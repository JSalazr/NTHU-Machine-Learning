    <h2>CHAPTER I.</h2><br>


    <p>She was coming, singing, down the side of Nebo
    Mountain&mdash;"Old Nebo"&mdash;mounted on an ox. Sun-kissed
    and rich her coloring; her flowing hair was like spun light;
    her arms, bare to the elbows and above, might have been the
    models to drive a sculptor to despair, as their muscles played
    like pulsing liquid beneath the tinted, velvet skin of wrists
    and forearms; her short skirt bared her shapely legs above the
    ankles half-way to the knees; her feet, never pinched by shoes
    and now quite bare, slender, graceful, patrician in their
    modelling, in strong contrast to the linsey-woolsey of her gown
    and rough surroundings, were as dainty as a dancing girl's in
    ancient Athens.</p>

    <p>The ox, less stolid than is common with his kind, doubtless
    because of ease of life, swung down the rocky path at a good
    gait, now and then swaying his head from side to side to nip
    the tender shoots of freshly leaving laurel. She
    sang:</p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Woodpecker pecked as
    a woodpecker will,</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Jim thought 'twas a knock on
    the door of the still,</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">He grabbed up his gun, and he
    went for to see,</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">The woodpecker laughed as he
    said: 'Jest me!'"</span><br>


    <p>She laughed, now, not at the song, which was purely
    automatic, but in sheer joy of living on that wonderful June
    day in those marvellous Kentucky mountains. Their loneliness
    did not depress her; indeed, to her, they were not lonely, but
    peopled by a host of lifelong friends who had greeted her at
    birth, and would, she had every reason to suppose, speed her
    when her end came. Their majesty did not overwhelm her,
    although she felt it keenly, and respected it and loved it with
    a certain dear, familiar awe. And everywhere about her was the
    Spring. Laurel blossomed at the trail's sides, filling the
    whole air with fragrance; the tardier blueberry bushes crowding
    low about it had begun to show the light green of their
    bursting buds; young ferns were pushing through the coverlet of
    last autumn's leaves which had kept them snug against the
    winter's cold, and were beginning to uncurl their delicate and
    wondrous spirals; maple and beech were showing their new
    leaves. The air was full of bird-notes&mdash;the plaintively
    pleading or exultantly triumphant cries of the mating season's
    joy and passion. Filmy clouds, like scattered, snowy ostrich
    plumes, floated, far, far up above her on a sea of richest
    blue; a fainter blue of springtime haze dimmed the depths of
    the great valley which a wide pass gave her vision of off to
    the left&mdash;and she was rather glad of this, for the haze,
    while, certainly, it hid from her much beauty, also hid the
    ugly scars which man was making there on nature's face, the
    cuts and gashes with which the builders of the new railway were
    marring the rich pasture lands.</p>

    <p>She turned from this to pleasanter and wilder prospects,
    close at hand, as her path narrowed, and began to sing again in
    sheer joyousness of spirit.</p><span style=
    "margin-left: 3em;">"Mr. Woodpecker laughed as a woodpecker
    will,</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">As Jim stood lookin' out of the
    door of the still,</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">'Mr. Jim,' he remarked, 'I have
    come for to ax</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Ef</i> you'd give me a worm
    for my revenue tax'!"</span><br>


    <p>The placid ox, plodding slowly down the trail, did not
    swerve when the bushes parted suddenly at one side, as she
    finished this verse of her song, but Madge Brierly looked about
    with a quick alertness. The sound of the rustling leaves and
    crackling twigs might mean a friend's approach, they might mean
    the coming of one of the very enemies whom the song had hinted
    at so lightly, but against whom all the people of the mountains
    keep perpetual watch, they might even mean a panther, hungry
    after his short rations of the winter and recklessly determined
    on a meal at any cost.</p>

    <p>But it was Joe Lorey's face which greeted her as she
    abruptly turned to see. His coon-skin cap, his jerkin and
    trousers of faded blue-jeans, his high, rusty boots matched
    perfectly with his primitive environments. As he appeared only
    the old-fashioned Winchester, which he carried cradled in his
    crooked elbow, spoke of the Nineteenth century. His face,
    though handsome in a crudely modelled way, had been
    weather-beaten into a rough, semi-fierceness by the storms
    through which he had watched the mountain-passes during the
    long winter for the raiders who were ever on his trail. The
    slightly reddened lids of his dark, restless eyes, told of long
    nights during which the rising fumes of moonshine whisky
    stealthily brewing in his furtive still, cave-hidden, had made
    them smart and sting. Even as, smilingly, he came up to the
    strangely mounted maid, there was on his face the strong trace
    of that hunted look which furtive consciousness of continual
    and unrelenting pursuit gives to the lawbreaker&mdash;even to
    the lawbreaker who believes the laws he breaks are wrong and to
    be violated without sin and righteously.</p>

    <p>"That you, Joe?" said the girl. "You skeered me."</p>

    <p>"Did I?" he replied, grinning broadly. "Didn't plan to."</p>

    <p>From far below there came the crash of bursting powder.
    Quick and lithe as a panther the man whirled, ready with his
    rifle. The girl laughed.</p>

    <p>"Nothin' but the railroad blastin' down there in the
    valley," she said with amusement. "Ain't you uset to that,
    yet?"</p>

    <p>"No," said he, "I ain't&mdash;an' never will be."</p>

    <p>His tone was definitely bitter. Never were the "sounds of
    progress more ungraciously received than there among the
    mountains by the folk who had, hedged in by their fastnesses,
    become almost a race apart, ignorant of the outside world's
    progressions and distrustful and suspicious of them.</p>

    <p>"Where you goin', Madge?" he asked, plodding on beside the
    lurching ox.</p>

    <p>"I ain't tellin'," she said briefly. "But you can go part
    ways&mdash;you can go fur as th' pasture bars."</p>

    <p>"Why can't I go as fur as you go?"</p>

    <p>"Because," said she, and laughed. "I reckon maybe that th'
    water's started to warm up down in the pool, ain't it?" she
    cried, and laughed again.</p>

    <p>"Oh!" said he, a bit abashed, and evidently
    understanding.</p>

    <p>They did not pursue the subject.</p>

    <p>"What you got there?" he inquired, a few moments later, as
    they were approaching the old pasture. He pointed to a package
    carefully wrapped in a clean apron, which she hugged beneath
    her arm.</p>

    <p>"Spellin' book," said Madge, as, just before the bars she
    slid down from her perch upon the ox. "I'm learnin'."</p>

    <p>His lip curled with the mountaineer's contempt for books and
    all they have to teach.</p>

    <p>"What you want to <i>learn</i> for?"</p>

    <p>He had gently shouldered her aside as she had stooped to
    raise the bars back to position, and, with a certain crude
    gallantry, had done the task himself.</p>

    <p>"Bleeged," she said briefly, and then, standing with one
    brown and rounded arm upon the topmost rail, paused in
    consideration of an answer to his question.</p>

    <p>The ox stopped, dully, close within the closed gap in the
    rough fence. She went closer to him and patted his side kindly.
    "Go on, old Buck," she said. "I'm through with you for quite a
    while. Go on and have some fun or rest, whichever you like
    best. You certainly can stand a lot of rest! And here is new
    spring grass, Buck. I should think you would be crazy to git at
    it."</p>

    <p>As if he understood, the old ox turned away, and, slowly,
    with careful searching for the newest and the tenderest of the
    forage blades which had pushed up to meet the pleasant
    sunshine, showed he was well fed at all times.</p>

    <p>"What do I want to learn for?" the girl repeated, returning
    to Joe's question. "Why&mdash;why&mdash;I don't know, exactly.
    There's a longin' stirrin' in me.</p>

    <p>"While you was over yon" (she waved her hand in a broad
    sweep to indicate the mountain's other side). "I had to go down
    into town after&mdash;after quite a lot of things." She looked
    at him somewhat furtively, as if she feared this statement
    might give rise to some unwelcome questioning, but it did not.
    "I saw what queer things they are doin'&mdash;th' men that work
    there on that railroad buildin'. Wonderful things, lots of 'em,
    and the bed-rock of 'em all was learnin'. I watched a gang of
    'em for near plum half a day. There wasn't a thing they did
    that they didn't first read from a sheet of paper about. If
    they hadn't had them sheets and if they couldn't read what had
    been written on 'em, why, they couldn't never <i>build</i> no
    railroad. And not only that&mdash;they got all kinds of comfort
    out of it. They have their books that tell 'em what other men
    have done before 'em, they have their newspapers that tell
    'em&mdash;<i>everyday</i>, Joe&mdash;what other men are doin',
    everywhere, fur as th' earth is spread.</p>

    <p>"They <i>know</i> things, them men do, and they're heaps
    happier because of it." She paused, leaning on the old worn
    fence.</p>

    <p>"An' their wimmen knows things," she went on. "I'm goin' to,
    too. It's th' greatest comfort that they've got. I'm goin' to
    <i>have</i> that comfort, Joe!"</p>

    <p>She patted the new spelling book as if it were a precious
    thing.</p>

    <p>"I'm goin' to have that comfort," she continued. "I'm goin'
    to know th' ins an' outs o' readin' an'" (she sighed and paused
    a second, as if this next seemed more appalling) "an' of
    writin'. Dellaw! That's hard! All sorts of curves an' twists
    an' ups an' downs an' things, an' ev'ry one means
    somethin'!"</p>

    <p>Joe looked at her, half in admiration, half in apprehension.
    "You goin' to git too good fer these here mountings?" he
    inquired.</p>

    <p>She gazed about her with a little intake of the breath, a
    little sign of ecstasy, of her appreciation of the wondrous
    view.</p>

    <p>"Too good for these here mountings?" she said thoughtfully.
    "Learnin' couldn't make me that! It might show me how to love
    'em more. Nothin' in th' world, Joe, could make me love 'em
    less!"</p>

    <p>He became more definite, a bit insistent. It had been plain,
    for long, that it had required some self-control for him to
    walk as he had walked, close by her side, without some
    demonstration of his admiration for her, to stand there with
    her at the bars without some sign that in her presence he found
    happiness much greater than he had ever known, could ever know,
    elsewhere.</p>

    <p>"You goin' to git too good fer&mdash;me?" he asked.</p>

    <p>She turned toward him impulsively. Great friendship shone
    frankly in her fine eyes. On her face was that expression of
    complete and understanding comradery which one child chum may
    show another. Almost she said as much of him as she had said of
    the surrounding mountains, but there was that upon his face
    which stopped her. It was too plain that friendship was not
    what he wanted, would not satisfy him. There was a hungry
    yearning in his eyes, mute, respectful, worshipful, not for
    comradery, but for a closer tie. She had watched this grow in
    him within the recent months, with worry and regret. It seemed
    to her a tragedy that their old friendship should ever prove
    inadequate.</p>

    <p>"No," she answered gently, "I shall never get too good for
    you, Joe&mdash;for any of my friends."</p>

    <p>He looked, almost with aversion, at the book she held so
    closely. He distrusted books. Instinctively he felt them to be
    enemies.</p>

    <p>"If you get them there ideas about learnin', an' all that,
    you will!" he gruffly said. "Leastways you'll be goin' off,
    some day an' leavin' us&mdash;me, the mountings an'&mdash;an'
    all yer friends up here."</p>

    <p>An expression of great earnestness, of almost fierce
    intensity grew in his face. "Madge," he said, "Madge Brierly,
    you're makin' a mistake! You're plannin' things to take you off
    from here; you're plannin' things to make you suffer, later on.
    You're gettin' bluegrass notions, an' bluegrass notions never
    did no mounting-born no good." He stepped closer to her.</p>

    <p>The latent fires in his approaching eyes were warning for
    her and she stepped back hastily. "Joe Lorey, you behave
    yourself!" said she. "I&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Can't ye see I love ye, Madge?" he asked, and then the
    fires died down, leaving in his eyes the pleading, worried look
    alone. "Why, Madge, I&mdash;"</p>

    <p>She tried to make a joke of it. "Joe Lorey," she said,
    laughing, "I reckon you're <i>plum</i> crazy. An' you ain't
    givin' me a chance to do what 'twas that I come down for."</p>

    <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I ain't goin' to listen to another word, to-day," said she,
    and waved him off.</p>

    <p>He went obediently, but slowly and unhappily, his rifle
    snuggling in the crook of his left elbow, his heavy boots
    finding firm footing in the rough and rocky trail as if by
    instinct of their own, without assistance from his brain. A
    "revenuer," coming up, just then, to bother him about his still
    and its unlawful product of raw whisky, would have met small
    mercy at his hands. He would have been a bad man, then, to
    quarrel with. His temper would have flared at slightest
    provocation. He would not let it flare at her; but, unseeing
    any of the beauties which so vividly appealed to her, the
    bitter foretaste of defeat was in his heart; and in his soul
    was fierce revolt and disappointment. He had not the slightest
    thought, however, of accepting this defeat as final.</p>

    <p>Madge watched him go with a look of keen distress upon her
    fresh and beautiful young face. She must not let him say what
    he had almost said, for she shrank from the thought of wounding
    him with the answer she felt in her heart that she would have
    to make. He had slouched off, half-way down the trail and out
    of sight, before she put the thoughts of the unpleasant
    situation from her mind and turned again to the great matter
    which had brought her there, that day.</p>

    <p>With a last glance at the gap in the rail fence, to make
    sure that it had been carefully replaced, so that there could
    be no danger of finding her ox gone when she returned, she
    started down the mountain, by a path different from that which
    Joe had taken.</p>

    <p>She had not gone very far, when, from a clump of bunch-grass
    just in front of her, only partly, yet, renewed by the new
    season, a hare hopped awkwardly, endeavoring to make off. Its
    progress was one-sided, difficult.</p>

    <p>Instantly she saw that it was wounded and with a little cry
    she ran toward it and caught it. Instinctively the tiny animal
    seemed to recognize her as a friend and ceased to struggle. One
    of its fore legs had been broken, as she quickly saw.</p>

    <p>With a little exclamation of compassion, she sat down upon a
    hummock, tore from her skirt a bit of cloth, found, on the
    ground, two twigs, made of these crude materials rude splints
    and bandages, bound the wounded creature, and sent it on its
    painful way again. She sighed as, after having watched it for a
    moment, she arose.</p>

    <p>"Pears like us human bein's always was a-hurtin' somethin',"
    she soliloquized, distressed. "Thar some chap has left that
    rabbit in misery behind him, and here I've sent Joe Lorey down
    the mountain with a worse hurt than it's got." She sighed. "It
    certain air a funny world!" she said.</p>

    <p>The subject of the wounded rabbit did not leave her mind
    until she had clambered down the rocky path half-way to the
    small stream which she sought below. She was ever ready with
    compassion for the suffering, especially for dumb and helpless
    suffering animals, and, besides, the episode had puzzled her.
    Who was there in those mountains who would <i>wound</i> a
    rabbit? Joe might have shot one, as might any other of the
    mountain dwellers who chanced to take a sudden fancy for a
    rabbit stew for supper, but Joe nor any of the other natives
    would have left it wounded and in suffering behind him. Too
    sure their markmanship, too careful their use of ammunition,
    for such a happening as that. Trained in the logic of the
    woods, the presence of the little suffering animal was a proof
    to her that strangers were about. The people of the mountains
    regard all strangers with suspicion. Half-a-dozen times she
    stopped to listen, half-a-dozen times she started on again
    without having heard an alien sound. Once, from the far
    distance, she did catch a faint metallic clinking, as of the
    striking of a hammer against rock, but it occurred once only,
    and she finally attributed it to the mysterious doings of the
    railroad people in the valley.</p>

    <p>Down the path she sped, now, rapidly and eagerly. It was
    plain that something which she planned to do when she reached
    her destination filled her with anticipation of delight, for
    her red lips parted in a smile of expectation as charming as a
    little child's, her breath came in eager pantings not due
    wholly to the mere exertion of the rapid downward climb. When,
    beyond a sudden turn in the rude trail, she suddenly saw spread
    before her the smooth waters of a pool, formed by the creek in
    a hill-pocket, she cried aloud with pleasure.</p>

    <p>"Ah," said she. "Ah! Now here we be!"</p>

    <p>But it was not at this first pool she stopped. Leaving the
    path she skirted its soft edge, instead, and, after having
    passed down stream some twenty yards or more, pushed her
    skilled way between the little trees of a dense thicket and
    into a dim, shadowy woods chamber on beyond, where lay another
    pool, velvety, en-dusked, save for the flicker of the sunlight
    through dense foliage.</p>

    <p>Here her delight was boundless. She ran forward with the
    eagerness of a thirsty bird, and, leaning on the bank,
    supported by bent arms, bent down and drank with keenest relish
    of the cool spring waters gathered in the "cove," then dabbled
    her brown slender fingers in the shining depths, watching, with
    a smile, concentric, widening ripples as they hurried out
    across the glassy surface, to the ferned bank beyond. A few
    yards away a hidden cascade murmured musically. Through the
    sparse and tender foliage of spring above her, the sunlight
    flickered in bright, moving patches of golden brilliance,
    falling on the breast of her rough, homespun gown, like
    decorations given by a fairy queen. Around the water's edges
    budding plants and deep-hued mosses made a border lovely
    everywhere, and for long spaces deep and soft as velvet pile. A
    thrush called softly from the forest depths behind her. From
    the other side his mate replied in a soft twittering that told
    of love and confidence and comfort. A squirrel scampered up the
    trunk of a young beech, near by, and sat in the first crotch to
    look down at her, chattering. A light breeze sighed among the
    branches, swaying them in languorous rhythm, rustling them in
    soft and ceaseless whisperings.</p>

    <p>All these familiar, pleasant sights and sounds delighted
    her. During the long winter she had been shut away from this,
    her favorite spot among the many lovely bits of wilderness
    about her, and now its every detail filled her with a fresh and
    keen delight. She looked and listened greedily, as happy as a
    city child, seated, for the first time in a space of months,
    before a brightly lighted stage to watch a pantomime. A dozen
    times she ran with little, bird-like cries to bend above some
    opening wild-flower, a space she spent in watching two intently
    busy king-birds, already fashioning their nest. Another
    squirrel charmed her beyond measure by sitting, for a moment,
    on a limb to gaze at her in bright-eyed curiosity, and then,
    with a swift run down the trunk, quite near to her, as if
    entirely satisfied that he saw in her a certain friend,
    scuttling to the water's edge for drink. She had never seen a
    squirrel drink before&mdash;few people have&mdash;and she
    stood, as motionless as might a maid of marble, watching him,
    until, having had his fill, he gave his tail a saucy flirt and
    darted back to his beech fortress, to sit again upon his limb
    and chatter gossip at her.</p>

    <p>After he had gone back to his tree she looked carefully
    about her. It now became apparent that she had come there to
    the pool for some especial purpose and that she wished to be
    quite sure of privacy before she put it into execution, for she
    went first to the path by which she had descended, there to
    listen long, intently, then, with a lithe spring where the
    brook narrowed at the pool's mouth, to the other side, where,
    at some distance in the forest, by another woods-path's edge,
    she stood again, intent and harkening.</p>

    <p>Apparently quite satisfied that so far as human beings went
    her solitude was quite complete, she returned, now, to the
    pool's edge and stood gazing down upon its polished surface.
    Soon she dipped the toe of one brown, slender foot into it,
    evidently prepared to draw back hastily in case of too low
    temperature, but tempted, when she found the water warm, she
    gently thrust the whole foot in, and then, gathering her skirt
    daintily up to her knees, actually stepped into the water,
    wading with little shrill screams of delight.</p>

    <p>For a moment she stood poised there, both hands busy with
    her skirt, which was pulled back tight against her knees. Then,
    after another hasty glance around, she sprang out upon the bank
    with a quick gesture of determination, and, close by the
    thicket's edge, disrobed entirely and came back to the water as
    lovely as the dream of any ancient sculptor, as alluring as the
    finest fancy of the greatest painter who has ever touched a
    brush.</p>

    <p>Slim, graceful, sinuous, utterly unconscious of her
    loveliness, but palpitating with the sensuous joy of living,
    she might have been a wood nymph, issuing vivid, vital, from
    the fancy of a mediaeval poet. The sunlight flecked her
    beautiful young body with fluttering patches as of palpitant
    gold leaf. The crystal water splashed in answer to the play of
    her lithe limbs and fell about her as in showers of diamonds.
    Flowers and ferns upon the pool's edge, caught by the little
    waves of overflow, her sport sent shoreward, bowed to her as in
    a merry homage to her grace, her fitness for the spot and for
    the sport to which she now abandoned herself utterly, plunging
    gaily into the deepest waters of the basin. From side to side
    of its narrow depths she sped rapidly, the blue-white of the
    spring water showing her lithe limbs in perfect grace of motion
    made mystically indefinite and shimmering by refraction through
    the little rippling waves her progress raised. She raced and
    strained, from the pure love of effort, as if a stake of
    magnitude depended on her speed.</p>

    <p>Then, suddenly, this fever for fast movement left her and
    she slowed to languorous movement, no less lovely.</p>

    <p>The trout, which had been frightened into hiding by the
    splashing of her early progress, came timidly, again, from
    their dim lurking places, to eye this new companion of the bath
    with less distrust, more curiosity. With sinuous stroke, so
    slow it scarcely made a ripple, so strong it sent her steadily
    and firmly on her zig-zag way, she swam, now, back and forth,
    around about, from side to side and end to end in the deep
    pool, with keen enjoyment, each movement a new loveliness, each
    second bringing to her fascinating face some new expression of
    delight and satisfaction. Behind her streamed her flowing hair,
    unbound and free to ripple, fan-like, on the water; before her
    dainty chin a little wave progressed, unbreaking, running back
    on either hand beside her, V-shaped. Her hands rose in the
    water, caught it in cupped palms and pushed it down and
    backward with the splashless pulsing thrust of the truly expert
    swimmer.</p>

    <p>Only the warm blood of perfect health could have endured the
    temperature of that shaded mountain pool so long, and soon even
    she felt its chill gripping her young muscles, and, as
    unconscious of her wholly revealed loveliness as any nymph of
    old mythology, scrambled from the water to the bank and stood
    there where a shaft of comfortable sunshine found its welcome
    way through rifted foliage above. To this she turned first one
    bare shoulder, then the other, with as evident a sensuous
    delight as she had shown when the cool water first closed over
    her. Then, throwing back her head, she stood full in the
    brilliance, and, inhaling deeply, let the sunlight fall upon
    the loveliness of her young chest. The delight of this was far
    too great for voiceless pleasure, and her deep, rich laughter
    rippled out as liquid and as musical as the tones of the tiny
    waterfall above the pool. She raised a knee and then the other
    to let the vitalizing sunlight fall upon them; then, with head
    drooped forward on her breast, stood with her sturdy but
    delicious shoulders in its shining path. Her happiness was
    perfect and she smiled continually, even when she was not
    giving vent to audible expressions of enjoyment.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, however, this idyllic scene was interrupted. In
    the woods she heard the crashing of an awkward footstep and a
    muttered word or two in a strange voice, as might come from a
    lowlander whose face has suffered from the sting of a
    back-snapping branch.</p>

    <p>For an instant she poised, frightened, on the bank. The
    intruder's crashing progress was bringing him, as her ears
    plainly told her, steadily in her direction. Panic-stricken,
    for a moment, she crouched, hugging her bare limbs in an
    ecstasy of fear. To get her clothes and put them on before he
    reached the pool would be impossible, a hasty glance about her
    showed no cover thick enough to flee to.</p>

    <p>One concealment only offered perfect hiding&mdash;the very
    pool from which she had so recently emerged. She poised to slip
    again into the water noiselessly and then caught sight of her
    disordered clothing on the bank. To leave it there would as
    certainly reveal her presence as to remain on the bank herself!
    Hastily she gathered it and the new spelling book into her
    arms, and, with not ten seconds of spare time to find the cover
    which she so desperately needed, endeavored to slip quietly
    into the pool again.</p>

    <p>Her certainty of movement failed her, this time, though, and
    one foot slipped. Into the pool she went, half-falling, and
    with a splash which, she was certain, would be audible a
    hundred yards away. Terrified anew by this, she dived quickly
    to the bottom of the pool and with all a trout's agility and
    fearlessness, her clothing and beloved book clasped tight
    against her bosom by her crooked left arm, her right arm
    sending her with rapid strokes, when she was quite submerged,
    the full length of the pool to its far end. There a fallen
    tree, relic of some woodland tempest of years gone by, extended
    quite from bank to bank, moss-covered, half hidden by small
    rushes and a little group of other water-plants. She dived
    beneath this log with the last atom of endurance she possessed
    and rose, perforce, upon the other side, stifling her gasps,
    but drawing in the air in long, luxurious breathings. With her
    mouth not more than half-an-inch above the water and her feet
    upon hard bottom, she crouched there, watching through the
    screen of plants, her clothes and book still pressed against
    her breast.</p>

    <p>As she peered across the log between the rushes, she saw the
    stranger, with a wary step, break through the undergrowth about
    the pool&mdash;cautiously, expectantly. The water heaved a bit
    about her chin, for her hidden chest was palpitating with the
    short, sharp intakes of a chuckling laughter.</p>

    <p>"Thought I were a b'ar, most likely!" she thought merrily,
    quite certain of the safety of her hiding place. "Some
    furriner." All strangers, in the mountains, are spoken of as
    "foreigners" and regarded with a hundred times the wonder and
    distrust shown in cities to the native of far lands,
    remote.</p>

    <p>Her guess was shrewd. The stranger had plainly been
    attracted by the sounds of her delighted splashing and had
    hurried up with rifle ready for a shot at some big game. Now he
    stood upon the granite edges of the pool, disappointed even in
    his instinctive search for footprints, with only the slowly
    widening circles left upon the surface by her hurried flight to
    show him that he had not wholly been mistaken in his thought
    that something most unusual had recently occurred there in the
    "cove." Eagerly his disappointed glance roved around the
    circling thicket&mdash;nowhere did it see a sign. When it
    neared the place of her concealment the hidden girl ducked,
    softly, making no undue commotion in the swiftly running water
    at the pool's outlet, and the searching glance passed on, quite
    unsuspecting, before her breath failed and her head emerged
    again.</p>

    <p>"Confound it!" the deeply disappointed youth exclaimed. "I
    was dead certain I heard something. I <i>did</i> hear
    something, too." He sighed. "But it is gone, now."</p>

    <p>At length he turned away in a bad temper, and presently she
    heard him crashing awkwardly through brush and brake,
    departing.</p>

    <p>Shivering from her long submersion in the gelid waters of
    the mountain stream, she cautiously emerged, struggling between
    light-hearted laughter at the comedy of her escape and rueful
    worry about the fact that she was not only deeply chilled but
    had no clothes which were not wet. Her soaked spelling-book,
    also, gave her much concern. Before she spread her clothing out
    in the sparse sunlight, she took the dripping volume to the
    warmest little patch of brilliance on any of the rocks
    surrounding, and, as she opened its leaves to catch the
    sunshine, examined it with loving solicitude to find how badly
    it was damaged.</p>

    <p>"Fast color," she said happily, looking at the mighty
    letters of its coarse black print. "Ain't faded none, nor run,
    a mite." This plainly give her great relief. Deftly she turned
    each leaf, using the extremest care to avoid tearing them,
    handling them with loving touch. Between them she laid little
    pine cones, so that air might circulate among them and assist
    the process of their drying. Then, having wrung her clothing
    till her strong, brown, slender wrists ached, she spread that
    out in turn, but on less favored rocks, and, as her feeling of
    security increased, fell into an unconscious dance, born of the
    necessity of warmth from exercise, but so full of grace,
    abandon, joy, that a poet might have fancied her a river-nymph,
    tripping to the reed-born music of the goat-hoofed Pan.</p>

    <p>When, later, she had slowly dressed, and was kneeling at the
    pool's edge, using the now placid surface of the water as a
    mirror to assist her in rough-fashioning her hair into a
    graceful knot, she heard again, from a great distance, a
    metallic "tink, tink-tink," which had caught her ear when she
    had first stood on the pool's edge. It came, she knew, from
    far, however, and so did not rouse her apprehension, but,
    mildly, it aroused her curiosity.</p>

    <p>"Hull kentry's 'full o' furriners," she mused. "That
    railroad buildin' business in the valley brings 'em. Woods
    ain't private no more." Again the tink, tink-tink. "Sounds like
    hammerin' on rocks," she thought. "It's nearer than th'
    railroad builders, too. I wonder what&mdash;but then, them
    furriners are wonderful for findin' out concernin'
    ev'rythin'."</p>

    <p>She hugged her pulpy spelling book against her breast with a
    little shiver of determination. "<i>I'm</i> goin' to l'arn,
    too," she said with firm decision as she scrambled up the rough
    and rocky mountain path.</p>

    <p>For a time, as she progressed, her thoughts remained afield,
    wandering in wonder of what that "furriner" might be up to with
    the tink-tink of his hammer upon rocks. This soon passed,
    however, and they dwelt again on the pool episode.</p>

    <p>She had never seen a man dressed as the stranger had been. A
    carefully made shooting-jacket had covered broad and
    well-poised shoulders which were free of that unlovely stoop
    which comes so early to the mountaineer's. A peaked cap of
    similar material had shaded slightly a broad brow with skin as
    white as hers and whiter. Beneath it, eyes, which, although
    they were engaged in anxious search when she had seen them, she
    knew could, upon occasion, twinkle merrily, had gazed, clear,
    calm, and brown. A carefully trimmed mustache had hidden the
    man's upper lip, but his chin, again a contrast to the
    mountaineers' whom she had spent her life among, showed blue
    from constant and close shaving. Yet, different as he was from
    her people of the mountains, as she recalled that face she
    could not hate him or distrust him.</p>

    <p>She had never in her life seen any one in knickerbockers and
    leggins before, and the memory of his amused her somewhat, yet
    she admitted to herself that they had seemed quite "peart" as
    she peered at them through the reeds.</p>

    <p>But it was the modern up-to-date Winchester which he had
    held, all poised to fly up to the ready shoulder should he find
    the splashing animal which had attracted his attention by its
    noise, which, next to his handsome, clean-cut face, had most
    aroused her admiration.</p>

    <p>"Lordy! Joe'd give his eyes to hev a gun like that," she
    said.</p>

    <p>And then she made a pun, unconscious of what the outer world
    calls such things, but quite conscious of its humor. "Thought I
    was a b'ar," she chuckled. "Well, I certainly <i>was</i>
    b'ar!"</p>

    <p>Feeling no further fear of any one, defiant, now that she
    was fully clothed, of "furriners," rather hoping, as a matter
    of fact that she might sometime meet this one again, she let
    her laugh ring out unrestrained. A cat-bird answered it with a
    harsh cry; a blue-jay answered him with a still harsher note.
    But then a brown thrush burst into unaccustomed post-meridian
    song. Even his throbbing trills and thrilling, liquid
    quaverings, had not more melody in them, however, than had her
    ringing laughter.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER II</h2><br>


    <p>Her laugh, too, roused more than vagrant birds into
    attention. She had emerged from the abrupt little valley and
    was entering upon a plateau which had been left comparatively
    open by the removal of great trees, sacrificed to furnish ties
    for the new railroad building in the lowlands. The place was
    littered with the discarded tops of pines and other woodland
    rubbish and seemed forlorn and wrecked. She swept her eyes
    about with the glance of a proprietor, for Madge Brierly owned
    all of this as well as most of the land through which the brook
    which deepened into the pool of her adventure flowed. Indeed
    the girl was counted rich among her fellows and owned, also,
    land down in the valley on which she would not live, but which
    she rented for an annual sum to her significant, although it
    would not have kept a lowland belle in caramels.</p>

    <p>In the center of the disordered clearing just before her,
    was the person who, like the birds, had been roused to keen
    attention by the maiden's ringing laugh. She saw him first
    while he was peering here and there, astonished, to learn
    whence the sound had come, and, with the instinctive caution of
    the mountain-bred, she quickly stepped behind a clump of
    laurel, through which she peered at him.</p>

    <p>He was a man of sixty years, or thereabouts, wiry, tough and
    well preserved. His hair, of grizzled grey, was longer than
    most men wore theirs, even among the mountains, where there are
    few conventionalities in male attire. He was dressed in the
    ordinary garb of the Kentucky planter of the better
    class&mdash;broad soft hat, flowing necktie, long frock-coat,
    which formed a striking contrast to the coarse high-boots into
    the tops of which his trousers had been tucked&mdash;and yet he
    hardly seemed to her to belong to the class of gentlemen to
    which his dress apparently assigned him. His face was coarse
    and hard, his eyes, as he peered about in search of her, were
    "shifty," she assured herself. His hands were large and crudely
    fashioned.</p>

    <p>"'Pears like 'most ev'ry one is roamin' 'round my land
    to-day," she thought. "I wonder what <i>this</i> one is up to,
    thar?"</p>

    <p>For fully fifteen minutes her curiosity remained
    unsatisfied, for, startled by the ringing laugh, the stranger
    spent at least a quarter of an hour in furtive peering, here
    and there, about the clearing, plainly searching for the
    laughter. At no time, however, did he approach her hiding place
    near enough to see her, and, finally, apparently satisfied that
    his ears had fooled him, or that whoever it had been who had
    disturbed him with the merry peal had gone away, he went back
    to his work.</p>

    <p>Just what this work could be was what she waited curiously
    to see. She felt not the least resentment of the trespass it
    involved, for the land was wild, and on it, as elsewhere in the
    mountains, any one was free to come and go who did not commit
    the foolishness of neglecting camp fires, likely to start
    forests into blaze, or the supreme treachery of giving
    information to the revenue officials about hidden stills. Her
    eager curiosity was aroused, more by the mysterious nature of
    the stranger's operations than by the fact that they were
    conducted on her land.</p>

    <p>Having satisfied himself that no one, now, was near, and,
    therefore, that he was not watched, the unpleasantly mysterious
    old man went back to the work which evidently had brought him
    hither. With utmost care he moved about the place, scrutinizing
    outcropping rocks, and this, as they were everywhere, meant a
    minute examination of the land. In his hand he carried a small
    hammer, and, with this, now and then, after a careful visual
    examination of a rock, he knicked it, here and there,
    investigating carefully and even eagerly the scars he made, the
    bits of rock which were clipped off, now and then even looking
    at the latter through a magnifying glass, which he took for the
    purpose from a pocket of his vest.</p>

    <p>She had watched these operations, fascinated, for, possibly,
    a full half hour, despite the discomfort of damp clothing,
    which had begun to chill her, when she saw signs of violent
    excitement on the old man's face and in his actions, after he
    had chipped a rock, from which he first had had to scrape a
    thin superstratum of light soil.</p>

    <p>Like a miner who has found the gold for which, for years, he
    has been searching, he arose, with the tiny fragments in his
    hand, to look at them with greedy eyes, in a more comfortable,
    upright posture. His face had very plainly paled and in his
    eyes was an expression of such avaricious eagerness and
    satisfaction as she had never seen before upon a human
    countenance.</p>

    <p>Before he made a sound she knew that he had found that thing
    for which he had been seeking. His grizzled countenance, intent
    as any alchemist's of old upon his search, and, as its
    absorption grew, continually less a pleasant face to
    contemplate, now twisted, suddenly, into an expression of
    incredulous joy. He took the fragment he had been examining in
    both his hands and held it close before his eyes. Then he made
    a minute search of it with his little magnifying glass. Then he
    fell upon his knees, and, with his clawlike fingers, scraped
    more earth from the rock whence he had chipped it.</p>

    <p>Satisfied by what he saw there, after he had done this, he
    rose with a new expression on his face&mdash;so crafty, so
    exultant, and, withal, so evil, that Madge involuntarily shrank
    back to better screening in her leafy hiding place.</p>

    <p>The old man, with sweeping movements of his heavily booted
    feet, swept the thin earth he had scraped from the rock's
    surface back into its place, thrust the fragments deep into his
    pocket, and started hurriedly away, plainly greatly pleased,
    along the trail which led into the valley. She watched him with
    a beating heart, much puzzled.</p>

    <p>What could it be that he had found, there, on her land?
    Visions of gold mines and of diamonds, rose within her mind,
    crude, unformed, childish, based on the imperfect knowledge she
    had gained of such things from the story-tellers of the
    mountains. As mountain people go she was, already, a rich
    woman, but now dreams of mightier wealth swept through her
    brain tumultuously. Ah, she would buy happiness for all her
    friends when she had, later on, unearthed the secret treasures
    of her backwoods clearing! Maybe she would, sometime, have a
    <i>real silk dress</i>!</p>

    <p>She hurried forward in a stooping run to make examination of
    the place, as soon as the old man had vanished down the
    mountain side, to see (she thoroughly expected it) the glitter
    of bright gems or yellow gold beneath the sand which he had
    with such care spread back upon the little scar which he had
    made there in the earth. With trembling fingers she pushed back
    the yellow earth, and found&mdash;nothing but black rock,
    uncouth, and unattractive.</p>

    <p>She sat there on the ground in her damp skirts, too
    disappointed, for a moment, to make an exclamation. In many
    ways the girl, although well past her sixteenth year, was but a
    child. The reaction from the mighty dreams of fortune she had
    built almost unnerved her.</p>

    <p>It was her native humor which now saved her. Instead of
    weeping she burst into sudden laughter.</p>

    <p>"Dellaw!" said she, aloud. "Ain't I a fool? The man was just
    a crazy!"</p>

    <p>For some time she sat there in the rocky clearing amidst the
    litter of pine-tops and small undergrowth, contemplating her
    own silliness with keen amusement.</p>

    <p>"Why, he had me that stirred up," said she, "that I reckoned
    I was rich a'ready!"</p>

    <p>But she put the joke aside, to be told upon herself when the
    first chance came. Her long hiding in the thicket while she
    watched the queer proceedings of the stranger had chilled her
    through and through.</p>

    <p>Close to the black rock which had so excited him and which
    she had uncovered after he had gone, a little forked stick
    stood upright, and in its fork, with one end slanted to the
    ground, a twig of green witch-hazel still reposed. Beneath the
    twig a tiny spiral of arizing smoke showed that here, with
    these primitive appliances, the treasure seeker had prepared
    his dinner, later carefully covering his fire.</p>

    <p>"No matter how queer he was dressed, or what queer things he
    did," she told herself, "he sure was mountain-born. This here's
    a mountain fireplace, sartin sure."</p>

    <p>She broke dead branches from a pine-top, not far away, but
    still far enough so that, with reasonable watching, it would
    not be endangered by a fire built on this spot (the old man
    plainly had considered this when he made the fire, for the
    place was almost the only one in all the clearing free enough
    from dry pine branches to make fire building safe) and laid
    them on the coals which he had buried, but which she now had
    carefully uncovered. She would, she had decided, dry her
    clothes before she started on the long, cool, woods-road climb
    up to her cabin.</p>

    <p>Kneeling by the coals and blowing on them, skillfully
    adjusting splinters so that they would catch the draft, she
    soon had started a small flame. Fed carefully, this grew
    rapidly. Within five minutes there was burning on the site of
    the old man's little cooking-fire a cheerful blaze of size. Its
    rushing warmth was very grateful to her, and she held her hands
    out to it, then her feet, one after the other, with skirts
    lifted daintily, so that her chilled limbs might catch the
    warmth.</p>

    <p>Invigorated by the pleasant heat, she once more yielded to
    the urgings of the bounding spirit of rich youth within her.
    Even as she had sported in the water ere the interloper came to
    interrupt her sylvan bath, now she sported there about the fire
    in an impromptu dance, never for a second uncouth, despite the
    fact that she was quite untrained; scarcely less graceful than
    her merrymaking in the water, although then she had not been,
    as now, hampered in her grace of movement by the unlovely
    draperies of homespun linsey-woolsey. As she had been a
    water-nymph, so, now, she might have been some Druid maid
    dancing by an altar fire. The roughness of the ground did not
    annoy her&mdash;her feet had not known dancing upon polished
    waxen wood; the lack of spectators did not deter
    her&mdash;those whom she had learned to know and love, the
    mountains, trees, the squirrels, and birds, were there.</p>

    <p>In the very midst of the abandon of this rustic symphony of
    movement, the thought came to her that the precious
    spelling-book was lying on the rock, near by, quite soaked,
    neglected. She sped to it and took it to the fire's edge,
    where, opening its pages one by one, so that each would get the
    warmth, she held it as close as she opined was safe. Having
    dried it until she no longer feared the wetting it had had
    would seriously harm its usefulness (the lovely smoothness of
    its magic leaves was gone, alas! beyond recall) she paused
    there for a moment, herself still far from dry, with a bare
    foot held out to the blaze, and studied curiously one of the
    book's pages.</p>

    <p>Thereon the letters of the alphabet, large, ominous,
    suggestive to her mind of nothing in the world but curlycues,
    loomed, mystifying. For the first time it occurred to her that
    in securing the small volume she had not, as she had thought to
    do, solved the problem of an education. The characters, she saw
    to her dismay, meant nothing to her. In the absence of a
    teacher she could not learn from them!</p>

    <p>Alas, alas! The matter was a tragedy to her. How could she
    have been so stupid as to fail to think of this at first? She
    stood there with flushed face, despairing, looking at the
    mystic symbols with slowly sinking heart.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, though the crackling of the fire filled her ears,
    she was aware, by some subtle sense, that she was now not
    wholly solitary there. Without a sound to tell her, she was
    conscious that some other person had within the moment come
    into the clearing. Hastily she looked about. To her amazement,
    and, for a moment, to her great dismay, she saw, standing on
    the clearing's edge, the young man who had, not long before,
    unknowingly invaded her seclusion at the pool.</p>

    <p>Instantly her body became fiercely conscious. Prickling
    thrills, not due to bonfire heat, shot over it. Shame sent the
    blood in mantling blushes to her cheeks, although she tried to
    stop it. Why should she blush at sight of him? True, she had
    been there in the water, bare as any new-born babe, when he had
    reached the pool's edge&mdash;but he had not seen her. To him
    she, quite undoubtedly, was a mere strange mountain maid,
    unrecognized. Self-consciousness then was quite absurd.</p>

    <p>And this man was a stranger and was on her land. She must
    not forget her mountain courtesy and fail to make him
    welcome.</p>

    <p>"Howdy," she said briefly.</p>

    <p>"Howdy, little girl?" said he, and looked at her and
    smiled.</p>

    <p>This form of address much amused her. She was not far beyond
    sixteen, but sixteen is counted womanhood, there in the
    mountains, and often is an age for wife&mdash;and motherhood as
    well. "Little girl," to her, seemed laughable. But then she
    suddenly remembered that to stop their flapping, when they were
    all soaked, against her ankles, she had pinned her skirts
    up&mdash;and she was not tall. The mistake, perhaps, was
    natural.</p>

    <p>"Got a fire here?" he inquired, inanely, for the fire was
    very much in evidence.</p>

    <p>"Looks like it, don't it?" she said somewhat saucily, but
    robbed the comment of offense by smiling somewhat shyly at him
    as he stood there.</p>

    <p>He was better looking, she reflected, now that she had an
    unobstructed view of him, even than he had appeared when she
    had peered at him from her concealment behind the log and
    barricade of rushes. Of course he was a "foreigner," and,
    therefore, a mere weakling, not to be considered seriously as a
    specimen of sturdy manhood (how often had she heard the
    mountain men speak of the lowlands men with scorn as
    weaklings?) but, none the less, he interested and attracted
    her, even if he did not inspire her with respect.</p>

    <p>He laughed. "It does," said he, "looks very much like it.
    Been burning brush?"</p>

    <p>"No," she replied, "jest warmin' up a little."</p>

    <p>"Why, it's not cold."</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I was wet."</p>

    <p>"<i>Wet?</i>" said he, astonished.</p>

    <p>She saw her slip, and flushed. "Fell in the crik," she
    answered briefly, hastily and falsely.</p>

    <p>"Why, that's too bad," said he, with ready sympathy,
    unfeigned and real.</p>

    <p>All the time the girl was eying him through often-lowered
    lashes, and the more she looked at him the more she felt that
    he was not, like many "foreigners," to be distrusted and be
    held aloof. His clothes did not suggest to her the "revenuer,"
    although they certainly were different from any she had ever
    seen before on man or beast (his knee breeches gave her some
    amusement), and he was totally unarmed, having laid his rifle
    down and left it at a distance, leaning against a stump.</p>

    <p>His hands and face were not sunburned&mdash;indeed, his
    hands were delicately fashioned and much whiter than any she
    had ever seen before on man or woman. His appearance certainly
    did not, to her, convey the thought of strength&mdash;and
    manhood, there among the mountains, is thought to find its
    first and last expression through its muscle; yet, for some
    reason, although her first glance made her think he was a puny
    creature, she neither scorned nor pitied him. He was, perhaps,
    too smoothly dressed, too carefully shaved; the gun he had laid
    down so carelessly had too much "bright work" on it&mdash;but
    on the whole, she liked him. A city maiden might have well been
    dazzled by the really handsome chap. This simple country girl
    was not&mdash;but, on the whole, she liked him.</p>

    <p>Her hand which held the spelling-book dropped,
    unconsciously, so that the open pages of the volume were
    revealed, upside down, against her knee.</p>

    <p>"Studying your lessons?" he inquired, quite casually,
    good-naturedly, coming nearer.</p>

    <p>Again her disappointment rushed upon her. Impulsively she
    told him of it.</p>

    <p>"Oh," said she, "I don't know how! I bought me this yere
    book down in th' settlement, an' thought I'd learn things outen
    it. But how'm I goin' to learn? I can't make nothin' out of it
    to get a start with."</p>

    <p>Instantly the pathos of this situation, not its humor, made
    appeal to him.</p>

    <p>"Isn't there a school here?" he inquired.</p>

    <p>"Nearest school is twenty mile acrost, over on Turkey
    Creek," she said briefly. "Oncet there was a nearer one, but
    teacher was a Hatfield, and McCoys got him, of course. This was
    McCoy kentry 'fore they all got so killed off. He ought to 'a'
    knowed better than come over here to teach."</p>

    <p>This casual reference to a famous feud&mdash;news of whose
    infamy had spread far, far beyond the mountains which had
    hatched it&mdash;from the lips of one so young and lovely (for
    he had long ago admitted to himself that as she stood there she
    was lovelier than any being he had ever seen before) appalled
    Frank Layson, son of level regions, graduate of Harvard, casual
    sportsman, amateur mountaineer, who had come to look over his
    patrimony and the country round about.</p>

    <p>"Ah&mdash;yes," said he, and frowned. And then: "It leaves
    you in hard luck, though, doesn't it, if you want to learn and
    can't," said he.</p>

    <p>"It sartin does, for&mdash;oh, I <i>do</i> hanker powerful
    to learn!"</p>

    <p>"May I stay here by the fire with you a while and get warm,
    too," he asked. (The unaccustomed exercise of tramping through
    the mountains had kept him in a fever heat all day.)</p>

    <p>"An' welcome," she said cordially, moving aside a bit, so
    that he could approach without the circumnavigation of a mighty
    stump.</p>

    <p>He could not tell whether or not she had made note of many
    sweat-beads on his brow and wondered at them on a chilly
    man.</p>

    <p>"Perhaps," said he, "I might, in a few minutes, show you a
    little about what you want to know. I've been lucky. I have had
    a chance to learn."</p>

    <p>She liked the way he said it. There was no hint of
    superiority about it. He was not "stuck up," in his claim of
    knowledge. He "had had a chance," and took no credit to himself
    for it. This pleased her, won her confidence&mdash;if, already,
    that had not been done by his frank face, in spite of his fancy
    clothes and her assumption that he was a namby-pamby
    weakling.</p>

    <p>"Oh&mdash;if you would!" she said, so eagerly that it seemed
    to him most pitiful.</p>

    <p>So, five minutes later, when all her clothing save her heavy
    outer skirt, had been quite dried there by the fire, and that
    same fire's abounding warmth had sent his temperature up to
    high discomfort mark, they sat down, side by side, upon a log,
    the spelling-book between them, and he began the pleasant task
    of teaching her her A, B, Cs.</p>

    <p>"'A,'" said he, "is this one at the very start."</p>

    <p>"The peaked one," said she.</p>

    <p>"Yes, that one.</p>

    <p>"And 'B,'" he went on, much amused, but with a perfectly
    grave face, "is this one with two loops fastened, so, to a
    straight stalk."</p>

    <p>"I know where thar <i>is</i> a bee-tree," she remarked,
    irrelevantly.</p>

    <p>"It will help recall this in your mind," said he,
    maintaining perfect gravity, "imagine it with two big loops of
    rope fastened to one side of it&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Rope wouldn't stick out that-a-way," said she, "it would
    just droop. They'd have to be of somethin' stiffen"</p>

    <p>"Well&mdash;" said he, and tried to think of something.</p>

    <p>"You could use that railroad-iron that I saw 'em heat
    red-hot an' bend, down in the valley," she suggested.</p>

    <p>"That's it," said he. "Two loops of railroad-iron fastened
    to a bee-tree" (he pointed) "just as these loops, here, are
    fastened to the straight black stem. That's 'B.'"</p>

    <p>"I won't forget," said she, her beautiful young brow
    puckered earnestly as she stored the knowledge in her
    brain.</p>

    <p>"And this is 'C,'" said he.</p>

    <p>"'C,' 'C'" said she. "Jest take off one of th' loops an' use
    it by itself."</p>

    <p>"That's so," said he. "And here is 'D'"</p>

    <p>"Cut off th' top th' tree," said she. "Just cut it plumb
    off, loop an' all."</p>

    <p>He laughed. It was clear that she would be an earnest and
    quick-thinking pupil to whomever had the task of giving her her
    education.</p>

    <p>As he looked at her, now, he for the first time fully
    realized her beauty. He had known, from the first, that she was
    most attractive, most unusual for a mountain maid; but now,
    laughing, although her head was still bent to the book, her big
    eyes, sparkling with her merriment, raised frankly to his face,
    were revelations to him. He had not seen such eyes before, and
    all the old-time similes for deep-brown orbs sprang instantly
    to mind. "Fathomless pools," "translucent amber"&mdash;no
    simile would really describe them. Late hours had never dimmed
    them, illness had never made them heavy, he was sure a lie had
    never made them shift from their straight gaze for one short
    second. He had not seen such eyes in cities!</p>

    <p>And from careful contemplation of the eyes, he kept on with
    a careful contemplation of the other beauties of his fair and
    unexpected pupil. Her homespun gown, always ill-shaped and now
    unusually protuberant in spots, unusually tight in others,
    because of its late wetting and impromptu, partial drying,
    could not hide the sylvan grave of her small-boned and lissome
    figure, just budding into womanhood. Her feet, crossed on the
    ground, were as patrician in their nakedness as any bluegrass
    belle's in satin slippers. Her ankles, scratched by casual
    thorns and already beginning to blush brown from the June sun's
    ardent kisses, were as delicate as any he had ever seen
    enmeshed in silken hose. Her hands, long, slender,
    taper-fingered, actually dainty, although brown and roughened
    by hard labor, were, it seemed to him, better fitted for the
    fingering of a piano's keys than for the coarse and heavy tasks
    to which he knew they must be well accustomed. He gazed at her
    in veritable wonder. How had she blossomed, thus, here in this
    wilderness?</p>

    <p>"Where do you live?" he asked, interrupting their scholastic
    efforts.</p>

    <p>"Up thar," she pointed, and, above, he could just see the
    top of a mud-and-stick chimney rise above a crag between the
    trees.</p>

    <p>"Have you brothers or sisters?"</p>

    <p>"Ain't got nobody," she answered, and to her face there came
    a look of keen resentment rather than of sorrow or of
    resignation. "I'm all th' feud left," she said simply. She
    looked at Layson quickly, wondering if he would be surprised
    that she should not have fought and also died. "Girl cain't
    fight alone, much," she went on, in hurried explanation, or,
    rather, quick excuse. "I might take a shot if I should git a
    chanst, but I ain't had none, an', besides, I guess it air plum
    wrong to kill, even if there's blood scores to be settled up. I
    toted 'round a rifle with me till last fall, but then I give it
    up. They won't git me&mdash;but maybe you don't know what feuds
    are in the mountings, here."</p>

    <p>He was looking at her with new interest. All his life he had
    heard much about the dreadful mountain feuds. As the bogey-man
    is used in Eastern nurseries, so are the mountaineers used in
    the nurseries of old Kentucky and of Tennessee to frighten
    children with. Their family fights, not less persistent or less
    deadly than the enmities between the warring barons of the
    Rhine in middle ages, form a magnificent foundation for dire
    tales.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said he, "I know about the feuds, of course. But
    you&mdash;"</p>

    <p>It did not seem possible to him, even after her frank
    statements, that this bright and joyous creature could in any
    way be joined to such a bloody history as he knew the histories
    of some of these long feuds to be.</p>

    <p>"It's been thirty years an' better," said the girl, "since
    the Brierlys and Lindsays had some trouble about a claybank
    filly an' took to shootin' one another&mdash;shootin' straight
    an' shootin' often an' to kill. For years th' fight went on.
    They fired on sight, an' sometimes 'twas a Lindsay went an'
    sometimes 'twas a Brierly. Bimeby there was just two men
    left&mdash;my pappy an' Lem Lindsay.</p>

    <p>"One day Lem sent word to my pappy to meet him without no
    weepons an' shake han's an' make it up."</p>

    <p>Her face took on a look of bitterness and hate which almost
    made her hearer shiver, so foreign was it to the fresh, young
    brightness he had watched till now.</p>

    <p>"My daddy come, at th' ap'inted time," she went on slowly,
    "but dad&mdash;he knowed Lem Lindsay, an' never for a minute
    trusted him. He ast a friend of his, Ben Lorey, to be a hidden
    witness. Ben hid behind a rock to watch. 'Twas right near
    here&mdash;just over thar." She pointed.</p>

    <p>"Soon Lem, he come along, a-smilin' like a Judast, an',
    after some fine speakin', as daddy offered him his hand, Lem
    whipped out a knife, an'&mdash;an' struck it into my daddy's
    heart."</p>

    <p>The girl's recital had been tense, dramatic, not because she
    had tried or thought to make it so&mdash;she had never learned
    not to be genuine&mdash;but because of the real and tragic
    drama in the tale she told, the matter-of-course way in which
    she told it.</p>

    <p>It made Layson shudder. What sort of people were these
    mountaineers who went armed to friendly meetings and struck
    down the men whose hands they offered to clasp? Where was the
    other man while his friend's enemy was at this dreadful
    work?</p>

    <p>"But Lorey," said her fascinated listener, "the man who was
    in hiding as a witness, made him pay for his outrageous
    act!"</p>

    <p>"No," said the girl, with drooping head. "He stepped out
    from behind the rock where he was hidin', an' he pulled the
    trigger of his rifle. But luck was dead against us that day.
    Wet powder&mdash;somethin'&mdash;nobody knows what. The gun did
    not go off. Before he got it well down from his shoulder so's
    to find out what it was that ailed it, Lem Lindsay was upon him
    like a mountain lion&mdash;an' he laid him thar beside my
    daddy. He didn't mean that there should be no witnesses."</p>

    <p>She paused so long that Layson was about to speak, feeling
    the silence troublesome and painful, but before he had decided
    what to say in comment on a tale so dreadful, she went on:</p>

    <p>"He didn't mean there should be no witnesses, Lem Lindsay
    didn't, but as it happened there was two. My mother, me clasped
    in her arms, had stole after my daddy, fearin' that somethin'
    wicked would come out o' that there meetin' with his old-time
    enemy. She spoke up sudden, an' surprised th' murderer,
    standin' there by th' two poor men he'd killed. At first it
    scared him. I can't remember everythin' about that awful day,
    but I can see Lem Lindsay's face as she screamed at him, just
    as plain this minute as I seed it then. I'll never forget that
    look if I live a thousand years!</p>

    <p>"At first he was struck dumb, but then that passed. He give
    a yell of rage an' started toward us on th' run. She jumped,
    with me a-hinderin' her. Like a mountain deer she run, in spite
    of that. She was lighter on her feet than he was upon his, an'
    soon outdistanced him. He hadn't stopped to pick his rifle
    up&mdash;he only had th' knife he'd done th' killin' with, so
    he couldn't do what he'd 'a' liked to done&mdash;shoot down a
    woman an' a baby!</p>

    <p>"We lived where I live now, alone, an' then, as now, there
    was a little bridge that took th' footpath over th' deep gully.
    Them days was wicked ones in these here mountains, an' daddy'd
    had that foot-bridge fixed so it would raise. My mother just
    had time to pull it up, when we had crossed, before Lem Lindsay
    reached there. He stopped, to keep from fallin' in the gully,
    but stood there, shakin' his bare fist an' swearin' that he'd
    kill us yet. But that he couldn't do. Folks was mightily
    roused, and he had to leave th' mountings, then an' thar, an'
    ain't been in 'em since, so far as anybody knows."</p>

    <p>Her brows drew down upon her eyes. Her sweet mouth hardened.
    "He'd better <i>never</i> come!" she added, grimly.</p>

    <p>After a moment's pause she went on, slowly: "So, now, here
    we be&mdash;Joe Lorey, Ben's son, an' me. My mother died, you
    see, not very many years after Lindsay'd killed my daddy.
    Seein' of it done, that way, had been too much for her. I
    reckon seein' it would have killed me, too, if I'd been more'n
    a baby, but I wasn't, an' lived through it. Ben's lived here,
    workin' his little mounting farm, an'&mdash;an'&mdash;"</p>

    <p>She hesitated, evidently ill at ease, strangely stammering
    over an apparently simple and unimportant statement of the
    condition of her fellow orphan. She changed color slightly.
    Layson, watching her, decided that the son of the one victim
    must be the sweetheart of the daughter of the other, and would
    have smiled had not the very thought, to his surprise, annoyed
    him unaccountably. Whether that was what had caused her
    stammering, he could not quite decide, although he gave the
    matter an absurd amount of thought. She went on quickly:</p>

    <p>"He's lived here, workin' of his little mounting farm
    an'&mdash;an'&mdash;an' doin' jobs aroun', an' such, an' I've
    lived here, a-workin' mine, a little, but not much. After my
    mother died there was some folks down in th' valley took keer
    of me for a while, but then they moved away, an' I was old
    enough to want things bad, an' what I wanted was to come back
    here, where I could see th' place where mother an' my daddy had
    both loved me an' been happy. I've got some land down in th'
    valley&mdash;fifty acres o' fine pasture&mdash;but I never
    cared to live down there. Th' rent I get for that land makes me
    rich&mdash;I ain't never wanted for a single thing but just th'
    love an' carin' that my daddy an' my mother would 'a' give me
    if that wicked man hadn't killed 'em both. For he <i>did</i>
    kill my mother, just as much as he killed daddy. She died o'
    that an' that alone."</p>

    <p>Again she fell into a silence for a time, looking out at the
    tremendous prospect spread before them, quite unseeing.</p>

    <p>"Oh," she went on, at length, her face again darkened by a
    frown, her small hands clenched, every muscle of her lithe
    young body drawn as taut as a wild animal's before a spring. "I
    sometimes feel as if I'd like to do as other mountain women
    have been known to do when killin' of that sort has blackened
    all their lives&mdash;I sometimes feel as if I'd like to take a
    rifle in my elbow an' go lookin' for that man&mdash;go lookin'
    for him in th' mountings, in th' lowlands, anywhere&mdash;even
    if I had to cross th' oceans that they tell about, in order to
    come up with him!"</p>

    <p>Her voice had been intensely vibrant with strong passion as
    she said this, and her quivering form told even plainer how
    deep-seated was the hate that gave birth to her words. But soon
    she put all this excitement from her and dropped her hands in a
    loose gesture of hopeless relaxation.</p>

    <p>"But I know such thoughts are foolish," she said drearily.
    "He got away. A girl can't carry on a feud alone, nohow.
    There's nothin' I can do."</p>

    <p>Again, now, with a passing thought, her features lighted as
    another maiden's, whose young life had been cast by fate in
    gentler places might have lighted at the thought of some great
    pleasure pending in the future.</p>

    <p>"There is a chance, though," she said, with a fierce joy,
    "that Lem Lindsay, if he is alive, 'll git th' bullet that he
    earned that day. Joe Lorey's livin'&mdash;that's Ben's
    son&mdash;an' he&mdash;well, maybe, some time&mdash;ah, he can
    shoot as straight as anybody in these mountings!"</p>

    <p>The look of a young tigress was on her face.</p>

    <p>It made the young man who was listening to her
    shudder&mdash;the look upon her face, the voice with which she
    said "And he can shoot as straight as anybody in these
    mountings!" For a second it revolted him. Then, getting a
    fairer point of view, he smiled at her with a deep sympathy,
    and waited.</p>

    <p>He had not to wait long before a gentler mood held
    dominance. It came, indeed, almost at once.</p>

    <p>"No," she said slowly, "a girl can't carry on a feud alone,
    nohow.... And, somehow, when I think of it most times, I really
    don't want to. It's only now an' then I get stirred up, like
    this. Most times I'd rather learn than&mdash;go on fightin'
    like we-all always have.... I'd rather learn, somehow....
    An'&mdash;an'&mdash;an' that's been mighty hard&mdash;<i>is</i>
    mighty hard"</p>

    <p>"You&mdash;haven't had much chance," said he, looking at her
    pityingly.</p>

    <p>She gave him a quick glance. Had she really thought he
    pitied her she would have bitterly resented it.</p>

    <p>"Had th' same chance other mounting girls have," she said
    quickly, defending, not herself, but her country and her
    people.</p>

    <p>She stood, now, at a distance from the fire, for it was
    blazing merrily, but her face was flushed by its radiant heat,
    its lurid blaze made a fine background for the supple, swaying
    beauty of her slim young body. She raised her arms high, high
    above her head, with that same genuineness of gesture, graceful
    and appealing, which he had seen in all her movements from the
    first and then clasped them at her breast.</p>

    <p>"But oh," said she, "somehow, I want to learn, now,
    terrible!"</p>

    <p>"Let me help you while I'm in the mountains," he replied,
    impulsively. "I'll be glad to help you every day."</p>

    <p>"Would you?" she said. "I would be powerful thankful!" Her
    bright eyes expressed the gratitude she felt.</p>

    <p>While they had talked a strange paradox had come about there
    by the fire without their notice. The long, black outcropping
    of rock against which they had brought the old man's blaze to
    life, had, instead of keeping the fire from spreading to the
    undergrowth, strangely permitted it to pass.</p>

    <p>It was the girl who first discovered this. She sprang up
    from her place with a startled exclamation.</p>

    <p>"Oh," said she, "th' fire is spreadin'!"</p>

    <p>He rose quickly to his feet.</p><br>

    <a name="CHAPTER_III"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER III</h2><br>


    <p>They were appalled by the predicament in which they found
    themselves. The thing seemed quite mysterious.</p>

    <p>The rock against which the fire had been built was all
    aglow, as if it had been heated in a furnace till red
    hot&mdash;strange circumstance; one that would have fascinated
    Layson into elaborate investigation had he had the time to
    think about it&mdash;and, beyond it, evidently communicated
    through it as a link, the rustling leaves of the past autumn,
    their surface layers sun-dried, were bursting into glittering
    little points of flame all about the narrow ledge of rock on
    which they were standing. As they gazed, before Layson could
    rush forward to stamp out these sparkling perils, the fire had
    spread, as the girl, wise in the direful ways of brush-fires,
    had known at once that it would spread, to the encircling
    pine-tops, left in a tinder barricade about the clearing by the
    sawyers and the axemen.</p>

    <p>"Oh," she said, distressed, "we're ketched!"</p>

    <p>Layson, less conscious of their peril because less well
    informed as to the almost explosive inflammability of dry
    pine-tops, took the matter less seriously. "We'll get out, all
    right," said he. "Don't worry."</p>

    <p>"There's times <i>to</i> worry," said the girl, "an' this, I
    reckon&mdash;well, it's one of 'em."</p>

    <p>As if to prove the truth of what she said, with a burst
    almost like that of flame's leap along a powder-line, the fire
    caught one resinous pine-top after another with a crackling
    rush which was not only fearfully apparent to the eye, but also
    ominously audible. Within ten seconds the pair were ringed by
    sound like that of crackling musketry upon a battlefield, and
    by a pyrotechnic spectacle of terrifying magnitude. Layson had
    heard guns pop in untrained volleys at State Guard manoeuvres,
    and was instantly impressed by the amazing similarity of sound,
    but he had never in his life seen anything to be compared to
    the towering ring of flame-wall which almost instantly
    encircled them. He lost, perhaps, a minute, in astonished
    contemplation of the situation. Then realization of their peril
    burst upon him with a rush. To wait there, where they were, too
    evidently meant certain death. Not only would the pulsing heat
    from the pine-tops already burning soon become unendurable, but
    there was enough of tindrous litter strewn about the entire
    area of the little clearing to make it horribly apparent to him
    that, in a moment, it would all become a bed of glittering
    flame. He gazed at the menacing, encroaching fire,
    appalled.</p>

    <p>Madge, understanding the desperation of their situation even
    better than he did, knowing, too, that a stranger could,
    indeed, scarce conceive the deadly peril of it, was, at first,
    the cooler of the two. Her life there in the mountains, where
    any man she knew might meet, and her own father had met, death
    stalking with a rifle in his bended elbow, or a knife clutched
    in his clenched hand, had given her a certain poise in time of
    peril, an admirable self-control, quick wits, firm nerves. She
    felt that there was small chance of escape, yet she was not
    visibly terrified, and made no outcry.</p>

    <p>Had she been caught, thus, with a mountaineer (which
    scarcely could have happened) she would have felt small
    apprehension. Learned in the perils of the woods, heavy-booted,
    sturdy-legged, a native, like Joe Lorey, for example, would,
    she felt quite certain, have been able to effect her rescue.
    But the chances, she decided, were practically nil, with this
    untrained "foreigner" as her companion. She had been told that
    "bluegrass folks" were lacking in strong nerves and prone to
    panic if real danger threatened. Barefooted as she was, there
    was little she, herself, could do. She knew that she would
    quickly fall unconscious from intolerable pain if she so much
    as tried to make a dash for safety. That she was badly
    frightened she would have readily admitted, that she was
    panic-stricken none who looked at her could, for a moment,
    dream.</p>

    <p>She glanced at Layson with a curiosity which was almost
    calm, as, for a moment quite bewildered, he ran from side to
    side of their rapidly narrowing space of safety, endeavoring to
    find a weak spot in the wall of flames through which they might
    escape, but failing everywhere. For a moment she thought that
    he had lost his head, and thus proved all too true those tales
    which she had heard of "foreigners." It was almost as one race
    gazing at another suffering ordeal in test, that she observed
    his every movement, each detail of his facial play. While they
    had sat there on the log, intent upon their work above her
    spelling-book, she had wondered if the harsh, uncharitable
    mountain judgment of the "foreigners" had not been too
    merciless. Now she felt that she began to see its
    justification. The man, undoubtedly, she thought, showed an
    unmanly panic.</p>

    <p>"No use tryin' to get out that-a-way," she said calmly.
    "You'd better&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Even as she spoke, and before her words could possibly have
    influenced him, she saw a change come over him. The signs of
    fear, which had so displeased her, faded from his actions and
    his facial play. Placed in unusual, unexpected circumstances,
    for a second he had been bewildered, but, as soon as
    opportunity had come for gathering of wits, he found composure,
    coolness, nerve. She did not even finish out her sentence.
    Instead, her thoughts turned to that acme of breeding, nerve,
    endurance and high spirit dear to all Kentuckians, the race
    horse. "He's found his feet!" she thought.</p>

    <p>The man impressed her, now, even more than when, with
    courtesy, such as she had never known, tact which had
    maintained her comfort when she might have felt humiliated,
    learning which to her seemed marvellous, he had offered her the
    key to learning's mysteries upon the log. She saw that he had
    quickly won a mighty victory over self. She thought of tales
    which she had heard by mountain fireplaces about "bad men,"
    who, when they first had heard a bullet's song, had dodged and
    whitened, only to recover quickly and be nerved to peril
    evermore thereafter. Her doubt of Layson fell away completely.
    Instead of thinking of him as of one whose manhood is inferior
    to that of the rough mountaineers she knew, perforce she saw in
    him superiorities. There was not the least sign of bragadocio,
    of counterfeit, about his new-found calm. It was, she
    recognized at once, entirely genuine. "Rattled for a minute,"
    she thought, wisely, again amending her first judgment, "but
    cooler, now, than cucumbers."</p>

    <p>She looked gravely at him as he moved about investigating,
    not excitedly, alertly, full of the necessary business of
    escape. "Looks bad, don't it?" she said gravely. "Like powder,
    them thar pine-tops."</p>

    <p>"Oh, we'll get out all right," he answered, easily, and now
    she felt a comfort in the fact that he was intentionally
    minimizing danger to give confidence to the supposed weakness
    of her sex.</p>

    <p>"Maybe so an' maybe not," said she, discovering, to her
    disgust, that it was hard, now that he was showing strength, to
    keep the panic tremolo from her own voice.</p>

    <p>The fire had, by this time, encircled them completely, and
    from a hundred points was running in toward them on tinder
    lines of dry pine-needles and old leaves, flashing at them
    viciously along the crisp, dry surface of old moss and lichens
    on the rocks. A wind had suddenly arisen, born, no doubt, of
    the fire's own mighty draft. Bits of blazing light wood, small,
    burning branches, myriads of flaming oak leaves and pine-cones
    were swept up from the ring of fire about them, in the chimney
    of the blaze, to lose their impetus only at a mighty height,
    and then fall slowly, threateningly down within the burning
    ring. So plentiful were these little, vicious menaces, that,
    within another minute, they were dodging them continually.</p>

    <p>He now took his place close by her side and gazed upon the
    spectacle, calm-eyed, as if he found it interesting rather more
    than terrifying.</p>

    <p>"Oh, we'll get out, all right," said he, again.</p>

    <p>And then he turned to her in frank and unexcited inquiry. To
    her increased disgust the sobs of growing fear convulsed her
    throat. She fought them back and listened to his question.</p>

    <p>"You know more about woods-fires than I do," he said evenly.
    "Better tell me what to do, eh?"</p>

    <p>This confession of his ignorance strengthened her growing
    confidence in him instead of weakening it. The fact that he
    could ask advice so calmly made her think that, probably, he
    would be calm in taking it if she could offer it. It steadied
    her and helped her think. And then she saw him spring, and,
    actually with a smile, strike in the air above her head,
    diverting from its downward path which would have landed it
    upon her, a flaming fragment of pine-top fully five feet long.
    He actually laughed.</p>

    <p>"Like handball," he said cheerily. "Don't worry. I won't let
    anything fall on you. You just&mdash;<i>think!</i>"</p>

    <p>Her panic, now, had vanished as by magic. Instantly she
    really <i>ceased</i> to worry. He would <i>not</i> let fire
    fall on her. He would get her out of that. She was certain of
    it. She <i>could</i> think&mdash;calmly and with care.</p>

    <p>But she could not think of a way out&mdash;at least she
    could not think of a way out for her. Barefooted as she was,
    she scarcely could expect to find, even in her strong young
    body, strength enough to endure the pain of treading, as she
    would be forced to if she made a dash, on an almost unbroken
    bed of glowing coals and smouldering moss ten yards in width.
    He, with his heavy boots, might manage it. Therefore there was
    hope for him; but for her to try it would be madness.</p>

    <p>Had he been a sturdy mountaineer, she wofully
    reflected&mdash;having found a detail of lowland inferiority
    which, she was quite certain, would not be dispelled as had
    some others&mdash;he might, in such a desperate case, have
    summoned strength to "tote" her through, although she scarcely
    thought Joe Lorey, the best man whom she knew, could really do
    it; still there would have been the possibility. But no
    weak-muscled "foreigner," pap-nurtured in the lowlands, could,
    she knew, of course, accomplish such a feat. It was fine to
    know things, as he did, but <i>muscle</i> was what counted now!
    In queer, impersonal reflection, born, doubtless, of a dumb
    hysteria, she reflected bitterly upon the healthy weight of her
    own mountain-nourished person.</p>

    <p>"If I was only like them triflin' bluegrass gals Joe tells
    about," she thought, "made up of nothin' or a little less, it
    wouldn't be no trick to tote me outen this; but dellaw! I'm
    just as much as that there ox of mine feels right to carry when
    I got a couple bags o' grist on, back an' front."</p>

    <p>She looked around the ring of fire, dull-eyed, disheartened.
    "Ain't no use," said she, aloud.</p>

    <p>He seemed to almost lose his temper. "Use?" said he, "of
    course there's use! You tell me where the best chance is and
    we'll fight out, all right."</p>

    <p>She did not even answer; the situation seemed to her so
    wholly hopeless.</p>

    <p>He acted, then, without further question. Hastily throwing
    the loop of his gun over his shoulder, he crooked one arm
    beneath her much-astonished knees, clasped another tight about
    her waist, and started for the fire with a determined
    spring.</p>

    <p>"No, no; not there!" she screamed, astonished, terrified,
    and yet, withal, delighted by the unexpected hardness of the
    muscles in the arms which held her, the unexpected spring in
    the apparently not overburdened limbs which bore them up, the
    unexpected nerve, determination of the man's initiative.</p>

    <p>This "foreigner," it seemed, was not so weak, was not so
    namby-pamby as his class had been described to be. She did not
    struggle in the circling arms, she only made an
    explanation.</p>

    <p>"That's hard wood, burnin' there," said she. "Burnin' hard
    wood's harder to break through an' hotter, too. Try some place
    where it's pine.... But you can't never do it!"</p>

    <p>"Where?" said he. "Show me! You know, I don't."</p>

    <p>"Well&mdash;over thar," she said, and indicated, with a
    pointing hand, the place in the encircling conflagration where
    passage seemed least hopeless.</p>

    <p>At that moment fire blazed high there, but her knowing eye
    told her that it was largely flaring needles, brittle twigs,
    and easily dissipated cones which fed it.</p>

    <p>A few great springs, such as she now felt that the
    quivering, eager limbs which held her, were possessed of the
    ability to make, might take them through this flimsiest spot in
    the terrible barricade. The crackling, burning branches of the
    dead pine-tops would be likely to give way before them, not to
    trip them up, as oak would, to thrust them, falling, on the bed
    of glowing coals fast forming on the ground.</p>

    <p>"Over thar," said she, again. "I reckon that's the best
    place&mdash;but you cain't&mdash;"</p>

    <p>With the new respect the knowledge of his trained and ready
    muscles brought to her, arose in her a towering admiration of
    him. When she first had seen him, there beside the pool, she
    definitely had liked him; while they had delved into the
    mysteries of the alphabet upon the log his patient, willing,
    helpful kindness had increased her prepossession in his favor.
    It was only when, after disaster had so swiftly, so
    unexpectedly, descended on them and she had compared his body,
    made apparently more slender in comparison to the rude-limbed
    mountaineers she knew than it was really by tight-fitting
    knickerbockers and golf-stockings and its well-cut
    shooting-jacket, that she had lost confidence in him. But now
    his muscles, closing round her, seemed like thews of steel. She
    had never heard of athletes, she did not dream that
    muscle-building is a part of modern education&mdash;that
    alertness on the baseball, polo, football fields, count quite
    as much, at least in college popularity, as ready tongues and
    agile wits. The last fibres of destroyed respect for him
    rebuilt themselves upon the minute. Her confidence returned
    completely in a sudden flash&mdash;quicker than the magic
    leapings of the fire about them. She knew that he would take
    her through to safety.</p>

    <p>A thought occurred to her, for, suddenly, with the new
    respect for him the knowledge of his trained and ready muscles
    gave her, arose a new consideration for him, almost motherly.
    He would be breasting dreadful peril in the passage of the
    flames&mdash;peril to his eyes and face and clinging,
    tight-clasped hands especially. And round her limbs there was
    the means of saving him, in part, from it.</p>

    <p>"You let me down for just a minute," she said briefly. "Just
    a minute. Then I'll let you take me up an' carry me. An' you
    can <i>do</i> it, too! You're strong, ain't you?"</p>

    <p>Wondering, he released his hold on her, and she slid to her
    feet. Then, with a quick movement, she unbuttoned the waistband
    of her outer skirt, and, letting it slip down to the ground,
    stepped out of it.</p>

    <p>"Ain't it lucky I got wet?" said she, and smiled. "It ain't
    more'n half dry yet. The under one is wet, too, and both of 'em
    are wool&mdash;and that don't burn like cotton would.</p>

    <p>"Now pick me up again an' I'll just fix this
    skirt&mdash;so&mdash;there&mdash;now&mdash;that's the way. Can
    you see, now? All right? Well, it'll keep th' fire from
    catchin' in our hair, an' it'll save your
          eyes."</p><a name="Illus_2"></a> <br>

        <h4>A mighty leap had carried them beyond the blazing
        barrier</h4>
    </center><br>
     <br>
    <br>


    <p>He laughed. "That's fine!" said he, and, almost before she
    realized that they were under way, a mighty leap had taken them
    close to the blazing barrier, another one had landed them
    within its very midst, another one had carried them beyond its
    greatest menace, another had delivered them from actual peril,
    leaving them on ground where filmy grass, dead leaves, dry
    needles, had blazed quickly, with a consuming flash, and,
    utterly and almost instantly destroyed, had left behind them
    only thin, hot ash, devoid of peril, scarce to be
    considered.</p>

    <p>But he did not let her feet touch ground again until they
    were even beyond this. Finally, when they reached a rocky
    "barren," where the little fire had found no fuel, she felt his
    tautened thews relax.</p>

    <p>Instantly she slipped from his encircling arms, and he began
    to whip the flames in grass and little brush close to them with
    the dampened skirt. Even on the little isle of safety they
    found it necessary, still, to agilely avoid innumerable bits of
    floating "light-wood" brands, and, for a time, to beat, beat at
    the hungry little flames around them, but, at last, the danger
    was all over, and they stood there, looking at each other, with
    a sense of great relief. He smiled, breathing hard, but not
    exhausted.</p>

    <p>"Tight work, eh?" he said cheerfully.</p>

    <p>"Jest <i>wonderful</i>!" she answered, with a ready
    tribute.</p>

    <p>Then the memory of his embracing arm, the fact that her own
    arms had been as tightly clasped about his neck, came to her
    with a rush, although, while they had raced across the burning
    strip she had not thought of these things. Shyness stirred in
    her almost as definitely as it had while she lay hidden at the
    pool's mouth, watching him and tingling with shamed thrills at
    thought of her amazing plight there. No man had ever had his
    arms about her in her life before.</p>

    <p>But, even while she blushed and thrilled with this
    embarrassment, she fought to put it from her. He, evidently,
    had not thought of it at all, was, now, not thinking of it.
    What had been done had been a part of the day's work, a quick
    move, made in an emergency, when nothing else would serve. His
    attitude restored her own composure.</p>

    <p>And gratitude welled in her. She struggled to find words for
    it.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I'm much obleeged to you," were all she found, and
    she was conscious of their most complete inadequacy.</p>

    <p>"No reason why you should be," he said gayly. "We got caught
    in a tight place, that's all, and we helped one another out of
    it."</p>

    <p>She laughed derisively. "I helped <i>you</i> out a lot, now
    didn't I?" she asked.</p>

    <p>Again she made a survey of him, standing where he had been
    when he had loosed his hold of her, unwearied, smiling, and she
    looked with actual wonder. Good clothes and careful speech were
    not, of a necessity, the outward signs of weaklings, it
    appeared!</p>

    <p>Joe Lorey, in a dozen talks with her, had told her that they
    were. She did not understand that this had been a clumsy and
    short-sighted strategy, that, finding her more difficult than
    other mountain girls&mdash;the handsome, sturdy young
    hill-dweller had not been without his conquests among the
    maidens of his kind; only Madge had baffled him&mdash;he had
    feared that, now when the railroad building in the valley had
    brought so many "foreigners" into the neighborhood, one of them
    might fascinate her, and it had been to guard against this, as
    well as he was able, that he had spoken slightingly of the
    whole class. He had delighted in repeating to her tales
    belittling them, deriding them, and she, of course, had quite
    believed his stories.</p>

    <p>But her experience with this one had not justified that
    point of view, and the matter largely occupied her thoughts as
    they walked slowly through the thickets of a bit of
    "second-growth" beyond the fire, which, stopped by the rocky
    "barrens," was dying out behind them. Her companion was, to
    her, an utterly new sort of being, not better trained in mind
    alone, but better trained in body than any mountaineer she
    knew; doubtless ignorant of many details of woods-life which
    would be known to any child there in the mountains, but, on the
    other hand, even more resourceful, daring, quick, than mountain
    men would have been, similarly placed, and, to her amazement,
    physically stronger, too!</p>

    <p>The fact that he had shown himself more thoughtful of and
    courteous to her than any other man had ever been before, made
    its impression, but a slighter one. Hers were the instincts of
    true wisdom, and she valued these things less than many of her
    city sisters might, although she valued them, of course. She
    looked slyly, wonderingly at him. He was a very pleasant, very
    admirable sort of creature&mdash;this visitor from the unknown,
    outside world. She quite decided that she did not even think
    his knickerbockers foolish, after all.</p>

    <p>For a moment, even now, she thrilled unpleasantly with a
    mean suspicion that he might be a "revenuer," after all, and
    have done the good things he had done as a part of that
    infernal craft which revenuers sometimes showed when searching
    for the hidden stills where "moonshine" whisky is illegally
    produced among the mountains; but she put this thought out of
    her heart, indignantly, almost as quickly as it came to her.
    Instinctively she felt quite certain that duplicity did not
    form any portion of his nature. They had not been traitor's
    arms which had so bravely (and so firmly) clasped her for the
    quick and risky dash across that terrifying belt of fire!</p>

    <p>"No," said she, determined to give him fullest measure of
    due credit, "I didn't help you none. I didn't help you
    none&mdash;an' you did what I don't believe any other man I
    ever knew could do. I'm&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Again she paused, again at loss for words, again the quest
    failed wholly.</p>

    <p>"I'm much obleeged," said she.</p>

    <p>Then, suddenly, the thought came to her of that other and
    less prepossessing "foreigner" whom, that day, she had seen
    there in her mountains. She described him carefully to Layson,
    and asked if he could guess who he had been and what his
    business could have been. Descriptions are a sorry basis for
    the recognition of a person thought to be far miles away, a
    person unassociated in one's mind with the surroundings he has
    suddenly appeared in; and, therefore, Layson, who really knew
    the man and who, had he identified him with the unknown
    visitor, would have been surprised, intensely curious, and,
    possibly, suspicious, could offer her no clue to his
    identity.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER IV</h2><br>


    <p>That same "foreigner," for a "foreigner," was acting
    strangely. Surely he was dressed in a garb hitherto almost
    unknown in the rough mountains, certainly none of the
    mountaineers whom he had met (and he had met, with plain
    unwillingness, a few, as he had climbed up to the rocky
    clearing where his fire had blossomed so remarkably) had
    recognized him. But, despite all this, it was quite plain that
    he was traveling through a country of which he found many
    details familiar. Now and then a little vista caught his view
    and held him for long minutes while he seemed to be comparing
    its reality with pictures of it stored within his memory; again
    he paused when he discovered that some whim of tramping
    mountaineers or roaming cattle, some landslide born of winter
    frosts; some blockade of trees storm-felled, had changed the
    course of an old path. Always, in a case like this, he
    investigated carefully before he definitely started on the new
    one.</p>

    <p>When he had first come into the neighborhood he had made his
    way with caution, almost as if fearing to be seen, but now,
    after the bits of rocks which he had taken from Madge Brierly's
    clearing, had slipped into his pocket, he used double care in
    keeping from such routes as showed the marks of many recent
    footsteps, in sly investigations to make sure the paths he
    chose were clear of other wayfarers. His nerves evidently on
    keen edge, he seemed to fear surprise of some unpleasant sort.
    Each crackling twig, as he passed through the thickets, each
    rustling of a frightened rabbit as it scuttled from his path,
    each whir of startled grouse, or sudden call of nesting
    king-bird, made him pause cautiously until he had quite
    satisfied himself that it meant nothing to be feared. He was
    ever carefully alert for danger of some sort.</p>

    <p>But not even his continual alarms, his constant
    watchfulness, could keep his mind away from the rough bits of
    rock which he had chipped from the outcropping in the clearing.
    More than once, as he found convenient and safe
    places&mdash;leafy nooks in rocky clefts, glades in dense,
    impenetrable thickets&mdash;he took out the little specimens,
    turned them over in his hands with loving touches, and gazed at
    them with an expression of picturesquely avaricious joy. Had
    any witnessed this procedure they would have found it vastly
    puzzling, for the specimens seemed merely small, black stones
    and valueless. But once, while looking at them lovingly, he
    burst into a harsh and hearty laugh as of great triumph, quite
    involuntarily; but hushed it quickly, looking, then, about him
    with an apprehensive glance. Each step he made was, in the
    main, a cautious one, each pause he made was plainly to look at
    some familiar, if some slightly altered, vista.</p>

    <p>It was quite clear that with the finding of the little bits
    of rock he had achieved the errand which had brought him to the
    mountains, and that now he roamed to satisfy his memory's
    curiosity. Smiles of recognition constantly played upon his
    grim and grizzled face at sight of some old path, some distant,
    mist-enshrouded crag, even some mighty pine or oak which had
    for years withstood the buffeting of tempestuous storms; now
    and then a little puzzled frown, added its wrinkles to the many
    which already creased his brow, when, at some spot which he had
    thought to find as he had left it, long ago, he discovered that
    time's changes had been notable.</p>

    <p>Once only did the man become confused among the woods-paths
    (where a stranger might have lost himself quite hopelessly in
    twenty minutes) and that was at a point not far from where
    Madge Brierly and Layson had, on their way up from the
    clearing, paused while she told her youthful escort of the grim
    but simple tragedy of her feud-darkened childhood. Before the
    old man reached this spot he had been traveling with puzzled
    caution, for a time, across a slope rough-scarred by some not
    ancient landslide which had changed the superficial contour of
    the mountain-side. When, suddenly, he debouched upon the rocky
    crag, hung, a rustic, natural platform above a gorgeous
    panorama of the valley, the view came to him, evidently, as a
    sharp, a startling, most unpleasant shock.</p>

    <p>That the place was quite familiar to him none who watched
    him would have doubted, but no smiles of pleasant memories
    curved his thin, unpleasant lips as he surveyed it. He did not
    pause there, happily, communing with his memory in smiling
    reminiscence as he had at other points along the way. Instead,
    as the great view burst upon his gaze, he started back as if
    the outlook almost terrified him. He had been traveling astoop,
    partly because the burden of his years weighed heavy on his
    shoulders, partly as if his muscles had unconsciously reverted
    to the easy, slouching, climbing-stoop of the Kentucky
    mountaineer. But at sight of this especial spot his attitude
    changed utterly, the whole expression, not of his face, alone,
    but of his body, altered. His stoop became a crouch. His hands
    flew out before him as if, with them, he strove to ward away
    the charming scene. His feet paused in their tracks, as if
    struck helpless and immovable by what his eyes revealed to
    him.</p>

    <p>For a full moment, almost without moving, he stood there,
    fascinated by some old association, plainly, for there was
    nothing in the prospect which, to an actual stranger, would
    have seemed more notable than details of a dozen other views
    which he had peered at through his half-closed, weather-beaten
    eyes within the hour. Here, clearly, was the arena of some
    great event in his past life&mdash;an arena which he gladly
    would have never seen again. His face went pale beneath its
    coat of tan, his shoulders trembled slightly as he tried to
    shrug them with indifference to brace his courage up. Twice he
    started from the spot, determined, evidently, to shut away the
    crowding and unpleasant recollections it recalled to him, twice
    he returned to it, to carefully, if with evident repugnance,
    make closer study of some detail of its rugged picturesqueness.
    More than once, as he lingered there against his will, his
    hands raised upward to his eyes as if to shut away from them
    some vivid memory-picture, but each time they fell, with
    strangely hopeless gesture. The picture which they strove to
    hide plainly was not before his eyes in the actual scene, but
    painted in the brain behind them and not to be shut out with
    screening, claw-curved fingers.</p>

    <p>The effect of this especial spot on the old man, indeed, was
    most remarkable. His lips, as he stood gazing there, moved
    constantly as if with words unspoken, and, once or twice, the
    crowding sentences found actual but not articulate voice.
    Whenever this occurred he started, to look about behind him as
    if he feared that some one, who might overhear, had crept up
    upon him slyly. Finally, making absolutely certain that he had
    not been observed by any human being, and evidently yielding to
    an impulse almost irresistible, he went over the ground
    carefully, examining each foot of the little rocky platform
    with not a loving, but a fascinated observation.</p>

    <p>When he finally left the spot a striking change had come
    upon his features. He had reached the place sly, cunning, and,
    withal, triumphant, as if he had accomplished, that day,
    through securing the small stones, some secret thing of a great
    import. His countenance, as, at length, he went away, was not
    triumphant but half terrified. It was as if some long-forgotten
    scene of horror had been brought before his gaze again, to
    terrify and astonish him.</p>

    <p>His footsteps had been slow and leisurely, the footsteps of
    a contemplative, if a surreptitious sightseer, but now they
    quickened almost into running, and the intensely disagreeable
    effect of the mysterious episode had not left him wholly, when,
    twenty minutes afterward, he had mounted the rocky hill path by
    a precipitous climb and found himself within a little, cupped
    inclosure in the rocks, secluded enough and beautiful enough to
    be a fairies' dancing-floor. There, again, he seemed to
    recognize old landmarks, but with fewer of unpleasant memories
    connected with them. Plain curiosity glowed, now, in his
    narrow, crafty eyes.</p>

    <p>"I wonder," he exclaimed, "if it's here yet."</p>

    <p>As he spoke his glance flashed swiftly to the far side of
    the little glade, where, on the face of a dense thicket, a
    trained eye, such as his, might mark a spot where bushes had
    been often parted with extreme care not to do them injury and
    thus reveal the fact that through them lay a thoroughfare.
    Noting this with a wry smile of malicious satisfaction, he
    started slowly toward the spot.</p>

    <p>The caution of his movements was redoubled, now. While he
    had worked, back in the clearing, cooking his simple noonday
    meal and chipping off the little specimens of rock, he had
    shown that he wished not to have his strange activities
    observed. On the mountain paths he had plainly been most
    anxious not to run across chance wayfarers who might ask
    questions, or (the possibility was most remote, but still a
    possibility) remember him of old. He had been merely cautious,
    though, not definitely fearful.</p>

    <p>Now, however, actual and obsessive dread showed plainly on
    his face and in his movements. Such a fear would have induced
    most men to abandon any enterprise which was not fraught with
    compelling necessity; with him insistent curiosity seemed to
    counterbalance it. The man's face, rough, hard, cruel, was,
    withal, unusually expressive; its deep lines were more than
    ordinarily mobile, and every one of them, as he proceeded,
    soft-footed as a cat, amazingly lithe and supple for his years,
    as competent to find his way unseen through a woods country as
    an Indian, showed that irresistible and fiercely inquisitive
    impulse was offsetting in his mind a deadly apprehension.</p>

    <p>In one way only, though, in spite of the accelleration of
    his eager curiosity, did he drop his guard, at all, and this
    was quite apparently the direct result of high excitement. That
    he had dropped it he was clearly quite unconscious, but when
    his lips moved, now, they more than once let fall articulate
    words.</p>

    <p>"Ef th' old still's thar ..." they said at one time; then,
    after a long pause devoted to worming troublous way through
    tangled areas of windfall, they muttered, in completion of the
    sentence: "... it'll be th' son that's runnin' it." Another
    busy silence, and: "Thar was a girl ... th' daughter
    of...."</p>

    <p>Either a spasmodic contraction of the throat at mere thought
    of the name&mdash;a grimace, almost of pain, which suddenly
    convulsed the old man's evil face might well have made a
    stranger think that his muscles had rebelled&mdash;or an
    unusually difficult struggle across a fallen tree-trunk
    prevented further speech, as, probably, it prevented for the
    time, consecutive further thought of old-time memories. His
    mind was tensely concentrated on the work of climbing through
    the tangle of dead trunks and branches, and, when he had
    accomplished the hard passage, was turned wholly from the
    things which he had been considering by a slight crackling, as
    of some one stepping on a brittle twig, at a distance in
    advance of him.</p>

    <p>Instantly he was on his guard, showing signs quite
    unmistakable of deadly fear. He shrank back into the thicket
    with the speed and silence of a frightened animal.</p>

    <p>The panic which had seized him soon had passed, however,
    for, within a few short seconds it was clear to him that the
    noise which he had heard had not been made by any one
    suspicious of his presence or a-search for him.</p>

    <p>Peering cautiously between the slender boles of crooked
    mountain-laurel bushes, he soon found a vantage point from
    which he could see on beyond the densely woven foliage, and, to
    his astonishment, found, before he had thought, possible that
    he had progressed so far, that he had already reached the place
    he sought. Memory had made the way to it a longer one than it
    was really, and, in spite of the delays caused by his advancing
    age and awkward muscles, long unaccustomed to the work of
    threading mountain paths, he had traveled faster than he
    thought.</p>

    <p>Not fifty feet away from him, separated from the thicket he
    was hiding in but by a narrow stretch of mountain sward, he
    saw, among the mountain side's disordered rocks, the carefully
    masked entrance to a cave.</p>

    <p>An untrained eye would never have made note of the few signs
    which made it clear to him, at once, that this cave was, as it
    had been long years before when he had known it well, a place
    of frequent call for footsteps skilled in mountain cunning. No
    path was worn to its rough entrance, but, here and there, a
    broken grass-blade, in another place a pebble recently
    dislodged from its accustomed hollow, elsewhere a ragged bit of
    paper, torn from a tobacco-package, proved to him that,
    although hidden in the wilderness of old Mount Nebo's scarred
    and inaccessible sides, this spot was yet one often visited by
    many men.</p>

    <p>A grim smile stirred the leathern folds of his old
    cheeks.</p>

    <p>"Thar yet," he thought, "an' doin' business yet."</p>

    <p>Again, after he had worked about to get a better view.</p>

    <p>"Best-hidden still in these here mountings. Revenuers never
    <i>will</i> get run of it."</p>

    <p>The place had a mighty fascination for him, as if it might
    have played a tremendous part in long-gone passages of his own
    life. As he stood gazing at it cautiously, the mountaineer
    seemed definitely to emerge from his low-country dress and
    superficial "bluegrass" manner, fastened on him by long years
    of usage. Old expressions of not only face but muscles came
    clearly to the front. Now, no person watching him, could ever
    for a moment doubt that he was mountain-born and mountain-bred,
    if they but knew the ear-marks of that people&mdash;almost a
    race apart. The sight of the old cave-mouth plainly stirred in
    him a horde of memories not wholly pleasant. Leathern as his
    face was, it none the less showed his emotions with remarkable
    lucidity now that he was off his guard. Now sly cunning
    dominated it, with, possibly, a touch left of the early fear to
    flavor it.</p>

    <p>"I bet a hundred revenuers in these mountains have looked
    for that there still," he thought, "an' no one ever found it,
    yet. Forty years it's been thar&mdash;through three generations
    o' th' Loreys&mdash;damn 'em!&mdash;an' no one's ever squealed
    on 'em. I ... wonder...."</p>

    <p>A look of vicious craft and malice wholly drove away the
    searching curiosity which had possessed the old man's features.
    For a time he plainly planned some work of bitter vengefulness.
    Then, with shaking head, he evidently abandoned the enticing
    thought.</p>

    <p>"Too resky," he concluded, and edged a little nearer to the
    thicket's edge. "Might stir up old&mdash;"</p>

    <p>He paused suddenly, alert and keenly listening. From another
    path than that by which he had approached the place there came
    the sound of voices raised in talk and laughter. He easily
    identified them, to his great surprise, as those of some young
    mountain-girl and some young bluegrass gentleman. Their tones
    and accents told this story plainly. Surprised and curious, he
    went farther, his head bent, with study of the voices, peering,
    meanwhile, through the thicket's tangle to get sight of them as
    soon as they appeared within the clearing. Suddenly he dropped
    his jaw in blank amazement.</p>

    <p>"Frank Layson!" he exclaimed.</p>

    <p>The girl's voice he did not recognize, but knew, of course,
    from its peculiar accent, that it was some mountain
    maiden's.</p>

    <p>"Well!" he exclaimed beneath his breath in absolute
    astonishment. "I didn't think it of Frank Layson! What would
    Barbara&mdash;"</p>

    <p>The pair emerged, now, from a gully by-path, and came into
    view. He tightly shut his jaws and watched them with a peering,
    eager curiosity.</p>

    <p>A moment later, and by her wonderful resemblance to her dead
    mother, he recognized the girl.</p>

    <p>She, above all people, must not know that he was there, even
    if she only thought him to be Horace Holton, newcomer among the
    bluegrass gentry in the valley. His plans had been laid
    carefully, and for her to find them out would almost certainly
    upset them all. He was far from anxious to meet Layson, there
    among the mountains, for it would mean awkward questioning, but
    he was doubly anxious to avoid a meeting with the girl, first
    because she owned the land on which he had secured the bits of
    rock then nestling in his pocket, and, second, because she was
    the daughter of&mdash;</p>

    <p>His thoughts were interrupted, for, for a second, he thought
    they must have seen him, so definite was their approach
    straight toward the thicket where he hid. He crouched,
    frightened. It would be a very awkward matter to be found there
    by them, and, besides, he did not know who might be out of
    sight within the hidden still. It was quite possible that there
    might lurk a deadly enemy. He must worm back through the
    thicket with great caution, and, following the secluded ways
    which he had traversed in his coming, get back to the railroad
    camp, where was safety.</p>

    <p>He stepped backward hastily, and, in so doing, trod upon a
    rotten branch. He had not been as cautious as he had intended,
    and this mis-step unbalanced him and sent him to the ground,
    with a tremendous crashing of the brittle twigs and
    dead-wood.</p>

    <p>Springing to his feet while the young people, startled by
    the great disturbance, paused where they were standing, for an
    instant, he hurried back into the hidden, thicket-bordered
    path, now using all his recrudescent skill of silent
    woods-progression, and made complete escape, leaving them not
    sure that the disturbance had been caused by human blundering
    and not some vagrant beast's.</p>

    <p>Madge held back, but Layson hurried to the thicket, with gun
    raised ready for a shot.</p>

    <p>Just then, from the carefully concealed cave-entrance, came
    Joe Lorey, rifle poised for trouble, eyes gleaming fiercely,
    evidently keyed to meet a raid by revenuers.</p>

    <p>It was plain enough that he believed the noise which had
    disturbed, alarmed him, had been made by this young sportsman.
    Indeed, as he who really had caused the uproar was, now, well
    on a cautious backward way along the path by which he had come
    up, and the girl and Layson were the only folk in sight, the
    young moonshiner's mistake was natural.</p>

    <p>Madge, almost as much disturbed as Lorey was by the crashing
    in the thickets, was looking in the direction whence the noise
    had come, and, at first, did not see him. When she did she
    smiled at him, and called to him, but, absorbed in study of the
    bluegrass youth who had so suddenly appeared there in his
    secret place among the mountains in company with the girl whom
    he, himself, adored, Joe did not answer her, at first. When he
    did it was with nothing more than a curt nod. He was astonished
    and alarmed to see her in such company.</p>

    <p>After that curt nod he waited for no explanation, but, like
    a shadow, slipped into a thicket, disappearing instantly. No
    Indian from Cooper's tales could have more instantly
    obliterated all trace of himself, could have more quickly,
    noiselessly, mysteriously disappeared amongst the greenery,
    than did this mountaineer. His movements, made with the
    instinctive cunning of the woodsman and with muscles trained
    not only by wild life there in the mountains to speed,
    endurance and exactitude, but by many an hour of stealthy
    stalking of the "revenuers" sent to search out his moonshine
    still, raid it, take him prisoner, were almost magically
    active, cautious, furtive and effective.</p>

    <p>For an instant Madge herself, accustomed to the native's
    skill in woodcraft, as she was, gazed after him, astonished by
    the magic of his disappearance, and, at first, piqued not a
    little by his scanty courtesy. Then realizing that the
    mountaineer was, possibly, quite justified in feeling grave
    suspicions of the stranger who was with her&mdash;of any
    stranger coming thus, without a herald to the
    mountains&mdash;she turned again to Layson, and, with her hand
    lightly guiding him by touch as delicate, almost, as a
    wind-blown leaf's upon his sleeve, led him to the nearest
    mountain path and on, toward a point whence she could clearly
    point out to him the way to his own camp.</p>

    <p>And, suddenly, her own heart throbbed with worry. Had she
    not done wrong in bringing this unknown and, therefore, this
    mysterious stranger so close upon the heart of Lorey's secret?
    She had chosen the path thoughtlessly. She realized that, now,
    and much regretted it. The man had wholly won her confidence,
    but had it been considerate or fair to Joe, her lifelong
    friend, or to the other people of the mountains who had things
    to hide from strangers, to be quite so frank with him in her
    revelation of the byways of the wilderness?</p>

    <p>Between the mountain-dwellers and the people of the lowlands
    never could exist real confidence or friendship. From her
    babyhood she had been taught to feel suspicion of all
    strangers: that was, indeed, first article in the creed of all
    folk mountain-born. Why had she so freely dropped her mantle of
    reserve before <i>this</i> stranger? That he had saved her from
    the bush-fire was excuse for her own gratitude, but was it
    valid reason for exposing her best friends to danger at his
    hands, if they proved treacherous? The revenuers, she had been
    informed, were men of devilish craft, unscrupulous cunning.
    Might not this youth with the fine clothes, the splendid
    manner, the great learning, the soft voice, the quick resource
    and the undoubted bravery, very well be one of them?</p>

    <p>She had once heard a mountain preacher draw a picture of the
    devil, which made him most attractive and in the same way that
    this youth was most attractive. Certain of the sympathies of
    his rough hearers, the man had painted Beelzebub with broad,
    rough, verbal strokes, as a bluegrass gentleman intent on the
    destruction of the honor, independence, liberty of
    mountaineers. The mountaineer has never and will never
    understand what right the government of state or nation has to
    interfere with whatsoe'er he does on his own land with his own
    corn in his own still. Just why he has no right to manufacture
    whiskey without paying taxes on the product he really fails to
    comprehend. He regards the "revenuer" as the representative of
    acute and cruel injustice and oppression. When he "draws a
    bead" on one he does it with no such thoughts as common
    murderers must know when they shoot down their enemies. He does
    not think such killings are crude murder, any more than he
    regards feud killings as assassinations.</p>

    <p>With such ideas Madge had been, to some extent, imbued. With
    feud feeling she was quite in sympathy&mdash;had not she lost
    her loved ones through its awful work? Could she ever have
    revenge on those who had thus bereaved her through any means
    save similar assassination?</p>

    <p>And certainly the revenuers were her enemies, for they were
    the foemen of her friends. If this young man should be a
    revenuer she might have done a harm incalculable by guiding him
    along the secret mountain byways which they had been
    travelling.</p>

    <p>Her heart was in her throat from worry, for an instant. Had
    she, whose very soul was fiercely loyal to the mountains and
    their people, been the one to show an enemy the way into their
    citadel? Had she, bound especially to Joe Lorey, not only by
    the ties of lifelong friendship but by that other comradeship
    which had grown out of mutual wrongs and mutual hatred of Ben
    Lindsay (not dimmed, a whit, by the mere fact that, terrified,
    he had, years ago fled from the mountains), done Joe the
    greatest wrong of all by leading this fine stranger to the very
    entrance of his hidden still? <i>Was</i> he a revenuer in
    disguise?</p>

    <p>The magnitude of her possible indiscretion filled her with
    alarm. That crashing in the bushes back of them might have been
    made by some associate of his, who had trailed them at a
    distance, ready to give assistance, if needs be, or, in case
    all things went right and the bolder man who had gone first and
    fallen into the great luck of an acquaintance with her had no
    need of help, to corroborate his observations, help him to
    scheme the way by which to make attack upon the still when the
    time for it should come.</p>

    <p>As she considered all these possibilities, quite reasonable
    to her suspicious mind, she shuddered.</p>

    <p>But then, as she went slowly down the mountain path beside
    the stranger she looked up and caught the frank calm glances of
    his eyes.</p>

    <p>Surely there was nothing of cowardice such as would fool a
    trusting girl into betrayal of her friends, in them; surely
    there was not the low craft of a spy in them; surely their
    clear and unexcited gaze was not that of a keen hunter,
    unscrupulously on the trail of human game, who has just learned
    through the innocent indiscretion of a girl who trusted him,
    the secret of its covert.</p>

    <p>As she looked at him she was convinced of two things, vastly
    comforting. One was that Layson had no knowledge of the still;
    that, untrained to mountain ways and unsuspicious, he had not
    even guessed at the secret of the little hidden place among the
    mountains. Another was&mdash;and this gave her, although she
    could have scarcely explained why, a greater comfort than the
    first had&mdash;that had he had that knowledge he would not
    have used it meanly.</p>

    <p>She thrilled pleasantly with the complete conviction that
    the man whom she had liked so much at first sight, the man who
    had shown such pluck in saving her from fire, the man who had
    exhibited such thoughtfulness and helpfulness in starting her
    upon the rocky path toward education, was true and fair and
    fine&mdash;was, in the curt language of the mountains,
    "decent."</p>

    <p>When she left him at the foot of the rough path which wound
    up to the cabin where she lived alone, she had quite recovered
    confidence in him. She eagerly assented to his suggestion that
    they meet again, the following day, for the continuation of her
    studies.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER V</h2><br>


    <p>Their next lesson was in a new school-room. The clearing
    where they had had their first, was, now, charred and
    blackened, not attractive, after the small fire; so, after
    going to it, the following day to look it over with that
    interest with which the man who has escaped from peril seeks
    again, the scene of it in curiosity, they found another glade
    wherein to carry on their delving after knowledge of the
    ABC's.</p>

    <p>There, beneath a canopy of arching branches and the sky,
    between rustling walls of greenery pillared by the mighty boles
    of forest trees, they had the second lesson of the course which
    was to open up to Madge the magic realm of books and of the
    learning hidden in them.</p>

    <p>Nor did her investigations now, confine themselves, entirely
    to the things the small book taught. She questioned Layson
    about a thousand things less dry and matter-of-fact than shape
    of printed symbols and the manner of their combination in the
    printed word. Life, life&mdash;that was to her, as it has ever
    been to all of us, the most fascinating thing. Here was one who
    had come from far, mysterious realms which she had vaguely
    heard about in winter-evening gossip at the mountain-cabin
    firesides; realms where men were courteous to women, careful in
    their speech; where women did not work, but sat on silken
    chairs with black menials ready to their call to serve their
    slightest wish; where maidens were not clad as she was clad,
    and every woman she had ever known was clad, in calico or
    linsey-woolsey homespun, but richly, wondrously, in silks and
    satins, laces, beaded gew-gaws. In her imagination's picture,
    the maids and matrons of the bluegrass were as marvellous, as
    fascinating, as are the fairies and the sprites of Anderson and
    Grimm to girls more fortunately placed. No tale of elf born
    from a cleft rock, touched by magic wand, ever more completely
    fascinated any big-eyed city child, than did the tales which
    Layson told her&mdash;commonplace and ordinary to his mind:
    mere casual account of routine life&mdash;about his family and
    friends down in the bluegrass, the enchanted region separated
    from them where they sat by a hundred miles or so of rugged
    hills and billowing forests. Her eager questions especially
    drew from him with a greed insatiable account of all the
    gayeties of that mysterious existence.</p>

    <p>"And that aunt of yours&mdash;Muss
    Aluth&mdash;Aluth&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Miss Alathea Layson?" he inquired, and smiled.</p>

    <p>"Yes; what queer names the women have, down there! Is she
    pretty? Does <i>she</i> dress in silks and satins, too, like
    the girls that go to them big dances?"</p>

    <p>He laughed. "None of them are always dressed in silks and
    satins," he replied. "Perhaps I've given you a wrong idea. We
    work down there, as hard, perhaps, as you do here, but we have
    more things to work with. Don't get the notion, little girl,
    that all these things which I have told you of are magic things
    which surely will bring happiness! There is no more of that, I
    reckon, in the bluegrass than there is here in the mountains.
    Silks and satins don't make happiness, balls and garden-fetes
    don't make it. A girl who's sobbing in a ball gown can be quite
    as miserable as you would be, unhappy in your homespun."</p>

    <p>She was impatient of his moralizing. "I know that," she
    said. "Dellaw, don't you suppose I've got some sense? But it
    ain't <i>quite</i> true, neither. Maybe if I was going to be
    unhappy I'd be just as much so in a silk dress as I would in
    this here cotton one that I've got on; but I guess there's
    times when I'd be happier in the silk than I <i>would</i> be in
    this. My, I wisht I had one!"</p>

    <p>He looked at her appraisingly. She would, he thought, be
    wondrous beautiful if given the accessories which girls more
    fortunate had at their hand. Beautiful, she was, undoubtedly,
    without them; with them she would be&mdash;he almost caught his
    breath at thought of it&mdash;sensational!</p>

    <p>Mentally he ran over all the girls he knew in a swift survey
    of memory. Not one of them, he thought, could really compare
    with her. Even Barbara Holton, with her haughty, big featured,
    strikingly handsome face, although she had attracted him in
    days passed, seemed singularly unattractive to him, now.</p>

    <p>While he sat, musing thus, almost forgetful of the puzzling
    ABC, she gazed off across the valley dreamily, the ABC's as far
    from her. It was a lovely prospect of bare crag and wooded
    slope, green fields and low-hung clouds, with, at its center,
    here and there the silver of the stream which, back among the
    forest trees, supplied the water to the hidden pool where she
    had watched him, furtively, the first time she had ever seen
    him. But it was not of the fair prospect that the girl was
    thinking. The coming of the stranger had brought into her life
    a hundred new emotions, ten thousand puzzling guesses at the
    life which lay beyond and could produce such men as he. Were
    all men in the bluegrass like Frank Layson&mdash;courteous,
    considerate, and as strong and active as the best of
    mountaineers? If so&mdash;what a splendid place for women! She
    was sure that men like him were never brutal to their wives and
    daughters, sisters, mothers, as the mountaineers too often are;
    she was certain that they did not craze themselves with whisky
    and terrify and beat their families; she was sure that when one
    loved a girl the courtship must be all sweet gentleness and
    happiness and joy, not like the quick succession of mad
    love-making and fierce quarrels which had characterized the
    heart-affairs that she had watched, there in the mountains.</p>

    <p>She, herself, had had no love-affairs. Instinctively she had
    held herself aloof from the ruck of the young mountain-men,
    neither she nor they knew why, unless it was because she owned
    the valley land and so was what the mountain folk called rich.
    Most of them had tried to pay her court, but none of them, save
    Joe, had in the least attracted her, and she had let them know
    this (strangely) without arousing too much anger.</p>

    <p>Now she had one suitor, only, who was at all
    persistent&mdash;Joe. She had sometimes thought she loved him.
    Now she knew, quite certainly, that she did not, and, in a
    vague way, was sorry for him, for she was quite certain of his
    love for her. It never once occurred to her that she was
    rapidly falling in love with the young man by her side. She had
    not thought of him as being socially superior: the spirit of
    independence, of equality of men, is nowhere stronger, even in
    this land of independence and equality, than it is among the
    mountains of the Cumberland; but she knew he was most wise. Had
    not the puzzling symbols in the spelling-book been, to him, as
    simple matters? She knew that he was gentle-hearted, for the
    kindness of his acts proved that. She knew that he was, really,
    a gentleman, for his manner was so perfectly considerate, so
    ever kind. She did not realize that she was thinking of him as
    a lover; but she dreamed, there, of the girls down in the
    bluegrass and wondered how it must seem to them to have lovers
    such as he. She could but very vaguely speculate as to their
    emotions or appearance, but her speculations on both points,
    vague as they might be, made her suffer strangely and cast
    queer, furtive little side-glances at him. In her heart were
    stirrings of keen jealousy of these distant maidens, but this
    she did not realize.</p>

    <p>She broke into his revery with: "Don't you know any women,
    down there, but your aunt?"</p>

    <p>"Er&mdash;what?"</p>

    <p>"Don't you know any women, down there, but your aunt?"</p>

    <p>"Why, yes," said he, and laughed. "I know a lot of women,
    down there; lots and lots of women, certainly."</p>

    <p>"All them that go to balls, and such?"</p>

    <p>"Many of them."</p>

    <p>"Do you like to dance with them?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes; of course."</p>

    <p>"Tell me&mdash;all about the things they wear." This was not
    quite the question she had started out to ask, but an answer to
    it might be very interesting.</p>

    <p>She settled comfortably back upon the boulder she had chosen
    as a seat, her hands clasped about one knee, her face turned
    toward him eagerly, her eyes sparkling with keen zest.</p>

    <p>But he looked at her, appalled. "Why," said he, "why&mdash;I
    don't believe I can. I know they always seem to be most
    charming in appearance, but just how they work the magic
    <i>I</i> don't know."</p>

    <p>"Can't you tell me nothing?" Her voice showed bitter
    disappointment. She unclasped the hands about her knee and sat
    dejected on the boulder. She gave him not the slightest hint of
    it, but, suddenly, a plan had come into her mind.</p>

    <p>He looked at her regretfully. "Perhaps you'd better question
    me," said he. Maybe I can scare up details if you'll let me
    know just what you wish to hear about."</p>

    <p>"How are their dresses made?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"Oh, skirt, and waist, and so on," he airily replied.</p>

    <p>She made a gesture of impatience. "Well, then, how is the
    skirt made? Tell me that. Tell me everything that you remember
    about skirts. Are they loose as mine, or tighter?" She rose and
    stood before him, in her scant drapery of homespun, turning
    slowly, so that he might see.</p>

    <p>It was very clever. Instantly it brought to mind the last
    girls he had seen down in the lowlands at a lawn-party, with
    their wide and much beruffled skirts.</p>

    <p>"Oh, they're looser," he said gravely. "Much, much looser.
    Why, they are as big around as that!" He made a sweeping,
    circular gesture with his arms.</p>

    <p>"What for trimmings do they have?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, all sorts of things&mdash;ruffles, frills, embroidery
    and laces."</p>

    <p>"What's embroidery?"</p>

    <p>He tried to tell her, but he did not make it very clear,
    and, realizing that he had done quite his best although he had
    not done so very well, she sighed and dropped that detail of
    the subject. But she knew what frills and ruffles were.</p>

    <p>"And how about their waists?" said she. "Like mine, are
    they?"</p>

    <p>He looked, appraisingly, at the loose basque, which, because
    of the budding beauty of her form rather than because of any
    merit of its own, had seemed to him most charming and
    attractive. Close examination did not show this to be the case.
    It was a crude garment, certainly, of crude material, crude
    cut, crude make. The beauty all was in the wearer's soft young
    curves and lissome grace.</p>

    <p>"No," he answered, honestly, "they're not like that. In the
    summer, and for evenings&mdash;such as dances and the
    like&mdash;they are cut low at the neck. And they are
    tighter."</p>

    <p>"I suppose," said she, "they wear them things that they call
    corsets, under 'em. I've heard of 'em&mdash;I saw one,
    once&mdash;but I ain't never had one. Maybe I had better get
    one."</p>

    <p>He spoke hastily. At that moment, as he gazed at her slim
    grace, undulant, untrammelled and as willowy as a spring
    sapling's, it seemed to him that it would be a sacrilege to
    confine it in the stiff rigidity of such artificialities as
    corsets. It seemed a bit indelicate, to him, to talk to her
    about such matters, but her guilelessness was so real and he
    was so assured of his own innocence, that he did what he could
    to make things clear to her. He descanted with some eloquence
    upon the wickedness of lacing, the ungracefulness of artificial
    forms and the beauty of her own wholly natural grace.</p>

    <p>"I'm glad you think I'm pretty," she said frankly, plainly
    greatly pleased, "but I reckon I'd be prettier if I had one of
    them there corsets."</p>

    <p>His protests to the contrary were not convincing, in the
    least.</p>

    <p>So the lessons from the book did not go so very far that
    day.</p>

    <p>"Furbelows have always interested females, I suppose," said
    he, "but I didn't really think you'd lose your interest in
    spelling-books because of them."</p>

    <p>"I ain't lost interest in spelling-books," she said. "I
    ain't lost interest, at all. After I've studied good and hard I
    can read all about such things in the picture-papers that Mom
    Liza has down to the store. They've got all kinds of pictures
    in 'em&mdash;all of fancy gowns and hats and things like that.
    She showed one to me, once, but all I could make out was just
    the pictures, and she couldn't manage to make out much more.
    She can read the names on all the letters comin' to the
    post-office, for there's only three folks ever gets 'em, but
    she ain't what you'd really call a scholar."</p>

    <p>He laughed heartily. "So, even in the mountains, here, they
    take the fashion papers, do they?"</p>

    <p>"No; she don't pay for 'em," she gravely answered. "They're
    always marked with red ink, 'Sample Copy,' so she says; but
    they send 'em ev'ry once a while. If you're in th' post-office,
    you get a lot o' things, like that&mdash;all sorts o'
    picture-papers, an' cards, all printed up in pretty colors, to
    tell what medicines to take when you get sick."</p>

    <p>"Ah, patent-medicine advertisements."</p>

    <p>"Yes; that's what she calls 'em, an' she's read me some
    powerful amazin' stories out of 'em&mdash;them as was in short
    words&mdash;of folks that rose up almost from th' dead! They're
    wonderful!"</p>

    <p>"They are, indeed!"</p>

    <p>"But what I always liked th' best was them there papers
    tellin' about clo'es."</p>

    <p>"Eternal feminine!"</p>

    <p>"I don't know what you mean by that, but they are mighty
    peart, some o' them dresses pictured out in them there
    papers."</p>

    <p>"I've not the least doubt of it."</p>

    <p>"And I suppose they are th' kind th' girls you know, down in
    th' bluegrass, wear for ev'ry day!" she sighed.</p>

    <p>He looked at her in quick compassion and in protest.</p>

    <p>"Madge," he said, "please listen to me. It's not dress that
    makes the woman, any more than it is coats that make the man.
    You would like me just as well if I were dressed in homespun,
    wouldn't you?"</p>

    <p>"That's different."</p>

    <p>"It isn't; it's not, a bit."</p>

    <p>"Laws, yes! It's&mdash;oh&mdash;heaps different!" She nodded
    her lovely head in firm conviction. "It's heaps different and
    I'm goin' to know more about such things as clo'es. I ain't
    plumb <i>poverty</i> poor, like lots o' folks, here in th'
    mountings. I got land down in th' valley I get rent
    from&mdash;fifty dollars, every year! I'm goin' to find out
    about such things."</p>

    <p>He looked at her, almost worried. It would be a pity, he
    thought instantly, for this charming child of nature to become
    sophisticated and be fashionably gowned; but, of course, he
    made no protest.</p>

    <p>"You can learn a little something about such things if you
    stay right here," said he. "I'm going to have visitors,
    sometime before the summer's over, at my camp. My aunt, Miss
    Alathea, will be here, and our old friend, Colonel Sandusky
    Doolittle. He's a great horseman."</p>

    <p>Instantly the girl showed vivid interest, not, as he had
    thought she would, in his aunt, Miss Alathea, but in the
    Colonel from the Bluegrass, who also was a horseman.</p>

    <p>"Horseman, is he?" she exclaimed, her eyes alight.</p>

    <p>"Yes; he's famous as a judge of horses."</p>

    <p>"At them races that they tell about? Oh, I'd like to see one
    of them races!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, he goes to races, everywhere, although he always means
    to stop immediately after the next one. It has been the races
    which have kept him poor and kept him single."</p>

    <p>"How've they kept him poor?"</p>

    <p>He told her about betting, while she listened, wide-eyed
    with amazement at the mention of the sums involved.</p>

    <p>"How've they kept him single?"</p>

    <p>"He's been in love with my Aunt Alathea for a good many
    years, but she won't marry him until he keeps his promise to
    avoid the race-tracks."</p>

    <p>"What makes your aunt hate hawsses?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, she loves good horses, but the Colonel always bets,
    and, as I have said, it keeps him poor. It's the gambling that
    she hates, and not the horses. Every year he plans to keep away
    from all horse-racing for her sake; every year he tries to do
    it, but quite fails."</p>

    <p>She laughed heartily. "An' she thinks he loves th' races
    more than he does her?" she asked. Then, more soberly: "I don't
    know's I blame her, none. When's she comin'? I'll be powerful
    glad to see her."</p>

    <p>"I don't know just when she's coming, but she's promised me
    to have the Colonel bring her up here. I want to have her see
    the beauty of the mountains."</p>

    <p>"I'll like him, sure, whether I like her or not."</p>

    <p>He was astonished. "But you said you would be sure to love
    her!"</p>

    <p>"Uh-huh; but I'd be surer to like anyone who is as fond of
    hawsses as you say he is. Why, when I ride&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I didn't know you ever rode a horse. I've only seen you on
    your ox."</p>

    <p>"Poor old Buck! It's true, I have been ridin' him, when I
    felt lazy, lately, but my pony&mdash;ah, that's
    <i>fun</i>!"</p>

    <p>"Where is he?"</p>

    <p>They had started strolling down the trail and were near the
    pasture bars, where she had left Joe Lorey on the morning of
    her bath, after having ridden down to them upon her ox.</p>

    <p>She hurried to them, now, and, leaning over them, puckered
    her red lips and sent a shrill, clear whistle out across the
    pasture. Immediately from a thicket-tangle at the far end of
    the half-cleared lot appeared a shaggy pony, limping wofully,
    but with ears pricked forward as a sign of welcome to his
    mistress.</p>

    <p>"Come on, Little Hawss!" she called. "Come on! It hurts, I
    know, for you to step, but come on, just th' same. I got a
    turnip for you."</p>

    <p>She turned to Layson with an explanation. "He's lame, poor
    Little Hawss is. Don't know's he'll ever get all right
    ag'in."</p>

    <p>"Oh!" said Layson. "And I didn't even know you had a horse."
    Horses are less common in the mountains than are oxen, although
    nearly every mountain farm has one, for riding. Oxen, though,
    are the section's draught-animals.</p>

    <p>"Didn't think I had a hawss?" she said, and laughed. "I'd
    <i>die</i> without a hawss! Why, they say, here in the
    mountains, that I'm a good rider. I've raced all the boys and
    beat 'em on my Little Hawss."</p>

    <p>She petted the affectionate, uncouth little beast and fed
    him slowly, lovingly. "Little Hawss, before he hurt his hoof,
    was sure-footed as a deer. Didn't have to be afraid to run him
    anywhere, on any kind of road at any time of day or night,"
    said she. "Never stumbled, never missed the way, and, while he
    don't <i>look</i> much&mdash;he never did&mdash;he could just
    carry <i>me</i> to suit me! But&mdash;well, I don't know as he
    will ever carry me again!"</p>

    <p>Layson, himself a great horse lover, went up to the shaggy
    little beast and petted him. The pony knew a friend
    instinctively and rubbed his nose against the rough sleeve of
    his jacket while he munched the turnip.</p>

    <p>Madge stooped and lifted the poor beast's crippled foot.</p>

    <p>"Looks bad, don't it?" she said anxiously, asking Frank's
    opinion as an expert.</p>

    <p>He looked the bad foot over carefully and shook his
    head.</p>

    <p>"Madge, I am afraid it does," said he. "But wait until the
    Colonel comes. He'll tell you what to do. No man knows horses
    better than the Colonel does.</p>

    <p>"I've never told you of my horse, have I?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"Why, no; you got one, too?"</p>

    <p>He drew a long breath of enthusiasm at the mere thought of
    his greatest treasure. "Such a mare," said he, "as rarely has
    been seen, even in Kentucky. She's famous now and going to be
    more so. She's the very apple of my eye."</p>

    <p>The girl looked at him wide-eyed with a fascinated interest.
    "What color is she?"</p>

    <p>"Black as night."</p>

    <p>"And gentle?"</p>

    <p>"Ah, gentle as a dove with friends; but she's not gentle if
    she happens to dislike a man or woman! Why, if she hates you,
    keep away from her. She'll side-step with a cunning that would
    fool the wisest so's to get a chance for a left-handed kick;
    she'll bite; she'll strike with her forefeet the way a human
    fighter would."</p>

    <p>"Oh!" said the girl. "Ain't it a pity she's so ugly?"</p>

    <p>"I said she's gentle with her friends. She'd no more kick at
    me than I would kick at her. She knows it. She's intelligent
    beyond most horseflesh."</p>

    <p>"Has she ever won in races?"</p>

    <p>"She's won in small events, and great things are expected of
    her by more folk than I when she gets going on the larger
    tracks. I'm counting on her for good work this year, after I go
    home again."</p>

    <p>"Ah," sighed the girl, carried quite away by his excited
    talk about his favorite, "how I'd love to see her run!"</p>

    <p>"It's poetry," he granted; "the true poetry of motion."</p>

    <p>"And this Cunnel&mdash;Cunnel&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Colonel Doolittle?"</p>

    <p>"Uh-huh. Will he help me, do you s'pose, to get my Little
    Hawss cured of his lameness?"</p>

    <p>"You may count on that."</p>

    <p>"Who else is comin' here to see you?" she inquired, as they
    left Little Hawss wistfully agaze at them across the old log
    fence.</p>

    <p>Layson, for no reason he could think of, felt a bit
    uncomfortable, as he replied. He temporized before he really
    told her of what worried him.</p>

    <p>"Well," said he, "there'll be old Neb&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Who's he?"</p>

    <p>"A servant who has been in our family for years. He is a
    fine old darkey and we love him&mdash;everyone of us."</p>

    <p>"And will he be all?"</p>

    <p>"No; I understand that Mr. Horace Holton, also, will come
    with the party. Mr. Holton and his daughter."</p>

    <p>It is possible that he may have flushed a little, as he
    spoke about this matter, or there may have been some slight
    hint of the unusual in his voice. At any rate, the notice of
    the girl was instantly attracted.</p>

    <p>"Daughter?" she inquired.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Frank, "his daughter Barbara."</p>

    <p>"How old is she?" Madge's curiosity had been aroused at
    once.</p>

    <p>"About your age."</p>

    <p>She was delighted. "And will I surely see her?"</p>

    <p>"Yes; of course."</p>

    <p>"Do you suppose she'll like me?"</p>

    <p>Layson, from what he knew of Barbara Holton, scarcely
    thought she would. He could not make his fancy paint a picture
    of the haughty lowlands beauty showing much consideration for
    this little mountain waif; but he did not say so. He answered
    hesitatingly, and she noticed it.</p>

    <p>"You don't think she'll like me!" she exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"I didn't say so. Certainly she'll like you. Who could help
    it, Madge?" He smiled. It did not seem to him, as his eyes
    studied her, that anybody of sound sense could.</p>

    <p>She sighed. "A woman could." She spoke with an instinctive
    wisdom which her isolated life among the crags and peaks had
    not deprived her of. "A woman always can. But, my, I hope she
    will!"</p>

    <p>"She will," said Frank. "She will. And my dear
    Aunt&mdash;oh, you will love her."</p>

    <p>"Miss Aluth&mdash;Aluth&mdash;?" She stopped, questioningly,
    still bothered by the name.</p>

    <p>"Miss Alathea," he prompted. "She'll like you and you'll
    love her."</p>

    <p>The girl smiled happily. "Uh-huh." Her acquiescence was
    immediate. "Reckon maybe I'll love <i>her</i>, all right, and I
    <i>hope</i> the other will come true, too." Suddenly she was
    stricken with a fear. "But she won't, though&mdash;dressed the
    way I be!"</p>

    <p>"What you wear would make no difference to my Aunt Alathea,"
    Frank protested, "any more than it would make to Colonel
    Doolittle."</p>

    <p>She did not speak again for quite a time, walking along the
    narrow mountain-path with eyes fixed, but unseeing, on the
    trail. It was plain that in her mind grave problems were being
    closely studied.</p>

    <p>"Maybe," she said, at length, "I won't be so very
    <i>awful</i> as you <i>think</i>!"</p>

    <p>They had reached the path which led first to the bridge
    across the mountain-chasm making the rock on which her cabin
    stood an island, and then, across this draw-bridge, to the
    cabin itself. She waved a gay and unexpected good-bye to
    him.</p>

    <p>He felt strangely robbed. He had expected another half-hour
    with her. It astonished him to learn through this tiny
    disappointment how agreeable the little mountain maid's society
    had come to be.</p>

    <p>He was wakeful that night till a later hour than usual.</p>

    <p>Somehow he was not as thoroughly delighted as he felt that
    he should be by the prospect of his guests' arrival. His
    journey to the mountains and his sojourn there had been
    considered rather foolish by his friends, but he had wished to
    make quite sure that what was said about the wild mountain
    lands which formed the greater portion of his
    patrimony&mdash;that they were practically valueless&mdash;was
    true, ere he gave up all hope of profiting from them.</p>

    <p>The building of the railroad through the valley had imbued
    him with some hope that they might not prove to be as useless
    as they had been thought to be, and it had been that which had
    induced him, at the start, to make the journey.</p>

    <p>Once arrived he had found the mountain air delightful, the
    fishing fine, the shooting all that could be wished, and had
    enjoyed these to their full, investigating, meanwhile, his
    rough property; but as he lay there in his shack of logs and
    puncheons he acknowledged to himself that it was none of these
    things which now made the mountains so attractive. It was the
    nymph of the woods pool, the mountain-side Europa on her bull,
    his little pupil of the alphabet, in plain reality, who now
    held him to the wilderness.</p>

    <p>He wondered just what this could mean. Could it be possible
    that he was thinking seriously of the little maid <i>in that
    way</i>?</p>

    <p>He almost laughed at the idea, there alone in the woods
    cabin, with the stars in their deep velvet canopy twinkling
    through the window at him and the glow of his cob pipe for
    company.</p>

    <p>But his laugh was not too genuine. He found himself, to his
    amazement, comparing Madge, the mountain girl, with Barbara
    Holton, the elegant daughter of the lowlands, and finding many
    points in favor of the little rustic maiden. He wondered just
    how serious his attentions to fair Barbara had been thought to
    be by her, her father, Horace Holton, and by other people.
    There were many things about Madge Brierly, which, as he sat
    there, reflective, he found admirable, besides her vivid,
    vigorous young beauty. He could not bring himself, as he sat
    thinking of the two girls, widely separated as they were in the
    great social plane, unevenly matched as they had been in early
    training, to admit that the whole advantage was upon the side
    of Barbara Holton.</p>

    <p>And above him, in her lonely little cabin on the towering
    rock, upon all sides of which the mountain-torrent, making it
    an isle of safety for her there in the wilderness, roared
    rythmically, the mountain maiden who so occupied his thoughts
    was busy with her crude wardrobe.</p>

    <p>In complete dissatisfaction she put aside, at length, every
    garment of her own which she possessed as unsuitable for the
    great day when she was to meet the bluegrass gentlefolk.</p>

    <p>Then, remembering suddenly an old chest which held her
    mother's wedding finery, she strained her fine young muscles as
    she dragged it out of storage; and sitting on the floor beside
    it where the great blaze of pine-knots in the big
    "mud-and-broke-rock" fireplace lighted it and her with
    flickering brilliance, she went through it with reverent
    fingers, searching, searching for such garments and such
    adornments as it might hold to make her fit to meet the friends
    of the young lowlander who had captured her imagination with
    his bravery, resource and courtesy.</p>

    <p>There were a few things in the chest which pleased her, and
    she smiled as she discovered them, smiled as she tried them on,
    smiled as she saw the image wearing them in the cracked mirror
    by the side of the big fireplace. She had to make experiments
    with dripping tallow dips before she got a light which would
    enable her to get the full effect of an ornate old poke-bonnet
    which was the chief treasure from the chest, but finally she
    did so, and exclaimed in pleasure as she managed it.</p>

    <p>It was, indeed, a charming picture which she saw there in
    the glass&mdash;a face with rosy cheeks, bright eyes, red lips
    set off with softly waving auburn hair and framed delightfully
    in the old arch of shirred red silk&mdash;and when she took it
    off, at last, she was convinced that one, at least, of her big
    problems had been solved. She had a bonnet, certainly, which
    was as lovely as the finest thing that any bluegrass belle
    could wear. There was not the slightest doubt that all its
    shirring was of real, <i>real</i> silk! She had run her fingers
    over it caressingly, delighted by its sheen and gloss when she
    had been a little girl; now she fondled it with loving touch,
    high hopes. Surely no young lady visitor, even from the far off
    and to her mysterious bluegrass could have anything much finer
    than that bonnet with its silken facings! She tied the wide
    strings underneath her chin in a great, flaring bow, and peeped
    forth from the cavernous depths of the arched "poke" with quite
    unconscious coquetry, flirting, with the keenest relish and
    most completely childish pleasure with the charming creature
    whom she saw reflected on the little mirror's cracked,
    imperfect surface.</p>

    <p>It was while she stood thus, innocently coquetting with her
    own delightful picture, that a great plan for the plenishment
    of her otherwise imperfect wardrobe popped into her active,
    searching mind. Carefully she considered this, first before the
    glass and then, with feet crossed and clasped hands between her
    knees, before the roaring fire of resinous pine-knots in the
    old fireplace.</p>

    <p>Having finally decided that it was a good one, she went
    about the cabin seeing to the fastenings of doors and windows,
    wholly unafraid despite her solitude. There was but one way of
    approaching this, her fastness in the rocks, and the bridge,
    had been drawn up for the night. Safe she was as any Rhenish
    baron in his moated stronghold.</p>

    <p>Conscious that a busy day was looming large before her, she
    now blew out her candles and crept into her little curtained
    bed, to dream, there, vividly, of haughty beauties from the
    bluegrass staring in astonishment as they first glimpsed the
    beauty of a little mountain girl in such a gorgeous outfit as
    they had not in all their pampered lives conceived; of lovely
    aunts who smiled with pleasure when they saw their handsome
    nephews step up to this splendid maiden and take her hands in
    theirs; of wondrous youths&mdash;ah, these images were never
    absent from the scenes her fancy painted!&mdash;who scorned the
    haughty bluegrass beauties in favor of the freckled little
    fists of those same brilliant mountain maidens, and, lo! by
    taking those same freckled fists in theirs, removed the
    freckles and the callouses of work as if by magic, making them
    as white and fine&mdash;aye, whiter, finer!&mdash;than the
    haughty bluegrass beauty's. And in her dreams, too, was a
    gallant horseman, wise in equine ways, who came to her with
    handsome chargers trailing from fair-leather lead straps to
    present her with the thoroughbreds because her little, shaggy
    pony limped.</p>

    <p>Queer fancies of the strange life of the lowlands which he
    had described to her, flashed, also, through her ignorant but
    active brain in fascinating visions. She thought she saw the
    houses on the tops of houses which he had described to her, in
    efforts to assist her to imagine structures more elaborate than
    the little, single storied cabins which were all that she had
    ever seen. Strange conceptions of the railroad, with its
    monstrous engines puffing smoke and fire would have been
    terrifying had there not been, ever at her side as dreams
    revealed them, a stalwart youth in corduroys to bear her from
    their path through rings of burning thickets.</p>

    <p>Again she trembled in imagination at the thought of meeting
    the fine ladies who would be dressed with such elaboration and
    impressive elegance; but each time, when her dream seemed
    actually to lead her to them, there he was to help her through
    the great ordeal with heartening smiles and comforting
    suggestions.</p>

    <p>Her sleep was restless, but delightful. Once she woke and
    left her bed to peer out of the window, wondering if, by
    chance, she might not glimpse a light in Layson's camp far down
    the mountain-side. She was disappointed when she found she
    could not, but went back to bed to find there further
    compensating dreams.</p>

    <p>There might have been still greater compensation for her had
    she known that at the very moment when she peered out through
    the darkness, looking for some vagrant glimmer of a light from
    Layson's camp, he had, himself, just gone back to his cabin
    after having stood a long time staring through the darkness
    toward her own small cabin in its fastness.</p>

    <p>He was thinking, thinking, thinking. The little mountain
    maid had strangely fascinated the highly cultivated youth from
    the far bluegrass. He did not know quite what to make of the
    queer way in which her fresh and lovely, girlish face, obtruded
    itself constantly into his thoughts. And as for the haughty
    bluegrass belle whom poor Madge dreaded so&mdash;he did not
    think of her, at all, save, possibly, with half acknowledged
    annoyance at the fact that she was coming to spy out his
    wilderness and those who dwelt therein. He would have been a
    little happier if he could have remained there, undisturbed,
    for a time longer.</p>

    <p>Day had not dawned when Madge awoke. The sun, indeed, had
    just begun to poke the red edge of his disc above Mount Nebo,
    when, having built her fire and cooked her frugal breakfast,
    she loosed the rope which held the crude, small draw-bridge up
    and lowered the rickety old platform until it gave a pathway
    over the deep chasm and carried her to the mainland, ready for
    the journey to the distant cross-roads store.</p>

    <p>Dew, sparkling like cut diamonds, cool as melting ice, was
    everywhere in the brilliant freshness of the morning; the birds
    were busy with their gossip and their foraging, chattering
    greetings to her as she passed; in her pasture her cow, Sukey,
    had not risen yet from her comfortable night posture when she
    reached her. The animal looked up gravely at her, chewing
    calmly on her cud, plainly not approving, quite, of such a very
    early call. While the girl sat on the one-legged stool beside
    her, sending white, rich, fragrant streams into the resounding
    pail, her shaggy Little Hawss limped up, nosing at her pocket
    for a turnip, which he found, of course, abstracted cleverly
    and munched.</p>

    <p>Having finished with the cow she set the milk in a
    fence-corner to wait for her return, and, when she left the
    lot, the pony followed her, making a difficult, limping way
    along the inside of the rough stump-fence until he came to a
    cross barrier. Then, as he saw that she was going on and
    leaving him behind, he nickered lonesomely, and, although she
    planned, that day to accomplish many, many things, and, in
    consequence, was greatly pressed for time, she went back to him
    and petted him a moment and then found another turnip for him
    in her pocket.</p>

    <p>The journey which began, thus, with calls on her four-footed
    friends, was solitary, afterward, although in the narrow
    road-bed, here and there, she saw impressions of preceding
    footsteps, big and deep. They aroused her curiosity, and with
    keen instinct of the woods she studied one of them elaborately.
    Rising from her pondering above it she decided that Joe Lorey
    had gone on before her, and wondered what could possibly have
    sent him down the trail so early in the morning. When she noted
    that his trail turned off at the cross-roads which might lead
    to Layson's camp (or other places) her heart sank for a moment.
    She realized how bitterly the mountaineer felt toward the
    bluegrass youth whom he considered his successful rival and she
    hoped that trouble would not come of it. She did not love Joe
    Lorey as he wished to have her love him, but she had a very
    real affection for him, none the less. And&mdash;and&mdash;she
    did&mdash;she did&mdash;she <i>did</i>&mdash;this morning she
    acknowledged it!&mdash;love Layson. The matter worried her,
    somewhat. Trouble between the men was more than possible, she
    knew; but, on reflection, she decided that Joe had not been
    bound for Layson's camp, but, by a short cut, to the distant
    valley. This alone would have explained his very early start.
    He was not one to seek to take his enemy while sleeping, and
    she knew and knew he knew that the lowlander slept late. Lorey
    would not do a thing dishonorable. She put the thought of
    trouble that day from her, therefore, yielding gladly to the
    joyous and absorbing magic of the growing, splendid
    morning.</p>

    <p>The rising sun, with its ever changing spectacle,
    exhilerating, splendid, awe-inspiring, there among the
    mountains, raised her spirits as she travelled, and drove
    gloomy thoughts away as it drove off the brooding mists which
    clung persistently, tearing themselves to tattered ribbons ere
    they would loose their hold upon the peaks beyond the valley
    and behind her.</p>

    <p>A feeling of elation grew in her&mdash;elation born of her
    abounding health, fine youth, the glory of the scene, the high
    intoxication of first love.</p>

    <p>She beguiled the way with mountain ballads, paused, here and
    there, to pluck some lovely flower, accumulating, presently, a
    nosegay so enormous as to be almost unwieldy, whistled to the
    birds and smiled as they sent back their answers, laughed at
    the fierce scolding of a squirrel on a limb, heard the doleful
    wailing of young foxes and crept near enough their burrow to
    see them huddled in the sand before it, waiting eagerly for
    their foraging mother and the breakfast she would bring.</p>

    <p>When the trail crossed a clear brook she paused upon the
    crude, low bridge and watched the trout dart to and fro beneath
    it; where it debouched upon a hill-side of commanding view she
    stopped there, breathing hard from sheer enjoyment of the glory
    of the prospect spread before her in the valley.</p>

    <p>She was very happy, as she almost always was of summer
    mornings. The mountain air, circulating in her young and sturdy
    lungs, was almost as intoxicating as strong wine and made the
    blood leap through her arteries, thrill through her veins.</p>

    <p>The worries of the night before seemed, for a time, to have
    been groundless. She ceased to fear her meeting with the
    bluegrass gentlefolk and looked forward to it with real
    confidence and pleasure. Her confidence in Layson was
    abounding, and she assured herself till the thought became
    conviction that he never would permit her to subject herself to
    anything which properly could be humiliating.</p>

    <p>The problem of her garb, too, began to seem far less
    insoluble than it had seemed the night before. She felt
    certain, as she travelled with her springing step, that she
    would find it possible to meet creditably the great emergency
    with what she had at home and could discover at the little
    general-store which she was bound for.</p>

    <p>When she reached the tiny, mud-chinked structure at the
    cross-roads, though, and caught her first glimpse of its
    lightly burdened shelves, her heart sank for an instant. Could
    it be possible that from its stock she would be able to select
    material with which she could compete with folk from the far
    bluegrass in elegance of garb?</p>

    <p>But after she had made investigation and had interested in
    her project the lank mountain-woman who presided at the
    counter, she lost fear of the result. Together they made
    careful study of the fashion-papers which the woman had
    preserved and which the girl had, the night before, remembered
    with such vividness. Through discussion and reiterated
    reassurance from her friend, she finally arrived at the
    decision that with what she had at hand at home and what she
    could buy here, she could prepare herself to meet the elegant
    lowlanders with a fairly ample rivalry.</p>

    <p>There were few bolts of cloth, of whatever quality or
    character in the pitiful little general-store's stock which
    both women did not finger speculatively that morning; there was
    not a piece of pinchbeck jewelry in the small showcase which
    they did not study carefully. Especially Madge dwelt on combs,
    for Layson, once, had mentioned combs as parts of the adornment
    of the women whom he knew. There in the mountains young girls
    did not wear them, save of the "circular" variety, designed to
    hold back "shingled" tresses. But from underneath a box of
    faded gum-drops and the store's one carton of cigars, came some
    of imitation tortoise-shell, gilt ornamented, of the sort old
    ladies sometimes stuck into their hirsute knots for mountain
    "doings" of great elegance, and the best of these Madge bought.
    Also she bought lace&mdash;great quantities of it, although,
    even after she had made the purchase, she had some doubt of
    just what she would do with it; she also had some doubt about
    its quality, for in the chest at home there had been lace,
    ripped from her mother's wedding gown, of far different and
    more convincing texture and design. She realized, however, that
    what was there must be what must suffice and purchased nearly
    all the woman had of cheap, machine-made mesh and home-worked,
    coarse-threaded tatting.</p>

    <p>She could not manage gloves. The store had never had gloves
    in its stock designed for anything but warmth, and, although
    Layson had explained to her, in answer to her curious
    pleadings, that the girls he knew down in the bluegrass
    sometimes wore gloves covering their bare arms to the elbows,
    she gave up the hope of finding anything of that sort without a
    visit to the distant valley town, and this was quite
    impossible, now that her pony had gone lame, so she sighed and
    gave up gloves entirely.</p>

    <p>But she bought ribbons by the bolt, some gay
    silk-handkerchiefs, a little of the less obtrusive of the
    jewelry, and needles, thread and such small trifles by the
    score to be utilized in making alterations in the finery from
    her dead mother's treasure chest at home there in the mountain
    cabin. It was with heart not quite so doubtful of her own
    ability to shine a bit, that, after she had borrowed every
    fashion-plate the woman owned (many of them ten years old; not
    one of them of later date than five years previous), she set
    out upon the long and weary homeward way.</p>

    <p>Instinctively as she progressed she searched the soft mud in
    the shadowed places of the road, the soft sand wherever it
    appeared, for signs that those great foot-marks which she had
    thought she could identify as Lorey's in the morning, had
    returned while she was at the store. Nowhere was there any
    trace that this had happened, and again she thrilled with
    apprehension. Almost she made a detour by the road which led to
    Layson's camp to make quite sure that all was right with the
    young "foreigner," but this idea she abandoned as much because
    she felt that such a visit would necessitate an explanation
    which she would dislike to make, as because her many burdens
    would have made the way a long and difficult one to tread. How
    could she tell Layson that Joe Lorey might resent his helping
    her to study, might resent the other hours which they had spent
    so pleasantly among the mountain rocks and forest trees
    together, might, in short, be jealous of him?</p>

    <p>Her shy, maiden soul revolted at the thought and perforce
    she gave investigation up, her thoughts, finally, turning from
    the really remote chance of a difficulty between the men to the
    pleasanter task of carrying on her planning for new gowns and
    small accessories of finery.</p>

    <p>The homeward way was longer than the journey down had been,
    because of her new burdens and the frequently steep mountain
    slopes which she must climb, but she travelled it without much
    thought of this.</p>

    <p>Never in her life had come excitement equal to that which
    possessed her as she thought about the visitors, longed to make
    a good impression and not shame her friend, wondered how the
    bluegrass ladies would be dressed, would talk, would act, and
    what they all would think of her. She had decided, in advance,
    that she would like Miss Alathea, aunt of her woodland
    instructor; she knew positively that she would like the doughty
    colonel, lover of god horses, barred from racing by his love
    for Frank's inexorable aunt.</p>

    <p>But the other members of the party he had told
    about&mdash;the Holtons&mdash;she was not so sure that she
    would care for them. Frank, himself, when he had told her of
    them, had spoken of the father without much enthusiasm, and she
    felt quite sure that she could never like the daughter. She had
    noticed, she believed, that when it came to talk of her her
    friend had hesitated with embarrassment. Could it be possible
    that this young lady who had had the chances she, herself, had
    been denied, for education and for everything desirable, would
    seem to him, when she appeared upon the scene, less lovely,
    less desirable, than a simple little mountain maid like poor
    Madge Brierly? The thought seemed quite incredible and the
    worry of it quite absorbed her for a time and drove away
    forebodings about the possible hatred of Joe Lorey for Layson
    and his possible expression of resentment. She even ceased her
    wonderings about the footsteps which had gone down the road,
    that morning, and which, so far as she could see, had not come
    back again.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2><br>


    <p>They were, indeed, the great imprints of Joe Lorey's
    hob-nailed boots, quite as she suspected. Long before the sun
    had risen the young mountaineer, distressed by worries which
    had made his night an almost sleepless one, had risen and
    wandered from his little cabin, lonelier in its far solitude,
    even than the girl's. For a time he had crouched upon a stump
    beneath the morning stars with lowering brows, sunk deep in
    harsh, resentful thought, forgetful of the falling dew, the
    chill of the keen mountain air, of everything, in fact, save
    the gnawing apprehension that the "foreigner," who had invaded
    this far mountain solitude might, with his better manners,
    infinitely better education and divers other devilish wiles of
    the low country, snatch from him the prize which he had grown
    up longing to possess.</p>

    <p>The youthful mountaineer's distress was not without its
    pathos. He loved the girl, had loved her since they had been
    toddling children playing in the hills together. Never for an
    instant had his firm devotion to her wandered to any other of
    the mountain girls; never for an instant had he had any hope
    but that of, some day, winning her. That he recognized the real
    superiority of Layson made his worry the more tragic, for it
    made it the more hopeless.</p>

    <p>A dull resentment thrilled him, not only against this man,
    but against the whole tribe of his people, who were, in these
    uncomfortable days, invading the rough country which, to that
    time, had been the undisputed domain of the mountaineer. He
    thought with bitterness about the growing valley towns, which
    he had sometimes visited on court days when some mountain man
    had been haled there to trial for moonshining or for a feud
    "killing." He did not understand those lowland people who
    assumed the right to dictate to him and his kind as to the
    lives which they should lead in their own country, and he hated
    them instinctively. Vaguely he felt the greater power which
    education and a rubbing of their elbows with the progress of
    the world had given them and definitely resented it. Scotch
    highlander never felt a greater hatred and distrust of lowland
    men than does the highlander of the old Cumberlands feel for
    the people who have claimed the rich and fertile bottom lands,
    filled the towns which have sprung up there, established the
    prosperity which has, through them, advanced the state. The
    mountain men of Tennessee and of Kentucky are almost as
    primitive, to-day, as were their forefathers, who, early in the
    great transcontinental migration, dropped from its path and
    spread among the hills a century ago, rather than continue with
    the weary march to more fertile, fabled lands beyond.</p>

    <p>It had not been, as Madge had feared, his definite hatred of
    Frank Layson which had started him upon the road so early in
    the morning, but, rather, an unrest born of the whole problem
    of the "foreigners'" invasion of the mountains. His restless
    discontent with Layson's presence had left him ready for
    excitement over wild tales told in store and cabin of what the
    young man's fellows were doing in the valley. He had determined
    to go thither for himself, to see with his own eyes the
    wonder-workers, although he hated both the wonders and the men
    who were accomplishing them.</p>

    <p>What did the mountain-country want of railroads? What did it
    want of towns? The railroads would but bring more interlopers
    and in the towns they would foregather, arrogant in their firm
    determination to force upon the men who had first claimed the
    country their artificial rules and regulations. Timid in their
    fear of those they sought to furtively dislodge and of the
    rough love these men showed of a liberty including license,
    they would huddle in their storied buildings, crowd in their
    trammelled streets, work and worry in their little offices
    absurdly, harmfully to the rights of proper men. Like other
    mountaineers Joe had small realization of the advantages of
    easy interchange of thought and the quick commerce which come
    with aggregation. He thought the concentration of the townsfolk
    was a sign of an unmanly dread of those first settlers whom
    they wished to drive away unjustly, subjugate and ruin.</p>

    <p>Throughout the mountains blazed a fierce resentment of the
    railroad builders' presence and their work; in no heart did it
    burn more fiercely than in poor Joe Lorey's, for the fear
    obsessed him that a member of the army of invaders had
    succeeded in depriving him of the last chance of getting that
    which, among all things on earth, he longed for
    most&mdash;Madge Brierly's love. He did not stop to think that
    before the "foreigner" had come the girl had more than once
    refused to marry him, begging him to remain her good, kind
    friend. Such episodes, in those days, had not in the least
    disheartened him. He had always thought that in the end the
    girl <i>would</i> "have him." But now he was convinced his
    chance was gone, his last hope vanished. The "foreigner" had
    fascinated Madge, made him look cheap and coarse, uncouth and
    undesirable.</p>

    <p>As he had walked along the roads which, later in the
    morning, Madge had followed, he had frowned blackly at the
    sunrise and the waking birds, kicked viciously at little sticks
    and stones which chanced along his way. Never a smile had he
    for chattering squirrel or scampering chipmunk; fierce,
    repellant was the brown brow of the mountaineer, despite the
    glory of the morning, and black the heart within him with sheer
    hatred of Frank Layson and the class he represented.</p>

    <p>His journey was much longer than the girl's, for it did not
    end till he had reached the rude construction camp of the
    advancing railroad builders in the valley far below the little
    mountain-store. There he gazed at what was going on with a
    child's wonder, which, at first, almost made him lose his
    memory of what he thought his wrongs, but, later, aggravated it
    by emphasizing in his mind his own great ignorance.</p>

    <p>Through a tiny temporary town of corrugated iron shanties,
    crude log-and-brush and rough-plank sheds, white canvas tents,
    ran the raw, heaped earth of the embankment. About it swarmed a
    thousand swarthy laborers, chattering in a tongue less easy to
    his ears than the harsh scoldings of the squirrels he had seen
    while on his way. Back behind them stretched two lines of
    shining rails, which, even as he watched, advanced, advanced on
    the embankment, being firmly spiked upon their cross-ties so as
    to form a highway for the cars which brought more dirt, more
    dirt, more dirt to send the raw embankment on ahead of
    them.</p>

    <p>At first the puffing, steam-spitting, fire-spouting
    locomotive with its deafening exhaust and strident whistle,
    clanging bell and glowing fire-box actually frightened him. As
    he stood close by the track and it came on threateningly, he
    backed away, his rifle held in his crooked arm, ready for some
    great emergency, he knew not what. A laborer laughed at him,
    and his hands instinctively took firmer grip upon the rifle.
    The laborer stopped laughing.</p>

    <p>Some lessons of the temper of the mountaineers already had
    been learned along the line of that new railroad, and, driven
    from his wrath by the appearance of new marvels, Joe, at
    greater distance, sat upon a stump and watched, wide-eyed, and
    undisturbed, unridiculed.</p>

    <p>For a long time his resentment wholly drowned itself in
    wonder at the puzzle of the engines, the mechanism of the
    dump-cars, the wondrous working of the small steam crane which
    lifted rails from flat-cars, and, as a strong man guided them,
    dropped them with precision at the time and place decided on
    beforehand. He noted how the men worked in great gangs, subject
    to the orders of one "boss," a phenomenon of organization he
    had never seen before, with unwilling admiration.</p>

    <p>But presently, from a point well in advance of that where
    rails already had been laid and upon which his attention had
    been concentrated because of the machinery there, there came a
    mighty boom of dynamite. It startled him so greatly that he
    sprang up, bewildered, ready for whatever might be coming, but
    wholly at a loss as to just what the threatening danger might
    be. His fright gave rise to jeering laughter from the men who
    had been watching with a covert eye the rough, determined
    looking mountaineer, squatting on the stump with rifle on his
    arm. He turned on them so fiercely that they shrank back,
    terrified by the look they saw in his grey eyes.</p>

    <p>Then, noting that the noise had not appalled them in the
    least and assuming that what was surely safe for them was safe
    enough for him, he sauntered down the line, attempting to seem
    careless in his walk, until he reached the gang which was busy
    at destruction of a high, obstructive cropping of grey
    granite.</p>

    <p>For hours he sat there watching them with curiosity. He saw
    them pierce the rocks with hammered drills; he saw them then
    put in a small, round, harmless looking paper cylinder which,
    of course, he knew held something like gunpowder; he saw them
    tamp it down with infinite care, leaving only a protruding
    fuse; he saw them light the fuse and scamper off to a safe
    distance while he watched the sputtering sparks run down the
    fuse, pause at the tamping, then, having pierced it, disappear.
    The great explosions which succeeded were, at first, a little
    hard upon his nerves, but he saw that those who compassed them
    did not flinch when they came, and, after he had dodged
    ridiculously at the first, received the second with a greater
    calm, keyed himself to almost motionless reception of the
    third, and managed to sit listening to the fourth with
    self-possession quite as great as theirs, his face impassive
    and his frame immovable.</p>

    <p>He noted with amazement the great force of the infernal
    power the burning fuses loosed, and knew, instinctively, that
    the explosive was a stronger one than that with which he had
    been thoroughly familiar since his earliest
    childhood&mdash;gunpowder. He wondered mightily what it could
    be, and, finally, summoned courage to inquire of one of the
    swart laborers.</p>

    <p>These were the first words he had spoken that day, and,
    although the man was courteous enough in answering, "Dynamite,"
    he thought he saw a smile upon his face of veiled derision, and
    resented it so fiercely that instead of thanking him he gave
    him a black look and sauntered off. But he had learned what the
    explosive was; before he went away he had seen it used in
    half-a-dozen ways and had a visual demonstration of the
    necessity for caution in its handling. One of the young and
    cocky engineers, whom he so hated, dropped by dread mischance a
    heavy hammer on a stick of it, and the resulting turmoil left
    him lying torn and mangled on the rocks.</p>

    <p>Lorey felt small sympathy for the man's suffering, although
    he never had seen any human being mutilated thus before. Many a
    man he had seen lying with a clean hole through his forehead,
    the neat work of a definitely aimed bullet; assassination and
    the spectacles it carried with it could not worry him: his
    childhood and young manhood had been passed where "killings"
    were too frequent; the man, like all the others there at work,
    was his enemy, and he sorrowed for him not at all; but this
    tearing, mangling laceration of human flesh and bone was
    horrifying to him.</p>

    <p>Later, though, a certain comfort came to him from it. The
    whole scene had impressed him and depressed him. He remembered
    what Madge Brierly had said about the engineers with their blue
    paper plans and their ability to read from them and work by
    them. He saw them at their work, and the spectacle made him
    feel inferior, which had never happened in his free,
    untrammeled life of mountain independence before. There were a
    dozen men about the work of the same type as Layson's, and
    their calm cocksureness as they directed all these mysteries
    amazed him, overwhelmed him, made him feel a sense of
    littleness and unimportance which was maddening. Why should
    they know all these things when he, Joe Lorey, who had lived a
    decent life according to his lights, had labored with his
    muscles as theirs could not labor if they tried to force them
    to, had lived upon rough fare and in rough places while they
    had had such "fancinesses" as he saw spread before them at
    their mess-tent dinner (and crude fare enough it seemed to
    them, no doubt) knew none of them? He could see no justice in
    such matters and resented them with bitter heart. If their own
    infernal powder had killed one of them he would not mourn. He
    tried to look back at the accident with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Had he gone down to that crude construction camp without the
    jealousy of Layson in his heart, he might, possibly, have
    merely gazed in wonder at the cleverness of all this work,
    despite his mountaineer's resentment of the coming of the
    interlopers; but, with that resentment in his heart to nag and
    worry him, he achieved, before the day was over, a real hatred
    of the class and of each individual in it. Layson had come up
    there to his country to rob him of the girl he loved; now these
    men were coming with their railroad to change the aspect of the
    land he had been born to and grown up in, making it a strange
    place, unfamiliar, unwelcoming and crowded. He hated every one
    of them, he hated the new railroad they were building, he hated
    their new-fangled and mysterious machinery which puzzled him
    with intricate devices and appalled him with its power of fire
    and steam.</p>

    <p>By the time the afternoon was two hours old he was in a
    state of sullen fury, silent, morose, miserable on the stump
    which he had chosen as his vantage point for observation. More
    than once an engineer looked at him with plain admiration of
    his mammoth stature in his eyes; many a town-girl, seeing him,
    like a statue of The Pioneer upon a fitting pedestal, made
    furtive eyes at him, for he was handsome and attractive in his
    rough ensemble; but he paid no heed to any of them. He was
    giving his mind over to consideration of his grievance against
    these men who came, with steam and pick and shovel, dynamite
    and railroad iron, invading his domain.</p>

    <p>He thought about his secret still, hidden in its mountain
    fastness, and realized that this new stage of settlement's
    inexorable march meant danger to it; he thought about the game
    which roamed the hills and realized that with the coming of the
    crowd it would soon scatter, never to return; he thought about
    the girl up there, his companion in adversity, his fellow
    sufferer from mutual wrong, the one thing which he had had to
    love, the shining prize which it had been his sole ambition to
    possess for life; he thought of her and then about the man, who
    (product of the same advantages which made these men before him
    clever with their blue-prints and their puffling monsters) had
    come there searching profit from the land which he had never
    loved or lived on, and, seeing Madge, had, Joe thoroughly
    believed, exerted every wile of a superior experience to win
    her from him by fair means or foul. He thought of them and
    hated all of them!</p>

    <p>He was a most unhappy mountaineer who sat there on the
    stump, impassive and morose as the sun progressed upon its
    journey toward the western horizon. All the organized activity
    in the scene about him filled him with resentment and despair.
    In the hills he ever felt his strength: they had presented in
    his whole lifetime few problems which he could not cope with,
    conquer; but here in that construction camp he felt weak,
    incompetent, saw full many a puzzling matter which he could not
    understand. He watched the scene with bitter but with almost
    hopeless eyes. These new forces working here at railroad
    building, working in the hills to rob him of the girl he loved,
    seemed pitilessly strong and terribly mysterious. He never had
    felt helpless in all his life, before. It made him grind his
    teeth with rage.</p>

    <p>But, though it angered him, the tense activity of the
    construction camp was fascinating, too. Especially was his
    attention held spellbound by the ruthless work of the advancing
    blasting gangs. What power lay hidden in those tiny sticks of
    dynamite! How lightly one of them had tossed that poor
    unfortunate in air and left him lying mangled, broken, helpless
    on the ground when it had spent its fury! <i>What a weapon one
    of them would make, upon occasion</i>!</p>

    <p>This thought grew rapidly in his depressed and agitated
    mind. What a weapon, what a weapon! Presently the blasting
    gangs and what they did absorbed his whole attention. He no
    longer paid the slightest heed to the puffing locomotives, busy
    with their dump-cars, to the mysterious steam-shovel, to the
    hand cars with their pumping, flying passengers. The dynamite
    was greater than the greatest of them. One stick of it, if
    properly applied, would blow a locomotive into junk, would tear
    a dump-car, with its massive iron-work and grinding wheels,
    apart and leave mere splinters!</p>

    <p>His thoughts roamed back to his home mountains and pondered
    on the probable effect of this incursion on his personal
    affairs. Not satisfied with tearing up the placid valley, these
    foreigners would, presently, invade the very mountains in their
    turn. He saw the doom of that small, hidden still which had
    been his father's secret, years ago, was now his secret from
    the prying eyes of law and progress. That the "revenuers," soon
    or late, would get it, now that their allies were building
    steel highways to swarm on, was inevitable. His heart beat fast
    with a new anger, anticipatory of their coming to his
    fastness.</p>

    <p>Lying not six feet from him as he sat there thinking
    bitterly of all these things, the foreman of the blasting gang
    had gingerly deposited a dozen sticks of dynamite upon a soft
    cushion of grey blankets. Joe looked at them as they lay there,
    innocent and unimpressive. If he had some of them in the hills
    and the revenuers came to raid his still&mdash;</p>

    <p>The thought sprang into being in his mind with lightning
    quickness and grew there with mushroom growth. Never in his
    life had Lorey stolen anything, although the government would
    have classed him as a criminal because he owned that hidden
    still. His standards, in some things, were different from yours
    and mine, but he had never stolen anything and scorned as low
    beyond the power of words to tell a man who would. But now
    temptation came to him. He wanted some of that explosive.
    Should he buy it, its purchase by a mountaineer would certainly
    attract attention and might thus precipitate the very thing he
    wished to ward away&mdash;a watch of him, and, through that
    espionage, discovery of his secret place among the hills. And
    were not the railroad and the men who owned it robbing him by
    their progression into his own country? They were robbing him
    of peace and quiet, of the possibility of living on the life he
    had been born to and had learned to love! One of the class
    which fostered him was robbing him, he feared with a great
    fear, of the sweet girl whom he loved better than he loved his
    life. Surely it would be no sin, no act of real dishonesty for
    him to slip down from his stump when none was looking and
    secure a stick or two of the explosive!</p>

    <p>Speciously he argued this out in his mind and reached the
    wrong conclusion which he wished to reach.</p>

    <p>If he could but get one of those sticks of dynamite! When
    progress came, as, now, he felt convinced it would, to drive
    him from his mountains and the still which made life possible
    to him, he could meet it, at the start, with one of its own
    weapons. That, even though he had a hundred such, he could
    fight the fight successfully, could, in the end, find triumph,
    he did not for an instant think. The might of the encroaching
    army had impressed him, and he knew that, soon or late, he
    would be forced to yield to it; but he coveted those sticks of
    dynamite. One of them would give him some slight power, at
    least. He acknowledged to himself that he would steal one if he
    got the chance, despite his innate hatred of all pilferers.
    Such theft would merely be the taking of an unimportant tribute
    from the power which would, eventually, claim much, indeed,
    from him.</p>

    <p>From the distance came the screaming whistle of a locomotive
    pulling in along the newly built roadway to eastward. It was
    followed by a flurry of excitement among all the men at work
    around about him.</p>

    <p>"There comes the mail," he heard one handsome young chap
    shout.</p>

    <p>He wore a suit like that which Joe had learned to hate
    because Frank Layson wore it.</p>

    <p>This youth started running down the track, bright-eyed,
    expectant, and a dozen others ran to follow him, leaving
    blue-prints, their surveyors' instruments and other tokens of
    their mysterious might of education, lying unheeded on the
    ground behind them. There was much excitement. Even the rough
    laborers stopped delving at their tasks for a few minutes, to
    straighten from their work and stand, with curious eyes agaze
    down-track.</p>

    <p>In the distance Joe saw smoke arise above the tops of the
    invaded forest-trees. Then he heard the growing clangor of a
    locomotive's bell, then other whistling and the approaching
    rumble of steel wheels upon steel rails, the groan of brake
    shoes gripping, the rattle of contracted couplings, the impact
    of car-bumpers.</p>

    <p>The excitement grew among the working gangs. Even the
    laborers left their tasks and started down the rough surface of
    the new embankment toward the place, a quarter-of-a-mile away,
    where the train would stop at the end of the crude
    ballasting.</p>

    <p>Lorey sat there on his stump, apparently impassive, watching
    all this flurry with resentful, discontented eyes. He himself
    was infinitely curious about the coming train; but he could not
    bring himself to go to see it. He had never seen a railway
    train, but it somehow seemed to him that if he hurried with the
    rest to meet this one it would mean a certain sacrifice of
    dignity in the face of the invading conqueror. He sat there,
    grimly wondering what it might be like, what the people whom it
    brought were like, until, suddenly, he discovered that he was
    alone. The last workman yielding to temptation, free from
    supervision for the moment, had run down the bank to meet the
    train, get mail, see who had come. Lying not a dozen feet away
    from Joe on their grey blanket were the sticks of dynamite.</p>

    <p>Lithe, quick and silent as one of the mountain wild-cats he
    had so often trailed through his domain, he slipped down from
    his stump, caught up a stick of the explosive, tucked it
    carefully into his game-bag, took his place again upon the
    stump, impassive, calm, apparently quite unexcited.</p>

    <p>When the men came trooping back, opening letters, tearing
    wrappers from their newspapers, gossipping, he still sat on the
    stump as they had left him. Not one of them suspected that he
    once had left it.</p>

    <p>"Bright and lively as a cigar-store Indian," he heard one
    care-free youth exclaim as he went by him.</p>

    <p>He did not know what the man meant; he had never seen a
    cigar-store Indian; but he knew a jibe was meant. It did not
    anger him, as it would have done, a few moments earlier. Now he
    had exacted his small tribute. They could stare at him and
    jibe, if they were so inclined. Hidden carefully there in his
    game-bag was one of their own weapons for their fight against
    the wilderness, which, in course of time, might be a weapon of
    the wilderness in fighting against some of them.</p>

    <p>Presently he climbed down from the stump and strolled back
    along the raw embankment toward the little group still standing
    near the train which had arrived.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2><br>


    <p>The young moonshiner stiffened instantly as he neared the
    group of newly arrived travellers, for the first word he heard
    from them was the name of him whom, among all foreigners, he
    hated with most bitterness. An old darky, plainly the servant
    of the party, and such a darky as the mountain country had
    never seen before, was inquiring of a bystander where he could
    find "Marse" Frank Layson.</p>

    <p>The man of whom he asked the question had not the least
    idea, nor had anyone about the railroad working. Most of the
    men had never heard of Layson, and the few who had become
    acquainted with him through chance meetings since he had been
    stopping in his cabin in the mountains, knew most indefinitely
    where the place was located. Lorey could have quickly given the
    information, but had no thought of doing so. He stood, instead,
    staring at the party with wondering but not good-natured eyes,
    and said no word. He certainly was not the one to do a favor to
    his rival or his rival's friends.</p>

    <p>The group of strangers were thrown into confusion by the
    difficulty of getting news of him they sought, and, while they
    discussed the matter, Lorey had a chance to study them. He
    stood upon the rough plank platform, leaning on his rifle, with
    the game-bag and its burden of purloined explosive hanging
    slouchily beneath one arm, his coon-skin cap down well upon his
    eyes, those eyes, half closed, gazing at the newcomers with all
    the curiosity which they would have shown at sight of savages
    from some far foreign shore.</p>

    <p>He was not the only one about the temporary railroad station
    who eyed the group with curiosity and interest. Two of the
    travellers were ladies from the bluegrass and scarcely one of
    all the natives lingering about the workings had ever seen a
    lady from the bluegrass, while, to the young surveyors and the
    group of civil engineers who had, for months, been exiled by
    their work among the mountains from all association with such
    lovely creatures, it was a joy to stand apart and covertly gaze
    at them. Many a young fellow, months away from home, who had
    grasped the newspapers and letters which had come in with the
    other mail with eager fingers, anxious to devour their
    contents, had, after the two ladies had descended from the
    train, almost forgotten his anxiety to get the news from home,
    and stood there, now, with opened letters in his hands,
    unread.</p>

    <p>The ladies were very worthy of attention, too. Miss Alathea
    Layson, the elder of the two, was slight, beautifully groomed
    despite the long and dirty trip on rough cars over the crude
    road-bed of a newly graded railway. A woman whose thirtieth
    birthday had been left behind some years before, she still had
    all the brightness and vivacity of the twenties in her carriage
    and her manner. Her voice, as it drifted to the young
    moonshiner, was a new experience to him&mdash;soft, well
    modulated, cultivated, it was of a sort which he had never
    heard before, and, while it seemed to him affected,
    nevertheless thrilled him with an unacknowledged
    admiration.</p>

    <p>It was she who showed the greatest disappointment about the
    general ignorance concerning Layson's whereabouts, and that
    voice made instantaneous and irresistible appeal to the older
    men among the party of engineers and surveyors, who, finding an
    excuse in her discomfiture, flocked about her, hats off, backs
    bent in humble bows, proffering assistance, three deep in the
    circle.</p>

    <p>The other lady traveller, whom Miss Alathea called Miss
    Barbara, more especially attracted the attention of the younger
    men, and, as they stood aloof to gaze at her, held such
    mountain dwellers as were near, paralyzed with wonder and
    admiration. Nothing so brilliantly beautiful as she in form,
    carriage, face, coloring or dress had ever been seen there in
    the little valley.</p>

    <p>She was a florid girl of twenty, or, perhaps, of twenty-one
    or two. Her eyes were the obtrusive feature of her face, and
    she used them with a freedom which held callow youth
    spellbound. Her gown was more pretentious than that of her more
    elderly companion. This, of course, was justified by the
    difference between their ages; but there seemed to be, beyond
    this, a flaunting gayety about it and her manner which were
    not, in the eyes of the older and wiser men among the group who
    watched, justified by anything. It would have been a hard thing
    for the most critical of them to have definitely mentioned just
    what forced this strong impression on their minds, but it was
    forced upon them very quickly. One of them, a cute and keen
    observer as he was, of many years experience, decided the moot
    point, though, and whispered his decision to a grizzled man
    (the engineer in charge of the whole enterprise upon that
    section of construction) who stood next him.</p>

    <p>"The elder one is of the old-time Southern aristocracy," he
    said. "The younger one is one of the newcomers&mdash;her father
    has made money and she is breaking in by means of it."</p>

    <p>His companion nodded, realizing that the guess was shrewd
    and justified, even if it might, conceivably, be
    inaccurate.</p>

    <p>"She certainly is very striking," he said, nodding, "but the
    elder one is the aristocrat."</p>

    <p>The other member of the party was a big man, nearing fifty,
    with a broad face on which geniality was written in its every
    line, wearing the wide-brimmed Southern hat, typical long
    frock-coat with flaring skirts, black trousers, somewhat
    pegged, and boots of an immaculate brilliance.</p>

    <p>His voice was loud, hearty and attractive, as he made
    inquiries, here and there, about the young man whom they had
    hoped to find in waiting for them at the station, although they
    had arrived, owing to the exigencies of travel by a new road,
    not yet officially opened to traffic, a day before they had
    expected to.</p>

    <p>"I suh," said this gentleman, "am Cunnel
    Doolittle&mdash;Cunnel Sandusky Doolittle, and am looking for
    this lady's nephew, Mr. Layson, suh. If you can tell me where
    the youngster is likely to be runnin', now, you will put me
    under obligations, suh."</p>

    <p>None, however, knew just how Layson could be reached. Most
    of them knew him or had heard of him, but they were not certain
    just where his camp in the mountains was located.</p>

    <p>"I regret, Miss 'Lethe," said the Colonel, turning to the
    disappointed lady at his side, after having completed his
    inquiries, "that there is no good hotel heah. If there were a
    good hotel heah, I would take you to it, ma'am, and make you
    comfortable. Then, ma'am, I would search this country and I'd
    find him in short order. He probably did not receive my letter
    saying that we would arrive to-day and not to-morrow."</p>

    <p>One of the engineers proffered to the ladies the use of his
    own canvas quarters till some course of action should have been
    decided on, an offer which was gratefully accepted.</p>

    <p>Soon afterward inquiries by the Colonel brought out definite
    information as to the exact location of Frank's camp. A railway
    teamster, also, it appeared, was starting in that direction
    after ties and offered to transport a messenger as far as he
    was going, directing him, then, so that he could not lose his
    way. Old Neb, the darky, thereupon, was started on the
    search.</p>

    <p>He was a different sort of negro from any which the mountain
    folk had ever seen, and wore more airs than his "white folks."
    Dressed in a black frock-coat as ornate as the Colonel's,
    although its bagging shoulders showed that it had been a gift
    and not made for him, his hat was a silk tile, a bit too large,
    and in one hand was a gold-headed cane on which he leaned as
    his old legs limped under him. Among the mountaineers about he
    was an object of the keenest curiosity, although down in the
    bluegrass, where old family negroes frequently were let to grow
    into a childish dignity of manner after years of faithful
    service and were not disturbed in their ideas of their own
    importance, he would have been regarded as merely an amusing
    infant of great age, reaping a reward for by-gone merits in the
    careful consideration and indulgence now extended to him. His
    inordinate vanity of his personal appearance and his dignity
    might have given rise to smiles, down there; here there were
    those upon the platform who laughed loudly as he walked away,
    boasting vaingloriously, although he evidently feared the trip
    with the rough teamster, that he would find "young Marse Frank"
    in a jiffy and have him there in no time.</p>

    <p>It was while the aged negro was climbing somewhat
    difficultly to the side of the good-natured railroad teamster
    who had promised to give him a lift upon his way and then
    supply directions for his further progress, that Joe Lorey, who
    had been an interested spectator of the affair, contemptuous,
    amused by the old darky, saw, coming through the crowd behind
    him and well beyond the range of the newly arrived strangers,
    the roughly dressed, mysterious old man whom he had seen, once
    or twice, up in the mountains, whom Madge had seen, tapping
    with his little hammer at the rocks. Lorey looked toward him
    with a face which scowled instinctively. He disliked the man,
    as he disliked all foreigners who dared invasion of his
    wilderness; he would have feared him, too, had he known that it
    had really been him and not young Layson and Madge Brierly who
    had made the noise there in the thicket which had disturbed
    him, that day, when, armed to meet a raid of revenuers, he had
    rushed out from his still to find the girl and the young
    bluegrass gentleman in a close company which worried him almost
    as much as the appearance of the officers, in fact, could have
    done.</p>

    <p>He was a "foreigner," this old man with the manner of the
    mountains, and, sometimes, their speech, for he wore bluegrass
    clothes; therefore he was one to be classed with the others in
    his bitter hatred. He was standing almost in his path, and, by
    stepping to one side, could have saved him a small detour round
    a pile of boxed supplies; but he did not move an inch,
    stiffening, instead, delighted at obstructing him.</p>

    <p>The old man, as he went around, looked sharply at him, and
    then smiled, almost as if he recognized him and could read his
    thoughts; almost as if he realized the man's instinctive hate;
    almost as if he felt a certainty, deep in his soul, that so
    great was the disaster hovering above the mountaineer that it
    would be scarcely worth his own while, now, even to think
    resentfully of this small insult.</p>

    <p>A moment later, though, and the expression of his face had
    changed completely. The first glimpse of the new come party
    standing, now, deep in discussion of the railway work, before
    the engineer's white, hospitable tent, made him start back in
    amazement.</p>

    <p>For an instant he stood wavering, as if he were considering
    the plan of trying to depart without approaching them or being
    seen by them, but then he shrugged his shoulders and advanced,
    trying to show upon his face surprised good-nature.</p>

    <p>"Wall, Colonel Doolittle!" he cried. "And you, Miss Layson,
    and&mdash;why, there's Barbara!"</p>

    <p>"<i>Father!"</i> said the girl, in absolute amazement,
    hurrying toward him.</p>

    <p>"Ah, Mr. Holton!" said Miss 'Lethe, bowing to him as the
    Colonel, plainly not too greatly pleased by the necessity for
    doing so, advanced toward him with extended hand.</p>

    <p>"What brings you all up here?" asked Holton, after the
    greetings had been said.</p>

    <p>"We came up to see Frank and the beauties of his
    long-forgotten land," Miss 'Lethe answered, in her softly
    charming voice. "He has property up here, you know, which has
    been for years a family possession, but which has been
    considered valueless, or almost so. When he learned that this
    new railway was to pass quite close to it, he decided to
    investigate it carefully and see just what it really amounted
    to."</p>

    <p>Holton smiled a little wryly as she completed her
    explanation. "He's stayed here, studyin' it, a long time, ain't
    he?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," Miss Alathea answered. "When he once reached here he
    seemed to find new beauties in the country every day. He wrote
    us the most glowing letters of it, and these letters
    and&mdash;and&mdash;other things, decided me to come and see
    him and the property he is so fond of. The Colonel was polite
    enough to volunteer as escort, your daughter to come as a
    companion."</p>

    <p>Holton winked mysteriously at Colonel Doolittle. "You come
    at the right time," said he. "I'll have some things to tell you
    of this country and just what the railroad's going to do for it
    if you should care to listen."</p>

    <p>The Colonel's eyes, plainly those of one who read the tale
    of character upon the faces of the people whom he met, looked
    at him with no great favor, but he smiled. "We've already
    learned some things which have astonished us," he said. Then,
    though, despite the fact that his remark had greatly aroused
    Holton's curiosity, evidently, he changed the subject somewhat
    abruptly, and turned grandiosely to Miss 'Lethe.</p>

    <p>"May I offuh you my ahm, ma'am, for a little stroll about
    heah?" he inquired. "The greatest disadvantage which I see
    about this country is the lack of level places big enough to
    put a race-track in, ma'am. So far as I can see from lookin'
    round me, casual like, you couldn't run a quahtuh, heah,
    without eitheh goin' up a hill or comin' down one."</p>

    <p>"<i>Isn't</i> it rough!" said Barbara, with a gesture of
    aversion which seemed a bit affected.</p>

    <p>Holton looked at her with what was plainly admiration. It
    was clear enough that, in a way, he was fond of his showy
    daughter. He ran his eye with satisfaction over her costume,
    from head to foot, and nodded.</p>

    <p>"You ain't never seen much of rough life, now have you,
    Barbara?" He turned, then, to Miss Alathea. "These young folks,
    raised the way we raise 'em, nowadays, get thinkin' that the
    whole world has been smoothed out for their treadin'&mdash;an'
    they ain't far wrong. We <i>do</i> smooth out the world for
    'em. Now, there's your nephew, Frank; he&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh, he <i>likes</i> it, here, as I have said," she
    answered.</p>

    <p>"But it is so&mdash;<i>uncouth</i>" said Barbara, plainly
    for the benefit of one or two admiring youths from the
    surveying party, who were standing near. "And some of the
    people look so absolutely vicious&mdash;some of the natives, I
    mean, of course, you know. Now look at that young fellow, over
    there!"</p>

    <p>The girl had nodded toward Joe Lorey, who was standing not
    far off, observing them with an unwavering and disapproving,
    almost definitely hostile stare.</p>

    <p>"He looks," the girl went on, "as if he hated us and would
    be glad to do us harm. So violent!"</p>

    <p>"He's from up the mountains," one of the young engineers
    said, glancing toward him. "It's funny how those mountain
    people <i>all</i> hate us. You see, they say, the hills around
    about here are all full of moonshiners and they believe the
    coming of the railroad will bring with it law and order and
    that when that comes, of course, their living will be
    gone."</p>

    <p>"Moonshiners?" said Barbara. "Pray, what are
    moonshiners?"</p>

    <p>Her father grimly smiled again. He knew that she knew quite
    as well what moonshiners were as any person in the group, but
    her affected ignorance of rough things and rough men amused
    him.</p>

    <p>"Distillers of corn whisky who refuse to pay their taxes to
    the government," the youth replied. "The revenue officials have
    had dreadful times with them, here in the Cumberland, for
    years. Sometimes they have really bloody battles with them,
    when they try to make a raid."</p>

    <p>"How terrible!" said Barbara, and shuddered carefully. She
    looked again at Lorey, who, conscious that he was the subject
    of their conversation and resentful of it, stared back boldly
    and defiantly. "And do you think that he&mdash;that very young
    man there&mdash;can possibly have ever actually <i>killed</i> a
    man?"</p>

    <p>The engineer laughed heartily. "That he may <i>possibly</i>
    have killed a man," said he, "there is no doubt. I don't know
    that he has, however, and it is most improbable. I don't even
    know that he's a moonshiner."</p>

    <p>Among the others who had left the train, which, now, had
    been switched off to a crude side-track, the cars left there
    and the locomotive started at the handling of dirt-dump-cars,
    were two tall, sunburned strangers, whom Miss Alathea, who had
    noted them as she did everyone, had classed as engineers or
    surveyors, but who had not, when they had arrived, mingled with
    the other men employed on the construction of the railroad.
    While the young man and Barbara were talking about moonshiners,
    one of them had drifted near and he gave them a keen glance at
    the first mention of the word. Now he turned, but turned most
    casually, to follow with his own, their glances at Joe Lorey.
    Then he sauntered off, and, as he passed Holton, seemed to
    exchange meaning glances with him.</p>

    <p>Soon afterward Lorey turned away. The day was getting on
    toward noon. The long tramp back to his lonely cabin in the
    mountains would consume some hours. The sight of all these
    strangers, all this work on the new railroad worried him, made
    him unhappy, added to and multiplied the apprehension which for
    weeks had filled his heart about Madge Brierly and young
    Layson. He battled with a mixture of emotions. There was no
    ounce of cowardice, in Joe. Never had he met a situation in his
    life before which he had feared or which had proved too strong
    for him. All his battles, so far, and they had been many and
    been various, as was inevitable from the nature of his secret
    calling, had resulted in full victories for his mighty strength
    of body or his quick foot, certain hand, keen knowledge of the
    mountains and the woods resource and wit that went with these;
    but now things seemed to baffle him. His soul was struggling
    against acknowledgment of it, while his mind continually told
    him it was true. Everything seemed, now, to be against him.</p>

    <p>He knew, but would not admit, even to himself, that the
    march of progress must inevitably drive out of existence the
    still hidden in his cave and make the marketing of its illicit
    product doubly hazardous, nay, quite impossible. He knew that
    he must give it up; he realized that real good sense would send
    him home, that day, to bury the last trace of it in some spot
    where it never could be found again. But his stubborn soul
    revolted at the thought of being beaten, finally, by this
    civilization which he hated; he would not admit, even in his
    mind, that it had bested him, or could ever best him. He ground
    his teeth and pressed his elbow down against the stock of his
    long rifle with a force which ground the gun into his side
    until it hurt him. He would never give up, never! Let them try
    to get him if they could, these lowlanders! He would not be
    afraid of them. His father had not been&mdash;and he would
    never be.</p>

    <p>And there was a voice within him which kept whispering as
    did the one which counselled the abandonment of his illegal
    calling, the abandonment of that other effort, infinitely
    dearer to him, to win Madge Brierly's love and hand in
    marriage. His common-sense assured him that she was not made
    for such as he, that, while she had been born there in the
    mountains there were delicacies, refinements in her which would
    make her mating with his rude and uncouth strength impossible,
    would make it cruelly unhappy for her, even should it come
    about. But this voice he steadfastly declined to listen to,
    even more emphatically than he did to that which counselled
    caution in his calling. Again he ground his teeth. His heels,
    when they came down upon the rocky mountain trails up which he
    soon was climbing, fell on the slopes so heavily that,
    constantly, his progress was followed by the rattle of small
    stones down the inclined path behind him, constant little
    landslides. And, at ordinary times, Joe Lorey, awkward as he
    looked to be, could scale a sloping sand-bank without sending
    down a sliding spoonful to betray the fact that he was moving
    on it to the wild things it might startle.</p>

    <p>Heavily he resolved within his soul, against his own best
    judgment, to keep up both fights and win.</p>

    <p>The dynamite which he had stolen and which nestled in his
    game-sack comforted him, although he did not know how he would
    use it. Many times, as he worked through the narrow trails,
    jumped from stepping-stone to stepping-stone in crossing
    mountain-streams, pulled himself up steep and rocky slopes by
    clutching swaying branches, or rough-angled boulders, he let
    his left hand slip down to the side of the old game-sack,
    where, through the soft leather, he could plainly feel the
    smooth, terrific cylinder.</p>

    <p>He swore a mighty mountain oath that none of the advancing
    forces ever should win victory of him. If the revenuers ever
    tried to get him, let God help them, for they would need help;
    if Frank Layson stole his girl from him, then let God help him,
    also, for even more than would the revenuers the young
    bluegrass gentleman would need assistance from some mighty
    power.</p>

    <p>But a fate was closing on Joe Lorey which all his uncouth
    strength could not avert. As he had left the railway those two
    men whom simple-minded Miss Alathea had supposed were
    engineers, but who had not mingled with the throng of railway
    builders had looked at Horace Holton for confirmation of their
    guess. In a quick glance, so keen that they could not mistake
    its meaning so instantaneous that none else could suspect that
    the three men were even casual acquaintances, he had told them
    they had guessed aright.</p>

    <p>They sauntered off and disappeared in the direction whence
    the mountaineer had gone, and, though his feet were well
    accustomed to the trails and were as expert in their climbing
    as any mountaineer's for miles, these men proved more expert;
    though his ear was as acute as a wild animal's, so silently
    they moved that never once a hint that they were following,
    ever following behind him, reached it; their endurance was as
    great as his, their woods-craft was as sly as his.</p>

    <p>A fate was closing on Joe Lorey. The march of civilization
    was, indeed, advancing toward his mountain fastnesses at last.
    And nothing stays the march of civilization.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2><br>


    <p>The afternoon was waning as Joe climbed a sudden rise and
    saw before him Layson's camp.</p>

    <p>Through a cleft in the guardian range the sun's rays
    penetrated red and fiery. Already the quick chill of the coming
    evening had begun to permeate the air. A hawk, sailing from a
    day of foraging among the hen-yards of the distant valley, flew
    heavily across the sky, burdened with plunder for its little
    ones, nested at the top of a black stub on the mountain-side.
    Squirrels were home-going after a busy day among the trees. The
    mournful barking of young foxes, anxious for their dinners,
    thrilled the air with sounds of woe. Among the smaller birds
    the early nesters were already twittering in minor among the
    trees and thickets; a mountain-eagle cleft the air in the
    hawk's trail, so high that only a keen eye could have caught
    sight of him. Daylight insects were beginning to abate their
    clamor, while their fellows of the night were tuning for the
    evening concert. Mournfully, and very faintly, came a
    locomotive's wail from the far valley.</p>

    <p>Joe Lorey paused grimly in his progress to stare at the
    rough shack which housed the man he hated. He was no coward,
    and he would not take advantage of the loneliness and isolation
    of the spot to do him harm surreptitiously, but vividly the
    thought thrilled through him that someday he would assail him.
    Smoke was curling from the mud-and-stick chimney of the little
    structure, and he smiled contemptuously as he thought of how
    the bluegrass youth was doubtless pottering, within, getting
    ready to go down into the valley to greet his fine friends and
    be greeted. He had no doubt that long ere this the aged negro
    had reached him with the news of their arrival. He wondered,
    with a fierce leap of hope, if, possibly, their coming might
    not be the signal for the man's departure from the country
    where he was not wanted.</p>

    <p>This hope keenly thrilled him, for a moment, but, an instant
    later, when, through the small window, he saw the youth seat
    himself, alone, before a blazing fire of logs, stretch out his
    legs and lounge in the comfort of the blaze, it left him. He
    wondered if Layson did not intend to go down at all to meet his
    friends.</p>

    <p>Just then his quick ear caught the sound of stumbling,
    hurried footsteps, plainly not a mountaineer's, down in the
    rough woodland, below. Instantly his muscles tautened,
    instantly he brought his rifle to position; but he soon let it
    fall again and smiled, perhaps, for the first time that
    day.</p>

    <p>"Lawsy! Lawsy!" he could hear a scared voice muttering.
    "Lawsy, I is los', fo' suah!"</p>

    <p>His smile broadened to a wide, malicious grin of
    satisfaction. The black messenger who had been started with the
    news, evidently had not fared well upon the way, and was, but
    now, arriving. "It's that nigger wanderin' around up hyar," he
    mused. And then: "I'm goin' to have some fun with him."</p>

    <p>Silently he slipped down the path by which he had so
    recently ascended, and, at a good distance from the cabin, but
    still well in advance of the unhappy negro, hid behind a rock,
    awaiting his approach.</p>

    <p>Old Neb, advancing, scared tremendously, was talking to
    himself in a loud, excited voice.</p>

    <p>"Oh, golly!" he exclaimed. "Dis am a pretty fix for a
    bluegrass cullud gemman! Dis am a pretty fix&mdash;los', los'
    up heah, in de midst of wolves an' painters!"</p>

    <p>Joe, from behind his rock, wailed mournfully in startling
    imitation of a panther's call.</p>

    <p>The darkey almost fell prone in his fright. "Name o'
    goodness!" he exclaimed. "Wha' dat? Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;dere's a
    painter, now!"</p>

    <p>Joe called again, more mournfully, more ominously than
    before.</p>

    <p>Neb's fright became a trembling panic. "Hit's a-comin'
    closer!" he exclaimed. "I feel as if de debbil's gwine ter git
    me!" He stooped and started on a crouching run directly toward
    the rock behind which Joe was hiding.</p>

    <p>As the old man would have passed, Joe jumped out from his
    ambush, and, bringing his right hand down heavily upon the
    darky's shoulder, emitted a wild scream, absolutely terrifying
    in its savage ferocity. With a howl Neb dropped upon his knees,
    praying in an ecstasy of fear.</p>

    <p>"Oh, good Mister Painter, good Mister Debbil&mdash;" he
    began.</p>

    <p>Inasmuch as he was not devoured upon the instant, he finally
    ventured to look up and Joe laughed loudly.</p>

    <p>So great was the relief of the old negro that he did not
    think of anger. A sickly smile spread slowly on his face. "De
    Lawd be praised!" he said. "Why, hit's a man!"</p>

    <p>"Reckon I am," said Joe. "Generally pass for one." Then,
    although he knew quite well just why the man had come, from
    whom, for whom, he asked sternly to confuse him: "What
    <i>you</i> doin' in these mountings?"</p>

    <p>"I's lookin' fo' my massa, young Marse Frank Layson, suh,"
    Neb answered timidly.</p>

    <p>"You needn't to go fur to find him," Lorey answered
    bitterly. "You needn't to go fur to find him."</p>

    <p>The old negro looked at him, puzzled and frightened by his
    grim tone and manner.</p>

    <p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;" he began. "Is it hereabouts he hunts
    fo' deer? He wrote home he was findin' good spo't in the
    mountains, huntin' deer."</p>

    <p>Joe's mouth twitched ominously, involuntarily. The mere
    presence of Old Neb, there, was another evidence of the great
    advantage, which, he began to feel with hopeless rage, the man
    who had stolen that thing from him which he prized most highly,
    had over him. The negro was his servant. Servants meant
    prosperity, prosperity meant power. Backwoodsman as he was, Joe
    Lorey knew that perfectly. His face gloomed in the
    twilight.</p>

    <p>"Yes," he answered bitterly, "it's here he has been
    huntin'&mdash;huntin' deer&mdash;the pootiest deer these
    mountings ever see." Of course the old negro did not understand
    the man's allusion. He was puzzled by the speech; but Joe went
    on without an explanation: "But thar is danger in sech huntin'.
    Your young master, maybe, better keep a lookout for
    his-self!"</p>

    <p>His voice trembled with intensity.</p>

    <p>In the meantime Layson was still seated thoughtfully before
    his fire of crackling "down-wood," busy with a thousand
    speculations. Just what Madge Brierly, the little mountain
    girl, meant to him, really, he could not quite determine. He
    knew that he had been most powerfully attracted to her, but he
    did not fail to recognize the incongruity of such a situation.
    He had never been a youth of many love-affairs. Perhaps his
    regard for horses and the "sport of kings" had kept him from
    much travelling along the sentimental paths of dalliance with
    the fair sex. Barbara Holton, back in the bluegrass country,
    had been almost the only girl whom he had ever thought,
    seriously, of marrying, and he had not, actually, spoken, yet,
    to her about it. When he had left the lowlands for the
    mountains he had meant to, though, when he returned. There were
    those, he thought, who believed them an affianced couple. Now
    he wondered if they ever would be, really, and if, without
    actually speaking, he had not led her to believe that he would
    speak. He was astonished at the thrill of actual fear he felt
    as he considered the mere possibility of this.</p>

    <p>The news which had been brought to him by mail that upon the
    morrow he would see the girl again, in company with his Aunt
    and Colonel Doolittle, had focussed matters in his mind. Did he
    really love the haughty, bluegrass beauty? He was far from sure
    of it, as he sat there in the little mountain-cabin, although
    he had been certain that he did when he had left the
    lowlands.</p>

    <p>It seemed almost absurd, even to his young and sentimental
    mind, that one in his position should have lost his heart to an
    uneducated girl like Madge, but he definitely decided that, at
    any rate, he had never loved the other girl. If it was not
    really love he felt for the small maiden of the forest-fire and
    spelling-book, it surely was not love he felt for the
    brilliant, showy, bluegrass girl.</p>

    <p>He was reflecting discontentedly that he did not know
    exactly what he felt or what he wanted, when he heard Joe
    Lorey's startling imitation of the panther's cry, outside, and,
    rising, presently, when careful listening revealed the fact
    that the less obtrusive sound of human voices followed what had
    seemed to be the weird, uncanny call of the wild-beast, he went
    to the door and opened it, so that he could better listen.</p>

    <p>Joe and the negro had not been in actual view of Layson's
    cabin, up to that time. A rocky corner, rising at the trail's
    side, had concealed it. Now they stepped around this and the
    lighted door and windows of the little structure stood out,
    despite increasing darkness, plainly in their view.</p>

    <p>Almost instantly old Neb recognized the silhouette of
    Layson's figure there against the fire-light from within.</p>

    <p>"Marse <i>Frank</i>!" he cried. "Marse <i>Frank!</i>"</p>

    <p>Layson, startled by the unexpected sound of the familiar
    voice there in the wilderness, rushed from the door, took Neb's
    trembling hand and led him to the cabin.</p>

    <p>"Neb, old Neb!" he cried. "By all that's wonderful! How did
    you get here alone? I thought you all were to come up
    to-morrow. Where is Aunt 'Lethe, and the Colonel,
    and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Neb, his troubles all forgotten as quickly as a child's,
    stood wringing his young master's hand with extravagant
    delight. Joe Lorey disappeared like a flitting shadow of the
    coming night.</p>

    <p>"Dey're all down at de railroad, suh," said Neb. "Dey're all
    down at de railroad. Got heah a day befo' dey t'ought dey
    would, suh, an' sent me on ahead to let you know. I been
    wanderin' aroun' fo' a long time a-tryin' fo' to fin' yo'. Dat
    teamster what gib me a lif', he tol' me dat de trail war cleah
    from whar he dropped me to yo' cabin, but I couldn't fin' it,
    suh, an' I got los'."</p>

    <p>"And the others all are waiting at the railroad for me? I
    was going down to meet them to-morrow."</p>

    <p>"Dey don't expect you till to-morrow, now, suh. Ev'rybody
    tol' 'em that you couldn't git dar till to-morrow. I reckon
    dey'll be com'fable. Fo'ty men was tryin' fo' to make 'em so
    when <i>I</i> lef." The old darky laughed. "Looked like dat dem
    chaps wat's layin' out dat railroad, dar, ain't seen a woman's
    face fo' yeahs an' yeahs, de way dey flocked aroun'. Ev'y tent
    in de destruction camp war at deir suhvice in five
    minutes."</p>

    <p>Frank was busy at the fire with frying-pan and bacon. The
    old negro was worn out. The young man disregarded his uneasy
    protests and made him sit in comfort while he cooked a supper
    for him.</p>

    <p>"So you got lost! Who finally set you straight? I heard you
    talking, there, with someone."</p>

    <p>"A young pusson, suh," said Neb, with dignity. Lorey had
    befriended him, he knew, at last; but he had scared him into
    panic to begin with. "A young pusson, suh," he said, "what made
    me think he was a paintuh, suh, to staht with. Made me think he
    was a paintuh, suh, or else de debbil, wid his howlin'."</p>

    <p>Layson laughed long and heartily. "Must have been Joe
    Lorey," he surmised. "I heard that cry and thought, myself, it
    was a panther. He's the only one on earth, I guess, who can
    imitate the beasts so well. Where is he, now?'</p>

    <p>"Lawd knows! I see him dar, close by me, den I seed you in
    de doah, an' when I looked aroun' ag'in, he had plumb faded
    clean away!"</p>

    <p>"They're wonderful, these mountaineers, with their
    woods-craft."</p>

    <p>"Debbil craf, mo' like," said Neb, a bit resentful,
    still.</p>

    <p>Frank smiled at the thought of his dear Aunt, precise and
    elegant, compelled to spend the night in a construction camp
    beneath white-canvas.</p>

    <p>"What did Aunt 'Lethe think about a night in tents?" he
    asked.</p>

    <p>"Lawd," said Neb, plainly trying to gather bravery for
    something which he wished to say, "I didn't ax huh. Too busy
    with my worryin'."</p>

    <p>"Worrying at what, Neb?"</p>

    <p>"Oveh dat Miss Holton an' her father."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Holton didn't come, too, did he?"</p>

    <p>"No; he didn't come wid us, suh; but he met us dar down by
    de railroad. Wasn't lookin' for him, an' I guess he wasn't
    lookin', jus' exactly, to see us. But he was dar an' now he's
    jus' a membuh of ouah pahty, suh, as good as Cunnel Doolittle.
    Hit don't seem right to me, suh; no suh, hit don't seem right
    to me."</p>

    <p>"Why, Neb!"</p>

    <p>"An' dat Miss Barbara! She was dead sot to see you, an' Miss
    'Lethe was compelled to ax her fo' to come along. She didn't
    mean to, fust off; no suh. But she had to, in de end. Den I war
    plumb beat when I saw Mister Holton stalkin' up dat platfohm
    like he owned it an' de railroad an' de hills, and de hull
    yearth. But he's bettuh heah dan down at home, Marse Frank. He
    don't <i>belong</i> down in de bluegrass."</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid you are impertinent, Neb. Don't meddle. You
    always have been prejudiced against Barbara and her
    father."</p>

    <p>The old negro answered quickly, bitterly. "I ain't likely to
    fuhgit," said he, "dat de only blow dat evuh fell upon my back
    was from his han'! I guess you rickollick as well as I do. He
    cotch me coon-huntin' on his place an' strung me up. He'd jes'
    skinned me dar alive if you-all hadn't heered my holler in' an'
    run in."</p>

    <p>Layson was uneasy at the turn the talk had taken. "That was
    years ago, Neb," he expostulated.</p>

    <p>"Don't seem yeahs ago to me, suh. Huh! De only blow dat evuh
    fell upon my back! But yo' snatched dat whip out of his ban'
    an' den yo' laid it, with ev'y ounce of stren'th war in yo',
    right acrost his face!"</p>

    <p>Layson, unwilling to be harsh with the old man and forbid
    him to say more, ostentatiously busied himself, now, about the
    table with the frying-pan and other dishes, hoping, thus, to
    discourage further talk of this sort.</p>

    <p>"No, suh," Neb went on with shaking head, "I jus' nachelly
    don' like him. Don't like <i>either</i> of 'em. An' he, Marse
    Frank, he nevuh <i>will</i> fuhgit dat blow, an' don't you
    think he will!"</p>

    <p>"That's all over, long ago," said Frank, as he put the
    finishing touches on the old man's supper. "And what had
    Barbara to do with it? She can't help what her father
    does."</p>

    <p>Neb drew up to the table with a continuously shaking head.
    For months he had desired to speak his mind to his young
    master, but had never dared to take so great a liberty. Now the
    unusual circumstances they were placed in, the fact that he had
    been lost in the mountains in his service and half scared to
    death, imbued him with new boldness.</p>

    <p>"She kain't he'p what he does, suh, no," said he. "But
    listen, now, Marse Frank, to po' ol' Neb. De pizen vine hit
    don't b'ar peaches, an' nightshade berries&mdash;dey ain't
    hulsome, eben ef dey're pooty."</p>

    <p>"Neb, stop that!" Layson commanded sharply.</p>

    <p>The old negro half slipped from the chair in which he had
    been sitting wearily. Once he had started on the speech which
    he had made his mind up, months ago, that, some day, he would
    screw his courage up to, he would not be stopped.</p>

    <p>"Oh, honey," he exclaimed, holding out his tremulous old
    hands in a gesture of appeal, while the fire-light flickered on
    a face on which affection and real sincerity were plain, "I's
    watched ovuh you evuh sence yo' wuh a baby, an' when I see dat
    han'some face o' hers was drawin' of yo' on, it jus' nigh broke
    my ol' brack heaht, it did. It did, Marse Frank, fo' suah."</p>

    <p>The young man could not reprimand the aged negro. He knew
    that all he said came from the heart, a heart as utterly
    unselfish and devoted in its love as human heart could be.</p>

    <p>"Oh, pshaw, Neb!" he said soothingly. "Don't worry. Perhaps
    I did go just a bit too far with Barbara&mdash;young folks, you
    know!&mdash;but that's all over, now." Again he wondered most
    uncomfortably if this were really true, again his mind made its
    comparisons between the bluegrass girl and sweet Madge Brierly.
    "There's no danger that Woodlawn will have any other mistress
    than my dear Aunt 'Lethe for many a long year," he concluded
    rather lamely.</p>

    <p>The emotion of the ancient darky worried him. It was proof
    that evidence of a love affair with Barbara Holton had been
    plain to every eye, he thought.</p>

    <p>Neb now slid wholly from the chair and dropped upon his
    knees close by the youth he loved, grasping his hand and
    pressing it against his faithful heart.</p>

    <p>"Oh, praise de Lawd, Marse Frank; oh, praise de Lawd!" he
    cried.</p>

    <p>Old Neb slept with an easier heart, that night, than had
    throbbed in his old black bosom since the probability that
    Barbara Holton would be a member of the party which was to
    visit his young master in the mountains, had first begun to
    worry him. But long after he had found unconsciousness on the
    boughs-and-blanket bed which he had fashioned for himself under
    Frank's direction, Layson, himself, was wandering beneath the
    stars, thinking of the problem that beset him.</p>

    <p>He was sorry Barbara was coming to the mountains. Why had
    his Aunt 'Lethe brought her? What would that dear lady think
    about Madge Brierly, wood-nymph, rustic phenomenon? What had
    Horace Holton been doing in the mountains, secretly, to have
    been surprised, discomfited as Neb had said he was, at sight of
    the Colonel, Miss 'Lethe and his daughter?</p>

    <p>But before he had finished the pipe which he had carried
    into the crisp air of the sharp mountain night for company, his
    thought had left the Holtons and were seeking (as they almost
    always were, these days and nights), his little pupil of the
    spelling-book, his little burden of the brush-fire flight. He
    looked across the mountain-side toward where her lonely cabin
    hid in its secluded fastness. There was a late light to-night
    ashine from its small window.</p>

    <p>"She'll like her," he murmured softly in the night. "She'll
    <i>love</i> her. Aunt 'Lethe'll understand!"</p>

    <p>And then he wondered just exactly what it was that he felt
    so very certain his Aunt 'Lethe would be sure to understand. He
    did not understand, himself, precisely what had happened to
    him, his life-plans, heart-longings.</p>

    <p>Strolling there beneath the stars he gave no thought to poor
    Joe Lorey, until, like a night-shadow, the moonshiner stalked
    along the trail and passed him. Layson called to him
    good-naturedly, but the mountaineer gave him no heed. Frank
    stood, gazing after him in the soft darkness, in amazement.
    Then a quick, suspicious thrill shot through him. The man was
    bound up the steep trail toward Madge's cabin. Presently he
    heard him calling. He went slowly up the trail, himself.</p>

    <p>The girl came quickly from her cabin in answer to the
    shouting of the mountaineer.</p>

    <p>"What is it, Joe?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"I want a word with you. I've come a purpose," Lorey
    answered sullenly.</p>

    <p>The girl was almost frightened by his manner. She had never
    seen him in this mood; he had never come to her, alone, at
    night, before. "Well, Joe, you'll have to wait," said she.
    "I've got some things to do, to-night." Her sewing was not yet
    half finished.</p>

    <p>Standing on her little bridge, she held with one hand to the
    worn old rope by means of which she presently would pull it up.
    She did not take Joe very seriously; in the darkness she could
    not see the grim expression of his brow, the firm set of his
    jaw, the clenched hands, one of which was pressed against the
    game sack with his powerful plunder hidden in it. She laughed
    and tried to joke, for, even though she did not guess how
    serious he was, her heart had told her that some day, ere long,
    there must of stern necessity be a full understanding between
    her and the mountaineer, and that he would go from her, after
    it, with a sore heart. In the past she had not wished to marry
    him, but she had never definitely said, even to herself, that
    such a thing was quite impossible for all time to come. Now she
    knew that this was so, although she would not acknowledge, even
    to herself, the actual reason for this certainty. No; she could
    never marry Joe. She hoped that, he would never again beg her
    to.</p>

    <p>"Come back some other time, when I ain't quite so busy," she
    said trying to speak jokingly. "Tomorrow, or nex' week, or
    Crismuss."</p>

    <p>He stood gazing at her sourly. "I'll come sooner," he said
    slowly. "Sooner. An' hark ye, Madge, if that thar foreigner
    comes in atween us, I'm goin' to spile his han'some face
    forever!"</p>

    <p>"What nonsense you do talk!" the girl exclaimed, but her
    heart sank with apprehension as the man stalked down the path.
    She did not pull the draw-bridge up, at once, but stood there,
    gazing after him, disturbed.</p>

    <p>Again he met Layson, still strolling slowly on the trail,
    busy with confusing thoughts, puffing at his pipe. The
    mountaineer did not call out a greeting, but stepped out of the
    trail, for Frank to pass, without a word.</p>

    <p>"Why, Joe," said Layson, "I didn't see you. How are you?" He
    held out his hand.</p>

    <p>The mountaineer said nothing for an instant, then he
    straightened to his lank full height and held his own hand
    close against his side. "No," he said, "I can't, I can't."</p>

    <p>Layson was astonished. He peered at him. "Why, Joe!" said
    he; and then: "See here&mdash;what have I ever done to
    you?"</p>

    <p>Joe turned on him quickly. "Done?" he cried. "Maybe nothin',
    maybe everythin'." He paused dramatically, unconscious of the
    fierce intentness of his gaze, the lithe aggressiveness of his
    posture. "But I warns you, now&mdash;you ain't our kind! Th'
    mountings ain't no place for you. The sooner you gits out of
    'em, the better it'll be fer you."</p>

    <p>Layson stood dumbfounded for a moment. Then he would have
    said some further word, but the mountaineer, his arm pressed
    tight against that old game-sack, stalked down the trail.
    Suddenly Layson understood.</p>

    <p>"Jealous, by Jove!" he said. "Jealous of little Madge!"
    Slowly he turned about, puffing fiercely at his pipe, his
    thoughts a compound of hot anger and compassion.</p>

    <p>Madge, filled with dread of what her disgruntled mountain
    suitor might be led to do by his black mood, had not yet
    re-crossed her draw-bridge, but was standing by it, listening
    intently, when she heard Layson's footsteps nearing. Her heart
    gave a great throb of real relief. She had not exactly feared
    that trouble really would come between the men, but&mdash;Lorey
    came of violent stock and his face had been dark and
    threatening.</p>

    <p>She saw Layson long before he knew that she was there.</p>

    <p>"Oh," she cried, relieved, "that you?"</p>

    <p>He hurried to her. "I thought you mountain people all went
    early to your beds," said he, and laughed, "but I met Joe Lorey
    on the trail and here you are, standing by your bridge,
    star-gazing."</p>

    <p>Of course she would not tell him of her worries. She took
    the loophole offered by his words and looked gravely up at the
    far, spangled sky. "Yes," said she, "they're mighty pretty,
    ain't they?"</p>

    <p>Layson was in abnormal mood. The prospect of his Aunt's
    arrival, the certainty that something more than he had thought
    had come out of his mountain sojourn, the fact that he was sure
    that he regretted Barbara Holton's coming, old Neb's arrival,
    and his raking up of ancient scores against the lowland
    maiden's father, his meeting with Joe Lorey and the latter's
    treatment of him, had wrought him to a pitch of mild
    excitement. The girl looked most alluring as she stood there in
    the moonlight.</p>

    <p>"My friends are in the valley and are coming up to-morrow,"
    he said to her. "Do you know that this may be the last time I
    shall ever see you all alone?"</p>

    <p>She gasped. He had not hinted at a thing like that before.
    "You ain't going back with them, are you?" she asked, her voice
    a little tremulous from the shock of the surprise. "You ain't
    going back with them&mdash;never to come hyar no more, are
    you?"</p>

    <p>He stepped nearer to her. "Why, little one," he asked,
    "would you care?"</p>

    <p>"Care?" she said with thrilling voice, and then, gaining
    better self-control, tried to appear indifferent. "Why should
    I?" she said lightly. "I ain't nothin' to you and you ain't
    nothin' to me."</p>

    <p>His heart denied her words. "Don't say that!" he cried. "You
    don't know how dear you've grown to me." He stepped toward her
    with his arms outstretched. He almost reached her and he knew,
    and she knew, instinctively, that if he had he would have
    kissed her.</p><a name="Illus_3"></a> <br>

        <h4>"No man can cross this bridge,
        unless&mdash;unless,&mdash;"</h4>
    </center><br>
     <br>
    <br>


    <p>She shrank back like a startled fawn, when his foot was
    almost on the bridge that spanned the chasm between them and
    her cabin.</p>

    <p>"Don't you dare to touch me!" she said fiercely.</p>

    <p>She sped back upon the little bridge, and, when he would
    have followed, held her hand up with a gesture of such native
    dignity, offended womanhood, that he stopped where he was,
    abashed.</p>

    <p>"No&mdash;no, sir; you can't cross this bridge," said she.
    "No man ever can, unless&mdash;unless&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Almost sobbing, now, she left the sentence incomplete; and
    then: "Oh, you wouldn't dared act so to a bluegrass girl! But I
    know what's right as well as them. It don't take no
    book-learnin' to tell me as how a kiss like that you planned
    for me would be a sign that really you care for me no more than
    for the critters that you hunt an' kill for pastime up hyar
    among the mountings."</p>

    <p>He would have given much if he had never done the foolish
    thing. He stood there with lowered eyes, bent head, abashed,
    discomfited.</p>

    <p>"An' I 'lowed you were my friend!" said she.</p>

    <p>Now he looked up at her and spoke out impulsively: "And so I
    am, Madge, really! I was ... wrong. Forgive me!"</p>

    <p>She dropped her hands with a weary change of manner. "Well,
    I reckon I will," said she. "You've been too kind and good for
    me to bear a grudge ag'in you; but ... but ... Well, maybe I
    had better say good-night."</p>

    <p>She walked slowly back across the bridge without another
    word, pulled on its rope and raised it, made the rope fast and
    slowly disappeared within her little cabin.</p>

    <p>"Poor child!" said he, and turned away. "I was a brute to
    wound her."</p>

    <p>As he went down the trail, darkening, now, as the moon slid
    behind the towering mountain back of him, his heart was in a
    tumult. "After all," he reflected, "education isn't everything.
    All the culture in the world wouldn't make her more sincere and
    true. She has taught <i>me</i> a lesson I shan't soon
    forget."</p>

    <p>His thoughts turned, then, to the girl who would come up
    with the party on the following day.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;wonder! Was there ever, really, a time when I loved
    Barbara?... If so, that time has gone, now, never to
    return."</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2><br>


    <p>His visitors took Layson by surprise, next morning. They had
    started from the valley long before he had supposed they
    would.</p>

    <p>Holton saw him first and nudged his daughter, who was with
    him. They were well ahead of Miss Alathea and the Colonel, who
    had been unable to keep up with them upon the final sharp
    ascent of the foot-journey from the wagon-road. The old man
    grinned unpleasantly. He had rather vulgar manners, often
    annoying to his daughter, who had had all the advantages which,
    in his rough, mysterious youth, he had been denied.</p>

    <p>"Thar he is, Barb; thar he is," he said, not loudly. Miss
    Alathea and the Colonel, following close behind, were a
    restraint on him.</p>

    <p>The girl's face was full of eagerness as she saw the man
    they sought. He was busy polishing a gun, but that his thoughts
    were occupied with something less mechanical and not wholly
    pleasant the slight frown upon his face made evident. "Mr.
    Layson! Frank!" she cried.</p>

    <p>The young man turned, on hearing her, and hurried toward her
    and her father with his hands outstretched in welcome. He was
    not overjoyed to have the old man visit him, just then; he was
    even doubtful of the welcome which his heart had for the
    daughter; but he was a southerner and in the gentle-born
    southerner real hospitality is quite instinctive.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Holton&mdash;Barbara," said he. "I am delighted.
    Welcome to the mountains." He grasped their hands in hearty
    greeting. "But where are Aunt Alathea and the Colonel?"</p>

    <p>Holton tried to be as cordial as his host. That he was very
    anxious to appear agreeable was evident. "Oh, them slow-pokes?"
    he said, laughing. "We didn't wait for them. We pushed on
    ahead. We reckoned as you would be glad to see us."</p>

    <p>"And so I am."</p>

    <p>"One in particular, maybe," Holton answered, with a crude
    attempt at badinage. He glanced archly from the young man to
    his daughter.</p>

    <p>"Father!" she exclaimed, a bit annoyed, and yet not too
    unwilling that the fact that she and Layson were acknowledged
    sweethearts should be at once established.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I ain't been blind," said Holton, gaily, going much
    farther than she wished him to. "I've cut <i>my</i>
    eye-teeth!"</p>

    <p>Then he turned to Layson with an awkward lightness. "Barbara
    told me what passed between you two young folks afore you come
    up to the mountings," he explained. And then, with further
    elephantine airyness: "I say, jest excuse me&mdash;reckon I'm
    in the way." He made a move as if to hurry off.</p>

    <p>Layson was not pleased. The old man was annoying, always,
    and now, after the long revery of the night before about Madge
    Brierly, this attitude was doubly disconcerting. "Not at all,
    Mr. Holton," he said, somewhat hastily. "I'm sure we'd rather
    you'd remain. Are you sure the others are all right?"</p>

    <p>"Close behind us."</p>

    <p>"I'll go and make sure that they do not lose their way."</p>

    <p>Holton looked at his daughter in a blank dismay after the
    youth had started down the hill. "I say, gal," said he,
    "there's somethin' wrong here!"</p>

    <p>She was inclined to blame him for the deep discomforture she
    felt. "Why couldn't you let us alone?" she answered angrily.
    "You've spoiled everything!"</p>

    <p>The old man looked at her, with worry on his face. "Didn't
    you tell me 't was as good as settled? You said you were dead
    sure he meant to make you his wife."</p>

    <p>She was still petulant, blaming him for Layson's unexpected
    lack of warmth. "Yes, but you needn't have interfered!"</p>

    <p>Holton was intensely puzzled, worried, almost frightened. He
    was as anxious to have this young man for a son-in-law as his
    daughter was to have him for a husband. Her marriage into such
    a celebrated bluegrass family as the Laysons were, would firmly
    fix her social status, no matter how precarious it might be
    now, and the match would be of great advantage to him in a
    business way, as well. He stood there, thinking deeply, very
    much displeased.</p>

    <p>"There's somethin' more nor me has come between you," he
    said finally, his face flushing with a deep resentment. "I tell
    you, gal, what I believed at first, deep in my heart, air true.
    He was only triflin' with you. Them aristocrats down in the
    bluegrass don't hold us no better than the dust beneath their
    feet, even if we have got money. It's <i>family</i> that counts
    with them. Didn't he lay his whip acrost my face, once, as if I
    was a nigger?" His wrath was rising. "And now he shows that he
    was only triflin' with you with no real intentions of doin' as
    we thought he would!" The man was tremulous with wrath. "Oh,
    I'll be even with him!"</p>

    <p>Barbara was greatly worried by the situation. All her life,
    despite the fact that she was beautiful, despite the fact that
    her father was a rich man&mdash;richer, by a dozen times, than
    many of the people for whose friendship she longed
    vainly&mdash;she had vaguely felt that there was an invisible
    gulf between her and the girls with whom she came in contact at
    the exclusive schools to which she had been sent, between her
    and the gentlefolk with whom, in some measure, she had mixed
    since she had left school-walls. "Father," she asked anxiously,
    "why do people look down on us so?"</p>

    <p>He faced her with a worried look, as if he feared that she
    might guess at something which he wished should remain hidden.
    "They say I made my money tradin' in niggers," he replied, at
    length. "Well, what of it? Didn't I have the right?"</p>

    <p>"Are you sure there's nothing else?"</p>

    <p>He seemed definitely startled. "Girl, what makes you
    ask?"</p>

    <p>"Because sometimes memories come to me."</p>

    <p>"Memories of what?"</p>

    <p>"Of&mdash;my childhood," she said slowly, "of passes among
    mountains&mdash;mountains much like these."</p>

    <p>He regarded her uneasily. "Oh, sho, gal!" he exclaimed,
    trying to make light of it. "Reckon you've been dreamin'. You
    were never hyar before."</p>

    <p>But she looked about her, unconvinced, and, when she spoke,
    spoke slowly, evidently trying to recall with definite clarity
    certain things which flitted through her mind as vague
    impressions only. "Why does everything seem so familiar, here,
    then, as if I had just wakened in my true surroundings after a
    long sleep in which I had had dreams?" There was, suddenly, a
    definite accusation in her eyes. "Father, you are trying to
    deceive me! I was once a child, here in these very mountains!"
    She stared about intently.</p>

    <p>The speech had an amazing effect on the old man. He stepped
    close to her. "Hush!" said he, imperatively. "Don't you dare
    speak such a word ag'in!"</p>

    <p>She peered into his eyes. "There <i>is</i> a secret, then!
    We lived here, long ago!"</p>

    <p>"Stop, I tell you!" he commanded. "Don't hint at such
    things, for your life." He dropped his voice to hoarse whisper.
    "Suppose I did live hyar, once. I was a smooth-faced youngster,
    then; my own mother wouldn't know me, now."</p>

    <p>The sound of voices coming up the mountain-trail interrupted
    the dramatic scene.</p>

    <p>"Sh!" said he. "They're comin'!"</p>

    <p>Frank was piloting his Aunt and Colonel Doolittle. "This
    way, Aunt 'Lethe," they could hear him say.</p>

    <p>An instant later he appeared, leading the way up the steep
    trail. His Aunt, Neb and the Colonel followed him.</p>

    <p>"Now, Aunt 'Lethe," he said gaily, "you can rest at last.
    Colonel, I can welcome you in earnest. This is, indeed, a
    pleasure."</p>

    <p>The Colonel was puffing fiercely from the hard work of the
    climb, but his broad face glowed with pleasure. He took a long,
    full breath of the exhilerating mountain air. "Pleasure? It's a
    derby-day, sir, metaphorically speaking." As he rested he eyed
    the youngster with approval. "Frank," said he, "you've grown to
    be the very image of my old friend, Judge Layson. Ah, five
    years have made their changes in us all&mdash;except Miss
    'Lethe." He bowed gallantly in her direction, and she gaily
    answered the salute.</p>

    <p>Barbara advanced, enthusiastically, looking at the Colonel
    with arch envy in her eyes. "Five years you've been in Europe,
    surrounded by the nobility. Oh, Colonel, what happiness!"</p>

    <p>He shook his head. "Happiness away from old Kentucky,
    surrounded by a lot of numb-skulls who couldn't mix a fancy
    drink to save their lives, who know nothing of that prismatic,
    rainbow-hued fountain of youth, a mint-julep? Ah!"</p>

    <p>"But, Colonel," said the girl, "the masterpieces of
    art!"</p>

    <p>"Give me," said he, "the masterpieces of Mother
    Nature&mdash;the bright-eyed, rose-cheeked, cherry-lipped girls
    of old Kentucky!"</p>

    <p>There was a general laugh. The Colonel's gallantry was
    ever-blooming. Frank applauded and the ladies bowed.</p>

    <p>"By the way, Frank," said the Colonel, after they had been
    made comfortable in a merry group before the cabin-door, "where
    is that particular masterpiece of Nature which you've written
    us so much about? Where is the&mdash;Diana?"</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea smiled at her somewhat worried nephew. "The
    'phenomenon,'" said she.</p>

    <p>"According to Neb, who told us of her as we worked up that
    steep trail," said Barbara, "the 'deer.'" She laughed, not too
    good naturedly Neb, who was standing waiting orders near,
    grinned broadly.</p>

    <p>"Neb, you rascal!" exclaimed Frank.</p>

    <p>"Come, where is she, Frank; where is she?" asked the
    Colonel.</p>

    <p>The youth was not too much embarrassed, but he gave a quick,
    side-glance at Barbara. "She is probably getting ready to
    receive you," he replied. "I told her I expected you and she's
    been very much excited over it."</p>

    <p>"Adding to nature's charms the mysteries of art," the
    Colonel said, approvingly. "We shall expect to be overwhelmed.
    And, meantime, while we're waiting, we might as well explain to
    you the business which has brought us up here."</p>

    <p>His face showed him to be the bearer of good news. He rose,
    excitedly, and went to Frank, to put his hand upon his
    shoulder. "Now, my boy, keep cool, keep cool! I tell you,
    Frank, it's the biggest thing out. It'll make a millionaire of
    you as sure as Fate before the next five years have
    passed!"</p>

    <p>Layson was taken wholly by surprise. No one had in the least
    prepared him for anything of this sort. He had supposed the
    party had come up to see him merely for the pleasure of the
    trip. "I don't understand," said he.</p>

    <p>"Keep cool, keep cool!" the Colonel urged. "It is colossal,
    metaphorically. You see, I was over there in Europe, promoting
    a South American mine, when I happened to see in a Kentucky
    paper that the Georgetown Midland was to be put through these
    mountains near the land your father bought. That land, my boy,
    is rich in coal and iron!"</p>

    <p>The young man's face shone with delight. "He always said
    so!" he exclaimed. "I meant, sometime, to investigate."</p>

    <p>"I've saved you the trouble. I came back on the next
    steamer, organized a syndicate in New York City, sent an expert
    out to carefully look into things, and, on his report, a
    company is willing to put in a $200,000 plant to develop your
    land. All you've got to do is to take $25,000 worth of stock
    and let your coal-land stand for as much more."</p>

    <p>The youth's face fell. "Twenty-five thousand dollars!" he
    exclaimed. "Why, Colonel, I have not one fifth of it!"</p>

    <p>"Ah," said the Colonel, smiling, "but here, like a good
    angel, comes in your dear Aunt 'Lethe!" He smiled at her.
    "Isn't it so, Miss 'Lethe?"</p>

    <p>Frank spoke up quickly. "Surely," he exclaimed to her as she
    advanced toward him, with smiles, "you know I'd never take your
    money!"</p>

    <p>"You must, Frank," she insisted. "The Colonel says it is the
    chance of a lifetime."</p>

    <p>"Why, Auntie, it's your whole fortune. I wouldn't risk
    it."</p>

    <p>"But you could pay it all back in a month."</p>

    <p>"How?" he asked, not understanding in the least.</p>

    <p>"By selling Queen Bess."</p>

    <p>He flinched. The thought had not occurred to him. "Sell
    Queen Bess!" said he. "The prettiest, the fastest mare in all
    Kentucky! Never!"</p>

    <p>"My boy," said the Colonel, "the odds are far too
    heavy&mdash;a million against the mare. You can't stand
    'em."</p>

    <p>"Oh, Frank," said his Aunt, impulsively, "if you'll only
    take the money and give up racing!"</p>

    <p>He laughed. Miss Alathea's strong prejudice against the
    race-tracks was proverbial. "So that's what you're after!" he
    exclaimed. "You dear old schemer!"</p>

    <p>"With your impulsive, generous nature, racing is sure to
    ruin you."</p>

    <p>The Colonel looked first at Frank with ardent sympathy aglow
    in his eyes; then, after a hasty glance at Miss Alathea, he
    quickly changed the meaning of his look and spoke
    admonishingly. "The voice of wisdom!" he exclaimed. "Ah, Frank,
    from what I hear I judge you're too much of a
    plunger&mdash;like a young fellow I once knew who thought he
    could win a fortune on the race-track." He began, now, to speak
    very seriously. "He was in love with the prettiest and sweetest
    girl in old Kentucky, but he wished to wait till he could get
    that fortune, and he chased it here and there, looking for it
    mostly on the race-tracks, until he had more grey hairs than he
    had ever hoped to have dollars; he chased it till his dream of
    happiness had slipped by, perhaps forever. My boy, the
    race-track is a delusion and a snare."</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea looked at him with pleased surprise. "Colonel,
    your sentiments astonish and delight me."</p>

    <p>"How can you refuse," the Colonel said, "when such a woman
    asks? For one who loves you, you should give those pleasures up
    without a pang."</p>

    <p>In the pause that followed he reflected on the history of
    the youth to whom he had referred, for that young man was
    himself. He had loved Miss Alathea twenty years, but the
    Goddess Chance had kept him, all that time, too poor to ask her
    hand in marriage. His heart beat with elation as he realized
    that, possibly, the scheme which he had come there to the
    mountains to propose to Frank, might remedy the evils of the
    situation.</p>

    <p>Frank had been thinking deeply. "But what certainty is
    there," he inquired, "that I can sell Queen Bess at such a
    price?"</p>

    <p>Now the Colonel spoke with animation. "Absolute. I've a
    written offer from the Dyer brothers to take her for
    twenty-five thousand dollars, if she is delivered, safe and
    sound, on the morning she's to run in the Ashland Oaks. It's a
    dead sure thing, my boy. You can't refuse."</p>

    <p>The young man hesitated, still. "I'll investigate,
    and&mdash;well, I'll see." He walked away, deep in thought.</p>

    <p>The Colonel turned from him to Miss Alathea. "Miss 'Lethe,
    congratulate yourself. The victory is won."</p>

    <p>Frank turned upon his heel and spoke to Holton. "What do you
    think of this investment?" he inquired.</p>

    <p>"Wal," said Holton, "I think it's a blamed good thing. I'd
    only like the chance to go into it, myself." He went closer to
    the youth and spoke in an instinctively low tone. "By the way,
    this gal, hyar, Madge Brierly, owns fifty acres o' land down
    there in the valley, that's bound to be wuth money. Like
    enough, with your help, I could buy it for a song. I'll make it
    all right with you. What do you say? Is it a bargain, Layson?"
    He held out his hand, evidently with no thought but that the
    questionable offer would be snapped up at once.</p>

    <p>Layson drew back angrily. "No," he replied.</p>

    <p>Holton, seeing that he had made a serious mistake, tried to
    correct it. "Oh, shucks, now! I didn't mean no harm. That's
    only business."</p>

    <p>Layson was intensely angered. "I won't waste words on you,"
    he said, "but think twice before you make me such a proposition
    again."</p>

    <p>Holton's wrath rose vividly. "Damn him!" he muttered as he
    walked away. "I'll pay him back for that! I'll get that gal's
    land in spite of him, and I won't stop at that. I'll pay him
    back for ... everythin'! I'll teach him what it air to stir the
    hate o' hell in a man's heart!"</p>

    <p>Barbara, distressed anew by this unpleasant episode, had
    started to go after him, when the weird cry of an owl, a long
    drawn, tremulous: "Hoo-oo-oo!" came from somewhere in the
    forest, close at hand. It startled her. "Heavens!" said she.
    "What's that?"</p>

    <p>Neb, who also had been startled at the first penetrating,
    weird call, bethought himself, now, and answered her: "It's de
    deah."</p>

    <p>"The phenomenon!" exclaimed Miss Alathea.</p>

    <p>"The Diana!" said the Colonel, looking at Frank slyly.</p>

    <p>"Yes; she's coming," Frank said gaily, and then, looking
    down the path, started violently. "Heavens, she's coming!"</p>

    <p>The Colonel, who also had looked down the path, hurriedly
    approached him, feigning worry. "Frank, I haven't got 'em
    again, have I?"</p>

    <p>Madge approached them slowly in the quaint, old-fashioned
    costume she had resurrected from the chests of her dead
    mother's finery and re-made, very crudely, in accordance with
    the fashion-plates which she had found down at the cross-roads
    store. The result of her contriving was a startling mixture of
    fashions widely separated as to periods. Her untutored taste
    had mixed colors clashingly. Her unskilled fingers had sewed
    very bunchy seams.</p>

    <p>The girl was much embarrassed: it required the last ounce of
    her bravery to advance. Before she actually reached the little
    group, she half hid, indeed, behind a tree. It was from this
    shelter that she called her greeting: "Howdy, folks,
    howdy!"</p>

    <p>Frank went toward her with an outstretched hand. "Come,
    Madge," said he, encouragingly.</p>

    <p>"Reckon I'll have to," she assented, with a bashful smile
    and took a step or two reluctantly. But she had never seen folk
    dressed at all as were these visitors from the famed bluegrass,
    and her courage again faltered. Instantly she realized how
    wholly her own efforts to be elegant had failed. She hung back
    awkwardly, pathetically.</p>

    <p>"Don't be nervous, Madge; just be yourself," Frank urged
    her.</p>

    <p>"Free and easy? Well, I'll try; but I'm skeered enough to
    make me wild and reckless."</p>

    <p>Frank led her forward, while she made a mighty effort to
    accept the situation coolly. "These are my friends, Madge. Let
    me introduce you."</p>

    <p>She got some grip upon herself and smiled. "Ain't no need.
    Know 'em all by your prescription." With a mighty effort she
    approached the Colonel. "Colonel Sandusky Doolittle,
    howdy!"</p>

    <p>The Colonel was delighted. Her knowledge of his name was
    flattering. He had forgotten her strange costume the moment his
    glance had caught her wonderful, deep eyes. "Howdy, howdy!" he
    said heartily, shaking her hand vigorously. "Why, this is real
    Kentucky style!" It won't take <i>us</i> long to get
    acquainted."</p>

    <p>"Know all about you now," she said. "Great hossman. Colonel,
    I'll have a race with you, sometime."</p>

    <p>"What, you ride?" said the delighted Colonel.</p>

    <p>"Ride! Dellaw!" said she, with, now, unembarrassed
    animation. The subject was that one, of all, which made her
    most quickly forget everything beside. "Why, me and my pony
    takes to racin' like a pig to carrots. Before he lamed himself,
    whenever th' boys heard us clatterin' down th' mounting, they
    laid to race us back. Away we went, then, clickity-clip, up th'
    hills and around th' curves&mdash;an' I allus won."</p>

    <p>The Colonel realized with a great joy that he had found a
    kindred spirit. "Shake again!" he said to her, after further
    most congenial talk, and then turned to Frank. "My boy, you're
    right. She <i>is</i> a phenomenon&mdash;a thoroughbred, even if
    she hasn't any pedigree."</p>

    <p>Up to this time the ladies had remained somewhat in the
    background, watching the young mountain girl as the Colonel
    drew her out.</p>

    <p>Madge now turned to Frank, but looked at Barbara. "Is that
    the young lady from the bluegrass?" The girl was hurt and
    really offended by the stranger's aloof manner. "Looks like she
    can't see common folks."</p>

    <p>"That is Miss Barbara." He led the mountain girl toward her.
    "Barbara, this is my friend&mdash;er&mdash;Madge." He was,
    himself, a little disconcerted.</p>

    <p>The maiden from the lowlands bowed, but said no word. For an
    instant Madge shrank back, but then she advanced with an
    unusual boldness. Her spirit was aroused.</p>

    <p>"Howdy, Miss Barbarous, howdy!" she exclaimed and held her
    hand out to the handsomely dressed girl.</p>

    <p>But Miss Barbara was annoyed by the whole happening. She
    felt that this uncultivated country girl was getting far too
    much attention. The child's unconscious pun upon her name
    infuriated her. She did not answer her, but raised a lorgnette
    and stared at her.</p>

    <p>Madge was ready with an instant sympathy. "Oh, that's why
    you couldn't see, poor thing! Spectacles at your age!" Whether
    she really thought this was the case, not even Frank could tell
    by looking at her.</p>

    <p>Miss Holton was incensed. The haughty treatment she had
    planned to, give the mountain girl had not had the results she
    had expected. "There's nothing whatever the matter with my
    eyes!" she exclaimed hastily.</p>

    <p>"Wouldn't think you'd need a machine to help you star-gaze
    at folks, then," said the mountain girl. "But maybe it's the
    fashion in the bluegrass."</p>

    <p>Frank hurried up with Holton, planning a diversion. "This is
    Mr. Holton, Madge."</p>

    <p>"Howdy, sir," said she, and then started in astonishment.
    "Ain't I seen your face before, sir?"</p>

    <p>"Wal, I reckon not," said Holton most uneasily. "I was never
    hyar in these hyar mountings afore."</p>

    <p>She stepped closer to him, gazing straight at his grey eyes.
    They seemed strangely to recall the very distant past, she knew
    not how. There were other things about him which seemed much
    more immediately familiar, although his more elaborate garb
    prevented her, for the moment, from recognizing him as the
    stranger with the hammer, who had, that day of the forest-fire,
    been tap-tapping on the rocks upon her pasture-land. "Your eyes
    seem to bring something back." She plainly paled. She knew that
    their suggestion was a dreadful one, but could not make it
    definite.</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea noted her agitation instantly, and hurried to
    her side. "Poor child, what is the matter?"</p>

    <p>Madge had regained control of her features, which, for an
    instant, had shown plain horror. "Tain't nothin', ma'am. It
    couldn't be. It's all over now." She smiled gratefully at Miss
    Alathea. "An' you're his aunt, ain't you? I'd know you for his
    kin, anywhere. Why, somehow, you remind me of my lost
    mother."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, my dear. You must be very lonely, up here all
    alone."</p>

    <p>"I am, sometimes," said the girl, "but I have lots of fun,
    too. The woods are full of friends. Th' birds an' squirrels
    ain't afraid o' me. They seem to think I'm a wild thing, like
    'em."</p>

    <p>"It's true," said Frank, with an admiring, cheering look at
    the little country girl. "Their confidence in her is
    wonderful."</p>

    <p>The bluegrass girl's annoyance was increasing. She had come
    up to the mountains thinking that, among such crude
    surroundings, her gowns and the undoubted beauty they adorned,
    would hold the center of the stage, and by contrast, hold
    Layson quite enthralled; but here, instead, was a brown-faced
    country maid in grotesque, homemade costume, attracting most of
    his attention. She was conscious that by showing her
    discomfiture she was not strengthening her own position, but
    she could not hide it, could not curb her tongue.</p>

    <p>"A rider of races," said she; "a tamer of animals! What
    accomplishments! Do you actually live here, all alone?"</p>

    <p>"Come," said Madge, determined to be pleasant, "and I'll
    show you." She led the bluegrass girl to a convenient point
    from which her cabin was in sight.</p>

    <p>"In that little hut!" said Barbara, not impressed as Madge
    had innocently thought she would be. "Shocking!"</p>

    <p>The girl was angered, now. "So sorry I didn't have your
    opinion afore! But, maybe, you wouldn't think it were so awful,
    if you knowed how 'twere I come to live there."</p>

    <p>Frank had written something of the poor girl's tragic story
    to his aunt. She was all interest. "Won't you tell us, please?"
    she asked.</p>

    <p>Holton seemed to show a strange disinclination to listen to
    the narrative. "Ain't got no time for stories," he objected.
    "Gettin' late."</p>

    <p>"We'll take time, then," said Frank.</p>

    <p>"Go on, little one," urged Colonel Doolittle. "We're
    listening."</p>

    <p>Impressed and touched by the sympathy in the horseman's tone
    and the interest in Miss Alathea's eyes, Madge told with even
    greater force and more effect than when she had related it to
    Layson the story of the tragedy which had robbed her at a blow
    of father and of mother, the black, dreadful tale of merciless
    assassination which had left her orphaned in the mountains. Her
    audience attended, spellbound, even the disgruntled and
    unsympathetic Barbara listening with unwilling fascination.
    Only Holton turned away, with a gesture of impatience. He
    plainly did not wish to waste time on the girl. Or was it that?
    He seemed to be uneasy as he walked to and fro upon the
    rock-ledge near them, whence, had he cared for it, he could
    have had a gorgeous view of mountain scenery. But, although he
    said, as plainly as he could without actual rudeness, that the
    girl and her sad tale of tragedy were not worth attention, he
    was not successful in his efforts wholly to refuse to listen to
    her.</p>

    <p>"Infamous!" said Miss Alathea, when the child had
    finished.</p>

    <p>"And that scoundrel has gone free!" exclaimed the Colonel,
    in disgust.</p>

    <p>"<i>That's</i> how I come to live alone, here," Madge went
    on, addressing Barbara, particularly. The girl had made her
    feel it necessary to offer some defense. "After my mammy died I
    didn't have no place to go, an' so I just stayed on here, an'
    th' bridge my daddy built for his protection I have kept for
    mine. Maybe he has told you of it." She indicated Frank. They
    nodded.</p>

    <p>"And nothing has been heard of the infernal traitor, all
    these years?" the Colonel asked.</p>

    <p>"He left the mountings when he found how folks was
    feelin'&mdash;they'd have shot him, like a dog, on sight. But
    it don't make no differ where he goes; it don't make a bit of
    differ where he goes."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean by that?" the Colonel asked, and as he
    spoke, Holton, suddenly intent, paused in his pacing of the
    ledge to listen.</p>

    <p>"I mean, no matter where he goes he'll have to pay for it,
    come soon, come late. Th' day air sure to come when Joe, Ben
    Lorey's son, 'll meet him face to face an' make him answer for
    his crime!"</p>

    <p>"God-speed to him!" exclaimed the Colonel, fervently.</p>

    <p>Madge, in a gesture full of drama, although quite
    unconscious, raised her head, looking off into the vastness of
    the mountains, her hands thrust straight down at her sides and
    clenched, her shoulders squared, her chest heaving with a
    mighty intake. The little mountain-girl, as she stood there,
    thrilling with her longing for revenge, with prayers that some
    day the sinner might be punished for his dreadful crime, made
    an impressive figure.</p>

    <p>"Come soon or late!" she sighed. "Come soon or late!"</p>

    <p>The party watched her, fascinated, till Holton took his
    daughter's arm and urged her, uneasily, out of the little
    group.</p>

    <p>Later Madge asked the Colonel to go with her to the pasture
    lot and take a look at Little Hawss. Gladly he went with her,
    tenderly this expert in Kentucky racers, the finest horses in
    the world, examined the shaggy little pony's hoof. He told
    Madge what to do for him and promised to send up a lotion with
    which to bathe the injured foot, although he gently warned her
    that she must not hope that Little Hawss would ever do much
    racing up and down the mountain trails again. She choked, when
    he said this, and the horseman's heart went out to her.</p>

    <p>"Little one," said the Colonel, as the party was preparing
    to go down the mountain, "you're a thoroughbred, and Colonel
    Sandusky Doolittle is your friend from the word 'go.'" He took
    her hand in his and smiled down into her eyes.</p>

    <p>Then, turning to Miss 'Lethe: "Do you know, Miss 'Lethe,
    there's something about this little girl that puts me in mind
    of you, when I first met you? You remember?"</p>

    <p>"Ah, Colonel, that was twenty years ago&mdash;the day I was
    eighteen."</p>

    <p>"And I was twenty-five. Now I'm forty-five and
    you&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Colonel!"</p>

    <p>"Are still eighteen.' He bowed, impressively, with that
    charming, gallant smile which was peculiar to him.</p>

    <p>"Aren't you going down with us, Frank?" asked Barbara,
    looking at the youth with plain surprise when she noted that he
    lingered when she and her father were ready for the start.</p>

    <p>"I wish to speak to Madge, a moment. I'll overtake you."</p>

    <p>The bluegrass beauty looked at him, wrath blazing in her
    eyes, then turned away with tossing head.</p>

    <p>"Good-bye," said Madge, and held her hand out to her.</p>

    <p>Barbara paid no attention to the small, brown hand, but,
    instead, opened her parasol almost in the face of the
    astonished mountain-girl, who jumped back, startled. "Oh, very
    well," said Barbara to Frank.</p>

    <p>Madge turned to him, the softness of the mood engendered by
    her talk with the Colonel and Miss 'Lethe all gone, now. Her
    face was flushed with anger. "Dellaw!" said she. "Thought she
    was goin' to shoot!"</p>

    <p>Now Barbara spoke haughtily. "Good afternoon, Miss Madge.
    You have entertained us wonderfully, wonderfully."</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER X</h2><br>


    <p>It was late on an afternoon several days after the party
    from the bluegrass had gone down from the mountains when
    Layson, with a letter of great import in his pocket sought
    Madge Brierly.</p>

    <p>He was very happy, as, a short time before he reached her
    isolated cabin, he stepped out to the edge of that same ledge
    where Horace Holton had found the view too full of memories for
    comfort, to look off across the lovely valley spread before,
    below him. There were no memories of struggle and bloodshed to
    arise between him and that view and for a time he gloried in it
    with that bounding, pulsating appreciation which can come to us
    in youth alone, as his eyes swept the fair prospect of wooded
    slope and rugged headland, stream-ribbon, mountain-meadow,
    billowy forest. Then, with a deep breath of the wondrous air of
    the old Cumberlands, which added a physical exhileration almost
    intoxicating to the pleasure of the thoughts which filled his
    mind, he went slowly up the rugged twisting path to Madge's
    cabin. There, standing by the bridge he called, and, presently,
    the girl appeared.</p>

    <p>He smiled at her. He did not wish to tell her, too quickly,
    of the news the letter held.</p>

    <p>The girl was still full of the visit and the visitors. They
    had seemed to her, reared as she had been in the rough
    seclusion of the mountains, like denizens of another,
    wondrously fine world, come to glimpse her in her crude one,
    for a few hours, and then gone back to their own glorious
    abiding place.</p>

    <p>She did not admit it to herself, but they had left behind
    them discontent with the life she knew, her lack of education,
    almost everything with which, in days gone by, she had been so
    satisfied.</p>

    <p>Layson, watching her as she approached, was tempted to enjoy
    her as she was, for a few minutes, before telling her the news
    which, young and inexperienced as he was, he yet knew,
    instinctively, would change her for all time.</p>

    <p>"Well," he said, "how did you like them, Madge?"</p>

    <p>The girl sat upon a stump and looked off across the valley.
    Her hands were clasped upon one knee, as she reflected, the
    fading sunlight touched her hair with sheening brilliance, her
    eyes, at first, were dreamy, happy.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I loved your aunt!" said she. "She made me think of my
    own mammy.... She made me think of my own mammy."</p>

    <p>"And she was quite as much in love with you."</p>

    <p>"Was she?... And Cunnel Doolittle! Ain't he <i>splendid</i>?
    And how he do know hosses! Wouldn't I <i>love</i> to see some
    of them races that he told about? Wouldn't I love to have a
    chance to learn how to become a lady like your aunt? She's just
    the sweetest thing that ever lived."</p>

    <p>"And ... and ... Miss Barbara?" said Layson, with a little
    mischief in his wrinkling eyelids.</p>

    <p>The girl shrugged herself together haughtily upon her stump.
    He had seen lowlands girls use almost the same gesture when, in
    drawing-rooms, some topic had come up which they did not wish
    to talk about.</p>

    <p>"Huh! Her!" said Madge and would have changed the subject
    had he let her.</p>

    <p>"Really?" he asked, wickedly. "Didn't you like her?"</p>

    <p>"I ain't sayin' much," said Madge, "because she's different
    from me, has had more chance, is better dressed, knows more
    from books an' so on, an' it might seem like I was plumb
    jealous of her. Maybe I am, too. But, dellaw! Her with her
    pollysol! When she opened it that way at me I thought it war a
    gun an' she war goin' to fire! Maybe I ain't had no learnin' in
    politeness, but it seems to me I would a been a little more so,
    just the same, if I'd been in her place. She don't like me, she
    don't, an' I&mdash;why, I just <i>hates</i> her! Her with her
    ombril up, an' not a cloud in sight!"</p>

    <p>Layson looked at her and laughed. The letter in his pocket
    made it seem probable that she would not need, in future, to
    submit to such humiliations as the bluegrass girl had put upon
    her, so his merriment could not be counted cruel.</p>

    <p>"Jealous of her?" he inquired, quizzically.</p>

    <p>She sat in deep thought for a moment and then frankly said:
    "I reckon so; a leetle, teeny mite. Maybe it has made me mean
    in thinkin' of her, ever since."</p>

    <p>"You're honest, anyway," said he, "and I shall tell you
    something that will comfort you. She was as jealous of you as
    you were of her."</p>

    <p>"<i>She</i> was!" the girl exclaimed, incredulous,
    surprised. "Of <i>me</i>?" You're crazy, ain't you?"</p>

    <p>"Not a bit."</p>

    <p>"What have <i>I</i> got to make <i>her</i> jealous?"</p>

    <p>"A lot of things. You've beauty such as hers will never
    be&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Dellaw!" said Madge, incredulously. She had no knowledge of
    her own attractiveness. "Don't you start in makin' fun o'
    me."</p>

    <p>"I'm not making fun of you. You're very beautiful&mdash;my
    aunt said so, the Colonel said so, and <i>I've</i> known it,
    all along."</p>

    <p>No one had ever said a thing like this to her, before. She
    looked keenly at him, weighing his sincerity. When she finally
    decided that he really meant what he had said, she breathed a
    long sigh of delight.</p>

    <p>"They said that I&mdash;was <i>beautiful</i>!"</p>

    <p>"They did, and, little girl, you are; and you have more than
    beauty. You have health and strength such as a bluegrass girl
    has never had in all the history of women."</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes," said she, "I'm strong an'
    well&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"But what?"</p>

    <p>"But what?" she quoted bitterly. "But I ain't got no
    eddication. What does strength and what does what you tell me
    is my beauty count, when I ain't got no eddication?
    Why&mdash;why&mdash;I looked plumb <i>foolish</i> by the side
    of her! You think I don't know that my talk sounds rough as
    rocks alongside hers, ripplin' from her lips as smooth as
    water? You think I don't know that I looked like a scare-crow
    in all them clo'es I had fixed up so careful, when she come on
    with her gowns made up for her by <i>dressmakers</i>?
    Why&mdash;why&mdash;I never <i>see</i> a dressmaker in all my
    life! I never even see one!"</p>

    <p>"Well," said he, and looked at her with a slow smile, "there
    probably will be no reason why you may not see as many as you
    like, in years to come,"</p>

    <p>She was amazed. "This some sort o' joke?"</p>

    <p>"No, Madge. How would you like to be rich?"</p>

    <p>"Me?... Rich? Oh ... oh, I'd like it. <i>Then</i> I could go
    down in th' bluegrass, study, l'arn, an'&mdash;I could do a
    heap o' good aroun' hyar, too" She sighed. "But thar never was
    nobody rich in these hyar mountings an' I reckon thar never
    will be."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps you may be," said the youth, and there was a
    serious quality in his voice which made her start and then lean
    forward on her stump to gaze at him with searching, eager
    eyes.</p>

    <p>"Your land down in the valley," he went on, "may contain
    coal and iron enough to give you a fortune. Now there are bad
    men in this world, and I want you to promise me to sell it to
    nobody without first coming to me for advice."</p>

    <p>"Promise?" said the girl, the wonder all ashine in her big
    eyes. "In course I'll promise that. But is there r'ally a
    chance of it?"</p>

    <p>"There really is."</p>

    <p>"Oh, if I only knowed, for shore! Seems like I couldn't
    wait!"</p>

    <p>"You shall know, to-night, or, maybe, sooner. I have the
    engineers report, but I must study it out carefully and make
    sure what boundaries he means. I'm almost certain they include
    your land. As soon as I find out I'll come back here and call
    to you and let you know."</p>

    <p>"I reckon you won't have to call! I'll be watchin' for you
    every minute."</p>

    <p>"Well, I'm off. But remember what I said about letting
    anyone buy any of your land from you. Don't sell an inch, don't
    give an option at whatever price, to anyone without consulting
    me."</p>

    <p>When he had left, the girl still sat there, dreaming on her
    stump after she had watched him out of sight.</p>

    <p>The news that she might become rich had stirred her deeply
    for a moment, but, soon she wondered if riches, really, would
    mean everything, and decided that they would not.</p>

    <p>"Somehow," she mused, "somehow I don't care much about it,
    not unless&mdash;unless&mdash;oh, I can't think of nothin' in
    th' world but him! An' he says he's goin' to go away, never to
    return no more!... Other folks has gone away, afore, but it
    didn't seem to hurt my heart like this. I wonder what is ailin'
    me."</p>

    <p>Her thought turned back to that half-bitter, half-delightful
    moment when he had tried to kiss her at the bridge. "Why, even
    then," she mused, "thar were somethin' seemed to draw me to him
    in spite o' myself. Never felt anythin' like it afore. It
    war&mdash;just as if I war asleep, all over, an' never wanted
    to wake up! I wonder if I wish he warn't comin' back,
    to-night&mdash;not half so much, I reckon, as I wish he warn't
    never goin' away!"</p>

    <p>She left her resting place upon the stump, and, torn by
    varying emotions, found a place upon the trail where she could
    look off to his camp. She was standing there, leaning
    listlessly against a tree, when the sound of someone coming
    made her turn her head. She saw Joe Lorey.</p>

    <p>"Madge," said he, approaching, "I wants a word with
    you,"</p>

    <p>She did not wish to talk with him. Her mind was far too busy
    with its thoughts of Layson, its dismay at the prospect of his
    departure. "No time, Joe; it's too late," said she. She started
    to go by him toward her little bridge.</p>

    <p>But he was not inclined to be put off. The mountaineer's
    slow mind had been at work with his great problem and he had
    quite determined that he would take some action, definite and
    unmistakable, without delay. He had leaned his ever-present
    rifle up against a stump, had laid the old game-sack, still
    burdened with the stolen dynamite, upon the ground, close to
    it, and was prepared to talk the matter out, to one end or the
    other. He loved her with the fierce love of the primitive man;
    his rising wrath against the circumstances amidst which he
    seemed to be so powerless had made him sullen and suspicious;
    mountain life, continual defiance of the law, unceasing
    watchfulness for "revenuers," does not teach a man to be
    smooth-mannered, half-way in his methods. He made a move as if
    to catch her arm; she darted by him, running straight toward
    the old game-sack.</p>

    <p>That burden in the game-sack had been a constant horror to
    him ever since he had first stolen it down at the railroad
    workings. The mighty evidence of the power of the explosive
    which had been shown to him when it had torn and mangled its
    poor victim there, had filled him with a terror of it, although
    it had also filled him with determination to make use of that
    great power if necessary. But now, as he saw her running,
    light-footed, lovely, toward the bag which held it, running in
    exactly the right way to stumble on it if a mis-step chanced,
    his heart sprang to his throat. What if the dire explosive he
    had planned to use upon his enemies should prove to be the
    death of the one being whom he loved? He sprang toward her with
    the mighty impulse of desperate muscles spurred by a
    panic-stricken mind and caught her, roughly, just before her
    foot would have touched and spurned the game-sack.</p>

    <p>"Stop!" he cried, in desperation.</p>

    <p>She was amazed that he should take so great a liberty. She
    stopped, perforce, but, after she had stopped, she stood there
    trembling with hot anger. "Joe Lorey," she exclaimed, "you
    dare!"</p>

    <p>Now he was all humility as he let his hand fall from her
    arm. "It was for your sake, Madge," said he. "A stumble on that
    sack&mdash;it mout have sent us both to Kingdom Come!"</p>

    <p>She looked at him incredulously, then down at the sack.
    "That old game-sack? Why, Joe, you're plumb distracted!"</p>

    <p>"I'm in my senses, yet, I tell you," he persisted. "T'other
    day I went down where they're blastin' for th' railroad. I see
    'em usin' dynamighty, down thar, an' I watched my chance an',
    when it come, I slipped one o' th' bombs into that game-sack.
    Ef you'd chanced to kick it&mdash;"</p>

    <p>She was impressed. "Dynamighty bombs? Dellaw! What's
    dynamighty bombs?"</p>

    <p>"It's a giant powder, a million times stronger nor mine." He
    reached into the sack and, with cautious fingers, took out the
    cartridge and the fuse, exhibiting them to her. "See here. I
    seed 'em take a bomb no bigger nor this one, an' light a fuse
    like this, an' when it caught it ennymost shook down a
    mounting! I seed a poor chap what war careless with one, an'
    when they picked him up, why&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Don't, Joe!" said the girl, looking at the cartridge with
    the light of horror shining in her eyes. "What you doin' with
    such devil's stuff?"</p>

    <p>"I got it for th' revenuers," he said frankly. The
    mountaineers of the old Cumberland, to this day, make no secret
    of their deadly hatred for the agents of the government excise.
    "They're snoopin' 'round th' mountings, an' if they find my
    still I plan to blow it into nothin', an' them with it."</p>

    <p>She recoiled from him. "No, no, Joe; you'd better gin th'
    still up, nor do such work as that!"</p>

    <p>"I'll never gin it up!" said he, with a set face. "It's
    mine; it war my father's long before me. There's only one thing
    could ever make me gin it up."</p>

    <p>"What's that?" The girl was still spellbound by the
    fascination of the dynamite which she had come so near to
    treading on. Her eyes were fixed upon the cartridge in his hand
    with horror, wonder.</p>

    <p>He stepped closer to her. "I mout gin it up for you!"</p>

    <p>"For me?"</p>

    <p>"You know I've loved ye sence ye were that high," said he,
    and measured with his hand a very little way up the side of the
    old stump. "Many a time I've listened hyar to your evenin'
    hymn, an' thought I'd rather hear you singin' in my home than
    hear th' angels singin' in th' courts o' Heaven. Say th' word,
    Madge&mdash;say you'll be my little wife!"</p>

    <p>The girl was woe fully affected. Her eyes filled and her
    bosom heaved with feeling. It cut her to the soul to have to
    hurt this playmate of her babyhood, defender of her youth,
    companion of her budding womanhood; their lives had been
    linked, too, by the great tragedy which, years ago, had
    orphaned both of them. But, of late, she had felt sure that she
    could never marry him. She would not admit, even to herself,
    just why this was; but it was so. "No, no, Joe; it can never
    be," she said.</p>

    <p>He knew! "And why?" said he, his face blackening with bitter
    feeling, his brows contracting fiercely. "Because that furriner
    from the blue grass has come atween us!"</p>

    <p>Madge, surprised that he should guess the secret which she
    had scarcely admitted, even to herself, was, for a second,
    frightened by his keenness. Had she shown her feelings with
    such freedom? But she quickly regained self-control and
    answered with a clever counterfeit of lightness. "Him? Oh, sho!
    He'd never think o' me that way!"</p>

    <p>"Mebbe so," said Joe, "but I know you think more o' th'
    books he teaches you from than o' my company. From th' thickets
    borderin' th' clearin' where you've studied, I've watched you
    settin' thar with him, wen I'd give th' world to be thar in his
    place. Why, I'd ennymost gin up my life for one kiss, Madge!"
    He looked at her with pitiful love and longing in his eyes; but
    this soon changed to a sort of mad determination. "I'll have
    it, too!" he cried, advancing toward her.</p>

    <p>She was amazed, not in the least dismayed. Indeed the
    episode took from the moment some of its emotional strain. That
    he should try to do this utterly unwarrantable thing took a
    portion of the weight of guilty feeling from her heart. It had
    been pressing heavily there. "You shan't!" she cried. "Careful,
    Joe Lorey!"</p>

    <p>She eluded him with ease and ran across her little bridge.
    He paused, a second, in astonishment, and, as he paused, she
    grasped the rope and pulled the little draw up after her.</p>

    <p>"Look out, Joe; it air a hundred feet, straight down!" she
    cried, as she saw that the baffled mountaineer was trembling on
    the chasm's edge, as if preparing for a spring. "Good night,
    Joe. Take my advice&mdash;gin up th' still, an' all thought of
    makin' a wife of a girl as ain't willin'."</p>

    <p>Half laughing and half crying she ran up the path which
    wound about among the thickets on the rocky little island where
    her rough cabin stood, secure, secluded.</p>

    <p>The mountaineer stood, baffled, on the brink of the ravine.
    Much loneliness among the mountains, where there was no voice
    but his own to listen to, had given him the habit of talking to
    himself in moments of excitement.</p>

    <p>"Gone! Gone!" he said. "Gone laughin' at me!" He clenched
    his fists. "And it is him as has come atween us!" He turned
    slowly from the place, picked up his rifle, slung the
    game-sack, saggin with the weight of the dynamite, across his
    shoulder by its strap, and started from the place.</p>

    <p>He had gone but a short distance, though, before he stopped,
    considering. Murder was in Joe Lorey's heart.</p>

    <p>"She said he war comin' back," he sullenly reflected. "I'll
    ... lay for him, right hyar."</p>

    <p>He looked cautiously about. His quick ear caught the sound
    of footsteps coming up the trail.</p>

    <p>"Somebody's stirrin', now," he said. "Oh, if it's only
    him!"</p>

    <p>He slipped behind a rock to wait in ambush.</p>

    <p>But it was not his enemy who came, now, along the trail.
    Horace Holton, held to the mountains by his mysterious
    business, had left the others of the party to go home alone, as
    they had come, and returned to the neighborhood which housed
    the girl who owned the land he coveted.</p>

    <p>Joe, suspicious of him, as the mountaineer who makes his
    living as a moonshiner, is, of course, of every stranger who
    appears within his mountains, stepped forward, suddenly, his
    rifle in his hand and ready to be used. He had no idea that the
    man had been a member of the party from the bluegrass.</p>

    <p>"Halt, you!" he cried.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2><br>


    <p>Holton, full of scheming, was returning up the trail after
    having said good-bye to Barbara, Miss Alathea and the Colonel
    at the railway in the valley, climbing steadily and skillfully,
    without much thought of his surroundings. The locality,
    familiar to him years before (although he had at great pains
    indicated to everyone but Barbara that it was wholly strange to
    him) showed but superficial change to his searching,
    reminiscent eyes. His feet had quickly fallen into the almost
    automatic climbing-stride of the born mountaineer, and his
    thoughts had gradually absorbed themselves in memories of the
    past. Joe Lorey's sudden command to halt was somewhat
    startling, therefore, even to his iron nerves. Instinctively
    and instantly he heeded the gruff order.</p>

    <p>Dusk was falling and he could not very clearly see the
    moonshiner, at first, as he stepped from behind the shelter of
    his rock. He moved slowly on, a step or two, hands half raised
    to show that they did not hold weapons, recovering quickly from
    the little shock of the surprise, planning an explanation to
    whatever mountaineer had thought his coming up the trail at
    that hour a suspicious circumstance. That he was one of
    Layson's friends from the low-country would, he thought, be
    proof enough that he was not an enemy of mountain-folk. Layson,
    he knew, was generally regarded with good will by the shy
    dwellers in this wilderness.</p>

    <p>But when he clearly saw Joe Lorey's face a thrill shot
    through him far more lasting than the little tremor born, at
    first, of the command to halt.</p>

    <p>He had not seen the youth before. Joe, half jealous, half
    contemptuous, of Layson's fine friends from the bluegrass, had
    kept out of their sight, although he had watched them furtively
    from covert almost constantly; and, it chanced, had not been so
    much as mentioned by either Frank or Madge while the party from
    the bluegrass lingered at the camp, save when Madge told the
    tragic story of her childhood while Holton stood aloof, for
    reasons of his own, hearing but imperfectly.</p>

    <p>Now the unexpected sight of the young man, for some reasons,
    made the old one gasp in horror. There was that about the face,
    the attitude, the very way the lithe moonshiner held his gun,
    which made him seem, to the astonished man whom he had halted,
    like a grim vision from the past. "My God!" he thought. "Can
    the dead have come to life?"</p>

    <p>For an instant he went weak. His blood chilled and the quick
    beating of his heart changed the deep breathing of his recent
    swinging stride into short, sharp gasps.</p>

    <p>It was only for an instant, though. His life had not been
    one to teach him to falter long in the face of an emergency.
    Quickly he regained poise and reasoned calmly.</p>

    <p>"No," he thought, "it's Joe, Ben Lorey's son. Th' father's
    layin' where he has been, all these years. I'm skeery as a
    girl."</p>

    <p>Joe advanced upon him truculently. "Say," he demanded,
    "what's yer name an' what ye want here?" His ever ready rifle
    nested in the crook of his left arm, his brow was threatening,
    his mouth was firmly set an instant after he had spoken.</p>

    <p>Holton, recovering himself quickly, spoke calmly,
    propitiatingly. "My name's Holton. I want to see th' gal as
    lives up yander. Want to buy her land of her."</p>

    <p>Lorey, satisfied by this explanation that the stranger was
    not a government agent, as he had, at first suspected, relaxed
    his tense rigidity of muscles. From fear of revenuers his
    disturbed mind returned quickly to the bitterness of his
    resentment of what he thought Madge Brierly's infatuation for
    the young lowlander.</p>

    <p>"It's too late," he said. "Thar's only one man as she'd let
    down that bridge for, now&mdash;th' man I thought ye might
    be&mdash;Frank Layson."</p>

    <p>Holton, quick to see the possibility of gaining an
    advantage, realizing from the young man's tone that he was
    certainly no friend of Layson's, guessing, with quick cunning,
    at what the situation was, decided that the thing for him to do
    was to reveal the fact that, in his heart, he, also, hated
    Layson.</p>

    <p>"So ye took me for a revenuer or Frank Layson, eh?" said he.
    "I know what th' mountings think o' revenuers, an' I reckon,
    from yer handlin' o' that rifle, that you're no friend o'
    Layson's."</p>

    <p>Joe, full of the fierce bitterness of his resentment, was
    ready to confide in anyone his hatred of the "furriner" who had
    come up and won the girl he loved. He let the barrel of his
    rifle slip between his fingers till its stock was resting on
    the ground.</p>

    <p>"I hates him as I hates but one man in th' world!" he said,
    with bitter emphasis.</p>

    <p>"Who's that?" said Holton, thoughtlessly, although, an
    instant afterward, he was sorry that he had pursued the
    subject.</p>

    <p>"Lem Lindsay," Lorey answered; "him as killed my father.
    Frank Layson's come between me an' Madge Brierly, an' he's got
    to cl'ar my tracks!" His voice thrilled with the intensity of
    his emotion, and, suddenly, he caught his rifle up, again, into
    his crooked elbow, where it rested ready for quick usage. "If
    you plans to warn him&mdash;" he began.</p>

    <p>"Warn him!" said the older man, with a bitterness, real or
    counterfeited, whichever it might be, as fierce as that which
    rang in the young moonshiner's own voice, "I hate him as much
    as you. I'd rather warn you."</p>

    <p>"Warn me o' what?" Lorey had begun to lose suspicion of the
    stranger. If, really, he hated Layson, he might make of him a
    useful ally.</p>

    <p>"Your name's Lorey," Holton answered, with his keen eyes
    fixed intently on those of the man who stood there, tensely
    listening to him, "an' yo' keep a still."</p>

    <p>Now Lorey again caught his rifle quickly in both hands; his
    face showed new apprehension, and a terrible determination,
    desperate and dreadful. If this stranger knew about the still,
    was it not certain that he was a government spy and therefore
    worthy of quick death?</p>

    <p>"Keerful!" he said menacingly. "Hyar in th' mountings that
    word's worth your life!" The youth, with frowning brow and
    glittering, wolfish eyes, stood facing Holton like an animal at
    bay, with what amounted to a threat of murder on his lips.</p>

    <p>"I'm speakin' it for your own good," the old man answered,
    throwing into his voice as much of frankness as he could
    command. "I tell you that th' revemooers have got word about
    your still."</p>

    <p>"Then somebody's spied an' told 'em."</p>

    <p>Here was Holton's chance. The vicious scheme came to him in
    a flash. Layson he hated fiercely; this youth he hated
    fiercely. What plan could be better than to set the one to hunt
    the other? If Lorey should kill Layson it would remove Layson
    from his path and make his way clear to the purchase of Madge
    Brierly's coal-lands at a small fraction of their value. And,
    having killed him, Lorey would, of course, be forced to flee
    the country, for the hue and cry would be far-reaching. Such a
    killing never would be passed over as an ordinary mountain
    murder generally is by the authorities. Thus, at once, he might
    be rid of the young bluegrass gentleman he hated and the young
    mountaineer he feared.</p>

    <p>"You're right," said he. "Somebody's spied an' told 'em.
    Somebody as stumbled on yore still while he was huntin'."</p>

    <p>Lorey looked at him, wide-eyed, infuriated. Instantly he
    quite believed what Holton said. It dove-tailed with his own
    grim hate of Layson that Layson should hate him and try to work
    his ruin by giving information to the revenuers. "Somebody
    huntin'!" he exclaimed. "Frank Layson! Say it, say it!"</p>

    <p>"Promise you'll never speak my name?" said Holton. He had no
    wish to be mixed up in the tragic matter, and he knew,
    instinctively, that if Joe Lorey gave his word, moonshiner and
    lawbreaker as he was, it would be kept to the grim end.</p>

    <p>"I promise it, if it air th' truth you're tellin' me," said
    Lorey.</p>

    <p>"It's true, then," Holton answered. "You can see for your
    own self that I'm a stranger hyar. I couldn't a' knowed o' th'
    still exceptin' through Frank Layson."</p>

    <p>The simple, specious argument to Lorey was convincing. "It
    air true," he admitted slowly. "Nobody else would a' gin ye th'
    word." The angry youth paused in black, murderous thought. "He
    air a-comin' hyar, to-night," he went on presently. "I heered
    him tell Madge Brierly that he war comin' back, this evenin'.
    You better&mdash;maybe you had better git along." He had no
    wish for witnesses to what he planned, now, to accomplish, when
    Layson should come back to Madge, as he had promised, with the
    engineer's report upon her coal lands.</p>

    <p>Holton nodded, grimly satisfied that he had planted a
    suspicion which might flower into his own revenge. That blow
    which Layson had delivered on his face, in the old days, had
    left a scar upon his soul, and now that the young man seemed
    likely to add to this unforgotten injury the new one of
    retiring from the field as suitor for his daughter, and,
    further, interfering with his plans to rob Madge Brierly of her
    coal lands, his hatred of him had become intense, insatiable.
    What better fortune could he wish than to pit this mountain
    youth, whom, also, for a reason carried over from dark days in
    his past life, he hated, against the young man from the
    bluegrass whom he hated no less bitterly?</p>

    <p>"Go by <i>that</i> path, thar," said Lorey, suddenly, and
    pointing, as Holton started to return by the direct route he
    had followed as he came. "It air round-about, but it'll lead
    you to th' valley. I'll run no risk o' your warnin' him."</p>

    <p>"Don't you be skeered," said Holton. "I'll keep mum, no
    matter what happens."</p>

    <p>With a grim smile he started down the path which the
    mountaineer had pointed out.</p>

    <p>"Laid his whip acrost my face!" he muttered as he went.
    "Trifled with my gal! Him an' Ben Lorey's son&mdash;let 'em
    fight it out! I'm so much th' better off."</p>

    <p>And Lorey, slipping back into the shadow of a rock, after he
    had made quite certain that the stranger was following his
    directions, was reflecting, bitterly: "He's come atween me an'
    th' gal I love! He's put th' revenoo hounds upon my track! Oh,
    if he had a dozen lives, I'd have 'em all!"</p>

    <p>For ten alert and watchful minutes, which seemed to stretch
    to hours, he crouched there, waiting, waiting, waiting, for the
    coming of the man he hated. During five of these he listened to
    the sounds of Holton's downward progress, brought to his keen
    ear on the soft breezes of the young night. There came the
    crackling of a twig, the thud, thud, thud of a dislodged stone
    bounding down the slope, the rustle of leaves as the old man
    shuffled through a pocket of them gathered in the lea of some
    protruding rock by vagrant winds. Then all was still. He did
    not guess that Holton had been anxious that these sounds should
    reach him; that he had stumbled down the trail with awkward
    feet with no thought in his mind but to be certain that the
    sounds should reach him. Such was the case, however, and, after
    he felt sure that the crouching mountaineer above must be
    convinced that he had gone on to the valley, the old man
    turned, catlike, re-ascended with a skill as great as Lorey's
    own, and, with not a sound to warn the mountaineer that he had
    retraced any of his steps, took cautious place behind a rock
    upon the very edge of the open space where, when Layson came,
    he felt quite sure a tragedy would be enacted.</p>

    <p>Then Layson came blithely up the trail. He had gone through
    the engineer's report with care. The coal prospects included
    the girl's land. He was full of rare elation at thought of the
    good luck which had descended on the little mountain-maid, full
    of pleasant plans for a bright future from none of which she
    was omitted.</p>

    <p>His dreams were rudely interrupted as Joe Lorey stepped
    ominously from behind the rock where he had waited for him.</p>

    <p>"Hold up your hands!" the mountaineer commanded, with his
    rifle levelled at the advancing youth.</p>

    <p>"Joe Lorey!" exclaimed Layson.</p>

    <p>"You know what air between us. Your time air come. If you
    want to pray, do it quick, for my finger air itchin' to pull
    th' trigger."</p>

    <p>Layson's blood and breeding told, in this emergency. He did
    not flinch a whit. "I'm ready," he said calmly. "I'm not afraid
    to die, though it's hard to meet death at the hands of a
    coward."</p>

    <p>"Coward!" said the mountaineer, amazed. "You call me
    that?"</p>

    <p>"The man who shoots another in cold blood, giving him no
    chance for his life, deserves no better name."</p>

    <p>This appealed to Lorey. So had his father died&mdash;at the
    hands of one who killed him in cold blood, giving him no chance
    for his life. "You shan't die callin' me that!" he cried. He
    leaned his rifle against a nearby rock, threw his knife upon
    the ground beside it, pulled off his coat, and thus, unarmed,
    advanced upon his enemy. "We're ekal now," he said with grim
    intensity, and pointed to the chasm through which ran the
    stream which made Madge Brierly's refuge an island. "That gully
    air a hundred feet straight down," he said, "an' its bottom air
    kivered with rocks. When we're through, your body or mine'll
    lay there. Air you ready?"</p>

    <p>Holton, tense with excitement, was watching every move of
    the two men from his hidden vantage point. Upon his face was
    the expression of an animal of prey.</p>

    <p>"Ready!" said Frank, quietly.</p>

    <p>It was a terrific struggle which ensued. The trained muscles
    of the lowland athlete were matched against the lithe thews of
    the mountaineer so evenly that, for a time, there was doubt of
    what the outcome might be. Holton, watching, watching, thrilled
    with every second of it. Little he cared which man won; the
    best thing which possibly could happen, for his own good, he
    reflected, would be that both should crash down to the bottom
    of the gully locked in one of their bear-hugs, to fall together
    on the jagged rocks below. The fierce breathing of the
    contestants, the shuffle of their struggling feet upon the
    ground, the occasional involuntary groan from one man or the
    other as his adversary crushed him in embrace so painful that
    an exclamation could not be suppressed, were all music to the
    ears of the old man behind the rock. Both youths were perils to
    him. Let them kill each other. He would be the gainer, whatever
    the outcome of the battle.</p>

    <p>Suddenly Frank's foot slipped on a rolling pebble. Instantly
    Lorey had taken advantage of the mishap, and, with a quick
    wrench, thrown him crashing to the earth. He lay there,
    scarcely breathing, utterly unconscious.</p>

    <p>The mountaineer bent over him, ready to meet the first sign
    of revival with renewed attack, his bloodshot eyes strained on
    the face of the young man upon the ground. Then, anxious to be
    satisfied that his prostrate enemy was not feigning, he knelt
    by him and peered into his face, placed his hand upon his chest
    above his heart, felt his pulse with awkward fingers. He
    wondered, now, if he had not killed him, outright, for Frank's
    head had struck the ground with a terrific impact. But Layson's
    nostrils soon began to dilate and contract with a spasmodic
    breathing. He still lived.</p>

    <p>Rendered careless by the excitement of the moment, Joe again
    yielded to the habit engendered by much solitude and spoke his
    thoughts aloud.</p>

    <p>"It'll be long afore he'll stir," he muttered. "I'll throw
    him down into th' gully."</p>

    <p>He rose, and, going to the side of the ravine, peered over
    with a fearful curiosity at the brawling torrent, cut into
    foam-ribbons by a horde of knife-edged rocks. Then he went to
    Layson and stretched out his hand to grasp his shoulder.</p>

    <p>Occurred a psychological phenomenon. He found his courage
    fail at thought of laying hands upon the man as he was
    stretched there helpless.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I can't touch him!" he exclaimed. "It'd
    be&mdash;why, it'd be like handlin' th' dead!"</p>

    <p>He drew back, nonplussed, ashamed of his own timidity, yet
    unable to overcome it. He had felled the man and meant to kill
    him, yet, now, he could not bring himself to lay a hand upon
    him.</p>

    <p>The thought then flashed into his mind of the dreadful
    contents of his old game-sack.</p>

    <p>"Th' bomb," he said. "Th' dynamighty bomb that I was savin'
    for th' revenuers! Let that finish out th' man as set 'em onto
    me!"</p>

    <p>He took the bomb from the old sack with trembling fingers,
    laid it by Frank's side and, with a match which flickered
    because the hands which held it were unsteady as a palsied
    man's, set fire to the fuse. Then he drew off to one side.</p>

    <p>"Now, burn!" he said, with set teeth and lowering brow.
    "Burn! Burn!"</p>

    <p>For a second he stood there, watching the sparking sputter
    of the powder as it slowly ate its way along the little paper
    tube. Then, suddenly, a dreadful thought occurred to him. The
    girl! What if Madge Brierly should come to meet the lowlander
    before the bomb exploded, should see him lying there, should
    hurry to him, frightened, and get there just in time
    to&mdash;</p>

    <p>He shuddered. He must protect the girl he loved! She could
    reach the side of the endangered man only by means of the small
    bridge. But one rope held it in position above the deep,
    precipitous-sided gully.</p>

    <p>He raised his rifle to his shoulder. It was a hard shot, one
    which most men would have deemed impossible, but there was a
    star in line. He fired. The bridge crashed down, a ruin, the
    severed rope now dangling limply, freed of the burden it had
    held for many years.</p>

    <p>"She's safe!" said he.</p>

    <p>For another instant he stood studying the spluttering fuse.
    From what he had seen at the railroad workings he knew it was
    destined to burn long enough so that many workmen could get out
    of danger before the spark reached the strong explosive in the
    cartridge. He need not hurry.</p>

    <p>"In three minutes it'll all be ended," he reflected. "He's
    as helpless as a baby; he can't strike back, now; it's no more
    nor he deserves. I'm goin'."</p>

    <p>He straightened up and would have hurried off, had not, at
    just that moment, the sweet voice of the girl he loved rung
    through the brooding, fragrant evening air, in song.</p>

    <p>It brought him to himself, it filled him with a horrified
    realization of the foulness of the deed which he was
    contemplating.</p>

    <p>"No&mdash;no!" said he. "Why, I'd be the coward that he
    called me!"</p>

    <p>He hurried to the fuse and, with trembling eagerness,
    stamped out the spark which, now, was creeping close indeed to
    that point where it would have blossomed into the terrifying
    flower of death.</p>

    <p>"I'll fight him ag'in," he said; and then, addressing the
    now extinguished fuse, the harmless cartridge of explosive:
    "You lie thar and prove ter him I ain't no coward!"</p>

    <p>He hurried down the trail.</p>

    <p>Holton, vastly disappointed, crept out from his hiding
    place. "The fool!" he muttered. "Oh, the fool! That thar little
    spark would a' put me even an' made me safe fer life! An' it
    war lighted&mdash;it war lighted!"</p>

    <p>His regret was keen. He raged there like a madman robbed of
    his intended prey. Then, suddenly:</p>

    <p>"But&mdash;who'll believe him when he says he put it out?
    I'll&mdash;do it!"</p>

    <p>He hastily took out a match, struck it, relighted the dead
    fuse.</p>

    <p>"It'll be his work, not mine!" he thought, exultantly, as he
    paused to see that the fuse would surely burn.</p>

    <p>As he turned to hasten from the spot he caught a glimpse of
    something white across the gully at the thresh-hold of the
    girl's cabin. For a second this was terrifying, but he quickly
    regained poise. The bridge was gone. She could not reach the
    side of the endangered man to save him, she could not reach the
    mainland to pursue him and discover his identity. He fled.</p>

    <p>The girl was worried by the long delay in Layson's coming.
    For fully half an hour she had been listening for his cheery
    hail&mdash;that hail which had, of late, come to mean so much
    to her&mdash;as she worked about her household tasks. The last
    words he had said to her had hinted at such unimagined
    possibilities of riches, of education, of delirious delights to
    come, that her impatience was but natural; and, besides this,
    Joe's words had worried her. She did not think the mountaineer
    would ever really let his jealousy lead him to a foul attack
    upon his rival, but his words had worried her. She stood upon
    her doorstep, hand above her eyes, and peered across the gorge
    toward where the trail debouched into the little clearing.</p>

    <p>Nothing was in sight there, and her gaze wandered along the
    little rocky field, in aimless scrutiny. Finally it chanced
    upon the prostrate form of the young man.</p>

    <p>"What's that lyin' thar?" she thought, intensely startled.
    And then, after another moment's peering: "Why, it's Mr.
    Frank!"</p>

    <p>She was amazed and frightened. Then her eye caught the
    little sputtering of sparks along the fuse. It further startled
    her.</p>

    <p>"It's Mr. Frank and somethin's burnin' close beside
    him!"</p>

    <p>Suspicion flashed into her mind like lightning, followed,
    almost instantly, by firm conviction.</p>

    <p>"It's a fuse," she cried, "an' thar by him is th' bomb! It's
    Joe Lorey's work! Oh, oh&mdash;"</p>

    <p>She sprang down the rough path toward the place where, ever
    since she could remember, the little bridge had swung. Now,
    though, it was gone.</p>

    <p>"The bridge!" she cried. "The bridge! It's gone! I can't
    cross! I've got to see him die!"</p>

    <p>Her frantic eyes caught sight of the frayed rope, dangling
    from the firm supports which had so long held up the bridge by
    means of it. Instantly her quick mind saw the only chance there
    was to save the man whom, now, she knew she loved. She sprang
    for the rope and caught it, gave herself a mighty push with
    both her agile feet, and, hanging above certain death if hold
    should fail or rope break, swung across the chasm and found
    foothold on the mainland.</p>

    <p>In another second she was at the side of the unconscious
    man. Another and she had the cartridge, sputtering fuse and
    all, in her right hand, another and the deadly thing was
    hurtling to the bottom of the deep ravine, whence an almost
    immediately ensuing crashing boom told her that she had not
    arrived a moment sooner than had been essential to the
    salvation of the man she loved.</p>

    <p>She knelt by Frank, pulled his head up to her knee, chafed
    at his insensate hands, and called to him wildly, fearing that
    he was dead.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2><br>


    <p>Joe Lorey was unhappy in his mountains. After the visiting
    party had gone down from Layson's camp, and, in course of time,
    Layson himself had followed them because of the approach of the
    great race which was to make or mar his fortunes, the man
    breathed easier, although their coming and the subsequent
    events had made, he knew, impressions on his life which never
    could be wiped away. He hated Layson none the less because he
    had departed. He argued that he had not gone until he viciously
    had stolen that thing which he, Lorey, valued most: the love of
    beautiful Madge Brierly. He brooded constantly upon this,
    neglecting his small mountain farm, spending almost all his
    time at his illegal trade of brewing untaxed whisky in his
    hidden still, despite the girl's continual urgings to give up
    the perilous occupation before it was too late. He had told her
    that he would, if she would marry him; now that she would not,
    he told her surlily that he would continue to defy the law even
    if he knew that every "revenuer" in the state was on his trail.
    He was conscious that there was real danger; he believed that
    Layson knew about the still and that the bitter enmity
    resulting from the fight which had so nearly proved his death
    might prompt him to betrayal of the secret; but with the
    stubbornness of the mountaineer he clung doggedly to his
    illegal apparatus in the mountain-cave, kept doggedly at the
    illegal work he did with it. It was characteristic of the man,
    his forbears and his breed in general, that, now, when he knew
    that deadly danger well might threaten, he sent more moonshine
    whisky from the still than ever had gone from it in like length
    of time, either in his father's day or his.</p>

    <p>That his actual and only dangerous enemy was Holton, he did
    not, for an instant, guess. He knew of not the slightest reason
    why this stranger should include him in the hatred he had sworn
    he felt for Layson&mdash;that hatred which, he had assured him,
    was as bitter as his own. He would have been as much astonished
    as dismayed had he known that Holton's almost instant action,
    upon arriving at the county-seat, had been to make a visit to
    the local chief of the Revenue-Service&mdash;cautiously, at
    night, for to be known as an informer might have cost his life
    at other hands than Lorey's, would have made the mountain for
    far miles blaze vividly with wrath against him.</p>

    <p>So, defiant of the man he thought to be his foe, unconscious
    of the hatred of the man who really was, Lorey was working in
    his still when a small boy, sent up from a cabin far below,
    dashed, breathless, to him with the news that revenue-men were
    actually upon their way in his direction. He had scarcely time
    to put his fire out, hide the lighter portions of his apparatus
    and flee to a safe hiding-place, nearby, before, clambering
    with lithe skill and caution almost equal to his own along the
    rocky pathways of the mountain-side, armed like soldiers
    scouting in a hostile country, cool-eyed as Indians, hard-faced
    as executioners, they actually appeared.</p>

    <p>For a time, as Lorey watched their progress from his covert,
    he held his rifle levelled, held his finger on its trigger,
    determined to kill them in their tracks; and it was no thrill
    of mercy for the men or fear of consequences to himself which
    saved their lives. It was rather that he did not wish further
    to risk his liberty until he had had opportunity to glance
    along the gleaming barrel of his rifle as it was pointed at
    Frank Layson's heart.</p>

    <p>After the men had gone he went back to his still to view the
    ruins they had left behind them. His wrath was terrible. Madge,
    who had, of course, learned what had happened almost instantly,
    for the still was scarcely out of hearing of her cabin, tried
    vainly to console, to calm him. He turned on her with a rage of
    which, in all her life among hot-tempered mountaineers, she had
    never seen the equal, and chokingly swore vengeance on the man
    who had given the information which had resulted in the
    raid.</p>

    <p>"They come straight to th' still," he told her, "never
    falterin', never wonderin' if, maybe, they was on th' right
    path. Ev'ry inch o' th' hull way had been mapped out for 'em,
    an' they didn't make a mis-step from th' valley to th' very
    entrance o' th' cave. I'll git th' chap that planned their
    course out for 'em thataway! I'll git 'im, Madge! I'll git 'im,
    sure!"</p>

    <p>Her heart sank in her breast like lead. She knew perfectly
    whom Lorey meant. She knew as perfectly that Layson never had
    informed upon the moonshiner, but she also knew that Heaven
    itself could not, then, convince the man of that.</p>

    <p>"Who do you mean you'll git, Joe?" she faltered, hoping
    against hope that she was wrong in her suspicions.</p>

    <p>"You know well enough," he answered. "Who would I mean but
    that damn' furriner, Frank Layson? He warn't satisfied with
    comin' here an' stealin' you away from me! He had to put th'
    revenuers on th' track o' th' old still that was my dad's afore
    me, an' has been th' one thing, siden you, I've ever keered fer
    in my life."</p>

    <p>"You're wrong, Joe," she insisted. "You're shore wrong.
    Frank Layson'd never do a coward's trick like that!"</p>

    <p>"He done it!" Lorey answered doggedly. "He done it, an' as
    there is a God in Heaven he air goin' to pay th' price fer
    doin' it!"</p>

    <p>With that he stalked off down the trail, his rifle held as
    ever in the crook of his elbow, his brows as black as human
    brows could be.</p>

    <p>For a time she sat there on a rock, gazing after him,
    half-stupefied, with eyes wide, terror-stricken. What could a
    mere girl do to avert the dreadful tragedy impending? Tireless
    as he was, she knew that he could keep upon the trail for
    twenty-four hours without a pause, and that such travelling,
    with the lifts which he would get from mountain teamsters,
    would take him to the home of the man whose life he had
    determined to snuff out at any hazard. Beside herself with
    fright for Frank, she sped back to her cabin, took what food
    was ready-cooked and could be bundled up to carry on the
    journey, put on her heaviest shoes and started for the door.
    But, suddenly, the thought flashed through her mind that, even
    as Joe Lorey was bound down the trails to meet his rival, so
    would she be bound down them to meet her own. She could not
    bear the thought of facing Barbara Holton, clad, as she was
    now, in rough, half-shapeless, mountain-homespun. She made
    another bundle, larger than the one which held her food, by
    many times, and, when she finally set off, this bundle held the
    finery which she had so laboriously prepared in the mad hope of
    rivaling the work of the bluegrass belle's accomplished city
    dressmakers.</p>

    <p>Down in the bluegrass home of the ancient Layson family all
    was excitement in anticipation of the race which was to mean so
    much to the fortunes of the young master of the fine old
    mansion which, with pillared porticos and mighty chimneys,
    dominated the whole section. Layson's heart was filled with
    confidence whenever he went to the stables to view the really
    startling beauty of the lovely animal on which his hope was
    pinned; it sunk into despair, when, seated in his study in the
    house, away from her, he counted up the cost of all which he
    would lose if she did not run first in the great race.</p>

    <p>None but the Colonel, Miss Alathea and himself had an idea
    of the real magnitude of the stakes dependant on Queen Bess.
    Upon the glossy shoulders of the lovely mare rested, indeed, a
    great burden of responsibility. If she won she would not only
    secure the large purse for the owner, but be salable for a
    price which would enable him to take advantage, fully, of the
    offer which the syndicate had made to develop his coal lands.
    If she failed&mdash;well, the fortunes of the house of Layson
    would be seriously shattered.</p>

    <p>No wonder, then, that Uncle Neb, in whom his master's
    confidence was absolute, had strict injunctions closely to
    guard the mare. The faithful negro watched her with a vigilance
    which was scarcely less unremitting in the daytime than it was
    at night when he slept upon the very straw which bedded
    her.</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea, intensely prejudiced against horse-racing and
    the gambling which invariably goes with it, by the Colonel's
    wasted life and her own ensuing loneliness, nevertheless prayed
    night and day that Queen Bess would be victorious, for Frank
    had finally refused, point-blank, to let her risk her fortune
    in the scheme for the development of his coal-lands, and so, if
    the mare lost and the eastern firm refused to purchase her at
    the large price which would enable him to join the syndicate,
    his great chance would be gone. Perhaps not once in the world's
    history had any maiden-lady, constitutionally opposed to
    betting and the race-track, given as much thought to an
    impending contest between horses on which great sums were
    certain to be won and lost, as Miss Alathea did, these
    days.</p>

    <p>And if Miss Alathea was excited, what should be said about
    the gallant Colonel? Every day he visited the Layson place;
    every day he scrutinized the mare with wise and anxious eyes;
    every day he from his soul assured her owner and her owner's
    aunt that it was quite impossible that she should lose; every
    day he cautioned Neb, her guardian, to let no human being, whom
    he did not know and whom he and his master had not every cause
    to trust implicitly, approach the splendid beast. Wise in the
    ways of race-tracks and the unscrupulous men who have,
    unfortunately, thrown the sport of kings into sad disrepute, he
    feared some treachery continually.</p>

    <p>Neb scarcely left the stable-yard, by day, unless the mare
    went with him, by night he slept so that he could, by reaching
    out a wrinkled, ebon hand, actually touch her glossy hide. He
    fed her himself with oats and hay which he examined with the
    utmost care before they found her manger or her rack; he
    watered her himself with water from a well within the stable
    and guarded by locked doors, drawn in a pail which, invariably,
    he rinsed with boiling water before he filled it up for her. No
    drugs should reach that mare if <i>he</i> could help it! None
    but himself or his "Marse Frank" was under any circumstances
    permitted to get on her back. If watchfulness could possibly
    preserve the mare unharmed and in fine shape until the day of
    the great race, Neb plainly meant to see that this was done.
    Even the amateur brass-band and glee-club into which he had
    organized the stable-boys and other negro lads about the place,
    and of which he acted as drum-major&mdash;the proudest moment
    of his life were when he donned the moth-eaten old shako which
    was his towering badge of leadership&mdash;must practice
    nowhere save within the stable-yard, where he could train them
    and, at the same time, keep watchful eyes upon Queen Bess'
    quarters.</p>

    <p>The negroes, young and old, about the place, indeed, were
    wild with their enthusiasm for the mare. The day before the
    race a delegation of them, full of eagerness, met Neb as he
    came out of the stable.</p>

    <p>"Say, Unc Neb," said one of them, "we-all's made a
    pool."</p>

    <p>"Pool on de races?"</p>

    <p>"Uh-huh! An' we-all wants to know jes' what we ought to put
    ouah money on."</p>

    <p>They well knew what he would say.</p>

    <p>"Queen Bess, fo' suah," he answered, to their vast delight.
    "Queen Bess ebery time. She's fit to run fo' huh life."</p>

    <p>The boys accepted the suggestion with a shout, and he was
    about to enter into one of the long dissertations on the strong
    points of his equine darling, when he was informed that some
    stranger was approaching. He peered down the road with his old
    eyes, but could not recognize the visitor.</p>

    <p>"Who is it?" he asked one of the black lads.</p>

    <p>"Marse Holton."</p>

    <p>"Marse Holton!" he repeated dryly. "Run along, now, honiest.
    Unc' Neb gwine be busy. I won't hab dat ar Marse Holton pryin'
    round dat mare. Hoodoo her fo' suah." He sidled to the stable
    door, and, careful to see that his bent body hid the operation
    from the coming visitor, turned the key in the big lock. The
    key he then slipped into his capacious trousers pocket.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Neb," said Holton, affably, as he came up.</p>

    <p>"Ebenin', suh." Neb added nothing to this greeting and went
    nonchalantly to a distant bench to sit down on it
    carelessly.</p>

    <p>"I say, Neb," said Holton, "I expect to do a little betting,
    so I thought I'd jest drop over and take a look at Layson's
    mare."</p>

    <p>Neb sat immovable upon his bench. At first, indeed, he did
    not even speak, but, finally, he looked at Holton calmly, took
    the key out of his pocket, tossed it in the air, caught it as
    it came down, put it back into his pocket and dryly said:
    "T'ink not, suh."</p>

    <p>Holton, paying no attention to him, had gone on to the
    stable-door and tried it. Finding it to be fast locked, he
    turned back toward the darkey. "The door's locked, Neb," he
    said.</p>

    <p>"Knowed dat afore, suh," Neb replied.</p>

    <p>Holton was nettled by his nonchalance. "Open that door!" he
    ordered.</p>

    <p>"Not widout Marse Holton's ohduhs, suh," Neb answered
    calmly.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Holton, angrily.</p>

    <p>"Jus' what I say, suh."</p>

    <p>Holton made a slightly threatening movement toward him, but
    Neb did not even wink.</p>

    <p>"Don't git riled, suh&mdash;bad fo' de livuh, suh."</p>

    <p>Holton, now, was very angry. "Look here," he said, advancing
    on the aged negro angrily. "Do you dare insult a friend and
    neighbor of Mr. Layson?"</p>

    <p>Neb slowly rose and answered with some dignity: "I dares
    obey Marse Frank's plain ohduhs, suh. Dat mare represents full
    twenty-fi' thousan' dolluhs to him" (Neb rolled the handsome
    figures lovingly upon his tongue), "an' dere's thousan's
    more'll be bet on huh to-morruh." He looked at Holton with but
    thinly veiled contempt. "Plenty men 'u'd risk deir wuthless
    lives to drug huh."</p>

    <p>"Oh, shucks!" said Holton, trying to control his temper
    because of his great eagerness to get in to the mare. "She
    would be safe with me; you know it."</p>

    <p>"I knows Marse Frank hab barred ebery window an' sealed
    ebery doah but dis one, an' gib me ohduhs to let no one in
    'cept he is by. I stan's by dem ohduhs while dere's bref in my
    ol' body."</p>

    <p>Holton was infuriated. "It's lucky for you I'm not your
    master!"</p>

    <p>"Dat's what I t'ink, suh."</p>

    <p>"If you <i>was</i> my nigger, I'd teach you perliteness with
    a black-snake whip! I'll see what Layson'll say to such sass as
    you've gin me. Jest you wait till you hear from him."</p>

    <p>Neb was not impressed by the man's wrath. "Huhd from him
    afoah, suh. Oh, I'll wait, I'll wait."</p>

    <p>He went up to the stable-door, unlocked it and stood in the
    open portal. Holton would have followed him, but Neb began to
    close the door.</p>

    <p>"You'll wait, too, suh," said the negro, grinning, "on de
    outside, suh."</p>

    <p>He closed and locked the door on the inside.</p>

    <p>Holton was beside himself with wrath. "Damn him! Damn him!"
    he exclaimed. "Damn him and damn his proud young puppy of a
    master! I'll ruin him! I'll set my foot on him and smash him,
    yet!"</p>

    <p>Baffled, he walked down the drive.</p>

    <p>"There's a way," he told himself. "It's bold and risky, but
    nobody'll suspicion me. I've kept straight here in the
    bluegrass. The mountains and all as ever knowed me thar are far
    away!"</p>

    <p>But all who had known him in the mountains were not as far
    away as he supposed. Even as he spoke a dusty, weary figure in
    worn homespun, carrying a mammoth bundle, limping sadly upon
    bruised and blistered feet, came through the shrubbery,
    approaching the great stables from the far side of the big
    house-lot. Holton looked at this wayfarer with amazement.</p>

    <p>"Madge Brierly!" he cried. "Gal, what are you a-doin'
    here?"</p>

    <p>"Don't know's I've got any call to tell you," Madge replied,
    almost as much astonished at the sight of him as he had been at
    sight of her. Then she smiled roguishly at him. "Maybe you'll
    find out, though."</p>

    <p>"I tell you this ain't no place for you," he admonished her.
    "Lordy! They takes up folks that looks like you, for vagrants.
    Take my advice, turn back to the mountings."</p>

    <p>She looked at him with that same smile, still
    unimpressed.</p>

    <p>For no reason which he could have well explained the man was
    almost panic-stricken in his keen anxiety to get the girl away
    from the old Layson homestead and the possibility of meeting
    those who dwelt therein.</p>

    <p>"Here, if you'll go," he added, and thrust his hand into his
    pocket, "I'll give you money&mdash;money to help you on your
    way."</p>

    <p>Still she smiled at him with that aggravating, meaning
    smile; that smile which he could by no means fathom and of
    which she scarcely knew the meaning. "No," she said, "I don't
    want your money. You couldn't hire me to leave the bluegrass
    till I've seen Frank Layson."</p>

    <p>Seeing that she was determined, unable to conjecture what
    she had come down for, realizing, upon second thought, that it
    was most improbable that she had any tale to tell of him, he
    reluctantly gave way. "As you will, then," he said slowly. "But
    let me warn you that you won't be welcome hyar. You'll learn
    the difference between the mounting and the bluegrass folks.
    You'd better think it over and turn back."</p>

    <p>"I'll not," said she.</p>

    <p>As he walked disgustedly away she watched him curiously. "I
    wonder why he is so sot on makin' me go back?" she mused.
    "Maybe he air right in sayin' that I won't be welcome; but I'll
    do my duty, just th' same!"</p>

    <p>Neb came out from the stable. The girl saw him with delight.
    "Dellaw!" she said. "How tired I be! Howdy, Uncle Neb;
    howdy!"</p>

    <p>"Sakes alive!" he cried. "It's de frenomenom, come down frum
    de mountains! Howdy, honey, howdy!" He hurried toward her and
    saw that she was near to tears from weariness and the strain of
    what she had gone through and what she had to tell. "Why,
    chil', what's de mattuh?"</p>

    <p>"Pebble in my shoe," she answered, and busied herself as if
    removing one. "All right in a minute. This air a long way from
    th' mountings."</p>

    <p>"Honey, you don't mean you <i>walked</i>!"</p>

    <p>"Had to. Wings ain't growed, yet. Say; I've come to bring a
    word to Mr. Frank. Is he to home?" She motioned toward the
    stable, which was the finest building she had ever seen.</p>

    <p>"Yes; but he don't lib dar, honey."</p>

    <p>"Don't he? Who does, then?"</p>

    <p>"Queen Bess."</p>

    <p>"Queen Bess!" The girl was thunderstruck; her worry choked
    her. She knew Frank owned a blooded mare, but did not know her
    name, and she had but vaguely heard of queens. "Well&mdash;air
    she to home?"</p>

    <p>"Yes; an' Marse Frank, an' Miss 'Lethe, an' Miss Barbara's
    comin', purty soon, to see huh."</p>

    <p>"Miss Barbarous!" said Madge, aroused by the mere mention of
    the girl who, from the start, she had recognized,
    instinctively, as her real enemy. It had been thought of her,
    alone, which had made her bear the weary burden of the bundle
    on the long journey from the mountains. "I'd like to fix a
    little, 'fore she comes. I got some idees o' fashion from her,
    when she was up thar, an' I been workin' ev'ry minute I could
    spare, since then, on a new dress. Ain't thar some place I can
    go to fashion up before they come?"</p>

    <p>The old negro was acutely sympathetic. He disliked Miss
    Barbara and liked the mountain girl. His old black head, thick
    as it was, sometimes, had quickly recognized the fact that
    Barbara regarded Madge as one to be despised, humiliated, while
    his master treated her with much consideration and thought
    highly of her. He did not like the daughter of Horace Holton
    any better than he liked the man himself. If he could help the
    mountain girl he would. The only place where she could possibly
    find privacy, without going to the house, was in the stable
    with the race-horse. He would have trusted no one else on earth
    with her; to distrust Madge, however, did not once occur to
    him.</p>

    <p>"Missy," he said slowly, "I reckon you can go right in dar
    wid Queen Bess."</p>

    <p>She was a bit appalled. "Maybe she wouldn't like it," she
    objected.</p>

    <p>"She won't keer if you don't go too close."</p>

    <p>"I'm kinder 'feared."</p>

    <p>"Don't gib her no chance to kick. You's all right, den."</p>

    <p>"Kick!" said the girl, amazed. Kicking did not seem to her
    to fit the character of queens.</p>

    <p>Neb unlocked the stable door. "Or bite," he added.</p>

    <p>"Bite! Dellaw!" the girl exclaimed, still more amazed. How
    little she had learned of royalty up in the mountains!</p>

    <p>The aged negro threw the door wide open. "Go in, honey, now;
    go in," he said.</p>

    <p>"I'm skeered!" she said, and tiptoed to the stable door. She
    peered in cautiously. Then she turned and faced him with
    much-puzzled eyes. "I don't see nothin' but a hoss," she
    said.</p>

    <p>"Uh-huh; dat's Queen Bess." Old Neb stood chuckling, looking
    at her.</p>

    <p>"Queen Bess is Mister Frank's race-hoss!" she cried,
    delighted by the revelation. "Well, now, I feel to home." She
    went into the stable with her bundle, half-closed the door and
    then peeped out at Neb. "You won't let any one come in?"</p>

    <p>He held the key up reassuringly. "Don't you see I's got de
    key, honey?"</p>

    <p>"I'd feel safer if I had that key myself," said she, and
    snatched it from him. An instant later and the door was closed
    and locked on the inside.</p>

    <p>Neb was alarmed. He had disobeyed plain orders in letting
    her go in at all. For him to let that key out of his possession
    was a further violation which he feared to be responsible for.
    He pounded on the door. "Open de doah, honey," he implored. "I
    mus' hab dat key!"</p>

    <p>"All right," said she, "soon's I am dressed."</p>

    <p>He fell back from the door dismayed. "De Lawd help me!" he
    groaned. "What's I gwine ter do? An' I war so mighty firm 'bout
    dat key wid Marse Holton!" He paced the space before the stable
    door in agitation. "But I reckon she'll be t'rough befo' Marse
    Frank comes," he comforted himself.</p>

    <p>She was not, though. While Neb still paced the stable yard
    in acute worry, Frank, Miss Alathea, Barbara and Holton came
    toward him in a laughing group. He almost fainted.</p>

    <p>"Here we are, Neb," his master cried, "ready for a look at
    Queen Bess."</p>

    <p>"Yessah, yessah, pwesently!" Neb stammered, and would have
    paled had nature made provision for such exhibition of his
    feelings. "I jus' nachelly hab got to speak to dem ar stable
    boys a minute, fust. Jus' 'scuse me fo' a minute, suh." He
    vanished hurriedly, hoping that by this diversion he could gain
    a little time for Madge and for himself.</p>

    <p>Layson gazed after him with some astonishment, then went and
    tried the stable door. "Of course the door's locked," he
    explained, annoyed, "but he'll be back here in a minute."</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea smiled. The attitude of the young master toward
    the aged negro often was amusing to her. She liked to watch the
    constant evidence of that rare affection which formed an
    inseparable bond between them.</p>

    <p>Suddenly she heard the crunching of a man's heavy footsteps
    on the gravel, back of them. Turning, she saw that the newcomer
    was the Colonel, and the Colonel in great haste. This was most
    impressive, for the Colonel did not often hurry.</p>

    <p>"Here comes the Colonel, Frank," she said, "and see how he
    is hurrying!"</p>

    <p>"Something's up," her nephew answered, "when the Colonel
    hurries." Then, as the horseman came up to them: "Why, Colonel,
    what's the matter?"</p>

    <p>"A shock! A regular shock! As I came from Lexington, just
    now, I saw you standing here, so I sent the boy on with the
    buggy and cut across to meet you. Just as I passed the thicket
    by the spring I caught a glimpse of a man, who then vanished
    like a ghost, but I swear that man was that lank mountaineer,
    Joe Lorey, and that he tried to keep out of my sight."</p>

    <p>"Joe Lorey!" Frank exclaimed. "What can he want down
    here?"</p>

    <p>"Who knows? Maybe to finish the work he began in the
    mountains."</p>

    <p>"More than likely," Holton ventured. "A rifleshot in the
    back, or a match touched to a building."</p>

    <p>"<i>I</i> don't believe it," Frank said stoutly. "The man
    who laid down his weapons to give me a fair, square fight,
    wouldn't stoop to things like that."</p>

    <p>"'Pears to me the man who fired that bomb 'u'd do most
    anythin'," said Holton.</p>

    <p>"That was in a fit of anger. Lorey swore to Madge that he
    thought better of his impulse to do murder, stamped upon the
    burning fuse, and believed that he had put it out, and I
    believe him."</p>

    <p>He saw, now, that his aunt was badly frightened, and
    cautioned the other men. "Not another word about him, now, at
    any rate, or Aunt 'Lethe won't once close her eyes
    to-night."</p>

    <p>"Well," said the Colonel, quite agreeing with him and
    hastening to change the subject, "here's something much more
    interesting, anyway. A letter from the Company. Looks official
    and important."</p>

    <p>Frank took the letter, opened it and gazed at it in some
    dismay. "I should think so," he exclaimed. "An assessment of
    $15,000 on my stock."</p>

    <p>"Fifteen thousand devils!"</p>

    <p>"No; fifteen thousand dollars."</p>

    <p>The Colonel took the letter from his hand and looked at it
    with worried eyes. "And you've got to meet it, Frank, or lose
    what you've put in."</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea went to her nephew anxiously. "You'll sell
    Queen Bess, now, won't you?" she implored. "You could pay it
    then. Best sell her."</p>

    <p>The young man stood there, deep in worried thought. "If I
    were quite convinced of the Company's good faith in everything,
    I'd risk it all, even the loss of Woodlawn, my old home," he
    answered.</p>

    <p>Neb now appeared from around a corner of the stable,
    evidently having decided that the girl had had enough time for
    her toilet, or afraid to wait another minute. His appearance
    created a diversion.</p>

    <p>"Here, Neb," said Frank, "we've had enough nonsense. Let's
    see Queen Bess, now."</p>

    <p>Neb looked anxiously for signs that Madge was ready to see
    visitors, he listened at the door. He saw no sign, he heard no
    signal. He was scared, but he was faithful to his promise to
    the girl. He planted his old back against the door. "Now de
    trouble am commencin'!" he assured himself.</p>

    <p>Holton looked at him with a sour smile. "I hope," he said to
    Frank, "that you'll have better luck nor me. Neb wouldn't open
    that door for me."</p>

    <p>"Dem was yo' ohduhs, suh," said Neb, appealing to his
    master.</p>

    <p>"An' he was powerful sassy in the bargain," Holton went on,
    full of malice, hoping to make Neb suffer for defying him.</p>

    <p>Layson, however, much as he was now annoyed by the old
    darky's hesitation about opening the stable door for him,
    himself, did not propose to chide him for having kept his trust
    and held it closed to others. "You mustn't mind Neb," he said
    to Holton. "He's a privileged character around here. I had told
    him to admit no one, and, as usual, he obeyed my orders
    blindly."</p>

    <p>"Yes, suh," Neb declared, delighted, "went it blind,
    suh."</p>

    <p>"His obedience," his master went on boastingly, "is really
    phenomenal. He wouldn't open that door for anybody. He'd guard
    the key with his own life." He turned to Neb. "Wouldn't you,
    now, Neb?"</p>

    <p>Neb was disconcerted. It was true enough that from most
    people he certainly would have guarded that key with his life.
    But at that moment there was one within the stable from whom he
    had <i>not</i> guarded it. "Yes&mdash;yessah!" he said
    hesitantly. And as he said it he would have given anything he
    had if he could have laid his hands upon that self-same
    key.</p>

    <p>Frank smiled at him. "But I suppose you'll let <i>me</i>
    have a look at her."</p>

    <p>"Yes&mdash;yessuh&mdash;in a&mdash;in a minute, suh."</p>

    <p>Layson was annoyed. "Why not at once?" He was beginning to
    be frightened. Could something Neb was trying to hide have
    happened to the mare?</p>

    <p>"Bekase&mdash;bekase&mdash;" Ned stammered, "well, to tell
    de trufe, suh, bekase I is afeared she ain't quite
    dressed."</p>

    <p>"Not dressed! The mare not dressed! Have you lost your
    senses? Open that door&mdash;quick!"</p>

    <p>"Marse Frank, I cain't. I nachully jus' cain't."</p>

    <p>Holton was enjoying this. "You see," he said, "he won't open
    it for nobody. Not even for th' man as owns it an' th' mare
    behind it."</p>

    <p>"Give me the key!" said Frank.</p>

    <p>"De key&mdash;de key&mdash;" Neb stammered.</p>

    <p>"I said the key!"</p>

    <p>The old negro advanced pitifully. "Fo' de lawd, Marse Frank,
    I hasn't got it!"</p>

    <p>"He'd guard it with his life!" said Holton, with deep
    sarcasm.</p>

    <p>"Where is it?" Frank demanded.</p>

    <p>"In dar," said Neb, and pointed to the stable.</p>

    <p>Layson, astonished and annoyed beyond the power of words by
    the old negro's strange performance, fearful of the safety of
    his mare, entirely puzzled, sprang toward the stable window and
    was about to pull himself up by the ledge so that he might look
    in.</p>

    <p>Neb seized him and pulled him from the aperture with a
    desperate agility which strained his aged limbs. "Fo' de Lawd's
    sake, now, Marse Frank," he cried, "don't yo' dare look t'rough
    dat stable winder!"</p>

    <p>Frank, now, was badly frightened. "Is there some one in
    there with Queen Bess?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"A young pusson to see you, suh," Neb admitted.</p>

    <p>"And you let that person have the key?"</p>

    <p>"No, suh; it were taken from me."</p>

    <p>Layson was in panic. "Heaven knows," he exclaimed, "what can
    have happened here!" He rushed to the stable door and pounded
    on it with his fists. "Open at once, or I'll break in the
    door," he cried.</p>

    <p>Neb, now, had gone up to the window and looked through it
    with desperate glance. What he saw was reassuring. He turned
    back toward his master smiling. "Hol' on, Marse Frank, de young
    pusson am a-comin' out," he said.</p>

    <p>"Well," said Layson, threateningly, "I'm ready for him." He
    braced himself to spring upon some malefactor.</p>

    <p>The door opened and Madge appeared before their astonished
    eyes, garbed in a gown which she had fashioned after that which
    Barbara had worn up in the hills.</p>

    <p>"Madge!" cried Frank, amazed.</p>

    <p>The Colonel, laughing, approached the girl with outstretched
    hand; Neb, relieved, dived through the stable door; Miss
    Alathea, who had been under a great strain while the dramatic
    little scene had been in progress, dropped limply on Neb's
    bench.</p>

    <p>Madge, with a retentive memory of the way Miss "Barbarous"
    had greeted her back in the mountains, stepped toward that
    much-astonished maiden, opened her red parasol straight in her
    face, and courtesied to the rest.</p>

    <p>"Howdy, folks; howdy!" she said, happily.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2><br>


    <p>The party stood, nonplussed. Frank was first to show signs
    of recovery, and, after a moment of completely dazed
    astonishment, advanced to Madge with hand outstretched. Her
    appearance, astonishing as it had been, had been as great a
    relief as he had ever known in all his life. Neb's worry and
    insubordination had filled him with the keenest apprehension.
    But he had no doubts of Madge. If she had been there with the
    mare, the mare was certainly all right, no matter how puzzling
    the affair might seem to be upon its surface.</p>

    <p>"Why, little one, this is, indeed, a great surprise and
    pleasure!" he exclaimed, with sincere gallantry.</p>

    <p>Madge looked at him with doubtful eyes, from which the
    doubt, however, was fast clearing. "Oh, say; are you-uns r'ally
    glad to see me?"</p>

    <p>"No one could be more welcome," he assured her, and the
    honest pleasure in his eyes convinced her that he did not speak
    for mere politeness' sake.</p>

    <p>And now Miss Alathea, recovering from the shock of all that
    had preceded the girl's unexpected appearance, went to her
    cordially. "We are more than glad, my child," she told her.</p>

    <p>"Glad's no name for it," the gallant Colonel said, advancing
    in his turn.</p>

    <p>There could be no doubt of the sincerity of any one who,
    thus far, had expressed a welcome for her; but the voice which
    now came coldly from Miss Barbara was less convincing. She did
    not approach the mountain girl, but sat somewhat superciliously
    upon a bench and spoke frigidly. "It is an unexpected
    pleasure."</p>

    <p>Madge, not trained to hide her feelings under softened
    words, turned on her angrily. "Humph! I wasn't askin' you," she
    said. Then, to the others: "I didn't know but what my droppin'
    in, permiskus like&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"A Kentuckian's friends," said Frank, "are always
    welcome."</p>

    <p>"Friends from the word go, remember," said the Colonel.</p>

    <p>"Thankee, Colonel," said the girl. "We'll have that race,
    some day; but I won't ride agin you if you ride Queen Bess. Oh,
    wouldn't I like to see her go!"</p>

    <p>"So you shall," said Frank. "Neb, is she ready?"</p>

    <p>"Yessuh; all saddled, sur, an' bridled."</p>

    <p>"Oh, let me bring her out," cried Madge. "I'd love to."</p>

    <p>"Lawsy, honey," said the negro, "you couldn't bring her out.
    She's dat fretful an' dat nervous dat she'd kill yo',
    suah."</p>

    <p>"Get out, Neb!" Madge cried, scornfully. "I ain't afeard of
    her. Wild things allays has made friends with me. I've never
    seen a horse so skeery that I couldn't manage
    him&mdash;couldn't make him foller me."</p>

    <p>She pushed the hesitating Neb out of her path and went into
    the stable.</p>

    <p>Layson, who was for the moment, at a distance, had not heard
    all her talk with Neb, but saw her as she went into the stall
    where none but he, himself, and Neb, dared go, and it was
    stable talk that, soon or late, Queen Bess would prove to be a
    man killer!</p>

    <p>"Neb, stop her! She'll be killed!" he cried.</p>

    <p>Neb ran, as fast as his old legs would carry him, into the
    stable; Frank hurried to the stable door.</p>

    <p>"Madge! Madge!" he cried, and then: "Why&mdash;look! The
    mare is following her as might a kitten!"</p>

    <p>He stepped aside and Madge came from the stable with Queen
    Bess behind her, ears pricked forward eagerly as she kept her
    eyes on Madge's pursed up, cooing lips, head dropped, neck
    stretched in graceful fashion, lifting her dainty feet as
    proudly as ever did the queen whom she was named for.</p>

    <p>"Come on, you beauty!" the girl cried. "Oh, it would be like
    heaven to ride you; and I could do it, too!"</p>

    <p>"Take her to the track, Neb," Layson ordered. "I'll follow
    and give her her exercise."</p>

    <p>Madge, unable to resist the impulse which was thrilling her
    with longing, motioned Neb away as he approached to take the
    mare. "Go 'way! Go 'way!" she said. Then, to the mare: "Come
    on, you dear, come on." She went on slowly, while the mare, in
    calm docility, trailed after her. The spectators, who knew the
    beast, gazed spellbound.</p>

    <p>Constantly the girl's pleased eyes were on the beautiful
    creature following. Never had she seen so perfect an animal;
    never had she known one giving such plain signs of high
    intelligence. The mare's big eyes, broad forehead, delicate
    muzzle, arching neck, strong withers, mighty flanks, and
    slender ankles marked her, to the veriest novice, a
    thoroughbred of thoroughbreds; her docile and obedient march
    showed what seemed like an almost magic power in the delighted
    mountain maid. Every drop of blood in the girl's body tingled
    with excitement, all her muscles thrilled with mad desire to
    mount the wondrous beast and be away as on the wind's wings.
    She could imagine what the mare's long strides would be, she
    could imagine how exhilerating she would find the steady,
    perfect motion of the mighty back.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I can't stand it!" she exclaimed, at length. "I've got
    to do it!"</p>

    <p>She paused, and eagerly the mare stepped up to her,
    nuzzleing her caressing hand. Then, with a bound, the girl was
    on the graceful creature's back, landing in her place as
    lightly as a wind-blown thistle-down, as gracefully as a fairy
    horsewoman.</p>

    <p>"Heavens!" cried Barbara. "She's on Queen Bess!"</p>

    <p>"She'll be killed!" Miss Alathea screamed, in terror.</p>

    <p>The Colonel, only, recognized her instantly as a born
    horsewoman. His expert eye observed with rare delight the ease
    with which she mounted, the perfect poise with which she found
    her seat, the absolute adjustment of her lithe young motions to
    the movements of the mare beneath her from the very moment she
    had reached her back.</p>

    <p>"No danger; she rides like a centaur."</p>

    <p>With the others he had stopped, with eyes for nothing but
    the girl before them and the splendid animal she rode. "Ah,
    what a jockey she would make!"</p>

    <p>Barbara liked this exhibition of the mountain girl's
    abilities no better than she had liked anything which Madge had
    done. Her lip curled somewhat scornfully. "What a pity that her
    sex should bar her from that vocation!" she said coldly.</p>

    <p>She turned to Frank, who was watching Madge with startled
    eyes, worried as to the result of this mad prank on both the
    girl and mare.</p>

    <p>"Frank," said Barbara, "what a figure she will make to-night
    at your lawn-party! How your friends will laugh at her!"</p>

    <p>Layson cast a quick, sharp glance at her. She was not
    advancing her own cause by trying, thus, to ridicule the
    mountain maiden. "I'll run the risk," he said. "She is my
    guest, you know, and, as such, will surely be given every
    consideration and courtesy by all."</p>

    <p>"Oh, certainly," said Barbara, seeing that she had gone,
    perhaps, too far. "If you wish it. I should be glad to please
    you, once again."</p>

    <p>"Nothing could please me more than to have you show her what
    kindnesses you can. I know she will feel strange and
    worried."</p>

    <p>Madge, sitting Queen Bess with an ease and grace which that
    intelligent mare had never found in any other rider, and, now,
    far from them at the other end of the great training-field,
    absorbed the youth's delighted glances.</p>

    <p>"Can't you forget her for an instant?" exclaimed Barbara.
    "You haven't been at all the same since you came back from the
    mountains! Once we were always together. Now I never see you
    unless I come over here; and no matter what I do, you don't
    seem to care."</p>

    <p>Layson was uneasy. He had been aware, for a long time, that,
    sooner or later, a complete understanding of his changed
    feelings toward this girl, must, in some way, be accomplished.
    Now seemed a good time for it, yet he hesitated at the thought
    of it. But the thing had to be gone through with. "I know I
    used to play the tyrant, Barbara; but it wasn't a pleasant
    r&ocirc;le, and I was always half-ashamed of it."</p>

    <p>The girl flared into a passion. "What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Barbara, I have had no right to go so far, no right to ask
    so much of you. From the bottom of my heart I beg forgiveness.
    Let us forget it all and just be friends again." And, even as
    he spoke, his eyes were wandering toward the girl whom Queen
    Bess had so utterly surrendered to. The mare, known since she
    had first been saddled, as a terror to all riders, was carrying
    her as gently as the veriest country hack had ever borne an old
    lady from the farm to market.</p>

    <p>Barbara saw where his attention was, and resentment thrilled
    her. "Friends? Never! Frank Layson, I believe I hate you!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, very well," said he, plainly not too much impressed,
    "if you want to be unreasonable, why, of course&mdash;"</p>

    <p>The girl was frightened at the length to which she had
    permitted her ill-temper to carry her. "Oh, no, Frank," she
    hastily corrected, "I didn't mean that. Of course I am your
    friend."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Barbara," said he, with a calmness which was
    maddening to her. "I am sure we understand each other, now."
    And then, still further maddening her: "I must go now, and look
    after Madge and dear Queen Bess. I never should forgive myself
    if anything should happen to the girl. But nothing will. See
    how splendidly she rides!"</p>

    <p>The girl upon the horse, as if conscious of his anxiety
    about her, now turned her mount back toward the field-end where
    the onlookers were loosely grouped and came toward them at a
    slow and gentle canter&mdash;a gait which none had ever seen
    Queen Bess take before, when a stranger was upon her back. She
    leaped from the mare by Layson's side, and Neb, ever anxious
    for the welfare of his equine darling, began work without delay
    at rubbing Queen Bess down.</p>

    <p>"Reckon you'll never forgive me," Madge apologized to
    Layson, "but I just couldn't help it. Never even saw a mare
    like her, afore. My pony's no-whar alongside of her. I felt
    like an angel sittin' on a cloud an' sailin' straight to
    heaven!" She turned and petted the black beauty. "Oh, you
    darling!"</p>

    <p>"Got to take her in, now," Neb said, preparing to lead the
    mare away. He spoke apologetically as if the girl had rights
    which, now, should be consulted. He had never made a like
    concession in the past to anyone except his master.</p>

    <p>"Go 'way, go 'way," said Madge, taking the reins from his
    black hand. "Ain't no use o' leadin' her&mdash;you jest watch
    her foller me!"</p>

    <p>She looped the reins about the mare's arched neck, started
    off, and, without so much as flicking her long tail, Queen Bess
    fell in behind, obedient to her cooing, murmurous calls.</p>

    <p>Frank laughed. "If," he said to the whole party, "you wish
    to have a look at the mare's quarters, I think Neb will now
    admit us."</p>

    <p>All but the Colonel started toward the stable, but he
    hesitated, looking toward Miss Alathea. While the others had
    been spellbound by the girl and horse, he, the most
    enthusiastic horseman of them all, had been divided in
    attention between them and the lady whose notice he attracted,
    now, by means of sundry hems and haws.</p>

    <p>"Miss 'Lethe, just a moment," he said softly. She paused and
    then went up to him. He held out a newspaper, suddenly at a
    loss for words, now that there was a prospect of a moment with
    her wholly uninterrupted. "Here," said he, a little panicky,
    "is a full account of the revival, sermon and all. Make your
    hair stand on end to read it."</p>

    <p>She took the paper, undeceived by his small subterfuge to
    gain attention, but interested, as she always was in such
    things, in the account of the revival. "This really is
    interesting." She sat down on the bench, as they reached the
    stable-yard again, and pored above the newspaper.</p>

    <p>In the meantime the Colonel tried to screw his courage to
    the sticking point. "Colonel Sandusky Doolittle," he adjured
    himself, "if you don't say it now, then you forever hold your
    peace, that's all!" He went to his buggy, which had been
    brought to the stable yard, and from underneath its seat took a
    box containing a bouquet of sweet, old-fashioned flowers. Miss
    Alathea, absorbed in the account of the revival, did not notice
    him at all. "This will do the business," he reflected. "Now,
    Sandusky Doolittle, keep cool, keep cool!" Nervously, as he
    gazed at her, his fingers worked among the flowers,
    dismembering them unconsciously. "A Kentucky Colonel," he was
    saying to himself in scorn, "afraid of a woman!" His fingers
    tore the flowers with new activity as his nervousness
    increased, making sad work with the magnificent bouquet. "Of
    course she is an angel," he reflected, and then, with a grim
    humor, "or will be before I ask her, if I wait another twenty
    years! But I shall ask her, I shall ask her!" He stepped toward
    her boldly, but paused before her in a wordless panic when he
    had approached within a yard. "Heavens!" he thought. "My heart
    is going at a one-forty gait and the jockey's lost the reins.
    I'll be over the fence in another minute if I don't hold tight!
    But I have got to do it, this time." He dropped the stems of
    the flowers, still bound together by their lengths of wide
    white ribbon, into the elaborate box from which, so lately, he
    had taken them in their uninjured beauty, not noting the sad
    wreck which his too nervous fingers had produced, put on the
    cover and approached still nearer. With the box held toward her
    bashfully, he managed, then, another step or two. "Miss
    'Lethe," he said stammering, "lawn party to-night&mdash;bouquet
    for you&mdash;brought it from Lexington&mdash;for you&mdash;for
    you, you know."</p>

    <p>The Colonel never was embarrassed save when he was
    endeavoring to propose marriage to Miss Alathea and he always
    was embarrassed then. She recognized the situation from the
    mere tone of his voice and looked up hopefully.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Colonel, how kind!" said she, as she held delighted
    hands out for the box. "I know it is beautiful."</p>

    <p>"It was quite the best I could do, Miss 'Lethe," said the
    Colonel.</p>

    <p>"You have such splendid taste! I'm sure it's lovely." She
    opened the box and looked, expectantly, within. "Why, Colonel,"
    she cried, disappointed, "where are&mdash;where are the
    flowers?"</p>

    <p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;why," he stammered, and then saw the
    mutilated blossoms on the ground around him. "Why, I don't
    know&mdash;don't know," said he. "'Don't ask me."</p>

    <p>She was rummaging among the stems, nonplussed. "Why, here's
    a note!" she said.</p>

    <p>"Thank heaven!" the Colonel thought, "the note's there yet!"
    Then, growing bold: "Miss 'Lethe, if you've a kindly feeling
    for me in your heart, read that note; but don't you get
    excited; keep cool, keep cool!"</p>

    <p>"Why, certainly," said she. "I see no cause for excitement."
    She unfolded the note and read, aloud, and very slowly, for the
    Colonel's hand was not too easy to decipher. "'My dear, dear
    Miss 'Lethe: Woman without her man is a savage.'" She looked
    up, naturally astonished by this unusual statement. "Why,
    Colonel," she exclaimed, "what can you mean by saying woman is
    a savage without her man?"</p>

    <p>He stood appalled for just a second and then realized the
    error into which his ardor had misled him. "Great Scott!" he
    cried. "I forgot to put in the commas! It ought to read this
    way: 'Woman, without her, man is a savage.' Go on, Miss 'Lethe,
    please go on."</p>

    <p>She read again: "'I feel that it is time for me to become
    civilized&mdash;in other words, to come in out of the wet. To
    me you have been, for twenty years, the embodiment of woman's
    truth, purity and goodness. But constitutional timidity and
    chronic financial depression, due to the race-track, have
    hitherto kept me silent.'" Miss 'Lethe looked up at him with a
    strange expression on her face. "Colonel," she exclaimed, "what
    does this mean?"</p>

    <p>"Go on, Miss 'Lethe," was the answer, "please go on, go on."
    He made a mighty effort to secure control of his unruly nerves,
    and, almost unconsciously, while her head was bent above the
    note, took a small flask from his pocket and imbibed from it.
    It steadied him.</p>

    <p>She read again: "'I am convinced that my interest in the
    company will yield me a competence; accordingly, behold me at
    your feet!'"</p>

    <p>Miss 'Lethe looked down somewhat mischievously. She did not
    see the Colonel where his note declared he would be. She
    glanced again at the paper in her hands and saw a word which,
    at first, had quite escaped attention. "'Metaphorically,'" she
    read, and then the signature: "'Colonel Sandusky
    Doolittle.'"</p>

    <p>"Colonel!" she exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"Miss 'Lethe," he replied, and, discovering that the flask
    was still in plain view in his hand, slipped it into his
    sidepocket upside down.</p>

    <p>"Colonel, put that bottle right side up and listen to me,"
    she said calmly. "Do you really love me?"</p>

    <p>"Do I love you? With a
    fervor&mdash;er&mdash;a&mdash;passion&mdash;er&mdash;will you
    excuse me if I smoke?" He took a black cigar from his vest
    pocket, in another effort to control his nerves, and lighted it
    as might an automatic smoker.</p>

    <p>"I am going to put you to the proof," said she. "Could you,
    for my sake, come down from ten cigars a day to five?"</p>

    <p>The Colonel was dismayed. "To five cigars a day!
    Impossible!" He caught himself. That scarcely was the way to
    answer the request of the woman he adored so fervently. "I
    mean," he hastily corrected, "is&mdash;is that all?" He made a
    motion as if to throw away the weed he had just lighted, but
    thought better of it. "I will make the descent to-morrow," he
    said earnestly.</p>

    <p>"Could you restrict yourself to three mint-julips,
    daily?"</p>

    <p>"Three! A man couldn't live on three! He'd have
    to&mdash;have to take such poisons as&mdash;as cold water into
    his system."</p>

    <p>"Remember, Colonel, I would mix them."</p>

    <p>"That settles it! Three goes!" He fervently reached toward
    her, plainly planning to embrace her.</p>

    <p>"Wait, Colonel," she exclaimed, "there is one more
    condition. Could you, for my sake, promise never to enter
    another race-track?"</p>

    <p>He started back from her in horror. "Never enter another
    race-tack! I, Colonel Sandusky Doolittle, known everywhere,
    from Maine to California, as a plunger, give up the absorbing
    passion of my life!"</p>

    <p>"Remember what you said to Frank," said she. "'It's a
    delusion and a snare.' But, of course, if you think more of a
    delusion than you do of me&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"No; hang it!" cried the Colonel, "I think more of you.
    Twenty years&mdash;the longest race on record and a win in
    sight! I'll not lose by a balk at the finish! I promise you,
    Miss 'Lethe, on the honor of a Kentuckian."</p>

    <p>"Then, Colonel, I must confess, I have loved you, also, for
    every one of those long twenty years."</p>

    <p>"Twenty years!" He turned his head aside and muttered: "What
    a damned fool I have been!" Then, to her, he said, exultantly:
    "Aha! A neck ahead!"</p>

    <p>It is difficult to say what would have happened, then, if
    Madge, Holton, Barbara and Frank had not come from the stable,
    chattering about Queen Bess.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2><br>


    <p>Joe Lorey, mad with wrath, his heart filled with the lust of
    killing for revenge, infuriated to the point where he felt need
    of neither food nor sleep, yet made less rapid time down the
    rough mountain paths than had the girl. Love-lent wings are
    swifter than an impulse born of hatred and resentment can be.
    She had flown upon such wings to save the man who filled her
    innocent thoughts with longing; Joe had gone clumsily, despite
    his cunning as a mountaineer, for leaden, murderous thoughts
    had weighed him down, hampering the quickness of his wit,
    delaying his fleet feet, confusing the alertness of his
    watchfulness for faint-limned trails, loose areas perilous of
    slides upon steep slopes. Indeed, though hate had driven him,
    Joe Lorey never in his life had made so very slow a journey to
    the bluegrass as that which he had started on from his wrecked
    still, with hatred of Frank Layson, who he thought had
    viciously betrayed him, blazing in his heart.</p>

    <p>Hours after the light-footed girl, spurred by her fear for
    one whom she but dimly guessed that she had learned to love,
    had arrived at the bluegrass mansion and been welcomed by the
    owner of Queen Bess, the mountaineer reached the confines of
    the splendid farm, and lurked there, waiting for night-fall to
    make his entrance into the house grounds safe.</p>

    <p>The rough youth's mental state was pitiable. Tragedy had
    pursued him, almost from his life's beginning, he reflected, as
    he furtively awaited opportunity for the revenge which he had
    planned. The fierce feud of the mountains had robbed him of his
    parents, and, with them, of the best years of his youth; the
    rough life of the mountains had robbed his strong young manhood
    of those opportunities which, he dimly realized, might have
    made him different and better; when love for sweet Madge
    Brierly had come to him, Fate had brought up from the bluegrass
    the young stranger, who, with his superior learning, polished
    manner and smooth speech, had found the conquest of the girl
    (Joe bitterly reflected) all too easy; and finally had come the
    crowning, black disaster&mdash;the betrayal of his still to the
    agents of the government, its destruction and his
    transformation from a free man of the mountains into a furtive
    outlaw.</p>

    <p>He could not see that life held anything but gloom for
    him&mdash;black, impenetrable, ever thickening. He had but one
    thing left to live for&mdash;a revenge as dark as were the
    wrongs which he had suffered.</p>

    <p>He knew that government agents have shrewd wits, keen eyes,
    strong arms, and never let a moonshiner escape if, through any
    strategy, they may bring about his capture; he knew that since
    the discovery and destruction of his still he was a marked man;
    so it was nearing dusk when, after intensely cautious and
    immensely skilful manoeuvering against discovery, he actually
    entered the Layson grounds.</p>

    <p>The long, exciting afternoon, full of Queen Bess, a certain
    sense of triumph over Barbara Holton, the extent of which she
    could not guess, countless thrills of gratitude and exultation
    born of the kindness and consideration shown her by Miss
    Alathea and the Colonel, had sped away before Madge realized
    that it had been half-spent. Now, though, the deepening
    twilight warned her of the flight of time and told her that she
    must, perforce, perform the task for which she had descended
    from the mountains.</p>

    <p>All the others except Frank had drifted toward the house,
    and she had hung behind for the express purpose of getting
    private speech with him, when she had the day's first
    opportunity.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Frank," said she, "afore we go into th' house I got a
    word to say to you as I don't want nobody but you to hear."</p>

    <p>A quick glance at her face showed him that what she had to
    say was, really, of great importance, for her lovely mouth was
    serious, her deep eyes were full of worry, her smooth brow was
    nearer to real frowning than he had ever seen it.</p>

    <p>"Why, Madge, what is the matter?"</p>

    <p>She put her hand upon his arm, turning her sweet face up to
    him with a revelation of solicitude which, had she known how
    plain it was, she would have hidden at all hazard. "It may mean
    life or death to you," she told him solemnly.</p>

    <p>"Life or death to me, little girl? What are you talking of?"
    said he, almost incredulous.</p>

    <p>"Joe Lorey's still were raided by the revenuers after you
    come down!"</p>

    <p>"It can't be possible!"</p>

    <p>"It is. It lies in ruins and in ashes an' he is hidin' out
    among th' mountings, somewhars, in danger, ev'ry minute, of
    arrest an', then, of prison. 'Twas all he had in th' wide
    world."</p>

    <p>"Poor fellow! I am sorry," said Layson, with quick sympathy.
    "I'll see what can be done. And you say he's hiding out up in
    the mountains?"</p>

    <p>She hesitated. "I said so, but I reckon it ain't true,
    exactly. It was that that made me hurry down to speak to you.
    Some say as how he has come down into th' bluegrass to find th'
    man as gin th' word. It is a crime as never is forgiven in th'
    mountings."</p>

    <p>As she spoke, unseen, behind them, a dark, slouching,
    furtive figure slipped across an open space and took a
    crouching stand behind a tree near by. Had they listened
    without speech they might have heard the heavy breathing of the
    very man of whom they spoke, might have heard the sharp click
    of the lock of his long rifle as he brought its hammer to full
    cock. Had they turned about they might have seen the blue glint
    of the day's last light upon that rifle's barrel, which was
    levelled straight at Layson's heart. But they saw none of these
    things nor heard a sound.</p>

    <p>"Who does he think betrayed him?" Layson asked, with deep
    interest, but no trace of guilty knowledge, thrilling in his
    voice.</p>

    <p>Madge hesitated. Then she blurted out the truth. "Who?" she
    repeated, "Why&mdash;why you! <i>YOU</i>&mdash;YOU!"</p>

    <p>The rifle barrel steadied to its mark, the finger curled to
    press upon the trigger.</p>

    <p>"Why, Madge," said Layson, earnestly, "I didn't even know he
    had a still! I swear it!"</p>

    <p>There was an honest ring in the youth's voice which could
    not be mistaken.</p>

    <p>"I knowed it warn't your doin'," the girl said with a great
    sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>And as she spoke the rifle barrel slowly fell.</p>

    <p>"I knowed it warn't your doin', but Joe'll never believe it.
    Night an' day you'll have to be close on your guard. There's no
    tellin' what minute your life may be in danger."</p>

    <p>"I don't believe it of Joe Lorey," Layson answered
    earnestly. "We fought, and he fought fair."</p>

    <p>After they had gone, Joe crept out from his hiding place
    among the shrubbery and looked after them with puzzled,
    pain-filled eyes, like a great animal's.</p>

    <p>"If they'd only knowed that I war standin' in th' shadder
    there!" he mused. "If he hadn't spoke them words I'd pulled th'
    trigger, but he spoke up like as ef 't war true an' I jest
    couldn't do it."</p>

    <p>A cautious footstep on the close-knit sward, which would
    have been inaudible to any ear less keen than his, attracted
    his attention, suddenly, and he slipped back to his leafy
    hiding-place. Peering from the covert he saw Holton coming. The
    man was furtive, apprehensive in his every movement, suspicion
    breeding. When Joe stepped out from his thicket boldly, to
    confront him, the ex-slave-dealer fell back, frightened.</p>

    <p>"Hello, sir," was Joe's laconic greeting.</p>

    <p>"Joe Lorey!" exclaimed Holton.</p>

    <p>"That's me," Joe boldly granted. He peered at him so closely
    that Holton shrank away from him, involuntarily. "And
    you&mdash;why you're the man as gin th' word that Frank Layson
    had warned th' revenooers of my still."</p>

    <p>"I told ye for yer good," said Holton, clearly recognizing
    that his position was unfortunate. "An' recollect you promised
    not to tell anyone my name."</p>

    <p>Joe nodded gravely. "While I believe ye told th' truth I'll
    keep my word," he answered. "But I wants to tell you that I
    heered Frank Layson deny it, hyar, to-night, an' it sounded
    like he war speakin' th' plain truth. See hyar, sir, you nearly
    egged me on to doin' murder." He reached forward and seized
    Holton by the shoulder roughly, with a grasp so powerful that
    the old man, though he was of sturdy frame and mighty muscle,
    knew that he was helpless in the grip. "Now look me in th'
    face. Tell me as you vally your own life&mdash;war it truth or
    lies, you told me?"</p>

    <p>"It war th' truth," said Holton, doggedly; "th' truth an'
    nothin' else."</p>

    <p>Joe shook his head incredulously. "I'd like better proof nor
    your word, stranger, for, some way, your voice it don't ring
    true, nor yer eye look honest."</p>

    <p>"I'll gin ye th' proof," said Holton desperately. "Ye know
    that I war never near yer still. Layson told me it war in th'
    wall of a ravine&mdash;Hangin' Rock Ravine&mdash;an' a big oak
    stood in front of it an' hid the mouth o' th' cave. Thar, do ye
    believe me, now?"</p>

    <p>Joe nodded, slowly, thoughtfully. "No man as lived up in th'
    mountings would have told ye." He considered ponderously for a
    moment. "Yes, I reckon that I'll have to take yer word. 'T was
    him as done it."</p>

    <p>"Of course it war," said Holton, and then, perhaps, a bit
    too eagerly: "an' you'll make him pay for it?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Joe, "but I've another score to settle, first,
    another man to find&mdash;Lem Lindsay."</p>

    <p>Holton was plainly startled, although Joe could not guess
    just why he should be. "Lem Lindsay!" he exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"Yes; the man as murdered my father. I've had word of him,
    at last. I've heard as how he war seen, years ago, in New
    Orleans&mdash;he war a nigger-trader, then&mdash;an' that he's
    come up in th' bluegrass country, since, like enough under
    another name." He looked at Holton eagerly. "I say, sir, you
    don't know a man like that, do you?"</p>

    <p>Holton spoke a little hurriedly. "No, no; there ain't no man
    like that in these parts."</p>

    <p>"It don't make no differ whar he bides," said Joe. "Soon or
    late our paths'll cross an' bring us face to face. When he
    struck down my father it war sealed and signed above that he
    war to fall by my hand; an' there's a feelin' in my heart that
    that hour air drawin' nigh." He nodded and then turned away.
    "Good-night, stranger."</p>

    <p>Holton was thoroughly alarmed. Many things distressed him.
    He could plainly see that his daughter's love-affair with
    Layson had gone wrong, he realized that there was little chance
    that he could buy Madge Brierly's coal lands at anything but a
    fair value, and now&mdash;to fall by his hand!</p>

    <p>"I'll make that false," he muttered, "Why, I've got to do
    it!"</p>

    <p>He moved away among the trees, but stopped in frequent
    thought as he progressed.</p>

    <p>"They'll lay the crime on Lorey," he reflected, after he had
    laid his plan. "They'll hunt him down and lynch him and I shall
    be safe. Layson'll be ruined, he'll have to sell Woodlawn, and
    my gal'll be th' missus there, in spite of him. I've got to do
    it."</p>

    <p>Like a shadow of the night he hurried through the grounds
    until he reached the stable where Queen Bess was thought to be
    secure.</p>

    <p>"Every window barred, every door is sealed but this!" he
    cunningly reflected as he paused at the front entrance.</p>

    <p>With frantic haste, lest he should be discovered at the
    work, he piled brush from a near refuse pile against the door
    and stuffed wisps of grass and hay into the bottom of the heap.
    Into this tinder pile he thrust a lighted match and
    disappeared, just as Madge came to the bench where she had
    paused when she first came to Woodlawn, early in the
    afternoon.</p>

    <p>It was plain enough, from her dejected looks and listless
    attitude, that the dance had given her no pleasure, but, on the
    contrary, had filled her with distress.</p>

    <p>"I couldn't stand it thar, no longer," she was thinking,
    bitterly. "I war jest a curiosity, like a wild woman. Miss
    Barbarous poked fun at me till I war plumb afraid I'd fly at
    her like a wild-cat, so I jest slipped away. Oh, I see, now, as
    I never seed afore; the differ that there is 'twixt Mr. Frank
    an' me! An' I know, now, what 't is air ailin' me. I loves him.
    Oh, I loves him better nor my life! But it can't never be." She
    dropped her head into her hands and sobbed. "Good-bye, good,
    kind, Mr. Frank, good-bye!" She stretched her arms out toward
    the mansion she had lately left, where lights were twinkling
    gaily, whence sounds of music now came faintly to her ears.
    "You'll soon forget the little mounting girl. You'll never know
    she loved you. I'm goin' back&mdash;back to the old
    mountings."</p>

    <p>As she rose an ominous crackling caught her ear and held her
    at attention, then, in a horrid flash, the fire blazed out
    among the hay and brush which Holton had piled up against the
    stable door.</p>

    <p>"Oh, oh!" she cried. "Th' stable is burnin'! Fire! Fire!
    Fire! Neb, are you in there? Don't you hear me, Neb? Th' stable
    air on fire!"</p>

    <p>Neb's voice came from the dim interior, muffled and
    skeptical. "What dat?" he said. "Don't want no foolishness
    'round heah. I's ahmed."</p>

    <p>"It's me, Neb, me," she cried. "Th' stable 's burnin',
    Neb!"</p>

    <p>"Gorramighty!" she heard Neb exclaim, now in a voice
    expressive of great fright. "Dat's so, dat's so! Quick, honey,
    open up de doah!"</p>

    <p>Madge was working at the biggest log which Holton had thrust
    against the door to feed the blaze. The flames and smoke surged
    'round her as she struggled with the unwieldy thing, her hands
    grasped, more than once, live coals, without making her release
    her hold. Once or twice the bursting flames, swung hither and
    swung yon by the light, vagrant breezes of the night and the
    drafts born of the fire, itself, flared straight toward her
    face, and, to save her hair, which, once igniting, would, she
    knew, make further work impossible, she had to draw back for a
    second; but each time, as she saw another chance, she sprang
    again to the desperate task. At last, after a dozen efforts,
    she had thrust the blazing log so far from the already burning
    door that Neb could push it open. He stumbled out, his old
    hands held before him, gropingly, half-suffocated.</p>

    <p>"Neb, you ain't hurt," said she.</p>

    <p>"You go ring dat bell," said he, pointing to a standard
    bearing at its top an ornamental iron crotch in which a big
    plantation bell was swung. "Soon's I get my bref from all dat
    smoke I'll go back an' git Queen Bess."</p>

    <p>The girl sprang to the rope and soon the bell was ringing
    out a wild alarm.</p>

    <p>"Hurry, Neb!" she cried. "Oh, hurry! Th' fire's a-gainin',
    ev'ry second! Hurry!"</p>

    <p>Neb dashed back into the stable upon trembling limbs, while,
    without a pause, the girl kept up the clangor of alarm. Her
    eyes were ever on the door through which the faithful black had
    disappeared, watching anxiously to see him come out with the
    mare.</p>

    <p>But second after second&mdash;seconds which seemed to her
    like hours&mdash;went by and he did not appear again. Her heart
    began to beat with frantic fears that Neb, himself, as well as
    the superb animal which she had already learned to love, had
    fallen victim to the fire, when, at last, he stumbled from the
    door.</p>

    <p>"'Tain't no use," he said, as he weakly staggered up to her.
    "It kain't be done. Queen Bess am crazy wid de fiah. She jes'
    won't come out! I cain't <i>git</i> huh to come out." He
    sobbed. "An' she am all dat Marse Frank hab on earth!" Beside
    himself he ran off toward the house, shouting for his master
    wildly.</p>

    <p>"All he has on earth!" the girl exclaimed, the bell-rope
    falling from relaxing hands. An instant she stood there in
    thought, horrified at the idea of the catastrophe which
    threatened Layson. Then: "I'll save her! She will follow
    me!"</p>

    <p>Without a second's hesitation, with no thought for her own
    safety, she drew her skirts about her tightly, wrapped her
    shawl around her head to save her hair and dashed through the
    growing flames about the stable-door, into the inferno which
    now raged within the structure, just as Neb, running with a
    lurching step, but with a speed remarkable in one so old and
    stiffened by rheumatic pains, dashed back to the scene of the
    disaster, in advance of Frank, the Colonel, Holton, Miss
    Alathea and the other inmates of the house, guests, servants,
    all.</p><a name="Illus_4"></a> <br>

    </center><br>
     <br>
    <br>


    <p>Without a word, as he approached, Frank pulled off his coat,
    evidently preparing for a desperate dash through the now
    roaring flames to rescue his beloved mare. Then, bracing
    himself for a great spring through the lurid barrier, he cried,
    "I'll save her!" and would have leaped into the flaming
    entrance if Neb had not caught his arm with desperate grip.</p>

    <p>"No, honey," the old negro cried, "yo' shan't go in!"</p>

    <p>The Colonel joined the negro in restraining the half-crazed
    owner of Queen Bess. "It's no use, Frank," said he. "We'll not
    let you go in."</p>

    <p>They dragged the struggling youth back from the fire just
    as, to their amazement, an exultant voice rang from the inside
    of the burning building. "Back! Back!" it cried. "I'm a-comin'
    with Queen Bess!"</p>

    <p>An instant later Madge sprang out through the flames,
    followed by the mare, about whose head the mountain girl had
    wrapped her shawl.</p>

    <p>"Come, girl! Come, girl!" said Madge, alert of eye,
    cool-witted, soothing.</p>

    <p>As docilely as she had followed her that afternoon, the mare
    stepped through the blazing door and out into the
    stable-yard.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER XV</h2><br>


    <p>Lexington was in a wild state of excitement on the morning
    of the year's great race, the Ashland Oaks. In a private parlor
    of the Phoenix Hotel the two men who were, perhaps, most deeply
    interested of all in it, were weary of their speculations after
    they had gone, for the thousandth time, over every detail of
    possible prophecy and speculation. The Colonel sat beside a
    table upon which stood a "long" glass from which protruded, and
    in which nestled fragrant mint-leaves. At the bottom of the
    glass there lingered, yet, the good third of a julep.</p>

    <p>"There's one capital thing about a mint-julep," he said
    comfortably, and smacked appreciative lips. "One always
    suggests another." He drained his glass and rose. At the other
    side of the room was the bell-button. His finger was extended
    and about to touch it when he stopped to think. "No! Great
    heavens!" said he. "That makes my third, already, and I'm as
    dry as the desert of Sahara." He sat down again, an air of
    martyrdom upon his face. "Ah, well, Miss 'Lethe's worth it. I
    say, Frank, anything new in the extra?"</p>

    <p>The youthful owner of Queen Bess, to whom it seemed as if
    almost life itself were staked on the result of the coming
    contest at the track, lowered, with a nervous hand, for an
    instant only, the newspaper he had been poring over.</p>

    <p>"Only this," he said, and slowly read: "'Queen Bess is still
    the favorite for the Ashland Oaks. The report that she was
    injured in the fire by which her stable was burned, proves to
    be a canard. Her owner declares her to be unhurt and in fine
    condition.'"</p>

    <p>The Colonel nodded his approval. "That's what I've
    telegraphed the Dyer brothers. I'm sure they won't refuse to
    take her when they know the facts in the case. It was a close
    shave, though. If it hadn't been for that little thoroughbred
    from the mountains&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"When she rushed into the flames, last night, wasn't she
    magnificent!" said Frank, flushing with enthusiasm. "And when
    she came out, leading Queen Bess to safety, she looked like an
    angel!"</p>

    <p>The Colonel coughed in deprecation. "The simile's off, a
    little bit, ain't it? Angels are not supposed to come out of
    the flames."</p>

    <p>"At least, Colonel, you'll admit that she's the best and
    bravest little girl you ever knew."</p>

    <p>The Colonel smiled. "Yes; but, my boy, this enthusiasm is
    alarming." He laughed outright. "It seems to indicate another
    conflagration, with Cupid as the incendiary."</p>

    <p>The youth colored. "Oh, nonsense!"</p>

    <p>"Be more careful, Frank," his friend urged, becoming
    serious. "She's a dear, simple little thing, not used to the
    ways of the world. Don't let her get too fond of you."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"See here, my boy. I know you young fellows don't want an
    old fool, like me, interfering with your affairs, but I've
    taken that little girl right to my heart. I tell you, Frank,
    she's too brave and true to be trifled with. She's not that
    kind."</p>

    <p>Layson flushed hotly. The intimation, even from the Colonel,
    was more than he could bear with patience. "Stop!" he cried.
    "You've said enough. What you mean to insinuate is false!"</p>

    <p>The Colonel rose, embarrassed. The youth's earnestness
    astonished him. Could it be possible that this scion of an
    ancient bluegrass family, this leader of the younger set in one
    of the most exclusive circles in Kentucky, could really be
    thinking seriously of that untutored mountain-girl? "My boy,
    forgive me!" he exclaimed. "I&mdash;I didn't understand. I
    never dreamed there could be anything&mdash;er&mdash;serious. I
    thought, of course&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Frank paced the floor with nervous tread. Other things than
    the impending contest for the Ashland Oaks had been worrying
    him of late. Since he had left the mountains there had scarcely
    been a moment, waking or sleeping, when the face of the sweet
    mountain girl who had fascinated him among her rocks and
    forests, and had come down to the bluegrass to save not only
    his life but the life of his beloved mare, had not been vividly
    before him. Untutored she might be, uncouth of speech,
    unlearned in all those things, in fact, which the women he had
    known had ever held most valuable, but her compensating virtues
    had begun to take upon themselves their actual
    values&mdash;values so overwhelming in their magnitude that her
    few lackings grew to seem continually less important in his
    mind.</p>

    <p>"Never mind, Colonel," he said slowly, "you can't say
    anything to me but what I've said, over and over again, to
    myself. I know she's ignorant and uncultured. I know what it
    would mean if I should marry her. If I were to choose for a
    wife a fashionable girl, whose life is centered in the luxury
    which surrounds her, the world would smile approval; but for
    Madge, with her true, brave heart and noble thoughts, there
    would be only sneers and insults because she happened to be
    born up there in the mountains. That is the kind of people we
    are down here in the bluegrass." He smiled, somewhat bitterly.
    "And I&mdash;well, I'm too much like the rest to need any
    warning&mdash;too much of a coward to think of making her my
    wife."</p>

    <p>He sat, dejectedly, in a chair by the long table, and, with
    face held between his hands and elbows planted on the board,
    looked across it, through the open window, out into the
    thronging street with gloomy eyes. For days he had been
    fighting battle after battle with himself. He could not make
    his mind up as to what he ought to do. He knew he loved the
    mountain-girl, but&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

    <p>"There, there, my boy, I'm sorry," said the Colonel,
    sympathetically, apologetically. "Let's drop the subject. The
    ladies will be here, soon. Before they come I'll step over to
    the office and get the answer from the Dyer Brothers." He rose,
    looking at his watch. "It's nearly time it was here. They were
    to wire promptly. I'll bring it to you as soon as it comes." He
    went to Frank and put his hand upon his shoulder comfortingly.
    "Don't worry, my boy. It will all come out, all right. Ahem! I
    mean there's nothing the matter with the mare and the sale will
    go through."</p>

    <p>"I hope so," said Frank, rising without much show of energy.
    He was clearly on the edge of real discouragement. "If it
    doesn't&mdash;and that assessment to be met&mdash;ah, well!
    What's the use of worrying? It doesn't help the matter any." He
    walked slowly to the window and looked out. "Here come Madge
    and Aunt 'Lethe," he announced, "through with their shopping at
    last. How different Madge looks from the little mountain-girl I
    first knew!" He turned and faced the Colonel. "Ah, if the world
    knew her as I do&mdash;"</p>

    <p>The Colonel left the room, bound for the telegraph-office,
    just before a shrill scream came from the corridor, without,
    startling Layson greatly.</p>

    <p>"Oh, dellaw!" the frightened voice said. "Le' me out! Le' me
    out!"</p>

    <p>He recognized the voice, at once, as belonging to the girl
    whom he had been discussing with the Colonel, and it was so
    full of terror that he rushed quickly to the door, prepared to
    rescue her from some dire peril.</p>

    <p>"What can be the matter?" he thought, frightened.</p>

    <p>At the door he met Madge, white of face and startled, coming
    in.</p>

    <p>"Why, Madge! What is it?"</p>

    <p>She leaned against the writing-table, gasping. It was plain
    enough that she had been greatly frightened.</p>

    <p>"Wait till I git my breath," she said; and then: "They got
    us into a little room, and, all of a sudden, we started
    skallyhootin' fer th' roof&mdash;room an' all!"</p>

    <p>Frank fell back, relieved, and trying not to show
    amusement.</p>

    <p>"That was the elevator," he explained. "A machine to carry
    you upstairs and save you the work of climbing."</p>

    <p>"Dellaw!" exclaimed the girl, not yet entirely calm. "As if
    I couldn't walk! Thought we was blowed up by another dynamighty
    bomb!"</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea entered hurriedly, looking about the room, in
    evident distress. At sight of Madge she gave a great sigh of
    relief. "My dear, I'm so sorry you were frightened!"</p>

    <p>The girl laughed nervously, pulling herself together. "I
    understand, now, Miss 'Lethe, and I'm as cool as a
    cucumber."</p>

    <p>There was a group of darkies at the door, and, suddenly,
    they all began to grin. Miss 'Lethe knew the sign.</p>

    <p>"The Colonel's coming," she said positively. "Their faces
    show it. Look at them?"</p>

    <p>Her guess proved a true prophecy. The Colonel, plainly busy
    with absorbing thoughts, was striding along the uneven old
    brick sidewalk, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, when the crowd
    of darkies, sure of his good-nature, beneficiaries from past
    favors, many times, surrounded him, beseeching him for tips
    upon the coming races. Very different were these city darkies
    from the respectful negroes of the Kentucky plantations of the
    time. They swarmed about him in an insistent horde.</p>

    <p>"Who gwine win dat race, Marse Cunnel? Who gwine win dat
    race?" they chorussed.</p>

    <p>He stopped and beamed at them good-naturedly.</p>

    <p>"Who's going to win?" said he. "Queen Bess, of course."</p>

    <p>He joined the group, inside, with a bundle in one hand and
    an open telegram in the other. "Good morning, ladies. Miss
    'Lethe, you're looking fresh and blooming as you used to twenty
    years ago." He tried to catch himself, but failed. "As fresh
    and blooming," he corrected, "as usual, Miss 'Lethe." His bow
    was very courtly and her own no less so.</p>

    <p>"Frank, my boy," said he, turning to the youthful owner of
    Queen Bess, "I've got their answer, and it's all right."</p>

    <p>Frank had been acutely worried. There had been some question
    of the sale of the mare to the Dyer Brothers before the fire;
    now that this disaster had occurred and stories had been
    started, as, of course, he knew they must have been, about
    injuries to her, there might be, he had feared, good reason to
    expect the celebrated horsemen to withdraw their proposition.
    The Colonel's news, therefore, was very welcome.</p>

    <p>"They take the mare?" he asked, all eagerness."</p>

    <p>"N-o," began the Colonel, "but&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Frank's face fell, instantly, and his shoulders drooped
    despairingly. "Then it's all wrong."</p>

    <p>"Not yet," said the Colonel, "score again." He raised the
    telegram and read from it: "'Can't take mare without positive
    proof that she's all right. Let her run in the Ashland Oaks,
    to-day. If she wins, we take her.'" The Colonel looked up
    beamingly. "Do you hear? They take her!"</p>

    <p>The condition which, now, the Dyer brothers made, when,
    before this, they had made none, bothered Frank. The telegram
    did not elate him quite as much as the old horseman had
    supposed it would. "Ah, if she wins!" said he.</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea spoke up, eagerly. "Oh, Frank, of course she'll
    win."</p>

    <p>"She's <i>got</i> to win!" exclaimed the Colonel with much
    emphasis.</p>

    <p>Frank was in a pessimistic mood. "I'm not so sure," said he,
    a little gloomily. The strain of the past days had been a hard
    trial for the youth. "If that imp of a jockey, Ike, should get
    in range of a whiskey bottle&mdash;however, he has promised not
    to leave his room."</p>

    <p>The Colonel laughed. "Ike leave his room?" he said. "You're
    right&mdash;he won't; but it will not be his promise that will
    keep him from it. He couldn't leave it if he would."</p>

    <p>"Why not?" inquired Miss 'Lethe.</p>

    <p>"Because," the Colonel answered, "I have got his
    clothes!"</p>

    <p>"His clothes!" said Frank, astonished.</p>

    <p>"Yes&mdash;a Napoleonic device. When I went to see him, this
    morning, I found him in bed. I knew how it might be if he got
    out, so I saw to it that his meals would reach him promptly,
    and borrowed the one suit of clothes he brought with him, under
    pretence of needing them to help me order a new jockey-suit for
    him to wear in the great race. I've been fair about it,
    too&mdash;I've got the new clothes for him." He pointed to the
    bundle which he had just brought in. "They're in
    there&mdash;and they'll not disgrace Queen Bess. They're the
    best I could get."</p>

    <p>Frank, less interested in the clothes than in the fact that
    the jockey, now, was quite secure against temptation, sighed
    with satisfaction. "Then he's safe," said he.</p>

    <p>The Colonel nodded, notably well satisfied with his
    performance. Miss Alathea, shocked, as she tried to be, by all
    this business, adjunct of gambling, every bit of it, yet smiled
    admiringly at the big horseman. Only Madge, learned, through
    much experience with mountaineers, whose greatest curse is
    whisky, in the ways of men addicted to its use, was not
    convinced that all was surely well.</p>

    <p>"I'd keep a watch on him, just the same," she said. Now that
    she understood the vast importance of this race to Layson her
    whole heart was wrapped up in its fortunes. "When a man wants
    whisky he gener'ly finds a way to git it."</p>

    <p>"You're right, Madge," Frank agreed. "I think I'll go and
    look after him, now."</p>

    <p>He started toward the door just as a knock sounded on it.
    When he opened it he found Horace Holton standing waiting for
    admittance. The man seemed to be excited.</p>

    <p>"I don't want to intrude, sar," said the ex-merchant in
    slaves, "but I come to tell you what you'd orter know. Th' news
    of th' fire, last night, hev set ev'rybody wild. They're
    lookin' to you, sar, to sw'ar out a warrant for Joe Lorey an'
    set th' sheriff on his track."</p>

    <p>Frank came back into the room with the old man, worried by
    the news which he had brought. He had been thinking of this
    very matter and he was not at all convinced that he wished to
    swear a warrant out for Lorey. Finally, after a few seconds of
    silent and deep thought, he shook his head. "I want more proof,
    first," he declared.</p>

    <p>Holton was astonished and ill-pleased. "What more proof d'
    ye want?" he asked. "Ain't it as plain as day that he come down
    from th' mountings to get even with you for th' raidin' of his
    still? Who else would 'a' done it?"</p>

    <p>Madge was listening with flushed face and frowning brow. She
    did not, for a second, think Joe Lorey was the culprit. Her
    suspicions had not wholly crystalized, but she had known the
    mountain-boy since she had known anyone, and she could not
    believe that he would fire a building in which was confined a
    dumb and helpless creature. She knew him to be quite as fond of
    animals as she was. She believed Holton, also, had some
    ulterior reason, which she did not fathom, then, for trying to
    fasten suspicion on the lad. In her earnestness, as she
    considered these things, she stepped close to the old man,
    almost truculently. "That's what I mean to find out," she
    declared. "Who else done it."</p>

    <p>Holton was angered by her manner and her opposition. He had
    not expected to meet any difficulty in the execution of his
    plan to throw the blame of the outrageous crime at Woodlawn, on
    the shoulders of the mountaineer. "What have you got to do with
    it?" he angrily demanded.</p>

    <p>She was not impressed by his quick show of temper. "Reckon
    I've got as much to do with it as you hev," she replied. "Joe
    Lorey wouldn't never plan to burn a helpless dumb critter. He
    ain't no such coward."</p>

    <p>"Who else had a call to do it?" said the old man, placed,
    unexpectedly, on the defensive. "Who else war an enemy of Mr.
    Layson's?"</p>

    <p>Madge spoke slowly. She was not sure, at all, whom she was
    accusing; her suspicions were indefinite, obscure, but they
    were taking form within her mind. "Thar's one as I knows on,"
    she slowly answered. "It's th' one as told Joe Lorey that Mr.
    Frank had set th' revenuers onto him." Her conviction
    strengthened as she spoke, and, as she continued, she looked
    Holton firmly in the eye and spoke with emphasis. "Show me th'
    man as told that lie, an' I'll show you th' scoundrel as tried
    to burn Queen Bess!"</p>

    <p>Layson liked the spirit of her warm defense of her old
    friend, and, himself, knew enough about the moonshiner to make
    it seem quite reasonable. He knew that Joe was a crude
    creature, but believed, and had good reason to believe, that he
    had his code of honor which he would abide by at all cost. It
    was impossible for him to feel convinced that this would have
    permitted him to set fire to the stable. "Madge, I believe
    you're right," said he.</p>

    <p>Holton was nonplussed. Things were not going as he had
    expected and had wished them to, at all. "Oh, shore, it war Joe
    Lorey," he protested. "It couldn't 'a' been nobody else. I
    warns you, here an' now, Layson, that ef you don't set th' law
    after him he'll be lynched before to-morrer night."</p>

    <p>Layson was a little angered by the man's persistence. "I'll
    see that that doesn't happen," he replied, "and I'll leave no
    stone unturned to find the scoundrel who really did the deed,
    and have him punished. But I'm not certain that the man will
    prove to be Joe Lorey."</p>

    <p>Holton, angry, baffled and astonished, left the room, with a
    maddening conviction growing in his mind that things were going
    wrong and would continue to go wrong. He almost regretted, now,
    that he had yielded to the impulse to set fire to the stable.
    If Layson would not let him throw suspicion where he had
    intended it should fall, then one part of his plan would have
    failed utterly: he would not have put Joe Lorey, who, at
    liberty, must ever be a peril to him, from his path; and,
    furthermore, if they kept on with investigation, in the end
    they might&mdash;they might&mdash;but he would not let himself
    believe that, by any possibility, the real truth could come
    out. He assured himself as he stepped out into the crowded
    street that he was safe, whether or not the crime was ever
    fastened on Joe Lorey.</p>

    <p>Layson, after Holton left, looked around upon the party with
    a worried eye. "I can't take this matter up, yet," he declared.
    "Until the race is over I can think of nothing else. Colonel,
    I'll look after Ike, and then we'll be off to the track."</p>

    <p>"So we will, my boy," the Colonel answered, "so we will. Ah,
    what a race it will be!" As Frank went out, the horseman rubbed
    his hands with keen anticipations of delight.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Colonel," exclaimed Madge, brought back by this turn in
    the conversation to contemplation of the most exciting prospect
    which had ever been before her, "won't we have fun?"</p>

    <p>"Won't we?" said the Colonel, very happily.</p>

    <p>But then Miss Alathea spoke. She had listened to all the
    talk about the fire, the incendiary, the pursuit, and its
    dreadful possibilities of lynching, with the keenest of
    distress. Now the Colonel's calm declaration that, presently,
    they would be off to the race-track which he had sworn forever
    to taboo, shifted her mind suddenly from those unpleasant
    topics.</p>

    <p>"Colonel!" she exclaimed, in pained astonishment. "Do you
    forget your promise?"</p>

    <p>"Er&mdash;er&mdash;" the old horseman began and became
    speechless.</p>

    <p>Madge was all excitement. "Mr. Frank has told me all about
    it," she said gaily. "I kin see it, now&mdash;th' grand-stand
    filled with folks, th' jockeys ridin' in their bright colors,
    th' horses a-champin' an' a-pullin' at their bits&mdash;an'
    then&mdash;th' start!" The girl had dreamed about such scenes
    before she had so much as guessed that she might ever witness
    one, and now, when she was actually about to go out to the
    track, herself, and with her own eyes gaze upon the greatest
    race which old Kentucky had known for many a year, it seemed
    too good to be true. Her eyes sparkled as she spoke, her feet
    danced as if they might be in the stirrups, her hands clutched
    on imaginary reins. "All off together, a-goin' like th'
    lightnin'!" she exclaimed. "Queen Bess a-lyin' back an' lettin'
    th' others do th' runnin', Ike never touchin' her with whip nor
    spur until th' last, an' then jest liftin' her in as if she had
    wings!"</p>

    <p>"Stop! Stop!" cried the Colonel. "Not another word, or I'll
    drop dead in my tracks!" Then, cautiously, to Madge: "I say,
    little one, couldn't you let me have a word alone with Miss
    'Lethe?"</p>

    <p>The girl nodded wisely. "I understand," said she; and then,
    with a quick glance at Miss Alathea, who was not attending, and
    an earnest and imploring look at the poor Colonel: "Whatever
    you do don't you forget that we are goin' to th' races!" She
    left the room.</p>

    <p>Forget! The Colonel was not likely to forget about those
    races! He was in deep misery of mind. "Miss 'Lethe?" he said
    timidly.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Colonel," said the charming lady, turning toward
    him.</p>

    <p>"Miss 'Lethe, have you the remotest idea of the agony I'm
    suffering?"</p>

    <p>"Why, Colonel, what's the matter? Aren't you well?" Miss
    'Lethe's keen anxiety was instantaneous.</p>

    <p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I'm well&mdash;that is, I am now, but I
    shouldn't wonder if I'd be dead before night. Miss 'Lethe, when
    we made our little arrangement, yesterday, I didn't know that
    the sale of the mare, your twenty-five thousand dollars, the
    assessment on Frank's stock, everything was going to depend
    upon this race. I tell you, if I don't see it, I'm liable to an
    attack of heart-disease."</p>

    <p>"Ah, Colonel," said she, sadly, "I see where your heart
    really is!"</p>

    <p>"With you, Miss 'Lethe, always with you," he urgently
    assured her; but there was pleading in his eyes which really
    was pitiful.</p>

    <p>"Remember your solemn promise."</p>

    <p>"But one little race," he begged. "That wouldn't count,
    would it? And then swear off forever."</p>

    <p>"No, Colonel; no," she firmly answered, "for if you yield,
    this time, I'll know that in the race for your affections the
    horse is first, the woman second."</p>

    <p>The Colonel sank dejectedly into a chair. "I can't permit
    you to think that," said he. "I'll&mdash;keep my promise."</p>

    <p>She went to him, delighted. "Ah, I was sure you would," said
    she. "Now I can go and finish my shopping in peace. It's all
    for your good, Colonel&mdash;for your good." With a happy smile
    she left him there, alone.</p>

    <p>"For my good!" exclaimed the Colonel, ruefully. "That's what
    the teacher used to say, but the hickory smarted, just the
    same. Of course Miss 'Lethe is
    first&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;the horse is a strong
    second!"</p>

    <p>To add to the man's agony, Madge, now, returned, dressed and
    ready for the most exciting moments of her life. "I'm all
    ready, Colonel," she said eagerly. "Think we'll have good
    seats? I do hope I'll be whar I kin see!"</p>

    <p>He would not, yet, disappoint the child; he would not,
    yet,&mdash;he could not&mdash;admit that he, himself, was to
    meet with such a bitter disappointment. "You'll see, all
    right," he told her, "and so will I." But, after a second's
    thought he added: "I will if I can hire a balloon!"</p>

    <p>They heard Neb's excited voice out in the corridor, and, an
    instant later, the old darkey hurried in. Immediately the
    Colonel knew, from his appearance, that something had gone
    seriously wrong.</p>

    <p>"What is it, Neb; what is it?" he demanded.</p>

    <p>"Fo' de Lawd, sech news!" said Neb. "Sech news!"</p>

    <p>"Neb, Neb, what's the matter?" Madge asked, frightened by
    his manner.</p>

    <p>"Somebody," said the negro, "done gone smuggle in a bottle
    o' whiskey to dat mis'able jockey, Ike, an' he am crazy
    drunk!"</p><br>

    <center><hr style="width: 65%;"></center>
    <br>
    <a name="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2><br>


    <p>"Drunk!" cried the Colonel, shocked inexpressibly. "And the
    race this afternoon!"</p>

    <p>"Marse Frank said you was to come, suh, an' help sobuh
    him."</p>

    <p>Madge approached the Colonel anxiously. "Yes; sober him, if
    you have to turn him inside out!"</p>

    <p>"'Fraid he's done on bofe sides, missy; drunk cl'ar
    t'rough," said Neb.</p>

    <p>The Colonel grasped his hat. "We'll try, we'll try," he
    said. "Oh, whisky, whisky! What a pity anyone can get too much
    of so good a thing!"</p>

    <p>"I neber could, suh," Neb replied, "but dat 'ar
    jockey&mdash;"</p>

    <p>They hurried out together.</p>

    <p>Madge was in intense distress. She knew what this might
    mean. If Queen Bess could not run&mdash;and she could not,
    certainly, without a jockey&mdash;the Dyer Brothers would not
    buy her, probably; and if she were not sold in time, then
    Layson would be quite unable to meet the assessment on his
    stock in the coal-mining company. She was by no means certain
    what this was, or what the reason for it, but she had heard
    talk of it and knew that it was very serious. Almost beside
    herself with her anxiety, she could do nothing save sit there
    and wait for news. The entrance, even of Barbara Holton, who
    came in, now, was a relief to her overtaxed nerves.</p>

    <p>"Say," said she, admitting Barbara nearer to good-fellowship
    than she had ever done before, "I reckon you have heered the
    news&mdash;Ike's drunk&mdash;dead drunk!"</p>

    <p>Barbara regarded her excitement with a careful calm. She,
    herself, had been excited by the news when it had reached her,
    but a moment since, but she would not let this girl know that.
    Her r&ocirc;le was to endeavor to force the mountain girl back
    into what she thought her place, at any cost.</p>

    <p>"Yes, I've heard," said she, "and it's too late to get
    another jockey, so Queen Bess can't run."</p>

    <p>She had formed a plan, deep in her mind, and had sought the
    mountain-girl with the skilful scheme.</p>

    <p>"Then Mr. Frank is goin' to be ruined!" Madge exclaimed,
    dejectedly.</p>

    <p>"Not unless you wish it," Barbara replied, looking straight
    into her eyes.</p>

    <p>"Dellaw! Me wish that? Just you tell me what you mean!"</p>

    <p>The bluegrass girl stood looking at the mountain maiden with
    appraising eye for a few seconds. Then she crossed the room and
    stood close by her side, while she tapped upon the table
    nervously with her carefully gloved fingers.</p>

    <p>"If this sale fails, as it seems it must," she said, slowly,
    "it rests with you whether my father will advance the money to
    pay the assessment on that stock of Mr. Layson's."</p>

    <p>"Your father give him the money?" Madge said in
    astonishment. "Well, I'd never thought o' that! But what have I
    got to do about it?"</p>

    <p>The situation was a hard one, even for the self-possession
    of the lowlands girl, who had inherited her father's coolness
    in emergency as well as some other traits less desirable. Her
    color rose and she tried, earnestly, to gather words which
    would express the thought she had in mind without including a
    confession of the weakness of her own position. This she could
    not, do, however. She walked over to the window, gazed from it,
    for a moment, at the passing crowds, and then returned to
    Madge, to tell her bluntly: "I want you to go away from
    here."</p>

    <p>"Me go away? What for?"</p>

    <p>It was impossible, Barbara now discovered, to make her
    meaning wholly clear, without some measure of humiliation. The
    first thing that was, obviously, necessary was a statement of
    facts as they were, and this must include confession of her own
    sore weakness. She hesitated, trying to avoid it, but when she
    quite decided that it could not be helped, plunged on with a
    perfect frankness. What she wished was immediately to gain her
    point. If she must eat a bit of humble pie in order to
    accomplish this, why, she would eat it, much as she disliked
    the diet.</p>

    <p>"Can't you see that it is you who stand between Frank and
    me?" she cried. "If it hadn't been for you, I should have been
    his promised wife! If you will go away and never see him again,
    I can win him back."</p>

    <p>Madge was dumbfounded. The cold and utter selfishness of the
    girl's proposal was astounding. She looked at Barbara with eyes
    in which incredulous amazement gave way, slowly, to an
    expression of chill wonder. "Say, you don't seem to squander
    many thoughts on other people! S'posin' I happen to love him a
    little, myself!"</p>

    <p>Barbara laughed scornfully. Sprung from low stock, herself,
    but reared in luxury, she had the most complete contempt for
    anyone whom circumstances had denied advantages such as she had
    known. "You&mdash;<i>you</i> love him!" she exclaimed.</p>

    <p>The words had slipped from Madge's lips without forethought,
    and, instantly, she very much regretted them; but, now that she
    had uttered them she did not so much as think of trying to
    recall them or deny their truth. "Yes, and I ain't ashamed of
    it," said she. "I <i>do</i> love him&mdash;a thousand times
    better nor you ever dreamed of."</p>

    <p>"What good will it do you?" asked her rival, coldly. "You
    don't suppose he'll ever think of making you his wife! Why,
    look at the difference between you and me!"</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Madge, sarcastically, "there <i>is</i> a
    powerful sight of differ! You'd be willin' to ruin' him to win
    him, while I'd be willin' to gin up my happiness to save
    him!"</p>

    <p>Barbara, more in earnest than she ever had been in her life
    before, took a quick step toward the mountain girl. "Then prove
    it by going away," said she, "and I will see that my father
    advances Frank Layson the money he needs." She looked at her
    eagerly. "Do you promise?"</p>

    <p>"No," said Madge, with firm decision. "No; I won't."</p>

    <p>"Then it is you who will ruin him."</p>

    <p>While they had been talking an idea had sprung to sudden
    flower in Madge's mind. It was a daring, an unheard of plan
    that had occurred to her. There were details of it which filled
    her with shrinking. She knew that if she put it into practice,
    and it ever became generally known, she would be the talk of
    Lexington and that not all that talk would be complimentary.
    She knew that, after she had carried out the plan, even the man
    for whom she thought of doing it might look at her with scorn.
    But it was the only plan which her alert and anxious brain
    could find which promised anything at all. And if it won,
    perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;he might not scorn her! At any rate
    it was a sacrifice, and sacrifice for him was an attractive
    thought to her.</p>

    <p>"Me ruin him?" she said to Barbara. "Don't you be too sure!
    There is a shorter and a better way nor yours, to save him, an'
    I'm goin' to try it!"</p>

    <p>The bluegrass girl, astonished, would have questioned her,
    but Madge waited for no questioning. Without another word she
    hurried from the room, in a mad search for Colonel
    Doolittle.</p>

    <p>From the country round about for miles the planters had come
    into Lexington upon their blooded mounts, their wives,
    daughters, sweethearts, riding in great carriages. Now and then
    a vehicle, coming from some far-away plantation, was drawn by a
    gay four-in-hand, and the drivers of such equipages, negroes
    always, showed a haughty scorn of their black fellow-men who
    travelled humbly on the backs of mules, or trudged the long and
    dusty way on foot. Gorgeous were the costumes of the ladies
    whom the carriages conveyed; elegant the dress of the gay
    gentlemen who rode beside the vehicles on prancing steeds,
    gallant escorts of Kentucky's lovely womanhood, prepared,
    especially, to watch the carriage-horses when the town was
    reached and guard against disasters due to their encounter with
    such disturbing and unusual things as crowds, brass-bands and
    other marvels of a great occasion.</p>

    <p>Everywhere upon the sidewalks people swarmed like ants,
    delighted with the calm perfection of the day, the magnetism of
    the crowds, the blare of martial music, the novelty of passing
    strangers, and, above all, by the prospect of the great race
    which, for weeks, had been the theme of conversation everywhere
    throughout the section.</p>

    <p>In the spacious corridors and big bar-rooms of the city's
    hostelries the rich men of the section vied with flashily
    dressed strangers, in magnitude of wagers, and the gambling
    fever spread from these important centers to the very alleys of
    the negro quarters. Poor indeed was the old darkey who could
    not find two-bits to wager on the race; small, indeed, the
    piccaninny who was not wise enough in the sophisticated ways of
    games of chance to lay a copper with a comrade or to join a
    pool by means of which he and his fellows were enabled to
    participate in more important methods of wooing fickle
    Fortune.</p>

    <p>Here and there and everywhere were the piccaninnies from
    Woodlawn, the Layson place, crying the virtues of the mare they
    worshipped and her owner whom they each and everyone adored,
    boasting of the wagers they had made, strutting in the
    consciousness that ere the moment for the great race came "Unc"
    Neb would gather them together to add zest to the occasion with
    their brazen instruments and singing. The "Whangdoodles" were
    the envy of every colored lad in town who was not of their high
    elect, and created, about noon, a great diversion upon one of
    the main streets, by gathering, when they were quite certain
    that their leader could by no means get at them, and singing on
    a corner for more coppers to be wagered on Queen Bess. The
    shower of coin which soon rewarded their smooth, well-trained
    harmonies, burned holes in their pockets, too, until it was
    invested in the only things which, on this day, the lads
    thought worth the purchasing&mdash;tickets on the race in which
    the wondrous mare would run.</p>

    <p>Through the gay crowd old Neb was wandering, disconsolate,
    burdened with the melancholy news of the defection of the
    miserable jockey, looking, everywhere, for Miss Alathea Layson,
    but without success. He stopped upon a corner, weary of the
    search and of the woe which weighed him down.</p>

    <p>"Marse Frank," he muttered, "say I war to tell Miss 'Lethe
    de bad news; but he didn't tell me how to find a lady out
    shoppin'. Needle in a haystack ain't nawthin'! Reckon 'bout de
    bes' dat I kin do is stand heah on dis cohnuh an' cotch huh
    when she comes back to de hotel."</p>

    <p>He stood there for fully fifteen minutes, peering in an
    utter desolation of woe, at every passing face, but finding
    nowhere that one which he sought. Then, at a distance, he saw
    the Colonel coming. The expression on the horseman's face
    amazed him and filled him with an instant hope that something
    had turned up to rob the situation of the horror which had
    darkened it, for him, ever since he had discovered that the
    jockey had disgraced himself.</p>

    <p>"Dar come Marse Cunnel," he exclaimed, in his astonishment,
    "<i>a-lookin' mighty happy</i>! Dat ain't right, now; dat ain't
    right, unduh de succumstances."</p>

    <p>He hurried to the Colonel, who, instead of seeming
    sorrowful, discouraged, wroth, beamed at him with a genial
    eye.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter, Neb?" he asked. "You look like a
    funeral!"</p>

    <p>"Dat's de way I feel, suh; wid no jockey fo' Queen Bess an'
    Marse Frank good as ruined."</p>

    <p>"Neb," said the Colonel, coolly, "you don't mean to be a
    liar, but you are one."</p>

    <p>"What?" cried the darkey in delight. "Oh Marse Cunnel, call
    me anyt'ing ef tain't so about de mare!"</p>

    <p>"Of course it isn't," said the Colonel happily. "I have
    found a jockey, Neb; a jockey."</p>

    <p>"Praise de Lawd!" cried the old negro.</p>

    <p>"One of the best," the Colonel went on, gaily. "Just come in
    from the&mdash;from the east. I engaged him at once, so you get
    word to Frank. In five minutes we'll be on our way out to the
    track."</p>

    <p>Neb's spirits had instantly revived. Six inches droop was
    gone from his old shoulders. "It'll be de grandest race eber
    run in ol' Kentucky! Lawsy, Cunnel, won't it tickle you to
    death to see Queen Bess romp in a winnuh?"</p>

    <p>Instantly the Colonel's high elation faded. More than the
    droop which had been in Neb's shoulders now oppressed the
    horseman's. His face clouded. "There <i>he</i> goes, too!" he
    cried. "Neb, another word like that and I shall brain you! Do
    you hear me? I&mdash;I shan't be there!"</p>

    <p>"Not be dar!" Neb exclaimed. "Kain't swaller dat, suh. Ef
    you should miss dat race, why, you'd drop daid."</p>

    <p>"I believe you, Neb&mdash;believe you. I say, Neb, look
    here. I have promised on the honor of a Kentuckian, never to
    enter another race-track. I must keep my word; but, for the
    Lord's sake, isn't there a knot-hole, that you know of,
    somewhere in the fence, which would let me see the race without
    going inside?"</p>

    <p>Neb knew that race-track as he knew the plot of hard-trodden
    ground before the little cabin where he had been born back of
    the big house out at Woodlawn. Many a race had he seen
    surreptitiously when he had not funds to buy admission to the
    track. He grinned, remembering talk which he had heard between
    the Colonel and Miss 'Lethe, and understanding, now. He
    laughed. "Oh, I yi!" he cried. "Marse Cunnel, dar ain't
    nobody'll git ahead of you! You bet dar is a knot-hole, not fur
    off frum de gran'-stan', neither, an' a tree, too, you could
    climb, stan's mighty handy."</p>

    <p>The Colonel groaned. "I climb a tree to peek above a
    race-track fence!" said he. "No; never. They'd think I was
    trying to save my admission fee! The knot-hole will have to do
    for me, Neb. You've saved me. Heaven bless you! Have a
    cigar&mdash;they're good."</p>

    <p>"T'ankee, suh," said Neb, reaching for the weed the Colonel
    now held toward him. "Lawsy, ain't dat jus' a whoppuh? Whah
    you-all git sech mon'sous big cigahs as dat?"</p>

    <p>"I'm only smoking half as many, now, so I get 'em double
    size," the Colonel answered, sighing but not wholly
    miserable.</p>

    <p>Neb did not see the humor of this detail. He was thinking of
    the race and of Queen Bess. "Hooray fo' de Cunnel!" he
    exclaimed, irrelevantly, to a little group of colored men who
    had been gathering. "Whatever he says yo' kin gamble on. Lawsy,
    ain't I glad I's got my money on Queen Bess? Golly, won't Marse
    Holton jes' feel cheap when he done heahs dis news? Seen him
    down dar in de pool-room, not so long ago, a-puttin' up his
    money plumb against Queen Bess. Goin' to lose it, suah, he
    will." He went off, muttering, and shaking his old head.
    "Somehow I jes' feels it in mah bones dat he ain't true to
    Marse Frank, yessuh. If I evah fin's it out fo' suah, I'll jes'
    <i>paralyse</i> him!"</p>

    <p>He had quite forgotten that he had come out to find Miss
    Alathea, and was not looking for her when he actually stumbled
    into her.</p>

    <p>"Why, Neb, what are you doing?" she said, recoiling.</p>

    <p>"Pahdon, pahdon, please, Miss 'Lethe," said the negro. "I
    was thinkin' of de sweet bimeby an' waitin' fo' to tell de news
    to you&mdash;fust dat Ike got drunk an' Marse Frank war gwine
    hab to scratch de mare&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Then Frank&mdash;why, he'll lose
    everything!"</p>

    <p>"Hol' on, Miss 'Lethe; dat de fust half, only. Secon' half
    am dat Marse Cunnel found a jockey an' Queen Bess am gwine ter
    run."</p>

    <p>"Bless his heart!" she cried. "I wonder if it's wrong for me
    to pray that that jockey will win." She looked, almost
    embarrassed at the aged negro for a moment, and then, mustering
    up courage, said: "Neb, look here. I'm ashamed to acknowledge
    so much interest in a horse-race, but it seems as if I can't
    wait to hear of the result."</p>

    <p>"Lawsy, I don't blame you, none; feel dat way mahse'f."</p>

    <p>"I must know the result the instant the race is
    decided."</p>

    <p>"Send yo' wuhd right off, Miss 'Lethe."</p>

    <p>"Oh, I can't wait for that. Neb, I never did such a thing
    before and never will again, and, even now, I won't enter a
    race-track; but, Neb, isn't there some place outside the fence
    where I could watch the race without actually going in?"</p>

    <p>Neb doubled up in silent laughter. The old negro was
    enjoying life, exceedingly, on this, the day, which, for a
    time, had seemed so full of gloom. The white folks were quite
    at his mercy. "You bet dar is," said he, "a knot-hole not fur
    f'm de gran'-stan', an' a tree what you could climb, right
    handy."</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea was not favorable to the thought of climbing
    trees, and said so. "No, no; the knot-hole will be far better
    for me."</p>

    <p>"But, Miss 'Lethe, why, de Cunnel&mdash;"</p>

    <p>She did not let him make his explanation. "Sh! Sh!" she
    hissed. "Not a word of this to him, or anyone! Will you show
    me, when the time comes?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, I'll show you," Neb replied, and before he had a chance
    to add a word she had hurried off into the crowd.</p>

    <p>"I war gwine to tell her dat de Cunnel'd be dar, too, but
    she wouldn't wait to heah. Wal, I reckon she'll jes' fin' 'im
    when she git dar."</p>

    <p>Down the street his piccaninny band came straggling, looking
    for him.</p>

    <p>"Hol' on, chillun; hol' on," he cried, and joined them. "Now
    yo' lissen. Yo' is not to make a squawk until the end of de
    Ashlan' Oaks. Yo's to sabe yo' bref to honuh ouah Queen Bess.
    If she wins, yo' staht in playin' 'Dixie' as yo' nevuh played
    afo'. If she loses yo's to play, real slow an' mo'nful,
    'Massa's in de Col', Col', Groun'.'"</p>

    <p>In the meantime the Colonel, in a quiet spot, had joined the
    jockey who had been discovered to take the place of drunken
    Ike. The unknown rider was wrapped closely in an ulster, from
    beneath which riding boots, unusually small, peeped, now and
    then, as the feet within them moved somewhat nervously
    about.</p>

    <p>"All right, are you?" he inquired.</p>

    <p>"I ain't afeared," the jockey answered, "but I'm powerful
    nervous. Never had on clo'es like these before, an'&mdash;don't
    you look at me!"</p>

    <p>Strange talk, this was, for the jockey who was soon to ride
    Queen Bess for the capture of the Ashland Oaks and the
    salvation of the fortune of the house of Layson!</p>

    <p>"Don't look at you!" said the Colonel, in expostulation,
    and, in the next sentence, revealed a secret which he was
    guarding carefully from everyone. "See here, little girl,
    you've got to face thousands and not wince, and you can't ride
    in that overcoat, either."</p>

    <p>But the jockey wrapped the coat still tighter. "Oh, sho!
    That can't make no differ&mdash;just a little coat!"</p>

    <p>"I tell you it's impossible. It would give the game away at
    once. Come, take it off. Practice up on me."</p>

    <p>The jockey shivered nervously. "Reckon I will hev to. Say,
    turn your back till I am ready."</p>

    <p>The Colonel turned his back, somewhat impatiently. The time
    was getting short. "All right, but hurry up."</p>

    <p>The jockey pulled the long coat partly off, then, in a
    panic, shrugged it on again. "Oh, now, you're lookin'!"</p>

    <p>"Not a wink," declared the Colonel.</p>

    <p>"Wal, here goes!" This time the coat came wholly off and the
    jockey who had been discovered to take the place of drunken Ike
    stood quite revealed. The voice which warned the Colonel of
    this was a faint and faltering one. "Now," it said timidly.</p>

    <p>The Colonel turned. "Hurrah!"</p>

    <p>The jockey held the coat up in a panic.</p>

    <p>"See here, now&mdash;none o' that!" the Colonel warned.
    "Give it to me." He reached his hand out for the coat, and,
    reluctantly, the jockey let him take it.</p>

    <p>There stood the trimmest and most graceful figure ever
    garbed in racing blouse, knickers, boots and cap, with flushed
    face, dilating, frightened eyes and hands not a little
    tremulous. The girl who had told Barbara Holton that she would
    not hesitate to make a sacrifice to save the man she loved was
    making one&mdash;a very great one&mdash;the sacrifice of what,
    her whole life long, she had considered fitting woman's
    modesty. Queen Bess must win and there was no one else to ride
    her. The mountain-girl shrank from the thought of going, thus,
    before a multitude, as shyly as would the most highly educated
    and most socially precise girl in the grand-stand, near, which,
    now, was filling with the gallantry and beauty of Kentucky; but
    she did not let her nervous tremors conquer her. There was no
    other way to save the day for Layson, and, somehow, the day
    must certainly be saved.</p>

    <p>The Colonel, now, spoke very seriously as she stood there,
    shrinking from his gaze. There was not a smile upon his face.
    It was plain that he regarded the whole matter with the utmost
    gravity.</p>

    <p>"Now, little one, you begin to realize what this means,"
    said he. "Or&mdash;no, you don't and I've got to be square with
    you if it spoils the prettiest horse-race ever seen in old
    Kentucky. I tell you, my dear child, we're mighty particular
    about our women, down here in the bluegrass. We'd think it an
    eternal shame and a disgrace forever for one of them to ride a
    public race in a costume like the one that you have on, and it
    would mean not less than social ruin to the man that married
    her. If anyone should find it out, what you are going to do
    might stand between you and your happiness. I'm warning you
    because I know I ought to. Think it over and then tell me if
    you're willing to face it&mdash;willing to take all the
    risks."</p>

    <p>"I don't need to think it over," Madge said firmly. "I said
    as I'd gin up my happiness to save him, an' I will. Colonel,
    I've got on my uniform, I've enlisted for th' war, an' I am
    goin' to fight it through!"</p>

    <p>"A thoroughbred!" he cried. "A thoroughbred, and I always
    said it of you. Come on, little one."</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2><br>


    <p>Brilliant as a garden of flowers was the grand-stand where
    the fairest of old Kentucky's wondrous women were as numerous
    as were her gallant men; full of handsome figures were the
    lawns, where old Kentucky's youth and manhood strolled and
    smoked and gossipped of the day's great race to come; like an
    ebon sea in storm was the great crowd of blacks which in
    certain well-defined limits crowded to the rail about the
    track. The blare of the band kept the air a-tremble almost
    constantly, the confused, uneven murmur of a great crowd filled
    the pauses between brazen outbursts. Everywhere was life and
    gayety, intense excitement, as the moment for the starting of
    the famous Ashland Oaks approached. The cries of the
    book-makers rose, strident, from the betting-ring; on the
    tracks the jockeys, exercising or trying out their mounts,
    were, each after his own kind, preparing for the struggle of
    their lives; stable-boys, and the hundred other species of
    race-track hangers-on which swarm at such times to the front,
    were everywhere in evidence; touts with shifty eyes slipped,
    here and there, among the sightseers, looking for some
    credulous one who might be willing to pay well for doubtful
    information. Every minute amidst the throng the words "Queen
    Bess" might be heard at any chosen point, as the crowd
    gossipped eagerly about the horse which had been looked on as
    the favorite, but which, many positively now declared, had been
    so injured in the fire that she would run but poorly in the
    race which, it had been thought, would be the most sensational
    effort of her life.</p>

    <p>Frank, nervous and excited, stood in the paddock, watch in
    hand, with old Neb by his side.</p>

    <p>"Why doesn't that jockey come?" he asked, for the hundredth
    time, almost beside himself with worry as the moments slipped
    away.</p>

    <p>"He'll come, Marse Frank," said Neb. "You kin gamble on de
    Cunnel."</p>

    <p>"If I only knew what kind of a jockey he is!" Then, as
    Horace Holton came up, smiling greetings: "Holton, how's the
    betting?"</p>

    <p>"Can't you hear?" said Holton, as a vagrant breeze brought
    to their ears bits of the vocal tumult from the
    betting-ring.</p>

    <p>"Ten to nine against Queen Bess," Frank heard a voice call
    loudly, although the crowd's great murmur made the words come
    indistinctly to his ears. "Even on Catalpa," was the next
    penetrating cry, and then: "Two to one, Evangeline!"</p>

    <p>The young owner shuddered. Could it be possible that Neb was
    right and that the Colonel's jockey would appear on time, or
    were the dire predictions of defeat which, he knew, were being
    made everywhere around him, true prophecies? Tales of all but
    fatal injuries to the handsome mare had been freely circulated,
    and, despite denials in the newspapers, were still alive, and
    these he knew to be quite false; but he knew of the other dire
    disaster&mdash;the defection of his jockey&mdash;of which the
    crowd was also well aware. He had not the slightest doubt that
    if Queen Bess should run at all she would do all that her best
    friends expected of her and more; but it seemed to him a
    possibility that he would find it necessary, at the last
    minute, to withdraw her from the race entirely, for sheer lack
    of a rider.</p>

    <p>Again the breeze brought from the betting-ring the loud
    shouts of the book-makers. The message that they told was most
    depressing to the worried owner.</p>

    <p>"Why, this morning she was the favorite," he said, "and now
    the odds are all against her!"</p>

    <p>Holton nodded. "On the strength o' this jockey as nobody
    knows. Got any money on, yourself, Layson?"</p>

    <p>"Not a cent. I've enough at stake, already."</p>

    <p>Holton smiled unpleasantly, intimating that Frank's lack of
    betting on his horse was proof positive that the worst tales
    told were true. "That settles it. The bookies are right. Th'
    mare's no chance with a new jockey, an' you know it."</p>

    <p>"If I were betting," said Frank angrily, "I'd back her with
    every dollar that I have on earth."</p>

    <p>Holton smiled at him unpleasantly. "I say she can't win and
    you know it." He waited for some answer from the anxious owner,
    but received none. Then, taking out his check-book: "See
    here&mdash;I'll bet you five-thousand even against her!"</p>

    <p>Frank, annoyed but helpless, shook his head. "I haven't the
    money," he admitted.</p>

    <p>"You ain't got the sand!" said Holton, aggravatingly.</p>

    <p>Frank turned from him angrily, and old Neb, who had
    listened, stepped quickly up to him. "Marse Frank," he pleaded,
    "don' yo' let dat white-trash bluff yo'!" The old darkey's
    voice was tremulous, his eyes were moist with feeling for his
    humiliated master. A great resolve thrilled through him. "See
    heah, honey, I's be'n sabin' all mah life. I's got a pile o'
    money in de bank. Take it all, now, honey, an' bet it on Queen
    Bess."</p>

    <p>Frank shook his head, but smiled at the old darkey, touched
    alike by his devotion to himself and confidence in the mare
    they both loved. "No, no, Neb; not your money," he replied. He
    stood in deep thought, for a moment, tapping the ground
    nervously with worried foot. "But I'll back the mare for all
    <i>I'm</i> worth!" he finally declared. "If she loses, I'm a
    ruined man, anyway." He turned, now, to Holton. "Holton," he
    said, "I've got just three thousand dollars in the bank. I'll
    put it all on Queen Bess against your five-thousand."</p>

    <p>It seemed, almost, as if Holton had been waiting for this
    offer, for his smile broadened as he found that he had goaded
    Layson into making it. "I'll take it," he said quickly, and
    then, turning to the crowd about them, among which were some of
    the state's best citizens, he added: "Gentlemen, you're
    witnesses. Three-thousand against five-thousand on Queen
    Bess."</p>

    <p>They nodded, and not one of them but looked at Layson with
    commiseration, as at a man foredoomed to bitter
    disappointment.</p>

    <p>Neb, however, grinned at Holton impishly. "Yes; you'll look
    mighty sick when yo' hab to pay it, too."</p>

    <p>From the judge's stand rang out the silvery notes of a
    quavering bugle-call, and Holton smiled unpleasantly.</p>

    <p>"The call to th' post," said he, "an' whar's your
    jockey?"</p>

    <p>"He'll be here on time," said Frank, voicing a confidence
    which it was hard for him to feel. He turned, then, to the
    darkey. "Neb, bring out Queen Bess."</p>

    <p>The excitement, all around them, was intensifying, every
    minute. Jockeys, now, were mounting their horses, and riding
    off for the short canter to the judges' stand. As each appeared
    in view of the great crowd in and about the grand-stand a
    mighty shout arose.</p>

    <p>Holton's smile was broadening. "If that jockey doesn't show
    up mighty quick," he sneered, "you're out of the race."</p>

    <p>Just as he spoke old Neb returned, with the superb mare
    behind him, saddled, bridled, ready for the race, fretting at
    her bit, impatient of the crowds and noise.</p>

    <p>"Who knows whether he's coming, at all?" said Holton, a bit
    dashed at sight of the fine mare's superb condition, but still
    sneering. "Nobody's seen him."</p>

    <p>Neb looked off toward the weighing-room. "Yo' 're wrong," he
    shouted, capering with amazing spryness for one whose limbs
    were old and stiff, "fo' heah he comes!"</p>

    <p>Every member of the party turned, in haste, to look in the
    direction whence Neb pointed.</p>

    <p>They saw a slight, graceful figure, dressed in the brilliant
    colors of the Layson stable, which, without so much as glancing
    at them, ran to Queen Bess and took a place upon the far side
    of the mare, where, stooping as if to look carefully to the
    saddle-girths, its face was quickly hidden. But, even as the
    jockey stooped, one of his hands held out to Frank, across the
    saddle, a little folded paper.</p>

    <p>Without paying much attention to the jockey, Layson took
    this note and hastily unfolded it. "It's from the Colonel," he
    announced. "I knew he'd never fail me."</p>

    <p>Then he read, aloud, so all might hear:</p>

    <p>"This will be handed to you by a jockey I have just engaged.
    He comes from the east and is highly recommended. I know his
    endorser. Regretting that the promise of a Kentuckian prevents
    me from being with you, I am yours regretfully, on the outside,
    SANDUSKY DOOLITTLE."</p>

    <p>"It's all right!" Frank shouted, gleefully, and then, to the
    strange jockey: "Quick, on the mare and off to the post!"</p>

    <p>Without a word, without a second's pause, Madge, for the
    unknown jockey was, of course, the little mountain girl, jumped
    upon Queen Bess and hastily rode off, to be greeted, with a
    mighty outburst of cheering and applause as the favorite
    appeared before the waiting crowds in unmistakably fine
    condition and mounted by a rider whose every movement showed a
    perfect knowledge of the work and complete sympathy with the
    beautiful animal he rode.</p>
    <center><hr style="width: 45%;"></center>

    <p>Doomed by his promise on the honor of a gentleman to Miss
    Alathea, to witnessing the race from the outside, if he
    witnessed it at all, Colonel Sandusky Doolittle, fully aware of
    the unusual interest of the moments, some account of which has
    just been made, was sunk in melancholy after he had sent Madge
    through the magic portals, with explicit instructions as to
    exactly what to do when once she was safe inside. He was
    breathing hard from the mere exertion of preventing his unruly
    feet from running to the gate, of keeping his unruly hand from
    diving deep into his pocket for the entrance fee. These
    preventions he accomplished, though, without once really
    weakening, and was safe at a good distance from the tempting
    gate when the crowd within began to shout as the horses were
    brought out.</p>

    <p>"There, they're bringing out the horses!" he exclaimed,
    unhappily. He set his jaws as might one who, with a great
    effort, abstains from food when famishing. "I didn't go in!" he
    muttered. "I've kept my word, though it has nearly finished
    me!"</p>

    <p>Anxiously, if hurriedly, he searched along the fence for the
    knot-hole Neb had told him of. Twice, in his great eagerness,
    he passed it by, but, on the third inspection he discovered it,
    and placed his eye to it. In a moment he backed away,
    dejectedly. "I can't see worth a cent!" he bitterly complained.
    "It's not hole enough for me!" Lost, in his disappointment,
    even to shame for the wretched pun, he straightened up,
    surveying his immediate surroundings.</p>

    <p>Close by was the tree which Neb had also spoken of. He
    examined it with an appraising eye, then looked about to see
    what spectators were near. No one was in sight save a pair of
    piccaninnies, down the fence a hundred yards or so, with eyes
    glued to other knot-holes or to cracks.</p>

    <p>"To the deuce with dignity!" he cried. "I'll just inspect
    that tree."</p>

    <p>He was doing this with care, when, breathless and eager, a
    lady hurried toward him. As the tree intervened between them he
    did not see her coming, nor did she note his presence. It would
    have been quite plain to anyone who had observed her that she
    was engaged upon a quest much like that which he had pursued,
    for she carefully inspected each plank in the high fence, as,
    slowly and cautiously lest she should pass unheeded that which
    she was seeking eagerly, she made her way in his direction.</p>

    <p>"Everybody's at the races," she thought, comforting herself.
    "I'm perfectly safe. No one in the world will see me.... But
    where <i>is</i> that blessed knot-hole?"</p>

    <p>Suddenly her eye chanced on it, and, an instant later, was
    applied to it, the while the Colonel paused, with his back to
    her, still anxiously inspecting the tree.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said Miss Alathea, aloud, as she caught a glimpse of
    something interesting inside the fence.</p>

    <p>Instantly the Colonel turned and looked down at her,
    startled. Then: "A woman!" he exclaimed, beneath his breath. "A
    woman at my knot-hole!"</p>

    <p>Firmly determined to maintain his right he sternly
    approached her.</p>

    <p>"Madam!" he exclaimed, as incensed by her usurpation of the
    knot-hole as he would have been, at ordinary times, by theft of
    watch or pocket-book, and tapped her lightly on the
    shoulder.</p>

    <p>She shrank back from the knot-hole, startled and indignant.
    "Sir!" she cried, and then, as he recognized her, she turned
    and saw who had addressed her.</p>

    <p>"Colonel Sandusky Doolittle!" she exclaimed, amazed.</p>

    <p>"Miss Alathea Layson!" cried the Colonel, equally amazed, at
    first, but winding up his gesture of surprise with a low and
    courtly bow.</p>

    <p>"Colonel, what are you doing here?"</p>

    <p>"Madame," he countered, "what are <i>you</i> doing
    here?"</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea's dignity forsook her. "Colonel," she
    confessed, "I couldn't wait to hear the result."</p>

    <p>"No more could I," he somewhat sheepishly admitted.</p>

    <p>"But I didn't enter the race-track," she explained in
    haste.</p>

    <p>"I was equally firm."</p>

    <p>"And Neb told me of this knot-hole."</p>

    <p>"The rascal&mdash;he told me of it, too."</p>

    <p>"Colonel," she said, smiling, "we must forgive each other.
    If you really must look, there is the knot-hole."</p>

    <p>"No, Miss 'Lethe," he said gallantly, "<i>I</i> resign the
    knot-hole to you. I shall climb the tree." Without delay (for
    sounds from the barrier's far side hinted to his practiced ear
    that matters of much moment were progressing, there) he
    scrambled with much more difficulty than dignity into the
    spreading crotch.</p>

    <p>"Oh, be careful Colonel!" Miss Alathea cried, alarmed.
    "Don't break your neck!" But she added, as an afterthought:
    "But be sure to get where you can see."</p>

    <p>"Ah, what a gallant sight!" he cried as he found himself in
    a position whence he could command a view of the exciting scene
    within the barrier. "There's Catalpa ... and Evangeline ... and
    ... yes, there is Queen Bess!"</p>

    <p>A burst of cheering rose from the crowd within.</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea was on tip-toe with excitement. "What's that?"
    she begged.</p>

    <p>"A false start," he answered, scarcely even glancing down at
    her. "They'll make it this time, though," he added, and she
    could see his knuckles whiten with the strain as he gripped a
    rough limb of the tree with vise-like fingers.</p>

    <p>A moment later and the shouting became a very tempest of
    sound.</p>

    <p>"They're off!" he cried, staring through his field glasses
    in an excitement which promised, if he did not curb it, to send
    him tumbling from his shaky foothold. "Oh, what a splendid
    start!"</p>

    <p>"Who's ahead?" inquired Miss Alathea, very much excited.
    "Colonel, who's ahead?"</p>

    <p>"Catalpa sets the pace, the others lying well back."</p>

    <p>"Why doesn't Queen Bess come to the front?" Miss Alathea
    cried, as if he were to blame for the disquieting news he had
    reported to her. "Oh," she exclaimed, to the Colonel's great
    astonishment, "if I were only on that mare!"</p>

    <p>"At the half," the Colonel shouted, beside himself with
    worry, "Evangeline takes the lead ... Catalpa next ... the rest
    are bunched."</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea, at the moment, was trying to see
    satisfactorily, through the very knot-hole which the Colonel
    had abandoned. She sprang from it hastily, however, and to the
    foot of the tree which acted as his pedestal, when he
    exclaimed:</p>

    <p>"Oh, great heavens! There's a fall ... a jam ... and Queen
    Bess is left behind three lengths!" He leaned so far out that
    he heard the limb beneath him crack, and, in hastening to a
    firmer footing, almost lost his balance. This startled him,
    and, for an instant, took his eager gaze away from the
    struggling horses on the track within, but he quickly regained
    poise. "She hasn't the ghost of a show!" he cried,
    disheartened. "Look! Look!"</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea hugged the tree and looked, not at the horses,
    for that was quite impossible, but up at him with wide,
    imploring eyes.</p>

    <p>"She's at it again, though, now!" he cried. "It's beyond
    anything mortal, but she's gaining ... gaining!"</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea's excitement now was every bit as great as his.
    She had never seen a race in all her life, yet, now, she
    performed there at the foot of the great tree, a series of
    evolution not unlike those of many a "rooter" at the track
    within. She jumped up and down upon her toe's, clenched her
    hands and cried: "Oh, keep it up! Keep it up!"</p>

    <p>"At the three-quarters she's only five lengths behind the
    leader and still gaming!" cried the Colonel, in excited
    optimism.</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea could no longer endure the agony of waiting on
    the ground for his reports. Instead she tried to scramble to
    his side, but, failing, utterly, to accomplish this unaided,
    held her hands up to him, crying: "Oh, pull, pull! I can't
    stand it! I've just got to see!"</p>

    <p>The Colonel turned upon his perch and looked down at her,
    smiling. "Coming up, Miss 'Lethe?" he inquired. "All right,
    don't break your neck, but get where you can see." Hastily he
    gave her such assistance as his absorbed attention to the
    events within the fence permitted, and, with a wild scramble,
    she found herself close by his side, holding half to him, half
    to a curving branch.</p>

    <p>"Look! Look!" he cried, again. "In the stretch! Her head is
    at Catalpa's crupper ... now at her saddle-bow ... but she
    can't gain another inch. Still ... yes ... yes ... she lifts
    her! See!... See!... Great God! She wins!"</p>

    <p>Within the fence wild pandemonium broke loose. The crowd
    went mad with shouting. Hats, handkerchiefs, canes, umbrellas,
    flew into the air as if blown upward by the mad explosion of
    the crowd's enthusiasm. The band was playing "Dixie."</p>

    <p>Frank and Neb rushed forward to lift from the winner the
    victorious jockey, who by such superb riding as that track had
    never seen before, had snatched victory from defeat after the
    mare had been delayed in the bad pocket which, from his distant
    point of survey, had alarmed the Colonel. The jockey eluded
    them, however and, with face averted, hurried with the splendid
    mare back to the paddock, and there disappeared, disregarding
    the crowd's wild shouts of acclamation.</p>

    <p>Holton stood near Frank, white-faced and angry. Old Neb, as
    he ran beside Queen Bess, looked back at him and
    grinned.</p><br>

    <h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2><br>


    <p>Miss Alathea, on the day after the great race, sat waiting
    for the Colonel in the handsome old library of Woodlawn,
    worrying about her unconventionalities of the preceding day.
    When she heard his voice, out in the hall, telling Neb to carry
    certain bundles into the library and knew, of course, that he
    would follow after them almost immediately, her heart throbbed
    fiercely in her bosom. She shrank back into a window recess,
    too embarrassed to face him without first pausing to gather up
    her courage.</p>

    <p>"Put 'em there, Neb," said the Colonel, pointing to the
    table, and then, after the packages had been arranged to suit
    him: "Here, take this, and drink to the jockey that rode Queen
    Bess."</p>

    <p>"T'ankee, Marse Cunnel, t'ankee," Neb replied, pocketing the
    tip. "Oh, warn't it gran'? An' yo' climbed de tree, arter
    all!"</p>

    <p>"Sh! Clear out, you rascal!"</p>

    <p>Neb did not go at once, but, with the boldness of an old and
    privileged retainer, stood there, chuckling. "Climbed de tree!"
    he gurgled. "An' so did Miss 'Lethe!"</p>

    <p>With this he slapped his knee, and, laughing boisterously,
    left the room as the embarrassed lady of the house stepped out
    of her concealment.</p>

    <p>"Ah, Miss 'Lethe," said the Colonel, "good morning."</p>

    <p>"I expected you back from Lexington last night, Colonel."
    She looked at him reproachfully.</p>

    <p>"Stayed over to celebrate, my dear," the Colonel answered.
    "Stayed to celebrate the victory." With a beaming face he
    advanced upon the lady, plainly planning an embrace.</p>

    <p>But she eluded him. "Wait a moment, Colonel. On what did you
    celebrate?"</p>

    <p>The Colonel laughed. "Oh, I didn't forget. I celebrated on
    ginger-ale and soda-pop."</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea smiled with happy satisfaction. She eluded him
    no longer, but, herself, went to him and bestowed the kiss.</p>

    <p>"I doubt if my stomach ever recovers from the insult," said
    the Colonel, delighted by the kiss but remembering the mildness
    of the beverages which had marked his jubilation. "Miss 'Lethe,
    a julep&mdash;a mint-julep&mdash;before I perish."</p>

    <p>With a smile she crossed the room to where, upon the
    side-board (a side-board is an adjunct of all well-regulated
    libraries in old Kentucky), a snowy damask cloth concealed
    glorious somethings. With a graceful sweep she took it from
    them and revealed three juleps in their glory of green-crowns.
    "Look, Colonel!"</p>

    <p>"Three! Great heavens!" the Colonel cried, delighted. He
    took one and disposed of it in haste.</p>

    <p>"I mixed them myself," Miss 'Lethe said.</p>

    <p>The Colonel drank another, but less rapidly.</p>

    <p>"Remember," she said, warningly, "three and no more!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes," he granted. "I must save the other one." It was
    difficult to sip it, for Miss Alathea's juleps were like nectar
    to his thirsty palate, but he restrained himself and drank of
    this last ambrosial glass with great deliberation, trying to
    make it last as long as possible.</p>

    <p>"What are all those bundles, Colonel?" asked Miss Alathea,
    pointing to the packages which old Neb had brought in.</p>

    <p>"They're for Madge. She bought them yesterday." He sighed.
    "Ah, will you ever forget yesterday?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, don't speak of it!"</p>

    <p>"Can't help it." The Colonel waxed enthusiastic at the mere
    memory of the great occasion. "Whoopee!" he cried. "What a race
    it was!"</p>

    <p>"To think," said Miss Alathea, "that
    I&mdash;<i>I</i>&mdash;should enter a race-track!"</p>

    <p>"To think that <i>I</i>&mdash;should stay out of one!"</p>

    <p>"It was all your fault, Colonel," said Miss Alathea. "In
    your excitement after the race you grasped my hand and I was
    compelled to follow."</p>

    <p>"How strange!" exclaimed the Colonel, slowly, with a slight
    smile tickling at the corners of his mouth. "At times I fancied
    you were in the lead, I following."</p>

    <p>"Colonel," said the lady slowly, "perhaps I might as well
    confess. I've made a discovery. The sin isn't so much in
    looking at the horses run&mdash;it's in betting on them. That's
    where souls are lost."</p>

    <p>"And likewise money," said the Colonel, nodding,
    gravely.</p>

    <p>"So, Colonel, if you'll promise not to bet, I've no
    objection to your attending the races in moderation."</p>

    <p>In delighted amazement the Colonel forgot that that last
    julep could be brought to a quick end by hurried management and
    took a hasty and a mammoth swallow. "What!" he cried. "Can I
    believe it? Miss 'Lethe, you're an angel! It's the last drop in
    my cup of happiness!"</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea shyly smiled&mdash;smiled, indeed, a bit
    shame-facedly. "There's one condition, Colonel&mdash;that you
    take me along&mdash;yes, to watch over you."</p>

    <p>"Take you with me?" said the Colonel. He paused in puzzled
    contemplation of her for an instant. "Oh, I catch on. You'll go
    with the children to see the animals!" He laughed. "You rather
    like it." He became enthusiastic. "No more knot-holes or trees
    for us! At last&mdash;two souls with but a single thought, two
    hearts that beat when Queen Bess won! Here's to our future
    happiness!"</p>

    <p>He raised the glass and would have drunk from it, but, now,
    alas! the glass was empty. It surprised and grieved him, but,
    when Miss Alathea held her hand out, quietly, for the vessel
    which had held the final julep but which now held it no longer,
    he yielded it up gracefully nor asked her to refill it.</p>

    <p>As Miss Alathea placed the empty glass upon the side-board
    Madge entered from the hallway. She ran up to the Colonel. "I
    heard you'd come," she said, "an' couldn't wait. Say, air it
    all fixed about Queen Bess?"</p>

    <p>"Fixed?" cried the gallant horseman. "Well I should remark!
    Queen Bess is sold and paid for and a draft for the assessment
    forwarded to the Company. Inside of a year Frank will have the
    income of a prince."</p>

    <p>"All," said Miss Alathea, "owing to that mysterious jockey
    who disappeared immediately after the race. Oh, I'd like to
    kiss that boy!"</p>

    <p>"If you did, I should not be jealous," said the Colonel with
    an air of generosity.</p>

    <p>"Miss 'Lethe, kiss me. Won't I do as well?" Madge asked,
    going to her.</p>

    <p>Miss Alathea kissed her, but was still thinking of the
    unknown jockey, who, in the nick of time, had come from
    nowhere, materialized from nothing, to save the day for Frank
    by riding Queen Bess to victory. "I feel as if I must know his
    name," she said. "Madge, help me persuade the Colonel to tell
    us." She went to him and petted him. "Colonel, you will not
    refuse me!"</p>

    <p>Madge looked at him apprehensively, warningly. "An' I reckon
    you won't refuse me, Colonel." Then, going close to him, she
    whispered: "Remember, mum's the word!"</p>

    <p>"Away, you tempters, away!" the Colonel cried, and waved
    them from him. "It's a professional secret, and I've promised
    to keep it on the honor of a Kentucky gentleman&mdash;just as I
    promised you, Miss 'Lethe."</p>

    <p>"As you promised me? That's enough, Colonel&mdash;not
    another word!"</p>

    <p>Madge nodded, smilingly. "That's right, Colonel. Mustn't
    break your word." Just then she caught sight of the bundles
    which the Colonel had had Neb bring in. "Oh, are them my
    bundles, Colonel?"</p>

    <p>"Every one of them."</p>

    <p>The girl hurried to the mysteriously fascinating packages
    and began investigation of their contents. "Thank ye, thank
    ye!" she exclaimed, while she was busy with the wrappings.
    "Awful good of you to bring 'em." Then, to Miss Alathea in
    explanation: "Things I bought yesterday, Miss 'Lethe, all by
    myself. Jus' went wild. Reckon I'll let you an' th' Colonel see
    'em." She took a large, dressed doll out of its wrappings.
    "Look at that!"</p>

    <p>"What a beauty!" cried the Colonel.</p>

    <p>"Can talk, too." Madge pressed the wondrous puppet's shirred
    silk chest. "Ma-ma," it cried. "Ma-ma."</p>

    <p>"Never had nothin' but a rag-doll, myself," the girl went
    on, delighted by their approval of this automatic wonder.
    "'Tain't for me. It's for a little girl as lives up in th'
    mountings."</p>

    <p>From the doll she turned to an amazing jumping-jack, the
    next treasure taken from the packages. She pulled the toy's
    animating strings and watched its antics with delight. "Mos' as
    lively as a Kentucky Colonel climbin' a tree," said she, and
    laughed roguishly at the horseman. "Oh, I heard of it; I heard
    of it."</p>

    <p>The Colonel tried in vain to protest, Madge's laughter kept
    up merrily, as she took an old-fashioned carpet-sack from quite
    the biggest of the bundles and began to pack her purchases in
    it, until the Colonel and Miss Alathea left the room, gaily
    protesting at her ridicule.</p>

    <p>Instantly all of the signs of high elation vanished from the
    girl's face. She drooped. Left alone, it quickly became plain
    that her recent animation had been forced, unreal. "Well I
    guess I'd better not open up th' other bundles," she said
    listlessly. "I'll pack 'em as they be. It's time I started too.
    I'm goin' back to the mountings." Softly she hummed the air the
    darkies had been singing when she came into the
    room.</p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Weep no more, my
    lady, oh, weep no more to-day,</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">I will sing one song of my old
    Kentucky home,</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then my old Kentucky home,
    good-night!"</span><br>


    <p>There was infinite pathos in her half-unconscious rendition
    of the plaintive, darkey melody. To the mountain girl the
    moment was full of sadness. She had come down from her
    mountains to save the man she loved from the assassin's bullet
    and had saved him, not from that alone, but from a crushing
    blow to hope and fortune. Her work was done. All that now was
    left to her was to go back to her little cabin, hiding the
    secret of her love for him in her sore heart, enshrining,
    there, the memory of every minute she had ever passed with him
    as holy memories to comfort her in days to come. Melancholy
    thoughts pressed on her hard.</p>

    <p>Frank entered.</p>

    <p>He stopped short in the doorway, looking with amazement at
    her work of packing for departure.</p>

    <p>"Why, Madge!" said he. "What does this mean? Packing up!
    Surely you're not going away!" There was a thrill of real
    distress in his pleasant, vibrant voice which comforted
    her.</p>

    <p>"Yes, I'm going back to th' mountings. I was ... goin'
    afore, but I couldn't miss that hoss-race."</p>

    <p>"Madge," he cried impulsively, "you must not and you shall
    not go. I cannot bear to think of you wasting your life in the
    lonely mountains. Madge, your land will make you rich, and with
    your brightness you could study and learn. Education will make
    you an ornament to any society."</p>

    <p>She shook her head. "As fur as I can see," said she,
    "society ain't what it is cracked up to be. I don't seem to
    have no hankerin' after it. Oh, o' course, I'd like to have all
    this softness an' pootiness around me, always; I'd like to go
    out in th' world an' see th' wonders as I've heard of; but I
    don't think that 'u'd satisfy me. I'd still be hankerin' an'
    thirstin' arter somethin' that I couldn't have. There's been a
    feelin' in my heart, ever sence I come here, that'll take th'
    air o' th' mountings to cl'ar away. Like enough, up there among
    th' wild things that love me, amongst th' rocks an' hills, I'll
    find th' rest an' peace I ain't had since I come away."</p>

    <p>The youth looked at her with wide, worried eyes. He had not
    thought the situation out in any very careful detail; but he
    had, at no time, contemplated her immediate departure. Now that
    it seemed imminent it brought his feelings to a focus, showed
    him, instantly, that he could not bear to have this mountain
    maiden who had done so much for him thus vanish from his life.
    A realization that he loved her deeply, tenderly, unchangeably
    rushed over him. That she was a child of nature, uneducated and
    unaccustomed to the world he knew became a matter of but small
    importance to him as he stood there watching her, while, sadly
    but deliberately, she kept on with her work of packing in the
    carpet-bag her small possessions and the many gifts which she
    had purchased in the city for the children of her "mountings."
    That the world which he had ever thought his world might laugh
    at her and ridicule him if he married her he knew, but,
    suddenly, this seemed of little consequence. The errors in her
    education could be readily corrected and her heart and
    instincts were more nearly right, already, than those of any
    lowland girl whom he had ever known.</p>

    <p>"Madge," he cried, "I cannot give you up! I love you!"</p>

    <p>The girl's hands stopped their busy work among the bundles.
    Her cheeks paled and her lips parted to a gasping little intake
    of breath. It had not, once, occurred to her modest,
    self-sacrificing mind that, even as the bluegrass gentleman had
    found her heart and taken it forever and forever to be his own,
    no matter where she was or how great might the distance be
    which separated them, so, also, had his heart really and
    forever passed to her, the simple, unlettered and untrained
    little maiden of the wilderness. It seemed impossible,
    incredible.</p>

    <p>"You love me!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I love you as I never have, as I never can love any
    other woman. Madge, dearest, I want you for my wife!"</p>

    <p>The great desire, the certainty that if he did not win her
    then all other triumphs would be empty, meaningless, had come
    suddenly upon him, but it had come with overwhelming force. His
    voice was vibrant with a passion which surprised himself.</p>

    <p>"No, no; it can never be!" she said tremulously. Her heart
    was in a turmoil, her hands trembled with excitement. Ah, it
    was hard for her to put away from her the brilliant vista which
    had opened there before her startled eyes! But she was sure
    that she must do it; that if she loved this man she must
    forswear him for his own dear sake. What right had she, a
    mountain-girl, to come down there to the bluegrass to shame him
    in the face of friends and foes by her ignorance and
    awkwardness? Her heart yearned toward him with a warmth and
    fervor which she had not known as possible to human longings,
    but&mdash;no, no, for his sake she must give him up, as, for
    his sake, she had made the long, desperate journey from the
    mountains to save him from Joe Lorey's bullet, as, for his
    sake, shrinking and dismayed, conscious that in doing it she
    might very well be sacrificing his respect for her, she had
    donned the blouse and breeches of a jockey, yesterday, to ride
    his mare to victory when none other had been there to save the
    day for him. That had been a sacrifice almost beyond the power
    of words to tell&mdash;a sacrifice of modesty; now came an even
    greater one, but one which, none the less, must certainly be
    made. "No, no," said she again, "it can never, never be!"</p>

    <p>"But I want you&mdash;just as you are! What do I care for
    the world, without you, or for what it says, so long as you are
    mine?"</p>

    <p>A flood of bitterness rushed to her heart. Ah, why, why, had
    fate made it so necessary that, to save him, she must do what,
    yesterday, she had been forced to do!</p>

    <p>"You're thinkin' of my ignorance, an' such," she said, with
    sad eyes bent upon the gifts which, now, although she looked at
    them, she did not see and had forgotten. "But there's more nor
    that as stands between us, Mr. Frank."</p>

    <p>"You mean you don't love me?"</p>

    <p>"No, no; oh, what air th' use o' denyin' it? I love you!
    It's that&mdash;it's that that drives me from you, an' that
    breaks&mdash;my&mdash;heart!"</p>

    <p>He went close to her and tried to take her hands in his.
    "Madge, dear," he said softly, "I want you to listen to me. I
    tell you I shall not let any foolish pride or any fears for the
    future stand in the way of our happiness. When I thought, a
    moment ago, that I might lose you forever, I saw what my life
    would be without you; and, now that I know you love me, nothing
    shall come between us. Madge, dear heart, I want you to put
    your hand in mine."</p>

    <p>She drew away, but it was plain that she was sorely tempted.
    "Ah, if I only dared!" said she.</p>

    <p>"Come, Madge, darling!" he said fervently, opening his arms
    to fold her to his heart.</p>

    <p>"No, no," she said, "it wouldn't be right." The Colonel's
    words: "We'd think it an eternal shame and a disgrace for one
    of our women to ride a race in a costume such as you have on,"
    rang in her mind and filled her with despair. "The Colonel
    said&mdash;" she began, weakly.</p>

    <p>"Oh, damn the Colonel!" Frank cried angrily, wondering why
    any one should meddle with his heart-affairs.</p>

    <p>And as he spoke the Colonel entered hurriedly, evidently
    bearing news of import.</p>

    <p>Startled by the young man's earnest words, he stopped short
    in astonishment. "Why&mdash;what's that, sir?" he exclaimed
    amazed, and then, seeing clearly that he had broken in upon a
    fervent sentimental situation and unwilling to believe that
    Frank could really have meant him when he had been so emphatic,
    turned his thoughts, again, to the news which had brought him
    in such haste.</p>

    <p>"I say," he said, excitedly, "I've been cross-examining that
    rascal, Ike, and I've found out who smuggled the whiskey to
    him."</p>

    <p>"Who was it?" Madge and Frank cried almost in unison.</p>

    <p>"That double-distilled, three-ply scoundrel, Horace Holton,"
    said the Colonel, angrily.</p>

    <p>"Holton!" Frank exclaimed. "I wouldn't have believed
    it!"</p>

    <p>"I would," Madge commented.</p>

    <p>"I'll find him and settle with him for it!" Frank angrily
    exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid that's easier said than done," the Colonel
    answered, "but I'm with you, and we'll do our best."</p>

    <p>Through the windows came the noise of baying hounds. It
    instantly attracted their attention, as it ever will that of
    Kentuckians. "What's that? A fox-hunt?"</p>

    <p>Frank had hurried to the window and was looking out. "No,"
    he answered, in incredulous amazement, "it's Holton and his
    gang. They're hunting Joe Lorey with dogs!"</p>

    <p>Madge hurried to his side, distressed beyond the power of
    words to tell. "Oh, oh!" she cried. "They're coming this way,
    and&mdash;and&mdash;who's that?"</p>

    <p>As she spoke Joe Lorey dashed up, breathless to the
    window.</p><br>

    <center><hr style="width: 65%;"></center>

    <h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2><br>


    <p>The moonshiner stood there, pathetic in his beaten strength
    before them.</p>

    <p>"They're huntin' me with dogs!" he said. "They're goin' to
    string me up without justice or mercy!"</p>

    <p>Madge hurried to his side. "Joe, they shan't do it!" she
    exclaimed, and took his hand.</p>

    <p>"It'll take more nor you to save me, little one," he said,
    and smiled down at her pitifully. "There's no hope for me, now.
    That's why I've come hyar, to say to you all, afore I die, that
    I am innocent o' firin' th' stable." He threw back his
    shoulders and stood before them, impressive and convincing.
    "Afore God, I am innocent!"</p>

    <p>Frank looked at him with eyes which, as they gazed, altered
    their expression. He had thought the man quite possibly guilty
    of a vicious act&mdash;a foul attempt to burn a helpless animal
    in order to obtain revenge upon the man who owned her. But as
    he gazed he could not doubt that he was speaking simple truth.
    "Joe," he said impulsively, "I believe you!"</p>

    <p>Joe turned to him with gratitude plain upon his face. "You
    believe me&mdash;arter all that's passed?" He looked straight
    into the eyes of the young man he had hated, with a searching,
    earnest gaze. "Then," he said, after a second's pause, "I
    believe as what you said, that night, war true. It war never
    you as ruined me." He held his hand out to the man whom, not so
    long ago, he had wished, with all his heart, to kill.</p>

    <p>Frank grasped it with a hearty grip, just as the terrifying
    baying of the hounds approached the house.</p>

    <p>"Frank, they're coming here!" the Colonel cried,
    excited.</p>

    <p>Joe turned away from Frank, looking here and there like a
    hunted animal. "Oh, it's hard to die afore I've met Lem
    Lindsay!" he said hopelessly. It was quite plain that he
    considered his fate sealed.</p>

    <p>Even as he spoke Holton and half-a-dozen others sprang to
    the broad gallery which fronted the whole room. Holton was
    plainly the leader of the party, for when he motioned all the
    others back, they obeyed his signal without protest, while he,
    himself, peered eagerly in through a wide, open window.</p>

    <p>Frank, angered beyond measure by this bold intrusion, would
    have sprung toward him, to attack him, had not the Colonel
    waved him back.</p>

    <p>"Frank, my boy," said he, "keep cool, keep cool!"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, without apology, Holton stepped through the
    window into the room, itself.</p>

    <p>"Layson," he said curtly, "I'm a committee o' one to ask if
    you'll turn over that man, an' make no trouble." He jerked a
    thumb toward Joe.</p>

    <p>Layson was wrathful at the man's intrusion; he had been
    impressed by what the fugitive had said. "No," he answered,
    hotly. "Joe Lorey's in my house, under my protection, and, by
    the eternal, you shan't lay a hand on him!"</p>

    <p>The Colonel smiled, delighted. "Kentucky blood!" he cried.
    "I'll back you to a finish!"</p>

    <p>He ranged himself by Frank, and Madge, as belligerent as
    either of them, hurried, also, to his side.</p>

    <p>"I'm with you, Colonel," she exclaimed, with the spirit of
    the mountain-bred, "and we'll win ag'in, as we did once
    before!"</p>

    <p>Joe saw this with distress. Layson's generosity had softened
    him. He knew, perfectly, by this time, that Madge was not for
    him, and her spirit in joining his defenders&mdash;the very men
    whom he had thought his enemies&mdash;touched him deeply. The
    realization came to him with a quick rush that he had wronged
    the bluegrass folk whom he had hated with such bitterness. He
    looked first at those who wished to take him prisoner and make
    him suffer for a crime of which he was not guilty, and then at
    his defenders, who had every reason to doubt him, but still,
    without a question, had accepted his own plea of innocence. He
    had already made these people trouble. Now was his opportunity
    to save them from an awkward situation and, perhaps, a perilous
    one. There might be shooting if he offered to resist or let
    these good friends attempt to defend him. That would endanger
    them, and, worse, endanger Madge. "I'll go. I don't want to
    make no trouble," he said hastily.</p>

    <p>Holton nodded with approval. He wished to take the man as
    quickly and as simply as he could. Every complication which
    could be avoided would make less probable discovery of the fact
    that he, himself, and not the fugitive young mountaineer, was
    the real culprit.</p>

    <p>"That's sensible," he said, "for them men, out thar, are
    bound to hev you, by fair means or foul."</p>

    <p>"Those men will listen to reason," Frank said with a
    determination which disconcerted the ex-slave dealer. "They
    shall hear me!" He stepped toward the open window. "Colonel,
    come with me." Without waiting for him he stepped to the
    gallery outside.</p>

    <p>The Colonel started to go also, but, seeing that Holton,
    too, was about to hurry out, paused long enough to go up to him
    threateningly. "Don't you dare to follow!" he warned him.
    "We'll play this hand alone." The man fell back and the Colonel
    kept his eyes on him as, slowly, he joined Frank on the
    gallery.</p>

    <p>Holton's discomfiture lasted but a moment. As soon as the
    Colonel had passed out of sight he got his wits back and looked
    threateningly at Madge and the mountaineer. "We'll see about
    that," he declared viciously, and, making a movement of his
    hand which indicated that he must be armed, although he had not
    shown a weapon, so far, moved toward another window which also
    opened on the gallery.</p>

    <p>But he had not counted on old Neb. The darkey found in this
    emergency the opportunity for which he had been waiting many
    years. Lapse of time had never dulled his keen resentment of
    the blow the man had struck him; now it was with keen delight
    that he stepped out of the shadow just outside the window, with
    a carelessly held pistol in his hand, which somehow appeared to
    cover Holton. "De Cunnel said you'd please stay heah, suh," he
    said placidly; but the pistol gave his words an emphasis which
    could not be mistaken.</p>

    <p>Holton paled with rage, but did not take another forward
    step.</p>

    <p>As he fell back Joe Lorey spoke. The murmur of the mob
    outside, incited, he well knew, to hunger for his life, and the
    loud voices of the Colonel and of Frank, raised in
    expostulation, made an accompaniment for what he had to say to
    Holton, and that he still was in grave danger made his attitude
    more menacing, his words more impressive.</p>

    <p>"Yes," he said to Holton, while Madge gazed, spellbound,
    "you hold on. I've a word to say to you."</p>

    <p>"Say it, then, and say it quick," said Holton, trying to
    make his tone contemptuous.</p>

    <p>"I'll say it quick, and I'll say it plain. You know as it
    war never me as fired that stable. You war there an' saw me
    leave afore th' fire. It's yer place to cl'ar me. Why air you
    a-houndin' me to my death?"</p>

    <p>Holton was uncomfortable. "Them men out thar believe ye
    guilty. It ain't my work," he said.</p>

    <p>The mountaineer was not deceived. He knew this man to be his
    enemy, although he knew no reason for his hatred. "It's you as
    air settin' 'em on," he said, "as you set me on Frank Layson
    when you told me that lie ag'in him in th' mountings."</p>

    <p>Madge had listened, speechless, during this dramatic scene,
    but stood watching it, alert and ready to lend aid to her
    friend, if opportunity arose. Now, at Joe's words, she started
    forward.</p>

    <p>"Was it him as told you?" she inquired, amazed.</p>

    <p>Joe did not answer her, but continued to face Holton and
    address him. "I believed you," he went on, "because I thought
    you couldn't a-knowed o' th' still except through him; but
    since he never told you, it air proof to me that you have been
    in these here mountings, sometime, afore." Strange suspicions
    were glittering from his hostile eyes as he faced the now
    thoroughly alarmed man who, a moment since, had been the
    blustering bully.</p>

    <p>"I tell you I were never thar!" said Holton hurriedly.</p>

    <p>"Then how did you know of th' cave an' the oak?" said Joe,
    accusingly. The glitter of suspicion in his eyes was growing
    brighter every second. "It's plain to me as how you've passed
    many a day thar in them mountings. Thar's somethin' bound up in
    yer past as has egged you on ag'in me. I wants to know what
    that thing is&mdash;I wants to know just who an' what ye
    air!"</p>

    <p>"It's easy enough to show who Horace Holton is," the man
    said, blustering, but he was very ill at ease. "What do I care
    what you want?" And then he made a slip. "You can't bring no
    proof&mdash;" he began, but caught himself.</p>

    <p>Madge had been watching him with new intentness. The
    excitement of the moment may have sharpened the girl's wits,
    or, possibly, its hint of peril may have brought to Holton's
    face some detail of expression, which, during recent weeks, had
    not before appeared upon it.</p>

    <p>"But I kin," she said, slowly. "I war right in what I
    thought when I first saw you in th' mountings. I <i>had</i>
    seen your face afore!"</p>

    <p>"Don't you dare say that!" cried Holton, stepping toward her
    angrily. The man who had been the accuser, was, strangely, now,
    quite plainly, half at bay.</p>

    <p>"That look ag'in!" the girl said, studying his face. "That
    look war printed on my baby brain!"</p>

    <p>"Silence, I say!" cried Holton, now badly frightened. He had
    not counted on this recognition.</p>

    <p>"Never!" the girl said boldly. She was certain, now, as she
    looked at him, that the suspicion which had flashed into her
    mind was accurate. Her cheeks paled and she stepped toward him
    with set face, clenched hands. Every fibre in her thrilled with
    horror of him, every drop of blood in her young body cried for
    vengeance on him. "I'll rouse th' world ag'in ye!" she
    exclaimed, so tensely that even Lorey looked at her with
    alarmed amazement. "I'll rouse th' world ag'in ye, for I'm
    standin' face to face with my own father's murderer&mdash;Lem
    Lindsay!"</p>

    <p>"Lem Lindsay!" said Joe, wonderingly, and then, with the
    expression on his face of a wild-beast about to spring upon his
    prey: "At last!"</p>

    <p>Holton shrank away from them in terror which he could not
    hide. His bravado was all gone. He was, no longer, the accuser,
    but, with the mention of that name, had changed places with Joe
    Lorey and become the fugitive, shrinking, alarmed.</p>

    <p>"'Sh! Don't speak that name!" he pleaded. He made no effort
    at denial. There was that in the girl's eyes which told him
    that her recognition had been absolute. "I've been hidin' it
    for years." He spoke pleadingly. "Look hyar. I've got
    everythin' that heart can wish. Joe Lorey, I'll save you from
    them men. I'll sw'ar I saw you leave the stable afore th' fire
    begun." He moved his eyes from one of the accusing faces to the
    other, terrified. "I'll make ye both rich if you'll never speak
    that name ag'in!"</p><a name="Illus_5"></a> <br>

    <br>


    <p>"Your weight in gold would make no differ!" Joe cried
    menacingly. "Lem Lindsay, it air Heaven's work that's given you
    into my hands!" He went toward him slowly, menacingly, with his
    strong fingers working with desire to clutch his shrinking
    throat. "It air Heaven's will as you should meet your fall
    through Ben Lorey's son!"</p>

    <p>Holton, desperate, gathered courage for a last effort to
    escape from the net which he had woven to his own undoing. With
    a quick movement he drew from his belt, where his long coat had
    concealed its presence, hitherto, a gleaming knife, and, with
    it upraised, rushed at Joe viciously. "I'm a free man, yet," he
    cried, "an' I'm a-goin' to stay free!"</p>

    <p>Joe, alert, calm-eyed, cool-witted, waited for him with a
    hand upraised to catch his wrist, with muscles braced to meet
    the fierce attack.</p>

    <p>Madge rushed to the window, calling loudly: "Colonel! Mr.
    Frank!"</p>

    <p>But Holton and Joe Lorey were, by that time, locked in a
    desperate grip and struggling with the energy of men battling
    for their lives. Twisting and straining, each striving with the
    last ounce of energy within him to get the better of the other,
    they plunged across the room and out into the hall.</p>

    <p>Just as Frank and the Colonel hurried in, a shot was heard
    and then a heavy fall. An instant later Joe came to the
    door.</p>

    <p>"Heaven's will are done!" he said, quite simply.</p>

    <p>Layson rushed toward him, but paused, aghast, looking off
    through the open door. "Joe, you've killed him!" he
    exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"An' I had a right!" said Joe, now strangely calm. "When he
    killed my father it were ordained that he should fall by my
    hands. I ain't afeared to stand my trial."</p>

    <p>"The men outside have promised," Layson said, dismayed by
    this new and terrible complication, "that you shall have a fair
    trial on the other charge. They've gone, now, for the sheriff.
    But this charge," he looked toward the door which led into the
    hall, "will be more serious!"</p>

    <p>"I can clear him of 'em both," said Madge. "I'll sw'ar th'
    killin' was in self-defense; I'll sw'ar that Holton owned,
    before me, that he saw Joe leave th' stable afore th'
    fire."</p>

    <p>"He saw him!" exclaimed Frank, astonished. "What was Holton
    doing there?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, don't you see?" said Madge. "He war your
    enemy&mdash;th' man as told Joe th' lie ag'in you in th'
    mountings, th' man as tried to burn Queen Bess."</p>

    <p>The Colonel had entered, quickly, from the gallery, and
    stood listening, amazed and fascinated. Now, after a moment's
    pause to think the matter out, he advanced to Joe with
    outstretched hand. For the man who had been guilty of that vile
    mischief he felt no regret, for the man who had, in a fair
    fight and with good reason, shot him down, he felt full
    sympathy. "Tried to burn Queen Bess!" he cried. "Joe, the
    jury'll clear you without leaving their seats! Come, my
    boy&mdash;the sheriff's here, and you will have to go with him;
    but don't you worry. I'll see you through."</p>

    <p>Joe stood, thinking, with bowed head and frowning brow.
    Suddenly he looked up and cast his eyes about upon the company.
    "Before I goes, I wants to say a word to Madge," said he, and
    turned to her with an impressive earnestness. "Little one,
    don't you never fret about me, no more." He took her hand and
    she gave it to him gladly. "I see, now, as you was never made
    for me." He took a step toward Frank and led her to him. "I see
    whar your heart is, an' I puts your hand in his." With bowed
    head he relinquished the brown hand of the mountain-girl whom
    he had loved since childhood, to the outstretched hand of the
    young "foreigner," whom he no longer looked at with the hatred
    which had so long thrilled his heart. "And&mdash;now I says
    good-bye. God bless you both!"</p>

    <p>He went out, slowly, with the Colonel.</p>

    <p>"Madge, he's right," said Frank, "this little hand is
    mine."</p>

    <p>He would have clasped her in his arms, but, finally, she
    held him off.</p>

    <p>"No, no," said she, "not till you know my secret. It was I
    who rode Queen Bess,"</p>

    <p>"You rode Queen Bess!"</p>

    <p>The Colonel was re-entering the room. "But the world will
    never know it," he said gallantly, "on the honor of a
    Kentuckian."</p>

    <p>Frank's smile was radiant. "If it did, I should say: 'Here,
    Madge, in my arms, is your shelter from the world.'" He drew
    her to him gently. "Madge, my little wife!"</p><br>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
