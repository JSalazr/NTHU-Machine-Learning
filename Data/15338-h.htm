    <h2>PREFACE</h2>

    <p>The success of the Toaster's Handbook has encouraged its
    publishers to compile another that will supplement it and bring
    it up-to-date. New subjects keep coming to the front, and the
    up-to-date toaster needs up-to-date stories to fit the
    up-to-date subjects. No public occasion of today is complete
    without its joke on the nineteenth amendment, the allied debts,
    the income tax, etc.</p>

    <p>In offering the toasts, jokes, quotations and stories in
    this second volume, the editor has endeavored to bring further
    aid to the distracted toastmaster, to the professional
    after-dinner speaker who must change his stories often, and to
    individuals inexperienced in public speaking and so unfortunate
    as to have public addresses forced upon them. He views the
    product with much the same feeling as did Alexander Pope, who
    said, "O'er his books his eyes began to roll, in pleasing
    memory of all he stole."</p>

    <p>Paolo Bellezze expressed the same feelings in the
    introduction to his work "Humor" when he said "Of this work of
    mine, I must confess it is a great lot of stuff gathered from
    everywhere except from my brain.... It is a necklace of pearls
    strung upon a slender cord; that, I have put there; the pearls
    have been furnished me by the most famous jewelers, native and
    foreign. This said, I can&mdash;without being accused of
    pride&mdash;recommend it to my respectable customers as an
    article of great value and of absolute novelty."</p>

    <p>In making this collection, files of such magazines as Life,
    Judge, Puck and Punch were drawn on extensively; also magazines
    having humorous pages or columns, such as the Literary Digest,
    Ladies' Home Journal, Everybody's, Harper's; also Bindery Talk
    and various other house organs. According to Samuel Johnson "A
    man will turn over half a library to make one book," and the
    compiler of this one makes humble acknowledgment to a whole
    library of books and periodicals where most of these jokes have
    already appeared. It has been impossible to give credit unless
    the place of first publication was definitely known.</p>

    <p>The compiling of "More Toasts" was in large measure
    cooperative. The test of the humor of a story or joke is in its
    efficacy when applied to normal people under ordinary
    circumstances. With this philosophy in mind the editor made it
    a rule to include nothing until it had first been "tried on the
    dog." The original material was first graded into three classes
    and, before being accepted, each joke had to stand the test of
    appealing to the sense of humor of several persons. The result
    is a collection of very carefully selected jokes and stories,
    only about fifty per cent of the material originally chosen
    being used. If any over-critical reader fails to find them
    humorous, may not the fault possibly be due to his own
    imperfect sense of humor?</p>

    <p>There is also much truth in the statement that the point of
    a jest lies in the telling of it and often much of the subtle
    humor is lost in the reading. The personality of the speaker is
    a necessary factor and is frequently more important in the
    effect produced by the story than the story itself. Elbert
    Hubbard once said "Next in importance to the man who first
    voices a great thought is the man who quotes it."</p>

    <p>The clever compiler, like a good chef, must not only know
    what to select but in what order to present it. Knowledge
    consists in being able to find a thing when you want it and
    accordingly an attempt has been made to pigeonhole each joke
    where it would be most useful. Such a classification is at best
    a difficult and debatable question, and numerous cross
    references have been placed wherever it was thought they might
    direct the reader to the subject wanted.</p>

    <p>With these few explanatory words, the editor presents this
    little volume, sincerely hoping that it may prove a friend in
    need to all who seek the relaxation of humor, and a lifesaver
    to that legion of humble men whose knees tremble when the
    chairman speaks those fateful words&mdash;"The next speaker of
    the evening...."</p>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p>What can be more fitting than that a compiled book should
    have a compiled introduction? Why should one with great pains
    and poor prospects of success attempt to do what has already
    been well done? Knowing that all readers of this book have a
    sense of humor and that they will approve our decision we begin
    with a quotation from an article<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       by Mr. E. Lyttelton.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <h4><i>The Divine Gift of Humor</i></h4>

      <p>The subject of humor has an attraction peculiarly its own,
      because it deals with a mystery which yet is pleasantly
      interwoven with the daily life of each one of us. We often say
      of one of our neighbors that he has no sense of humour. But he
      often laughs; he never spends a day without at least trying to
      laugh, tho it remains but an attempt, an effort, an aspiration
      after something which he seems to have lost but wishes to
      recover. Either, that is, he remains grave when others laugh,
      or he laughs, as Horace says, "with alien jaws," by constraint
      rather than because he cannot help it. He has a confused idea
      that it is expected of him. Such laughter is apparently the
      outcome of an uneasy sense of duty, a dismal travesty of the
      real thing....</p>

      <p>Certainly humour is a singularly elusive thing, and I doubt
      if anyone alive can explain it; but its elusiveness gives it
      something of its charm; and, moreover, the illustrations which
      are necessary to an inquiry into its nature, its scope and
      meaning, are apt to be amusing without being irrelevant.</p>

      <p>Humour has often been roughly described as a sense of the
      incongruous. More satisfying, however, is the following, which
      has been ascribed to Dean Inge: It is a sense of incongruous
      emotions. As soon as we think of the emotions being stirred we
      see that the strange difference between humourous and
      unhumourous people is not an intellectual matter, but follows
      the general law of emotional susceptibility, viz., that it is
      independent of the reason and varies within wide limits with
      each individual, and obviously with each nationality. Moreover,
      it appears that, as it is compounded of two emotions, one man
      may feel one of the emotions but be dull to the other,
      according to his temperament. It is a matter of sensitiveness,
      and in sensitiveness no two of us are alike.</p>

      <p>Crudely judged, then, humour may be described as a blessing
      of nature bestowed on all, but in widely varying measure, so
      that in the case of some of our acquaintance we deplore its
      non-existence, but never in ourselves. Nobody really believes
      that he is wholly without it, partly because, in proportion as
      the sense is really defective, the defect must be in its own
      nature unperceived, but also because the gift is so precious,
      so winsome, that no one could bear to believe that it has been
      denied him. By a merciful law of nature, the delusion is
      unsuspected, for assuredly, if any wholly unhumorous person
      once realised the full extent of his privation, nothing could
      save him from "wretchlessness" and despair.</p>

      <p>I prefer to believe that, like the sense of beauty, the love
      of music, the thrill of admiration for uncalculating heroism,
      we have here a wondrous aid to us in our life's pilgrimage, but
      that if we trace it to a sense of our self-interest, we not
      only vulgarize it, but we turn it into a caricature. For there
      is in humour this singular property; its aroma is so subtle,
      delicate and undefinable that the effort to buttress it upon
      coarse, common utility is doomed to fail, and in the mere
      attempt humour vanishes. There is something deliciously
      contagious about laughter that is quite sincere and unthinking;
      whereas the only people who contrive to be always absurd, but
      never amusing, are those who laugh from a sense of duty.</p>

      <p>Humour, then, in the young is restricted in scope, their
      experience of life being small; in women it is quicker than in
      men, but shallower; in the Scotch it is reticent, in the Irish
      voluble and refined, but cold. But wherever it is found free
      from counterfeit, wholesome and contagious, it is the offspring
      of man's heaven-bestowed power of seeing in the meannesses of
      earth the true presence of the Divine.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Darwin says the causes of humor are legion and exceedingly
    complex and various disquisitions upon humor and laughter would
    seem to support him. Its social nature is emphasized by Edwin
    Paxton Hood:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The sources of all laughter and merriment are in the
        cordial sympathies of our nature. Laughter is very nearly
        related to the highest and most instinctive wisdom; it
        stands at no distant remove from Judgment on the one hand,
        and Imagination on the other; and it is a proof of a
        healthy nature, for both thinking and acting.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>C.S. Evans in his article "On Humor in Literature" gives a
    hint of the evolutionary process of its mechanism and its
    higher refinement:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>On the lower plane of humor you get a laugh by the most
        unimaginative means&mdash;merely conceive a recognized
        humorous situation, or bring several things together
        according to a recipe, and the thing is done. Every
        practised comedian, in literature or on the stage, is an
        adept at it. But the creation of character, the
        expression&mdash;in terms of the words and actions of men
        and women&mdash;of that "social gesture" which is
        laughter's source, is a much greater thing, for there we
        touch the symbolism which is the soul of art.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />

    <h4><i>The Function of Humor</i></h4>

    <p>In an article entitled "Why Do We Laugh?" William McDougall
    discusses scientifically the value of laughter:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Laughter of man presents a problem with which
        philosophers have wrestled in all ages with little success.
        Man is the only animal that laughs. And, if laughter may
        properly be called an instinctive reaction, the instinct of
        laughter is the only one peculiar to the human
        species....</p>

        <p>We are saved from this multitude of small sympathetic
        pains and depressions by laughter, which, as we have seen,
        breaks up our train of mental activity and prevents our
        dwelling upon the distressing situation, and which also
        provides an antidote to the depressing influence in the
        form of physiological stimulation that raises the
        blood-pressure and promotes the circulation of the blood.
        This, then, is the biological function of laughter, one of
        the most delicate and beautiful of all nature's
        adjustments. In order that man should reap the full
        benefits of life in the social group, it was necessary that
        his primitive sympathetic tendencies should be strong and
        delicately adjusted. For without this, there could be
        little mutual understanding, and only imperfect cooperation
        and mutual aid in the more serious difficulties and
        embarrassments of life. But, in endowing man with
        delicately responsive sympathetic tendencies, nature
        rendered him liable to suffer a thousand pains and
        depressions upon a thousand occasions of mishap to his
        fellows, occasions so trivial as to call for no effort of
        support or assistance. Here was a dilemma&mdash;whether to
        leave man so little sympathetic that he would be incapable
        of effective social life; or to render him effectively
        sympathetic and leave him subject to the perpetually
        renewed pains of sympathy, which, if not counteracted,
        would seriously depress his vitality and perhaps destroy
        the species. Nature, confronted with this problem, solved
        it by the invention of laughter. She endowed man with the
        instinct to laugh on contemplation of these minor mishaps
        of his fellow men; and so made them occasions of actual
        benefit to the beholder; all those things which, apart from
        laughter, would have been mildly displeasing and
        depressing, became objects and occasions of stimulating
        beneficial laughter....</p>

        <p>For laughter is no exception to the law of primitive
        sympathy; but rather illustrates it most clearly and
        familiarly; the infectiousness of laughter is notorious and
        as irresistible as the infection of fear itself.... The
        great laugher is the person of delicately responsive
        sympathetic reactions; and his laughter quickly gives place
        to pity and comforting support, if our misfortune waxes
        more severe. Such persons are in little danger of giving
        offense by their laughter; for we detect their ready
        sympathy and easily laugh with them; they teach us to be
        humorous.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>H. Merian Allen in his essay "Little Laughs in History" says
    "The relaxation of a full laugh clears the brain, restores fit
    contact with one's fellows, and so smoothes the way for the
    solving of knotty problems."</p>

    <p>Linus W. Kline, Ph.D., further elucidates the psychical
    office of humor as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The psychical function of humor is to delicately cut the
        surface tension of consciousness and disarrange its
        structure that it may begin again from a new and
        strengthened base. It permits our mental forces to reform
        under cover, as it were, while the battle is still on.
        Then, too, it clarifies the field and reveals the
        strategetic points, or, to change the figure, it pulls off
        the mask and exposes the real man. No stimulus, perhaps
        more mercifully and effectually breaks the surface tension
        of consciousness, thereby conditioning the mind for a
        stronger forward movement, than that of humor. It is the
        one universal dispensary for human kind: a medicine for the
        poor, a tonic for the rich, a recreation for the fatigued
        and a beneficient check to the strenuous. It acts as a
        shield to the reformer, as an entering wedge to the recluse
        and as a decoy for barter and trade.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Humor is as necessary to our mental and spiritual life as
    are vitamins to our physical well-being. Ruskin has called our
    attention to the tendency of rivers to lean a little to one
    side, to have "One shingly shore upon which they can be shallow
    and foolish and childlike, and another steep shore under which
    they can pause and purify themselves and get their strength of
    waves fully together for due occasions," and has likened them
    to great men who must have one side of their life for work and
    another for play. Action and reaction must be balanced:
    seriousness and lightness. "Men who work prodigously must play
    with equal energy," says one commentator. "Humor is the gift of
    the deeply serious man," remarks another. "There have been very
    few solemn men, but their solemnity was evidence, not of their
    gifts, but of their defects; as a rule greatness is accompanied
    by the overflow of the fountain of life in play." "The richly
    furnished mind overflows with vitality and deals with ideas and
    life freely, daringly, often audaciously."</p>

    <p>The function of the catalyst in chemical reactions is to
    help other bodies to get on together, but in doing this it only
    lends its presence.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>CATALYST. A chemical body which by its presence, is
        capable of inducing chemical changes in other bodies while
        itself remaining unchanged.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In quite the same way humor, by its mere presence, serves to
    smooth the way in all human relations. It contributes a
    socializing touch. "Humor makes the whole world akin."</p>
    <hr />

    <h4><i>Importance of Humor</i></h4>

    <p>Not only the toastmaster needs to have a sense of humor and
    a collection of funny stories, and not only the preacher, the
    public speaker and entertainer, but everyone, as well, who must
    influence others. The "voice with a smile" wins because behind
    the voice is a sense of humor. We have more confidence in those
    who have a sense of humor. The following is quoted from a
    persuasive advertisement entitled "The Gentle Art of Telling a
    Humorous Story Well":</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The most successful men and women are those who know how
        to get along with their fellow-beings, who know how to win
        and hold good will. In fact, the biggest problem in
        business and society today is the human problem, the
        problem of making people like you and making people feel
        kindly towards each other.</p>

        <p>And nothing oils the wheels of human relationship so
        nicely as humor. Abraham Lincoln understood this when he
        saved many a critical situation by the introduction of one
        of his famous anecdotes. Humor has its place in serious
        business life, and in social life it is the universal
        passport to popularity.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The importance of humor in our daily life, often emphasized
    by scientists and philosophers, has been well summarized by
    Justin McCarthy in an article "Humor as an Element of
    Success":</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I am strongly of the opinion that the quick and abiding
        sense of humour is a great element of success in every
        department of life. I do not speak merely of success in the
        more strictly artistic fields of human work, but am willing
        to maintain that even in the prosaic and practical concerns
        of human existence, the sense of humour is an exciting and
        sustaining influence to carry a man successfully thru to
        the full development of his capacity and the attainment of
        his purpose....</p>

        <p>In the stories of great events and great enterprises we
        are constantly told of some heaven-born leader who kept
        alive, thru the most trying hours of what otherwise might
        have been utter and enfeebling depression, the energies,
        the courage and the hope of his comrades and his
        followers.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>During thousands of years nature has developed in the human
    body many "safety first" signal systems. For example, when the
    body becomes chilled this signal system causes us to shiver and
    tickles the throat making us cough and in this way thru
    exercise stimulates the blood circulation.</p>

    <p>Perhaps in ages to come nature will find a way to tickle our
    sense of humor when we are angry, discouraged, or otherwise
    mentally discomfitted and will thus help us thru laughter to
    throw off the soul chill and to regain spiritual poise.</p>

    <h2>ABSENT-MINDEDNESS</h2>

    <p>This story is told of an absent-minded professor at Drew
    Theological Seminary. One evening while studying he had need of
    a book-mark. Seeing nothing else handy, he used his wife's
    scissors, which lay on the sewing-table. A few minutes later
    the wife wanted the scissors, but a diligent search failed to

    <p>The next day the professor appeared before his class and
    opened his book. There lay the scissors. He picked them up and,
    holding them above his head, shouted:</p>

    <p>"Here they are, dear!"</p>

    <p>Yes, the class got it.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Deep in a ponderous calculation, the professor leaned over
    his desk. One hand held his massive brow; the other guided the
    pencil.</p>

    <p>Suddenly the library door was flung open, and a nurse
    entered, smiling broadly.</p>

    <p>"There's a little stranger upstairs, professor," she
    announced, of course referring to the very latest arrival.</p>

    <p>"Eh?" grunted the man of learning, poring deeply over his
    problem.</p>

    <p>"It's a little boy," remarked the nurse, still smiling.</p>

    <p>"Little boy," mused the professor. "Little boy-eh? Well ask
    him what he wants."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A story is current concerning a professor who is reputed to
    be slightly absent-minded. The learned man had arranged to
    escort his wife one evening to the theater. "I don't like the
    tie you have on. I wish you would go up and put on another,"
    said his wife.</p>

    <p>The professor tranquilly obeyed. Moment after moment
    elapsed, until finally the impatient wife went upstairs to
    learn the cause of the delay. In his room she found her husband
    undressed and getting into bed.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"How will you have your roast beef?" asked the waiter.</p>

    <p>"Well done, good and faithful servant," murmured the
    clerical-looking diner absent-mindedly.</p>

    company with several salesmen, and was soon caught.</p>

    had regained his breath. "You have broken my window!"</p>

    <h2>ACCURACY</h2>

    <p>In one of the industrial towns in South Wales a workman met
    with a serious accident. The doctor was sent for, and came and
    examined him, had him bandaged and carried home on a stretcher,
    seemingly unconscious.</p>

    <p>After he was put to bed the doctor told his wife to give him
    sixpennyworth of brandy when he came to himself. After the
    doctor had left the wife told the daughter to run and fetch
    threepennyworth of brandy for her father.</p>

    <p>The old chap opened his eyes and said, in a loud voice:
    "Sixpenn'orth, the doctor said."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>An editor had a notice stuck up above his desk on which was
    printed: "Accuracy! Accuracy! Accuracy!" and this notice he
    always pointed out to the new reporters.</p>

    <p>One day the youngest member of the staff came in with his
    report of a public meeting. The editor read it through and came
    to the sentence: "Three thousand nine hundred ninety-nine eyes
    were fixed upon the speaker."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean by making a silly blunder like that?" he
    demanded, wrathfully.</p>

    <p>"But it's not a blunder," protested the youngster. "There
    was a one-eyed man in the audience!"</p><a name="H_0009"

    <p>"These love scenes are rotten. Can't the leading man act as

    <p>The teacher was giving the class a natural history lecture
    on Australia. "There is one animal," she said, "none of you
    have mentioned. It does not stand up on its legs all the time.
    It does not walk like other animals, but takes funny little
    skips. What is it?" And the class yelled with one voice,
    "Charlie Chaplin!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Eight-year-old Robert had been ill for nearly a month with
    tonsilitis, and nothing kept him contented but pictures of his
    favorite, Charlie Chaplin, clipped from the pages of the
    motion-picture pictorials.</p>

    <p>One morning, as his mother sat beside his bed, he studied
    earnestly a full-page drawing of the million-dollar
    comedian.</p>

    <p>"Mother," he asked, "will Charlie Chaplin go to heaven?"</p>

    <p>"Why, yes&mdash;I hope so," answered the somewhat astonished
    parent.</p>

    <p>"Gee! won't the Lord have some fun then!" was Robert's
    comment.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Sweeping his long hair back with an impressive gesture the
    visitor faced the proprietor of the film studio. "I would like
    to secure a place in your moving-picture company," he said.</p>

    <p>"You are an actor?" asked the film man.</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Had any experience acting without audiences?"</p>

    <p>A flicker of sadness shone in the visitor's eyes as he
    replied:</p>

    <p>"Acting without audiences is what brought me here!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>It was a death-bed scene, but the director was not satisfied
    with the hero's acting.</p>

    <p>"Come on!" he cried. "Put more life in your dying!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Pa, what's an actor?"</p>

    <p>"An actor, my boy, is a person who can walk to the side of a
    stage, peer into the wings at a group of other actors waiting
    for their cues, a number of bored stage hands and a lot of
    theatrical odds and ends and exclaim, 'What a lovely view there
    is from this window!'"</p>

    <p>"There were two actresses in an early play of mine," said an
    author, "both very beautiful; but the leading actress was thin.
    She quarreled one day at rehearsal with the other lady, and she
    ended the quarrel by saying, haughtily: 'Remember, please, that
    I am the star.'</p>

    <p>"'Yes, I know you're the star,' the other retorted, eyeing
    with an amused smile the leading actress's long, slim figure,
    'but you'd look better, my dear, if you were a little

    <p>Burton Holmes, the lecturer, had an interesting experience,
    while in London. He told some Washington friends a day or two
    ago that when he visited the theater where he was to deliver
    his travelogue he decided that the entrance to the theater was
    rather dingy and that there should be more display of his
    attraction.</p>

    <p>Accordingly, he suggested to the manager of the house that
    the front be brightened up at night by electrical signs, one
    row of lights spelling his name "Burton" and another row of
    lights spelling the name "Holmes."</p>

    <p>The manager told him it was too much of an innovation for
    him to authorize and referred him to the owner of the theater.
    Mr. Holmes traveled several hours into the country to consult
    with the owner, who referred him to his agent in the city. The
    agent in turn sent Mr. Holmes to the janitor of the
    theater.</p>

    <p>"I talked with the janitor and explained my plan to him for
    about an hour," Mr. Holmes said. "Finally, after we had gone
    into every detail of the cost and everything else, the janitor
    told me that the theater was a very exclusive and high class
    theater, and that he would not put up the sign. I asked him
    why?"</p>

    <p>"Because it would attract too much attention to the
    theater," the janitor replied.</p>

    <p>"What's your time?" asked the old farmer of the brisk

    the window and pointing to a ticket marked, "Given away at

            <p>To-day I bought an alarm-clock,</p>

    <p>A Swede was working for a farmer, who demanded punctuality
    above everything else. The farmer told him that he must be at
    work every morning at 4 o'clock sharp. The "hand" failed to get
    up in time, and the farmer threatened to discharge him. Then
    the "hand" bought an alarm-clock, and for some time everything
    went along smoothly. But one morning he got to the field
    fifteen minutes late. The farmer immediately discharged him, in
    spite of his protestations that his alarm-clock was to
    blame.</p>

    <p>Sadly returning to his room, the discharged employee
    determined to find out the cause of his downfall. He took the
    alarm-clock to pieces, and discovered a dead cockroach among
    the works.</p>

    <p>"Well," he soliloquized, "Ay tank it bane no wonder the
    clock wouldn't run&mdash;the engineer bane daid."</p>

    the man behind the counter; "we keep just the ordinary

    <p>Every normal man has two great ambitions. First, to own his
    home. Second, to own a car to get away from his home.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Ambition makes the same mistake concerning power that
    avarice makes concerning wealth. She begins by accumulating
    power as a means to happiness, and she finishes by continuing
    to accumulate it as an end.&mdash;<i>Colton</i>.</p>

    <h2>AMERICANS</h2>

    <p>A French magazine claims to have discovered in a New York
    paper an advertisement to this effect: "A gentleman who has
    lost his right leg is desirous of making the acquaintance of
    some one who has lost his left leg, in order to become
    associated with him in the purchase of boots and shoes, size
    8." The very observant French editor very politely comments:
    "An American may occasionally lose a leg, but he never loses
    his head."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"That's the Goddess of Liberty," explained the New Yorker.
    "Fine attitude, eh?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, and typically American," replied the Western visitor.

    <p>"William," asked the teacher of a rosy-faced lad, "can you

    <p>"Yes, ma'am," was the quick reply. "He was an American

    <p>"Quite right," replied the teacher. "And can you tell us
    what George Washington was remarkable for?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, ma'am," replied the little boy. "He was remarkable
    because he was an American and told the truth."</p>

    performance in the proper spirit. Instead of weeping, he
    laughed. While others were mopping their eyes and endeavoring
    to stifle their sobs, his face beamed with merriment and he
    burst into inappropriate guffaws.</p>

    <p>At last a lady by his side turned upon him indignantly.</p>

    <p>"I d-don't know what brought y-you here," she sobbed, with
    streaming eyes, and pressing her hand against her aching heart;
    "but if y-you don't like the p-play you might l-let other

    <p>The administrator who went to divide the property drove a

    unhitched one of his own, putting it with the other seventeen,
    making eighteen, when he proceeded to divide as follows:
    One-half, or nine to the eldest, one third, or six, to the next

    <p>One of those country gentlemen who owns a farm in Brown

    on the farm, asked one of his neighbors down in Brown county:
    "Did you know that T. C. Steele sold the picture that he
    painted on your farm?" The farmer made no reply to this, and
    then the country gentleman told him the price Mr. Steele got
    for the canvas. "I just wish I had known the feller liked the

    <p>Kate Douglas Wiggin's choicest possession, she says, is a
    letter which she once received from the superintendent of a
    home for the feeble-minded. He spoke in glowing terms of the
    pleasure with which the "inmates" had read her little book,
    "Marm Lisa," and ended thus superbly:</p>

    <p>The late Ambassador Walter Hines Page was formerly editor of
    The World's Work and, like all editors, was obliged to refuse a

    <p>"<i>Sir</i>: you sent back last week a story of mine. I know
    that you did not read the story, for as a test I had pasted
    together pages 18, 19, and 20, and the story came back with
    these pages still pasted; and so I know you are a fraud and
    turn down stories without reading same."</p>

    <p>BILL&mdash;"Just happened to run into an old friend
    down-town."</p>

    <p>PHIL&mdash;"Was he glad to see you?"</p>

    <p>BILL&mdash;"You bet not. I smashed his whole right

    <p>"My brother bought a motor here last week," said an angry
    man to the salesman that stepped up to greet him, "and he said
    if anything broke you would supply him with new parts."</p>

    <p>"Certainly," said the salesman. "What does he want?"</p>

    <p>"He wants two deltoid muscles, a couple of kneecaps, one
    elbow, and about half a yard of cuticle," said the man, "and he
    wants them at once."</p>

    <p>An elderly lady of very prim and severe aspect was seated
    next a young couple, who were discussing the merits of their
    motor-cars.</p>

    <p>"What color is your body?" asked the young man of the girl
    at his side, meaning of course, the body of her motor.</p>

    <p>"Oh, mine is pink. What is yours?"</p>

    <p>"Mine," replied the man, "is brown with wide yellow
    stripes."</p>

    <p>This was too much for the old lady. Rising from the table,
    she exclaimed:</p>

    <p>"When young people come to asking each other the color of
    their bodies at a dinner-party, it is time I left the
    room."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Why didn't you stop when I signaled you?" inquired the
    officer.</p>

    <p>"Well," replied Mr. Chuggins, "it had taken me two hours to
    get this old flivver started, and it seemed a shame to stop her
    merely to avoid a little thing like being arrested."</p>

    <h2>BANKS AND BANKING</h2>

    <p>Before the passage of the present strict banking laws in
    Wisconsin, starting a bank was a comparatively simple
    proposition. The surprizingly small amount of capital needed is
    well illustrated by the story a prosperous country-town banker
    told on himself, when asked how he happened to enter the
    banking business:</p>

    <p>"Well," he said, "I didn't have much else to do, so I rented
    an empty store building and painted BANK on the window. The
    first day I was open for business a man came in and deposited a
    hundred dollars with me; the second day another man dropped in
    and deposited two hundred and fifty; and so, by George, along
    about the third day I got confidence enough in the bank to put
    in a hundred myself!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A negro bank was opened in a small town in Georgia, and Sam
    deposited ten dollars. Several weeks later he returned to draw
    out his money. When he presented his check the colored cashier
    looked at it doubtfully and said: "Sam, you ain't got any money
    in dis here bank, but I'll look on de books an' make sure." In
    a minute he came back and said: "Yes, you did have ten dollars;
    but, nigger, de interes' done eat up dat money."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Father," said Nellie, "that bank in which you told me to
    put my money is in a bad way."</p>

    <p>"In a bad way?" returned her father. "Why, my child, that's
    one of the strongest banks in the country. What in the world
    gives you that idea?"</p>

    <p>"Well," said Nellie, "it returned one of my checks today for
    $30 marked 'No funds.'"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A Buffalo man stopped a newsboy in New York saying: "See
    here, son, I want to find the Blank National Bank. I'll give
    you half a dollar if you direct me to it."</p>

    <p>With a grin, the boy replied: "All right, come along," and
    he led the man to a building a half-block away.</p>

    <p>The man paid the promised fee, remarking, however, "That was
    a half-dollar easily earned."</p>

    <p>"Sure!" responded the lad. "But you mustn't fergit that
    bank-directors is paid high in Noo Yawk."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>HE&mdash;"We'll have to give up our intended summer trip. My
    account at the bank is already overdrawn."</p>

    <p>SHE&mdash;"Oh, John, you are such a wretched financier. Why
    don't you keep your account in a bank that has plenty of
    money?"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A Hebrew by the name of Cohen went into a bank one day and
    asked the cashier to discount his note. The bank cashier
    said:</p>

    <p>"Mr. Cohen, I can't discount that note unless you get some
    one you know, a responsible man, to indorse it."</p>

    <p>Cohen said to the cashier: "You know me, und you're
    responsible; you indorse it."</p><a name="H_0044"

    <h2>BAPTISM</h2>

    <p>"You don't know me, do you, Bobby?" asked a lady who had

    swimming with the preacher last Sunday."</p>

    <p>Little Edward's twin sisters were being christened. All went
    well until Edward saw the water in the font. Then he anxiously
    turned to his mother and exclaimed: "Ma, which one are you
    going to keep?"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Throughout the christening ceremony the baby smiled up
    beautifully into the clergyman's face.</p>

    <p>"Well, madam," said he to the young wife, "I must
    congratulate you on your little one's behavior. I have
    christened more than 2,000 babies, but I never before
    christened one that behaved so well as yours."</p>

    <p>The young mother smiled demurely, and said:</p>

    <p>"His father and I, with a pail of water, have been
    practising on him for the last ten days."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Tommy," said the Sunday-school teacher, who had been giving
    a lesson on the baptismal covenant, "can you tell me the two
    things necessary to baptism?"</p>

    <p>"Yes'm," said Tommy, "water and a baby."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In a small country church, not long since a little child was
    brought forward for baptism. The young minister, taking the
    little one in his arms, spoke as follows:</p>

    <p>"Beloved hearers, no one can foretell the future of this
    little child. He may grow up to be a great astronomer, like Sir
    Isaac Newton, or a great labor leader like John Burns; and it
    is possible he might become the prime minister of England."</p>

    <p>Turning to the mother, he inquired, "What is the name of the
    child?"</p>

    <p>"Mary Ann," was the reply.</p><a name="H_0045"

    <p>A thin, anemic woman was accosted by her friend on the
    street: "Why, Mary, how pale and thin you look! I thought you
    were going south for your health."</p>

    <p>"I was," said Mary, "but my doctor has offered me such a
    lovely bargain in operations&mdash;a major operation for one
    thousand dollars&mdash;and of course I can't resist that."</p>

    <p>"How much vas dose collars?"</p>

    <p>"Two for a quarter."</p>

    <p>"How much for vun?"</p>

    <p>"Fifteen cents."</p>

    <p>"Giff me de odder vun."</p>

    <p>"Ikey," said the teacher, "can you give me a definition for
    'a bargain'?"</p>

    <p>"Sure I can," smiled Ikey. "A bargain's when you get the
    best of them."</p>

    <p>Dad was not greatly pleased by the school report brought to
    him by his hopeful.</p>

    <p>"How is it?" he demanded, "that you stand so much lower in

    shilling."</p>

    <p>"Will ye, now?" said Pat.</p>

    <p>"Yes," he replied.</p>

    <p>The Irishman handed over the shilling, and his friend put
    eight pence into his palm in return.</p>

    <p>"Eight in pence," he explained. "Not bad, is it?"</p>

    <h2>BASEBALL</h2>

    <p>"Baseball," says a Big League magnate, "is the public's
    luxury." The small boy will disagree with him, a luxury being
    something you can do without.-Puck.</p>

    <p>At a ball game between a South Carolina negro team and a
    visiting team of similar color a negro preacher was acting as
    umpire. The pitcher had gone rather wild, and had permitted all
    the bases to fill. Another man came to the bat, and the nervous
    pitcher shot one over.</p>

    <p>"Ball one," yelled the ump.</p>

    <p>The pitcher tried again.</p>

    <p>"Ball two," was the decision.</p>

    <p>Another effort by the hurler.</p>

    <p>"Ball three," said the umpire.</p>

    <p>The pitcher saw his predicament, and made one master effort
    to save the day.</p>

    <p>"Ball four," yelled the ump, "and the man's out."</p>

    <p>"How come, I'se out?" inquired the enraged batter.</p>

    <p>"I'se repelled to put you out, nigger. Don't you see dar's
    nowhere else to put you?" reasoned the umpire.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>They were getting up a ball game in a small town and lacked
    one player. They finally persuaded an old fellow to fill in,
    although he said he had never played before. He went to the bat
    and the first ball pitched he knocked over the fence. Every one
    stood and watched the ball, even the batter. Excitedly they
    told him to run. "Shucks!" he said, "what's the use of running,
    I'll buy you another ball."</p>

    <p>An Englishman was seeing his first game of baseball, and the
    "fan" was explaining the different plays as they were being
    made.</p>

    <p>"Don't you think it's great?" enthusiastically asked the
    "fan."</p>

    <p>"Well," replied the Englishman, "I think it's very exciting,
    but also a very dangerous game."</p>

    <p>"Dangerous nothing," replied the fan.</p>

    <p>Just then a runner was put out at second base.</p>

    <p>"What has happened now?" asked the Englishman.</p>

    <p>"Chick Smith has died at second," laconically replied the
    fan.</p>

    <p>"Died at second?" replied the astonished Briton. "I knew it
    was a dangerous game."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>They arrived at the fifth inning.</p>

    <p>"What's the score, Jim?" he asked a fan.</p>

    <p>"There's a story connected with this diamond," said Heinie,
    pointing to a big, handsome stone which sparkled in his shirt
    front. "A friend of mine by the name of Meyer lay sick in bed.
    I being his best friend, he sent for me and said:</p>

    <p>"'Heinie, I'm a very sick man. I ain't got long to live. I'm
    worth a lot of money, and I'm going to leave it all to you and
    my other friends. But I want you to do me one favor. Take this
    money and when I'm dead and laid away buy me a nice stone.'</p>

    <p>"It is the duty of every man and woman to take an interest
    in politics."</p>

    <p>"Do you wish me to vote for the same candidate that you
    do?"</p>

    <p>"Why shouldn't you?"</p>

    <p>"I thought it might be a good idea for me to vote for the

    other of us has at last succeeded in picking a winner."</p>

    his first horse-race. He was feeling very reckless, and decided
    to risk one dollar, choosing a forty-to-one shot, as that
    looked like the largest percentage of gain. By a miracle his
    horse won, and upon handing his ticket to the bookmaker, he
    received forty dollars.</p>

    <p>"Now Johial took unto himself a wife of the daughters of
    Belial." (He turned a leaf.) "She was eighteen cubits in height
    and ten cubits in breadth." (A pause and careful scrutiny of
    the former page.)</p>

    <p>He resumed: "Now Johial took unto himself a wife," etc.
    (Leaf turned.) "She was eighteen cubits in height and ten
    cubits in breadth, and was pitched within and without&mdash;"

    <p>Bill Sprague kept a general store at Croyden Four Corners.
    One day he set off for New York to buy a lot of goods. The
    goods were shipped immediately; and as Bill had lingered in New
    York sightseeing, they reached Croyden Four Corners before him.
    The goods in an enormous packing-case were driven to the
    general store by the local teamster. Mrs. Sprague came out to
    see what had arrived and, with a shriek, tottered and fell.</p>

    <p>Ollie James is a big man personally and politically. He is a
    United States senator from Kentucky, and he weighs a trifle
    more than three hundred and fifty pounds.</p>

    <p>On one occasion, in traveling from New York to Washington,
    he barely caught the midnight train, and discovered that the
    only berth left was an upper. Having learned from experience
    that the process of coiling up his three hundred and fifty
    pounds and his six feet three inches in an upper berth was
    tough stuff, he was indignant. He was particularly enraged when
    he noticed that the lower directly under his berth was occupied
    by a small man who tipped the scales at not more than a hundred
    and twenty.</p>

    <p>Ollie grasped the curtains of the berth, shook them
    vigorously, growled once or twice, and remarked vindictively to
    the porter:</p>

    <p>"So I've got to sleep in an upper, have I? The last time I
    did that it was on a trip from Frankfort to Washington, and the

    attend to that corporation matter for you. Mr. J. had me on the

    <p>A dressy lady asked one of the assistants for an up-to-date
    story such as "Women men love" or the "Adventures of Anne." The
    assistant selected a story which she thought this type of
    reader would appreciate. After a few minutes the dressy lady
    again appeared with the book open, and pointing to a quotation
    on the title page said "I would like this book or any other by
    Proverbs." The astonished assistant read the quotation which
    was, "who can find a virtuous woman, her price is far above
    rubies." <i>Proverbs</i> 31:10.</p>

    read. As we stood talking the little chap ran joyfully toward
    her waving a picture book that had been made at the branch and
    said, "No words Mother, no words."</p>

    <h2>BOOKSELLERS AND BOOKSELLING</h2>

    <p>William Dean Howells, at a dinner in Boston, said of modern
    American letters:</p>

    <p>"The average popular novel shows on the novelist's part an
    ignorance of his trade which reminds me of a New England
    clerk.</p>

    <p>"In a New England village I entered the main street
    department-store one afternoon and said to the clerk at the
    book-counter:</p>

    <p>"'Let me have, please, the letters of Charles Lamb.'</p>

    <p>"'Post-office right across the street, Mr. Lamb,' said the
    clerk, with a naive, brisk smile."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"You never can tell," said a traveling salesman. "Now you'd
    think that a little New England village, chock full of church
    influence and higher education, would be just the place to sell
    a book like 'David Harum,' wouldn't you? Well, I know a man who
    took a stock up there and couldn't unload one of 'em. He'd have
    been stuck for fair if he hadn't had a brilliant idea and got
    the town printer to doctor up the title for him. As it was, he
    managed to unload the whole lot and get out of town before the
    first purchaser discovered that 'David's Harum' wasn't quite
    what he had led himself to suppose."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Remember what Roger Mifflin says: "When you sell a man a
    book, you don't sell him just three ounces of paper and ink and
    glue&mdash;you sell him a whole new life. Love and friendship
    and humour, and ships at sea by night&mdash;there's all heaven

    didn't think his father would like his playing with so many
    "common boys."</p>

    <p>"My father says there are no common boys," replied the young
    Roosevelt.</p>

    <p>"He says there are only tall boys and short boys, and good
    boys and bad boys, and that's all the kinds of boys there
    are."</p>

    <p>Johnny stood beside his mother as she made her selection
    from the green grocer's cart, and the latter told the boy to
    take a handful of nuts, but the child shook his head.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter, don't you like nuts?" asked the green
    grocer.</p>

    <p>"Yes," replied Johnny.</p>

    <p>"Then go ahead and take some."</p>

    <p>Johnny hesitated, whereupon the green grocer put a generous
    handful in Johnny's cap.</p>

    <p>After the man had driven on the mother asked: "Why didn't
    you take the nuts when he told you to?"</p>

    <p>Johnny winked as he said: "'Cause his hand was bigger'n

    <p>The vicar's appeal had been a most eloquent one, and had

    from the bottom of my heart. I thank you! May your business

    <h2>BUSINESS ENTERPRISE</h2>

    <p>The story of the rival boot-makers, which appeared recently,
    is matched by a correspondent of an English paper with another
    story, equally old but equally worth repeating. It concerns two
    rival sausage-makers. Again, they lived on opposite sides of a
    certain street, and, one day, one of them placed over his shop
    the legend:</p>

    <p>"We sell sausages to the gentry and nobility of the
    country."</p>

    <p>The next day, over the way, appeared the sign:</p>

    <p>"We sell sausages to the gentry and nobility of the whole
    country."</p>

    <p>Not to be outdone, the rival put up what he evidently
    regarded as a final statement, namely:</p>

    <p>"We sell sausages to the King."</p>

    <p>Next day there appeared over the door of the first
    sausage-maker the simple expression of loyalty:</p>

    <p>"God save the King."</p>

    <p>"Biddy," remarked the newly wed Irishman, "go down and feed

    husband. "Haven't I just endowed you with all my worldly goods,
    and if you can not feed your own property, then it's ashamed of
    you I am."</p>

    <p>This was a new point of view, so off Biddy went.</p>

    <p>Presently she returned.</p>

    <p>"Have you fed the pigs, Biddy?" demanded her husband,
    sternly.</p>

    <p>"Faith, and I have not," she answered. "I have done a great
    deal better. As they were my property I have sold them, and
    shall not be bothered with them again."</p>

    <p>TOMMY&mdash;"It don't cry so very much&mdash;and, anyway, if

    you couldn't stand on them, guess you'd feel like crying

    <p>A little girl was entertaining the visitors while her mother
    added the finishing touches to her toilet. One of the ladies
    said with a significant look: "Not very p-r-e-t-t-y," spelling
    the last word.</p>

    <p>"No," said the child quickly; "but awful s-m-a-r-t."</p>

    <p>It was time for "baby girl" to be in bed, but no amount of
    coaxing could get her there. At last her father offered to lie
    on the bed till the "sandman" arrived. Off she went
    "pick-a-back," and the tired mother leaned back in her chair
    with a sigh of content, ready for a hard-earned rest.</p>

    <p>Ten minutes&mdash;twenty&mdash;half an hour, and she was
    wondering when her husband would be down, when all at once she
    heard a soft, stealthy pit-a-pat. Nearer came the steps, and
    then a little white-robed form, with a tiny finger on her lip,
    stood in the doorway.</p>

    <p>"Hush, hush, muvver," she said. "I'se got farver to
    sleep."</p>

    <p>Junior was in the habit of coming to the table with a dirty

    <p>One time his mother, nearly losing patience, said: "Junior,
    why do you persist in coming to the table without washing? You
    know I always send you away."</p>

    inquired of a small lad.</p>

    <p>"No, he can't talk, and there ain't no reason why he should

    <p>"I have been playing Postman," replied little Fred.</p>

    <p>"Postman?" exclaimed his mother. "How could you do that when
    you had no letters?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, but I had," replied Fred. "I was looking in your trunk
    up in your room and I found a packet of letters tied 'round

    <p>"Did what?" asked her mother.</p>

    <h2>CHOICES</h2>

    <p>The Czar was recently complimenting a soldier, and asked him
    if he would rather have 100 rubles or the Iron Cross.</p>

    <p>"Would your Majesty deign to tell me the value of the

    <p>"Oh, it is not worth much intrinsically, perhaps two
    rubles."</p>

    <p>"Then, your Majesty, I will take the cross and ninety-eight
    rubles."</p>

    <p>Mother asked "Why?" and Dorothy said:</p>

    <p>The girl answered nothing, but promptly pressed a button.
    The car jumped forward, and the literalist involuntarily took a
    seat on the floor.</p>

    <p>"There," said the girl apparently in complete good humor,
    quoting the barrister in a famous play, "you think you can, but
    you can't."</p>

    knew, and I had so many I saved it to give away. I suppose we
    all do those things."</p>

    Christmas I was so fond of it I could hardly bear to part with
    it. So I thank you most heartily for remembering me this

    your place&mdash;stationary, you know, while here we like to
    see a man rise.</p>

    <p>"The European idea is pretty well illustrated by the remarks
    of Muggins. Muggins on his return from the pub one Saturday
    night, said to his wife:</p>

    Sergeant Todd with his cork leg takes to carryin' a cane

    <p>General Sherman once stopped at a country home where a tin
    basin and roller-towel sufficed for the family's ablutions. For
    two mornings the small boy of the household watched in silence
    the visitor's toilet. When on the third day the tooth-brush,
    nail-file, whisk-broom, etc., had been duly used, he asked:
    "Say, mister, air you always that much trouble to
    you'se'f?"</p>

    <h2>CLERGY</h2>

    <p>Some time ago a dinner was given in New York at which a
    well-known actor, who is something of a freethinker along
    theological lines, sat at the guest-table. When the hour for
    starting the feast arrived the toastmaster, a very religious
    man, discovered that no minister of the Gospel was present, tho
    several had been invited. In this emergency he turned to the
    actor and asked him to say grace.</p>

    <p>The actor rose, bowed his head, and in the midst of a deep
    hush said fervently:</p>

    <p>"There being no clergyman present, let us thank God!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p><i>Horse-power Misrated</i></p>

    <p>The new minister drove his two-horse rig up to the mountain
    ranch of one of his congregation. There had been some
    difference of opinion as to his qualifications. At the gate he
    was met by a small boy of the family, who was evidently
    cogitating a matter of deep perplexity.</p>

    <p>"Be you our preacher?"</p>

    <p>"I am."</p>

    <p>The boy eyed first the preacher and then the horses, his
    brow puckered with growing perplexity.</p>

    <p>"That's queer," he drawled. "I hern Dad tell the neighbors
    you was a one-hoss preacher."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Ting-a-ling-a-ling!</p>

    <p>The Rev. George C. Abbitt took down the receiver and placed
    it to his ear.</p>

    <p>"Is that the Dickel Liquor Company?" a woman asked.</p>

    <p>Mr. Abbitt recognized the voice as that of one of his
    parishioners.</p>

    <p>"No," he replied in stern reproof; "it is your rector."</p>

    <p>Was there a dull thud?</p>

    <p>No.</p>

    <p>"Indeed," said the lady, quick as a flash, "and pray what
    are you doing there?"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>TEARFUL PARISHIONER (saying farewell to departing
    minister)&mdash;"I don't know what we will do when you are
    gone, Dr. Blank."</p>

    <p>MINISTER&mdash;"Oh, the church will soon get a better man
    than I am."</p>

    <p>TEARFUL PARISHIONER&mdash;"That's what they all say, but
    they keep getting worse and worse."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A clergyman was accustomed to use scientific terms which the
    people did not understand. A deputation waited on him with the
    request that in the future, whenever he used such terms, he
    would explain them.</p>

    <p>On the following Sunday he used the word "hyperbole," and
    added:</p>

    <p>"As agreed on, I beg to explain this word. Were I to say
    that at this moment the whole of my congregation are sound
    asleep, it would be hyperbole; but if I say that one-half are
    asleep, that is not hyperbole, but the truth."</p>

    <p>The next day the deputation again called to say that the
    minister need not explain technical terms; they'd learn their
    meaning from a dictionary.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A minister came to the Episcopal church, at Williamsport,
    Pa., to speak.</p>

    <p>"Do you wish to wear a surplice?" asked the rector.</p>

    <p>"Surplice!" cried the visitor. "Surplice! I am a Methodist.
    What do I know about surplices? All I know about is a
    deficit!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The Scotch minister rose and cleared his throat, but
    remained silent, while the congregation awaited the sermon in
    puzzled expectancy. At last he spoke:</p>

    <p>"There's a laddie awa' there in the gallery a-kissin' a
    lassie," he said. "When he's done ah'll begin."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A clergyman famous for his begging abilities was once
    catechizing a Sunday-school. When comparing himself as pastor
    of the church to a shepherd, and his congregation to the sheep,
    he put the following question to the children: "What does the
    shepherd do for the sheep?"</p>

    <p>To the confusion of the minister a small boy in the front
    row piped out: "Shears them!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A small town boasts a female preacher. One day when working
    in her study she heard a timid knock at her door. Answering the
    summons she found a bashful young German on the step.</p>

    <p>"Good-afternoon," the preacheress remarked. "What do you
    wish?"</p>

    <p>"Do der minister lif in dis house?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

    <p>"Yess? Veil, I vant to kit merriet."</p>

    <p>"All right; I can marry you."</p>

    <p>The lady's hair is beginning to silver and the German
    glanced at it. Then without comment he jammed his hat on his
    head and hurried down the walk.</p>

    <p>"Will you be back?" she called.</p>

    <p>"You gits no chance mit me," he answered. "I don't want you;
    I haf got me a girl alreaty."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A clergyman was spending the afternoon at a house in the
    English village where he had preached. After tea he was sitting
    in the garden with his hostess. Out rushed her little boy
    holding a rat above his head. "Don't be afraid, mother," he
    cried; "he's dead. We beat him and bashed him and thumped him
    until"&mdash;catching sight of the clergyman, he added, in a
    lowered voice&mdash;"until God called him home."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Two Irish women in the market place of Cork were talking of
    the new curate.</p>

    <p>"Arrah, Biddy," said one, "did ye hear him last Sunday when
    he preached on 'Hell'?"</p>

    <p>"Faith an' I did that same, and shure he might have been
    born and reared there, so well did he know all about it."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>An Episcopal rector and a Roman Catholic priest had
    neighboring churches and didn't get along very well. After some
    time, however, they got together and decided to bury the
    hatchet.</p>

    <p>"For, after all," said he of the Episcopal faith, "we are
    both doing the Lord's work."</p>

    <p>"That is true," said the priest. "Let us therefore do his
    work to the best of our ability: you in your way," concluded
    the priest, and then added with a twinkle, "and I in his!"</p>

    <h2>COMPETITION</h2>

    <p>The clergyman's eloquence may have been at fault, still he
    felt annoyed to find that an old gentleman fell asleep during
    the sermon on two consecutive Sundays. So, after service on the
    second week, he told the boy who accompanied the sleeper that
    he wished to speak to him in the vestry.</p>

    <p>"My boy," said the minister, when they were closeted
    together, "who is that elderly gentleman you attend church
    with?"</p>

    <p>"Grandpa," was the reply.</p>

    <p>"Well," said the clergyman, "if you will only keep him awake
    during my sermon, I'll give you a nickel each week."</p>

    <p>The boy fell in with the arrangement, and for the next two
    weeks the old gentleman listened attentively to the sermon. The
    third week, however, found him soundly asleep.</p>

    <p>The vexed clergyman sent for the boy and said: "I am very
    angry with you. Your grandpa was asleep again today. Didn't I
    promise you a nickel a week to keep him awake?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," replied the boy, "but grandpa now gives me a dime not
    to disturb him."</p>

    <h2>CONTRIBUTION BOX</h2>

    <p>"I can na' get ower it," a Scottish farmer remarked to his
    wife. "I put a twa-shillin' piece in the plate at the kirk this
    morning instead o' ma usual penny."</p>

    <p>The beadle had noticed the mistake, and in silence he
    allowed the farmer to miss the plate for twenty-three
    consecutive Sundays.</p>

    <p>On the twenty-fourth Sunday the farmer again ignored the
    plate, but the old beadle stretched the ladle in front of him
    and, in a loud, tragic whisper, hoarsely said:</p>

    <p>"Your time's up noo, Sandy."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>An old colored minister announced that he had invented an
    automatic collection basket, which would be passed around by
    the deacons of his church. "It is so arranged, my brethren,"
    said he, "dat if you drop in a quatah or half dollah it falls
    noiselessly on a red plush cushion; if you drop a nickel it
    will ring a bell dat can be distinctly heard by de entiah
    congregation; but if you let fall a suspender button, my
    brethren, it will fiah off a pistol."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Father," said the minister's son, "my teacher says that
    'collect' and 'congregate' mean the same thing. Do they?"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps they do, my son," said the venerable clergyman;
    "but you may tell your teacher that there is a vast difference
    between a congregation and a collection."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"My sermon on thrift made a tremendous impression on the
    congregation."</p>

    <p>"How do you know?"</p>

    <p>"I could tell when I counted the collection."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Rastus, how is it you have given up going to church?" asked
    Pastor Brown.</p>

    <p>"Well, sah," replied Rastus. "it's dis way. I likes to take
    an active part, an' I used to pass de collection-basket, but
    dey's give de job to Brothah Green, who jest returned from ovah
    thai-ah."</p>

    <p>A Scotch minister in need of funds thus conveyed his
    intentions to his congregation:</p>

    <p>"Weel, friends, the kirk is urgently in need of siller, and
    as we have failed to get money honestly we will have to see
    what a bazaar can do for us."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>It is said that the farthing was coined in response to a
    demand from Scotchmen for a satisfactory coin for the
    collection box. It's value is a fourth of a cent.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A minister was on his vacation in the country. A neighboring
    church heard of it and asked him to preach while their own
    pastor was away. He consented and, on the Sunday when he was to
    supply, he and his boy walked across the fields to the church.
    In the vestibule there was a box for voluntary contributions
    and the minister after feeling around in his pocket found fifty
    cents which he dropped in. After the sermon, the elders came up
    to express their appreciation for his fine sermon and then
    remembered they hadn't yet paid him. They generously decided to
    give him all the collection for that Sunday and on opening the
    contribution box they found exactly fifty cents. The minister
    accepted it and went on his way home. After walking some
    distance the boy noticed his father was very silent evidently
    pondering over something, so he said, "Father, how much did you
    get?"</p>

    <p>The father replied "Fifty cents, son."</p>

    <p>"Why father, that's just what you put in, wasn't it?" asked
    the boy.</p>

    <p>"Yes, son."</p>

    <p>Both walked along in silence for some distance further, then
    the boy spoke up and said: "Father, if you had put more in,
    you'd have got more out, wouldn't you?"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Tight, who had money to burn but was apparently afraid of
    fire, happened in a church one day when a collection was being
    taken for foreign missions. Eventually the collector reached
    Tight, but Tight didn't make any motions like producing
    beautiful coin.</p>

    <p>"Pardon me," said the collector, placing the box before
    Tight, "we are taking a collection for foreign missions.
    Wouldn't you like to add a little to the amount?"</p>

    <p>"No, sir!" was the decisive rejoinder of Tight. "I never
    give to foreign missions."</p>

    <p>"Then take a little out of the box," softly responded the
    collector. "The money is for the benefit of the heathen."</p>

    <p>A church in Kansas was raising funds for a new church and
    the minister was calling on members for subscriptions. One of
    the pillars of the church rose and said: "I subscribe five
    dollars." Just at that instant a piece of plaster fell on his
    head. Half stunned he mumbled "f-f-five hundred dollars" and
    the minister prayed "Oh Lord, hit him

    <p>"I except nobody," said he.</p>

    <p>"But you must!" screamed the host.</p>

    <p>"I won't!"</p>

    <p>"You must!"</p>

    <p>At length a petty magistrate took Foote before the mayor,
    who observed that it had been customary in that town for a
    great number of years always to "except the mayor," and
    accordingly fined him a shilling for not conforming to ancient
    custom. Upon this decision, Foote paid the shilling, at the
    same time observing that he thought the landlord the greatest
    fool in Christendom&mdash;except the mayor.</p>

    <h2>DACHSHUNDS</h2>

    <p>An Englishman sat at a New York boarding-house table. One of
    the boarders was telling a story in which a "dachshund"
    figured. She was unable for a moment to think of the word.</p>

    <p>"It was one of these&mdash;what do you call them?&mdash;one
    of these long German dogs."</p>

    <p>The Englishman dropped his fork: his face beamed.
    "Frankfurters!"</p><a name="H_0152"

    <h2>DAMAGES</h2>

    <p>The conversation turned to the subject of damage-suits, and
    this anecdote was recalled by Senator George Sutherland, of
    Utah.</p>

    <p>A man in a Western town was hurt in a railroad accident, and
    after being confined to his home for several weeks he appeared
    on the street walking with the aid of crutches.</p>

    <p>"Hello, old fellow," greeted an acquaintance, rushing up to
    shake his hand. "I am certainly glad to see you around
    again."</p>

    <p>"Thanks," responded the injured one. "I am glad to be around
    again."</p>

    <p>"I see you are hanging fast to your crutches," observed the
    acquaintance. "Can't you do without them?"</p>

    <p>"My doctor says I can," answered the injured party, "but my
    lawyer says I can't."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"I have come here," said the angry man to the superintendent
    of the street-car line, "to get justice; justice, sir.
    Yesterday, as my wife was getting off one of your cars, the
    conductor stept on her dress and tore a yard of frilling off
    the skirt."</p>

    <p>The superintendent remained cool.</p>

    <p>"Well, sir," he said, "I don't know that we are to blame for
    that. What do you expect us to do? Get her a new dress?"</p>

    <p>"No, sir. I do not intend to let you off so easily as that,"
    the other man replied gruffly. He brandished in his right hand
    a small piece of silk.</p>

    <p>"What I propose to have you do," he said, "is to match this
    silk."</p><a name="H_0153"

    <h2>DANCING</h2>

    <p>The minister was dining with the Fullers and he was
    denouncing the new styles in dancing. Turning to the daughter
    of the house, he asked sternly:</p>

    <p>"Do you yourself, Miss Fuller, think the girls who dance
    these dances are right?"</p>

    <p>"They must be," was the answer, "because I notice the girls
    who don't dance them are always left."</p><a name="H_0154"

    <h2>DAYLIGHT SAVING</h2>

    <p>"Is your husband in favor of daylight saving?"</p>

    <p>"I think so. He stays out so much at night that I think he'd
    really prefer not to use any daylight at all."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Young Hopeful, who lives in the suburbs, was very much
    interested in the adjustment of the time, and on the morning
    when the clocks had been set back an hour awoke his mother.</p>

    <p>"Mother, mother," he called from his little bed, "listen to
    Mrs. Jones' chickens! They must have forgotten to tell them to
    set their crow back."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Well, yes," admitted Gap Johnson, of Rumpus Ridge, Ark.,
    "I've heerd something or nuther about setting the clock
    for'ards or bac'ards for some reason. I don't prezisely know
    what. But it don't make no special difference at our house one
    way or tother for the clock runs about as it pleases till some
    of us sorter climb up and set it b'guess and b'gosh as you
    might say. And if we save or lose an hour or two what's the
    odds? We've got all the time there is anyway."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Geordie Ryton, the village cobbler, bought two clocks, one a
    grandfather's. He put it in a corner and placed a small nickel
    clock on the mantel-shelf. The grandfather's clock has not been
    altered to the Daylight Saving Bill's requirements. "Hoo is't,
    Geordie," asked a customer, "ye've altered the smaal clock and
    not the gran'faither's clock?"</p>

    <p>"Wey," replied Geordie, "they said the gran'faither's
    clock's been tellin' the truth for ower sixty year, an' Aa
    can't find it in me heart te make a liar ov it noo. But the
    little begger wes made in Jarmany, so it'll be aal reet, he's

    <hr />

    <p>"What is worrying you now?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, nothing much," replied the man who is perpetually
    pensive. "I am merely trying to figure out what has become of
    all the daylight I saved since we set the clocks forward."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Jonas," ordered the farmer, "all the clocks in the house
    have run down. Wish you'd hitch up and ride down to the
    junction and find out what time it is."</p>

    <p>"I ain't got a watch. Will you lend me one?"</p>

    cases he learned that in 17 per cent. of the operations for
    that disease the post-mortem examinations showed that the
    appendix was in perfect condition.</p>

    <p>"The whole subject," he adds, "reminds me of a true story I
    heard in London recently. In the hospitals there, the ailment
    of the patient, when he is admitted, is denoted by certain
    letters, such as 'T. B.' for tuberculosis. An American doctor
    was examining these history slips when his curiosity was
    aroused by the number on which the letters 'G.O.K.' appeared.

    <p>"'There seems to be a severe epidemic of this G.O.K. in
    London. What is it, anyhow?'</p>

    <p>"Oh, that means 'God only knows,'" replied the English

    happened to be in a reminiscent mood, "I wanted to be a
    soldier; but my parents persuaded me to study medicine."</p>

    <p>"Oh, well," rejoined the sympathetic druggist, "such is

    himself with a retail business."</p>

    <p>The eminent physicians had been called in consultation. They
    had retired to another room to discuss the patient's condition.
    In the closet of that room a small boy had been concealed by
    the patient's directions to listen to what the consultation
    decided and to tell the patient who desired genuine
    information.</p>

    <p>"Well, Jimmy," said the patient, when the boy came to
    report, "what did they say?"</p>

    <p>"I couldn't tell you that," said the boy. "I listened as
    hard as I could, but they used such big words I couldn't

    <p>"I don't believe in operations!" she exclaimed. "Even the
    Scriptures is agin it. Don't the Bible say plain and flat:
    'What God hath j'ined togither, let not man put asunder'?"</p>

    <p>REDD&mdash;"The doctor said he'd have me on my feet in a
    fortnight."</p>

    <p>GREENE&mdash;"And did he?"</p>

    <p>"Sure. I've had to sell my automobile."</p>

    <p>SPECIALIST&mdash;"You are suffering from nerve exhaustion. I
    can cure you for the small sum of $2,000."</p>

    <p>PATIENT&mdash;"And will my nerve be as good as yours
    then?"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In a confidential little talk to a group of medical students
    an eminent physician took up the extremely important matter of
    correct diagnosis of the maximum fee.</p>

    <p>"The best rewards," he said, "come, of course, to the
    established specialist. For instance, I charge twenty-five
    dollars a call at the residence, ten dollars for an office
    consultation, and five dollars for a telephone
    consultation."</p>

    <p>There was an appreciative and envious silence, and then a
    voice from the back of the theater, slightly thickened,
    spoke:</p>

    <p>"Doc," it asked, "how much do you charge a fellow for
    passing you on the street?"</p>

    <p>An insurance agent was filling out an application blank.</p>

    <p>"Have you ever had appendicitis?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"Well," answered the applicant, "I was operated on but I
    have never felt quite sure whether it was appendicitis or
    professional curiosity."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Oh, doctor, I have sent for you, certainly; still, I must
    confess that I have not the slightest faith in modern medical
    science."</p>

    <p>"Well," said the doctor, "that doesn't matter in the least.
    You see, a mule has no faith in the veterinary surgeon, and yet
    he cures him all the same."</p>
    <hr />

    <p class="ctr"><i>A Great Difference</i></p>

    <p>A noted physician, particularly expeditious in examining and
    prescribing for his patients, was sought out by an army man
    whom he "polished off" in almost less than no time. As the
    patient was leaving, he shook hands heartily with the doctor
    and said:</p>

    <p>"I am especially glad to have met you, as I have often heard
    my father, Colonel Blank, speak of you."</p>

    <p>"What!" exclaimed the physician, "are you old Tom's
    son?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly."</p>

    <p>"My dear fellow," cried the doctor, "fling that infernal
    prescription in the fire and sit down and tell me what is the
    matter with you."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Father, what is a convalescent?"</p>

    <p>"A patient who is still alive, son."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Young M.D.&mdash;"Well, Dad, I'm hanging out my shingle;
    can't you give me some rules for success?"</p>

    <p>"Always write your prescriptions illegibly and your bills
    very plainly."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>MOTHER (after visitor had gone)&mdash;"Bobby, what on earth
    made you stick out your tongue at our pastor? Oh, dear!..."</p>

    <p>BOBBY&mdash;"Why, muvver, I just showed it to him. He said,
    'Littul man, how do you feel?'&mdash;and I thort he was a
    doctor!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>An Irishman coming out of ether in the ward after an
    operation, exclaimed audibly: "Thank God! That's over!" "Don't
    be too sure," said the man in the next bed, "they left a sponge
    in me and had to cut me open again." And the patient on the
    other side said, "Why they had to open me, too, to find one of
    their instruments." Just then the surgeon who had operated on
    the Irishman, stuck his head in the door and yelled, "Has
    anybody seen my hat!" Pat fainted.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Dr. A., physician at Newcastle, being summoned to a vestry,
    in order to reprimand the sexton for drunkenness, dwelt so long
    on the sexton's misconduct as to draw from him this expression:
    "Sir, I thought you would have been the last man alive to
    appear against me, as I have covered so many blunders of
    yours!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>DOCTOR (to patient)&mdash;"You've had a pretty close call.
    It's only your strong constitution that pulled you
    through."</p>

    <p>PATIENT&mdash;"Well, doctor, remember that when you make out
    your bill."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A quack doctor was holding forth about his "medicines" to a
    rural audience.</p>

    <p>"Yes, gentlemen," he said, "I have sold these pills for over
    twenty-five years and never heard a word of complaint. Now,
    what does that prove?"</p>

    <p>From a voice in the crowd came: "That dead men tell no
    tales."</p>

    swift and hideous death on the turnpike road the boy's mother

    <p>He took it very quietly. All day it was the same. But five

    paper."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The editor of the newspaper in a certain small southern town
    was given an article to print, praising in very elegant
    language the life and works of a certain southern colonel.</p>

    <p>The colonel and the editor were not the best of friends.</p>

    <p>The article came out, but in spelling "scarred," in that
    very important phrase "battle scarred veteran," one "r" was
    omitted.</p>

    <p>The colonel threatened violence but the editor promised to
    admit his error in the next issue.</p>

    <p>In the following issue, in large type, appeared: "The editor
    of this paper regrets very much an error in spelling in our
    last issue. In describing our most worthy colonel, instead of
    'battle scared veteran' it should read, 'bottle scarred
    veteran.'"</p>

    <p>That day the editor ceased to edit. His wife was a
    widow.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A country editor wrote: "Brother, don't stop your paper just
    because you don't agree with the editor. The last cabbage you
    sent us didn't agree with us either, but we didn't drop you
    from our subscription list on that account."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The girl reporter accepted the editor's invitation to dinner
    and when asked how she enjoyed it, said:</p>

    <p>"Oh, fine, but I'll never go to dinner with an editor
    again."</p>

    <p>You may know the trade classic about the exchange editor.
    The new owner of the newspaper asked who that man was in the

    day."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A little boy was given the stunt by his father to write an
    essay on editors and here is the result:</p>

    <p>"If an editor makes a mistake folks say he ought to be hung;
    but if a doctor makes a mistake he buries it and people dassent
    say nothing because doctors can read and write Latin. When the
    editor makes a mistake there is lawsuits and a big fuss; but if
    a doctor makes one there is a funeral, cut flowers and perfek
    silence. A doctor can use a word a yard long without anyone
    knowing what it means; but if the editor uses one he has to
    spell it. If the doctor goes to see another man's wife he
    charges for the visit but if the editor goes he gets a charge
    of buckshot. When the doctor gets drunk it's a case of being
    overcome by the heat and if he dies it's from heart trouble;
    when an editor gets drunk it's a case of too much booze and if
    he dies it's the jim-jams. Any college can make a doctor; an
    editor has to be born."</p>

    <p>Wanted, an editor, who can read, write and argue politics,
    and at the same time be religious, funny, scientific and
    historical at will, write to please everybody, know everything,

    say of everything and everybody else, live on wind and make
    more money than enemies. For such a man, a good opening will be

    great efficiency man in the office, but even more so at home.
    Why, every time Boggins Junior was naughty his father laid him

    <p>Efficiency is an admirable quality, but it can be overdone,

    Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p>"Last election day," Mr. Kelly explains, "the city editor of

    the saloons were open in defiance of the law. Four days later
    he returned and reported, 'They were.'"</p>

    <p>"Don't be so long-winded in your reports as you have been in
    the past," said the manager of the "Wild West" railway to his
    overseer. "Just report the condition of the track as ye find
    it, and don't put in a lot of needless words that ain't to the
    point. Write a business letter, not a love-letter."</p>

    <p>A few days later the railway line was badly flooded, and the
    overseer wrote his report to the manager in one line:
    "Sir&mdash;Where the railway was the river is.&mdash;Yours
    faithfully, &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

    <p>In Montana a railway-bridge had been destroyed by fire, and
    it was necessary to replace it. The bridge-engineer and his
    staff were ordered in haste to the place. Two days later came
    the superintendent of the division. Alighting from his private
    car, he encountered the old master bridge-builder.</p>

    <p>"Bill," said the superintendent&mdash;and the words quivered
    with energy&mdash;"I want this job rushed. Every hour's delay
    costs the company money. Have you got the engineer's plans for
    the new bridge?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know," said the bridge-builder, "whether the
    engineer has the picture drawed yet or not, but the bridge is
    up and the trains is passin' over
    it."&mdash;<i>Harper's</i>.</p>

    <h2>EMBARRASSING SITUATIONS</h2>

    <p>The wife of a Dorchester man who had the traditional
    failing&mdash;he forgot to mail letters&mdash;has cured him.
    The mail is delivered at their home before the breakfast
    hour&mdash;which is comparatively late. One morning she said to
    her husband:</p>

    <p>"Did you have any mail this morning, dear?"</p>

    <p>"Only a circular," he answered as he bit into a fine brown
    slice of toast.</p>

    <p>"Huh," said the wife. "By the way, did you mail the letters
    I gave you yesterday?"</p>

    <p>"Sure I did," was the righteously indignant reply.</p>

    <p>"Well," answered wifie, with an eloquent smile, "it's funny,
    then, you had no letters this morning, because one of those I
    gave you to mail was addressed to you&mdash;just as a sort of
    key."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Callers were at the door and Bobbie was told to show them
    into the parlor. He did so, and while his mother was fixing
    herself up, he sat there rather embarrassed. Presently, seeing
    the visitors glancing around the room, he said:</p>

    <p>"Well, what do you think of our stuff, anyway?"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Evelyn is very cowardly, and her father decided to have a
    serious talk with his little daughter.</p>

    <p>"Father," she said at the close of his lecture, "when you
    see a cow, ain't you 'fraid?"</p>

    <p>"No, certainly not, Evelyn."</p>

    <p>"When you see a bumblebee, ain't you 'fraid?"</p>

    <p>"No!" with scorn.</p>

    <p>"Ain't you 'fraid when it thunders?"</p>

    <p>"No," with laughter. "Oh, you silly, silly child!"</p>

    <p>"Papa," said Evelyn, solemnly, "ain't you 'fraid of nothing
    in the world but mama?"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Afraid to breathe, almost, the returned reveller crept
    quietly into his bedchamber as the gray dawn was breaking.
    Sitting on the edge of the bed, he cautiously undid his boots.
    But, with all his care, his wife stirred in bed, and he
    presently was all too well aware of a pair of sleepy eyes
    regarding him over the edge of the sheet.</p>

    <p>"Why, Tom," yawned the little woman, "how early you are this
    morning!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, my dear," replied Tom, stifling a groan, "I've got to
    go to Montreal for the firm today."</p>

    <p>And replacing his footgear the wretched man dragged his
    aching limbs out again into the cold and heartless streets.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A philanthropic New York woman was entertaining, in the
    spacious grounds of her suburban residence, a large number of
    East-Side children. On her rounds of hospitality she was
    impressed with one strikingly beautiful little girl. She could
    not have been more than nine years old, but her coal-black eyes
    flashed with intelligence. The hostess introduced herself and
    began a conversation.</p>

    <p>"Does what you see here today please you?" she asked. The
    child eyed her host in silence.</p>

    <p>"Talk away," said the lady. "Don't be afraid."</p>

    <p>"Tell me," then said the child, "how many children have you
    got?"</p>

    <p>Astonished at the question, the lady hesitated for a moment,
    and then entered into the fun of the situation.</p>

    <p>"Ten," she replied.</p>

    <p>"Dear me," answered the child, "that is a very large family,
    I hope you are careful and look after them. Do you keep them
    all clean?"</p>

    <p>"Well, I do my best."</p>

    <p>"And is your husband at work?"</p>

    <p>"My husband does not do any kind of work. He never has."</p>

    <p>"That is very dreadful," replied the little girl earnestly,
    "but I hope you keep out of debt."</p>

    <p>The game had gone too far for Lady Bountiful's enjoyment of
    it.</p>

    <p>"You are a very rude and impertinent child," she burst out,
    "to speak like that, and to me."</p>

    <p>The child became apologetic. "I'm sure I didn't mean to be,
    ma'am," she explained. "But mother told me before I came that I
    was to be sure to speak to you like a lady, and when any ladies
    call on us, they always ask us those questions."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A gentleman who had married his cook was giving a dinner
    party and between the courses the good lady sat with her hands
    spread on the tablecloth.</p>

    <p>Suddenly the burr of conversation ceased and in the silence
    that followed a young man on the right of his hostess said,
    pleasantly:</p>

    <p>"Awful pause!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, they may be," said the old-time cook, with heightened
    color; "and yours would be like them if you had done half my
    work."</p>

    <p>His relatives telephoned to the nearest florist's. The
    ribbon must be extra wide, with "Rest in Peace" on both sides,
    and if there was room, "We Shall Meet in Heaven."</p>

    <p>The florist was away and his new assistant handled the job.
    There was a sensation when the flowers turned up at the
    funeral. The ribbon was extra wide, indeed, and on it was the
    inscription:</p>

    <p>"Rest in peace on both sides, and, if there is room, we
    shall meet in heaven."</p>

    <h2>ENGLISH LANGUAGE</h2>

    <p>By way of enlarging the children's vocabulary, our village
    school-teacher is in the habit of giving them a certain word
    and asking them to form a sentence in which that word occurs.
    The other day she gave the class the word "notwithstanding."
    There was a pause, and then a bright-faced youngster held up
    his hand.</p>

    <p>"Well, what is your sentence, Tommy?" asked the teacher.</p>

    <p>"Father wore his trousers out, but notwithstanding."</p>

    <p>Charles B. Towns, the antidrug champion, spent some time in
    China several years ago with Samuel Merwin, the writer. In a
    Hongkong shop-window they noticed some Chinese house-coats of
    particularly striking designs and stepped in to purchase one.
    Mr. Towns asked Mr. Merwin to do the bargaining.</p>

    <p>"Wantum coatee," said Mr. Merwin to the sleepy-eyed Oriental
    who shuffled up with a grunt. He placed several of the coats
    before them.</p>

    <p>"My dear," said the uncle, "you must not say, 'I ain't

    give her a little lesson in grammar: "'You are not going. He is
    not going. We are not going. You are not going. They are not

    considered so clever. At the proper time he rose and said:</p>

    East Side subway. As she approached a team of horses standing
    by the curb, the nearer of the pair looked her straight in the
    eye man-to-man like. No driver being in sight she took from her
    pocket some lumps of sugar (reserved as a tip for the
    ice-horse) and fed and fondled and talked foolishly to her
    friend of the curb. Looking up before turning to the second
    horse, she was confused and startled to find a brisk young
    driver, reins in hand, looking ready to tear up the pavements
    in a mad rush to Jersey or somewhere. She hurried off to escape
    his wrath at being delayed. The angry words flung after her
    were: "The other one ain't no stepchild."</p>

    <h2>EVIDENCE</h2>

    <p>An attorney was defending a man charged by his wife with
    desertion. For a time it looked as tho it were a cinch for the
    prosecution, but at the psychological moment the attorney
    called the defendant to the stand. "Take off that bandage," he
    cried, and the man did it, exposing a black eye. "Your honor,"
    said the attorney, "our defense is that this man is not a
    deserter. He's a refugee."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The London police-sergeant raised his eyes from the blotter
    as two policemen propelled the resisting victim before him.</p>

    <p>"A German spy, sir!" gasped the first bobby.</p>

    <p>"I'm an American, and can prove it," denied the victim.</p>

    <p>"That's what he says, but here's the evidence," interrupted
    the second bobby, triumphantly producing a bulky hotel-register
    from beneath his arm, and pointing to an entry.</p>

    <p>"V. Gates," written in a flowing hand, was the record that
    met the astonished sergeant's gaze.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>It happened in the court-room during the trial of a husky
    young man who was charged with assault and battery. Throughout
    an especially severe cross-examination the defendant stoutly
    maintained that he had merely pushed the plaintiff "a little
    bit."</p>

    <p>"Well, about how hard?" queried the prosecutor.</p>

    <p>"Oh, just a little bit," responded the defendant.</p>

    <p>"Now," said the attorney, "for the benefit of the judge and
    the jury, you will please step down here and, with me for the
    subject, illustrate just how hard you mean."</p>

    <p>Owing to the unmerciful badgering which the witness had just
    been through, the prosecutor thought that the young man would
    perhaps overdo the matter to get back at him, and thus
    incriminate himself.</p>

    <p>The defendant descended as per schedule, and approached the
    waiting attorney. When he reached him the spectators were
    astonished to see him slap the lawyer in the face, kick him in
    the shins, seize him bodily, and, finally, with a supreme
    effort, lift him from the floor and hurl him prostrate across a
    table.</p>

    <p>Turning from the bewildered prosecutor, he faced the court
    and explained mildly:</p>

    <p>"Your honor and gentlemen, about one-tenth that hard!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>An aged negro was crossing-tender at a spot where an express
    train made quick work of a buggy and its occupants. Naturally
    he was the chief witness, and the entire case hinged upon the
    energy with which he had displayed his warning signal.</p>

    <p>A gruelling cross-examination left Rastus unshaken in this
    story: The night was dark, and he had waved his lantern
    frantically, but the driver of the carriage paid no attention
    to it.</p>

    <p>Later, the division superintendent called the flagman to his
    office to compliment him on the steadfastness with which he
    stuck to his story.</p>

    <p>"You did wonderfully, Rastus," he said. "I was afraid at
    first you might waver in your testimony."</p>

    <p>"Nossir, nossir," Rastus exclaimed, "but I done feared ev'ry
    minute that 'ere durn lawyer was gwine ter ask me if mah
    lantern was lit."&mdash;<i>Puck</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>During a suit to recover damages following an automobile
    collision in the Adirondacks, the complainant's attorney, a
    city lawyer, constantly hectored the defendant's principal
    witness, a rough old guide, but was unable to shake his
    testimony.</p>

    <p>During cross-examination the guide mentioned "havin' come
    across the trail of a Ford." The city lawyer jumped at this
    chance to discredit the guide's evidence.</p>

    <p>"Do you mean to tell this court," he demanded, "that you can
    determine the make of a car by studying its track? How did you
    know it was a Ford?"</p>

    <p>"Well, sir," drawled the guide, "I followed its trail about
    a hundred yards and found a Ford at the end of it."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The magistrate looked severely at the small, red-faced man
    who had been summoned before him, and who returned his gaze
    without flinching.</p>

    <p>"So you kicked your landlord downstairs?" queried the
    magistrate. "Did you imagine that was within the right of a
    tenant?"</p>

    <p>"I'll bring my lease in and show it to you," said the little
    man, growing redder, "and I'll wager you'll agree with me that
    anything they've forgotten to prohibit in that lease I had a
    right to do the very first chance I got."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"As a matter of fact," said the lawyer for the defendant,
    trying to be sarcastic, "you were scared half to death, and
    don't know whether it was a motor-car or something resembling a
    motor-car that hit you."</p>

    <p>"It resembled one all right," the plaintiff made answer. "I
    was forcibly struck by the resemblance."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A religious worker was visiting a Southern penitentiary,
    when one prisoner in some way took his fancy. This prisoner was
    a negro, who evinced a religious fervour as deep as it was
    gratifying to the caller.</p>

    <p>"Of what were you accused?" the prisoner was asked.</p>

    <p>"Dey says I took a watch," answered the negro. "I made a
    good fight. I had a dandy lawyer, an' he done prove an alibi
    wif ten witnesses. Den my lawyer he shore made a strong speech
    to de jury. But it wa'n't no use, sah; I gets ten years."</p>

    <p>"I don't see why you were not acquitted," said the religious
    worker.</p>

    <p>"Well, sah," explained the prisoner, "dere was shore one
    weak spot 'bout my defence&mdash;dey found de watch in my
    pocket."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Some time ago an elderly gentleman walking along the street
    saw a little girl crying bitterly. Instantly his heart softened
    and he stopped to soothe her.</p>

    <p>"What is the matter, little girl," he kindly asked; "are you
    hurt?"</p>

    <p>"No, sir," responded the child as her sobbing increased in
    volume, "I lost my nickel!"</p>

    <p>"There! There!" gently returned the kind-hearted citizen,
    digging into his pocket. "Don't cry any more. Here is your
    nickel."</p>

    <p>"Why, you wicked man!" exclaimed the little girl, seizing
    the coin and glaring at the donor with flashing eyes. "You had
    it all the time!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A witness in a railroad case at Fort Worth, asked to tell in
    his own way how the accident happened, said:</p>

    <p>"Well, Ole and I was walking down the track, and I heard a
    whistle, and I got off the track, and the train went by, and I
    got back on the track, and I didn't see Ole; but I walked
    along, and pretty soon I seen Ole's hat, and I walked on, and
    seen one of Ole's legs, and then I seen one of Ole's arms, and
    then another leg, and then over one side Ole's head, and I
    says, 'My God! Something muster happen to Ole!'"</p>

    <p>A man with a look of business on his face came to a

    <p>"Two carloads!" said the man in amazement. "Why, I could not

    <p>A certain young society man was much given to telling
    exaggerated stories and was rapidly gaining a reputation for
    untruthfulness which worried his friends and particularly his
    chum, who remonstrated with him and threatened to disown him if
    he did not mend his ways.</p>

    <p>"Charlie," said he, "you must stop this big story business
    of yours or you are going to lose me as a friend. Nobody
    believes a word you say, and you are getting to be a
    laughing-stock."</p>

    <p>Charlie admitted that he was aware of the fact but
    complained that he could not overcome his fault, try as he
    would. He suggested that had he but somebody beside him when he
    started to elaborate upon his tale, to tread on his foot, he
    was sure he could break the habit.</p>

    <p>A few days later they were invited to a dinner party and his
    chum agreed to sit next to Charlie and step on his toe if he
    went too far. All went well until the subject of travel was
    brought up. One of the company told of an immense building that
    he had seen when on a trip up the Nile. This started Charlie,
    who at once began to describe a remarkable building he had seen
    while on a hunting trip on the northern border of India.</p>

    <p>"It was one of the most remarkable buildings, I presume, in
    the world," said he. "Its dimensions we found to be three miles
    in length, two miles in height, and"&mdash;as his watchful
    friend trod on his toe&mdash;"two feet wide."</p>

    Washington has been found. He, in company with several others,
    had been granted four days' leave, and, as usual, wired for
    extension. But no hackneyed excuse was his. In fact, it was so

    to bring me an excuse from your father telling me why you were

    <p>In his Savannah camp Bill Donovan, baseball manager, had a
    dusky-hued waiter at the hotel by the name of Sutton. Bill had
    to reproach Sutton more than once for a lack of agility in
    arriving with the food. Sutton promised to improve. One morning
    he brought in a consignment of griddle-cakes that had gone
    cold.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean," said Bill, "by bringing me in cold
    cakes?"</p>

    <p>A country school-master had two pupils, to one of whom he
    was partial, and to the other severe. One morning it happened
    that these two boys were late, and were called up to account
    for it.</p>

    <p>"You must have heard the bell, boys; why did you not
    come?"</p>

    <p>"Please, sir," said the favorite, "I was dreaming that I was
    going to Margate, and I thought the school-bell was the
    steam-boat-bell."</p>

    <p>"Very well," said the master, glad of any pretext to excuse
    his favorite. "And now, sir," turning to the other, "What have
    you to say?"</p>

    <p>"Please, sir," said the puzzled boy, "I&mdash;I&mdash;was
    waiting to see Tom off!"</p>

    and a roll," said the first "commercial."</p>

    <p>"Bring me the same," said his friend, "but eliminate the
    eggs."</p>

    <p>"Yessir."</p>

    <p>In a moment the waiter came back, leaned confidentially and
    penitently over the table, and whispered:</p>

    Glancing through his pocket book his mother saw a number of
    entries of small sums, ranging from 2s. 6d. to 5s., against
    which were the letters "P.G." Thinking this must mean the
    Propagation of the Gospel, she asked her son why he did not
    give a lump sum and a larger amount to so deserving a
    cause.</p>

    <p>"That is not for the Propagation of the Gospel," he replied.
    "When I cannot remember exactly on what I spend the money I put
    'P.G.,' which means 'Probably grub.'"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Don't you find it hard these times to meet expenses?"</p>

    <p>"Have you ever had any experience in handling high-class
    ware?" asked a dealer in bric-&agrave;-brac of an applicant for
    work.</p>

    <p>"No, sir," was the reply, "but I think I can do it."</p>

    <p>"Suppose," said the dealer, "you accidentally broke a very
    valuable porcelain vase, what would you do?"</p>

    <p>"I should put it carefully together," replied the man, "and
    set it where a wealthy customer would be sure to knock it over
    again."</p>

    <p>"Consider yourself engaged," said the dealer. "Now, tell me
    where you learned that trick of the trade."</p>

    <p>"A few years ago," answered the other, "I was one of the
    'wealthy-customer' class."</p>

    it cost.</p>

    <p>A census-taker was working in lower New York on the East
    Side, and came to a tenement that was literally crowded with
    children. To the woman who was bending over the washtub he
    said:</p>

    <p>"Madam, I am the census-taker; how many children have
    you?"</p>

    <p>"Well, lemme see," replied the woman, as she straightened up
    and wiped her hands on her apron. "There's Mary and Ellen and
    Delia and Susie and Emma and Tommy and Albert and Eddie and

    <h2>FARMING</h2>

    <p>"It used to be said that anybody could farm&mdash;that about
    all that was required was a strong back and a weak mind," mused
    the gaunt Missourian. "But now'-days, to be a successful farmer
    a feller must have a good head and a wide education in order to
    understand the advice ladled out to him from all sides by city
    men and to select for use that which will do him the least
    damage."</p>

    <hr />

    <p>They were having an argument as to whether it was correct to
    say of a hen she is "setting" or "sitting," and, not being able
    to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, they decided to submit
    the problem to Farmer Giles.</p>

    <p>"My friends," said he, "that don't interest me at all. What
    I wants to know when I hear a hen cackle is whether she be
    laying or lying."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"How many head o' live stock you got on the place?"</p>

    <p>"Live stock?" echoed the somewhat puzzled farmer. "What d'
    ye mean by live stock? I got four steam-tractors and seven
    automobiles."&mdash;<i>Judge</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The city youth secured a job with Farmer Jones. The morning
    after his arrival, promptly at 4 o'clock, the farmer rapped on
    his door and told him to get up. The youth protested.</p>

    <p>"What for?" he asked, rubbing his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Why, we're going to cut oats," replied the farmer.</p>

    <p>"Are they wild oats," queried the youth, "that you've got to
    sneak up on 'em in the dark?"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Aren't you afraid America will become isolated?"</p>

    <p>"Not if us farmers keep raisin' things the world needs,"
    answered Farmer Corntossel, "The feller that rings the
    dinner-bell never runs much risk of bein' lonesome."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"How'd that city hired man of yours pan out?"</p>

    <p>"Well, he started in Monday morning plowing corn. At 10
    o'clock he struck for a helper to lift the gangs out at the
    ends, and I sent the kid out to do that. At noon he struck for
    two pieces of strawberry shortcake instead of one, so I gave
    him my piece. At 1:15 he struck for a sunshade on the corn
    plow. I says, 'Young man, this job is just like a baseball
    game. Three strikes and you're out, Good-bye.'"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A rather patronizing individual from town was observing with
    considerable interest the operations of a farmer with whom he
    had put up for a while.</p>

    <p>As he watched the old man sow the seed in his field the man
    from the city called out facetiously:</p>

    <p>"Well done, old chap. You sow; I reap the fruits."</p>

    <p>Whereupon the farmer grinned and replied:</p>

    <p>"Maybe you will. I am sowing hemp."</p>

    <p>A flivver in Newton, Kan., broke the arms of four persons
    who attempted to crank it in less than a week. That's what

    <hr />

    <p>Lew McCall says that motorists who come through Columbus en
    route for Kansas City have about the following conversations
    when they stop at the filling station here:</p>

    <p>If it's a Cadillac, the driver says: "How far is it to
    Kansas City?" "One hundred forty miles," is the reply. "Gimme
    twenty gallons of gas and a gallon of oil," says the driver.
    Then comes a Buick and the chauffeur says: "How far is it to
    Kansas City?" "One hundred forty miles." "Gimme ten gallons of
    gas and a half-gallon of oil." and he drives on. Along comes a
    flivver and the driver uncranks himself, gets out and
    stretches, and asks: "How far is it to Kansas City?" "Oh, about
    one hundred forty miles." "Is that all? Gimme two quarts of
    water and a bottle of 3 in 1, and hold this son-of-a-gun until
    I get in."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Possibly the apex of sarcasm or something was reached the
    other day when Jones took his flivver to a repair shop and
    asked the man there what was the best thing to do with it.</p>

    <p>The repair-man looked the car over in silence for several
    minutes, after which he grasped the horn and tooted it. "You've
    a good horn there," he remarked, quietly. "Suppose you jack it
    up and run a new car under it?"</p>

    <p>A Gentleman who was visiting his lawyer for the purpose of
    making his will, insisted that a final request be attached to

    this was, but failed, so he asked the gentleman's wife to use
    her influence with him. She did the best she could, but she
    also failed.</p>

    <p>"Well, John," she said finally, "tell me <i>why</i> you want
    your Ford car buried with you?"</p>

    <h2>FREEDOM OF SPEECH</h2>

    <p>Dean Jones of Yale is credited with this definition of
    freedom of speech: "The liberty to say what you think without
    thinking what you say."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"I believe in free speech!" exclaimed the vociferous
    man.</p>

    <p>"So do I," rejoined Uncle Bill Bottletop; "so do I. But in
    one respect free speech reminds me of the free lunch in the old
    days. You hate to see a man making a pig of himself just
    because something's free."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Words can be just as dangerous as acts. There is a common
    notion that the right of free speech implies the right to say
    anything we please and relieves a man of all responsibility for
    his words. Every man should recognize that hard words are just
    as dangerous as brickbats, and if he gets to throwing them
    around promiscuously he is liable for the damage he does.
    Almost any opinion we have could be stated in terms that would
    not cause offense. Hard words are caused by our consciousness
    of the weakness of our position. They are symptoms of
    impotence. They arise from the feeling that a single statement
    of our case is not sufficient, and that the only way to make an
    impression is by insult or abuse. A man who is satisfied with
    the justice of his position is content to state it in simple
    and inoffensive terms.&mdash;<i>Dr. Frank Crane</i>.</p>

    <p>"Sir," screeched the wild-haired man, "are you opposed to

    <p>A painter of the "impressionist" school is now confined in a
    lunatic asylum. To all persons who visit him he says, "Look
    here; this is the latest masterpiece of my composition." They
    look, and see nothing but an expanse of bare canvas. They ask,
    "What does that represent?"</p>

    <p>"That? Why, that represents the passage of the Jews through
    the Red Sea."</p>

    <p>When the captain of the fire department was about to resign,
    his men banded together and purchased an elaborate, embossed
    silver horn to present to him at a meeting in the town hall.
    The fireman who was chosen to make the presentation practiced
    his speech for days beforehand. The chief, who had been
    informed of what was to happen, also practiced his speech of
    acceptance. They rehearsed together and were "letter perfect"
    when they mounted the platform in the town hall. The throng
    which confronted them had, however, a disastrous effect.
    Holding the horn at arm's length, the fireman stalked across
    the platform and with a ghastly expression on his face,
    said:</p>

    <p>"Well, Bill, here's your horn!"</p>

    <p>Before becoming a hotel clerk he had worked in a grocery

    <p>"Is Judge David Poggenburg stopping here?" asked an
    impressive-looking stranger approaching the desk.</p>

    <p>"No," replied the clerk with his most winning manner,
    "but&mdash;er&mdash;we have something else just as good."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>He was engaged to the daughter of a literary man. He was
    bold as a wooer, but the veriest coward when it came to
    approaching the fair one's father. So he waited outside the
    great man's study while the "fayre ladye" did the tackling. In
    five minutes she was out again and on her dress was pinned a
    slip of paper bearing the words:</p>

    <p>"With the author's compliments."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"I took that pretty girl from the store home the other

    in that barber-shop over on Steenth Avenue and Umptyiph
    Street."</p>

    <p>And just then the noble warrior dashed madly past, and,
    forgetting himself under the excitement of the moment, turned
    and cried aloud to his advancing troops:</p>

    <p>"Next! Shine!"</p>

    <p>And the indomitable phalanx moved steadily up the hill,
    giving the enemy the worst polishing-off they had had since war

    <p>Happiness is not a fixed quantity, like the world's gold
    supply: so that the more one man has the less his neighbor is
    likely to have. Real happiness is an infection. You can never
    force it upon any one. Each individual must "take" it. I have
    heard people say, as explaining the misery of many, that there
    is not enough happiness to go around. But the comment misses
    the very nature of happiness. The more there is in the world,
    the more there is likely to be. The larger the number of happy
    people the faster the infection will spread. But each must
    invite it. One child is happy with the crudest sort of toy,
    whereas another child is unhappy with an armful of toys. To the
    latter kind of soul, grown or ungrown, you can never give
    happiness, for there are not enough toys to supply everybody.
    Happiness is of the heart not of circumstances.</p>

    <p>After reading a poem about a little boy who was so happy
    because there were lovely flowers, beautiful birds, blue sky

    <p>"It's no heavier to carry, it's just as good to eat, and it
    won't make everybody hate me!" quoth he.</p>

    <p>The good fairy laughed.</p>

    <p>The other day I met in the street a man in uniform. His coat

    stripes, insignia and chevrons of the most gorgeous colors and
    fantastic designs. My curiosity was too much for me, and I was
    about to stop and question him, when I discovered he had
    already halted and was bursting to tell me.</p>

    <p>"Yes," he announced, "they are every one authorized by the
    War Department. These three octangular triangles of orange mean
    my third cousin did a good deal of war work. These ten vertical
    mauve stripes are ten embarkations; the ten horizontal stripes
    denote ten times sea-sick."</p>

    with only a small gold chevron on each arm. My curiosity again
    overcame me. "My boy, how came you by those?" I asked, feeling
    assured he could not say much about only two chevrons. He did
    not.</p>

    <p>"Naw," was the blushing reply. "I'm only a common doughboy.

    <p>To the officer indicated went the reporter.</p>

    <p>"I'm told you're a hero, sir," he said.</p>

    <p>"No," laughed the lieutenant. "I merely happened to be on
    the job when something needed to be done, and I did it.
    However, I can refer you to the simon-pure article." And he
    pointed out a sergeant with three wound stripes upon his
    sleeve.</p>

    <p>"Not guilty," declared the sergeant, when questioned. Then,
    his eyes kindling with admiration, he waved toward a figure
    standing somewhat aside from the throng. "Talk to the major.
    You couldn't string on a fat man's bay window the medals he's

    <p>It is said that home is the place where a man hangs his hat,

    a strip of carpet that is faded, a few old family pictures, an
    old-fashioned vase, a meat platter, a cup and a few plates that
    do not match and are chipped around the edges. These, and a few

    <p>PUZZLED&mdash;Don't be bluffed. Simply put all extra leaves

    and throw it flat on its back. When you have it down brand it
    on first page with hot ink.</p>

    <p>C.H.&mdash;Yes, algebra may be used in figuring your return.
    Personally we employ trigonometry, altho many prefer calculus
    and a couple of lawyers.</p>

    <p>TAXPAYER&mdash;Your problem is as clear as a Chinese
    laundryticket. Simply deduct the net profit of losses (plus
    inventories at end of year) and add income from salaries,
    wages, bonuses, director's fees, and pensions. Nothing to
    it!</p>

    <p>J.J.C.&mdash;Refer to Table 113 on Page 11, Section 28, Part
    IV of return. Then if Item 86, Schedule V, line 7, exceeds the
    sum stated in Item 21, Page 9, Schedule Z, get another blank
    form.</p>

    <p>CONFUSED&mdash;No, you should have figured the amounts in
    Items 34, 60, and 69 as net losses from Wear and Tear,
    Obsolescense and Depletion Charged Off (see K (2) on Page 8 of
    Instructions) before entering total in Item 94, Schedule O.
    It's perfectly simple.</p>

    <h2>INDUSTRY</h2>

    <h2>INSURANCE, FIRE</h2>

    <p>THE MAN OF LAW&mdash;"But, my dear madam, there is no
    insurance money for you to draw. Your late husband never
    insured his life; he only had a policy against fire."</p>

    <p>THE WONDERFUL WIDOW&mdash;"Precisely. That is the very
    reason I had him cremated!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A woman, wearing an anxious expression, called at an
    insurance office one morning.</p>

    <p>"I understand," she said, "that for five dollars I can
    insure my house for a thousand dollars."</p>

    <p>"Yes," replied the agent, "that is right."</p>

    <p>"And," continued the woman anxiously, "do you make any
    inquiries as to the origin of the fire?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly," was the prompt reply.</p>

    <p>"Oh!" and she turned to leave the office, "I thought there
    was a catch in it somewhere."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"I say, Jones, I want to insure my coal-yards against fire.
    What would a policy for $20,000 cost?"</p>

    <p>"What coal is it? Same kind as you sent me last?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"I wouldn't bother insuring it if I were you. It won't
    burn."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>When the agent brought Mrs. Tarley her fire-insurance policy
    he remarked that it would be well for her to make her first
    payment at once.</p>

    <p>"How much will it be?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"About $100. Wait a minute and I'll find the exact
    amount."</p>

    long time on Mr. Snaggs' trail, "what is your objection to
    having your life insured?"</p>

    <p>"Well, I don't mind telling you," replied Snaggs. "The idea
    of being more valuable dead than alive is distasteful to
    me."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"What's the matter, old man? You look worried."</p>

    <p>"Well, to be honest with you, I am. You know, I took out
    some life insurance last Thursday."</p>

    <p>"Yes," replied the sympathetic friend, "but what has that to
    do with the wobegone expression on your face?"</p>

    <p>"Well, the very next day after I had it written my wife
    bought a new cook-book. Possibly it's all right, but it
    certainly looks suspicious."</p>

    <p>"How much life insurance do you think a man ought to

    <p>"Enough to keep his family from want, but not so much as to

    <p>Two insurance agents&mdash;a Yankee and an
    Englishman&mdash;were bragging about their rival methods. The
    Britisher was holding forth on the system of prompt payment
    carried out by his people&mdash;no trouble, no fuss, no attempt
    to wriggle out of settlement.</p>

    <p>"If the man died tonight," he continued, "his widow would
    receive her money by the first post tomorrow morning."</p>

    <p>"You don't say?" drawled the Yankee. "See here, now, you
    talk of prompt payment! Waal, our office is on the third floor
    of a building forty-nine stories high. One of our clients lived
    in that forty-ninth story, and he fell out of the window. We
    handed him his check as he passed."</p>

    <p>A colored recruit said he intended to take out the full
    limit of Government insurance, $10,000. On being told by a
    fellow soldier that he would be foolish to pay on so much when
    he was likely to be shot in the trenches, he replied: "Huh! I
    reckon I knows what I's doin.' You-all don't s'pose Uncle Sam
    is gwine to put a $10,000 man in the first-line trenches, do

    <h2>JURY</h2>

    <p>Fresh from Boston, the lawyer in the frontier town had just
    finished a glowing summing up for the defense. There ensued a
    long pause, and the Easterner turned in some embarrassment to
    the judge.</p>

    <p>"Your Honor," he asked, "will you charge the jury?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, no, I guess not," answered the judge benignantly.</p>

    <p>"They ain't got much anyway, so I let them keep all they can
    make on the side."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The jury filed into the jury-box, and after the twelve seats
    were filled there still remained one juror standing
    outside.</p>

    <p>"If the Court please," said the Clerk, "they have made a
    mistake and sent us thirteen jurors instead of twelve. What do
    you want to do with this extra one?"</p>

    <p>"What is your name?" asked the judge of the extra man.</p>

    <p>"Joseph A. Braines," he replied.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Clerk," said the judge, "take this man back to the jury
    commissioners and tell them we don't need him as we already
    have twelve men without Braines."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A suit for damages was being tried not long ago in one of
    the divisions of a Southern city court. A country lad,
    seventeen or eighteen years of age, was put on the stand to
    testify. He gave his testimony in so low a tone that the judge,
    pointing to the jury, said to him:</p>

    <p>"Speak so that these gentlemen can hear you."</p>

    <p>"Why," said the witness, with a beaming smile, "are these
    men interested in the case, too?"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Judge, Your Honor," cried the prisoner at the bar, "have I
    got to be tried by a lady jury?"</p>

    <p>"Be still!" whispered his attorney.</p>

    <p>"I won't be still! Judge, I can't even fool my own wife, let
    alone twelve strange women. I'm guilty!"</p>

    <p>In western Georgia a jury recently met to inquire into a
    case of suicide. After sitting through the evidence, the twelve
    men retired, and, after deliberating, returned with the
    following verdict:</p>

    <p>"The jury are all of one mind&mdash;temporarily insane."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>THE JUDGE (to jury, who have retired several times without
    agreeing)&mdash;"I understand that one juryman prevents your
    coming to a verdict. In my summing up I have clearly stated the
    law, and any juryman who obstinately sets his individual
    opinion against the remaining eleven is totally unfitted for
    his duties."</p>

    twelve men who sat all together, and then these twelve men were
    put in a dark room to be developed."</p>

    <p>During an address to a body of law students ex-President
    Taft pointed out that too much care cannot be taken in the
    selection of the jury. In this connection he told of an
    intelligent-looking farmer who had been examined by both
    defense and prosecution and was about to be accepted, when the
    prosecutor chanced to ask:</p>

    <p>"Do you believe in capital punishment?"</p>

    <p>The farmer hemmed and hawed and after a moment's reflection
    replied:</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir, I do, if it ain't too severe."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>THE COURT&mdash;"Considering that you are the wife of the
    prisoner, do you think you are qualified to act as a juror in
    this case?"</p>

    chance, I think I can convince the eleven other jurors that
    he's guilty."</p>

    <p>A tailor who had been wrongfully accused of murder, and who

    client's distress as he surveyed the jurymen.</p>

    <p>"It looks very bad for me," said the defendant, "unless some
    steps are taken to dismiss that jury and get in a new lot.

    <p>The Red-Cross idea that children should be encouraged to

    they so endeared themselves to the children, can only be

    <p>"Can you tell me," said the Court, addressing Enrico Ufuzzi,
    under examination at Union Hill, N.J., as to his qualifications
    for citizenship, "the difference between the powers and
    prerogatives of the King of England and those of the President
    of the United States?"</p>

    <p>In the English royal library at Windsor, in the center of
    the magazine table, there is a large album of pictures of many
    eminent and popular men and women of the day. This book is
    divided into sections&mdash;a section for each calling or
    profession. Some years ago Prince Edward, in looking through
    the book, came across the pages devoted to the pictures of the
    rulers of the various nations. Prominently placed among these
    was a large photograph of Colonel Roosevelt.</p>

    <p>"Father," asked Prince Edward, placing his finger on the
    Colonel's picture, "Mr. Roosevelt is a very clever man, isn't
    he?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, child," answered King George with a smile. "He is a
    great and good man. In some respects I look upon him as a
    genius."</p>

    <p>A few days later, King George, casually glancing through the
    album, noticed that President Roosevelt's photograph had been
    removed and placed in the section devoted to "Men and Women of
    the Time." On asking the Prince whether he had removed the
    picture, the latter solemnly replied: "Yes, sir. You told me
    the other day that you thought Mr. Roosevelt a genius, so I
    took him away from the kings and emperors and put him among the
    famous people."</p><a name="H_0324"

    <h2>KISSES</h2>

    <p>Jack disliked being kissed. One day he had been kissed a
    lot. Then, to make matters worse, on going to the
    picture-palace in the evening, instead of his favorite cowboy
    and Indian pictures there was nothing but a lot more hugging
    and kissing. He returned home completely out of patience with
    the whole tribe of women.</p>

    <p>After he had been tucked into bed mother came in to kiss him
    good-night.</p>

    <p>He refused.</p>

    <p>Mother begged and begged, till in disgust he turned to his
    father, who was standing at the doorway, looking on, and
    said:</p>

    <p>"Daddy, for heaven's sake, give this woman a kiss!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>People who throw kisses are mighty near hopelessly lazy.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"If you kiss me again," declared Miss Lovely firmly, "I
    shall tell father."</p>

    <p>"That's an old tale," replied the bold, bad young man.
    "Anyhow, it's worth it," and he kissed her.</p>

    <p>Miss Lovely sprang to her feet. "I shall tell father," she
    said and left the room.</p>

    <p>"Father," she said softly to her parent when she got
    outside, "Mr. Bolder wants to see your new gun."</p>

    <p>"All right, I'll take it to him," said her father, and two
    minutes later he appeared in the doorway with his gun in his
    hand.</p>

    <p>There was a crash of breaking glass as Mr. Bolder dived
    through the window and departed in all haste for the railway
    station.&mdash;<i>Judge</i>.</p>

    <p>Before introducing Lieutenant de Tessan, aid to General
    Joffre, and Colonel Fabry, the "Blue Devil of France," Chairman
    Spencer, of the St. Louis entertainment committee, at the M. A.
    A. breakfast told this anecdote.</p>

    <p>"In Washington, Lieutenant de Tessan was approached by a
    pretty American girl, who said:</p>

    <p>"'And did you kill a German soldier?'</p>

    <p>"'Yes,' he replied.</p>

    <p>"'With what hand did you do it?' she inquired.</p>

    <p>"'With this right hand,' he said.</p>

    <p>"And then the pretty American girl seized his right hand and
    kissed it. Colonel Fabry stood near by. He strolled over and
    said to Lieutenant de Tessan:</p>

    <p>"'Heavens, man, why didn't you tell her that you bit him to
    death.'"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>According to Dr. Bramer, the savages of Brumari Island never
    kiss each other. Judging by their photographs, we don't blame
    them.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A girl was asked to explain why men never kiss each other,
    while women do. She replied:</p>

    <p>"Men have something better to kiss; women haven't."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A kiss is a peculiar proposition. Of no use to one, yet
    absolute bliss to two. The small boy gets it for nothing, the
    young man has to steal it, and the old man has to buy it. The
    Baby's right, the Lover's privilege, the Hypocrite's mask. To a
    young girl, faith; to a married woman, hope; to an old maid
    charity.</p><a name="H_0325"

    <p>Wilson Barrett used to tell an amusing story against

    and see him play in "The Lights o' London," at the Princess's
    Theater.</p>

    <p>They said they didn't mind if they did, and being given
    complimentary tickets, all went on a Saturday night to see
    their employer's performance.</p>

    <p>At the end of the week Barrett's eye caught sight of this
    item against each workman's name on the pay-sheet: "Saturday
    night. Four hours' overtime at Princess's Theater, eight

    <h2>LABOR-SAVING DEVICES</h2>

    Colombia.</p>

    <p>At that time, it appears, his knowledge of South America was
    limited, and he viewed the sights with a keener interest than
    he does today. While he was waiting for the train in which he
    was to travel to Barranquilla, two peons went by with a
    wheelbarrow minus the wheel. It was a contrivance with handles
    at both ends, and it required the services of two men to move
    it.</p>

    <p>Turning to a steamer acquaintance, the American asked him if
    there were no real wheelbarrows in the place.</p>

    <p>"Oh, no," replied the Colombian; "we use these ingenious
    devices so that two men may do the work of
    one."</p><a name="H_0329"

    <p>In traveling along a road in a motor car, there will be
    several cars ahead of you going your way, and there will be
    several cars coming toward you. Also ahead of you, going your
    way, there may be a hay wagon or a farmer in a buggy. As you
    speed along, you look ahead and declare to yourself that there
    is no logical way in which you can get through the spaces thus
    created. Yet the vehicles always form themselves into the right
    combination, and you pass through easily. This is the way with
    life. There are always obstacles that you do not see how you
    can pass without a smash-up. But you always get by.</p>

    <p>"How?"</p>

    <p>"You see a pretty girl; you stop; you look; after you marry
    her, and for the rest of your life, you listen."</p>

    <p>Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you
    could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget
    them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day, begin it well
    and serenely, and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with
    your old nonsense. This day is all that is good and fair. It is

    <h2>LISPING</h2>

    <p>A young lady who lisped very badly was treated by a
    specialist, and learned to say the sentence: "Sister Susie's
    Sewing Shirts for Soldiers."</p>

    <p>She repeated it to her friends, and was praised upon her

    <p>OLD GENTLEMAN (in street car)&mdash;"Has anyone here dropped

    <p>The following exchange of courtesy was recently chronicled
    in a German paper's advertisements:</p>

    <p>"The gentleman who found a brown purse, containing a sum of
    money, in the Blumenstrasse, is requested to forward it to the
    address of the loser, as he is recognized."</p>

    <p>A couple of days later appeared the response, which, altho
    courteous, had an elusive air, to say the least:</p>

    <p>"The recognized gentleman who picked up a brown purse in the
    Blumenstrasse requests the loser to call at his house at a
    convenient day."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A small boy came hurriedly down the street, and halted
    breathlessly in front of a stranger going in the same
    direction.</p>

    <p>"Have you lost half a crown?" he asked with his hand in his
    pocket.</p>

    <p>"Y-es, yes, I believe I have!" said the stranger feeling in
    his pockets. "Have you found one?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, no," said the small boy. "I just want to see how many
    have been lost today. Yours makes fifty-four!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The young lady from New York was inclined to belittle
    things.</p>

    <p>"Why," she remarked, "I could find my way up this mountain
    path alone."</p>

    <p>"Wal," responded the native, "a young couple went up this
    path last year and never came back."</p>

    <p>"Oh, my! Were they lost?"</p>

    <p>"Nope," was the reply, "they went down the other side!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The other day when the beach was crowded, a small boy,
    looking rather bewildered, approached a police officer and
    said, "Please, sir, have you seen anything of a lady around
    here?"</p>

    <p>"Why, yes," answered the officer, "I've seen several."</p>

    <p>"Well, have you seen any without a little boy?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Well," said the little chap, as a relieved look crossed his
    face, "I'm the little boy. Where's the lady?"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>One does not mean to be personal, but, if the young man who
    sat in the chair where a lady had left a dish of maple sugar to
    cool at the festival the other evening, will return the saucer,
    he will save himself further trouble.</p><a name="H_0352"

    <p>A recent experience of a Virginia clergyman throws light on
    the old English law requiring that marriages should be
    celebrated before noon. A colored couple appeared before him,
    asking to be married, the man in a considerably muddled state.
    The minister said to the woman, "I won't perform this
    ceremony."</p>

    <p>"Why is dat, boss?" she queried. "Ain't de license all
    right? An' we is of age."</p>

    <p>"Yes, but the man is drunk. Take him away and come back
    again." Several days later the couple again presented
    themselves, the man once more obviously intoxicated. "See here,
    I told you I wouldn't marry you when this man was drunk," the

    <h2>MILK</h2>

    <p>"You are charged with selling adulterated milk," said the
    judge.</p>

    <p>"Your Honor, I plead not guilty."</p>

    <p>"But the testimony shows that it is 25 per cent water."</p>

    <p>"Then it must be high-grade milk," returned the plaintiff.
    "If your Honor will look up the word 'milk' in your dictionary
    you will find that it contains from 80 to 90 per cent water. I
    should have sold it for cream!"</p>

    <p>The morning milk delivered at the parsonage was certainly
    weak, and the head of the household considered it necessary to
    remonstrate. "Are you aware," he remarked to the milkman, "that
    we require this milk for the hitherto recognized purposes?"</p>

    <p>"I hope so, sir," replied the tradesman.</p>

    <p>"That's all right, then," returned the parson gently; "I
    merely mentioned it in case you may have thought we wanted it
    for the font."</p>

    <p>On the outskirts of Philadelphia is an admirable stock farm.
    One day last summer some poor children were permitted to go
    over this farm, and when their inspection was done, to each of
    them was given a glass of milk. The milk was excellent.</p>

    <p>"Well, boys, how do you like it?" the farmer said, when they
    had drained their glasses.</p>

    <p>"Fine," said one little fellow. Then after a pause, he
    added, "I wisht our milkman kept a cow."</p><a name="H_0372"

    <h2>OBITUARIES</h2>

    <p>Upon the recent death in a Western town of a politician,
    who, at one time, served his country in a very high legislative
    place, a number of newspaper men were collaborating on an
    obituary notice.</p>

    <p>"What shall we say of the former Senator?" asked one of the
    men.</p>

    <p>"Oh, just put down that he was always faithful to his
    trust."</p>

    <p>"And," queried a cynical member of the group, "shall we
    mention the name of the trust?"&mdash;<i>Puck</i>.</p>

    <p>A certain prominent lawyer of Toronto is in the habit of
    lecturing his office staff from the junior partner down, and
    Tommy, the office boy, comes in for his full share of the
    admonition. That his words were appreciated was made evident to
    the lawyer by a conversation between Tommy and another office
    boy on the same floor, which he recently overheard.</p>

    <p>"Wotcher wages?" asked the other boy.</p>

    <p>"Ten thousand a year," replied Tommy.</p>

    <p>"Aw, g'wan!"</p>

    <p>"Sure," insisted Tommy, unabashed. "Four dollars a week in
    cash an' de rest in legal advice."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"I can't keep the visitors from coming up," said the office
    boy, dejectedly, to the president. "When I say you're out they
    simply say they must see you."</p>

    <p>"Well," said the president, "just tell them that's what they
    all say."</p>

    <p>That afternoon there called at the office a young lady. The
    boy assured her it was impossible to see the president.</p>

    <p>"But I'm his wife," said the lady.</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's what they all say," said the boy.</p>

    <p>Into the office of a business man rushed a bright faced lad.
    For three minutes he waited and then began, to show signs of

    <p>"Excuse me, sir," he said at length, "I'm in a hurry."</p>

    <p>"Well, what do you want?" asked the business man.</p>

    <p>"A job!"</p>

    <p>"But why the hurry?"</p>

    <p>"Got to hurry," replied the lad briefly. "Left school
    yesterday, and haven't struck anything suitable yet. The only
    place where I can stay long is where they pay me for it."</p>

    <p>"How much do you want?"</p>

    <p>"Fifteen dollars a week for a start."</p>

    it forget it.&mdash;<i>Ralph Waldo Trine</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>If your confidence needs buttressing, just stop for a moment
    and consider that this old world in which we have found such
    happiness has throughout the past ages been visited by every
    catastrophe of which the human mind can conceive, and from each
    of these dark periods it has emerged always and eternally a
    progressive world.</p>

    <p>Finally, I say, cheer up. Let's look on the bright side
    rather than the dark side, and above all let us understand that
    there are no insurmountable obstacles standing in the path of
    our progress, that we are competent to solve the things that
    confront us, that they will be solved, and that humankind will
    be benefited by the virtue of our assuming an optimism in which
    we are fully justified.&mdash;<i>Lewis L. Clark</i>.</p>

    <p>A certain people were much given to deploring war. War, they
    kept insisting, was poor business.</p>

    <p>Their King heard them, but he didn't take them seriously.
    The very first chance he got he picked a quarrel with a
    neighboring Power, and, that done, he lifted up his voice in
    the old way.</p>

    <p>"The fatherland is in danger!" he cried. "The honor of the
    nation is assailed! My children, be patriots!"</p>

    <p>But they couldn't see him. "Not on your life!" they made
    answer. "You can fool all the people some of the time and some
    of the people all of the time, but you can not fool all the
    people all the time!"</p>

    <p>Whereupon the King made haste to patch up his quarrel and
    was very careful forever after not to pick another.</p>

    selling rabbit sausage by the wagon-load.</p>

    <p>"But the pure-food inspectors came prying around, and asked
    Tom how he could make so much sausage when he got only a few
    dozen rabbits a day. Finally he admitted that there was some
    horse-meat in the sausage. Then they wanted to know how much
    horse-meat. After a long grilling he said it was fifty per

    <p>"Why, no, I am sorry to say," replied the grocer. "The fact
    is, I have promised my support to the other candidate."</p>

    <p>The politician laughed. "Ah," said he, "in politics,
    promising and performing are two different things."</p>

    <p>"In that case," said the grocer cordially, "I shall be glad

    <h2>PRAYERS</h2>

    <p>A very nice and gentle minister accepted a call to a new
    church in a town where many of the members bred horses and
    sometimes raced them. A few weeks later he was asked to invite
    the prayers of the congregation for Lucy Grey. Willingly and
    gladly he did so for three Sundays. On the fourth one of the
    deacons told the minister he need not do it any more.</p>

    <p>"Why," asked the good man, with an anxious look, "is she
    dead?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, no," said the deacon; "she's won the steeplechase."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The two men were adrift in an open boat and it looked bad
    for them. Finally one of them, frightened, began to pray.</p>

    <p>"O Lord," he prayed, "I've broken most of Thy commandments.
    I've been a hard drinker, but if my life is spared now I'll
    promise Thee never again&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Lindsley had the little hen fast and was trying to bring her

    coming upon the small girl in the yard.</p>

    <p>"I'm trying to make this hen say her prayers."</p>

    <p>"Well," said the parent sadly, "I hope she'll say: 'Now I
    lay me.'"</p>

    <p>A small boy, whose father is now on the other side with the
    Y.M.C.A., was taught to say at the end of his prayer, "Please,
    God, make Graham a good boy." One night he did not say it, and
    when his mother asked him if he had not forgotten something, he
    said, "No; I thought I was asking too much of God. I'd better

    <p>Bobby had been taught to remember all his relatives when he

    satisfactory.'</p>

    <p>"'Yes,' I said a little puzzled.</p>

    <p>"'Yes, exactly,' said he. 'It was soothing because over half
    the congregation went to sleep. It was moving because half of
    the other half left before I was through. And it must have been
    satisfactory, inasmuch as I wasn't asked to come again.'"</p>

    Father's house are many mansions.... I go to prepare a place
    for you.' By the way, where is he going?"</p>

    <h2>PRIDE</h2>

    <p>Randolph Bourne, a brilliant American writer who recently
    died, left many thoughts that stand out like cut diamonds. Here
    is one: "Only Pride is creation."</p>

    <p>Pride forms one of the towering pillars in the structure of
    efficient performance.</p>

    <p>Not until you feel the worth of what you do, are you able
    freely to dominate and achieve. Through the hard days of
    darkness and discouragement, up and beyond the gruelling grades
    of steep ways, are you asked to go if you desire substantial
    reward. It takes pride to endure.</p>

    <p>It is pride in a man's heart that makes him a willing gift,
    in mind and body, to be taken in hand by some great idea or
    noble cause.</p>

    <p>Pride does not stoop to littleness. Rather does it see in
    the signs of unselfishness and sacrifice the elements that lead
    to eternal character.</p>

    <p>Life is but a link in the chain of everlasting good.</p>

    <p>If a man dies, does lie live again? Yes, for a man lives
    forever in the deeds and thoughts of his life expression. And
    every man who shall pass his thought through every age that has
    been, shall be whitened and renewed, to go on his way the
    better for every creative thought left behind.</p>

    <p>It's the pride in a man's soul that leads him on!</p>

    <p>Pride creates first&mdash;then contributes in natural
    turn.</p>

    <p>Until we become too proud to stoop to mean ways and unworthy
    ends, we shall have tasted of but a sample of what life holds
    in substance and bigness.&mdash;<i>George Matthew
    Adams</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>To acknowledge our faults when we are blamed is modesty; to
    discover them to one's friends in ingenuousness, is confidence;
    but to preach them to all the world, if one does not take care,
    is pride.&mdash;<i>Confucius</i>.</p><a name="H_0453"

    <h2>PRINTERS</h2>

    <p>Some of the finest jokes extant come through the fact that
    the printer's finger slips. Here are some which, like all
    others, are funny a long, long, long time afterward&mdash;never
    at the time.</p>

    <p>A Chicago paper reported that the propeller <i>Alaska</i>
    was leaving port with a cargo of 40,000 bushels of cats.</p>

    <p>A Buffalo paper, in describing the scene when Roosevelt took
    the oath of office as President, said it was a spectacle never
    to be forgotten when Roosevelt, before the Chief Justice of the
    Supreme Court and a few witnesses, took his simple

    <h2>PROFANITY</h2>

    <p>When father came home to dinner he observed a vacant chair
    at the table. "Where's the boy?" he asked, nodding to the
    chair.</p>

    <p>"Harry is up-stairs," came in a tone of painful precision
    from the mother.</p>

    <p>"I hope he is not sick."</p>

    <p>There was an anxious pause. "No, he is not sick," continued
    the mother. "It grieves me to say, Richard, that our son, your
    son, has been heard swearing on the street. I heard him
    myself."</p>

    <p>"Swearing!" exclaimed the father. "I'll teach him to
    swear!"</p>

    <p>And with that the angry parent started up-stairs in the
    dark. Half-way up he stumbled and came down with his chin on
    the top step.</p>

    <p>When the confusion had subsided Harry's mother was heard
    saying from the hallway: "That will do, Richard, dear. You have
    given him enough for one lesson."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Sometime ago a pious young clerical prevailed on a rather
    profane aviator to take him for a flight. After attaining
    several thousand feet the motor suddenly stopped, revealing to
    the uttermost the aviator's gift of profanity.</p>

    <p>The alarmed pastor excitedly demanded if there was any
    danger. The pilot replied sarcastically that there would be
    prayer instead of profanity if there was any danger.</p>

    <p>The motor "cut in" again and the flight continued. Suddenly
    the motor stopped again and notwithstanding the pilot's
    efforts, accompanied by the usual lurid language, he was forced
    to alight. Just as he flattened out for his landing, the pilot
    was disconcerted by hearing the parson exclaim in fervid tones:
    "Thank God the aviator is still swearing."</p>

    <p>Small Ann's mother had been disturbed to hear her using the
    word "devil." "My dear," said she, "that is a word we do
    <i>not</i> use in polite society, and I never want to hear you
    say it again."</p>

    <p>She noticed that her admonition was carefully heeded. Then
    on Sunday evening, about two weeks later, the mother inquired
    what the day's lesson had been about. "Why, mother," was Ann's
    answer, "it was about when our Lord was tempted by
    the&mdash;by&mdash;by&mdash;the&mdash;the <i>gentleman that

    <h2>PROFESSIONS</h2>

    <p>An ambitious young man went to a university professor and
    said: "Sir, I desire a course of training which will fit me to
    become the superintendent of a great railway system. How much
    will such a course cost, and how long will it take?"</p>

    <p>"Young man," replied the professor, "such a course would
    cost you twenty thousand dollars, and require twenty years of
    your time. But, on the other hand, by spending three hundred
    dollars of your money and three months of your time you may be
    elected to Congress. Once there you will feel yourself
    competent to direct not one but all the great railroad systems
    of our country."</p>

    if there was an opening. There wasn't. He was asked if he was
    adept at anything else. "Yes," he replied, with a smile, "I am

    <p>"If a man brings his car to me to be repaired, and it costs
    me sixty cents, and I charge him sixteen dollars, what per cent
    profit would I be making?" he demanded of his son and heir.</p>

    <p>"I'm sure I don't know, pop," answered that young hopeful.
    "You'll have to get somebody who knows the rules of grand
    larceny to tell you that. The rules for percentage wouldn't
    cover it!"</p>

    <p>He drew her close to him.</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid, darling!" he said gently. "Would you like
    me to ask your mother first?"</p>

    <p>With a sudden cry of alarm she threw her arms around his

    Afterward the shy admirer drew near, his love made valiant by

    said as they stood alone in a corner.</p>

    Taft spoke first and at considerable length, and when he had
    finished the audience rose, almost to a man, to leave the

    <p>A political meeting was on in a certain Iowa town and Thomas
    R. Marshall, Vice-President of the United States, was to speak.
    The hall was packed and the air was stifling. For some reason,
    it was impossible to open the windows, and one had to be
    broken.</p>

    <p>It was feared that the noise would startle the audience and
    perhaps throw them into a panic. The mayor of the town stepped
    forward to give warning. The audience, however, had not
    assembled to listen to the mayor, and overwhelmed him with
    cries of "Marshall! Marshall!"</p>

    <p>Silence was not restored till the infuriated official yelled
    at the top of his voice:</p>

    <p>"I'm not going to make a speech! I have something to
    say!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Do you know what it is to go before an audience?"</p>

    <p>"No. I spoke before an audience once, but most of it went
    before I did."</p>

    <p>A lank, disconsolate-looking farmer, stood on the steps of
    the town hall during the progress of a political meeting.</p>

    <p>"Do you know who's talking in there now?" demanded a
    stranger, briskly, pausing for a moment beside the farmer. "Or
    are you just going in?"</p>

    <p>"No, sir; I've just come out," said the farmer, decidedly.
    "Congressman Smiffkins is talking in there."</p>

    <p>"What about?" asked the stranger.</p>

    <p>"Well," continued the countryman, passing a knotted hand
    across his forehead, "he didn't say."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"You haven't had much to say lately," commented the old
    friend.</p>

    <p>"True," replied Senator Sorghum. "But you must give me
    credit for one thing&mdash;I realized the fact and kept
    still."</p>

    <p>Captain "Ian Hay," on one of his war lecture tours, entered
    a barber's shop in a small town to have his hair cut.</p>

    <p>"Stranger in the town, sir?" the barber asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes, I am," Ian Hay replied. "Anything going on here
    tonight?"</p>

    <p>"There's a war lecture by an English fighter named Hay,"
    said the barber: "but if you go you'll have to stand, for every
    seat in the hall is sold out."</p>

    <p>"Well, now," said Ian Hay, "isn't that provoking? It's
    always my luck to have to stand when that Hay chap
    lectures."</p>

    <p>The president of a certain railway in Kentucky which is only
    ten miles long, was exchanging annual passes one year with
    officials of other railways.</p>

    <p>He enclosed an annual pass on his railway to Stuyvesant
    Fish, then president of the Illinois Central Railway, for
    himself and family, with the request that Fish reciprocate.</p>

    <p>It seems that Fish had never heard of the Kentucky road, so
    he instructed his secretary to look it up. As a result the pass
    was returned with the following curt letter:</p>

    <blockquote>
        DEAR SIR:

        <p>I find that your railroad is only ten miles long, while
        my road is eleven hundred miles long. I herewith return

    see, the engineer is mad with the station agent!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Now will this train reach its destination on time?"</p>

    <p>"We hope so, but we don't guarantee it."</p>

    <p>"You mean you sell me a ticket to get to a certain place by
    a certain time and then you give me no assurance I'll be there
    at that time?"</p>

    is ready to start, so I won't!"</p>

    <p>"We are twenty minutes late," remarked the passenger. "Will
    we make it up before we reach New York?"</p>

    <p>"Eh-yah! Young Doc. Purt is a pretty good doctor," admitted
    the landlord of the Petunia tavern, in reply to the inquiry of
    a guest who felt the need of a physician's advice. "In spite of

    <p>"Because I supposed all cultivated, intelligent Americans
    came from Boston."</p>

    <p>"But what in the world made you think that?" was the natural
    question.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I don't know, exactly. I think it was a Boston lady who
    told me."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Having heard a popular make of motor-car highly spoken of,
    he entered the depot with the idea of purchasing one. The
    selection was soon made, and the customer expressed himself
    ready to buy if he could have a trial trip. That, the salesman
    explained, was impossible; the cars were sold on their
    reputation only. The customer declined to buy without a trial,
    and was leaving the store when the chairman of the company
    entered, and the situation was explained to him.</p>

    <p>The chairman agreed that the salesman's attitude was
    correct. "But," said he, "as I don't like turning money away,
    I'll take you for a run in the car myself." The selected car
    was brought out, the chairman took the driving wheel, the
    customer sat alongside him, and the run began.</p>

    <p>For some time she ran beautifully. Then, halfway up a hill,
    there was a sudden stoppage, and, do what he would, the driver
    could not induce the car to move.</p>

    <p>Said the customer: "A jolly good thing I insisted on a
    trial."</p>

    <p>Very red in the face, the chairman left the car, went to the
    front and lifted the bonnet to see what was the matter. "Holy
    smoke!" he exclaimed. "She's got no engine in her. She's run
    two miles on nothing but her reputation."</p><a name="H_0496"

    <h2>RESTAURANTS</h2>

    <p>A gentleman from the rural districts of Missouri recently
    made his first visit to New York. Shortly after his arrival he
    went into a restaurant and ordered what seemed to him like a
    rather meager meal. When the bill was presented it totaled
    $8.35. The Missourian looked at the amount twice to make sure
    his eyes were not deceiving him. Then he smiled. "Waiter," he
    called, "you've made a mistake. I've got more money than
    that!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>GUEST&mdash;"Look here! How long must I wait for the
    half-portion of duck I ordered?"</p>

    <p>Dr. C&mdash;&mdash;, who was called to the far end of Long
    Island to extract an appendix, missed the last train back,
    stayed over night in a miserable hotel, and was waited on at
    breakfast by a sallow and cadaverous country girl. Said
    she:</p>

    <p>"Boiled tongue, stewed kidneys, fried liver."</p>

    <p>Said he:</p>

    <p>"Hang your symptoms! Bring me something to eat!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"What's yours?"</p>

    <p>"Coffee and rolls, my girl."</p>

    <p>One of those iron-heavy, quarter-inch, thick mugs of coffee
    was pushed over the counter. The fastidious person seemed
    dazed. He looked under the mug and over it.</p>

    <p>"But where is the saucer?" he inquired.</p>

    <p>"We don't give no saucers here. If we did some low-brow'd
    come pilin' in an' drink out of his saucer, an' we'd lose a lot
    of our swellest trade."</p>

    <p>"Do you want a steak for a dollar or a dollar and a half?"
    demanded the waiter in the Central Park restaurant.</p>

    <p>"You get a sharp knife with the dollar and half steak,"

    <h2>RETALIATION</h2>

    <p>Even though the war was over, she decided to do her
    patriotic duty along the hospitality line. So she called the
    Army and Navy Club, and transmitted her invitation through a
    suave-voiced officer.</p>

    <p>"I am Mrs. Humpfree McLeod, 33 First Avenue," she explained,
    "and I should like to have two of your men come to dinner with
    us Sunday at half-past one."</p>

    <p>"Yes. Thank you, Mrs. McLeod."</p>

    <p>"But wait&mdash;be sure, whatever you do, that they aren't
    Jews!"</p>

    <p>The tone of her voice was emphatic.</p>

    <p>Sunday came, bringing two chocolate-colored khaki-clad
    privates to the McLeod house. When Mrs. McLeod brushed into the
    drawing-room to greet her soldiers, all a-smile, she was
    surprised, to put it mildly.</p>

    <p>"Why!" she stammered. "Why, who invited you here?"</p>

    <p>"Our commanding officer," explained one, "Captain
    Cohen."</p>

    <p>One morning Jorkins looked over his fence and said to his
    neighbor, Harkins:</p>

    <p>"What are you burying in that hole?"</p>

    <p>"Just replanting some of my seeds, that's all," was the
    answer.</p>

    <p>"Seeds!" exclaimed Jorkins, angrily. "It looks more like one
    of my hens!"</p>

    <p>"That's all right," said the other. "The seeds are
    inside."&mdash;<i>Harper's</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"What's coming off out in front there?" asked the proprietor
    of the Tote Fair store in Tumlinville, Ark.</p>

    <p>"A couple of fellers from Straddle Ridge swapped mules,"
    replied the clerk, "and now each is accusing the other of
    skinning him."</p>

    <p>"Well, then, why don't they trade back?"</p>

    <p>"I reckon they are both afraid of getting skinned
    again."</p>

    <p>"It was mighty nice of you to give up your seat to that
    stout old lady, Mr. Blinks. It is pleasant to see that there
    are still some polite men left in the world."</p>

    <p>"Sorry, Mrs. Jabbers, but it wasn't politeness at all. The
    man who sat next to me was quarrelsome because he said I
    crowded him too much, and all I did was to use that stout old
    lady as a sort of retort courteous."&mdash;<i>Judge</i>. "All
    sorts and conditions of men have excellent explanations for
    their position in life," said the Senator. "A tramp, however,
    came under my observation who had no illusions about the cause

    friend and said:</p>

    <p>"'Well, the P.D.R. will never see another cent of my money
    after this.'</p>

    <p>"The conductor, who was departing, looked back and
    snarled:</p>

    <p>An English nobleman was about to set out for India, and,
    fearing that in his absence vandals might destroy a picturesque
    ruin on his estate, he said to his steward: "I want you to
    build a wall here"&mdash;he drew a tiny furrow with his stick
    around the ruin&mdash;"a stone wall five feet high."</p>

    <p>On his return home the nobleman started for the spot. When
    he reached it he rubbed his eyes in amazement. There was the
    new stone wall, but he could see nothing towering up inside of
    it. He turned excitedly to his steward:</p>

    <p>"Look here, where's the ruin, man?"</p>

    <h2>SAFETY</h2>

    <p>Throughout the trial the Englishman, whose crimes had been
    many and black, bore himself with an air of complete
    indifference and received the sentence of the supreme penalty
    with a bored yawn. After he had been led on to the scaffold and
    just as the hood and noose were about to be placed over his
    head, the attendant priest, still persisting in his attempts to
    awaken penitence, in spite of the doomed man's deafness to his
    prayers, asked him again for a final statement.</p>

    <p>The prisoner's gaze wandered to the noose and rested there
    meditatively. Suddenly he turned to the priest:</p>

    <p>"See here, old chap," he demanded, "is this thing perfectly
    safe?"</p>

    <p>Mark Twain once sat in the smoking room of a steamer and
    listened for an hour to some remarkable stories. Then he
    drawled, "Boys, these feats of yours that you've been telling
    about recall an adventure of my own in Hannibal. There was a
    fire in Hannibal one night, and Old Man Hankinson got caught in
    the fourth story of the burning house. It looked as if he was a
    goner. None of the ladders was long enough to reach him. The
    crowd stared at one another with awed eyes. Nobody could think
    of anything to do.</p>

    <p>"Then all of a sudden, boys, an idea occurred to me. 'Fetch
    a rope!' I yelled.</p>

    <p>"Somebody fetched a rope, and with great presence of mind I
    flung the end of it up to the old man. 'Tie her round your
    waist!' I yelled. Old Man Hankinson did so, and I pulled him

    <h2>SCOTCH, THE</h2>

    <p>An Englishman, Scotchman and Irishman were indulging in
    reminiscences of sporting occasions.</p>

    <p>"The closest race I ever saw was a yacht race," deposed the
    Englishman, "in which one of the boats that had been recently
    painted won by the breadth of the coat of paint."</p>

    <p>"The closest race I ever saw," declared the Scotchman, "was
    one in which a horse, stung by a bee, won by the eighth of the
    swelling of his nose."</p>

    <p>"The closest race I ever saw," said the Irishman, "is the
    Scotch."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Some travellers returning to their hotel in Edinburgh one
    evening noticed an old Scotchman working anxiously over a
    penny-in-the-slot machine that refused to deliver his purchase
    or to return the penny. The next morning on passing the same
    spot they saw the poor man dead beside the slot machine.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Two old Scotsmen sat by the roadside, talking and puffing
    away merrily at their pipes.</p>

    <p>"There's no muckle pleasure in smokin', Sandy," said
    Donald.</p>

    <p>"Hoo dae ye mak' that oot?" questioned Sandy.</p>

    <p>"Weel," said Donald, "ye see, if ye're smokin' yer ain bacca
    ye're thinkin' o' the awfu' expense, an' if ye're smokin' some
    ither body's, yer pipe's ramm't sae tight it winna draw."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A Scotchman had been presented with a pint flask of rare old
    Scotch whisky. He was walking briskly along the road toward
    home, when along came a Ford which he did not side-step quite
    in time. It threw him down and hurt his leg quite badly. He got
    up and limped down the road. Suddenly he noticed that something
    warm and wet was trickling down his leg.</p>

    <p>"Oh, God," he groaned, "I hope that's blood!"</p>

    <p>During the fighting a Highlander had the misfortune to get
    his head blown off.</p>

    <p>A comrade communicated the sad news to another gallant Scot,

    <p>A Scottish emigrant on his arrival at Montreal, stopped for
    a moment to examine a coat hanging in front of a clothing
    store, when the proprietor asked him if he would not try on a
    coat.</p>

    <p>"I dinna ken but I wad," responded the emigrant, consulting
    his watch; and he went in and set to work. No matter how often
    he found a fit, he tried on another and another till he tried
    on about thirty. Then, again looking at his watch, he resumed
    his own garment and walked off saying:</p>

    <p>"Weel, I've lost time, nae doot, but hang the fellow that'll
    no' obleege anither when he can!"</p>

    <p>Three Scotchmen were in church one Sunday morning when the
    minister made a strong appeal for some very worthy cause,
    hoping that every one in the congregation would give at least
    one dollar or more. The three Scots became very nervous as the
    collection plate neared them, when one of them fainted and the
    other two carried him out.</p>

    <p>Mr. MacTavish attended a christening where the hospitality
    of the host knew no bounds except the several capacities of the
    guests. In the midst of the celebration Mr. MacTavish rose up
    and made rounds of the company, bidding each a profound
    farewell.</p>

    <p>"But, Sandy, man," objected the host, "ye're not going yet,
    with the evenin' just started?"</p>

    <p>"Nay," said the prudent MacTavish. "I'm no' goin' yet. But
    I'm tellin' ye good-night while I know ye all."</p>

    <p>A Scotchman was strolling through the market-place one day
    with his faithful collie at his heels. Attracted by a fine
    display of shell and other fish, the Scot stopped to admire,
    perhaps to purchase. The dog stood by gently wagging its tail
    while its master engaged the fishmonger in conversation.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately for the dog, its tail dropped for a moment
    over a big basketful of fine live lobsters. Instantly one of
    the largest lobsters snapt its claws on the tail and the
    surprised collie dashed off through the market, yelping with
    pain, while the lobster hung on grimly, tho dashed violently
    from side to side. The fishmonger for a moment was speechless
    with indignation. Then turning to his prospective customer, he
    bawled:</p>

    <p>"Mon, mon! whustle to yer dog! Whustle to yer dog!"</p>

    <p>"Hoot, mon," returned the other, complacently, "whustle to

    <p>The Chief Justice while presiding over the Supreme Court at
    Washington took the several Justices of the Court for a run
    down Chesapeake Bay. A stiff wind sprang up, and Justice Gray
    was getting decidedly the worst of it. As he leaned over the
    rail in great distress the Chief Justice touched him on the
    shoulder and said in a tone of deepest sympathy:</p>

    <p>"Is there anything I can do for you, Gray?"</p>

    <p>"No, thank you," returned the sick Justice, "unless your

    <p>"O-o-oh!" was the only response as the young man rolled over
    in agony.</p>

    <p>"Come, get up," derided the surgeon, grinning unfeelingly.
    "The ship's been torpedoed and will sink in ten minutes."</p>

    <p>"Ten minutes?" the sick man protested feebly. "Can't you
    make it any sooner?"</p>

    <p>Mrs. Wilson wanted to get Mrs. Johnson's cook away from her
    so badly that she actually went to Mrs. Johnson's house when
    she was away and offered the cook more money. The next time
    they met at a big dinner Mrs. Johnson did not notice her.</p>

    <p>"Mrs. Johnson, you know Mrs. Wilson, do you not?" said the
    lady who sat between them.</p>

    <p>"No, I believe not," said Mrs. Johnson, "but I understand
    that she calls on my cook."</p>

    <p>MR. EXE&mdash;"Did you tell the cook that the beefsteak was
    burned?"</p>

    her it was just right, but that we preferred it a trifle
    underdone."</p>

    <p>"What!" exclaimed the other. "And you so fond of
    dancing!"</p>

    <p>"I'd love to go," explained the conscientious maid, "but to
    tell you the truth, I am afraid to leave the baby with its

    <p>"A flirt, am I!" exclaimed Mary Ann, under notice to go.
    "Well, I know them as flirts more than I do, and with less

    "I'm better looking than you. More 'andsome. 'Ow do I know?
    Your husband told me so."</p>

    <p>"That will do," said her mistress, frigidly.</p>

    <p>"Very well, thank you," was the reply.</p>

    <p>Mrs. X. had lost her cook and had telephoned in vain for
    another. Dinner guests were expected and she was desperate.
    Finally, putting on her things, she went out, and she hadn't
    gone far when she met a neat-looking colored woman. She
    explained her dilemma and the colored woman listened in
    silence, then she said: "Where do yo' live, missus?"</p>

    <p>Seeing a ray of hope joyfully, Mrs. X. gave her address, to

    <p>Mr. Roberts, a banker in a Western town, was very bald and
    was in the habit of wearing his hat in the bank during business
    hours. Every week a negro employee of the bank presented a
    check and drew his wages. One day, as he was putting the money
    in a worn and greasy wallet, the banker chanced to pass by, and
    asked, "Look here, John, why don't you let some of that money
    stay in the bank and keep an account with us?"</p>

    <p>"Well, sah," replied the negro, leaning toward the banker

        <p>To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the
        greater achievement of the future.</p>

        <p>To wear a cheerful countenance at all times, and to have
        a smile for every living creature you meet.</p>

        <p>To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that
        you will have no time to criticize others.</p>

        <p>To be too big for worry, too noble for anger and too
        strong for fear.</p>

        <p>To think well of your self and to proclaim this fact to
        the world&mdash;not in loud words, but in great deeds.</p>

        <p>To live in the faith that the world is on your side so
        long as you are true to the best that is in you.</p>
    </div>
    <hr />

    <p>The world knows but little of failures, and cares less. The
    world only watches the successes.</p>

    <p>Stop worrying over things that can't be helped and go and do
    things that can be done.</p>

    <p>Few people care a continental for your failure. Few, if any,
    will help.</p>

    <p>You may sit and magnify your mistakes, mourn and go mad over
    your blunders, but men will only smile that cynical smile and
    say of you, "He's no good."</p>

    <p>Self-pity, sympathy soliciting, wishing and wailing will
    only let you down lower. Brace up. Brush up. Think up. And you
    will get up. Think down. Look down. Act down. And you will stay
    down.</p>

    <p>Paint your face with a smile. Advertise that you are a
    success. Then think and work for it.</p>

    <p>Whatever you think you are is the price they will pay.</p>

    <h2>TEACHING</h2>

    <p>About the most hopeful element in any human being's
    character I should reckon to be teachableness.</p>

    <p>Wherever you meet a man who knows&mdash;and knows he
    knows&mdash;and wards off any proof of reasoning of yours with
    the impenetrable shield of a superior smile or the dull
    hostility of a determined eye, you feel that between you and
    him there can be no real dealings.</p>

    <p>The wisest minds I find are the most teachable. The wider
    one's experience, the more thorough his study, the braver his
    heart, and the stronger his intelligence, the more willing he
    is to hear what you or any man may have to offer.</p>

    <p>Stubbornness is usually the instinctive self-defense of
    conscious weakness. When one can do nothing else to show his
    strength he imitates the mule&mdash;the most despised of
    animals.</p>

    <p>Pat walked into the post-office. After getting into the
    telephone-box he called a wrong number. As there was no such
    number, the switch-attendant did not answer him. Pat shouted
    again, but received no answer.</p>

    <p>The lady of the post-office opened the door and told him to
    shout a little louder, which he did, but still no answer.</p>

    <p>Again she said he would have to speak louder.</p>

    <p>Little Molly had been very trying all day. That evening,
    when her grown-up sister was putting her to bed, she said she
    hoped the child would be a better girl tomorrow, and not make
    everybody unhappy with her naughty temper.</p>

    <p>Molly listened in silence, thought hard for a few moments,
    and then said, wisely:</p>

    <p>"Yes, when it's me it's temper; when it's you it's

    it was at the bottom of the sea."</p>

    <p>As they were leaving the hall the lecturer encountered

    <h2>THEATER</h2>

    <p>Reynold Wolf tells this one of Nora Bayes:</p>

    <p>Once Miss Bayes was appearing in a breakfast scene where
    eggs were being served, and a child sitting in a box made
    manifest his interest in the food. Stepping down to the
    footlights she tendered the youngster an egg, but his mother
    drew back her child with a sign of annoyance.</p>

    <p>"You should let the young man take it," said Miss Bayes,
    quietly. "It is unique for eggs to be passed from this side of
    the footlights."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A big fat man at the theater sat on his overcoat. Thus the
    little man behind him could not see at all.</p>

    <p>"I can't see anything, mister," said the little man
    plaintively, touching the big man on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>"Can't see anything, hey?"</p>

    <p>"No, sir, I can't see a thing."</p>

    <p>"Well, then, I'll fix you up. Just keep your eye on me, and
    laugh when I do."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A vast and determined-looking woman wore a very large hat
    one evening at the theater.</p>

    <p>"Madam," said the attendant politely, "I must request you to
    remove your hat. It is annoying this gentleman behind you."</p>

    <p>The massive lady turned and haughtily surveyed the
    complainant. "Do you mean that little weedy, undersized
    creature?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"This gentleman behind you," the attendant corrected
    her.</p>

    <p>The lady settled herself down in her place. "You will find
    it easier and pleasanter," she said, decisively, "to remove
    him!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A Clergyman once wrote to Edwin Booth, the famous tragedian,
    asking if he might be admitted to Booth's theater by a private
    door, because, though he very much wished to see Booth act, he
    didn't like the idea of being seen entering a theater. Booth
    wrote back, "Sir, there is no door into my theater through
    which God can not see."</p>

    <p>He was a very small boy, and the apples he was eyeing were
    very large. He eyed them for ten minutes, longingly and
    furtively, while the greengrocer bustled about serving
    customers. Now he edged near the tempting basket. Now he edged
    away again. And at last the greengrocer thought it time to
    intervene.</p>

    <p>"Now then, Tommy," he exclaimed, "what are you doing?"</p>

    <p>"Nothin'," replied the small boy.</p>

    <p>In the office of the prison warden at Canon City, Colorado,
    a clever and notorious swindler was being divested of the
    contents of his pockets. As each article was removed, it was
    carefully examined, listed and then placed temporarily on a
    nearby desk. Among the articles was a badly tarnished silver
    dollar, barely distinguishable as money.</p>

    <p>At the conclusion of the search, the prisoner pointed to the
    dull-looking coin and in a suppliant tone asked the warden:</p>

    <p>"Would you mind letting me keep that with me?"</p>

    <p>"Why?" asked the warden.</p>

    <p>"Oh, just a little sentiment, I suppose," the prisoner
    explained. "You know, it's the first dollar I ever stole."</p>

    <h2>THRIFT</h2>

    <p>Mr. Benson went to New York to business, but lived in
    Brooklyn. Often he was not able to get home in time for dinner
    at night. He told his wife that he would phone her every day as
    to whether he could leave the office or not.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Benson was of a very thrifty disposition, and the
    following was her solution of the problem: "Sam, if you find
    that you can't be home for dinner, phone me at exactly six
    o'clock. If the telephone rings at that hour, I'll know it is

    <h2>TROUBLE</h2>

    <p>The cheery caller tried to persuade old Aunt Martha not to
    dwell upon her troubles, telling her she would feel happier if
    she ignored them. "Well, honey," said the old lady, "I dunno

    <h2>TRUTH</h2>

    <p>Many truths expressed are never claimed at their

    <p>Truth is elastic. Don't stretch it unless you want it to fly

    <p>FIRST STUDENT (wearily)&mdash;"I suppose I'll be up all
    night tonight; I have to make out my expense account."</p>

    <p>The two village trouble-makers had gotten into a row and the
    matter was up in court. Uncle Wash, an old gentleman of color,
    was a witness.</p>

    <p>"Now, uncle," said the lawyer, "tell me just what
    conversation occurred."</p>

    <p>"I kain't jes' remember it all," replied the candid Wash,
    "excep' dat each one was callin' de other what dey is."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Truth crushed to earth will rise again" said the hopeful

    <p>"Yes," replied the cynic; "but it's liable to have to go

    <h2>UMBRELLAS</h2>

    <p>"It says here that a Missouri man boasts that he has an
    umbrella that has been in his possession for twenty years,"
    said Smith.</p>

    <p>"Well," replied Jones, "that's long enough. He ought to
    return it."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>FIRST ARTIST&mdash;"The umbrella you lent me? I have lent it
    to a friend."</p>

    <p>SECOND ARTIST&mdash;"That is very awkward. The man who lent
    it to my friend tells him that the owner wants it."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Little girl, why aren't you provided with an umbrella?"
    "Because father hasn't been to church this
    year."&mdash;<i>Puck</i>.</p>

    <p>"Young man," said the fond father, "in giving you my
    daughter, I have entrusted you with the dearest treasure of my
    life."</p>

    <p>The young man was duly impressed and made no endeavor to
    conceal his emotion and his gratitude. Then, during the few
    moments of impressive silence that followed, he heard the
    patter, patter of rain against the window.</p>

    <p>"Goodness me!" he exclaimed, "it's raining and I haven't my
    umbrella! May I borrow yours, sir, to keep me dry while I run
    to the station?"</p>

    <p>"Young man," said the fond parent, "I do not trust anyone
    with my umbrella!"</p><a name="H_0596"

    <h2>VANITY</h2>

    <p>Little Beryl, aged ten, was a very pretty and intelligent
    girl, but she had one fault&mdash;she was inclined to be vain.
    At every available opportunity she gazed at herself
    complacently in the looking-glass. Her fond papa noticed that
    the habit was growing upon her and took upon himself the duty
    of correcting it.</p>

    <p>"Why do you always look in the glass?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"I was just thinking how nice I looked," answered Beryl.</p>

    <p>"You mustn't be so vain, child. Remember we are all as
    nature made us."</p>

    <p>"Did nature make you, papa?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <h2>VENTILATION</h2>

    <p>American people have a very high appreciation of the humor
    of Englishmen, and have been specially tickled by a story
    Colonel Cody used to tell. He said that some years ago an
    Englishman who had never been in the West before was his guest.
    They were riding through a Rocky-Mountain canon one day, when
    suddenly a tremendous gust of wind came swooping down upon them
    and actually carried the Englishman clean off the wagon-seat.
    After he had been picked up, he combed the sand and gravel out
    of his whiskers and said:</p>

    <p>"I say! I think you overdo ventilation in this country!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The street-car conductor examined the transfer thoughtfully
    and said meekly, "This here transfer expired an hour ago,
    lady." The lady, digging into her purse after a coin, replied,
    "No wonder, with not a single ventilator open in the whole

    <p>In St. Louis there is one ward that is full of breweries. In
    a recent election the local option question was up. After the
    election the clerks were counting the votes. One was calling
    off and another taking down the option votes. The first clerk,
    running rapidly through the ballots, said: "Wet, wet, wet,
    wet." Suddenly he stopped. "Mein Gott!" he cried. "Dry!" Then
    he went on: "Wet, wet, wet, wet." Presently he stopped again

    <p>A person died. He willed all his earthly possessions to be
    divided among an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotchman. But
    the will was conditional; each of the legatees was to place
    five pounds in the testator's coffin. On the day appointed (by
    Fate) the Englishman placed a five-pound note, as willed; the
    Irishman collected a number of coins somehow&mdash;shillings,
    sixpences and coppers&mdash;and made up his contribution of
    five pounds, which he placed on the Englishman's fiver. The
    Scotchman then made out a cheque for fifteen pounds and,
    pocketing the ten pounds already deposited, threw in his cheque
    with the remark, "That's easier."</p>

    <p>A month later, when the Scotchman perused his pass-book, he
    was surprised to find that his cheque had been cashed.</p>

    <p>The undertaker was a Welshman.</p><a name="H_0611"

    <h2>WESTMINSTER ABBEY</h2>

    <p>It is a platitude that different people get peculiarly
    different impressions from viewing the same sights. A Suffolk
    girl, who had been staying in London for a short holiday, was
    asked on her return if she had been in Westminster Abbey.
    "Yes," she replied, "I went in and sat down, but I didn't stay
    long, as I prefer open-air cemeteries."</p><a name="H_0612"

    <p>A Rhondda man went into a public-house and called for a

    <p>"Which did you put in first, the whisky or the water?"</p>

    <p>"The whisky, of course," the publican replied.</p>

    <p>"Ah, well," said the Rhondda man, "perhaps I'll come to it

    <p>"If you want to be really popular with men," says Mr. Arthur

    <p>Dinah's husband had just been killed on the Railroad while
    discharging his duties as a brakeman. An agent of the road
    promptly settled her claim by the payment of a thousand
    dollars. Her friends consoled her with the thought that with so
    much money she would be the most sought after woman in
    Darktown. She stoutly maintained that she would not marry again
    and that she "had no plans" but finally said between her sobs

    <h2>WINDOWS</h2>

    <p>Without windows there would be no fresh-air fiends. A single
    window may make or mar a whole household. Used occasionally by
    burglars, small boys and lovers, the singular power of the
    window to control our destiny has not hitherto been recognized.
    Without windows there would be no ghost stories, for how could
    the rain beat on the pane, or the wind come in short gusts
    through the cracks? Neither would there be melodrama, for how
    could the heroine crouch on the floor if there were no sudden
    flashes of lighting or falling snow to gaze at through the
    window? What poems have been written by just looking through a
    window; and as for literature in general, who does not remember
    the window in Thrums? The first thing we look at upon entering
    a room is the windows. At night the window is the last thing we
    adjust, and in the morning the first we gaze out of. The first
    window was the beginning of civilization. Consider the window
    of a cell, how symbolic it is of a dwarfed and misdirected
    life. The composite health of any community can almost be
    predicated upon the number of its windows that are kept open at
    night.</p>

    <p>Then there are the windows of the soul, without which no
    best seller would be worth the price of

    <h2>WITNESSES</h2>

    <p>The day was drawing to a close. Judge, jurors, witnesses,
    and lawyers all were growing weary. Counsel for the prosecution
    was cross-examining the defendant.</p>

    <p>"Exactly how far is it between the two towns?" he asked at
    length.</p>

    <p>For some time Paddy stood thinking, then, "About four miles
    as the cry flows," came the answer.</p>

    <p>"You mean 'as the flow cries!'" corrected the man of
    law.</p>

    <p>The judge leaned forward. "No," he remarked suavely, "he
    means 'as the fly crows.'"</p>

    <p>And they all looked at one another, feeling that something
    was wrong somewhere.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A lawyer was examining a Scottish farmer. "You'll affirm
    that when this happened you were going home to a meal. Let us
    be quite certain on this point, because it is a very important
    one. Be good enough to tell me, sir, with as little
    prevarication as possible, what meal it was you were going home
    to."</p>

    <p>"You would like to know what meal it was?" said the
    Scotsman.</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir; I should like to know," replied the counsel,
    sternly and impressively. "Be sure you tell the truth."</p>

    <p>"Well, then, it was just oatmeal."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>A boy of eight entered the witness-box in tremendous boots,
    long trousers rolled up so that the baggy knees were at the
    ankles, and a swallow-tail coat that swept the floor.</p>

    <p>"Why are you dressed like that?" asked the judge, both
    amazed and amused.</p>

    <p>The boy took from his pocket the summons and pointed
    solemnly to the words: "To appear in his father's suit."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The prosecuting attorney had encountered a somewhat
    difficult witness. Finally he asked the man if he was
    acquainted with any of the men on the jury.</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir," announced the witness, "more than half of
    them."</p>

    <p>"Are you willing to swear that you know more than half of
    them?" demanded the lawyer.</p>

    <p>"Why, if it comes to that, I'm willing to swear that I know
    more than all of them put together."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Do you understand what you are to swear to?" asked the
    court as a not over-intelligent looking negro took the witness
    stand.</p>

    <p>"Yes, sah, Ah does. Ah'm to sweah to tell de truf."</p>

    <p>"Yes," said the Judge; "and what will happen if you do not
    tell the truth?"</p>

    meeting-places were closed, and the entire population was
    compelled to wear masks to prevent the spread of the disease, a
    drunken man was overheard muttering:</p>

    <p>"Well, I'm an old man, but I have lived my time and am ready
    to quit. I have lived to see four great things come to
    pass&mdash;the end of the war, the churches closed, saloons
    left open, and the women muzzled."&mdash;<i>Judge</i>.</p>

    <p>"Woman! Feminism! Suffrage! Bah! Why, there isn't a woman

    <p>"That's because," said Miss Barrymore calmly, "so many men
    are stupid while so few are blind."</p>

    <p>The young man had just been accepted. In his rapture he

    you?"</p>

    <p>Young Arthur was wrestling with a lesson in grammar.
    "Father," said he, thoughtfully, "what part of speech is

    <h2>WOMAN'S RIGHTS</h2>

    <p class="ctr"><i>Why We Oppose Pockets For Women</i></p>

    <p>1. Because pockets are not a natural right.</p>

    <p>2. Because the great majority of women do not want pockets.
    If they did, they would have them.</p>

    <p>3. Because whenever women have had pockets they have not
    used them.</p>

    <p>4. Because women are expected to carry enough things as it
    is without the additional burden of pockets.</p>

    <p>5. Because it would make dissension between husband and wife
    as to whose pockets were to be filled.</p>

    <p>6. Because it would destroy man's chivalry toward woman if
    he did not have to carry all her things in his pockets.</p>

    <p>7. Because men are men and women are women. We must not fly
    in the face of nature.</p>

    <p>8. Because pockets have been used by men to carry tobacco,
    pipes, whisky flasks, chewing-gum, and compromising letters, we
    see no reason to suppose that women would use them more
    wisely.</p><a name="H_0622"

    need it. Men make work; but work makes men. An office is not
    merely a place for making money; it is a place for making men.
    A workshop is not a place for making machinery only; it is a

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
