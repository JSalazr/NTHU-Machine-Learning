<h3><i>PREFACE</i></h3>

<p>The old figure of speech 'in the fulness of time' embodies a truth too
often forgotten. History knows nothing of spontaneous generation; the
chain of cause and effect is unbroken, and however modest be the scale on
which an historical work is cast, the reader has a right to ask that it
should give him some idea, not only of what happened, but of why it
happened. A catalogue of dates and names is as meaningless as the
photograph of a crowd. In the following retrospect, I have attempted to
trace the principal factors that worked towards Italian unity. The
Liberation of Italy is a cycle waiting to be turned into an epic.</p>

<p>In other words, it presents the appearance of a series of detached
episodes, but the parts have an intimate connection with the whole, which,
as time wears on, will constantly emerge into plainer light. Every year
brings with it the issue of documents, letters, memoirs, that help to
unravel the tangled threads in which this subject has been enveloped, and
which have made it less generally understood than the two other great
struggles of the century, the American fight for the Union, and the
unification of Germany.</p>

<p>I cannot too strongly state my indebtedness to the voluminous
literature which has grown up in Italy round the <i>Risorgimento</i> since
its completion; yet it must not be supposed that the witness of
contemporaries published from hour to hour, in every European tongue,
while the events were going on, has become or will ever become valueless.
I have had access to a collection of these older writings, formed with
much care between the years 1850-1870, and some authorities that were
wanting, I found in the library of Sir James Hudson, given by him to Count
Giuseppe Martinengo Cesaresco after he left the British legation at
Turin.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many books in which the affairs of Italy figure
only incidentally, which ought to be consulted by anyone who wishes to
study the inner working of the Italian movement. Of such are Lord
Castlereagh's <i>Despatches and Correspondence</i>, and the
autobiographies of Prince Metternich and Count Beust.</p>

<p>Perhaps I have been helped in describing the events clearly, by the
fact that I am familiar with almost all the places where they occurred,
from the heights of Calatafimi to the unhappy rock of Lissa. Wherever the
language of the <i>Si</i> sounds, we tread upon the history of the
Revolution that achieved what a great English orator once called, 'the
noblest work ever undertaken by man.'</p>

<p>The supreme interest of the re-casting of Italy arises from the new
spectacle of a nation made one not by conquest but by consent. Above and
beyond the other causes that contributed to the conclusion must always be
reckoned the gathering of an emotional wave, only comparable to the
phenomena displayed by the medi&aelig;val religious revivals. Sentiment,
it is said, is what makes the real historical miracles. A writer on
Italian Liberation would be indeed misleading who failed to take account
of the passionate longing which stirred and swayed even the most outwardly
cold of those who took part in it, and nerved an entire people to heroic
effort.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h4>RESURGAM</h4>

<h5>Italy from the Battle of Lodi to the Congress of Vienna.</h5>

<br />


<p>The unity of Italy, which the statesmen of Europe and all save a small
number of the Italians themselves still regarded as an utopia when it was
on the verge of accomplishment, was, nevertheless, desired and foreseen by
the two greatest intellects produced by the Italian race. Dante conceived
an Italy united under the Empire, which returning from a shameful because
self-imposed exile would assume its natural seat in Rome. To him it was a
point of secondary interest that the Imperial Lord happened to be bred
beyond the Alps, that he was of Teutonic, not of Latin blood. If the
Emperor brought the talisman of his authority to the banks of the Tiber,
Italy would overcome the factions which rent her, and would not only rule
herself, but lead mankind. Vast as the vision was, Dante cannot be called
presumptuous for having entertained it. The Rome of the C&aelig;sars, the
Rome of the Popes, had each transformed the world: Italy was transforming
it for a third time at that moment by the spiritual awakening which,
beginning with the <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">
[Pg.2]</a></span> Renaissance, led by inevitable steps to the Reformation.
The great Florentine poet had the right to dream that his country was
invested with a providential mission, that his people was a chosen people,
which, by its own fault and by the fault of others, had lost its way, but
would find it again. Such was Dante's so-called Ghibelline
programme&mdash;less Ghibelline than intensely and magnificently Italian.
His was a mind too mighty to be caged within the limits of partisan
ambitions. The same may be said of Machiavelli. He also imagined, or
rather discerned in the future, a regenerate Italy under a single head,
and this, not the advancement of any particular man, was the grand event
he endeavoured to hasten. With the impatience of a heart consumed by the
single passion of patriotism, he conjured his fellow-countrymen to seize
the first chance that presented itself, promising or unpromising, of
reaching the goal. The concluding passage in the <i>Principe</i> was meant
as an exhortation; it reads as a prophecy. 'We ought not therefore,'
writes Machiavelli, 'to let this occasion pass whereby, after so long
waiting, Italy may behold the coming of a saviour. Nor can I express with
what love he would be received in all those provinces which have suffered
from the foreign inundations; with what thirst of vengeance, with what
obstinate faith, with what worship, with what tears! What doors would be
closed against him? What people would deny him obedience? What jealousy
would oppose him? What Italian would not do him honour? The barbarous
dominion of the stranger stinks in the nostrils of all.'</p>

<p>Another man of genius, an Italian whom a fortuitous circumstance made
the citizen and the master of a country not his own, grasped both the
vital necessity of unity from an Italian point of view, and the certainty
of its ultimate achievement. Napoleon's notes on the <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg.3]</a></span> subject, written
at St Helena, sum up the whole question without rhetoric but with
unanswerable logic:&mdash;'Italy is surrounded by the Alps and the sea.
Her natural limits are defined with as much exactitude as if she were an
island. Italy is only united to the Continent by 150 leagues of frontier,
and these 150 leagues are fortified by the highest barrier that can be
opposed to man. Italy, isolated between her natural limits, is destined to
form a great and powerful nation. Italy is one nation; unity of customs,
language and literature must, within a period more or less distant, unite
her inhabitants under one sole government. And Rome will, without the
slightest doubt, be chosen by the Italians as their capital.'</p>

<p>Unlike Dante and Machiavelli, who could only sow the seed, not gather
the fruit, the man who wrote these lines might have made them a reality.
Had Napoleon wished to unite Italy&mdash;had he had the greatness of mind
to proclaim Rome the capital of a free and independent state instead of
turning it into the chief town of a French department&mdash;there was a
time when he could plainly have done it. Whether redemption too easily won
would have proved a gain or a loss in the long run to the populations
welded together, not after their own long and laborious efforts, but by
the sudden exercise of the will of a conqueror, is, of course, a different
matter. The experiment was not tried. Napoleon, whom the simple splendour
of such a scheme ought to have fascinated, did a very poor thing instead
of a very great one: he divided Italy among his relations, keeping the
lion's share for himself.</p>

<p>Napoleon's policy in Italy was permanently compromised by the
abominable sale of Venice, with her two thousand years of freedom, to the
empire which, as no one knew better than he did, was the pivot of European
despotism. After that transaction he could never again come before the
Italians with clean hands; they might for a season make him <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg.4]</a></span> their idol,
carried away by the intoxication of his fame; they could never trust him
in their inmost conscience. The ruinous consequences of the Treaty of
Campo Formio only; ceased in 1866. The Venetians have been severely
blamed, most of all by Italian historians, for making Campo Formio
possible by opening the door to the French six months before. Napoleon
could not have bartered away Venice if it had not belonged to him. The
reason that it belonged to him was that, on the 12th of May 1797, the
Grand Council committed political suicide by dissolving the old
aristocratic form of government, in compliance with a mere rumour,
conveyed to them through the ignoble medium of a petty shopkeeper, that
such was the wish of General Buonaparte. In extenuation of their fatal
supineness, it may be urged that they felt the inherent weakness of an
oligarchy out of date; and in the second place, that the victor of Lodi,
the deliverer of Lombardy, then in the first flush of his scarcely
tarnished glory, was a dazzling figure, calculated indeed to turn men's
heads. But, after all, the only really valid excuse for them would have
been that Venice lacked the means of defence, and this was not the case.
She had 14,000 regular troops, 8000 marines, a good stock of
guns&mdash;how well she might have resisted the French, had they, which
was probable, attacked her, was to be proved in 1849. Her people,
moreover, that <i>basso popolo</i> which nowhere in the world is more free
from crime, more patient in suffering, more intelligent and
public-spirited than in Venice, was anxious and ready to resist; when the
nobles offered themselves a sacrifice on the Gallic altar by welcoming the
proposed democratic institutions, the populace, neither hoodwinked nor
scared into <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">
[Pg.5]</a></span> hysterics, rose to the old cry of San Marco, and
attempted a righteous reaction, which was only smothered when the
treacherous introduction of French troops by night on board Venetian
vessels settled the doom of Venice's independence.</p>

<p>'Under all circumstances,' Napoleon wrote to the Venetian Municipality,
'I shall do what lies in my power to prove to you my desire to see your
liberty consolidated, and miserable Italy assume, at last, a glorious
place, free and independent of strangers.' On the 10th of the following
October he made over Venice to Austria, sending as a parting word the
cynical message to the Venetians 'that they were little fitted for
liberty: if they were capable of appreciating it, and had the virtue
necessary for acquiring it well and good; existing circumstances gave them
an excellent opportunity of proving it.' At the time, the act of betrayal
was generally regarded as part of a well-considered plot laid by the
French Directory, but it seems certain that it was not made known to that
body before it was carried out, and that with Napoleon himself it was a
sort of after-thought, sprung from the desire to patch up an immediate
peace with Austria on account of the appointment of Hoche to the chief
command of the army in Germany. The god to which he immolated Venice was
the selfish fear lest another general should reap his German laurels.</p>

<p>Venice remained for eight years under the Austrians, who thereby
obtained what, in flagrant perversion of the principles on which the
Congress of Vienna professed to act, was accepted in 1815 as their
title-deeds to its possession. Meanwhile, after the battle of Austerlitz,
the city of the sea was tossed back to Napoleon, who incorporated it in
the newly-created kingdom of Italy, which no more corresponded to its name
than did the Gothic kingdom of which he <span class="newpage"><a name=

when, placing the Iron Crown of Theodolinda upon his brow, he uttered the
celebrated phrase: 'Dieu me l'a donn&eacute;e, gare &agrave; qui la
touche.'</p>

<p>This is not the place to write a history of French supremacy in Italy,
but several points connected with it must be glanced at, because, without
bearing them in mind, it is impossible to understand the events which
followed. The viceroyalty of Eug&egrave;ne Beauharnais in North Italy, and
the government of Joseph Buonaparte, and afterwards of Joachim Murat, in
the South, brought much that was an improvement on what had gone before:
there were better laws, a better administration, a quickening of
intelligence. 'The French have done much for the regeneration of Italy,'
wrote an English observer in 1810; 'they have destroyed the prejudices of
the inhabitants of the small states of Upper Italy by uniting them; they
have done away with the Pope; they have made them soldiers.' But there was
the reverse side of the medal: the absence everywhere of the national
spirit which alone could have consolidated the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i> on
a firm basis; the danger which the language ran of losing its purity by
the introduction of Gallicisms; the shameless robbery of pictures,
statues, and national heirlooms of every kind for the replenishment of
French museums; the bad impression left in the country districts by the
abuses committed by the French soldiery on their first descent, and kept
alive by the blood-tax levied in the persons of thousands of Italian
conscripts sent to die, nobody knew where or why; the fields untilled, and
Rachel weeping for her children: all these elements combined in rendering
it difficult for the governments established under French auspices to
survive the downfall of the man to whose sword they owed their existence.
Their <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg.7]</a></span>
dissolution was precipitated, however, by the discordant action of Murat
and Eug&egrave;ne Beauharnais. Had these two pulled together, whatever the
issue was it would have differed in much from what actually happened.
Murat was jealous of Eug&egrave;ne, and did not love his brother-in-law,
who had annoyed and thwarted him through his whole reign; he was uneasy
about his Neapolitan throne, and, in all likelihood, was already dreaming
of acquiring the crown of an independent Italy. Throwing off his
allegiance to Napoleon, he imagined the vain thing that he might gain his
object by taking sides with the Austrians. It must be remembered that
there was a time when the Allied Powers had distinctly contemplated
Italian independence as a dyke to France, and there were people foolish
enough to think that Austria, now she felt herself as strong as she had
then felt weak, would consent to such a plan. Liberators, self-called,
were absolutely swarming in Italy; Lord William Bentinck was promising
entire emancipation from Leghorn; the Austrian and English allies in
Romagna ransacked the dictionary for expressions in praise of liberty; an
English officer was made the mouthpiece for the lying assurance of the
Austrian Emperor Francis, that he had no intention of re-asserting any
claims to the possession of Lombardy or Venetia.</p>

<p>In 1814, Napoleon empowered Prince Eug&egrave;ne to adopt whatever
attitude he thought best fitted to make head against Austria; for himself,
he resigned the Iron Crown, and his Italian soldiers were freed from their
oaths. It was not, therefore, Eugene's loyal scruples which prevented him
from throwing down a grand stake when he led his 60,000 men to the attack.
It was want of genius, or of what would have done instead, a flash of
genuine enthusiasm for the Italian idea. In place <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg.8]</a></span> of appealing to all Italians
to unite in winning a country, he appealed to one sentiment only, fidelity
to Napoleon, which no longer woke any echo in the hearts of a population
that had grown more and more to associate the name of the Emperor with
exactions which never came to an end, and with wars which had not now even
the merit of being successful. It is estimated that although the Italian
troops amply proved the truth of Alfieri's maxim, that 'the plant man is
more vigorous in Italy than elsewhere,' by bearing the hardships and
resisting the cold in Russia better than the soldiers of any other
nationality, nevertheless 26,000 Italians were lost in the retreat from
Moscow. That happened a year ago. Exhausted patience got the better of
judgment; in April 1814, the Milanese committed the irremediable error of
revolting against their Viceroy, who commanded the only army which could
still save Italy: the pent-up passions of a long period broke loose, the
peasants from the country, who had always hated the French, flooded the
streets of Milan, and allying themselves unimpeded with the dregs of the
townsfolk, they murdered with great brutality General Prina, the Minister
of Finance, whose remarkable abilities had been devoted towards raising
funds for the Imperial Exchequer. Personally incorruptible, Prina was
looked upon as the general representative of French voracity; he met his
death with the utmost calmness, only praying that he might be the last
victim. No one else was, in fact, killed, and next day quiet was resumed,
but the affair had another victim&mdash;Italy. You cannot change horses
when you are crossing a stream. Prince Eug&egrave;ne was in Mantua with a
fine army, practically intact, though it had suffered some slight
reverses; the fortress was believed to be impregnable; by merely waiting,
Eugene <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">
[Pg.9]</a></span> might, if nothing else, have exacted favourable terms.
But the news of Prina's murder, and the blow dealt at his own authority in
Milan, caused him to give over the fortress and the army to the Austrians
without more ado; an act which looked like revenge, but it was most likely
prompted by moral cowardice. The capitulation signed with Field-Marshal
Bellegarde on the 23rd of April, so exasperated the army that the officers
in command of the garrison decided to arrest Eugene, but it was found that
he was already on his way to Germany, taking with him his treasure, in
accordance with a secret agreement entered into with the Austrian
Field-Marshal. Such was the end to the Italian career of Eug&egrave;ne
Beauharnais.</p>

<p>For the <i>Beau Sabreur</i> another ending was in store. Back on
Napoleon's side in 1815, his Austrian allies having given him plenty of
reason for suspecting their sincerity, he issued from Rimini, on the 30th
of March, the proclamation of an independent Italy from the Alps to
Sicily. There was no popular reply to his call. Italy, prostrate and
impoverished, was unequal to a great resolve. The Napoleonic legend was
not only dead, but buried; Napoleon had literally no friends left in Italy
except those of his old soldiers who had managed to get back to their
homes, many of them deprived of an arm or a leg, but so toughened that
they lived to great ages. These cherished to their last hour the worship
of their Captain, which it was his highest gift to be able to inspire. 'I
have that feeling for him still, that if he were to rise from the dead I
should go to him, if I could, wherever he was,' said the old conscript
Emmanuele Gaminara of Genoa, who died at nearly a hundred in a Norfolk
village in 1892: the last, perhaps, of the Italian veterans, and the type
of them all.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg.10]</a></span>

<p>But a few scattered invalids do not make a nation, and the Italian
nation in 1815 had not the least wish to support any one who came in the
name of Napoleon. So Murat failed without even raising a strong current of
sympathy. Beaten by the Austrians at Tolentino on the 3rd of May, he
retreated with his shattered army. In the last desperate moment, he issued
the constitution which he ought to have granted years before. Nothing
could be of any avail now; his admirable Queen, the best of all the House
of Buonaparte, surrendered Naples to the English admiral; and Murat,
harried by a crushing Austrian force, renounced his kingdom on the 30th of
May. After Waterloo, when a price was set on his head in France, he
meditated one more forlorn hope; but, deserted by the treachery of his few
followers, and driven out of his course by the violence of the waves, he
was thrown on the coast of Calabria with only twenty-six men, and was shot
by order of Ferdinand of Naples, who especially directed that he should be
only allowed half-an-hour for his religious duties after sentence had been
delivered by the mock court-martial. His dauntless courage did not desert
him: he died like a soldier. It was a better end for an Italian prince
than escaping with money-bags to Germany. Great as were Murat's faults, an
Italian should remember that it was he who first took up arms to the cry
which was later to redeem Italy: independence from Alps to sea; and if he
stand on the ill-omened shore of Pizzo, he need not refuse to uncover his
head in silence.</p>

<p>When Mantua surrendered, the Milanese sent a deputation to Paris with a
view of securing for Lombardy the position of an independent kingdom under
an Austrian prince. They hoped to obtain the first by <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg.11]</a></span> acquiescing in
the second. They were aroused from their unheroic illusions with startling
rapidity. Lord Castlereagh, to whom they went first (for they fancied that
the English were interested in liberty), referred them 'to their master,
the Austrian Emperor.' The Emperor Francis replied to their memorial that
Lombardy was his by right of conquest; they would hear soon enough at
Milan what orders he had to give them. Even after that, the distracted
Lombards hoped that the English at Genoa would befriend them. All
uncertainty ceased on the 23rd of May 1814, when Field-Marshal Bellegarde
formally took possession of Lombardy on behalf of his Sovereign, dissolved
the Electoral Colleges, and proclaimed himself Regent. There was no
question of reviving the conditions under which Austria ruled Lombardy
while there was still a German Empire: conditions which, though despotic
in theory, were comparatively easy-going in practice, and did not exclude
the native element from the administration. Henceforth the despotism was
pure and simple; for Italians to even think of politics was an act of high
treason.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that a British army ultimately sent to Spain
was intended for Italy,<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> but its destination was changed because
the Italians showed so little disposition to rise against Napoleon. The
English Government was continually advised by its agents in Italy to make
Sicily, which was wholly in its power, the <i>point d'app&ugrave;i</i> for
a really great intervention in the destinies of the peninsula. 'The grand
end of all the operations in the Mediterranean,' wrote one of Lord
Castlereagh's correspondents, 'is the emancipation of Italy, and its union
in one great state.' Lord William Bentinck urged that if Sicily were
reunited to Naples under the Bourbons, liberty, <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg.12]</a></span> established there by his
own incredible efforts, would be crushed, and the King would wreck
vengeance on the Constitution and its supporters. Universal terror, he
said, was felt at 'the unforgiving temper of their Majesties.' He strongly
supported a course proposed for her own reasons by Queen Caroline: the
purchase of Sicily by the English Government which could make it 'not only
the model but the instrument of Italian independence.'</p>

<p>This way of talking was not confined to private despatches, and it was
no wonder if the Italians were disappointed when they found that England
declined to plead their cause with the Allies in Paris, and afterwards at
Vienna. When charged directly with breach of faith before the House of
Commons, Lord Castlereagh said that Austria, being 'in truth the great
hinge on which the fate of mankind must ultimately depend,' had to be paid
(this was exactly the sense, though not the form, of his defence) by
letting her do what she liked with Italy. There is a certain brutal
straightforwardness in the line of argument. Lord Castlereagh did not say
that independence was not a good thing. He had tried to obtain it for
Poland and had failed; he had not tried to obtain it for Italy, because he
was afraid of offending Austria. At least he had the courage to tell the
truth, and did not prate about the felicity of being subjects of the
Austrian Emperor, as many English partisans of Austria prated in days to
come.</p>

<p>The political map of Italy in the summer of 1814 showed the Pope (Pius
VII.) reinstated in Rome, Victor Emmanuel I. at Turin, Ferdinand III. of
Hapsburg-Lorraine in Tuscany, the Genoese Republic for the moment restored
by the English, Parma and Piacenza assigned to the Empress Marie-Louise,
and Modena to the Austrian Archduke Francis, who was heir through the
female line to the last of the Estes. Murat was still <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg.13]</a></span> at Naples,
Ferdinand IV. in Sicily, Austria acknowledged supreme in Lombardy and
Venetia, and the island of Elba ironically handed over to Napoleon. These
were the chief features, so far as Italy was concerned, of the Treaty of
Paris, signed on the 30th of May 1814. Next year the Congress of Vienna
modified the arrangement by providing that the Spanish Infanta Maria
Louisa, on whom had been bestowed the ex-republic of Lucca, should have
the reversion of Parma and Piacenza, while Lucca was to go in the end to
Tuscany. Murat having been destroyed, the Neapolitan Bourbons recovered
all their old possessions. San Marino and Monaco were graciously
recognised as independent, which brought the number of Italian states up
to ten. The Sardinian monarchy received back the part of Savoy which by
the Treaty of Paris had been reserved to France. It was also offered a
splendid and unexpected gift&mdash;Genoa.</p>

<p>Lord William Bentinck entered Genoa by a convention concluded with the
authorities on the 18th of April 1814. A naval demonstration following an
ably-conducted operation, by which Bentinck's hybrid force of Greeks and
Calabrese, with a handful of English, became master of the two principal
forts, hastened this conclusion, but the Genoese had no reluctance to open
their gates to the English commander, who inspired them with the fullest
confidence. He came invested with the halo of a
constitution-maker-under-difficulties; it was known that he had stopped at
nothing in carrying out his mission in Sicily; not even at getting rid of
the Queen, who found in Bentinck the Nemesis for having led a greater
Englishman to stain his fame in the roads of Naples. Driven rather than
persuaded to leave Sicily, Marie Antoinette's sister encountered so
frightful a sea voyage that she died soon after <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg.14]</a></span> joining her relations at
Vienna. Lord William had acquired the art of writing the finest appeals to
the love of freedom; a collection of his manifestoes would serve as
handy-book to anyone instructed to stir up an oppressed nationality. He
immediately gave the Genoese some specimens of his skill as a writer, and
by granting them at once a provisional constitution, he dispelled all
doubts about the future recognition of their republic. What was not,
therefore, their dismay, when they were suddenly informed of the decision
of the Holy Alliance to make a present of them to the people whom, of all
others, they probably disliked the most. Italians had not ceased yet from
reserving their best aversion for their nearest neighbours.</p>

<p>Bentinck did not mean to deceive; perhaps he thought that by going
beyond the letter of his instructions he should draw his government after
him. That he did, in effect, deceive, cannot be denied; even Lord
Castlereagh, while necessarily refusing to admit that definite promises
had been made, yet allowed that, 'Of course he would have been glad if the
proclamation issued to the Genoese had been more precisely worded.' The
motive of the determination to sacrifice the republic was, he said, 'a
sincere conviction of the necessity of a barrier between France and Italy,
which ought to be made effectual on the side of Piedmont. The object was
to commit the defence of the Alps and of the great road leading round them
by the Gulf of Genoa, between France and Italy, to the same power to which
it had formerly been entrusted. On that principle, the question relating
to Genoa had been entertained and decided upon by the allied sovereigns.
It was not resolved upon because any particular state had unworthy or
sordid views, or from any interest or feeling in favour of the King of
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg.15]</a></span>
Sardinia, but solely to make him, as far as was necessary, the instrument
of the general policy of Europe.'</p>

<p>A better defence might have been made. Piedmont was destined to serve
as a bulwark, not so much against France, which for the time was not to be
feared, as against Austria, absolute except for the subalpine kingdom in
all Italy. But this belongs to the shaping of rough-hewn ends, which is in
higher hands than those of English ministers. The ends then looked very
rough-hewn.</p>

<p>Piedmont was a hotbed of reaction and bigotry. True, she had a history
differing vastly from that of the other Italian states, but the facts of
the hour presented her in a most unattractive light. The Genoese felt the
keenest heart-burnings in submitting to a decision in which they had no
voice, and which came to them as a mandate of political extinction from
the same powers that confirmed the sentence of death on Genoa's ancient
and glorious rival. The seeds were laid of disaffection, always
smouldering among the Genoese, till Piedmont's king became King of Italy.
It might almost be said that the reconciliation was not consummated till
the day when the heir and namesake of Humbert of the White Hands received
the squadrons of Europe in the harbour of Genoa, and the proud republican
city showed what a welcome she had prepared for her sovereign of the Savoy
race.</p>

<p>After the Congress of Vienna finished its labours, there were, as has
been remarked, ten states in Italy, but out of Sardinia (whose subjugation
Prince Metternich esteemed a mere matter of time) there was one master.
The authority of the Emperor Francis was practically as undisputed from
Venice to the Bay of Naples as it was in the Grand Duchy of Austria. The
Austrians garrisoned Piacenza, Ferrara and <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg.16]</a></span> Commacchio; Austrian princes
reigned in Tuscany, Parma, Modena and Lucca; the King of Naples, who paid
Austria twenty-six million francs for getting back his throne, thankfully
agreed to support a German army to protect him against his subjects. In
the secret treaty concluded between himself and the Emperor of Austria, it
was stipulated that the King of the Two Sicilies should not introduce into
his government any principles irreconcilable with those adopted by His
Imperial Majesty in the government of his Italian provinces. As for the
Roman States, Austria reckoned on her influence in always securing the
election of a Pope who would give her no trouble. Seeing herself without
rivals and all-powerful, she deemed her position unassailable. She forgot
that, by giving Italy an unity of misery, she was preparing the way for
another unity. Common hatred engendered common love; common sufferings led
on to a common effort. If some prejudices passed away under the Napoleonic
rule, many more still remained, and possibly, to eradicate so old an evil,
no cure less drastic than universal servitude would have sufficed.
Italians felt for the first time what before only the greatest among them
had felt&mdash;that they were brothers in one household, children of one
mother whom they were bound to redeem. Jealousies and millennial feuds
died out; the intense municipal spirit which, imperfect as it was, had yet
in it precious political germs, widened into patriotism. Italy was
re-born.</p>

<p>Black, however, was the present outlook. Total commercial stagnation
and famine increased the sentiment of unmitigated hopelessness which
spread through the land. The poet Monti, who, alas! sang for bread the
festival songs of the Austrians as he had sung those of Napoleon, said
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg.17]</a></span> in
private to an Englishman who asked him why he did not give his voice to
the liberties of his country which he desired, though he did not expect to
see them: 'It would be <i>vox clamantis in deserto</i>; besides, how can
the grievances of Italy be made known? No one dares to
write&mdash;scarcely to think&mdash;politics; if truth is to be told, it
must be told by the English; England is the only tribunal yet open to the
complaints of Europe.' A greater poet and nobler man, Ugo Foscolo, had but
lately uttered a wail still more despondent: 'Italy will soon be nothing
but a lifeless carcass, and her generous sons should only weep in silence
without the impotent complaints and mutual recriminations of slaves.' That
as patriotic a heart as ever beat should have been afflicted to this point
by the canker of despair tells of the quagmire&mdash;not only political
but spiritual&mdash;into which Italy was sunk. The first thing needful was
to restore the people to consciousness, to animation of some sort, it did
not matter what, so it were a sign of life. Foscolo himself, who impressed
on what he wrote his own proud and scornful temperament, almost savage in
its independence, fired his countrymen to better things than the
despairing inertia which he preached. Few works have had more effect than
his <i>Letters of Jacobo Ortis</i>. As often happens with books which
strongly move contemporaries, the reader may wonder now what was the
secret of its power, but if the form and sentiment of the Italian <i>
Werther</i> strike us as antiquated, the intense, though melancholy
patriotism that pervades it explains the excitement it caused when
patriotism was a statutory offence. Such mutilated copies as were allowed
to pass by the censor were eagerly sought; the young read it, women read
it&mdash;who so rarely read&mdash;the mothers of the fighters of <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg.18]</a></span>
to-morrow. Foscolo's life gave force to his words: when all were
flattering Napoleon, he had reminded him that no man can be rightly
praised till he is dead, and that his one sure way of winning the praise
of posterity was to establish the independence of Italy. The warning was
contained in a 'discourse' which Foscolo afterwards printed with the motto
from Sophocles: 'My soul groans for my country, for myself and for thee.'
Sooner than live under the Austrians, he went into voluntary exile, and
finally took refuge in England, where he was the <i>f&ecirc;ted</i> lion
of a season, and then forgotten, and left almost without the necessaries
of life. No one was much to blame; Foscolo was born to misunderstand and
to be misunderstood; he hid himself to hide his poverty, which, had it
been known, might have been alleviated. His individual tragedy seemed a
part of the universal tragedy.</p>

<p>With Foscolo, his literary predecessor Alfieri must be mentioned as
having helped in rekindling the embers, of patriotic feeling, because,
though dead, he spoke; and his plays, one of which was prophetically
dedicated <i>al libero Popolo Italiano</i>, had never been so much read.
The <i>Misogallo</i>, published for the first time after the fall of
Napoleon, though aimed at the French, served equally well as an onslaught
on every foreign dominion or even moral or intellectual influence. 'Shall
<i>we</i> learn liberty of the Gauls, <i>we</i> who taught every lofty
thing to others?' was a healthy remonstrance to a race that had lost faith
in itself; and the Austrians were wise in discountenancing the sale of a
work that contained the line which gave a watchword to the
future:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
       <i>Schiavi or siam si; ma schiavi almen frementi</i>.
</pre>

<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg.19]</a></span>

<p>Like Foscolo's, Alfieri's life was a lesson in independence: angry at
the scant measure of freedom in Piedmont, he could never be induced to go
near his sovereign till Charles Emmanuel was staying at Florence as a
proscript. Then the poet went to pay his respects to him, and was received
with the good-humoured banter: 'Well, Signor Conte, here am I, a king, in
the condition you would like to see them all.'</p>

<p>Against the classical, not to say pagan, leanings of these two poets, a
reaction set in with Alessandro Manzoni, the founder of Italian
Romanticism, to which he gave an aspect differing from that which the same
movement wore in France, because he was an ardent Catholic at a time when
Christianity had almost the charm of novelty. His religious outpourings
combine the fervour of the Middle Ages with modern expansion, and he freed
the Italian language from pedantic restrictions without impairing its
dignity. It was once the fashion to inveigh against Manzoni for, as it was
said, inculcating resignation; but he did nothing of the kind. As a young
man he had sung of the Italians as 'Figli tutti d'un solo Riscatto,' and
though he was not of those who fight either with the sword or the pen, yet
that 'Riscatto' was the dream of his youth and manhood, and the joy of his
old age. His gentleness was never contaminated by servility, and the love
for his country, profound if placid, which appears in every line of his
writings, appealed to a class that could not be reached by fiery
turbulence of thought.</p>

<p>In an age when newspapers have taken the place of books, it may seem
strange to ascribe any serious effect to the works of poets and
romancists; but in the Italy of that date there were no newspapers to
speak of; the ordinary channels of opinion were blocked up. Books were
still not only read, but discussed and thought over, and every slight
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg.20]</a></span>
allusion to the times was instantly applied. In the prevailing
listlessness, the mere fact of increased mental activity was of
importance. A spark of genius does much to raise a nation. It is in itself
the incontrovertible proof that the race lives: a dead people does not
produce men of genius. Whatever awakes one part of the intelligence reacts
on all its parts. You cannot lift, any more than you can degrade, the
heart of man piecemeal. In this sense not literature only but also music
helped, who can say how effectually, to bring Italy back to life. The land
was refreshed by a flood of purely national song, full of the laughter and
the tears of Italian character, of the sunshine and the storms of Italian
nature. Music, the only art uncageable as the human soul, descended as a
gift from heaven upon the people whose articulate utterance was stifled.

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>THE WORK OF THE CARBONARI</h4>

<h5>1815-1821</h5>

<h5>Revolutions in the Kingdom of Naples and in Piedmont&mdash;The
Conspiracy against Charles Albert.</h5>

<br />


<p>Considering what the state of the country was after 1815, and how
apparently inexhaustible were the resources of the Empire of which the
petty princes of the peninsula were but puppets, it is remarkable that
political agitation, with a view to reversing the decisions of Vienna,
should have begun so soon, and on so large a scale. Not that the nation,
as a whole, was yet prepared to move; every revolution, till 1848, was
partial in the sense that the mass of the people stood aloof, because
unconvinced of the possibility of loosening their chains. But, during that
long succession of years, the number of Italians ready to embark on
enterprises of the most desperate character, accounting as nothing the
smallness of the chance of success, seems enormous when the risks they ran
and the difficulties they faced are fully recognised. Among the means
which were effective in first rousing Italy from her lethargy, and in
fostering the will to acquire her independence at all costs, the secret
society of the Carbonari undoubtedly occupies the front rank. The
Carbonari acted in two ways; by what they did and by what they caused to
be done by others who were outside their society, and perhaps unfavourable
to it, <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">
[Pg.22]</a></span> but who were none the less sensible of the pressure it
exercised. The origin of Carbonarism has been sought in vain; as a
specimen of the childish fables that once passed for its history may be
noticed the legend that Francis I. of France once stumbled on a charcoal
burner's hut when hunting 'on the frontiers of his kingdom next to
Scotland,' and was initiated into the rites similar to those in use among
the sectaries of the nineteenth century. Those rites referred to vengeance
which was to be taken on the wolf that slew the lamb; the wolf standing
for tyrants and oppressors, and the lamb for Jesus Christ, the sinless
victim, by whom all the oppressed were represented. The Carbonari
themselves generally believed that they were heirs to an organisation
started in Germany before the eleventh century, under the name of the
Faith of the Kohlen-Brenners, of which Theobald de Brie, who was
afterwards canonised, was a member. Theobald was adopted as patron saint
of the modern society, and his fancied portrait figured in all the lodges.
That any weight should have been attached to these pretensions to
antiquity may appear strange to us, as it certainly did not matter whether
an association bent on the liberation of Italy had or had not existed in
German forests eight hundred years before; age and mystery, however, have
a great popular attraction, the first as an object of reverence, the
second as food for curiosity with the profane, and a bond of union among
the initiated. The religious symbolism of the Carbonari, their oaths and
ceremonies, and the axes, blocks and other furniture of the initiatory
chamber, were well calculated to impress the poorer and more ignorant and
excitable of the brethren. The Vatican affected to believe that
Carbonarism was an offshoot of Freemasonry, but, in spite of sundry points
of <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg.23]</a></span>
resemblance, such as the engagements of mutual help assumed by members,
there seems to have been no real connection between the two. Political
Freemasonry remained somewhat of an exotic in Italy, and was inclined to
regard France as its centre. As far as can be ascertained, it gave a
general support to Napoleon, while Carbonarism rejected every foreign
yoke. The practical aims of the Carbonari may be summed up in two words:
freedom and independence. From the first they had the penetration to grasp
the fact that independence, even if obtained, could not be preserved
without freedom; but though their predilections were theoretically
republican, they did not make a particular form of government a matter of
principle. Nor were they agreed in a definite advocacy of the unity of
Italy.</p>

<p>A Genoese of the name of Malghella, who was Murat's Minister of Police,
was the first person to give a powerful impetus to Carbonarism, of which
he has even been called the inventor, but the inference goes too far.
Malghella ended miserably; after the fall of Murat he was arrested by the
Austrians, who consigned him as a new subject to the Sardinian Government,
which immediately put him in prison. His name is hardly known, but no
Italian of his time worked more assiduously, or in some respects more
intelligently, for the emancipation of Italy. Whatever was truly Italian
in Murat's policy must be mainly attributed to him. As early as 1813 he
urged the King to declare himself frankly for independence, and to grant a
constitution to his Neapolitan subjects. But Malghella did not find the
destined saviour of Italy in Murat; his one lasting work was to establish
Carbonarism on so strong a basis that, when the Bourbons returned, there
were thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Carbonari in all parts of
the realm. The discovery was not a pleasant one to the restored rulers,
and the Prince of Canosa, the new Minister <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg.24]</a></span> of Police, thought to counteract
the evil done by his predecessor by setting up an abominable secret
society called the Calderai del Contrapeso (Braziers of the Counterpoise),
principally recruited from the refuse of the people, lazzaroni, bandits
and let-out convicts, who were provided by Government with 20,000 muskets,
and were sworn to exterminate all enemies of the Church of Rome, whether
Jansenists, Freemasons or Carbonari. This association committed some
horrible excesses, but otherwise it had no results. The Carbonari closed
in their ranks, and learnt to observe more strictly their rules of
secrecy. From the kingdom of Naples, Carbonarism spread to the Roman
states, and found a congenial soil in Romagna, which became the focus
whence it spread over the rest of Italy. It was natural that it should
take the colour, more or less, of the places where it grew. In Romagna,
where political assassination is in the blood of the people, a dagger was
substituted for the symbolical woodman's axe in the initiatory rites. It
was probably only in Romagna that the conventional threat against
informers was often carried out. The Romagnols invested Carbonarism with
the wild intensity of their own temperament, resolute even to crime, but
capable of supreme impersonal enthusiasm. The ferment of expectancy that
prevailed in Romagna is reflected in the Letters and Journals of Lord
Byron, whom young Count Pietro Gamba made a Carbonaro, and who looked
forward to seeing the Italians send the barbarians of all nations back to
their own dens, as to the most interesting spectacle and moment in
existence. His lower apartments, he writes, were full of the bayonets,
fusils and cartridges of his Carbonari cronies; 'I suppose that they
consider me <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">
[Pg.25]</a></span> as a d&eacute;p&ocirc;t, to be sacrificed in case of
accidents. It is no great matter, supposing that Italy could be liberated,
who or what is sacrificed. It is a grand object&mdash;the very poetry of
politics. Only think&mdash;free Italy!!! Why, there has been nothing like
it since the days of Augustus.'</p>

<p>The movement on which such great hopes were set was to begin in the
kingdom of Naples in the spring of 1820. The concession of the hard-won
Spanish Constitution in the month of March encouraged the Neapolitans to
believe that they might get a like boon from their own King if they
directed all the forces at their command to this single end. To avoid
being compromised, they sought rather to dissociate themselves from the
patriots of other parts of Italy than to co-operate with them in an united
effort. The Carbonari of the Neapolitan kingdom, who were the entire
authors of the revolution, which, after many unfortunate delays, broke out
on the 1st of July, had good cause for thinking that they were in a
position to dictate terms; the mistake they made was to suppose that a
charter conceded by a Bourbon of Naples could ever be worth the paper on
which it was written. Not only among the people, but in the army the
Carbonari had thousands of followers on whom they could rely, and several
whole regiments were only waiting their orders to rise in open revolt. The
scheme was to take possession of the persons of the King and the royal
family, and retain them as hostages till the Constitution was granted.
Such extreme measures were not necessary. The standard of rebellion was
raised at Monteforte by two officers named Morelli and Silvati, who had
brought over a troop of cavalry from Nola, and by the priest Menechini. In
all Neapolitan insurrections there was sure to be a priest; the Neapolitan
Church, much though there is to be laid to its account, must be admitted
to have frequently shown sympathy with the <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg.26]</a></span> popular side. Menechini enjoyed
an immense, if brief, popularity which he used to allay the anger of the
mob and to procure the safety of obnoxious persons. The King sent two
generals and a body of troops against the Chartists, but when the
Carbonari symbols were recognised on the insurgent flags, the troops
showed such clear signs of wishing to go over to the enemy that they were
quietly taken back to Naples. The cry of 'God, the King, and the
Constitution,' was taken up through the land; General Pepe, who had long
been a Carbonaro in secret, was enthusiastically hailed as commander of
the Chartist forces, which practically comprised the whole army. The King
was powerless; besides which, when pushed up into any corner people who do
not mind breaking their word have a facility for hard swearing. On the
13th of July, Ferdinand standing at the altar of the royal chapel, with
his hand on the Bible, swore to defend and maintain the Constitution which
he had just granted. If he failed to do so, he called upon his subjects to
disobey him, and God to call him to account. These words he read from a
written form; as if they were not enough, he added, with his eyes on the
cross, and his face turned towards heaven: 'Omnipotent God, who with Thine
infinite power canst read the soul of man and the future, do Thou, if I
speak falsely, or intend to break my oath, at this moment direct the
thunder of Thy vengeance on my head.'</p>

<p>The Neapolitans had got their liberties, but they soon found themselves
face to face with perplexities which would have taxed the powers of men
both wiser and more experienced in free government than they were. In the
first place, although a revolution may be made by a sect, a government
cannot be carried on by one. The Carbonari who had <span class="newpage">
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg.27]</a></span> won the day were blind
to this self-evident truth; and, to make matters worse, there was a split
in their party, some of them being disposed to throw off the Bourbon yoke
altogether; a natural desire, but as it was only felt by a minority, it
added to the general confusion. Then came, as it was sure to come, the cry
for separation from Sicily. The Sicilians wanted back the violated
constitution obtained for them by the English in 1812, and would have
nothing to do with that offered them from Naples. In every one of the
struggles between Sicily and Naples, it is impossible to refuse sympathy
to the islanders, who, in the pride of their splendid independent history,
deemed themselves the victims of an inferior race; but it is equally
impossible to ignore that, politically, they were in the wrong. In union,
and in union alone, lay the only chance of resisting the international
plot to keep the South Italian populations in perpetual bondage. The
Sicilian revolt was put down at first mildly, and finally, as mildness had
no effect, with the usual violence by the Neapolitan Constitutional
Government, which could not avoid losing credit and popularity in the
operation. Meanwhile, the three persons who traded under the name of
Europe met at Troppau, and came readily to the conclusion that 'the
sovereigns of the Holy Alliance exercised an incontestable right in taking
common measures of security against states which the overthrow of
authority by revolt placed in a hostile attitude towards every legitimate
government.' The assumption was too broadly stated, even for Lord
Castlereagh's acceptance; but he was contented to make a gentle protest,
which he further nullified by allowing that, in the present case,
intervention was very likely justified. France expressed no disapproval.
Only the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden and Spain gave the
Constitutional <i>r&eacute;gime</i> tacit <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg.28]</a></span> support by recognising it. The
Emperor of Russia was very anxious to take part in the business, and would
have sent off an army instantly had not his royal brother of Prussia
hesitated to consent to the inconvenience of a Cossack march through his
territory. The work was left, therefore, to the Emperor of Austria. Before
entering upon it, it occurred to these three to invite the King of Naples
to meet them at Laybach. They knew his character.</p>

<p>Ferdinand assured his Parliament that he was going to Laybach solely to
induce the Holy Alliance to think better of its opposition, and to agree,
at least, to all the principal features of the new state of things. Most
foolishly the Parliament, which, according to the Constitution, might have
vetoed his leaving the country, let him go. Before starting he wrote an
open letter to his dear son, the Duke of Calabria, who was appointed
Regent, in which he said: 'I shall defend the events of the past July
before the Congress. I firmly desire the Spanish Constitution for my
kingdom; and although I rely on the justice of the assembled sovereigns,
and on their old friendship, still it is well to tell you that, in
whatever circumstance it may please God to place me, my course will be
what I have manifested on this sheet, strong and unchangeable either by
force or by the flattery of others.'</p>

<p>Brave words! News came in due time of the sequel. On the 9th of
February 1821, the Regent received a letter from the King, in which he
gave the one piece of advice that the people should submit to their fate
quietly. He was coming back with 50,000 Austrians, and a Russian army was
ready to start if wanted. Nevertheless, to prevent a sudden outbreak
before the foreign troops arrived, the Regent carried on a game of
duplicity to the last, and pretended to second, whilst he <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg.29]</a></span> really
baulked, the preparations for resistance decreed by Parliament. Baron
Poerio, the father of two patriot martyrs of the future, sustained the
national dignity by urging Parliament to yield only to force, and to defy
the barbarous horde which was bearing down on the country. The closing
scene is soon told. On the 7th of March, in the mountains near Rieti,
General Guglielmo Pepe, with 8000 regular troops and a handful of militia,
encountered an overwhelmingly superior force of Austrians. The Neapolitans
stood out well for six hours, but on the Austrian reserves coming up, they
were completely routed, and obliged to fly in all directions.</p>

<p>'Order reigned' in the kingdom of Naples. In Sicily, a gallant attempt
at insurrection was begun, but there was not the spirit to go on with it,
and General Rossaroll, its initiator, had to fly to Spain. The afterpiece
is what might have been expected; an insensate desire for vengeance got
hold of Ferdinand, and the last years of his life were spent in hunting
down his enemies, real or imaginary. Morelli and Silvati were hung, the
fugitives, Pepe and Rossaroll, were condemned to death, but this was only
the beginning. The Austrian commander counselled mercy, but in this
respect the King showed an independent mind. A court-martial was
instituted to examine the conduct of ecclesiastics, public functionaries
and soldiers, from the year 1793 downwards. No one was safe who had
expressed a dislike of absolutism within the last thirty years. A
blameless gentleman who was a Carbonaro, was conducted through Naples on
the back of an ass, and beaten with a whip, to which nails were attached.
Eight hundred persons are said to have perished at the hands of the state
in one year. Ferdinand himself expired on the 3rd of January 1825, after
misgoverning for sixty-five years.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg.30]</a></span>

<p>The Neapolitan revolution had just collapsed, when another broke out in
Piedmont, which, though short in duration, was to have far-reaching
consequences.</p>

<p>At that time, the King of Sardinia was Victor Emmanuel I., who
succeeded his brother Charles Emmanuel in 1802, when the latter abdicated
and retired to Rome, where he joined the Society of Jesus. Victor
Emmanuel's only son was dead, and the throne would devolve on his youngest
brother, Charles Felix, Duke of Genoa, whom reasons of state led to
abandon the wish to become a monk, which he had formed as a boy of eleven,
on being taken to visit a convent near Turin. But Charles Felix, though
married, was without children, and the legitimate heir-presumptive was
Charles Albert, Prince of Carignano, who represented the younger branch of
the family, which divided from the main line in the early part of the
seventeenth century. Charles Albert's father was the luckless Prince
Charles of Carignano, who, alone of his house, came to terms with
Napoleon, who promised him a pension, which was not paid. His mother, a
Saxon Princess, paraded the streets of Turin, dressed in the last
republican fashion, with her infant son in her arms. Afterwards, she gave
him a miscellaneous education, that included a large dose of Rousseau from
a Swiss professor. The boy was shifted from place to place, happier when
his mother forgot him, than when, in temporary recollection of his
existence, she called him to her. Once when he was travelling with the
Princess and her second husband, M. de Montl&eacute;art, Charles Albert
was made to sit on the box of the carriage, in a temperature many degrees
below zero.</p>

<p>His uncles (as the King and Charles Felix called themselves, though
they were his cousins) heard with natural horror of the vagaries of <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg.31]</a></span> the
Princess of Carignano, and they extended their antipathy from the mother
to the son, even when he was a child. In Victor Emmanuel, this antipathy
was moderated by the easy good-nature of his character; in Charles Felix,
it degenerated into an intense hatred.</p>

<p>It is a singular thing that Prince Metternich, from the very first, had
an instinctive feeling that the unfortunate boy, who seemed the most
hopeless and helpless of human creatures, would prove the evil genius of
the Austrian power. He therefore set to work to deprive him of his
eventual rights. He was confident of success, as fortune had arranged
matters in a manner that offered a ready-made plan for carrying out the
design. Victor Emmanuel had four daughters, precluded from reigning by the
Salic law, which was in force in Piedmont. His wife, the Queen Maria
Teresa, a woman of great beauty and insatiable ambition, was sister to the
Austrian Archduke Francis d'Este, Duke of Modena. Francis had never
married, having been robbed of his intended bride, the Archduchess
Marie-Louise, by her betrothal to Napoleon. What simpler than to marry the
eldest of the Sardinian princesses to her uncle, abrogate the Salic law,
and calmly await the desired consummation of an Austrian prince, by right
of his wife, occupying the Sardinian throne?</p>

<p>The first step was soon taken; princesses came into the world to be
sacrificed. The plot ran on for some time, the Queen, who was in the habit
of calling Charles Albert 'that little vagrant,' giving it her
indefatigable support. Victor Emmanuel was weak, and stood in considerable
awe of his wife, who had obtained a great ascendancy over him in the
miserable days of their residence in the island of Sardinia. His nephew,
who was almost or wholly unknown to him, partook <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg.32]</a></span> of the nature of a
disagreeable myth. Nevertheless he had a sense of justice, as well as
Savoy blood, in his veins&mdash;he resisted; but the day came when his
surrender seemed probable. Just at that moment, however, the Duke of
Modena prematurely revealed the project by asking through his
representative at the Congress of Vienna for the port of Spezia, in order
that he might conveniently connect his own state with his prospective
possession, the island of Sardinia. Prince Talleyrand was alarmed by the
vision of Austria supreme in the Mediterranean, and through his opposition
the conspiracy, for the time, was upset, and the rights of Charles Albert
were recognised.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Prince Metternich had insisted on the young Prince,
then seventeen, visiting the headquarters of the Allies. Charles Felix
(who was unconnected with the Modena scheme) wrote a letter to the King on
this subject, in which he stated it as his belief that the Austrian plan
was to get Charles Albert accidentally killed, or to plunge him in vice,
or to make him contract a discreditable marriage. This was why they had
invited him to their camp. He adds the characteristic remark that their
nephew would be in no less danger at the headquarters of the Duke of
Wellington '&agrave; cause de la religion.' Have him home and have him
married, is his advice. 'We are well treated, because there is the
expectation of soon devouring our remains by extinguishing the House of
Savoy. It is the habit of the cabinet of Vienna; it was thus they made an
end of the House of Este.'</p>

<p>These counsels were the more likely to impress Victor Emmanuel from his
knowledge that they were inspired by no shadow of personal interest in
'the little vagrant,' but by the race-feeling alone. The Queen contrived
to prevent the immediate recall of the Prince of <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg.33]</a></span> Carignano, but she was
obliged to give way, and he was definitely established in Piedmont. In
1818 he was married at Florence to the Archduchess Maria Teresa of
Tuscany, who, on the 14th of March 1820, gave birth to the child that was
to become the first King of Italy.</p>

<p>Very soon after his return to his country, the hopes of the Liberal
party began to centre in the young Prince, whom some of their more ardent
spirits already saluted as the rising sun. Those who made his acquaintance
were fascinated by the charm of manner which he could always exert when he
chose, and were confirmed in their hopes by his evident susceptibility to
the magnetism of new ideas and fatalistic ambitions. What they did not
perceive was, that in his nature lay that ingrained tendency to drift
before the wind, which is the most dangerous thing in politics. In the
mid-sea of events he might change his course without conscious
insincerity, but with the self-abandonment of a mind which, under
pressure, loses the sense of personal responsibility.</p>

<p>In Piedmont, Carbonarism had made great way among the upper classes and
among the younger officers; the flower of the country was enrolled in its
ranks, and the impatience to take some action towards procuring free
institutions for themselves, and doing something for their Lombard
brothers, had reached fever heat in the spring of 1821, when the affairs
of Naples were creating much excitement. The principal conspirators, noble
young men, full of unselfish ardour, were the chosen friends and
companions of the Prince of Carignano. It was formerly the opinion that
they made him the confidant of their plans from the first, that he was one
of them, in short&mdash;a Carbonaro bound by all the oaths and obligations
of the society. The judgment of his conduct afterwards is, of course, much
affected by this point; were <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_34" id=
"Page_34">[Pg.34]</a></span> the assumption correct, the invectives
launched against him, not by any means only by republican writers, would
hardly seem excessive. But by the light of documents issued in recent
times, it appears more just as well as more charitable to suppose that
Charles Albert's complicity was of a much less precise character. A little
encouragement from a prince goes a long way.</p>

<p>According to his own account, he was taken by surprise when, on the and
or 3rd of March, his friends Carail, Collegno, Santa Rosa and Lisio came
to tell him in secret that they belonged to societies which had been long
working for the independence of Italy, and that they reckoned on him,
knowing well his affection for his country, to aid them in obtaining from
the King some few first concessions, which would be the prelude of a
glorious future. It is clear that he ought either to have broken with them
altogether from that moment or to have cast his lot with them for good or
evil. He tried a middle course. He induced the conspirators to put off the
revolution by which they intended to enforce their demands, and he
conveyed to the King information of what had happened, asking at the same
time that no measures should be taken against incriminated persons.</p>

<p>In fact, no precautions of any kind seem to have been taken. Victor
Emmanuel, frightened at first, was soon reassured. The revolution, which
was to have begun on the 8th, actually broke out on the 10th of March at
Alessandria, where the counter orders issued at Charles. Albert's request,
after the interview just described, were not obeyed. The garrison
'pronounced' in favour of the Spanish Constitution. It was now impossible
to draw back. From Alessandria the revolution spread to the capital. The
bulk of the army sympathised with the movement, and relied on the support
of the people. <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">
[Pg.35]</a></span> The greatest ladies mixed with the crowds which
gathered under the Carbonaro flag&mdash;black, blue and red. On the other
hand, there were a few devoted servants of the House of Savoy who beheld
these novelties with the sensations of a quiet person who sees from his
window the breaking loose of a menagerie. Invincibly ignorant of all that
was really inspiring in this first breath of freedom, they saw nothing in
it but an unwarrantable attack on the authority of their amiable, if weak,
old King, for whom they would gladly have shed every drop of their
blood&mdash;not from the rational esteem which the people of Italy, like
the people of England, now feel for their sovereign, but from the pure
passion of loyalty which made the cavalier stand blindly by his prince,
whether he was good or bad, in the right or in the wrong. Men of their
type watched the evolution of Piedmont into Italy from first to last with
the same presentiment of evil, the same moral incapacity of appreciation.
A handful of these loyal servitors hurried to Victor Emmanuel to offer
their assistance. They marshalled their troop in battle-array in the
courtyard of the palace. Their arms were antiquated pistols and rapiers,
and they themselves were veterans, some of them of eighty years, mounted
on steeds as ancient. The King thanked them, but declined their services;
nor would he give <i>carte blanche</i> to Captain Raimondi, who assured
him that with his one company he could suppress the insurrection if
invested with full powers. Soon after this refusal, a firing of guns
announced that the citadel was in the hands of the insurgents. The troops
within and without fraternised; it was a fine moment for those who knew
history and who were bent in their hearts on driving the foreigner out of
Italy. Here at the citadel of Turin, during the siege of 1706, occurred
the memorable deed of Pietro Micca, the peasant-soldier, who, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg.36]</a></span> when he heard
the enemy thundering at the door of the gallery, thought life and the
welcome of wife and child and the happy return to his village of less
account than duty, and fired the mine which sent him and three companies
of French Grenadiers to their final reckoning.</p>

<p>After vacillating for two or three days, Victor Emmanuel abdicated on
the 13th of March. The Queen desired to be appointed regent, but, to her
intense vexation, the appointment was given to Charles Albert. A more
unenviable honour never fell to the lot of man.</p>

<p>Deserted by the ministers of the crown, who resigned in a body, alone
in the midst of a triumphant revolution, appealed to in the name of those
sentiments of patriotism which he could never hear invoked unmoved, the
young Prince uttered the words which were as good as a surrender: 'I, too,
am an Italian!' That evening he allowed the Spanish Constitution to be
proclaimed subject to the arrival of the orders of the new King.</p>

<p>The new King! No one remembered that there existed such a person. Nor
had anyone recollected that the Spanish Constitution abrogated the Salic
law, and that hence, instead of a new King, they had a new Queen&mdash;the
wife of the Duke of Modena! An eminent Turinese jurisconsulist, who was
probably the only possessor of a copy of the charter in the town which was
screaming itself hoarse for it, divulged this awkward
discovery.&mdash;Several hours were spent in anxious discussion, when the
brilliant suggestion was made that the article should be cancelled. The
article was cancelled.</p>

<p>But Charles Felix could not be disposed of so easily. The news of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg.37]</a></span>
late events reached him at Modena of all places in the world, the
rallying-point of the Prince of Carignano's bitterest foes. He was not
long in sending his orders. He repudiated everything that had been done,
and commanded Charles Albert, 'if he had a drop of our royal blood left in
his veins,' to leave the capital instantly for Novara, where he was to
await his further instructions.</p>

<p>Charles Albert obeyed. He was accompanied on his journey&mdash;or, as
it may be called, his flight&mdash;by such of the troops as remained
loyal. At Novara he found a sentence of exile, in a fresh order, to quit
Piedmontese territory. Tuscany was indicated as the state where he was to
reside.</p>

<p>The Austrians crossed the frontier with the consent of the King.
Charles Felix's opinion of Austria has been already given; another time he
said: 'Austria is a sort of bird-lime which, if you get it on your
fingers, you can never rub off.' If anything was needed to increase his
loathing for the revolution, it was the necessity in which it placed him,
as he thought, of calling in this unloved ally. But Charles Felix was not
the man to hesitate. Not caring a straw for the privilege of wearing a
crown himself, his belief in the divine right of kings, and the obligation
to defend it, amounted to monomania. The Austrian offer was therefore
accepted. On her part Austria declined the obliging proposal of the Czar
of a loan of 100,000 men. She felt that she could do the work unaided, nor
was she mistaken.</p>

<p>On the 8th of April the Constitutionalist troops which marched towards
Novara, sanguine that the loyal regiments there quartered would end by
joining them, were met by an armed resistance, in which the newly-arrived
Austrians assisted. Their defeat was complete, and it was the signal of
the downfall of the revolution. The leaders retired <span class="newpage">
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg.38]</a></span> from Turin to
Alessandria, and thence to Genoa, that had risen last and was last to
submit. Thus most of them escaped by sea, which was fortunate, as Charles
Felix had the will to establish a White Terror, and was only prevented by
the circumstance that nearly all the proposed victims were outside his
kingdom. Capital sentences were sent after them by the folio: there was
hardly a noble family which had not one of its members condemned to death.
When his brother, Victor Emmanuel, recommended mercy, he told him that he
was entirely ready to give him back the crown, but that, while he reigned,
he should reign after his own ideas. He seems to have had thoughts of
hanging the Prince of Carignano, and for a long time he seriously meant to
devise the kingdom to his son, the infant Prince Victor. Thus a new set of
obstacles arose between Charles Albert and the throne.</p>

<p>Of the personal friends of that ill-starred Prince all escaped. One of
them, the noble-minded Count Santorre di Santa Rosa, died fighting for
liberty in Greece. In the miseries of exile and poverty he had never lost
faith in his country, but fearlessly maintained that 'the emancipation of
Italy was an event of the nineteenth century.' To another, Giacinta di
Collegno, it was reserved to receive the dying breath of Charles Albert,
when as an exiled and crownless king he found rest, at last, at
Oporto.</p>

<p>There were deeper reasons than any which appear on the surface for the
failure of the revolutionary movements of this period. North and south,
though the populations exhibited a childish delight at the overthrow of
the old, despotic form of government, their effervescence ended as rapidly
as it began. They did not really understand what was going on.
'By-the-bye, what <i>is</i> this same constitution they are making such a
noise about?' asked a lazzarone who had been shouting <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg.39]</a></span> 'Viva la
Costituzione' all the day. Within a few weeks of the breakdown at Novara,
Count Confalonieri wrote wisely to Gino Capponi that revolutions are not
made by high intelligences, but by the masses which are moved by
enthusiasm, and for a possibility of success, the word Constitution, the
least magical of words, should have been replaced by the more
comprehensible and stirring call: 'War to the stranger.' But this, instead
of sounding from every housetop, was purposely stifled at Naples, and kept
a mysterious secret in Piedmont.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h4>PRISON AND SCAFFOLD</h4>

<h5>1821-1831</h5>

<h5>Political Trials in Venetia and Lombardy&mdash;Risings in the South
and Centre&mdash;Ciro Menotti.</h5>

<br />


<p>The Austrians fully expected a rising in Lombardy in the middle of
March, and that they were not without serious fears as to its consequences
is proved by the preparations which they quietly made to abandon Milan, if
necessary. The Court travelling-carriages were got ready, and the younger
princes were sent away. Carbonarism had been introduced into Lombardy the
year before by two Romagnols, Count Laderchi and Pietro Maroncelli. It was
their propaganda that put the Austrian Government on the alert, and was
the cause of the Imperial decree which denounced the society as a
subversive conspiracy, aiming at the destruction of all constituted
authority, and pointed to death and confiscation of property as the
penalty for joining it. There was the additional clause, destined to bear
terrible fruit, which declared accomplices, punishable with
life-imprisonment, all who knew of the existence of lodges
(<i>Vendite</i>, as they were called) or the names of associates, without
informing the police. In the autumn of 1820, Maroncelli and many others,
including Silvio Pellico, the young Piedmontese poet, were arrested as
Carbonari, while the arrest of the so-called accomplices began with Count
Giovanni Arrivabene of Mantua, who had no connection with the society, but
was charged with having heard from Pellico that he was a member. Pellico
and his companions <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">
[Pg.41]</a></span> were still lying untried in the horrible Venetian
prisons, called, from their leaden roofs, the 'Piombi,' when the events of
1821 gave rise to a wholesale batch of new arrests. As soon as they knew
of a movement in Piedmont, the Lombard patriots prepared to co-operate in
it; that they were actually able to do nothing, was because it broke out
prematurely, and also, to some extent, because their head, Count
Confalonieri, was incapacitated by severe illness. But though their
activity profited not at all to the cause, it was fatal to themselves. The
Austrian Government had, as has been stated, a correct general notion of
what was going on, but at the beginning it almost entirely lacked proofs
which could inculpate individuals. In the matter of arrests, however,
there was one sovereign rule which all the despotic Governments in Italy
could and did follow in every emergency: it was to lay hands on the most
intelligent, distinguished and upright members of the community. This plan
never failed; these were the patriots, the conspirators of those days. The
second thing which the Austrians made a rule of doing, was to extort from
the prisoners some incautious word, some shadow of an assent or admission
which would place them on the track of other compromised persons, and
furnish them with such scraps of evidence as they deemed sufficient, in
order to proceed against those already in their power. In their secret
examination of prisoners, they had reduced the system of provocative
interrogation to a science. They made use of every subterfuge, and, above
all, of fabricated confessions fathered on friends of the prisoner, to
extract the exclamation, the nod of the head, the confused answer, which
served their purpose. The prisoners, <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg.42]</a></span> men of good faith, and
inexperienced in the arts of deception, were but children in their hands,
and scarcely one of them was not doomed to be the involuntary cause of
some other person's ruin&mdash;generally that of a dear and intimate
friend.</p>

<p>The first to be arrested was Gaetano De-Castillia, who went with the
Marquis Giorgio Pallavicini on a mission to Piedmont while the revolution
there was at its height. They even had an interview with the Prince of
Carignano, 'a pale and tall young man, with a charming expression' (so
Pallavicini describes him), but had obtained from him no assurance, except
the characteristic parting word: 'Let us hope in the future.' When
De-Castillia was arrested, Pallavicini, then a youth of twenty, and full
of noble sentiments, rushed to the director of the police with the avowal:
'It was I who induced De-Castillia to go to Piedmont; if the journey was a
crime, the fault is mine; punish me!' No error could have proved more
calamitous; till that moment the Austrians were in ignorance of the
Piedmontese mission; De-Castillia was arrested on some far more trifling
charge. Pallavicini's generous folly was rewarded by fourteen years'
imprisonment, and its first consequence was the arrest of Count
Confalonieri, at whose instance the visit to Turin had been made. For
months the Austrians had desired to have a clue against him; the
opportunity was come at last.</p>

<p>Federico Confalonieri, brilliant, handsome, persuasive, of great wealth
and ancient lineage, innately aristocratic, but in the best sense, was
morally at the head of Lombardy, by the selection of the fittest, which at
certain junctures makes one man pre-appointed leader while he is still
untried. When in England, the Duke of Sussex prevailed upon him to become
a Freemason, but he was not a Carbonaro <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg.43]</a></span> in the technical sense, though
both friends and foes believed him to be one. He knew, however, more about
this and the other secret societies then existing in Italy&mdash;even
those of the reactionary party&mdash;than did most of the initiated. In an
amusing passage in his memoirs he relates how, when once forcibly detained
in a miserable hostelry in the Calabrian Mountains, a den of brigands, of
whom the chief was the landlord, he guessed that this man was a Calderaio,
and it occurred to him to make the sign of that bloodthirsty sect. Things
changed in a second; the brigand innkeeper was at his feet, the complete
household was set in motion to serve him. In 1821, he founded at Milan,
not a secret society, but an association in which all the best patriots
were enrolled, and of which the sole engagement was the formula, repeated
on entering its ranks: 'I swear to God, and on my honour, to exert myself
to the utmost of my power, and even at the sacrifice of my life, to redeem
Italy from foreign dominion.'</p>

<p>Knowing to what extent he was a marked man, Confalonieri would have
only exercised common prudence in leaving the country, but he could not
reconcile himself to the idea of flight. Anonymous warnings rained upon
him: most likely they all came from the same quarter, from Count Bubna,
the Austrian Field-Marshal, with whom Confalonieri was personally on
friendly terms. On the 12th of December the Countess Bubna made a last
effort to save him; her carriage was ready, she implored him to take it
and escape across the frontier. He refused, and next day he was
arrested.</p>

<p>Austrian legal procedure was slow; the trial of the first Carbonari,
Silvio Pellico and his companions, did not take place till 1822. On the
22nd of February the sentence of death was read to Silvio Pellico in his
Venetian prison, to be commuted to one of fifteen years' <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg.44]</a></span> imprisonment
at Spielberg, a fortress converted into a convict prison in a bleak
position in Moravia. To that rock of sorrow, consecrated for ever by the
sufferings of some of the purest of men, Silvio Pellico and Pietro
Maroncelli, with nine or ten companions, condemned at the same time, were
the first Italians to take the road. Here they remained for the eight
years described by the author of <i>Francesca da Rimini</i>, in <i>Le Mie
Prigioni</i>, a book that served the Italian cause throughout the world.
Even now some Italians are indignant at the spirit of saintly resignation
which breathes upon Silvio Pellico's pages, at the veil which is drawn
over many shocking features in the treatment of the prisoners; they do not
know the tremendous force which such reticence gave his narrative. <i>Le
Mie Prigioni</i> has the reserve strength of a Greek tragedy.</p>

<p>Maroncelli contracted a disease of the leg through the hardships
endured; amputation became necessary, but could not be performed till
permission was received from Vienna&mdash;a detail showing the red-tapism
which governed all branches of the Austrian administration. This patriot
went, after his release, to America, where he died, poor, blind and mad.
Pellico, crushed in soul, devoted his latter years entirely to religion.
Only men of iron fibre could come out as they went in. The Spielberg
prisoners wore chains, and their food was so bad and scanty that they
suffered from continual hunger, with its attendant diseases. Unlike the
thieves and assassins confined in the same fortress, the State prisoners
were given no news of their families. Such was Spielberg, 'a sepulchre
without the peace of the dead.'</p>

<p>The State trials of the Lombard patriots in 1823 resulted in seven
capital sentences on the Milanese, thirteen on the Brescians, and four
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg.45]</a></span> on
the Mantuans. The fate of the other prisoners depended on that of Count
Confalonieri. If the sentence on him were not carried out, the lives at
least of the others might be regarded as safe, since he was looked upon as
the head. It is certain that the authorities, and the Emperor himself, had
the most firm intention of having him executed; the more merciful decision
was solely due to the Countess Confalonieri's journey to Vienna.
Accompanied by the prisoner's aged father, this beautiful and heroic
woman, a daughter of the noble Milanese house of Casati, went to Vienna
before the conclusion of the trial, to be ready for any eventuality. When
the sentence of death was passed, it was announced by the Emperor to old
Count Confalonieri, whom he advised to return with the Countess Teresa as
fast as possible if they wished to see the condemned man alive. Undaunted
by the news, the brave wife sought an interview with the Empress, in whom
she found a warm advocate, but who was obliged to own, after several
attempts to obtain a reprieve, that she despaired of success. Teresa
Confalonieri hurried back to Milan through the bitter winter weather, in
doubt whether she should arrive before the execution had taken place. But
the unceasing efforts of the Empress won the day. The respite was granted
on the 13th of January; life-imprisonment was substituted for death. The
countess sent her husband the pillow which she had bathed with her tears
during her terrible journey; needless to say that it was not given to him.
She died broken-hearted with waiting before he was set at liberty in the
year 1836.</p>

<p>When Count Confalonieri reached Vienna on his way to Spielberg, he was
surprised to find himself installed in a luxurious apartment, with <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg.46]</a></span> three
servants to wait upon him. Though too ill to touch solid food, a sumptuous
breakfast and dinner were daily set before him; and but for the constant
jingle of his chains, he would have thought himself in a first-class hotel
on a journey of pleasure. The object of these attentions was clear when
one evening Prince Metternich came to see him, and stayed for three hours,
endeavouring by every exquisite flattery, by every promise and persuasion,
to worm out of him the secrets of which he alone was believed to be the
depositary. The Austrian Government had spent &pound;60,000 on the Milan
Commission, and, practically, they were no wiser than when it began. Would
Confalonieri enlighten them? Whatever scruples he might have felt during
the trial could be now laid aside; there was no question of new arrests.
It was from pure, abstract love of knowledge that the Government, or,
rather, the Emperor, desired to get at the truth. If he preferred to open
his mind to the Emperor in person, His Majesty would grant him a secret
audience. Above all, what was the real truth about the Prince of
Carignano?</p>

<p>All the rest was a blind; it was the wish to have some damnatory
evidence against Charles Albert, such as would for ever exclude him from
the throne, that had induced the Emperor and his astute minister to make
this final attempt.</p>

<p>'Confalonieri need never go to Spielberg,' said the Prince; 'let him
think of his family, of his adored wife, of his own talents, of his future
career, which was on the brink of being blotted out as completely as if he
were dead!' Confalonieri was worthy of his race, of his class, of himself;
he stood firm, and next morning, almost with a sense of relief, he started
for the living grave.</p>

<p>'The struggle was decided,' Prince Metternich had said in the course
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg.47]</a></span> of
the interview, 'and decided not only for our own, but for many
generations. Those who still hoped to the contrary were madmen.'</p>

<p>Some years of outward quiet doubtless confirmed him in the first
opinion, while the second was not likely to be shaken by the next attempt
that was made to take up arms for freedom. On the 28th of June 1828,
several villages in the province of Salerno rose in obedience to the
harangues of two patriotic ecclesiastics, Canon de Luca and Carlo da
Celle, superior of a capuchin convent. This was meant to develop into a
general insurrection, but it was nowhere followed up, and the sword of
vengeance fell speedily on the wretched villagers. Surrounded by the royal
troops, they were forced into submission, many were shot on the spot,
others were dragged in chains to Salerno, not even a drop of water being
allowed them during the journey under the scorching sun. The village of
Bosco was rased to the ground. The priest, the monk, and twenty-two
insurgents were shot after the repression. The heads of the victims were
cut off and placed in iron cages where their wives or mothers were likely
to see them. A woman went to Naples to beg for the pardon of her two
grandsons, by name Diego and Emilio. The King, with barbarous clemency,
told her to choose one. In vain she entreated that if both could not be
saved the choice should be left to chance, or decided by someone else. But
no; unless she chose they would both be shot. At last she chose Diego.
Afterwards she went mad, and was constantly heard wailing: 'I have killed
my grandson Emilio.' This anecdote gives a fair notion of Francis I.,
whose short reign was, however, less signalised by acts of cruelty, though
there were enough of these, than by a venality never surpassed. The
grooms-in-waiting and ladies-of-the-bedchamber sold the public offices
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg.48]</a></span> in
the daylight; and the King, who was aware of it, thought it a subject for
vulgar jokes with his intimates. Francis died in 1830 of bad humour at the
Paris revolution, and was succeeded by Ferdinand II., to be known
hereafter as Bomba&mdash;then a clownish youth, one of whose first kingly
cares was to create St Ignatius Loyola a Field-Marshal.</p>

<p>The revolution which upset the throne of Charles X., and ushered in the
eighteen years' reign of the Citizen King, seemed likely to have momentous
consequences for Italy. The principle of non-intervention proclaimed by
French politicians would, if logically enforced, sound the death-knell of
the Austrian power in Italy. Dupin, the Minister of War, enlarged on the
theme in a speech which appeared to remove all doubt as to the real
intentions of the Government. 'One phrase,' he remarked, 'has made a
general impression; it expresses the true position of a loyal and generous
Government. Not only has the President of the Council laid down the
principle that France should abstain from intervention; he has declared
that she would not tolerate intervention on the part of others. France
might have shut herself up in a cold egotism, and simply said that she
would not intervene; this would have been contemptible, but the
proclamation of not suffering the interventions of others is the noblest
attitude a strong and magnanimous people can assume; it amounts to saying:
Not only will I not attack or disturb other nations, but I, France, whose
voice is respected by Europe and by the whole world, will never permit
others to do so. This is the language held by the ministry and by the
ambassadors of Louis Philippe; and it is this which the army, the National
Guard, France entire, is ready to maintain.'</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg.49]</a></span>

<p>Truly language was invented to travesty the truth, and when French
politicians say they are going to the right it is an almost sure sign that
they are going to the left; nevertheless, is it possible to blame the
Italians who read in these assurances a positive promise affecting their
own case?</p>

<p>The same assurances were repeated again and again through the winter of
1830-31; they were repeated authoritatively as late as March in the latter
year. Well may a French writer inquire: 'Was it insanity or
treachery?'</p>

<p>The good tidings were published by the Italian exiles, who, living
close to the great centres of European politics, were the first to
intoxicate themselves with the great delusion. From London, Gabriele
Rossetti sent the exultant summons:</p>

<pre>
       Cingi l'elmo, la mitra deponi,
       O vetusta Signora del mondo:
       Sorgi, sorgi dal sonno profondo,
       Io son l'alba del nuovo tuo d&igrave;.

      Saran rotte le vostre catene,
     O Fratelli che in ceppi languite;
     O Fratelli che il giogo soffrite
     Calcherete quel giogo col pi&egrave;.
</pre>

<p>The child beside whose cradle the ode was written, was to grow to
manhood while Italy still remained 'the weeping, desolate mother.' The cry
of the poet was not, however, without an echo. In 1831, Romagna, Parma and
Modena rose in rebellion.</p>

<p>Things had been going, without much variation, from bad to worse in the
Roman states, ever since 1815. Pius VII. (Chiaramonti), who died in 1823,
was succeeded by Leo XII. (Genga), an old man who was in such enfeebled
health that his death was expected at the time of his <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg.50]</a></span> election, but,
like a more famous pontiff, he made a sudden recovery, which was
attributed to the act of a prelate, who, in prayer, offered his own life
for the Pope's, and who died a few days after resolving on the sacrifice.
During this Pope's reign, the smallpox was rife in Rome, in consequence of
the suppression of public vaccination. The next conclave, held in 1829,
resulted in the election of Pius VIII. (Castiglioni da Cingoli), who died
on the 30th of November 1830, and was followed by Gregory XVI.
(Cappellari). In each conclave, Austria had secured the choice of a
'Zealot,' as the party afterwards called Ultramontane was then designated.
The last traces of reforms introduced by the French disappeared; criminal
justice was again administered in secret; the police were arbitrary and
irresponsible. All over the Roman states, but especially in Romagna, the
secret society of the Sanfedesti flourished exceedingly; whether, as is
probable, an offshoot of the Calderai or of indigenous growth, its aims
were the same. The affiliated swore to spill the last drop of the blood of
the Liberals, without regard to sex or rank, and to spare neither children
nor old men. Many Romagnols had left their country after the abortive
agitation of 1821, and amongst these were the Gambas. Count Pietro died in
Greece, where he had gone on the service of freedom. Had he lived, this
young man would have been sure to win a fair name in the annals of Italian
patriotism; he should not, as it is, be quite forgotten, as it was chiefly
due to him that Byron's life took the redeeming direction which led to
Missolonghi.</p>

<p>In February 1831, Romagna and the Marches of Ancona threw off the Papal
Government with an ease which must have surprised the most sanguine. The
white, red and green tricolor was hoisted at Bologna, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg.51]</a></span> where, as far
as is known, this combination of colours first became a political badge.
Thirty-six years before Luigi Zamboni and Gian Battista De Rolandis of
Bologna had distributed rosettes of white, red and green ribbon; Zamboni
was arrested, and strangled himself, afraid of betraying his friends; De
Rolandis was hung on the 23rd of April 1796. Such was the origin of the
flag, but, until 1831, the Carbonaro red, blue and black was the common
standard of the revolution. From that year forth, the destinies of Italy
were accomplished under the colours of better augury, so fit to recall her
fiery volcanoes, her wooded Apennines, her snow-crowned Alps; colours
which in one sense she receives from Dante, who clothes in them the vision
of the glorified Beatrice.</p>

<p>The rising at Parma requires but little comment. The Empress
Marie-Louise neither hated her subjects, nor was hated by them, but her
engagements with Austria prevented her from granting the demanded
concessions, and she abandoned her state, to return to it, indeed, under
Austrian protection, but without the odious corollary of vindictive
measures which was generally meant by a restoration.</p>

<p>Much more important is the history of the Modenese revolution.
Apologists have been found for the Bourbons of Naples, but, if anyone ever
said a good word for Francesco d'Este, it has escaped the notice of the
present writer. Under a despotism without laws (for the edicts of the
Prince daily overrode the Este statute book which was supposed to be in
force), Modena was far more in the power of the priests, or rather of the
Jesuits, than any portion of the states of the Church. Squint-eyed,
crooked in mind and bloodthirsty, Francis was as ideal a bogey-tyrant as
can be discovered outside fiction. In 1822, he hung the priest Giuseppe
Andreoli on the charge of Carbonarism; and his <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg.52]</a></span> theory of justice is
amusingly illustrated by the story of his sending in a bill to Sir Anthony
Panizzi&mdash;who had escaped to England&mdash;for the expenses of hanging
him in effigy.</p>

<p>Francis felt deeply annoyed by the narrow limits of his dominions, and
his annoyance did not decrease with the decreasing chances of his ousting
the Prince of Carignano from the Sardinian throne. He was intensely
ambitious, and one of his subjects, a man, in other respects, of high
intelligence, thought that his ambition could be turned to account for
Italy. It was the mistake over again that Machiavelli had made with Cesare
Borgia.</p>

<p>Ciro Menotti, who conceived the plan of uniting Italy under the Duke of
Modena, was a Modenese landed proprietor who had exerted himself to
promote the industry of straw-plaiting, and the other branches of commerce
likely to be of advantage to an agricultural population. He was known as a
sound philanthropist, an excellent husband and father, a model member of
society. Francis professed to take an interest in industrial matters;
Menotti, therefore, easily gained access to his person. In all the
negotiations that followed, the Modenese patriot was supported and
encouraged by a certain Dr Misley, who was of English extraction, with
whom the Duke seems to have been on familiar terms. It appears not
doubtful that Menotti was led to believe that his political views were
regarded with favour, and that he also received the royal promise that,
whatever happened, his life would be safe. This promise was given because
he had the opportunity of saving the Duke from some great
peril&mdash;probably from assassination, though the particulars were never
divulged.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg.53]</a></span>

<p>Misley went to Paris to concert with the Italian committee which had
its seat there; the movement in Modena was fixed for the first days of
February. But spies got information of the preparations, and on the
evening of the 3rd, before anything had been done, Menotti's house was
surrounded by troops, and after defending it, with the help of his
friends, for two hours, he was wounded and captured. Next day the Duke
despatched the following note to the Governor of Reggio-Emilia: 'A
terrible conspiracy against me has broken out. The conspirators are in my
hands. Send me the hangman.&mdash;Francis.'</p>

<p>Not all, however, of the conspirators were in his hands; the movement
matured, in spite of the seizure of Menotti, and Francis, 'the first
captain in the world,' as he made his troops call him, was so overcome
with fright that on the 5th of February he left Modena with his family,
under a strong military escort, dragging after him Giro Menotti, who, when
Mantua was reached, was consigned to an Austrian fortress.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the revolution triumphed. Modena chose one of her citizens
as dictator, Biagio Nardi, who issued a proclamation in which the words
'Italy is one; the Italian nation is one sole nation,' testified that the
great lesson which Menotti had sought to teach had not fallen on
unfruitful ground. Wild as were the methods by which, for a moment, he
sought to gain his end, his insistance on unity nevertheless gives Menotti
the right to be considered the true precursor of Mazzini in the Italian
Revolution.</p>

<p>Now that the testing-time was come, France threw to the winds the
principle announced in her name with such solemn emphasis. 'Precious
French blood should never be shed except on behalf of French interests,'
said Casimir P&eacute;rier, the new President of the Council. A <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg.54]</a></span> month
after the flight of the Duke of Modena, the inevitable Austrians marched
into his state to win it back for him. The hastily-organised little army
of the new government was commanded by General Zucchi, an old general of
Napoleon, who, when Lombardy passed to Austria, had entered the Austrian
service. He now offered his sword to the Dictator of Modena, who accepted
it, but there was little to be done save to retire with honour before the
6000 Austrians. Zucchi capitulated at Ancona to Cardinal Benvenuti, the
Papal delegate. Those of the volunteers who desired it were furnished with
regular passports, and authorised to take ship for any foreign port. The
most compromised availed themselves of this arrangement, but the vessel
which was to bear Zucchi and 103 others to Marseilles, was captured by the
Austrian Admiral Bandiera, by whom its passengers were kidnapped and
thrown into Venetian prisons, where they were kept till the end of May
1832. This act of piracy was chiefly performed with a view to getting
possession of General Zucchi, who was tried as a deserter, and condemned
to twenty years' imprisonment. Among the prisoners was the young wife of
Captain Silvestro Castiglioni of Modena. 'Go, do your duty as a citizen,'
she had said, when her husband left her to join the insurrection. 'Do not
betray it for me, as perhaps it would make me love you less.' She shared
his imprisonment, but just at the moment of the release, she died from the
hardships endured.</p>

<p>By the end of the month of March, the Austrians had restored Romagna to
the Pope, and Modena to Francis IV. In Romagna the amnesty published by
Cardinal Benvenuti was revoked, but there were no executions; this was not
the case in Modena. The Duke brought back <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg.55]</a></span> Ciro Menotti attached to his
triumphal car, and when he felt that all danger was past, and that the
presence of the Austrians was a guarantee against a popular expression of
anger, he had him hung.</p>

<p>'When my children are grown up, let them know how well I loved my
country,' Menotti wrote to his wife on the morning of his execution. The
letter was intercepted, and only delivered to his family in 1848. The
revolutionists found it in the archives of Modena. On the scaffold he
recalled how he was once the means of saving the Duke's life, and added
that he pardoned his murderer, and prayed that his blood might not fall
upon his head.</p>

<p>During the insurrection in Romagna, an event occurred which was not
without importance to Europe, though it passed almost unnoticed at the
time. The eldest son of Queen Hortense died in her arms at Forl&igrave;,
of a neglected attack of measles; some said of poison, but the report was
unfounded. He and his brother Louis, who had been closely mixed up with
Italian conspiracies for more than a year, went to Romagna to offer their
services as volunteers in the national army. By the death of the elder of
the two, Louis Napoleon became heir to what seemed then the shadowy
sovereignty of the Buonapartes.</p>

<p>No sooner had the Austrians retired from the Legations in July 1831,
than the revolution broke out again. Many things had been promised,
nothing performed; disaffection was universal, anarchy became chronic, and
was increased by the indiscipline of the Papal troops that were sent to
put it down. The Austrians returned and the French occupied Ancona, much
to the Pope's displeasure, and not one whit to the advantage of the
Liberals. This dual foreign occupation of the Papal states lasted till the
winter of 1838.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h4>'YOUNG ITALY' 1831-1844</h4>

<h5>Accession of Charles Albert&mdash;Mazzini's Unitarian
Propaganda&mdash;The Brothers Bandiera.</h5>

<br />


<p>On 27 April 1831, Charles Albert came to the throne he had so nearly
lost. His reconciliation with his uncle, Charles Felix, had been effected
after long and melancholy preliminaries. To wash off the Liberal sins of
his youth, or possibly with a vague hope of finding an escape from his
false position in a soldier's death, he joined the Duc d'Angoul&ecirc;me's
expedition against the Spanish Constitutionalists. His extraordinary
daring in the assault of the Trocadero caused him to be the hero of the
hour when he returned with the army to Paris; but the King of Sardinia
still refused to receive him with favour&mdash;a sufficiently icy favour
when it was granted&mdash;until he signed an engagement, which remained
secret, to preserve intact during his reign the laws and principles of
government which he found in force at his accession. If there had been an
Order of the Millstone, Charles Felix would doubtless have conferred it
upon his dutiful nephew; failing that, he presented to him for signature
this wonderful document, the invention of which he owed to Prince
Metternich. At the Congress of Verona in 1822, Charles Albert's claims to
the succession were recognised, thanks chiefly to the Duke of Wellington,
who represented England in place of Lord Londonderry (Castlereagh), that
statesman <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">
[Pg.57]</a></span> having committed suicide just as he was starting for
Verona. Prince Metternich then proposed that the Prince of Carignano
should be called upon to enter into an agreement identical with the
compact he was brought to sign a couple of years later. In communicating
the proposal to Canning, the Duke of Wellington wrote that he had
demonstrated to Prince Metternich 'the fatality of such an arrangement,'
but that he did not think that he had made the slightest impression on
him. So the event proved; baffled for the moment, the Prince managed to
put his plan in execution through a surer channel.</p>

<p>With the accession of Charles Albert appears upon the political scene a
great actor in the Liberation of Italy, Giuseppe Mazzini. Young and
unknown, except for a vague reputation for restlessness and for talent
which caused the government of Charles Felix to imprison him for six or
seven months at Savona, Mazzini proposed to the new King the terms on
which he might keep his throne, as calmly as Metternich had proposed to
him the terms on which he might ascend it. The contrast is striking; on
the one side the statesman, who still commanded the armed force of
three-fourths of Europe, doing battle for the holy alliance of autocrats,
for the international law of repression, for all the traditions of the old
diplomacy; on the other, the young student with little money and few
friends, already an exile, having no allies but his brain and his pen, who
set himself, certain of success, to dissolve that mighty array of power
and pomp. All his life Charles Albert was a Faust for the possession of
whose soul two irreconcilable forces contended; the struggle was never
more dramatically represented than at this moment in the person of these
two champions.</p>

<p>Mazzini's letter to Charles Albert, which was read by the King, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg.58]</a></span>
widely, though secretly, circulated in Piedmont, began by telling him that
his fellow-countrymen were ready to believe his line of conduct in 1821 to
have been forced on him by circumstances, and that there was not a heart
in Italy that did not quicken at his accession, nor an eye in Europe that
was not turned to watch his first steps in the career that now unfolded
before him. Then he went on to show, with the logical strength in
developing an argument which, joined to a novel and eloquent style, caused
his writings to attract notice from the first, that the King could take no
middle course. He would be one of the first of men, or the last of Italian
tyrants; let him choose. Had he never looked upon Italy, radiant with the
smile of nature, crowned with twenty centuries of sublime memories, the
mother of genius, possessing infinite means, to which only union was
lacking, girt round with such defences that a strong will and a few
courageous breasts would suffice to defend her? Had it never struck him
that she was created for a glorious destiny? Did he not contemplate her
people, splendid still, in spite of the shadow of servitude, the vigour of
whose intellect, the energy of whose passions, even when turned to evil,
showed that the making of a nation was there? Did not the thought come to
him: 'Draw a world out of these dispersed elements like a god from chaos;
unite into one whole the scattered members, and pronounce the words, "It
is mine, and it is happy"?'</p>

<p>Mazzini in 1831 was twenty-six years of age. His father was a Genoese
physician, his mother a native of Chiavari. She was a superior woman, and
devoted more than a mother's care to the excitable and delicate child, who
seemed to her (mothers have sometimes the gift of prophecy) <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg.50]</a></span> to be meant
for an uncommon lot. One of the few personal reminiscences that Mazzini
left recorded, relates to the time and manner in which the idea first came
to him of the possibility of Italians doing something for their country.
He was walking with his mother in the Strada Nuova at Genoa one Sunday in
April 1821, when a tall, black-bearded man with a fiery glance held
towards them a white handkerchief, saying: 'For the refugees of Italy.'
Mazzini's mother, gave him some money, and he passed on. In the streets
were many unfamiliar faces; the fugitives from Turin and Alessandria were
gathered at Genoa before they departed by sea into exile. The impression
which that scene made on the mind of the boy of sixteen was never
effaced.</p>

<p>Owing to his delicate health, Mazzini's early education was carried on
at home, where the social atmosphere was that of one of those little
centres in a provincial capital which are composed of a few people, mostly
kindred, of similar tastes, who lead useful and refined lives, content
with moderate ease. The real exclusiveness of such centres exceeds any
that exists in the most aristocratic sphere in the world. The Mazzinis
were, moreover, Genoese to the core; and this was another reason for
exclusiveness, and for holding aloof from the governing class. Mazzini was
born a few days after Napoleon entered Genoa as its lord. He had not,
therefore, breathed the air of the ancient Republic; but there was the
unadulterated republicanism of a thousand years in his veins.</p>

<p>When he grew to manhood his appearance was striking. The black, flowing
hair, the pale, olive complexion, the finely-cut features and lofty brow,
the deep-set eyes, which could smile as only Italian eyes can smile, but
which could also flash astral infinitudes of scorn, the <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg.60]</a></span> fragile
figure, even the long, delicate, tapering fingers, marked him for a man
apart&mdash;though whether a poet or an apostle, a seer or a saint, it was
not easy to decide. Yet this could be said at once: if this man
concentrated all his being on a single point, he would wield the power,
call it what we will, which in every age has worked miracles and moved
mountains.</p>

<p>Mazzini became a Carbonaro, though the want of clear, guiding
principles in Carbonarism made him misdoubt its efficacy, and its
hierarchical mysteries and initiatory ordeals repelled him by their
childishness. Then followed his arrest, and his detention in the fortress
of Savona, which was the turning-point in his mental life. Before that
date he learnt, after it he taught. From his high-perched cell he saw the
sea and the sky&mdash;with the Alps, the sublimest things in Nature. The
voices of the fishermen reached his ears, though he could not see them. A
tame goldfinch was his companion. Here, in a solitude and peace which he
remembered with regret in the stormy and sorrowful years that were to
come, he conceived his message and the mission, in which he believed to
the last day of his life.</p>

<p>He resolved to found a new association on broader and simpler lines
than the secret societies of the past, which should aim not only at the
material freeing of Italy from her present bondage, but at her moral and
religious regeneration. To aim at material progress of any kind, without
at the same time aiming at a higher moral progress, seemed to Mazzini
absurd; to attempt to pull down without attempting to build up seemed to
him criminal. Thus he accused the Socialists of substituting the progress
of humanity's kitchen for the progress of humanity. He believed that
Italy, united and redeemed, was destined to <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg.61]</a></span> shed through the world the light
of a new moral unity, which should end the reign of Scepticism, triumphant
among discordant creeds. Mazzini's religious belief was the motor of his
whole being. The Catholicism in which he was outwardly brought up never
seems to have touched his inner nature; he went through no spiritual
wrench in leaving a faith that was never a reality to him. The same is
true of innumerable young Italians, who, when they begin to read and
study, drift out of their childhood's religion without a struggle or a
regret. But thought and study brought Mazzini what it rarely brings to
these young men&mdash;the necessity to find something in which he could
believe. He had not long to seek for a basis to his creed, because he was
one of the men from the prophets of old to Spinoza, from Spinoza to
Gordon, to whom the existence of God is a matter of experience rather than
an object of faith. Starting from this point, he formed his religion out
of what he regarded as its inevitable deductions. If God existed, his
creatures must be intended for perfection; if this were the Divine scheme,
man's one business was to carry it out. He considered the idea of duty
separated from the idea of God to be illogical. Either the development of
human things depended on a providential law, or it was left to chance and
passing circumstance, and to the dexterity of the man who turned these to
most account. God was the sole source of duty; duty the sole law of life.
Mazzini did not denounce Catholicism or any other religion as false. He
saw in it a stepping-stone to purer comprehension, which would be reached
when man's intellect was sufficiently developed for him to be able to do
without symbols.</p>

 <span class="caption">GIUSEPPE MAZZINI</span></div>

<br />


<p>The conscience of humanity is the last tribunal. Ideas, as well as
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg.62]</a></span>
institutions, change and expand, but certain fundamental principles are
fixed. The family would always exist; property would always exist. The
first, 'the heart's fatherland,' was the source of the only true
happiness, the only joys untainted by grief, which were given to man.
Those who wished to abolish the second were like the savage who cut down
the tree in order to gather the fruit. In the future, free association
would be the great agent of moral and material progress. The authority
which once rested in popes and emperors now devolved on the people.
Instead of 'God and the King,' Mazzini proposed the new formula 'God and
the People.' By the people he understood no caste or class, whether high
or low, but the universality of men composing the nation. The nation is
the sole sovereign; its will, expressed by delegates, must be law to all
its citizens.</p>

<p>By degrees certain words acquired more and more a mystical significance
in Mazzini's mind; the very name of Rome, for instance, had for him a sort
of talismanic fascination, not unlike that possessed by Jerusalem for the
medi&aelig;val Christian. When he spoke of the people or the republic he
frequently used those terms in an ideal and visionary sense (as
theologians use the Church) rather than in one strictly corresponding with
the case of any existing nation, or any hitherto tried form of government.
This does not alter the fact that his theories, which have been briefly
summarised, are not hard to comprehend, as has been said by those who did
not know in what they consisted, nor, taken one by one, are they novel.
What was new in the nineteenth century was the appearance of a
revolutionary leader, who was before all things a religious and ethical
teacher. And though Mazzini never founded the Church of Precursors, of
which he dreamt, his influence was as surely due to his belief in his
religious <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">
[Pg.63]</a></span> mission, as was the influence of Savonarola. The
Italians are not a mystical people, but they have always followed mystical
leaders. The less men are prone to ideal enthusiasm the more attracted are
they by it; Don Quixote, as Heine remarked, always draws Sancho Panza
after him.</p>

<p>Mazzini had a natural capacity for organisation, and the Association of
Young Italy which he founded at Marseilles, the first nucleus being a
group of young, penniless refugees, soon obtained an astonishing
development. Up to the time of his 'Letter to Charles Albert,' his exile
had been so far voluntary that he might have remained in Piedmont had he
agreed to live in one of the smaller towns under the watchful care of the
police, but he declined the terms, and the first effect of the 'Letter'
was a stringent order to arrest him if he recrossed the frontier. He was
not surprised at that result. Mazzini's attitude towards the Sardinian
monarchy was perfectly well defined. Republican himself, even to
fanaticism, he placed the question of unity, which for him meant national
existence, above the question of the republic. He did not believe that the
House of Savoy would unite Italy, but if unity could only be had under
what he looked upon as the inauspicious form of monarchy, he would not
reject it. He was like the real mother in the judgment of Solomon, who,
because she loved her child, was ready to give it up sooner than see it
cut in two.</p>

<p>Apart from personal hereditary instincts and predilections, Mazzini
thought that he saw in the glorious memories of the Italian republics a
clear indication that the commonwealth was the form of government which
ought and would be adopted by the Italy of the future. But, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg.64]</a></span> unlike most
politicians, he laid down the principle that, after all, when free, the
nation must decide for itself. 'To what purpose,' he asks, 'do we
constantly speak of the sovereignty of the people, and of our reverence
for the national will, if we are to disregard it as soon as it pronounces
in contradiction to our wishes?'</p>

<p>He did not succeed in making the majority of his countrymen
republicans, but he contributed more than any other man towards inspiring
the whole country with the desire for unity. Herein lies his great work.
Without Mazzini, when would the Italians have got beyond the fallacies of
federal republics, leagues of princes, provincial autonomy, insular
home-rule, and all the other dreams of independence reft of its only
safeguard which possessed the minds of patriots of every party in Italy
and of nearly every well-wisher to Italian freedom abroad?</p>

<p>In 1831, most educated Italians did not even wish for unity, and this
is still truer of the republicans than of the monarchists. Some, like
Manzoni, did wish for it, but, like him, said nothing about it, for fear
of being thought madmen. A flash of the true light illuminated the mind of
Giro Menotti, but that was extinguished on the scaffold. Then it was that
Mazzini came forward with the news that Italy could <i>only</i> be made
free and independent by being united; unity was the ruling tendency of the
century, and, as far as Italy went, no Utopia, but a certain conclusion.
This was repeated over and over again, wherever there were Italians, over
the inhabited globe. By means of sailors, 'Young Italy' spread like
lightning. Giuseppe Garibaldi was made a member by a sailor on the shores
of the Black Sea.</p>

<p>With the masses, unity proved the wonder-working word which
Confalonieri had said was the one thing needful&mdash;a word yet fitter to
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg.65]</a></span>
work wonders than 'War to the Stranger.' Among the cultivated classes, it
was much slower in gaining ground, and particularly among statesmen and
diplomatists. But in the end it was to convert them all.</p>

<p>'"Young Italy,"' writes Mazzini, 'closed the period of political sects,
and initiated that of educational associations.' 'Great revolutions,' he
says again, 'are the work of principles rather than of bayonets.' It was
by the diffusion of ideas that 'Young Italy' became a commanding factor in
the events of the next thirty years. The insurrectional attempts planned
under its guidance did not succeed, nor was it likely that they should
succeed. Devised by exiles, at a distance, they lacked the first elements
of success. The earliest of these attempts aimed at an invasion of Savoy;
it was hoped that the Sardinian army and people would join the little band
of exiles in a movement for the liberation of Lombardy. The revolution of
1821 had evidently suggested this plan to Mazzini, but it was foredoomed
to misfortune. The Piedmontese authorities got wind of it, and a hunt
followed for the members of 'Young Italy'; most severe measures were
taken; there were eleven executions, and numberless sentences to long
terms of imprisonment. Jacobo Ruffini, the younger brother of the author
of <i>Dr Antonio</i>, and Mazzini's most beloved friend, committed suicide
in prison, fearing to reveal the names of his associates. The apologists
for Charles Albert say that if he had not shown the will and ability to
deal severely with the conspirators, Austria would have insisted on a
military occupation. Whatever were his motives, this is the saddest page
of his unhappy reign.</p>

<p>Checked in 1833, the descent on Savoy was actually attempted in 1834,
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg.66]</a></span>
with Mazzini's consent, though not by his wish. An officer who had won
some celebrity in the Polish revolution, General Ramorino, a Savoyard by
origin, was given the command. Ramorino was a gambler, who could not be
trusted with money, but Mazzini's suspicion that on this occasion he
played the part of traitor is not proved. However that may be, the
expedition ended almost as soon as it began. Ramorino crossed the frontier
of Savoy at the head of the column, but when he heard that a Polish
reinforcement had been stopped on the Lake of Geneva, he retreated into
Switzerland, and advised the band to follow him.</p>

<p>After these events, Mazzini could no longer carry on his propaganda in
France. He took refuge in England, where a great part of his life was to
be passed, and of which he spoke, to the last, as his second country. The
first period of his residence in England was darkened by the deep distress
and discouragement into which the recent events had plunged him; but his
faith in the future prevailed, and he went on with his work. His
endeavours to help his fellow-exiles reduced him to the last stage of
poverty; the day came when he was obliged to pawn a coat and an old pair
of boots. These money difficulties did not afflict him, and by degrees his
writings in English periodicals brought some addition to the small
quarterly allowance which he received from his mother. It seems strange,
though it is easily explained, that it was in London that he first got to
know the Italian working classes. He was surprised and gladdened by the
abundance of good elements which he found in them. No country, indeed, has
more reason to hope in her working men than the land whose sons have
tunnelled the Alps, cut the most arduous railway lines in America and
India, brought up English ships from the deep, laid the caissons (a <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg.67]</a></span> task of
extreme danger) which support the great structure of the Bridge of the
Firth of Forth, and left their bones to whiten at Panama. 'It is the
universal testimony,' writes a high American authority, 'that no more
faithful men have come among us.' What was the cause of the slaughter of
the Aigues Mortes? That the Italians worked too well.</p>

<p>Mazzini wrote for his humble friends the treatise on <i>The Duties of
Man</i>, in which he told them that he loved them too well to flatter
them. Another work that occupied him and consoled him was the rescue and
moral improvement of the children employed by organ-grinders, and he was
the first to call attention to the white slavery to which many of them
were subjected. He opened a school in Hatton Garden, in which he taught,
and which he mainly supported for the seven years from 1841 to 1848.</p>

<p>The enterprise of the Brothers Bandiera belongs to the history of
'Young Italy,' though Mazzini himself had tried to prevent it, believing
that it could only end in the sacrifice of all concerned. Nor, at the
last, did the actors in it expect anything else. They had hoped for better
things; for a general movement in the South of Italy, or at least for an
undertaking on a larger and less irrational basis. But promises failed,
money was not forthcoming, and it was a choice between doing nothing or a
piece of heroic folly. Contrary to Mazzini's entreaties, they chose the
second alternative.</p>

<p>Attilio and Emilio Bandiera were sons of the Austrian admiral who, in
1831, arrested Italian fugitives at sea. Placed by their father in the
Austrian navy, they renounced every prospect of a brilliant career to
enter the service of their down-trodden country. When they deserted, <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg.68]</a></span> strong
efforts were made by the Archduke Rainieri, through their mother, to win
them back, but neither the offers of pardon nor the poor woman's tears and
reproaches turned them from their purpose. Another deserter was with them,
Lieutenant Domenico Moro, a youth of great charm of person and
disposition, who had been employed with a mixed force of Englishmen and
Austrians in the Lebanon, where he formed a warm friendship with
Lieutenant, now Admiral, Sir George Wellesley, who still preserves an
affectionate remembrance of him. Nicola Ricciotti, a Roman subject who had
devoted all his life to Italy, and Anacarsi Nardi, son of the dictator of
Modena, were also of the band, which counted about twenty.</p>

<p>The Bandieras and their companions sailed from Corfu for the coast of
Calabria on the 11th of June 1844. 'If we fall,' they wrote to Mazzini,
'tell our countrymen to imitate our example, for life was given to us to
be nobly and usefully employed, and the cause for which we shall have
fought and died is the purest and holiest that ever warmed the heart of
man.' It was their last letter. After they landed in Calabria one of their
number disappeared; there is every reason to suppose that he went to
betray them. They wandered for a few days in the mountains, looking for
the insurgent band which they had been falsely told was waiting for them,
and then fell into an ambush prepared by the Neapolitan troops. Some died
fighting; nine were shot at Cosenza, including the Bandieras, Mori,
Ricciotti and Nardi. Boccheciampi the Corsican, whom they suspected of
treason, was brought up to be confronted with them during the trial; when
asked if he knew who he was, Nardi replied: 'I know no word in my divine
Italian language that can fitly describe that man.' Boccheciampi was
condemned to a nominal imprisonment; when he came out of prison he wrote
to a <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">
[Pg.69]</a></span> Greek girl of Corfu, to whom he was engaged, to join
him at Naples, that they might be married. The girl had been deeply in
love with him, and had already given him part of her dowry, but she
answered: 'A traitor cannot wed a Greek maiden; I bear with me the
blessing of my parents; upon you rests the curse of God.'</p>

<p>The martyrdom of the Bandieras made a great impression, especially in
England, where the circumstance came to light that their correspondence
with Mazzini had been tampered with in the English Post Office, and that
information as to their plans had reached the Austrian and Neapolitan
Governments through the British Foreign Office. The affair was brought
before the House of Commons by Thomas Duncombe. The Home Secretary
repeated a calumny which had appeared many years before in a French
newspaper, to the effect that the murder of an Italian in Rodez by two of
his fellow-countrymen was the result of an order from the Association of
Young Italy. Sir James Graham had to apologise afterwards for 'the injury
inflicted on Mr Mazzini' by this statement, which he was obliged to admit
was supported by no evidence, and was contrary to the opinion of the Judge
who tried the case.</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> having observed in a leading article that the gravity
of the fact in question, the violation of private correspondence in the
Post Office, was not affected by the merits or demerits of Mr Mazzini, of
whom it professed to 'know nothing,' Thomas Carlyle wrote next day a
letter containing words which may be quoted as some of the best and truest
ever written about the great Italian: 'I have had the honour to know Mr
Mazzini for a series of years, and, whatever I may think of his practical
insight and skill in worldly affairs, I can with great <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg.70]</a></span> freedom
testify that he, if I have ever seen one such, is a man of genius and
virtue, one of those rare men, numerable unfortunately but as units in
this world, who are worthy to be called martyr souls; who in silence,
piously in their daily life, understand and practise what is meant by
that.' <a name="FNanchor2"></a><a href=

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h4>THE POPE LIBERATOR</h4>

<h5>1844-1847</h5>

<h5>Events leading to the Election of Pius IX.&mdash;The Petty
Princes&mdash;Charles Albert, Leopold and Ferdinand.</h5>

<p><br />
 The day is drawing near when the century which witnessed the liberation
of Italy will have passed away. Already a generation has grown up which
can but faintly realise the passionate hopes and fears with which the
steps that led through defeat to the ultimate victory were watched, not
only by Italians, but by thousands who had never set foot in Italy. Never
did a series of political events evoke a sympathy so wide and so
disinterested, and it may be foretold with confidence that it never will
again. Italy rising from the grave was the living romance of myriads of
young hearts that were lifted from the common level of trivial interests
and selfish ends, from the routine of work or pleasure, both deadening
without some diviner spark, by a sustained enthusiasm that can hardly be
imagined now. There were, indeed, some who asked what was all this to
them? What were the 'extraneous Austrian Emperor,' or the 'old chimera of
a Pope' (Carlyle's designations) to the British taxpayer? Some there were
in England who were deeply attached still to the 'Great Hinge on which
Europe depended,' and even to the most clement Spanish Bourbons of Naples,
about whom strangely beautiful things are to be read in old numbers of
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg.72]</a></span>
the <i>Quarterly Review</i>. But on the whole, English men and
women&mdash;in mind half Italian, whether they will it or not, from the
day they begin to read their own literature from Chaucer to Shakespeare,
from Shakespeare to Shelley, from Shelley to Rossetti and
Swinburne&mdash;were united at that time in warmth of feeling towards
struggling Italy as they have been united in no political sentiment
relating to another nation, and in few concerning their own country.</p>

<p>It would be vain to expect that the record of Italian vicissitudes
during the years when the fate of Italy hung in the balance can awake or
renew the spellbound interest caused by the events themselves. The reader
of recent history is like the novel reader who begins at the last
chapter&mdash;he is too familiar with how it all ended to be keenly
affected by the development of the plot. Yet it is plain that we are in a
better position to appreciate the process of development than was the case
when the issue remained uncertain. We can estimate more accurately the
difficulties which stood in the way, and judge more impartially the means
that were taken to remove them. One outcome of this fuller knowledge is
the conviction that patriotism was the monopoly of no single Italian
party. The leaders, and still more their henchmen, were in the habit of
saying very hard things about each other. It was natural and unavoidable;
but there is no excuse now for failing to recognise that there were pure
and devoted patriots on the one side as well as on the other&mdash;men
whose only desire was the salvation of Italy, to effect which no sacrifice
seemed too great. Nor were their labours unfruitful, for there was work
for all of them to do; and the very diversity of opinion, though
unfortunate under some aspects, was not so under all. If no one had raised
the question of unity before all things, Italy might be still a
geographical expression. If no one had tried to wring concessions from the

would never have been proved; and though they might have been overturned,
they would have left behind a lasting possibility of ignorant
reaction.</p>

<p>The Great Powers had presented to the Court of Rome in 1831 a
memorandum, in which various moderate reforms and improvements were
proposed as urgently necessary to put an end to the intolerable abuses
which were rife in the states of the Church, and, most of all, in Romagna.
The abolition of the tribunal of the Holy Office, the institution of a
Council of State, lay education, and the secularisation of the
administration were among the measures recommended. In 1845 a certain
Pietro Renzi collected a body of spirited young men at San Marino, and
made a dash on Rimini, where he disarmed the small garrison. The other
towns were not prepared, and Renzi and his companions were obliged to
retire into Tuscany; but the revolution, partial as it had been, raised
discussion in consequence of the manifesto issued by its promoters, in
which a demand was made for the identical reforms vainly advocated by
European diplomacy fourteen years before. If these were granted, the
insurgents engaged to lay down their arms. The manifesto was written by
Luigi Carlo Farini, who was destined to play a large part in future
affairs. It proved to Europe that even the most conservative elements in
the nation were driven to revolution by the sheer hopelessness of the
dead-lock which the Italian rulers sought by every means to prolong.
Massimo d'Azeglio, who was then known only as a painter of talent and a
writer of historical novels, first made his mark as a politician by the
pamphlet entitled <i>Gli ultimi casi di Romagna</i>, in which his
arguments derived force from the fact that, when travelling in the
district, he had done all in his power to induce the Liberals to keep
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg.74]</a></span>
within the bounds of legality. But he confessed that, when someone says:
'I suffer too much,' it is an unsatisfactory answer to retort: 'You have
not suffered enough.' Massimo d'Azeglio had lived for many years an
artist's life in Rome and the country round, where his aristocratic birth
and handsome face made him popular with all classes. The transparent
integrity of his nature overcame the diffidence usually inspired by
strangers among a somewhat suspicious people, and he got to know more
thoroughly than any other North Italian the real aspirations of the Pope's
subjects. He listened to their complaints and their plans, and if they
asked his advice, he invariably replied: 'Let us speak clearly. What is it
that you wish and I with you? You wish to have done with priestly rule,
and to send the Teutons out of Italy? If you invite them to decamp, they
will probably say, "No, thank you!" Therefore you must use force; and
where is it to be had? If you have not got it, you must find somebody who
has. In Italy who has it, or, to speak more precisely, who has a little of
it? Piedmont, because it, at least, enjoys an independent life, and
possesses an army and a surplus in the treasury.' His friends answered:
'What of Charles Albert, of 1821, of 1832?' Now, there was no one who felt
less trust in Charles Albert than Massimo d'Azeglio; he admitted it with
something like remorse in later years. But he believed in his ambition,
and he thought it madness to throw away what he regarded as the sole
chance of freeing Italy on account of private doubts of the King of
Sardinia's sincerity.</p>

<p>Charles Albert had reigned for fourteen years, and still the mystery
which surrounded his character formed as impenetrable a veil as ever. The
popular nickname of <i>Re Tentenna</i> (King Waverer) seemed, in a <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg.75]</a></span> sense,
accepted by him when he said to the Duke d'Aumale in 1843: 'I am between
the dagger of the Carbonari and the chocolate of the Jesuits.' He chose,
as bride for his eldest son, an Austrian princess, who, however, had known
no country but Italy. His internal policy was not simply stationary, it
was retrograde. If his consent was obtained to some progressive measure,
he withdrew it at the last moment, or insisted on the introduction of
modifications which nullified the whole. His want of stability drove one
of his ministers to jump out of a window. In spite of the candid reference
to the Jesuit's cup of chocolate, he allowed the Society of Jesus to
dictate its will in Piedmont. Victor Amadeus, the first King of Sardinia,
took public education out of the hands of the Jesuits, after receiving the
following deathbed communication from one of the Order who was his own
confessor: 'Deeply sensible of your many favours, I can only show my
gratitude by a final piece of advice, but of such importance that perhaps
it may suffice to discharge my debt. Never have a Jesuit for confessor. Do
not ask me the grounds of this advice, I should not be at liberty to tell
them to you.' The lesson was forgotten now. Charles Albert was not content
to wear a hair-shirt himself; he would have liked to see all his subjects
furnished with the same garment. The result was, that Piedmont was not a
comfortable place for Liberals to live in, nor a lively place for anyone.
Yet there is hardly anything more certain than that all this time the King
was constantly dreaming of turning the Austrians out of Italy. His
government kept its attention fixed on two points: the improvement of the
army, and the accumulation of a reserve fund to be available in case of
war. Drill and thrift, which made the German Empire out of Prussia, if
they did <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">
[Pg.76]</a></span> not lead straight to equally splendid results south of
the Alps, were still what rendered it possible for Piedmont to defy
Austria when the time came. In 1840, Charles Albert wrote to his Minister
of War: 'It is a fine thing to win twenty battles; as for me, I should be
content to win ten on behalf of a cause I know of, and to fall in the
tenth&mdash;then, indeed, I would die blessing the Lord.' A year or two
later, he unearthed and reassumed the ancient motto of the House of Savoy:
'J'attends mon astre.' Nevertheless, to the outward world his intentions
remained enigmatical, and it was therefore with extreme surprise that
Massimo d'Azeglio (who, on his return from the Roman states, asked
permission to inform the King of the impressions made on him by his
travels) received the injunction to tell his Liberal friends 'that when
the occasion presented itself, his life, the life of his sons, his
treasure, and his army would all be spent for the Italian cause.'</p>

<p>The fifteen years' pontificate of Gregory XVI. ended on the 1st June of
1846. In spite of the care taken by those around him to keep the aged
pontiff in a fool's paradise with regard to the real state of his
dominions, a copy of <i>The Late Events in Romagna</i> fell into his
hands, and considerably disturbed his peace of mind. He sent two prelates
to look into the condition of the congested provinces, and their tour,
though it resulted in nothing else, called forth new protests and
supplications from the inhabitants, of which the most noteworthy was an
address written by Count Aurelio Saffi, who was destined to pass many
honourable years of exile in England. This address attacked the root of
the evil in a passage which exposed the unbearable vexations of a
government based on espionage. The acknowledged power of an irresponsible
police was backed by the secret force of an army of private spies and
informers. The sentiment of legality was being <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg.77]</a></span> stamped out of the public
conscience, and with it religion and morality. 'Bishops have been heard to
preach civil war&mdash;a crusade against the Liberals; priests seem to mix
themselves in wretched party strife, egging on the mob to vent its worst
passions. There is not a Catholic country in which the really Christian
priest is so rarely found as in the States of the Church.'</p>

<p>If Gregory XVI. was not without reasons for disquietude in his last
hours, he could take comfort in the fact that he had succeeded in keeping
railways out of all parts of his dominions. Gas and suspension bridges
were also classed as works of the Evil One, and vigorously tabooed. Among
the Pope's subjects there was a young prelate who had never been able to
make out what there was subversive to theology in a steam-engine, or why
the safety of the Papal government should depend on its opposing every
form of material improvement, although in discussing these subjects he
generally ended by saying: 'After all I am no politician, and I may be
mistaken.' This prelate was Cardinal Mastai-Ferretti, Bishop of Imola.
Born in 1792 at Sinigaglia, of a good though rather needy family, Count
Giovanni Maria Mastai was piously brought up by his mother, who dedicated
him at an early age to the Virgin, to whom she believed that she owed his
recovery from an illness which had been pronounced fatal. Roman Catholic
writers connect the promulgation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception
with this incident of childhood. After entering the priesthood, young
Mastai devoted most of his energies to active charity, and remained, as he
said, 'no politician,' being singularly ignorant of the world and of
public affairs, though full of amiable wishes that everyone should be
happy. Some years spent in missionary work in South America <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg.78]</a></span> failed to
enlarge his practical knowledge, the limits of which he was the first to
recognise&mdash;a fact that tended to make him all his life the
instrument, not of his own will, but of the wills of men whom he honestly
thought cleverer and more experienced than himself. His chief friends in
his Romagnol diocese, friends on the intimate basis of social equality and
common provincial interests, were sound patriots, though not
revolutionists, and the future Pio Nono involuntarily adopted their ideas
and sympathies. He saw with his eyes certain abuses so glaring that they
admitted of no two opinions, and these helped to convince him of the truth
of his friends' arguments in favour of a completely new order of things.
One such abuse was the encouragement given by government to the Society of
the Centurioni, the latest evolution of the Calderai; the Centurions,
recruited among roughs and peasants, were set upon the respectable middle
classes, over which they tyrannised by secret accusations or open
violence: it was well understood that anyone called a Liberal, or
Freemason, or Carbonaro could be beaten or killed without inquiries being
made.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Imola was frequently in the house of the Count and
Countess Pasolini, who kept their friend well supplied with the new books
on Italian affairs; thus he read not only D'Azeglio's <i>Cast di
Romagna</i>, but also Cesare Balbo's <i>Le Speranze d'Italia,</i> which
propounded a plan for an Italian federation, and Gioberti's <i>Primato
morale e civile degli Italiani</i>, in which this plan was elaborately
developed. Gioberti indicated the Supreme Pontiff as the natural head of
the Italian Union, and the King of Sardinia as Italy's natural deliverer
from foreign domination. The eternal fitness of things, and the history of
many centuries, proved the Pope to be the proper paramount civil authority
in Italy, 'which is the capital of Europe, <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg.79]</a></span> because Rome is the religious
metropolis of the world.' An ex-member of 'Young Italy,' a Piedmontese by
birth, a priest by ordination, Gioberti's profession of faith was derived
from these three sources, and it attracted thousands of Italians by its
apparent reconciliation of the interests of the papacy, and of the
Sardinian monarchy, with the most advanced views of the newest school.
History, to which Gioberti appealed, might have told him that a reversal
of the law of gravity was as likely to happen as the performance by the
papacy of the mission he proposed to it; but men believe what they wish to
believe, and his work found, as has been said, thousands of admirers,
among whom none was more sincere than Cardinal Mastai. The day on which
Count Pasolini gave him a copy of <i>Il Primato</i> he created that great,
and under some aspects pathetic illusion, the reforming Pope.</p>

<p>The Conclave opened on the 14th of June 1846. During the Bishop of
Imola's journey to Rome a white pigeon had perched several times on his
carriage. The story became known; people said the same thing had occurred
to a coming Pope on former occasions, and the augury was accepted with joy
and satisfaction. He was, in fact, elected after the Conclave had lasted
only two days, while the Conclave which elected his predecessor lasted
sixty-four. The brevity of that to which Pius IX. owed the tiara was
looked upon by the populace as something miraculous, but it was the result
of the well-considered determination of the Italian Cardinals not to allow
time for Austrian intrigues to obtain the election of a Pope who would be
ruled from Vienna. When the new Pope appeared on the balcony of the
Quirinal to give his first benediction, the people, carried away by his
youthful yet majestic bearing, and by the hopes which already centred in
him, broke into <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">
[Pg.80]</a></span> frantic cries of: 'We have a Pope! He loves us! He is
our Father!' If they had cried: 'We have a new heaven and a new earth,'
they would but have expressed the delirium which, starting from Rome,
spread throughout Italy.</p>

<p>On the night of the 6th of December 1846, the whole line of the
Apennines from Liguria to Calabria was illuminated. A hundred years
before, a stone thrown by the child Balilla had given the signal for the
expulsion of the Austrians from Genoa: this was the memory flashed from
height to height by countless beacons, but while celebrating the past,
they were the fiery heralds of a greater revolution.</p>

<p>The upheaval of Europe did not become a fact, however, for another
year. Meantime, the Roman States attracted more attention than any other
part of the peninsula, from the curiosity awakened by the progress of the
experiment of which they were the scene. It is not doubtful that at the
first moment Pius IX. was under the impression that the problem he had
taken in hand was eminently simple. A little goodwill on the part of
everybody, an amnesty to heal old sores, and a few administrative reforms,
ought, he thought, to set everything right. Such was not the opinion of
intelligent onlookers who were students of politics&mdash;especially if
they were foreigners, and could therefore keep their heads moderately cool
in the prevailing excitement. The wave of a wand may seem to effect
marvels, but long and silent causes prepare the way for each event. Now
what had been going on for years in the Roman States was not the process
of gradual growth, but the process of rapid disintegration. The Temporal
Power of the Popes had died without anyone noticing it, and there was
nothing <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">
[Pg.81]</a></span> left but a body in the course of dissolution. Every
foreigner in Rome during the reign of Gregory XVI. bore witness that his
government depended for its existence absolutely on the Swiss Guards. In
1845, Count Rossi told Guizot that without the Swiss regiments the
government in the Legations and the Marches 'would be overthrown in the
twinkling of an eye.' The British agent in Rome, writing during the
Conclave, bore this out by the statement, which applied not to one portion
of the Roman states, but to all, that 'the government could not stand
without the protection of Austria and the immediate presence of the
Swiss.' On the accession of Pius IX., the props, such as they were, which
had prevented an earlier collapse of the Temporal Power, were either
removed or rendered useless. The Swiss might as well have been disbanded
at once as retained merely to be a bone of contention between the new
government and the people, since it was understood that a vigorous use of
their services would never be resorted to; while Austrian protection was
transferred from the Pope to the disaffected party in the Church, which
consisted in a large proportion of the cardinals and of the inferior
clergy who were afraid that, with the reform of abuses, they would lose
their influence over the lower class of their flocks. The English
diplomatic agents in Italy also firmly believed that Austria coupled with
her support of the ultramontane malcontents the direct encouragement of
the disorderly elements of the population. To resist all these contrary
forces, Pius IX. had only a popularity which, though for the time immense,
was founded almost completely on imagination. 'It was,' said Mr Petre,
'the name and known views of Pius, rather than his acts, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg.82]</a></span> which aroused
so much interest.' If for 'known views' be substituted 'supposed views,'
the remark exactly describes the situation.</p>

<p>Popularity is very well, but a government cannot long subsist on the
single fact of the popularity of the sovereign. When the Roman mob began
to cry: 'Viva Pio Nono <i>solo</i>,' the fate of the experiment was
sealed. Real control slipped from the hands that nominally wielded it.
'The influence,' Mr Petre wrote to Sir George Hamilton, 'of one individual
of the lower class, Angelo Brunetti, hardly known but by his nickname of
Ciceruacchio, has for the last month kept the peace of the city more than
any power possessed by the authorities, from the command which he exerts
over the populace.' It was Ciceruacchio who preserved order when in July
1847 the air was full of rumours of a vast reactionary plot, which aimed
at carrying off the Pope, and putting things back as they were under
Gregory. That such a plot was ever conceived, or, at anyrate, that it
received the sanction of the high personages whose names were mentioned in
connection with it, is generally doubted now; but it was believed in by
many of the representatives of foreign Powers then in Italy. The public
mind in Rome was violently disturbed. Austria made the excitement the
excuse for occupying the town of Ferrara, where, by the accepted
interpretation of the Treaty of Vienna, she had only the right to garrison
the fortress. This aggression called forth a strong remonstrance from the
Pope's Secretary of State, Cardinal Ferretti; and though a compromise was
arrived at through the mediation of Lord Palmerston, the feeling against
Austria grew more and more exasperated in the Roman states, and the Pope
consented, not, it seemed, much against the grain, to preparations being
taken in hand with a view to the possible eventuality of war.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg.83]</a></span>
At this date the Italian question was better apprehended at Vienna than in
any other part of Europe. A man of Prince Metternich's talents does not
devote a long life to statecraft without learning to distinguish the real
drift of political currents. While Lord Palmerston still felt sure that
reforms, and nothing but reforms, were what Italy wanted, Prince
Metternich saw that two real forces were at work from the Alps to the
Straits of Messina, and two only: desire for union, hatred of Austria. Nor
was it his fault if the English Cabinet or the rest of the world remained
unenlightened. Besides enlarging on this truth in frequent diplomatic
communications, he caused it to be continually dwelt upon in the Vienna
<i>Observer</i>, the organ of the Austrian Government, which printed
illustrative quotations from the writings of Mazzini, of whom it said that
'he has the one merit of despising hypocrisy, and proceeding firmly and
directly to his true end. Persons who are versed in history will know that
this is exactly the same end as that at which Arnold of Brescia and Cola
di Rienzi formerly aimed. The only difference is, that the revolutionary
dream has in the course of centuries gained in self-reliance and
confidence.' It may truly be affirmed after this that Metternich 'had the
one merit of despising hypocrisy.' Exactly the same end as Arnold of
Brescia and Cola di Rienzi&mdash;who better could have described the
scheme of Italian redemption?</p>

<p>In the course of the summer of 1847, the Prince said more than once to
the British Ambassador: 'The Emperor is determined not to lose his Italian
dominions.' It was no idle boast, the speaker felt confident, that the
troops in Lombardy and Venetia could keep those provinces from taking an
active part in the 'revolution' which he declared to be <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg.84]</a></span> already
complete over all central Italy, though the word revolution had never yet
been mentioned. Nor was it only in the Austrian army that he trusted;
Metternich was persuaded that neither in Lombardy nor in Venetia was there
any fear of a really popular and, therefore, formidable movement. He
believed that Austria's only enemy was the aristocracy. He even threw out
hints that if the Austrian Government condescended to do so, it could
raise a social or peasants' war of the country people against their
masters. This is the policy which has been elaborately followed by the
Russians in Poland. The Austrians pointed to their virtue in not resorting
to it; but some tentative experiments in such a direction had not given
results of a kind to encourage them to go on. The Italian peasant, though
ignorant, had a far quicker innate intelligence than his unfortunate
Polish brother. He did not dislike his masters, who treated him at least
with easy familiarity, and he detested foreigners&mdash;those foreigners,
no matter of what nation, who for two thousand years had brought the
everlasting curse of war upon his fields. The conscription, which carried
off his sons for eight years into distant lands, of which he could not
pronounce the name, was alone enough to alienate him from the Austrian
Government. In hoping to find a friend in the Italian peasant, Metternich
reckoned without his host. On the other hand, he was strictly correct in
his estimate of the patriotism of the aristocracy. The fact always seemed
to the Prince a violation of eternal laws. According to him, the
fore-ordained disaffected in every country were drawn from the middle
classes. What business had noblemen with ancient names and fine estates to
prefer Spielberg to their beautiful palaces and fairy-like villas on the
Lombard lakes? Was it on purpose to spite the best of governments, and the
one most favourable to the <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_85" id=
"Page_85">[Pg.85]</a></span> aristocratic principle, which had always held
out paternal hands to them? Could anything be imagined more
aggravating?</p>

<p>This feature in Italian liberation has been kept mostly in the
background. Democratic chroniclers were satisfied to ignore it, and to the
men themselves their enormous sacrifices seemed so natural that they were
very willing to let them pass out of mind. It is in the works of those
who, while sympathising with Italy, are not Italians, that the best record
of it is to be found; nowhere better than in a recent book by a French
writer, M. Paul Bourget, in which occurs the following just and eloquent
tribute: 'We must say in praise of the aristocracy on this side of the
Alps that the best soldiers of independence were nobles. If Italy owes the
final success to the superior capabilities of Victor Emmanuel and Cavour,
and to the agitating power of the General of the Thousand, it is well not
to forget the struggles sustained for years by gentlemen whose example did
so much to raise partisans among the humble. These aristocrats, passionate
for liberty, have (like our own of the eighteenth century) done more for
the people than the people itself. The veritable history of this <i>
Risorgimento</i> would be in great part that of the Italian nobility in
which the heroic blood of feudal chiefs revolted against the oppressions
and, above all, the perpetual humiliation, born of the presence of the
stranger.'</p>

<p>When Prince Metternich looked beyond the borders of those provinces
which he said that his Sovereign did not intend to lose, he saw sooner
than most people that a ball was set rolling which would not stop half way
down the hill. The one element in the situation which came as a surprise
to him, was that introduced by Pius IX. 'A liberal Pope is an impossible
being!' he exclaimed. <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_86" id=
"Page_86">[Pg.86]</a></span> Nevertheless this impossible being was a
reality which had to be dealt with. He hoped all along, however, that Pius
would fall a victim to the Frankenstein he had called into existence, and
his only real anxiety lay where it had always lain&mdash;on the side of
Piedmont. 'Charles Albert ought to let us know,' he wrote to the Austrian
Minister at Turin, 'whether his reign has been only a mask under which was
hidden the Prince of Carignano, who ascended the throne through the order
of succession re-established in his favour by the Emperor Francis.'
Considering all things, the endeavour to make it appear that the King was
indebted for his crown to Austria was somewhat venturesome. Charles
Albert, Metternich went on to say, had to choose between two systems, the
system now in force, or 'the crassest revolution.' He wrote again: 'The
King is sliding back upon the path which he enters for the second time in
his life, <i>and which he will never really quit</i>.' Words of a bitter
enemy, but juster than the 'Esecrato o Carignano,' hurled for a quarter of
a century at Charles Albert by those who only saw in him a traitor.</p>

<p>The constant invocation of the revolutionary spectre by the Austrian
statesman convinced the King that the wish was father to the thought, and,
afraid of introducing the thin end of the wedge, he showed himself more
than ever averse to reforming the antiquated machinery of the Sardinian
Government. Instead of being the first of Italian princes to yield to
popular demands, he was almost the last. He believed that the question of
nationality, of independence, could be separated from the question of free
institutions. Of all the chimerical ideas then afloat, this was the most
chimerical. Even the example of the Pope, for whom Charles Albert felt a
romantic devotion, <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">
[Pg.87]</a></span> was not enough to induce him to open the road to
reforms. The person who seems first to have impressed him with their
absolute necessity was Lord Minto, whose visit to Turin, in October 1847,
coincided with the dismissal of Count della Margherita, the minister most
closely associated with the absolutist and Jesuitical <i>
r&eacute;gime</i>. Lord Minto was sent to Italy to encourage in the ways
of political virtue those Italian princes who were not entirely
incorrigible. His mission excited exaggerated hopes on the part of the
Liberals, and exaggerated wrath in the retrograde party&mdash;both failing
to understand its limitations. The hopes died a natural death, but long
afterwards, reactionary writers attributed all the 'troubles' in Italy to
this estimable British diplomatist. What is not doubtful is, that,
accustomed as they were to being lectured and bullied by foreign courts,
the Italians derived the greatest encouragement from the openly expressed
sympathy of well-known English visitors, whether they came in an official
capacity like Lord Minto, or unofficially like Mr Cobden, who travelled as
a missionary of Free Trade, and was received with rapture&mdash;with
which, it is to be feared, Free Trade had little to do&mdash;by the
leading Liberals in Italy: Massimo d'Azeglio at Genoa, Mancini at Naples
Cavour and Scialoja at Turin, Minghetti at Bologna, Ridolfi at Florence,
and Manin and Tommaseo at Venice.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1847, there was a curious shuffling of the cards in
the small states of Lucca and Parma, resulting in much irritation, which,
in an atmosphere so charged with revolutionary electricity, was not
without importance. The dissolute Bourbon prince who reigned in Lucca,
Charles Ludovico, had but one desire, which was to increase his civil
list. He hit upon an English jockey named Ward, who came to <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg.88]</a></span> Italy in the
service of a German count, and this person he made his Chancellor of the
Exchequer. By various luminous strokes, Ward furthered his Sovereign's
object without much increasing the taxation, and when matters began to
grow complicated, and here, too, a cry was raised for a Constitution
(which had been solemnly guaranteed to the people of Lucca at the Congress
of Vienna, but had never been heard of since), he proposed the sale of the
Duchy off-hand to Tuscany, with which it would, in any case, be united,
when, on the death of the ex-Empress Marie-Louise, the Duchy of Parma
devolved on the Duke of Lucca. At the same time, by a prior agreement, a
district of Tuscany called the Lunigiana was consigned, one-half to the
Duchess of Parma, and the other to the Duke of Modena. The indignation of
the population, which was made, by force, subject to the Duke of Modena,
was intense, and the whole transaction of handing about Italians to suit
the pleasure of princes, or to obey the articles of forgotten treaties,
reminded the least sensitive of the everyday opprobrium of their lot.</p>

<p>The bargain with Tuscany had been struck only eight days when
Marie-Louise died&mdash;unlamented, since the latter years of her reign
formed a sad contrast to the earlier. Marie-Louise had not a bad
disposition, but she always let her husband of the hour govern as he
chose; of the four or five of these husbands, the last two, and
particularly the hated Count de Bombelles, undid all the good done by
their more humane predecessors. The Parmese petitioned their new Duke to
send the man away, and to grant them some measure of freedom. The answer
he gave was the confirmation of Bombelles in all his honours, and the
conclusion of a treaty with Austria, securing the assistance of her arms.
A military force had been sent to Parma to escort the <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg.89]</a></span> body of the
late Duchess to Vienna; but on the principle that the living are of more
consequence than the dead, it remained there to protect the new Duke from
his subjects. Marie-Louise and her lovers, Charles Ludovico and his
jockey-minister, are instructive illustrations of the scandalous point
things had reached in the small states of Italy.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, one state in which, though the dynasty was Austrian,
the government was conducted without ferocity and without scandal. This
was Tuscany. The branch of the Hapsburg-Lorraine family established in
Tuscany produced a series of rulers who, if they exhibited no magnificent
qualities, were respectable as individuals, and mild as rulers. Giusti
dubbed Leopold II. 'the Tuscan Morpheus, crowned with poppies and lettuce
leaves,' and the clear intelligence of Ricasoli was angered by the
languid, let-be policy of the Grand-Ducal government, but, compared with
the other populations of Italy, the Tuscans might well deem themselves
fortunate. Only on one occasion had the Grand Duke given up a fugitive
from the more favoured provinces, and the presence of distinguished exiles
lent brilliancy to his capital. Leopold II. hesitated between the desire
to please his subjects and the fear of his Viennese relations, who sent
him through Metternich the ominous reminder, 'that the Italian Governments
had only subsisted for the last ten years by the support they received
from Austria'&mdash;an assertion at which Charles Albert took umbrage, but
he was curtly told that he was not intended. In spite of his fears,
however, the Grand Duke instituted a National Guard on the 4th of
September, which was correctly judged the augury of further concessions.
In August, the Austrian Minister had distinctly threatened to occupy
Tuscany, or any other of the Italian duchies <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg.90]</a></span> where a National Guard was
granted; its institution was therefore interpreted as a decisive act of
rebellion against the Imperial dictatorship. The red, white and green
tricolor, not yet permitted in Piedmont, floated already from all the
towers of the city on the Arno.</p>

<p>Where there were no signs of improvement was in the government of the
Two Sicilies. King Ferdinand undertook a journey through several parts of
the country, but as Lord Napier, the British Minister, expressed it:
'Exactly where the grace of the royal countenance was principally
conferred, the rebels sprung up most thickly.' A revolution was planned to
break out in all the cities of the kingdom, but the project only took
effect at Messina and at Reggio, and in both places the movement was
stifled with prompt and barbarous severity. When the leader of the
Calabrian attempt, Domenico Romeo, a landed proprietor, was caught on the
heights of Aspromonte, his captors, after cutting off his head, carried it
to his young nephew, whom they ordered to take it to Reggio with the cry
of 'Long live the King.' The youth refused, and was immediately killed. In
the capital, Carlo Poerio and many patriots were thrown into prison on
suspicion. Settembrini had just time to escape to Malta.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h4>THE YEAR OF REVOLUTION</h4>

<h5>1848</h5>

<h5>Insurrection in Sicily&mdash;The Austrians expelled from Milan and
Venice &mdash;Charles Albert takes the Field&mdash;Withdrawal of the Pope
and King of Naples&mdash;Piedmont defeated&mdash;The Retreat.</h5>

<p><br />
 On the 12th of January, the birthday of the King of the Two Sicilies,
another insurrection broke out in Sicily; this time it was serious indeed.
The City of the Vespers lit the torch which set Europe on fire.</p>

<p>So began the year of revolution which was to see the kings of the earth
flying, with or without umbrellas, and the principle of monarchy more
shaken by the royal see-saw of submission and vengeance than ever it was
by the block of Whitehall or the guillotine of the Place Louis XV.</p>

<p>In Italy, the errors and follies of that year were not confined to
princes and governments, but it will remain memorable as the time when the
Italian nation, not a dreamer here or there, or a handful of heroic
madmen, or an isolated city, but the nation as a whole, with an unanimity
new in history, asserted its right and its resolve to exist.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg.92]</a></span>
King Ferdinand sent 5000 soldiers to 'make a garden,' as he described it,
of Palermo, if the offers sent at the same time failed to pacify the
inhabitants. These offers were refused with the comment: 'Too late,' and
the Palermitans prepared to resist to the death under the guidance of the
veteran patriot Ruggiero Settimo, Prince of Fitalia. 'Separation,' they
said, 'or our English Constitution of 1812.' Increased irritation was
awakened by the discovery in the head office of the police at Palermo of a
secret room full of skeletons, which were supposed to belong to persons
privately murdered. The Neapolitans were compelled to withdraw with a loss
of 3000 men, but before they went, the general in command let out 4000
convicts, who had been kept without food for forty-eight hours. The
convicts, however, did not fulfil the intentions of their liberator, and
did but little mischief. Not so the Neapolitan troops, who committed
horrors on the peasantry as they retreated, which provoked acts of
retaliation almost as barbarous. In a short time all Sicily was in its own
hands except the citadel of Messina.</p>

<p>It is not possible to follow the Sicilians in their long struggle for
their autonomy. They stood out for some fourteen months. An English
Blue-book is full of the interminable negotiations conducted by Lord
Napier and the Earl of Minto in the hope of bringing the strife to an end.
When the parliament summoned by the revolutionary government declared the
downfall of the House of Bourbon, all the stray princes in Europe,
including Louis Napoleon, were reviewed as candidates for the throne. The
choice fell on the Duke of Genoa; it was well received in England, and the
British men-of-war were immediately ordered to salute the Sicilian flag.
But the Duke's reign never became a reality. <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg.93]</a></span> After an heroic struggle,
the islanders were subjugated in the spring of 1849.</p>

<p>So stout a fight for independence must win admiration, if not approval.
The political reasons against the course taken by the Sicilians have been
suggested in a former chapter. In separating their lot from that of
Naples, in rejecting even freedom unless it was accompanied by disruption,
they hastened the ruin of the Neapolitans and of themselves, and surely
played into the hands of the crafty tyrant who desired nothing better than
to fish in the troubled waters of his subjects' dissensions.</p>

<p>In the gathering storm of January 1848, the first idea that occurred to
Ferdinand II. was the good old plan of calling in Austrian assistance. But
the Austrians were told by Pius IX. that he would not allow their troops
to pass through his territory. Had they attempted to pass in spite of his
warning, events would have taken a different turn, as the Pope would have
been driven into a war with Austria then and there; perhaps he would have
been glad, as weak people commonly are, of the compulsion to do what he
dared not do without compulsion. The Austrian Government was too wise to
force a quarrel; it was easy to lock up Austrian subjects for crying 'Viva
Pio Nono,' but the enormous importance of keeping the Head of the Church,
if possible, in a neutral attitude could not be overlooked. All thoughts
of going to Ferdinand's help were politely abandoned, and he, seeing
himself in a defenceless position, and pondering deeply on the upsetting
of Louis Philippe's throne, which was just then the latest news, decided
on that device, dear to all political conjurors, which is known as taking
the wind out of your enemy's sails. The Pope, the Grand Duke of <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg.94]</a></span> Tuscany
and the King of Sardinia, had worried him for six months with admonitions.
'Very well,' he now said; 'they urge me forward, I will precipitate them.'
Constitution, representative government, unbridled liberty of the press, a
civic guard, the expulsion of the Jesuits; what mattered a trifle more or
less when everything could be revoked at the small expense of perjury?
Ferdinand posed to perfection in the character of Citizen King. He
reassured those who ventured to show the least signs of apprehension by
saying: 'If I had not intended to carry out the Statute, I should not have
granted it.'</p>

<p>Not many days later, the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the King of Sardinia
each promulgated a Charter. In the case of Charles Albert, it had been
formally promised on the 8th of February, after sleepless nights, severe
fasts, much searching of the heart&mdash;contrasting strangely with the
gay transformation scene at Naples; but promises have a more serious
meaning to some persons than to others. Nor did Charles Albert take any
pleasure in the shouts of a grateful people. 'Born in revolution,' he once
wrote, 'I have traversed all its phases, and I know well enough what
popularity is worth&mdash;<i>viva</i> to-day, <i>morte</i> to-morrow.'</p>

<p>In the Lombardo-Venetian provinces all seemed still quiet, but the
brooding discontent of the masses increased with the increasing
aggressiveness of the Austrian soldiers, while the refusal to grant the
studiously moderate demands of men like Nazari of Bergamo and Manin and
Tommasco of Venice, who were engaged in a campaign of legal agitation,
brought conviction to the most cautious that no measure of political
liberty was obtainable under Austrian rule.</p>

<p>At the Scala Theatre some of the audience had raised cries of 'Viva Pio
Nono' during a performance of <i>I Lombardi.</i><a name="FNanchor3"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> This was the excuse <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg.95]</a></span> for
prohibiting every direct or indirect public reference to the reigning
Pontiff. Nevertheless, a few young men were caught singing the Pope's
hymn, upon which the military charged the crowd. On the 3rd of January the
soldiers fell on the people in the Piazza San Carlo, killing six and
wounding fifty-three. The parish priest of the Duomo said that he had seen
Russians, French and Austrians enter Milan as invaders; but a scene like
that of the 3rd of January he had never witnessed; 'they simply murdered
in the streets.'</p>

<p>The <i>Judicium Statuarium</i>, equivalent to martial law, was
proclaimed in February; but the Viennese revolution of the 8th of March,
and Prince Metternich's flight to England, were followed by promises to
abolish the censure, and to convoke the central congregations of the
Lombardo-Venetian kingdom. The utmost privilege of these assemblies was
consultative. In 1815 they were invested with the right to 'make known
grievances,' but they had only once managed to perform this modest
function. It was hardly worth while to talk about them on the 18th of
March 1848.</p>

<p>On the morning of that day, Count O'Donnel, the Vice-Governor of Milan,
announced the Emperor's concessions. Before night he was the hostage of
the revolution, signing whatever decrees were demanded of him till in a
few hours even his signature was dispensed with. The Milanese had begun
their historic struggle.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg.96]</a></span>
Taking refuge in the Citadel, Radetsky wrote to the Podest&agrave;, Count
Gabrio Casati (brother of Teresa Confalonieri), that he acknowledged no
authority at Milan except his own and that of his soldiers. Those who
resisted would be guilty of high treason. If arguments did not avail, he
would make use of all the means placed in his hands by an army of 100,000
men to bring the rebel city to obedience. Unhappily for Radetsky, there
were not any such 100,000 men in Italy, though long before this he had
told Metternich that he could not guarantee the safety of Lombardy with
less than 150,000. In spite of partial reinforcements, the number did not
amount to more than from 72,000 to 75,000, while at Milan it stood at
between 15,000 and 20,000. But if we take the lower estimate, 15,000
regular troops under such a commander, who, most rare in similar
emergencies, knew his own mind, and had no thought except the recovery of
the town for his Sovereign, constituted a formidable force against a
civilian population, which began the fight with only a few hundred
fowling-pieces. The odds on the side of Austria were tremendous.</p>

<p>If the Milan revolt had been one of the customary revolutions, arranged
with the help of pen and paper, its first day would have been certainly
its last. But even more than the Sicilian Vespers, it was the
unpremeditated, irresistible act of a people sick of being slaves. At the
beginning Casati tried to restrain it; so, with equal or still stronger
endeavours, did the republican Carlo Cattaneo, whose influence was great.
'You have no arms,' he said again and again. Not a single man of weight
took upon himself the awful responsibility of urging the unarmed masses
upon so desperate an enterprise; but when the die was cast none held back.
Initiated by the populace, the revolt <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg.97]</a></span> was led to its victorious close
by the nerve and ability of the influential men who directed its
course.</p>

<p>Towards nightfall on the 18th, during which day there had been only
scuffles between the soldiers and the people, Radetsky took the Broletto,
where the Municipality sat, after a two hours' siege, and sent forthwith a
special messenger to the Emperor with the news that the revolution was on
a fair way to being completely crushed. Meanwhile, he massed his troops at
all the entrances to the city, so that at dawn he might strangle the
insurrection by a concentric movement, as in a noose. The plan was good;
but to-morrow does not belong even to the most experienced of
Field-Marshals.</p>

<p>In all quarters of the city barricades sprang up like mushrooms.
Everything went, freely given, to their construction; the benches of the
Scala, the beds of the young seminarists, the court carriages, found
hidden in a disused church, building materials of the half-finished
Palazzo d'Adda, grand pianofortes, valuable pieces of artistic furniture,
and the old kitchen table of the artisan. Before the end of the fight the
barricades numbered 1523. Young nobles, dressed in the velvet suits then
in vogue, cooks in their white aprons, even women and children, rushed to
the defence of the improvised fortifications. Luciano Manara and other
heroes, who afterwards fell at Rome, were there to lead. In the first
straits for want of arms the museums of the Uboldi and Poldi-Pozzoli
families were emptied of their rare treasures by permission of the owners;
the crowd brandished priceless old swords and specimens of early firearms.
More serviceable weapons were obtained by degrees from the Austrian killed
and wounded, and from the public offices which fell into their hands.
Bolza, long the hated agent of the Austrian police, was discovered by
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg.98]</a></span>
the people, but they did not harm him. Throughout the five days, the
Milanese showed a forbearance which was the more admirable, because there
can be no doubt that when the Austrians found they were getting the worst
of it, they vented their rage in deplorable outrages on non-combatants.
That Radetsky was personally to blame for these excesses has never been
alleged, and it was perhaps beyond the power of the officers to keep
discipline among soldiers who, towards the end, were wild with panic.</p>

<p>'The very foundations of the city were torn up,' wrote the
Field-Marshal in his official report; 'not hundreds, but thousands of
barricades crossed the streets. Such circumspection and audacity were
displayed that it was evident military leaders were at the head of the
people. The character of the Milanese had become quite changed. Fanaticism
had seized every rank and age and both sexes.'</p>

<p>As always happens with street-fighting, the number of the slain has
never been really known; the loss of the citizens was small compared with
that of the Austrians, who, according to some authorities, lost 5000,
between killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Radetsky ordered the evacuation of the town and citadel on the night of
Wednesday, the 22nd of March. The Milanese had won much more than
freedom&mdash;they had won the right to it. And what they had done they
had done alone. When the news that the capital was up in arms spread
through Lombardy, there was but one gallant impulse, to fly to its aid.
But the earliest to arrive, Giuseppe Martinengo Cesaresco, with his troop
of Brescian peasants, found when he reached Milan that they were a few
hours too late to share in the last shots fired upon the retreating
Austrians.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg.99]</a></span>
Nowhere, except in Milan, did the revolution meet with a Radetsky. The
Austrian authorities became convinced that their position was untenable,
and they desired to avoid a useless sacrifice of life. This, rather than
cowardly fears, was the motive which induced Count Palffy and Count Zichy,
the civil and military governors of Venice, to yield the city without
deluging it in blood. The latter had been guilty of negligence in leaving
the Venetian arsenal in charge of troops so untrustworthy that Manin could
take it on the 22nd of March by a simple display of his own courage, and
without striking a blow, but after this first success on the side of the
revolution, which supplied the people with an unlimited stock of arms and
ammunition, the Austrians did well to give way even from their own point
of view. At seven o'clock on the evening of the 22nd of March, the famous
capitulation was signed. Manin's prediction of the previous day,
'To-morrow the city will be in my power, or I shall be dead,' had been
realised in the first alternative.</p>

<p>Daniel Manin, who was now forty-four years of age, was by profession a
lawyer, by race a Jew. His father became a Christian, and, according to
custom, took the surname of his godfather, who belonged to the family of
the last Doge of Venice. Manin and the Dalmatian scholar, Niccol&ograve;
Tommaseo, had been engaged in patiently adducing proof after proof that
Austria did not even abide by her own laws when the expression of
political opinion was concerned. At the beginning of the revolution they
were in prison, and Palffy's first act of surrender was to set them free.
Henceforth Manin was undisputed lord of the city. It is strange how, all
at once, a man who was only slightly known to the world should have been
chosen as spokesman and ruler. It did not, however, happen by chance. The
people in Italy are observant; <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_100"
id="Page_100">[Pg.100]</a></span> the Venetians had observed Manin, and
they trusted him. The power of inspiring trust was what gave this Jewish
lawyer his ascendancy, not the talents which usually appeal to the masses.
He had not the advantage of an imposing presence, for he was short,
slight, with blue eyes and bushy hair; in all things he was the opposite
to a demagogue; he never beguiled, or flattered, or told others what he
did not believe himself. But, on his side, he <i>knew</i> the people, whom
most revolutionary leaders know not at all. 'That is my sole merit,' he
used to say. It was that which enabled him to cleanse Venice from the
stain of having bartered her freedom for the smile of a conqueror, and
give her back the name and inheritance of 'eldest child of liberty.'</p>

<p>It was a matter of course that emancipated Venice should assume a
republican form of government. Here the republic was a restoration. At
Milan the case was different; there were two parties, that of Cattaneo,
which was strongly republican, that of Casati, which was strongly
monarchical. There was a third party, which thought of nothing except of
never again seeing a soldier with a white coat. By mutual agreement, the
Provisional Government declared that the decision as to the form of
government should be left to calmer days. For a time this compromise
produced satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The revolution gained ground. Francis of Modena executed a rapid
flight, and the Duke of Parma presently followed him. By the end of March,
Lombardy and Venetia were free, saving the fortresses of the
Quadrilateral. The exception was of far greater moment than, in the
enchantment of the hour, anyone dreamt of confessing. Mantua, Legnano,
Peschiera and Verona were so many cities of refuge to the flying Austrian
troops, where they could rest in safety and nurse their strength. <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg.101]</a></span>
Still, the results achieved were great, almost incredible; with the
expectation that Rome, Naples, Tuscany and Piedmont would send their
armies to consolidate the work already done, it was natural to think that,
whatever else might happen, Austrian dominion was a thing of the past.
Alessandro Bixio (brother of the General), who was a naturalised
Frenchman, wrote to the French Government on the 7th of April from Turin:
'In the ministries, in meetings, in the streets, you only see and hear
people to whom the question of Italian independence seems to be one of
those historical questions about which the time is past for talking.
According to the general opinion, Austria is nothing but a phantom, and
the army of Radetsky a shadow.' Such were the hopes that prevailed. They
were vain, but they did not appear so then.</p>

<p>Pius IX. seemed to throw in his lot definitely with the revolution
when, on the 19th of March, he too granted a Constitution, having
previously formed a lay ministry, which included Marco Minghetti and Count
Pasolini, under the presidency of Cardinal Antonelli, who thus makes his
first appearance as Liberal Premier. That the Roman Constitution was an
unworkable attempt to reconcile lay and ecclesiastical pretensions, that
the proposed Chamber of Deputies, which was not to make laws affecting
education, religious corporations, the registration of births and
marriages; or to confer civil rights on non-catholics, or to touch the
privileges and immunities of the clergy, might have suited
Cloud-cuckoo-town, but would not suit the solid earth, were facts easy to
recognise, but no one had time to pause and consider. It was sufficient to
hear Pius proclaim that in the wind which was uprooting oaks and cedars
might be clearly distinguished the Voice of the Lord. Such utterances,
mingled <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">
[Pg.102]</a></span> with blessings on Italy, brought balm to patriotic
souls. The Liberals had no fear that the Pope would veto the participation
of his troops in the national war, for they were blind to the
complications with which a fighting Pope would find himself embarrassed in
the middle of the nineteenth century. But the other party discerned these
complications from the first, and knew what use to make of them.</p>

<p>The powers of reaction had only to catch hold of a perfectly modern
sentiment, the doctrine that ecclesiastics should be men of peace, in
order to dissipate the myth of a Pope liberator. It was beside the
question that, from the moment he accepted such a doctrine, the Pope
condemned the institution of prince-bishoprics, of which he represented
the last survival. Nor was it material that, if he adopted it, consistency
should have made him carry it to its logical consequence of
non-resistance. By aid of this theory of a peaceful Pontiff, with the
threat, in reserve, of a schism, Austria felt confident that she could
avoid the enormous moral inconvenience of a Pope in arms against her.</p>

<p>Either, however, the full force of the influence which caused Pius IX.
to draw back was not brought to bear till somewhat late in the day, or the
part acted by him during the months of March and April can be hardly
acquitted of dissimulation. War preparations were continued, with the warm
co-operation of the Cardinal President of the Council, and when General
Durando started for the frontier with 17,000 men, he would have been a
bold man who had said openly in Rome that they were intended not to
fight.</p>

<p>While the Pope was still supposed to favour the war, Ferdinand of
Naples did not dare to oppose the enthusiasm of his subjects, and the
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg.103]</a></span>
demand that a Neapolitan contingent should be sent to Lombardy. The first
relay of troops actually started, but the generals had secret orders to
take the longest route, and to lose as much time as possible.</p>

<p>Tuscany had a very small army, but such assistance as she could give
was both promised and given. The fate of the Tuscan corps of 6000 men will
be related hereafter. The Grand Duke Leopold identified himself with the
Italian cause with more sincerity than was to be found at Rome or Naples;
still, the material aid that he could offer counted as next to
nothing.</p>

<p>There remained Piedmont and Charles Albert. Now was the time for the
army which he had created (for Charles Felix left no army worthy of the
name) to assert upon the Lombard fields the reason of its existence. War
with Austria was declared on the 23rd of March. It was midnight; a vast
crowd waited in silence in Piazza Castello. At last the windows of the
palace were opened, a sudden flood of light from within illuminating the
scene. Charles Albert stepped upon the balcony between his two sons. He
was even paler than usual, but a smile such as no one had seen before was
on his lips. He waved the long proscribed tricolor slowly over the heads
of the people.</p>

<p>The King said in his proclamation that 'God had placed Italy in a
position to provide for herself ('in grado di fare da s&egrave;'). Hence
the often repeated phrase: 'L'Italia far&agrave; da s&egrave;.' He told
the Lombard delegates, who met him at Pavia that he would not enter their
capital, which had shown such signal valour, till after he had won a
victory. He declared to all that his only aim was to complete the splendid
work of liberation so happily begun; questions of government would be
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg.104]</a></span>
reserved for the conclusion of the war. Joy was the order of the day, but
the fatal mistakes of the campaign had already commenced; there had been
inexcusable delay in declaring war; if it was pardonable to wait for the
Milanese initiative, it was as inexpedient as it seemed ungenerous to wait
till the issue of the struggle at Milan was decided. Then, after the
declaration of war, considering that the Sardinian Government must have
seen its imminence for weeks, and indeed for months, there was more time
lost than ought to have been the case in getting the troops under weigh.
Still, at the opening of the campaign, two grand possibilities were left.
The first was obviously to cut Radetsky off in his painful retreat,
largely performed along country by-roads, as he had to avoid the principal
cities which were already free. Had Charles Albert caught him up while he
was far from the Quadrilateral, the decisive blow would have been struck,
and the only man who could save Austria in Italy would have been taken
prisoner. Radetsky chose the route of Lodi and the lower Brescian plains
to Montechiaro, where the encampments were ready for the Austrian spring
manoeuvres: from this point an easy march carried him under the walls of
Verona. Here he met General d'Aspre, who had just arrived with the
garrison of Padua. D'Aspre, by skill and resolution, had brought his men
from Padua without losing one, having refused the Paduans arms for a
national guard, though ordered from Milan to grant them. 'You come to tell
me all is lost,' said the Field-Marshal when they met 'No,' rejoined the
younger general, 'I come to tell you all is saved.'</p>

<p>This great chance missed, there was another which could have been
seized. Mantua, extraordinary to relate, was defended by only three
hundred artillerymen and a handful of hussars. It would have fallen <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg.105]</a></span> into
the hands of its own citizens but for the presence of mind of its
commandant, the Polish General Gorzhowsky, who told them that to no one on
earth would he deliver the keys of the fortress except to his Emperor, and
that the moment he could no longer defend it he would blow it into the
air, with himself and half Mantua. He showed them the flint and the steel
with which he intended to do the deed. Enemy though he was, that incident
ought to be recorded in letters of gold on the gates of Mantua, as a
perpetual lesson of that most difficult thing for a country founded in
revolution to learn: the meaning of a soldier's duty.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that, if Charles Albert had made an immediate dash on
Mantua, the fortress, or its ruins, would have been his, to the enormous
detriment of the Austrian position. But this chance too was missed. On the
31st of March, the 9000 men sent with all speed by Radetsky to the
defenceless fortress arrived, and henceforth Mantua was safe. Charles
Albert only got within fifteen or sixteen miles of it five days later, to
find that all hope of its capture was gone.</p>

<p>The campaign began with political as well as with military mistakes. At
the same time that the King of Sardinia was declaring in the Proclamation
addressed to the Lombards that, full of admiration of the glorious feats
performed in their capital, he came to their aid as brother to brother,
friend to friend, his ambassadors were trying to persuade the foreign
Powers, and especially Austria, Prussia and Russia, that the only object
of the war was to avoid a revolution in Piedmont, and to prevent the
establishment of a republic in Lombardy. No one was convinced or placated
by these assurances; far better as policy than so ignominious an attempt
at hedging would have been the <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_106"
id="Page_106">[Pg.106]</a></span> acknowledgment to all the world of the
noble crime of patriotism. But, as Massimo d'Azeglio once observed,
Charles Albert had the incurable defect of thinking himself cunning. It
was, moreover, only too true that, although in these diplomatic
communications the King allowed the case against him to be stated with
glaring exaggeration, yet they contained an element of fact. He <i>was</i>
afraid of revolution at home; he <i>was</i> afraid of a Lombard republic;
these were not the only, nor were they the strongest, motives which drove
him into the war, but they were motives which, associated with deeper
causes, contributed to the disasters of the future.</p>

<p>The Piedmontese force was composed of two <i>corps d'arm&eacute;e,</i>
the first under General Bava and the second under General Sonnaz: each
amounted to 24,000 men. The reserves, under the Duke of Savoy, numbered
12,000. Radetsky, at first (after strengthening the garrisons in the
fortresses), could not put into the field more than 40,000 men. As has
been stated, the King assumed the supreme command, which led to a constant
wavering between the original plan of General Bava, a capable officer, and
the criticisms and suggestions of the staff. The greatest mistake of all,
that of never bringing into the field at once more than about half the
army, was not without connection with the supposed necessity, based on
political reasons, of garrisoning places in the rear which might have been
safely left to the care of their national guards.</p>

<p>Besides the royal army, there were in the field 17,000 Romans, 3000
Modenese and Parmese, and 6000 Tuscans. There were also several companies
of Lombard volunteers, Free Corps, as they were called, which might have
been increased to almost any extent had they not been discouraged by the
King, who was believed to look coldly on all these <span class="newpage">
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg.107]</a></span> extraneous allies,
either from doubt of their efficiency, or from the wish to keep the whole
glory of the campaign for his Piedmontese army.</p>

<p>The first engagements were on the line of the Mincio. On the 8th of
April the Sardinians carried the bridge of Goito after a fight of four
hours. The burning of the village of Castelnuovo on the 12th, as a
punishment for its having received Manara's band of volunteers, excited
great exasperation; many of the unfortunate villagers perished in the
flames, and this and other incidents of the same kind did much towards
awakening a more vivid hatred of the Austrians among the peasants.</p>

<p>After easily gaining possession of the left (Venetian) bank of the
Mincio, Charles Albert employed himself in losing time over chimerical
operations with a view to taking the fortresses of Peschiera and Mantua,
now strongly garrisoned, and impregnable while their provisions lasted.
This object governed the conduct of the campaign, and caused the waste of
precious months during every day of which General Nugent, with his 30,000
men, was approaching one step nearer from the mountains of Friuli, and
General Welden, with his 10,000, down the passes of Tyrol. If, instead of
playing at sieges, Charles Albert had cut off these reinforcements,
Radetsky would have been rendered powerless, and the campaign would have
had another termination. Never was there a war in which the adoption of
Napoleon's system of crushing his opponents one by one, when he could not
outnumber them if united, was more clearly indicated.</p>

<p>General Durando crossed the Po on the 21st of April with 17,000 men,
partly Pontifical troops and partly volunteers, to which weak corps fell
the task of opposing Nugent's advance in Venetia. The colours of the
Pontifical troops were solemnly blessed before they left Rome, but <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg.108]</a></span> as
the order was only given to go to the frontier, and nothing was said,
though everything was understood, about crossing it, the Pope was
technically able to assert that the war was none of his making. His
ministry ventured to suggest to him that the situation was peculiar. Now
it was that Catholic Austria and Russia, herself schismatic, flourished in
the face of the Pope the portentous scare of a new schism. It is said that
the Pope's confessor, a firm Liberal, died just at this time, not without
suspicion of poison. Thoroughly alarmed in his spiritual capacity, the
Pope issued his Encyclical Letter of the 29th of April&mdash;when his
ministers and the whole country still hoped from day to day that he would
formally declare war&mdash;in which he protested that his sacred office
obliged him to embrace all nations in an equal paternal love. If his
subjects, he added, followed the example of the other Italians, he could
not help it: a half-hearted admission which could not mitigate the
indignation which the document called forth. With regard to Durando's
corps, the Pope did what was the best thing under the altered
circumstances; he sent L.C. Farini as envoy to the King of Sardinia, with
the request that he would take the Roman troops under his supreme command,
the Papal Government agreeing to continue the pay of such of them as
belonged to the regular army. Pius IX. made one last effort to help his
fellow-countrymen which people hardly noticed, so futile did it appear,
but which was probably made in profound seriousness. He wrote a letter to
the Emperor of Austria begging him to make all things right and pleasant
by voluntarily withdrawing from his Italian dominions. Popes had dictated
to sovereigns before now; was there not Canossa? Besides, if a miracle was
sought, why should not a miracle <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109">[Pg.100]</a></span> happen? Pope and Emperor shaking hands
over a free Italy and a world reconciled&mdash;how delightful the
prospect! Who can doubt that when the Pope wrote that letter all the
beautiful dreams of Cardinal Mastai carried him once more away (it was the
last time) in an ecstasy of blissful hopes? 'Let not your Majesty take
offence,' ran the appeal, 'if we turn to your pity and religion, exhorting
you with fatherly affection to desist from a war which, powerless to
re-conquer the hearts of the Lombards and Venetians, can only lead to a
dark series of calamities. Nor let the generous Germanic nation take
offence if we invite it to abandon old hatreds, and convert into useful
relations of friendly neighbourhood a dominion which can be neither noble
nor happy if it depend only on the sword. Thus we trust in the nation
itself, honestly proud of its own nationality, to no longer make a point
of honour of sanguinary attempts against the Italian nation, but rather to
perceive that its true honour lies in recognising Italy as a sister.'</p>

<p>The Emperor received the bearer of the letter with coldness, and
referred him to his ministers, who simply called his attention to the fact
that the Pope owed the Temporal Power to the same treaties as those which
gave Austria the possession of Lombardy and Venetia.</p>

<p>The day after the publication of the Encyclical, that is to say, the
30th of April, the Piedmontese obtained their first important success in
the battle of Pastrengo, near Peschiera. Fighting from daybreak to
sundown, they drove the enemy back into Verona, with a loss of 1200 killed
and wounded. The Austrians were in rather inferior numbers; but the
victory was highly creditable to the hitherto untried army of Piedmont,
and showed that it contained excellent fighting material. It <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg.110]</a></span> was not
followed up, and might nearly as well have never been fought.</p>

<p>The Neapolitan troops, of whom 41,000 were promised, 17,000 being on
the way already, were intended to reinforce Durando's corps in Venetia.
With the two or three battalions which Manin could spare from the little
army of Venice, the Italian forces opposed to Nugent's advance would have
been brought up to 60,000 men; in which case not even Charles Albert's
'masterly inactivity' could have given Austria the victory.</p>

<p>The Neapolitan Parliament convoked under the new Constitution was to
meet on the 15th of May. A dispute had been going on for several days
between the Sovereign and the deputies about the form of the parliamentary
oath, the deputies wishing that the Chambers should be left free to amend
or alter the Statute, while the King desired that they should be bound by
oath to maintain it as it was presented to them. It was unwise to provoke
a disagreement which was sure to irritate the King. However, late on the
14th, he appeared to yield, and consented that the wording of the oath
should be referred to the discussion of Parliament itself. It seems that,
at the same time, he ordered the troops of the garrison to take up certain
positions in the city. A colonel of the National Guard raised the cry of
royal treason, calling upon the people to rise, which a portion of them
did, and barricades were constructed in the Toledo and other of the
principal streets. A more insane and culpable thing than this attempt at
revolution was never put in practice. It was worse even than that 20th of
May at Milan, which threw Eugene into the arms of Austria. Its
consequences were those which everyone could have foreseen&mdash;a two
days' massacre in the streets of Naples, begun by the troops and <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg.111]</a></span>
continued by the lazzaroni, who were allowed to pillage to their hearts'
content; the deputies dispersed with threats of violence, Parliament
dissolved before it had sat, the original Statute torn up, and (by far the
most important) the Neapolitan troops, now at Bologna, recalled to Naples.
This was the pretty work of the few hundred reckless rioters on the 15th
of May.</p>

<p>Had not Pius IX. by this time repudiated all part in the war, the King
of the Two Sicilies would have thought twice before he recalled his
contingent, though the counsels of neutrality which he received from
another quarter&mdash;from Lord Palmerston in the name of the English
Government&mdash;strengthened his hand not a little in carrying out a
defection which was the direct ruin of the Italian cause. When the order
to return reached Bologna, the veteran patriot, General Pepe, who had been
summoned from exile to take the chief command, resolved to disobey, and
invited the rest to follow him. Nearly the whole of the troops were,
however, faithful to their military oath. The situation was horrible. The
choice lay between the country in danger and the King, who, false and
perjured though he might be, was still the head of the State, to whom each
soldier had sworn obedience. One gallant officer escaped from the dilemma
by shooting himself. Pepe, with a single battalion of the line, a company
of engineers, and two battalions of volunteers, went to Venice, where they
fought like heroes to the end.</p>

<p>On the 27th of May, Radetsky, taking the offensive with about 40,000
men, marched towards Mantua, near which was stationed the small Tuscan
corps, whose commander only received when too late General Bava's order to
retire from an untenable position. On the 29th the Austrians, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg.112]</a></span> in
overwhelming numbers, bore down upon the 6000 Tuscans at Montanara and
Curtatone, and defeated them after a resistance of six hours. The Tuscan
professor, Giuseppe Montanelli, fell severely wounded while holding the
dead body of his favourite pupil, but he recovered to show less discretion
in politics than he had shown valour in the field.</p>

<p>Peschiera, where the supplies were exhausted, capitulated on the 30th,
and the day after found 22,000 Piedmontese ready to give Radetsky battle
at Goito, whence, after a severe contest, they drove him back to Mantua.
The Austrians lost 3000 out of 25,000 men. The honours of the day fell to
the Savoy brigade, which was worthy of its own fame and of the future King
of Italy, who was slightly wounded while leading it. Outwardly this seemed
the most fortunate period of the war for Charles Albert, but that had
already happened which was to cause the turning of the tide. Nugent, with
his 30,000 men, had joined Radetsky. His march across Venetia was harassed
by the inhabitants, who left him no peace, especially in the mountain
districts, but the poor little force of Romans and volunteers under
Durando and Ferrari was unable to seriously check his progress in the open
country, though he failed in the attempt to take the towns of Treviso and
Vicenza in his passage. The repulse of the Austrians, 18,000 strong, from
Vicenza on the 23rd of May, did great credit to Durando, who only had
10,000 men, most of them <i>Crociati</i>, as the volunteers were called,
whose ideas about fighting were original. It is hard to see how this
General could have done more than he did with the materials at his
disposal, or in what way he merited the abuse which was heaped upon him.
The case would have been very different if his hybrid force had been
supported by the Neapolitan army.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">
[Pg.113]</a></span> Nugent was ordered by Radetsky to let the intermediate
places alone, and to come on to him as fast as circumstances would admit.
The junction of their troops was, the Field-Marshal saw, of vital
necessity, but when this was achieved, and when Welden had also brought
his 15,000 fresh men from Tyrol, he turned his attention to Vicenza,
since, as long as that town remained in Durando's hands, Venetia would
still be free. He conceived the bold plan of making an excursion to
Vicenza with his complete army, while Charles Albert enjoyed the pleasant
illusion that the Austrians were in full retreat owing to his success at
Goito. The result of Radetsky's attack was not doubtful, but the defence
of the town on the 10th of June could not have been more gallant; the 3500
Swiss, the Pontifical Carabineers, and the few other troops belonging to
the regular army of the Pope did wonders. Cialdini, the future general,
and Massimo d'Azeglio, the future prime minister, fought in this action,
and the latter was severely wounded. After several hours' resistance there
was nothing to be done but to hoist the white flag; Radetsky's object was
accomplished, the Venetian <i>terra firma</i> was practically once more in
the power of Austria. On the 14th he was back again at Verona without the
least harm having happened in his absence.</p>

<p>Only military genius of the first order could now have saved the
Piedmontese, and what prevailed was the usual infatuation. Charles
Albert's lines were extended across forty miles of country, from Peschiera
to Goito. On the 23rd of July the Austrians fell upon their weakest point,
and obliged Sonnaz' division to cross over to the right bank of the
Mincio. On the 24th, the King succeeded in dislodging the Austrians from
Custozza after four hours' struggle; but next day, <span class="newpage">
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg.114]</a></span> which was spent
entirely in fighting, Radetsky retook Custozza, and obliged the King to
fall back on Villafranca. Now began the terrible retreat on Milan,
performed under the ceaseless fire of the pursuers, who attacked and
defeated the retreating army for the last time, close to Milan, on the 4th
of August. Radetsky had with him 45,000 men; Charles Albert's forces were
reduced to 25,000. He had lost 5000 since he recrossed the Mincio. He
begged for a truce, and, defeated and undone, he entered the city which he
had vowed should only receive him victorious.</p>

<p>To suppose that anything could have been gained by subjecting Milan to
the horrors of a siege seems at this date the veriest madness; whatever
Charles Albert's sins were, the capitulation of Milan was not among them.
The members of a wild faction, however, demanded resistance to the death,
or the death of the King if he refused. It is their severest censure to
say that their pitiless fury is not excused even by the tragic fate of a
population which, having gained freedom unaided less than six months
before, saw itself given back to its ancestral foe by the man in whom it
had hoped as a saviour. They saw crimes where there were only blunders,
which had brought the King to a pass only one degree less wretched than
their own. Crushed, humiliated, his army half destroyed, his personal
ambition&mdash;to rate no higher the motive of his actions&mdash;trodden
in the dust; and now the name of traitor was hissed in his ears by those
for whom he had made these sacrifices.</p>

<p>Stung to the heart, the King instructed General Bava to tell the
Milanese that if they were ready to bury themselves under the ruins of the
city, he and his sons were ready to do the same. But the Municipality,
convinced of the desperateness of the situation, had <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg.115]</a></span> already
entered into negotiations with Radetsky, by which the capitulation was
ratified. On this becoming known, the Palazzo Greppi, where Charles Albert
lodged, was the object of a new display of rage; an attempt was even made
to set it on fire. During the night, the King succeeded in leaving the
palace on foot, guarded by a company of Bersaglieri and accompanied by his
son, the Duke of Genoa, who, on hearing of his father's critical position,
disobeyed the order to stay with his regiment, and came into the city to
share his danger.</p>

<p>The next day, the 6th of August, the Austrians reentered Milan. They
themselves said that the Milanese seemed distraught. The Municipality was
to blame for having concealed from the people the real state of things, by
publishing reports of imaginary victories. Had the unthinking fury of the
mob ended, as it so nearly ended, in an irreparable crime, the authors of
these falsehoods would have been, more than anyone else, responsible for
the catastrophe.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1848 was finished. From the frontier, Charles Albert
issued a proclamation to his people, calling upon the Piedmontese to
render the common misfortunes less difficult to bear by giving his army a
brotherly reception. 'In its ranks,' he concluded, 'are my sons and I,
ready, as we all are, for new sacrifices, new hardships, or for death
itself for our beloved fatherland.'</p>

<p>The political and diplomatic transactions connected with the war in
Lombardy were the subject after it closed of much discussion, and of some
violent recriminations. Even from the short account given in these pages,
it ought to be apparent that the supreme cause of disaster was simply bad
generalship. Contemporaries, however, judged <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg.116]</a></span> otherwise; if they were
monarchists, they attributed the failure to the want of whole-hearted
co-operation of the Provisional Governments of Lombardy with the
liberating King; if they were republicans, they attributed it to the
King's want of trust in the popular element, and anxiety lest, instead of
receiving an increase of territory, he should find himself confronted with
a new republic at his door. Both parties were so far correct that the
strain of double purposes, or, at least, of incompatible aspirations which
ran through the conduct of affairs, militated against a fortunate ending.
The Piedmontese Government, even had it wished, would have found it
difficult to adhere strictly to the programme of leaving all political
matters for discussion after the war. What actually happened was that the
union, under the not altogether attractive form of Fusion with Piedmont
(instead of in the shape of the formation of an Italian kingdom), was
effected at the end of June and beginning of July over the whole of
Lombardy and Venetia, including Venice, where, perhaps alone, the feeling
against it was not that of a party, but of the bulk of the population.
Manin shared that feeling, but his true patriotism induced him to push on
the Fusion in order to avoid the risk of civil war. He retired into
private life the day it was accomplished, only to become again by
acclamation Head of the State when the reverses of Sardinia obliged the
King's Government to renounce the whole of his scarcely&mdash;acquired
possessions, not excepting Modena, which had been the first, by a
spontaneous plebiscite, to elect him Sovereign.</p>

<p>The diplomatic history of the war is chiefly the history of the efforts
of the English Cabinet to pull up a runaway horse. Lord Minto had been
sent to urge the Italian princes to grant those concessions which Austria
always said (and she was perfectly right) would lead to <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg.117]</a></span> a general
attack upon her power, but when the attack began, the British Government
strained every nerve to limit its extension and diminish its force. That
Lord Palmerston in his own mind disliked Austria, and would have been glad
to see North Italy free, does not alter the fact that he played the
Austrian game, and played it with success. He strongly advised every
Italian prince to abstain from the conflict, and it is further as certain
as anything can well be, that his influence, exercised through Lord
Normanby, alone averted French intervention in August 1848, when the
desperate state of things made the Italians willing to accept foreign aid.
What would have happened if the French had intervened it is interesting to
speculate, but impossible to decide. Their help was not desired, except as
a last resource, by any party in Italy, nor by any man of note except
Manin. The republicans wished Italy to owe her liberation to herself;
Charles Albert wished her to owe it to him. The King also feared a
republican propaganda, and was uneasy, not without reason, about Savoy and
Nice. Lamartine would probably have been satisfied with the former, but it
is doubtful if Charles Albert, though capable of giving up his crown for
Italy, would have been capable of renouncing the cradle of his race. When
Lamartine was succeeded by Cavaignac, perhaps Nice would have been
demanded as well as Savoy. That both the King and Mazzini were right in
mistrusting the sentiments of the French Government, is amply testified by
a letter written by Jules Bastide to the French representative at Turin,
in which the Minister of Foreign Affairs speaks of the danger to France of
the formation of a strong monarchy at the foot of the Alps, that would
tend to assimilate the rest of Italy, adding the significant words: 'We
could admit the unity of <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_118" id=
"Page_118">[Pg.118]</a></span> Italy on the principle and in the form of a
federation of independent states, each balancing the other, but never a
unity which placed the whole of Italy under the dominion of one of these
states.'</p>

<p>Whether, in spite of all this, a political mistake was not made in not
accepting French aid when it was first offered (in the spring of 1848)
must remain an open question. When the French came eleven years later,
they were actuated by no purer motives, but who would say that Cavour,
instead of seeking, should have refused the French alliance?</p>

<p>One other point has still to be noticed: the proposal made by Austria
in the month of May to give up Lombardy unconditionally if she might keep
Venetia, which was promised a separate administration and a national army.
Nothing shows the state of mind then prevailing in a more distinct light
than the scorn with which this offer was everywhere treated. Lord
Palmerston declined to mediate on such a basis 'because there was no
chance of the proposal being entertained,' which proved correct, as when
it was submitted to the Provisional Government of Milan, it was not even
thought worth taking into consideration. No one would contemplate the
sacrifice of Venice by a new Campo Formio.</p>

<p>Far, indeed, was Austria the victorious in August from Austria the
humiliated in May. On the 9th of August, Hess and Salasco signed the
armistice between the lately contending Powers. The next day the Emperor
Ferdinand returned to his capital, from which he had been chased in the
spring. He might well congratulate himself upon the marvellous recovery of
his empire; but the revolution in Hungary was yet to be quelled, and
another rising at Vienna in October tried his nerves, which were never of
the strongest. On the 2nd of December he <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg.119]</a></span> abdicated in favour of his
young nephew, the Archduke Francis Joseph, who had been brought face to
face more than once on the Mincio with the Duke of Savoy, whom he rivalled
in personal courage.</p>

<p>On the 10th of December, another event occurred which placed a new
piece on the European chess-board: Louis Napoleon was elected to the
Presidency of the French Republic.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4>THE DOWNFALL OF THRONES</h4>

<h5>1848-1849</h5>

<h5>Garibaldi Arrives&mdash;Venice under Manin&mdash;The Dissolution of
the Temporal Power&mdash;Republics at Rome and Florence.</h5>

<p><br />
 While the remnant of the Piedmontese army recrossed the bridge over the
Ticino at Pavia, crushed, though not though want of valour, outraged in
the person of its King, surely the saddest vanquished host that ever
retraced in sorrow the path it had traced in the wildest joy, a few
thousand volunteers in Lombardy still refused to lay down their arms or to
recognise that, after the capitulation of Milan, all was lost. Valueless
as a fact, their defiance of Austria had value as a prophecy, and its
prophetic aspect comes more clearly into view when it is seen that the
leader of the little band was Garibaldi, while its standard-bearer was
Mazzini. These two had lately met for the first time since 1833, when
Garibaldi, or 'Borel,' as he was called in the ranks of 'Young Italy,'
went to Marseilles to make the acquaintance of the head and brain of the
society which he had joined, as has been mentioned, on the banks of the
Black Sea.</p>

<p>'When I was young and had only aspirations,' said Garibaldi in London
in April 1864, 'I sought out a man who could give me counsel and guide my
youthful years; I sought him as the thirsty man seeks water. This man I
found; he alone kept alive the sacred fire, he alone watched <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg.121]</a></span> while all
the world slept; he has always remained my friend, full of love for his
country, full of devotion for the cause of freedom: this man is Joseph
Mazzini.'</p>

<p>The words spoken then&mdash;when the younger patriot was the chosen
hero of the greatest of free nations, while the elder, still misunderstood
by almost all, was shunned and calumniated, and even called 'the worst
enemy of Italy'&mdash;gave one fresh proof, had one been wanting, that,
though there have been more flawless characters than Garibaldi, never in a
human breast beat a more generous heart. Politically, there was nearly as
much divergence between Mazzini and Garibaldi as between Mazzini and
Cavour; the master thought the pupil lacked ideality, the pupil thought
the master lacked practicalness; but they were at one in the love of their
land and in the desire to serve her.</p>

<p>On parting with Mazzini in 1833, Garibaldi, then captain of a sailing
vessel, went to Genoa and enrolled himself as a common sailor in the Royal
Piedmontese Navy. The step, strange in appearance, was certainly taken on
Mazzini's advice, and the immediate purpose was doubtless to make converts
for 'Young Italy' among the marines. Had Garibaldi been caught when the
ruthless persecution of all connected with 'Young Italy' set in, he would
have been shot offhand, as were all those who were found dabbling with
politics in the army and navy. He escaped just in time, and sailed for
South America.</p>

<p>The <i>Gazzetta Piemontese</i> of the 17th of June 1834 published the
sentence of death passed upon him, with the rider which declared him
exposed to public vengeance 'as an enemy of the State, and liable to all
the penalties of a brigand of the first category.' He saw the paper; and
it was the first time that he or anyone else had seen the <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg.122]</a></span> name of
Giuseppe Garibaldi in print; a name of which Victor Emmanuel would one day
say that 'it filled the furthest ends of the earth.'</p>

<p>Profitable to Italy, over nearly every page of whose recent history
might be written 'out of evil cometh forth good,' was the banishment which
threw Garibaldi into his romantic career of the next twelve years between
the Amazon and the Plata. Soldier of fortune who did not seek to enrich
himself; soldier of freedom who never aimed at power, he always meant to
turn to account for his own country the experience gained in the art of
war in that distant land, where he rapidly became the centre of a legend,
almost the origin of a myth. Antique in simplicity, singleness,
superabundance of life, and in a sort of naturalism which is not of
to-day; unselfconscious, trustful in others, forgiving, incapable of fear,
abounding in compassion, Garibaldi's true place is not in the aggregation
of facts which we call history, but in the apotheosis of character which
we call the <i>Iliad</i>, the <i>Mahabharata</i>, the <i>Edda</i>, the
cycles of Arthur and of Roland, and the <i>Romancero del Cid</i>.</p>

<p>In childhood he rescued a drowning washerwoman; in youth he nursed men
dying of cholera; as a veteran soldier he passed the night among the rocks
of Caprera hunting for a lamb that was lost. No amount of habit could
remove the repugnance he felt at uttering the word 'fire.' Yet this gentle
warrior, when his career was closed and he lay chained to his bed of pain,
endorsed his memoirs with the Spanish motto: 'La guerra es la verdadera
vida del hombre.' War was the veritable life of Garibaldi; war, not
conspiracy; war, not politics; war, not, alas! model farming, for which
the old chief fancied in his later years that he had discovered in himself
a vocation.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">
[Pg.123]</a></span> Riding the wild horses and chasing the wild cattle of
the Pampas, his eyes covering the immense spaces untrodden by man, this
corsair of five-and-twenty drank deep of the innocent pleasures of untamed
nature, when not occupied in fighting by land or sea, with equal fortune;
or rather, perhaps, with greater fortune and greater proof of inborn
genius as commander of the naval campaign of the Paran[=a] than as
defender of Monte Video. No adventures were wanting to him; he was even
imprisoned and tortured. In South America he found the one woman worthy to
bear his name, the lion-hearted Anita, whom he carried off, she
consenting, from her father and the man to whom her father had betrothed
her. Garibaldi in after years expressed such deep contrition for the act
which bore Anita away from the quiet life in store for her, and plunged
her into hardships which only ended when she died, that, misinterpreting
his remorse, many supposed the man from whom he took her to have been
already her husband. It was not so. Shortly before the Church of San
Francisco at Monte Video was burnt down (some twenty years ago), the
marriage register of Garibaldi and Anita was found in its archives, and a
legal copy was made. In it she is described as 'Do&ntilde;a Ana Maria de
Jesus, unmarried daughter of Don Benito Rivevio de Silva, of Laguna, in
Brazil.' The bridegroom, who during all his American career had scarcely
clothes to cover him, parted with his only possession, an old silver
watch, to pay the priest's fees. Head of the Italian Legion, he only took
the rations of a common soldier, and as candles were not included in the
rations, he sat in the dark. Someone reported this to the Government, who
sent him a present of &pound;20, half of which he gave to a poor
widow.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">
[Pg.124]</a></span> When the first rumours that something was preparing in
Italy reached Monte Video, Garibaldi wrote a letter offering his services
to the Pope, still hailed as Champion of Freedom, and soon embarked
himself for the Old World, with eighty-five of his best soldiers, among
whom was his beloved friend, Francesco Anzani. Giacomo Medici had been
despatched a little in advance to confer with Mazzini. At starting, the
Legion knew nothing of the revolution in Milan and Venice, or of Charles
Albert having taken the field. Great was their wonder, therefore, on
reaching Gibraltar, to see hoisted on a Sardinian ship a perfectly new
flag, never beheld by them out of dreams&mdash;the Italian tricolor.</p>

<p>So Garibaldi returned at forty-one years of age to the country where
the sentence of death passed upon him had never been revoked. Before the
law he was still 'a brigand of the first category.' Nor was he quite sure
that he would not be arrested, and, as a precaution, when he cast anchor
in the harbour of his native Nice, he ran up the Monte Videan colours. It
was needless. Throngs of people crowded the quays to welcome home the
Ligurian captain, who had done great things over sea. Anita was there; she
had preceded him to Europe with their three children, Teresita, Menotti
and Ricciotti. There, also, was his old mother, who never ceased to be
beautiful, the 'Signora Rosa,' as the Nizzards called her. She was almost
a woman of the people, but the simple dignity of her life made all treat
her as a superior being. To her prayers, while she lived, Garibaldi
believed that he owed his safety in so many perils, and after her death
the soldiers used to say that on the eve of battles he walked apart
communing with her spirit.</p>

<p>From Nice, Garibaldi went to Genoa, where he took a last leave of his
friend Anzani, who returned from exile not to fight, as he had hoped,
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg.125]</a></span>
but to die. The day before he expired, Medici arrived at Genoa; he was
very angry with the Chief, in consequence of some disagreement as to the
place of landing. Anzani said to him entreatingly: 'Do not be hard,
Medici, on Garibaldi; he is a predestined man: a great part of the future
of Italy is in his hands.' The counsel from dying lips sank deep into
Medici's heart; he often disagreed with Garibaldi, but to his last day he
never quarrelled with him again. Long years after, if friction arose
between Garibaldi and his King, it was Medici's part to throw oil on the
waters.</p>

<p>Garibaldi sought an interview with Charles Albert, and offered him his
arms and the arms of his Legion, 'not unused to war.' Pope or prince,
little it mattered to him who the saviour of Italy should be. But Charles
Albert, though he was polite, merely referred his visitor to his
ministers, and the inestimable sword of the hero went begging for a month
or more, till the Provisional Government of Milan gave him the command of
the few thousand volunteers with whom we saw him at the conclusion of the
campaign. The war was over before he had a chance of striking a blow. His
indignant cry of defiance could not be long sustained, for Garibaldi never
drove men to certain and useless slaughter; when the real position of
things became known to him, he led his band over the Swiss confines, and
bid them wait for a better and not distant day.</p>

<p>Under Manin's wise rule, which was directed solely to the preservation
of peace within the city, and resistance to the enemy at its gates, Venice
remained undaunted by the catastrophes in Lombardy, after all the Venetian
<i>terra firma</i> had been restored to Austria. (Even the heroic little
mountain fort of Osopo in the Friuli was compelled to capitulate on the
12th of October.) The blockade of the city on the <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg.126]</a></span> lagunes did not prevent
Venice from acting not only on the defensive but on the offensive; in the
sortie of the 27th of October, 2500 Venetians drove the Austrians from
Mestre with severe losses, carrying back six captured guns, which the
people dragged in triumph to the Doge's palace. A cabin-boy named Zorzi
was borne on the shoulders of the soldiers enveloped in the Italian flag;
his story was this: the national colours, floating from the mast of the
pinnace on which he served, were detached by a ball and dropped into the
water; the child sprang in after them, and with a shout of <i>Viva
l'Italia,</i> fixed them again at the masthead under a sharp fire. Zorzi
was, of course, the small hero of the hour, especially among the women.
General Pepe commanded the sortie, with Ulloa, Fontana and Cosenz as his
lieutenants; Ugo Bassi, the patriot monk of Bologna, marched at the head
of a battalion with the crucifix, the only arms he ever carried, in his
hand. The success cost Italy dear, as Alessandro Poerio, poet and patriot,
the brother of Baron Carlo Poerio of Naples, lost his life by a wound
received at Mestre. But the confidence of Venice in her little army was
increased a hundredfold.</p>

<p>The most important event of the autumn of 1848 was the gradual but
continuous break-up of the Papal authority in Rome. The meeting of the new
Parliament only served to accentuate the want of harmony between the Pope
and his ministers; assassinations were frequent; what law there was was
administered by the political clubs. In Count Terenzio Mamiani, Pius IX.
found a Prime Minister who, for eloquence and patriotism, could hardly be
rivalled, but hampered as he was by the opposition he encountered from the
Sovereign, and by the absence of any real or solid moderate constitutional
party in the Chamber of <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_127" id=
"Page_127">[Pg.127]</a></span> Deputies, Mamiani could carry out very few
of the improvements he desired to effect, and in August he retired from an
impracticable task, to be replaced by men of less note and talent than
himself.</p>

<p>Wishing to create fresh complications for the Pope, the Austrians
invaded the Legations, regardless of his protests, and after the fall of
Milan, General Welden advanced on Bologna, where, however, his forces were
so furiously attacked by the inhabitants and the few carabineers who were
all the troops in the town, that they were dislodged from the strong
position they had taken up on the Montagnola, the hill which forms the
public park, and obliged to fly beyond the city walls. Radetsky
disapproved of Welden's movements on Bologna, and ordered him not to
return to the assault.</p>

<p>Had the Austrians returned and massacred half the population of
Bologna, the Pope might have been saved. When Rome heard that the stormy
capital of Romagna was up in arms, once more, for a moment, there were
united counsels. 'His Holiness,' ran the official proclamation, 'was
firmly resolved to repel the Austrian invasion with all the means which
his State and the well-regulated enthusiasm of his people could supply.'
The Chamber confirmed the ministerial proposal to demand French help
against Austria. But all this brave show of energy vanished with the
pressing danger, and Bologna, which, by its manly courage, had galvanised
the whole bloodless body-politic, now hastened the hour of dissolution by
lapsing into a state of deplorable anarchy, the populace using the arms
with which they had driven out the Austrians, to establish a reign of
murder and pillage. L.C. Farini restored something like order, but the
general weakness of the power of government became every day more
apparent.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">
[Pg.128]</a></span> The Pope made a last endeavour to avert the
catastrophe by calling to his counsels Count Pellegrino Rossi, a man of
unyielding will, who was as much opposed to demagogic as to theocratic
government. Rossi, having been compromised when very young in Murat's
enterprises, lived long abroad, and attained the highest offices under
Louis Philippe, who sent him to Rome to arrange with the Pope the delicate
question of the expulsion of the Jesuits from France, which he conducted
to an amicable settlement, though one not pleasing to the great Society.
Not being one of those who change masters as they change their boots
according to the state of the roads, the ambassador retired from the
French service when Louis Philippe was dethroned. As minister to the Pope,
he made his influence instantly felt; measures were taken to restore order
in the finances, discipline in the army, public security in the streets,
and method and activity in the Government offices. The tax on
ecclesiastical property was enforced; fomenters of anarchy, even though
they wore the garb of patriots, and perhaps honestly believed themselves
to be such, were vigorously dealt with. If anyone could have given the
Temporal Power a new lease of life, it would have been a man so gifted and
so devoted as Pellegrino Rossi, but the entire forces, both of subversion
and of reaction, were against him, and most of all was against him the
fatality of dates. Not at human bidding do the dead arise and walk. The
most deeply to be regretted event that happened in the course of the
Italian revolution gave his inevitable failure the appearance of a
fortuitous accident.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">
[Pg.129]</a></span> Parliament, which had been prorogued on the 26th of
August, was to open on the 15th of November. Anarchy, black and red, was
in the air. Though disorders were expected, Rossi made no provision for
keeping the space clear round the palace where Parliament met; knots of
men, with sinister faces, gathered in all parts of the square. Rossi was
warned in the morning that an attempt would be made to assassinate him; he
was entreated not to go to the Chamber, to which he replied that it was
his duty to be present, and that if people wanted his blood they would
have it sooner or later, whether he took precautions or not. Two policemen
to keep the passage free when he reached the Chamber would, nevertheless,
have saved his life. As he walked from his carriage to the stairs, an
unknown individual pushed against him on the right side, and when he
turned to see who it was, the assassin plunged a dagger in his throat. He
fell, bathed in blood, to expire without uttering a word.</p>

<p>In the Chamber, the deputies proceeded to business; not one raised an
indignant protest against a crime which violated the independence of the
representatives of the nation. The mere understanding of what liberty
means is absolutely wanting in most populations when they first emerge
from servitude.</p>

<p>After the craven conduct of the deputies, it is no wonder if the dregs
of the people went further, and paraded the streets singing songs in
praise of the assassin. The Pope summoned the Presidents of the two
Chambers and Marco Minghetti, whom he requested to form a new ministry.
But the time for regular proceeding was past; the city was in the hands of
the mob, which imposed on the Pope the acceptance of a ministry of
nonentities nominated by it. The Swiss Guard fired on the crowd which
attempted to gain access to the Quirinal; the crowd, reinforced by the
Civic Guard, returned to the attack and fired <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg.130]</a></span> against the walls, a
stray shot killing Monsignor Palma, who was in one of the rooms. The Pope
decided on flight. He left Rome in disguise during the evening of the 25th
of November. After gaining the Neapolitan frontier, he took the road to
Gaeta. The illusion of the Pope Liberator ended with the Encyclical; the
illusion of the Constitutional Pope ended with the flight to Gaeta. Pius
IX. was only in a limited degree responsible for his want of success,
because the task he had set before him was the quadrature of the circle in
politics.</p>

<p>The weight of a less qualified responsibility rests upon him for his
subsequent actions. On the 3rd of December Parliament voted a proposal to
send a deputation to the Pope, praying him to return to his States. To
give the deputation greater authority, the Municipality of Rome proposed
that the Syndic, the octogenarian Prince Corsini, should accompany it. It
also comprised two ecclesiastics, and thus constituted, it left Rome for
Gaeta on the 5th of December. On the borders of the Neapolitan kingdom its
passage was barred by the police, and it was obliged to retrace its steps
to Terracina. Here the deputation drew up a letter to Cardinal Antonelli
(no longer the patriotic minister of the spring), in which an audience
with the Sovereign Pontiff was respectfully requested. The answer came
that the Pope would not receive the deputation. It was an answer that he
was at liberty to make, but it should have meant abdication. If, called
back by the will of the Parliament of his own making, the Sovereign
deigned not even to receive the bearers of the invitation, in what way did
he contemplate resuming the throne? It was only too easy to guess. The
Head of Christendom had become a convert of King Ferdinand of Naples,
otherwise Bomba. By a path strewn with the sinister flowers of war did
Pius IX. meditate returning to his subjects&mdash;by that path and no
other.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">
[Pg.131]</a></span> The Galetti-Sterbini ministry, appointed by the Pope
under popular pressure a few days before his departure, remained in charge
of affairs, somewhat strengthened by the adhesion of Terenzio Mamiani as
Minister of Foreign Affairs. Mamiani at first declined to form part of the
ministry, but joined it afterwards with self-sacrificing patriotism, in
the hope of saving things from going to complete rack and ruin during the
interregnum caused by the withdrawal of the Head of the State. He only
retired from the ungrateful office when he saw the imminence of a radical
change in the form of government, which was not desired by him any more
than it had been by Rossi.</p>

<p>The mass of the population of the Roman States had desired such a
change ever since the days of Gregory; the temporary enthusiasm for Pius,
if it arrested the flow of the stream, did not prevent the waters from
accumulating beyond the dyke. One day the dyke would burst, and the waters
sweep all before them.</p>

<p>A Constituent Assembly was convoked for the 5th of February 1849. The
elections, which took place on the 21st of January, were on this basis:
every citizen of more than twenty-one years was allowed to vote; every
citizen over twenty-five could become a deputy; the number of deputies was
fixed at two hundred; a candidate who received less than 500 votes would
not be elected. On the 9th of February, the Constituent Assembly voted the
downfall of the Temporal Power (free exercise of his spiritual functions
being, at the same time, assured to the Supreme Pontiff), and the
establishment of a republican form of government. The Roman Republic was
proclaimed from the Capitol.</p>

<p>Ten votes were given against the republic. No government ever came
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg.132]</a></span>
into existence in a more strictly legal manner. Had it not represented the
true will of the people, the last Roman Commonwealth could not have left
behind so glorious, albeit brief, a record.</p>

<p>A youthful poet, descendant of the Doges of Genoa, Goffredo Mameli,
whose 'Fratelli d'Italia' was the battle-hymn to which Italy marched,
wrote these three words to Mazzini: 'Roma, Repubblica, Venite.' So Mazzini
came to Rome, which confided her destinies to him, as she had once
confided them to the Brescian Arnold and to Cola di Rienzi. Not
Arnold&mdash;not Rienzi in his nobler days&mdash;dreamed a more sublime
dream of Roman liberty than did Giuseppe Mazzini, or more nearly wrote
down that dream in facts.</p>

<p>Originally the executive power was delegated to a committee, but this
was changed to a Triumvirate, the Triumvirs being Armellini, Saffi and
Mazzini. Mazzini's mind and will directed the whole.</p>

<p>On the 18th of February, Cardinal Antonelli demanded in the Pope's name
the armed intervention of France, Austria, Spain and Naples, 'as in this
way alone can order be restored in the States of the Church, and the Holy
Father re-established in the exercise of his supreme authority, in
compliance with the imperious exigencies of his august and sacred
character, the interests of the universal Church, and the peace of
nations. In this way he will be enabled to retain the patrimony which he
received at his accession, and transmit it in its integrity to his
successors.'</p>

<p>The Pope, who could not bring himself to stain his white robes with the
blood of the enemies of Italy, called in four armies to shoot down his
subjects, because in no other way could he recover his lost throne.</p>

<p>Pius IX. was the twenty-sixth Pontiff who called the foreigner into
Italy.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">
[Pg.133]</a></span> The final conquest of the Pope by the party of
universal reaction could only be effected by his isolation from all but
one set of influences; this is precisely what happened at Gaeta. There are
reasons for thinking that his choice of the hospitality of the King of the
Two Sicilies, rather than that of France or Spain or Sardinia, was the
result of an intrigue in which Count Spaur, the Bavarian minister who
represented the interests of Austria in Rome after that power withdrew her
ambassador, played a principal part. Even after Pius arrived at Gaeta, it
is said that he talked of it as the first stage of a longer journey. He
had never shown any liking for the Neapolitan Bourbons, and the
willingness which he expressed to Gioberti to crown Charles Albert King of
Italy if his arms were successful, was probably duly appreciated by
Ferdinand II. To save the Pope from absorption by the retrograde party,
and to avoid the certainty of a foreign invasion, Gioberti, who became
Prime Minister of Piedmont in November 1848, was anxious to occupy the
Roman states with Sardinian troops immediately after the Pope's flight,
when his subjects still recognised his sovereignty. Gioberti resigned
because this policy was opposed by Rattazzi and other of his colleagues in
the ministry. It would have been a difficult <i>r&ocirc;le</i> to play;
Sardinia, while endeavouring to checkmate the reaction, might have become
its instrument. The failure of Gioberti's plan cannot be regretted, but
his forecast of what would happen if it were not attempted proved to be
correct.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of his exalted guest, King Ferdinand with his
family, a great number of priests, and a strong escort, moved his
residence from the capital to Gaeta. The modified Constitution,
substituted for the first charter after the events of the 15th of May, was
still nominally in force; Parliament had met during the summer, <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg.134]</a></span> but
the King solved the riddle of governing through his ministers, on purely
retrograde principles, without paying more heed to the representatives of
the nations than to the benches on which they sat. Prorogued on the 5th of
September, Parliament was to have met on the 30th of November, but when
that date approached, it was prorogued again to the 1st of February. 'Our
misery has reached such a climax,' wrote Baron Carlo Poerio, 'that it is
enough to drive us mad. Every faculty of the soul revolts against the
ferocious reactionary movement, the more disgraceful from its execrable
hypocrisy. We are governed by an oligarchy; the only article maintained is
that respecting the taxes. The laws have ceased to exist; the Statute is
buried; a licentious soldiery rules over everything, and the press is
constantly employed to asperse honest men. The lives of the deputies are
menaced. Another night of St Bartholomew is threatened to all who will not
sell body and soul.' Ferdinand only waited till he had recovered
substantial hold over Sicily to do away with even the fiction of
parliamentary government. Messina had fallen in September, though not till
half the city was in flames, the barbarous cruelties practised on the
inhabitants after the surrender exciting the indignation of the English
and French admirals who witnessed the bombardment. This was the first step
to the subjection of Sicily, but not till after Syracuse and Catania fell
did the King feel that there was no further cause for anxiety&mdash;the
taking of the capital becoming a mere question of time. He was so much
pleased at the fall of Catania that he had a mock representation of the
siege performed at Gaeta in presence of the Pope and of half the sacred
college.</p>

<p>On the 13th of March Prince Torelli handed the President of the <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg.135]</a></span>
Neapolitan Chamber of Deputies a sealed packet which contained a royal
decree dissolving Parliament. Naples was once more under an irresponsible
despotism. The lazzaroni of both the lower and higher classes, if by
lazzaroni may be understood the born allies of ignorance, idleness and
bigotry, rejoiced and were glad. Nor were they few. Unlike the Austrians
in the north, Ferdinand had his party; the 'fidelity of his subjects' of
which he boasted, was not purely mythical. Whether, considering its basis,
it was much to boast of, need not be discussed.</p>

<p>In March, the happy family at Gaeta was increased by a new arrival. Had
he been better advised, Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, would have never
gone to breathe that malarious atmosphere. He had played no conjuror's
tricks with his promises to his people; Austrian though he was, he had
really acted the part of an Italian prince, and there was nothing to show
that he had not acted it sincerely. But a persistent bad luck attended his
efforts. Though the ministers appointed by him included men as
distinguished as the Marquis Gino Capponi, Baron Ricasoli and Prince
Corsini, they failed in winning a strong popular support. Leghorn, where
the population, unlike that of the rest of Tuscany, is by nature
turbulent, broke into open revolution. In the last crisis, the Grand Duke
entrusted the government to the extreme Liberals, Montanelli the
professor, and Guerrazzi the novelist; both were honourable men, and
Guerrazzi was thought by many to be a man of genius. The vigorous rhetoric
of his <i>Assedio di Firenze</i> had warmed the patriotism of many young
hearts. But, as statesmen, the only talent they showed was for upsetting
any <i>r&eacute;gime</i> with which they were connected.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">
[Pg.136]</a></span> The Grand Duke was asked to convoke a Constituent
Assembly, following the example of Rome. If every part of Italy were to do
the same, the constitution and form of government of the whole country
could be settled by a convention of the various assemblies. The idea was
worthy of respect because it pointed to unity; but in view of the existing
situation, Tuscany's solitary adhesion would hardly have helped the
nation, while it was accompanied by serious risks to the state. The Grand
Duke seemed about to yield to the proposal, but, on receiving a strong
protest from the Pope, he refused to do so on the ground that it would
expose himself and his subjects to the terrors of ecclesiastical censure.
He still remained in Tuscany, near Viareggio, till he was informed that a
band of Leghornese had set out with the intention of capturing his person.
Then he left for Gaeta on board the English ship <i>Bull Dog.</i> The
republic had been already proclaimed at Florence, with Montanelli and
Guerrazzi as its chief administrators. It succeeded in pleasing no one.
Civil war was more than once at the threshhold of Florence, for the
peasants rose in armed resistance to the new government. In less than two
months the restoration of the Grand. Ducal authority was accomplished
almost of itself. Unfortunately, the Grand Duke who was to come back was
not the same man as he who went away. The air of Gaeta did its work.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h4>AT BAY</h4>

<h5>1849</h5>

<h5>Novara&mdash;Abdication of Charles Albert&mdash;Brescia
crushed&mdash;French Intervention&mdash;The Fall of Rome&mdash;The Fall of
Venice.</h5>

<p><br />
 In the spring of 1848, a date might be found when every Italian ruler
except the Duke of Modena wore the appearance of a friend to freedom and
independence. In the spring of 1849 no Italian prince preserved that
appearance except the King of Sardinia. Many causes contributed to the
elimination, but most of all the logic of events. It was a case of the
survival of the fittest. What seemed a calamity was a step in advance.</p>

<p>Early in March, the Marquis Pallavicini, prisoner of Spielberg, had a
long interview with Charles Albert. They sat face to face talking over
Italian matters, and the King said confidently that the army was now
flourishing; if the die were cast anew, they would win. At parting he
embraced the Lombard patriot with the words: 'Dear Pallavicini, how glad I
am to have seen you again! You and I had always the same thought; the
independence of Italy was the first dream of my youth; it is my dream
still, it will be till I die.'</p>

<p>Some characters grow small in misfortune, others grow great. The
terrible scene at the Palazzo Greppi, the charge of treason, the <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg.138]</a></span>
shouts of 'death,' had left only one trace on Charles Albert's mind: the
burning desire to deliver his accusers.</p>

<p>The armistice was denounced on the 12th of March, a truce of eight days
being allowed before the recommencement of hostilities. There is such a
thing in politics as necessary madness, and it may be doubted if the
Sardinian war of 1849 was not this thing. The programme of <i>fare da
s&egrave;</i> had now to be carried out in stern earnest. Sardinia stood
alone, neither from south of the Apennines nor from north of the Alps
could help be hoped for. France, which was meditating quite another sort
of intervention, refused the loan even of a general. 'They were not going
to offend Austria to please Piedmont,' said the French Cabinet. Worse than
this, the army was not in the flourishing state of which the King had
spoken. The miseries of the retreat, but infinitely more, the incidents of
Milan, though wiped out by the King from his own memory, were vividly
recollected by all ranks. Affection was not the feeling with which the
Piedmontese soldiers regarded the 'fratelli Lombardi.' Did anyone beside
the King believe that this army, which had lost faith in its cause, in its
leaders and in itself, was going to beat Radetsky? The old Field-Marshal
might well show the wildest joy when the denunciation of the armistice was
communicated to him. And yet the higher expediency demanded that the
sacrifice of Piedmont and of her King for Italy should be consummated.</p>

<p>Rattazzi announced the coming campaign to the Chambers on the 14th of
March; the news was well received; there was a general feeling that,
whatever happened, the present situation could not be prolonged. With
regard to the numbers they could put in the field, Austria and <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg.139]</a></span>
Sardinia were evenly balanced, each having about 80,000 disposable men.
The request for a French marshal having been refused, the chief command
was given to Chrzanowski, a Pole, who did not know Italian, had not
studied the theatre of the war, and was so little favoured by nature that,
to the impressionable Italians, his appearance seemed ludicrous. This
deplorable appointment was made to satisfy the outcry against Piedmontese
generalship; as if it was not enough, the other Polish general, Ramorino,
accused of treachery by the revolutionists in 1832, but now praised to the
skies by the democratic party, was placed in command of the fifth or
Lombard division.</p>

<p>Though Radetsky openly gave the word 'To Turin!' Chrzanowski seems to
have failed to realise that the Austrians intended to invade Piedmont. He
ordered Ramorino, however, with his 8000 Lombards, to occupy the fork
formed by the Po and the Ticino, so as to defend the bridge at Pavia, if,
by chance, any fraction of the enemy tried to cross it. What Ramorino did
was to place his division on the right bank of the Po, and to destroy the
bridge of boats at Mezzana Corte <i>between</i> himself and the enemy. The
Austrians crossed the Ticino in the night of the 20th of April, not with a
fraction, but with a complete army. Ramorino was deprived of his command,
and was afterwards tried by court-martial and shot. Whether his treason
was intentional or involuntary, it is certain that, had he stemmed the
Austrian advance even for half a day, the future disasters, if not
averted, would not have come so rapidly, because the Piedmontese would
have been forewarned. On the evening of the 21st, General D'Aspre, with
15,000 men, took a portion of the Sardinian army unawares near Mortara,
and, owing to the scattered distribution of the Piedmontese, who would
have <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">
[Pg.140]</a></span> outnumbered him had they been concentrated, he
succeeded in forcing his way into Mortara by nightfall. The moral effect
of this first reverse was bad, but Chrzanowski rashly decided staking the
whole fate of the campaign in a field-day, for which purpose he gathered
what troops he could collect at La Biccocca, a hill capped with a village
about a mile and a half from Novara. Not more than 50,000 men were
collected; some had already deserted, and 20,000 were doing nothing on the
other side of the Po.</p>

<p>Towards eleven o'clock D'Aspre arrived, and lost no time in beginning
the attack. He sent post-haste to Radetsky, Appel and Thurn to bring all
the reinforcements in their power as fast as possible. D'Aspre's daring
was rewarded by his carrying La Biccocca at about mid-day, but the Duke of
Genoa retook the position with the aid of the valorous 'Piemonte' brigade,
and by two p.m. D'Aspre's brave soldiers were so thoroughly beaten, that
nothing could have saved his division from destruction, as he afterwards
admitted, had Chrzanowski joined in the pursuit instead of staying behind
with more than half the army, in accordance with a preconceived plan of
remaining on the defensive.</p>

<p>At two o'clock on the 23rd of March, the news started on the wings of
the wind, and, as great news will do, swiftly reached every part of the
waiting country, that the Sardinians were getting the best of it, that the
cause was saved. Men who are not very old remember this as the first
strong sensation of their lives&mdash;this, and its sequel.</p>

<p>Appel and Thurn, and Wratislaw and the old Field-Marshal were on the
march, and by four o'clock they were pouring their fresh troops upon the
Piedmontese, who had not known how to profit by their success. <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg.141]</a></span>
Heroism such as few battlefields have seen, disorder such as has rarely
disgraced a beaten army, were displayed side by side in Charles Albert's
ranks. At eight in the evening, the whole Sardinian army retired into
Novara; the Austrians bivouacked on La Biccocca. The Sardinians had lost
4000 in dead and wounded; the losses of the victors were a thousand
less.</p>

<p>All the day long the King courted death, pressing forward where the
balls fell like hail and the confusion was at its height, with the answer
of despair to the devoted officers who sought to hold him back: 'Let me
die, this is my last day.' But death shuns the seeker. Men fell close
beside him, but no charitable ball struck his breast. In the evening he
said to his generals: 'We have still 40,000 men, cannot we fall back on
Alessandria and still make an honourable stand?' They told him that it
could not be done. Radetsky was asked on what terms he would grant an
armistice; he replied: 'The occupation of a large district in Piedmont,
and the heir to the throne as a hostage.' Then Charles Albert knew what he
must do. 'For eighteen years,' he said, 'I have made every effort for the
good of the people; I grieve to see that my hopes have failed, not so much
for myself as for the country. I have not found death on the field of
battle as I ardently desired; perhaps my person is the only obstacle to
obtaining juster terms. I abdicate the crown in favour of my son, Victor
Emmanuel.' And turning to the Duke of Savoy he said: 'There is your
King.'</p>

<p>In the night he left Novara alone for Nice. As he passed through the
Austrian lines, the sentinels were nearly firing upon his carriage;
General Thurn, before whom he was brought, asked for some proof that <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg.142]</a></span> he
was in fact the 'Count de Barge' in whose name his passport was made out.
A Bersagliere prisoner who recognised the King, at a sign from him gave
the required testimony, and he was allowed to pass. At Nice he was
received by the governor, a son of Santorre di Santa Rosa, and to him he
addressed the last words spoken by him on Italian ground: 'In whatever
time, in whatever place, a regular government raises the flag of war with
Austria, the Austrians will find me among their enemies as a simple
soldier.' Then he continued his journey to Oporto.</p>

<p>The principal side-issue of the campaign of 1849 was the revolution at
Brescia. Had the original plan been carried out, which was to throw the
Sardinian army into Lombardy (and it is doubtful whether, even after
Radetsky's invasion of Piedmont, it would not have been better to adhere
to it), a corresponding movement on the part of the inhabitants would have
become of the greatest importance. To Brescia, which was the one Lombard
town where the Piedmontese had been received in 1848 with real effusion,
the Sardinian Minister of War despatched Count Giuseppe Martinengo
Cesaresco with arms and ammunition, and orders to reassume the colonelcy
of the National Guard which he held in the previous year, and to take the
general control of the movement as far as Brescia was concerned.
Martinengo succeeded in transporting the arms through the enemy's country
from the Piedmontese frontier to Iseo, and thence to his native city. When
he reached Brescia, he found that the Austrians had evacuated the town,
though they still occupied the castle which frowns down upon it. This was
the 23rd of March: Novara was fought and lost, Piedmont was powerless to
come to the <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">
[Pg.143]</a></span> assistance of the people she had commanded to rise.
What was to be done? Plainly common sense suggested an honourable
compromise with the Austrian commandant, by which he should be allowed to
reoccupy the city on condition that no hair of the citizens' heads was
touched. This is what Bergamo and the other towns did, nor are they to be
blamed.</p>

<p>Not so Brescia. Here, where love of liberty was an hereditary instinct
from the long connection of Brescia with free Venice, where hatred of the
stranger, planted by the ruthless soldiery of Gaston de Foix, had but gone
on maturing through three centuries, where the historical title of
'Valiant,' coming down from a remote antiquity, was still no fable; here,
with a single mind, the inhabitants resolved upon as desperate a
resistance as was ever offered by one little town to a great army.</p>

<p>The Austrian bombardment was begun by the Irish General, Nugent-Lavall,
who, dying in the midst of it, left all his fortune to the heroic city
which he was attacking. The Austrians, flushed with their victory over
Charles Albert's army of 80,000, were seized with rage at the sight of
their power defied by a town of less than half that number of souls. But
with that rage was mingled, even in the mind of Haynau, an admiration not
to be repressed.</p>

<p>Haynau who was sent to replace Nugent, was already known at Brescia,
where he had been appointed military governor after the resumption of
Austrian authority in 1848. In order to punish the 'persistent opposition
manifested to the legitimate Imperial and Royal Government,' and as an
example to the other towns, he had imposed on the Brescian householders
and the landed proprietors of the province a <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg.144]</a></span> fine of half a million
francs.</p>

<p>He now returned, and what he did may be best read in his own report on
the operations. 'It was then,' he wrote, 'that began the most murderous
fight; a fight prolonged by the insurgents from barricade to barricade,
from house to house, with extraordinary obstinacy. I should never have
believed that so bad a cause could have been sustained with such
perseverance. In spite of this desperate defence, and although the assault
could only be effected in part, and with the help of cannons of heavy
calibre, our brave troops with heroic courage, but at the cost of great
losses, occupied a first line of houses; but as all my columns could not
penetrate into the town at the same time, I ordered the suspension of the
attack at nightfall, limiting myself to holding the ground conquered. In
spite of that, the combat continued late into the night. On the 1st of
April, in the earliest morning light, the tocsin was heard ringing with
more fury than ever, and the insurgents reopened fire with an entirely new
desperation. Considering the gravity of our losses, as well as the
obstinacy and fury of the enemy, it was necessary to adopt a most rigorous
measure. I ordered that no prisoners should be taken, but that every
person seized with arms in his hand should be immediately put to death,
and that the houses from which shots came should be burnt. It is thus that
conflagrations, partly caused by the troops, partly by the bombardment,
broke out in various parts of the town.'</p>

<p>During the ten days' struggle, the citizens did not flinch for a
moment. Count Martinengo was the guiding spirit of the defence, and
scarcely left the most exposed of the barricades night or day. From the
nobles to the poorest of the people, all did their duty. A youth named
Tito Speri led and animated the populace. The horrors of the <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg.145]</a></span> repression
make one think of the fall of Khartoum. Not even in Hungary, where he went
from Brescia to continue his 'system,' did Haynau so blacken his own and
his country's name as here. In a boys' school kept by a certain Guidi, the
master's wife, his mother and ten of his pupils were slaughtered. A little
hunchback tailor was carried to the barracks to be slowly burnt alive. But
stray details do not give the faintest idea of the whole. And for all
this, Haynau was in a far higher degree responsible than the actual
executants of the vengeance to which he hounded on his ignorant soldiers,
maddened with the lust of blood.</p>

<p>Such was General Haynau, 'whose brave devotion to his master's service
was the veteran's sole crime,' said the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (June
1853), but who was judged otherwise by some in England. Wherefore was he
soundly beaten by the brewers in the employment of Messrs Barclay &amp;
Perkins; and the nice words of the <i>Quarterly</i> could not undo that
beating, redress for which Lord Palmerston blandly advised the complainant
to seek 'before the common tribunals.' He thought it best to neglect the
advice, and to leave the country.</p>

<p>Among the curious taxes levied at Brescia during the six months after
its fall was one of &pound;500 for 'the expenses of the hangman.' Count
Martinengo escaped after the Austrians were in possession of the town
through the courageous assistance given to him by a few young men of the
working class. Camozzi's band of Bergamasques, which started for the
relief of the sister city, was driven back with loss.</p>

<p>The end was come, but woe to the victors.</p>

<p>Following the Italian flag to where it still floated, we pass from
Brescia in the dust to Rome still inviolate, though soon to be assailed by
the bearers of another tricolor. A few days after Novara, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg.146]</a></span> the
Triumvirate issued a proclamation, in which they said: 'The Republic in
Rome has to prove to Italy and to Europe that our work is eminently
religious, a work of education and of morality; that the accusations of
intolerance, anarchy and violent upturning of things are false; that,
thanks to the republican principle, united as one family of good men under
the eye of God, and following the impulse of those who are first among us
in genius and virtue, we march to the attainment of true order, law and
power united.' Englishmen who were in Rome at the time attest how well the
pledge was kept. Peace and true freedom prevailed under the republican
banner as no man remembered them to have prevailed before in Rome. The
bitter provocation of the quadruple attack was not followed by revengeful
acts on the parts of the government against those who were politically and
religiously associated with him at whose bidding that attack was made.
Nothing like a national party was terrorised or kept under by fear of
violence. 'That at such a time,' writes Henry Lushington, who was not
favourable to Mazzini, 'not one lawless or evil deed was done would have
been rather a miracle than a merit, but on much concurrent testimony it is
clear that the efforts of the government to preserve order were incessant,
and to a remarkable degree successful.' He adds that the streets were far
safer for ordinary passengers under the Triumvirs than under the
Papacy.</p>

<p>Of great help in quieting the passions of the lower orders was the
people's tribune, Ciceruacchio, who had not put on black cloth clothes, or
asked for the ministry of war, or of fine arts, according to the usual
wont of successful tribunes. Ciceruacchio had the sense of humour of the
genuine Roman <i>popolano</i>, and it never came into his <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg.147]</a></span> head to
make himself ridiculous. His influence had been first acquired by works of
charity in the Tiber floods. Being a strong swimmer, he ventured where no
one else would go, and had saved many lives. At first a wine-carrier, he
made money by letting out conveyances and dealing in forage, but he gave
away most of what he made. He opposed the whole force of his popularity to
a war of classes. 'Viva chi c'ia e chi non c'ia quattrini!' <a name=
"FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> was his favourite
cry. Once when a young poet read him a sonnet in his honour he stopped him
at the line 'Thou art greater than all patricians,' saying that he would
not have that published: 'I respect the nobility, and never dream of being
higher than they. I am a poor man of the people, and such I will always
remain.'</p>

<p>When the siege came, Ciceruacchio was invaluable in providing the
troops with forage, horses, and even victuals, which he procured by making
private sorties on his own account during the night; his intimate
knowledge of every path enabling him to go unobserved. He planned the
earthworks, at which he laboured with his hands, and when fighting was
going on, he shouldered a musket and ran with his two sons, one of them a
mere child, to wherever the noise of guns directed him. No picture of Rome
in 1849 would be complete without the burly figure and jocund face of
Angelo Brunetti.</p>

<p>The republican government found Rome with a mere shadow of an army; the
efforts to create one had been too spasmodic to do anything but make
confusion worse confounded by changes and experiments soon abandoned.
Perseverance and intelligence now had a different result, and the little
army, called into existence by the republic, proved admirable in
discipline, various and fantastic as were its components.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">
[Pg.148]</a></span> Towards the end of April, Garibaldi, who had been
stationed at Rieti, was ordered to bring his legion to Rome. Those who
witnessed the arrival saw one of the strangest scenes ever beheld in the
Eternal City. The men wore pointed hats with black, waving plumes; thin
and gaunt, their faces dark as copper, with naked legs, long beards and
wild dark hair hanging down their backs, they looked like a company of
Salvator Rosa's brigands. Beautiful as a statue amidst his extraordinary
host rode the Chief, mounted on a white horse, which he sat like a
centaur. 'He was quite a show, everyone stopping to look at him,' adds the
sculptor Gibson, to whom these details are owed. 'Probably,' writes
another Englishman, 'a human face so like a lion, and still retaining the
humanity nearest the image of its Maker, was never seen.' Garibaldi wore
the historic red shirt, and a small cap ornamented with gold.</p>

<p>The origin of the red shirt might have remained in poetic uncertainty
had it not been mentioned a few years ago in a volume of reminiscences
published by an English naval officer. The men employed in the
Salad&eacute;ros or great slaughtering and salting establishments for
cattle in the Argentine provinces wore scarlet woollen shirts; owing to
the blockade of Buenos Ayres, a merchant at Monte Video had a quantity of
these on his hands, and as economy was a great object to the government,
they bought the lot cheap for their Italian legion, little thinking that
they were making the 'Camicia Rossa' immortal in song and story.</p>

<p>The coming to Rome of the 1200 legionaries aroused private fears in the
hearts of the more timid inhabitants, but Garibaldi knew how to keep his
wild followers in hand, and gallant was the service they rendered to Roman
liberty.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">
[Pg.149]</a></span> That liberty was now on the eve of its peril. The
preliminaries of the French intervention in Rome are tolerably well known;
here it suffices to say that every new contribution to a more precise
knowledge of the facts only serves to confirm the charge of dissimulation,
or, to use a plainer and far better adapted word, of dishonesty, brought
against the French government for their part in the matter. White, indeed,
do Austria, Spain and Naples appear&mdash;the avowed upholders of priestly
despotism&mdash;beside the ruler of republican France and his ministers,
whose plan it was not to fight the Roman republic: fighting was far from
their counsels, but to betray it. It is proved that the restoration of the
Temporal Power was the aim of the expedition from the first; it is equally
proved that the French sought to get inside Rome by distinct disclaimers
of any such intention. 'We do not go to Italy,' they said, 'to impose with
our arms a system of government, but to assure the rights of liberty, and
to preserve a legitimate interference in the affairs of the peninsula.'
They adopted a curious method of assuring the rights of liberty.</p>

<p>The Pope would not have anything to do with the affair. 'If you say
openly that you are going to give me back my Temporal Power, well and
good; if not, I prefer the aid of Austria.' So he replied to the
flattering tales whispered in his ear, while tales no less flattering were
being whispered in the ear of Mazzini. He declined to give the French any
guarantees as to his future mode of governing; it cannot be said,
therefore, that they were under the delusion that they were restoring a
constitutional sovereign.</p>

<p>Efforts have been made to cast the responsibility of the Roman
intervention entirely on Louis Napoleon. Even Mazzini favoured that view,
but it is impossible to separate the President of the Republic <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg.150]</a></span> from
the 325 deputies who voted the supplies for the expedition on the 2nd of
April. Does anyone pretend that they were hoodwinked any more than Ledru
Rollin was hoodwinked, or the minority, which, roused by his vigorous
speech, voted against the grant? Louis Napoleon was far less Papal in his
sentiments than were most of the assenting deputies; his own opinion was
more truly represented by the letter which, as a private citizen, he wrote
to the 'Constitutionnel' in December 1848 than by his subsequent course as
President. In this letter he declared that a military demonstration would
be perilous even to the interests which it was intended to safeguard. He
had but one fixed purpose: to please France, so as to get himself made
Emperor. France must be held answerable for the means taken to please
her.</p>

<p>General Oudinot landed at Civitavecchia on the 25th of April, his
friendly assurances having persuaded the local authorities to oppose no
resistance, an unfortunate error, but the last. The correct judgment
formed by the Roman Government of the designs of the invaders was
considerably assisted by a French officer, Colonel Leblanc, who was sent
to Rome by Oudinot to come to an agreement with Mazzini for the amicable
reception of the French, and who, losing his temper, revealed more than he
was meant to reveal. His last words, 'Les Italiens ne se battent pas,'
unquestionably expressed the belief of the whole French force, from the
general-in-chief to the youngest drummer. They were soon going to have a
chance of testing its accuracy.</p>

<p>The Roman Assembly passed a vote that 'force should be repelled by
force.' Well-warned, therefore, but with the proverbial <i>coeur
l&eacute;ger</i>, Oudinot advanced on Rome with 8000 men early on the 30th
of April. At <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">
[Pg.151]</a></span> eleven o'clock the two columns came in sight of St
Peter's, and soon after, the first which moved towards Porta Angelica was
attacked by Colonel Masi. Garibaldi attacked the second column a mile out
of Porta San Pancrazio. At the first moment the superior numbers of the
French told, and the Italians fell back on Villa Pamphilli, but Colonel
Galetti arrived with reinforcements, and before long Garibaldi drove the
French from the Pamphilli Gardens and had them in full retreat along the
Civitavecchia road. Oudinot was beaten, Rome was victorious. 'This does
not surprise us Romans; but it will astonish Paris!' ran a manifesto of
the hour; the words are a little childish, but men are apt to be childish
when they are deeply moved. And as to the astonishment of Paris, all the
words in the world would fail to paint its proportions. Paris was indeed
astonished.</p>

<p>Garibaldi had not the chief command of the Roman army, or he would have
done more; there was nothing to prevent the Italians from driving Oudinot
into the sea. The Triumvirate, when appealed to directly by Garibaldi,
refused their sanction, either fearing to leave the capital exposed to the
Neapolitans who were advancing, or (and this seems to have been the real
reason) still hoping that France would repudiate Oudinot and come to
terms. Garibaldi was right on this occasion, and Mazzini was wrong. When
you are at war, nothing is so ruinous as to be afraid of damaging the
enemy.</p>

<p>The French ministers, bombarded with reproaches by friends and foes,
and most uneasy lest their troops in Italy should be destroyed before they
could send reinforcements, did disown Oudinot's march on Rome, and
Ferdinand de Lesseps was despatched nominally 'to arrange matters in a
pacific sense,' but actually to gain time.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">
[Pg.152]</a></span> In a sitting in the French Assembly, a member of the
opposition said to the President of the Council: 'You are going to
reinstate the Pope!' 'No, no,' ejaculated Odilon Barrot. 'You are going to
do the same as Austria,' cried Lamorici&egrave;re. 'We should be culpable
if we did,' was the answer. Lesseps' instructions, very vague, for the
rest, were given to him in this spirit. That Lesseps acted in good faith
has been generally admitted, and was always believed by Mazzini. It was to
the interest of the French Government to choose a tool who did not see how
far he was a tool. But if Lesseps had no suspicions, if he had not strong
suspicions of the real object of his employers, then he was already at
this date a man singularly easy to deceive.</p>

<p>The French envoy was commissioned to treat, not with the Triumvirate,
but with the Roman Assembly: a piece of insolence which the former would
have done well to reply to by sending him about his business. Lesseps,
however, thought that he would gain by speaking in person to Mazzini, and
in order that the interview should remain a secret, he decided to go to
him alone in the dead of the night and unannounced. Having made the
needful inquiries, he proceeded to the palace of the Consulta, the doors
of which seem to have been left open all night; there were guards, but
they were asleep, and the French diplomatist traversed the long suite of
splendid apartments, opening one into the other without corridors. At last
he reached the simply-furnished room where, upon an iron bedstead, Mazzini
slept. Lesseps watched him sleeping, fascinated by the beauty of his
magnificent head as it lay in repose. He still looked very young, though
there was hardly a state in Europe where he was not proscribed. When
Lesseps had gazed his full, he called 'Mazzini, Mazzini!' The Triumvir
awoke, sat up and <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">
[Pg.153]</a></span> asked if he had come to assassinate him? Lesseps told
him his name, and a long conversation followed. One thing, at least, that
Lesseps said in this interview was strictly true, namely, that Mazzini
must not count on the French republican soldiers objecting to fire on
republicans: 'The French soldier would burn down the cottage of his mother
if ordered by his superiors to do so.' The discipline of a great army is
proof against politics.</p>

<p>Lesseps was himself in much fear of being assassinated. He believed
that his footsteps were dogged by three individuals, one of whom was an
ex-French convict. He complained to Mazzini, who said that he could do
nothing, which probably shows that he gave no credence to the story. Then
Lesseps had recourse to Ciceruacchio, 'a man of the people who had great
influence on the population, and who had organised the revolution.' The
tribune seems to have quieted his fears and guaranteed his safety.</p>

<p>The French envoy could not help being struck by the tender care taken
of his wounded fellow-countrymen by the Princess Belgiojoso and other
noble ladies who attended the hospitals. Of prisoners who were not wounded
there were none, as they had been sent back scot-free to their general a
few days after the 30th of April. He was struck also by the firm resolve
of all classes not to restore the Pope. Some liked the existing
government, some did not, but all prayed heaven to be henceforth delivered
from the rule of an infallible sovereign.</p>

<p>Whatever was the measure of confidence which Mazzini felt in Lesseps,
he was firm as iron on the main point&mdash;the non-admittance of the
'friendly' French troops into Rome. Lesseps dragged on the negotiations
till his government had finished the preparations for <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg.154]</a></span> sending to
Rome a force which should not be much less than twice in number the whole
military resources of the republic. Then they recalled him, and, in order
not to be bound by anything that he might have said, they set about the
rumour that he was mad. Indignant at such treatment, Lesseps left the
diplomatic service, and turned his attention to engineering. This was the
origin of the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>While all these things were going on, the Austrians moved from Ferrara
and Modena towards Bologna, the Spaniards landed at Fiumicino, and 16,000
Neapolitans, commanded by Ferdinand II., encamped near Albano. Garibaldi
was attacked on the 9th of May by the Neapolitan vanguard, which he
obliged to fall back. On the 18th, he completely defeated King Ferdinand's
army near Velletri, and the King ordered a general retreat into his own
dominions, which was accomplished in haste and confusion.</p>

<p>By the end of May, Oudinot's forces were increased to over 35,000 men.
The defenders of Rome, under the chief command of General Rosselli, were
about 20,000, of whom half were volunteers. Colonel Marnara's Lombard
Legion of Bersaglieri was, in smartness of appearance and perfect
discipline, equal to any regular troops; in its ranks were the sons of the
best and richest Lombard families, such as Dandolo, Morosini and many
others. Medici's legion was also composed of educated and well-to-do young
men. The Bolognese, under the Marquis Melara, had the impetuous daring of
their race, and Count Angelo Masina did wonders with his forty lancers.
Wherever Garibaldi was&mdash;it was always in the hottest
places&mdash;there were to be seen, at no great distance, the patriot
monk, Ugo Bassi, riding upon a fiery horse, and the young poet of Free
Italy, Goffredo Mameli, with his slight, boyish <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg.155]</a></span> figure, and his fair
hair floating in the breeze. Nor must we omit from the list of Garibaldi's
bodyguard Forbes, the Englishman, and Anghiar, the devoted negro, who
followed his master like a dog.</p>

<p>Oudinot formally disavowed all Lesseps' proceedings from first to last,
and announced, on the 1st of June, that he had orders to take Rome as soon
as possible. Out of regard, however, for the French residents, he would
not begin the attack 'till the morning of Monday the 4th.' Now, though no
one knew it but the French general, that Monday morning began with
Sunday's dawn, when the French attacked Melara's sleeping battalion at the
Roman outposts. It was easy for the French to drive back these 300 men,
and to occupy the Villa Corsini ('Villa,' in the Roman sense, means a
garden) and the position dominating Porta San Pancrazio; but Galetti came
up and retook them all, to lose them again by nine o'clock. Then
Garibaldi, who was ill, hurried to the scene from his sick-bed, and thrice
that day he retook and thrice he lost the contested positions&mdash;a
brief statement, which represents prodigies of valour, and the oblation of
as noble blood as ever watered the earth of Rome. Melara, Masina, Daverio,
Dandolo, Mameli: every schoolboy would know these names if they belonged
to ancient, not to modern, history. Bright careers, full of promise, cut
short; lives renounced, not only voluntarily, but with joy, and to what
end? Not for interest or fame&mdash;not even in the hope of winning; but
that, erect and crowned with the roses of martyrdom, Rome might send her
dying salutation to the world.</p>

<p>At sunset the French had established their possession of all the points
outside the Gate of San Pancrazio, except the Vascello, a villa which had
been seized from their very teeth by Medici, who held it against all
comers. Monte Mario was also in their hands.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">
[Pg.156]</a></span> Mazzini, whose judgment was obscured by his
attribution of the Italian policy of France to Louis Napoleon alone, hoped
for a revolution in Paris, but Ledru Rollin's attempt at agitation
completely failed, and the country applauded its government now that the
mask was thrown away. The reasons for revolutions in Paris have always
been the same; they have to do with something else than the garrotting of
sister-republics.</p>

<p>Oudinot tightened his cordon; on the 12th of June he invited the city
to capitulate. The answer was a refusal; so, with the aid of his excellent
artillery, he crept on, his passage contested at each step, but not
arrested, till, on the 27th, the Villa Savorelli, Garibaldi's
headquarters, fell into the hands of the enemy, and, on the night of the
29th, the French were within the city walls. St Peter's day is the great
feast of Rome, and this time, as usual, the cupola of St Peter's was
illuminated, the Italian flag flying from the highest point. The
thunderstorm, which proverbially accompanies the feast, raged during the
night; the French shells flew in all directions; the fight raged fiercer
than the storm; Medici held out among the crumbling walls of the Vascello,
which had been bombarded for a week; the heroic Manara fell fighting at
Villa Spada; Garibaldi, descending into the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>,
dealt blows right and left: he seemed possessed by some supernatural
power. Those around him say that it is impossible that he would have much
longer escaped death, but suddenly a message came summoning him to the
Assembly&mdash;it saved his life. When he appeared at the door of the
Chamber, the deputies rose and burst into wild applause. He seemed
puzzled, but, looking down upon himself, he read the explanation; he was
covered with blood, his clothes were honeycombed by balls and <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg.157]</a></span> bayonet
thrusts, his sabre was so bent with striking that it would not go more
than half into its sheath.</p>

<p>What the Assembly wanted to know was whether the defence could be
prolonged; Garibaldi had only to say that it could not. They voted,
therefore, the following decree: 'In the name of God and of the People:
the Roman Constituent Assembly discontinues a defence which has become
impossible, and remains at its post.' At its post it remained till the
French soldiers invaded the Capitol, where it sat, when, yielding to brute
force, the deputies dispersed.</p>

<p>Mazzini, who would have resisted still, when all resistance was
impossible, wandered openly about the city like a man in a dream. He felt
as though he were looking on at the funeral of his best-beloved. How it
was that he was not killed or arrested is a mystery. At the end of a week
his friends induced him to leave Rome with an English passport.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of July, before the French made their official entry,
Garibaldi called his soldiers together in the square of the Vatican, and
told them that he was going to seek some field where the foreigner could
still be fought. Who would might follow him; 'I cannot offer you honours
or pay; I offer you hunger, thirst, forced marches, battles, death.'</p>

<p>Three thousand followed him. Beside her husband rode Anita; not even
for the sake of the child soon to come would she stay behind in safety.
Ugo Bassi was there; Anghiar was dead, Mameli was dying in a hospital, but
there was 'the partisan or brigand Forbes,' as he was described in a
letter of the Austrian general D'Aspre to the French general Oudinot, with
a good handful of Garibaldi's best surviving officers. Ciceruacchio came
with his two sons, and offered himself as <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg.158]</a></span> guide. No one knew what the
plan was, or if there was one. Like knights of old in search of
adventures, they set out in search of their country's foes. It was the
last desperate venture of men who did not know how to yield.</p>

<p>After wandering hither and thither, and suffering severe hardships, the
column reached the republic of San Marino. The brave hospitality of that
Rock of freedom prevented Garibaldi from falling into the clutches of the
Austrians, who surrounded the republic. He treated with the Regent for the
immunity of his followers, who had laid down their arms; and, in the
night, he himself escaped with Anita, Ugo Bassi, Forbes, Ciceruacchio and
a few others. They hoped to take their swords to Venice, but a storm
arose, and the boats on which they embarked were driven out of their
course. Some of them were stranded on the shore which bounds the
pine-forest of Ravenna, and here, hope being indeed gone, the Chief
separated from his companions. Of these, Ugo Bassi, and an officer named
Livraghi, were soon captured by the Austrians, who conveyed them to
Bologna, where they were shot. Ciceruacchio and his sons were taken in
another place, and shot as soon as taken. The boat which contained Colonel
Forbes was caught at sea by an Austrian cruiser: he was kept in Austrian
prisons for two months, and was constantly reminded that he would be
either shot or hung; but the English Government succeeded in getting him
liberated, and he lived to take part in more fortunate fights under
Garibaldi's standard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Anita was dying in a peasant's cottage, to which Garibaldi
carried her when the strong will and dauntless heart could no longer stand
in place of the strength that was finished. This was the 4th of August.
Scarcely had she breathed her last breath when Garibaldi, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg.159]</a></span> broken down
with grief as he was, had to fly from the spot. The Austrians were hunting
for him in all directions. All the Roman fugitives were proclaimed
outlaws, and the population was forbidden to give them even bread or
water. Nevertheless&mdash;aided in secret by peasants, priests and all
whose help he was obliged to seek&mdash;Garibaldi made good his flight
from the Adriatic to the Mediterranean, the whole route being overrun by
Austrians. When once the western coast was reached, he was able, partly by
sea and partly by land, to reach the Piedmontese territory, where his life
was safe. Not even there, however, could he rest; he was told, politely
but firmly, that his presence was embarrassing, and for the second time he
left Europe&mdash;first for Tunis and then for the United States.</p>

<p>While the French besieged Rome, the Austrians had not been idle. They
took Bologna in May, after eight days' resistance; and in June, after
twenty days' attack by sea and land, Ancona fell into their hands. In
these towns they pursued means of 'pacification' resembling those employed
at Brescia. All who possessed what by a fiction could be called arms were
summarily slaughtered. At Ancona, a woman of bad character hid a rusty
nail in the bed of her husband, whom she wished to get rid of; she then
denounced him to the military tribunal, and two hours later an English
family, whose house was near the barracks, heard the ring of the volley of
musketry which despatched him. Austria had also occupied the Grand Duchy
of Tuscany; and when, in July, Leopold II. returned to his state, which
had restored him by general consent and without any foreign intervention,
he entered Florence between two files of Austrian soldiery, in violation
of the article of the Statute to which he had sworn, which stipulated that
no foreign <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">
[Pg.160]</a></span> occupation should be invited or tolerated. The Grand
Duke wrote to the Emperor of Austria, from Gaeta, humbly begging the loan
of his arms. Francis Joseph replied with supreme contempt, that it would
have been a better thing if Leopold had never forgotten to whose family he
belonged, but he granted the prayer. Such was the way in which the House
of Hapsburg-Lorraine, that had done much in Tuscany to win respect if not
love, destroyed all its rights to the goodwill of the Tuscan people, and
removed what might have been a serious obstacle to Italian unity.</p>

<p>Austria, unable alone to cope with Hungary, committed the immeasurable
blunder of calling in the 200,000 Russians who made conquest certain, but
the price of whose aid she may still have to pay. Venice, and Venice only,
continued to defy her power. Since Novara, the first result of which was
the withdrawal of the Sardinian Commissioners, who had taken over the
government after the Fusion, Venice had been ruled by Manin on the terms
which he himself proposed: 'Are you ready,' he asked the Venetian
Assembly, 'to invest the Government with unlimited powers in order to
direct the defence and maintain order?' He warned them that he should be
obliged to impose upon them enormous sacrifices, but they replied by
voting the order of the day: 'Venice resists the Austrians at all costs;
to this end the President Manin is invested with plenary powers.' All the
deputies then raised their right hand, and swore to defend the city to the
last extremity. They kept their word.</p>

<p>It is hard to say which was the most admirable: Manin's fidelity to his
trust, or the people's fidelity to him. To keep up the spirits, to
maintain the decorum of a besieged city even for a few weeks or a few
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg.161]</a></span>
months, is a task not without difficulty; but when the months run into a
second year, when the real pinch of privations has been felt by everyone,
not as a sudden twinge, but as a long-drawn-out pain, when the bare
necessities of life fail, and a horrible disease, cholera, enters as
auxiliary under the enemy's black-and-yellow, death-and-pestilence flag;
then, indeed, the task becomes one which only a born leader of men could
perform.</p>

<p>The financial administration of the republic was a model of order and
economy. Generous voluntary assistance was afforded by all classes, from
the wealthy patrician and the Jewish merchant to the poorest gondolier.
Mazzini once said bitterly that it was easier to get his countrymen to
give their blood than their money; here they gave both. The capable manner
in which Manin conducted the foreign policy of the republic is also a
point that deserves mention, as it won the esteem even of statesmen of the
old school, though it was powerless to obtain their help.</p>

<p>The time was gone when France was disposed to do anything for Venice;
no one except the Archbishop of Paris, who was afterwards to die by the
hand of an assassin, said a word for her.</p>

<p>In the past year, Lord Palmerston, though he tried to localise the war,
and to prevent the co-operation of the south, abounded in good advice to
Austria. He repeated till he was tired of repeating, that she would do
well to retire from her Italian possessions of her own accord. If the
French did not come now, he said, they would come some day, and then her
friends and allies would give her scanty support. As for Lombardy, it was
notorious that a considerable Austrian party was in favour of giving it
up, including the Archduke Ranieri, who was strongly attached to Italy,
which was the land of his birth. As for <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg.162]</a></span> Venice, Austria had against
her both the principle of nationality, now the rallying cry of Germany,
and the principle of ancient prescription which could be energetically
invoked against her by a state to which her title went back no farther
than the transfer effected by Buonaparte in the treaty of Campo Formio.
These were his arguments; but he was convinced, by this time, that
arguments unsupported by big battalions might as well be bestowed on the
winds as on the Cabinet of Vienna. From the moment that Radetsky recovered
Lombardy for his master, the Italian policy of the Austrian Government was
entirely inspired by him, and he was determined that while he lived, what
Austria had got she should keep. It was thus that, in reply to Manin's
appeal to Lord Palmerston, he only received the cold comfort of the
recommendation that Venice should come to terms with her enemy.</p>

<p>The Venetian army of 20,000 men was reduced by casualties and sickness
to 18,000 or less. It always did its duty. The defence of Fort Malghera,
the great fort which commanded the road to Padua and the bridge of the
Venice railway, would have done credit to the most experienced troops in
the world. The garrison numbered 2500; the besiegers, under Haynau,
30,000. Radetsky, with three archdukes, came to see the siege, but, tired
with waiting, they went away before it was ended. The bombardment began on
the 4th of May; in the three days and nights ending with the 25th over
60,000 projectiles fell on the fort. During the night of the 25th the
Commandant, Ulloa, by order of Government, quietly evacuated the place,
and withdrew his troops; only the next morning the Austrians found out
that Malghera was abandoned, and proceeded to take possession of the heap
of ruins, which was all <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_163" id=
"Page_163">[Pg.163]</a></span> that remained.</p>

<p>After the beginning of July, an incessant bombardment was directed
against the city itself. Women and children lived in the cellars; fever
stalked through the place, but the war feeling was as strong as
ever&mdash;nay, stronger. Moreover, the provisions became daily scarcer,
the day came when hunger was already acutely felt, when the time might be
reckoned by hours before the famished defenders must let drop their
weapons, and Venice, her works of art and her population, must fall a prey
to the savage vengeance of the Austrians, who would enter by force and
without conditions.</p>

<p>And this is what Manin prevented. The cry was still for resistance; for
the first time bitter words were spoken against the man who had served his
country so well. But he, who had never sacrificed one iota to popularity,
did not swerve. His great influence prevailed. The capitulation was
arranged on the 22nd, and signed on the 24th of July. Manin had calculated
correctly; on that day there was literally nothing left to eat in
Venice.</p>

<p>In the last sad hours that Manin spent in Venice all the love of his
people, clouded for an instant, burst forth anew. Not, indeed, in shouts
and acclamations, but in tears and sobs; 'Our poor father, how much he has
suffered!' they were heard saying. He embarked on a French vessel bound
for Marseilles, poor, worn out and exiled for ever from the city which he
had guided for eighteen months; if, indeed, no spark of his spirit
animated the dust which it was the first care of liberated Venice to
welcome home. The Austrians broke up his doorstep on which, according to a
Venetian custom, his name was engraved. Another martyr, Ugo Bassi, had
kissed the stone, exclaiming:</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">
[Pg.164]</a></span> 'Next to God and Italy&mdash;before the
Pope&mdash;Manin!' The people gathered up the broken fragments and kept
them as relics, even as in their hearts they kept his memory, till the
arrival of that day of redemption which, in the darkest hour, he
foretold.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h4>'J'ATTENDS MON ASTRE'</h4>

<h5>1849-1850</h5>

<h5>The House of Savoy&mdash;A King who keeps his Word&mdash;Sufferings of
the Lombards&mdash;Charles Albert's Death.</h5>

<p>Circumstances more gloomy than those under which Victor Emmanuel II.
ascended the throne of his ancestors it would be hard to imagine.</p>

<p>An army twice beaten, a bankrupt exchequer, a triumphant invader
waiting to dictate terms; this was but the beginning of the inventory of
the royal inheritance. The internal condition of the kingdom, even apart
from the financial ruin which had succeeded to the handsome surplus of two
years before, was full of embarrassments of the gravest kind. There was a
party representing the darkest-dyed clericalism and reaction whose
machinations had not been absent in the disaster of Novara. Who was it
that disseminated among the troops engaged in the battle broadsides
printed with the words: 'Soldiers, for whom do you think you are fighting?
The King is betrayed; at Turin they have proclaimed the republic'? There
were other broadsides in which Austria was called the supporter of thrones
and altars. The dreadful indiscipline witnessed towards the end of, and
after the conflict was due more to the demoralising doctrines that had
been introduced into the army than to the insubordination of panic. There
was another party <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">
[Pg.166]</a></span> strengthened by the recent misfortunes and recruited
by exiles from all parts of Italy, which was democratic to the verge of
republicanism in Piedmont and over that verge at Genoa, where a revolution
broke out before the new King's reign was a week old. Constitutional
government stood between the fires of these two parties, both fanned by
Austrian bellows, the first openly, the second in secret.</p>

<p>Victor Emmanuel was not popular. The indifference to danger which he
had shown conspicuously during the war would have awakened enthusiasm in
most countries, but in Piedmont it was so thoroughly taken for granted
that the Princes of the House of Savoy did not know fear, that it was
looked on as an ordinary fact. The Austrian origin of the Duchess of Savoy
formed a peg on which to hang unfriendly theories. It is impossible not to
compassionate the poor young wife who now found herself Queen of a people
which hated her race, after having lived since her marriage the most
dreary of lives at the dismallest court in Europe. At first, as a bride,
she seemed to have a desire to break through the frozen etiquette which
surrounded her; it is told how she once begged and prayed her husband to
take her for a walk under the Porticoes of Turin, which she had looked at
only from the outside. The young couple enjoyed their airing, but when it
reached Charles Albert's ears, he ordered his son to be immediately placed
under military arrest. The chilling formalism which invaded even the
private life of these royal personages, shutting the door to 'good
comradeship' even between husband and wife, may have had much to do with
driving Victor Emmanuel from the side of the Princess, whom, nevertheless,
he loved and venerated, to unworthy pleasures, the habit of indulgence in
which is far easier to contract than to cure.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="VICTOR IMMANUEL" /><br />
 <span class="caption">VICTOR IMMANUEL</span></div>

<br />
 <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">
[Pg.167]</a></span> The King's address at this time was not conciliatory,
and, indeed, it never lost a bluntness which later harmonised well enough
with the reputation he gained for soldierly integrity, but which then
passed for aristocratic haughtiness. His personal friends were said to
belong to the aristocratic or even the reactionary party. In the
perplexities which encompassed him, he could not reckon on the
encouragement of any consensus of good opinion or confidence. He was
simply an unknown man, against whom there was a good deal of
prejudice.<br />
<br />
<p>Radetsky did not refuse to treat with Charles Albert, as has been
sometimes said, but the intolerably onerous terms first proposed by him
showed that he wished to force the abdication which Charles Albert had
always contemplated in the event of new reverses of fortune. Radetsky was
favourably disposed to the young Duke of Savoy, as far as his personal
feeling was concerned, a fact which was made out in certain quarters to be
almost a crime to be marked to the account of Victor Emmanuel. The
Field-Marshal did not forget that he was the son-in-law of the Austrian
Archduke Ranieri; it is probable, if not proved, that he expected to find
him pliable; but Radetsky, besides being a politician of the purest
blood-and-iron type, was an old soldier with not a bad heart, and some of
his sympathy is to be ascribed to a veteran's natural admiration for a
daring young officer.</p>

<p>On the 24th of March, Victor Emmanuel, with the manliness that was born
with him, decided to go and treat himself for the conditions of the
armistice. It was the first act of his reign, and it was an act of
abnegation; but of how much less humiliation than that performed by his
father twenty-eight years before, when almost on the same day, by <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg.168]</a></span> order
of King Charles Felix, the Prince of Carignano betook himself to the
Austrian camp at Novara, to be greeted with the derisive shout of: 'Behold
the King of Italy!' Little did Radetsky think that the words, addressed
then in scorn to the father, might to-day have been addressed in truthful
anticipation to the son.</p>

<p>The Field-Marshal took good care, however, that nothing but respect
should be paid to his visitor, whom he received half-way, surrounded by
his superb staff, all mounted on fine horses and clad in splendid
accoutrements. As soon as the King saw him coming, he sprang from his
saddle, and Radetsky would have done the same had not he required, owing
to his great age, the aid of two officers to help him to the ground. After
he had laboriously dismounted, he made a military salute, and then
embraced Victor Emmanuel with the greatest cordiality. The King was
accompanied by very few officers, but the presence of one of these was
significant, namely, of the Lombard Count Vimercati, whom he particularly
pointed out to Radetsky.</p>

<p>While observing the most courteous forms, the Field-Marshal was not
long in coming to the point. The negotiations would be greatly
facilitated, nay, more, instead of beginning his reign with a large slice
of territory occupied by a foreign enemy for an indefinite period, the
King might open it with an actual enlargement of his frontier, if he would
only give the easy assurance of ruling on the good old system, and of
re-hoisting the blue banner of Piedmont instead of the revolutionary
tricolor. The moment was opportune; Victor Emmanuel had not yet sworn to
maintain the Constitution. But he replied, without hesitation, that though
he was ready, if needs be, to accept the full penalties of defeat, he was
determined to observe the <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_169" id=
"Page_169">[Pg.169]</a></span> engagements entered into by his father
towards the people over whom he was called to reign.</p>

<p>One person had already received from his lips the same declaration,
with another of wider meaning. During the previous night, speaking to the
Lombard officer above mentioned, the King said: 'I shall preserve intact
the institutions given by my father; I shall uphold the tricolor flag,
symbol of Italian nationality, which is vanquished to-day, but which one
day will triumph. This triumph will be, henceforth, the aim of all my
efforts.' In 1874, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Novara, Count
Vimercati wrote to the King of Italy from Paris to remind him of the words
he had then spoken.</p>

<p>When the King started for his capital, Radetsky offered to draw up his
troops as a guard of honour over the whole extent of occupied territory
between Novara and Turin. The offer was declined, and Victor Emmanuel took
a circuitous route to avoid observation. His journey was marked throughout
by a complete absence of state. Before he arrived, a trusty hand consigned
to him a note written in haste and in much anguish by the Queen, in which
she warned him to enter by night, as he was likely to have a very bad
reception. On the 27th of March he reviewed the National Guard in the
Piazza Castello on the occasion of its taking the oath of allegiance. The
ceremony was attended by Queen Maria Adelaide in a carriage with her two
little boys, the Princes Umberto and Amedeo. There was no hostile
demonstration, but there was a most general and icy coldness.</p>

<p>That evening, the terms of the armistice were communicated to the
Chamber. As was natural, they evoked the wildest indignation, a part of
which fell undeservedly on the King. Twenty thousand Austrians were <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg.170]</a></span> to
occupy the district between the Po, Sesia and Ticino and half the citadel
of Alessandria. The excitement rose to its height when it was announced
that the Sardinian Fleet must be recalled from Venetian waters, depriving
that struggling city of the last visible sign of support from without. The
Chamber sent a deputation to the King, who succeeded in persuading its
members that, hard though the terms were, there was no avoiding their
acceptance, and that the original stipulations were harder still.</p>

<p>On the 29th, Victor Emmanuel took the oath to observe the Statute, to
exercise the royal authority only in virtue of the laws, to cause justice
to be fairly and fearlessly administered, and to conduct himself in all
things with the sole view to the interest, honour and prosperity of the
nation.</p>

<p>A trifling accident occurred which might have been far from trifling;
one of the ornaments of the ceiling of the Palazzo Madama, where the
Parliament assembled, fell close to the King. As it was of great weight,
it would have killed anyone on whom it had fallen. 'Never mind that,' said
the King in Piedmontese dialect to Colonel Menabrea, who was near him, 'it
will not be the last!'</p>

<p>The ministry which held office under the late King resigned; a new one
was formed, in which General Delaunay was President of the Council, and
Gioberti minister without a portfolio. The King was advised to dissolve
the Chamber, which had been elected as a war parliament, and was
ill-constituted to perform the work now required. General La Marmora had
orders to quell the insurrection at Genoa, the motive of which was not
nominally a change of government, but the continuance of the war at all
costs. Its deeper cause lay in the old <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg.171]</a></span> irreconcilability of
republican Genoa with her Piedmontese masters, breaking out now afresh
under the strain of patriotic disappointment. Like the 15th of May at
Naples, the Genoese revolution was a folly which can hardly be otherwise
described than as a crime; it happened, however, that in Piedmont there
was a King who had not the slightest intention of turning it into an
excuse for a royal hark-back. Austria and France offered Victor Emmanuel
their arms to put down the revolution, but, declining the not exactly
disinterested attention, he made a wise choice in La Marmora, who
accomplished the ungrateful task with expedition and humanity. An amnesty
was granted to all but a very few participators in the revolt. On the
brief black list when it was submitted to the King was the name of the
Marquis Lorenzo Pareto, who at one time had held the Foreign Office under
Charles Albert. As Colonel of the Genoese National Guard, his
responsibility in joining the insurrection was judged to be particularly
heavy; but the King refused to confirm his exclusion from the amnesty. 'I
would not have it said,' he objected, 'that I was harsh to one of my
father's old ministers.'</p>

<p>The conception of Victor Emmanuel as a bluff, easy-going monarch is
mistaken. Very few princes have had a keener sense of the royal dignity,
or a more deeply-rooted family pride, or, when he thought fit to resort to
it, a more decisive method of preventing people from taking liberties with
him. But he knew that, in nearly all cases, pardon is the best of a king's
prerogatives.</p>

<p>An instance to the point happened when he came to the throne. Two
officers of the royal household had caused him annoyance while he was Duke
of Savoy by telling tales of his unconventionality to his
easily-scandalised father. To them, perhaps, he owed the condign <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg.172]</a></span>
punishment he had undergone for the famous promenade under the Porticoes.
At anyrate, they had procured for the Duke many bad quarters-of-an-hour,
but the King, when he became King, chose to be completely oblivious of
their conduct, and they remained undisturbed at their posts. To those who
pointed to King Leopold of the Belgians, or to any other foreign example
of a loyal sovereign who understood the needs of his people as a model for
Victor Emmanuel to imitate, he was in the habit of replying: 'I remember
the history of my fathers, and it is enough.'</p>

<p>'The Persians,' says the Greek historian, 'taught their children to
ride and to speak the truth.' In a land that had seen as much of enthroned
effeminacy and mendacity as Italy had seen, a prince fond of manly
exercise and observant of his word was more valuable than a heaven-sent
genius, and more welcome than a calendar saint. Piedmont only could give
such a prince to Italy. Its kings were not Spaniards who, by way of
improvement, became lazzaroni, nor were they Austrians condemned by a
fatal law to revert to their original type; they were children of the ice
and snow, the fellow-countrymen of their subjects. All their traditions
told of obstinacy and hardihood. They brought their useful if scarcely
amiable moral qualities from Maurienne in the eleventh century. The second
Count of Savoy, known as Amadeus with the Tail, son of Humbert of the
White Hands, founder of the House, went to the Holy Roman Emperor with
such a body of retainers that the guards refused them entrance to the
Council Chamber. 'Either I shall go in with my Tail or not at all,' said
Humbert, and with his Tail he went in. This was the metal of the race.
Even at the time when they were vassals of the Empire, they expected to
dictate rather than to obey. They studiously married into all the great
royal houses of Europe. <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_173" id=
"Page_173">[Pg.173]</a></span> Though they persecuted their Vaudois
subjects, who were only in 1848 rewarded by emancipation for centuries of
unmerited sufferings and splendid fidelity, yet the Princes of Savoy had
from the first, from the White-Handed Humbert himself, held their heads
high in all transactions with the Holy See, between which and them there
was an ever-returning antagonism. Not to the early part of the nineteenth
century, when the rebound from revolutionary chaos did not suffice to
denationalise the Kings of Sardinia, but sufficed to ally them with
reaction, ought we to turn if we would seize the true bearings of the
development of the Counts of Maurienne into Kings of Italy. At that moment
the mission of Piedmont, though not lost, was obscured. What has rather to
be contemplated is the historic tendency, viewed as a whole, of both
reigning house and people. No one has pointed out that tendency more
clearly than the anonymous author of a pamphlet entitled <i>Le Testament
politique du Chevalier Walpole</i> (published at Amsterdam in 1769), who
was able to draw the horoscope of the House of Savoy with a correctness
which seems almost startling. He was not helped by either sympathy or
poetic imagination, but simply by political logic. Sardinia, he said, was
the best governed state in Europe. Instead of yielding to the indolent
apathy in which other reigning families were sunk, its princes sought to
improve its laws and develop its resources according to the wants of the
population and the exigences of the climate. Finance, police, the
administration of justice, military discipline, presented the picture of
order. From the nature of the situation, a King of Sardinia must be
ambitious, and to satisfy his ambition he had only to bide his time.
Placed between two great Powers he could choose for his ally whichever
would give him the most, and by playing this mute <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, it
was impossible that he would not <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_174"
id="Page_174">[Pg.174]</a></span> hereafter be called upon to play one of
the most important parts in Europe. Italy was the oyster disputed by
Austria and France; might it not happen that the King of Sardinia,
becoming judge and party, would devour the oyster and leave the shells to
the rival aspirants? It was unlikely, added this far-seeing observer, that
the Italian populations should have got so innured to their chains as to
prefer the harsh, vexatious government of Austria to the happy lot which
Sardinian domination would secure to them, but even if they had become
demoralised to this extent, they could not resist the providential advance
of a temperate, robust and warlike nation like Piedmont, led by a prince
as enlightened as the King (Charles Emmanuel) who then reigned over
it.</p>

<p>The metaphor of the oyster recalls another, that of Italy being an
artichoke which the House of Savoy was to devour, a leaf at a time.
Whether or not a Duke of Savoy really invented this often-quoted
comparison, it is certain that power was what the rulers of Piedmont cared
for. They were no more a race of scholars and art patrons than their
people was a people of artists and poets. There is a story to the effect
that one Duke of Savoy could never make out what poetry was, except that
it was written in half lines, which caused a great waste of paper. The
only poet born in Piedmont found the country unlivable. Recent research
among the archives at Turin revealed facts which were thought to be not
creditable to certain princely persons, and a gleaning was therefore made
of documents to which the historical student will no longer have access.
The step was ill advised; what can documents tell us on the subject that
we do not know? Did anyone suppose that the Savoy princes were commonly
saints? Sainthood has been the privilege of the women of the family, and
they have kept it <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">
[Pg.175]</a></span> mostly to themselves. But peccable and rough though
the members of this royal house may have been, very few of them were
without the governing faculty. 'C'est bien le souverain le plus fin que
j'ai connu en Europe,' said Thiers of Victor Emmanuel, whose acquaintance
he made in 1870, and in whom he found an able politician instead of the
common soldier he had expected. The remark might be extended back to all
the race. They understood the business of kings. A word not unlike the 'Tu
regere imperio populos, Romane, memento' of Virgil was breathed over the
cradle at Maurienne. If it did not send forth sons to rule the world, its
children were, at least, to be enthroned in the capital of the
C&aelig;sars, and to make Italy one for the first time since Augustus.</p>

<p>From April to August 1849, the peace negotiations dragged on. The
pretensions of Austria were still exorbitant, and she resisted the demand
which Piedmont, weak and reduced though she was, did not fear to make,
that she should amnesty her Italian subjects who had taken part in the
revolution. Unequal to cope with the difficulties of the situation, the
Delaunay ministry fell, and Massimo d'Azeglio was appointed President of
the Council. This was a good augury for Piedmont; D'Azeglio's patriotism
had received a seal in the wound which he carried away from the defence of
Vicenza. Honour was safe in his hands, whatever were the sacrifices to
which he might be obliged to consent.</p>

<p>Some pressure having been put on Austria by France and England, she
agreed in July to evacuate Alessandria, and to reduce the war indemnity
from 230,000,000 francs to 75,000,000, which Piedmont undertook to pay,
onerous though the charge was in her deplorable financial condition. But
the amnesty question was the last to be <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg.176]</a></span> settled, and in this Piedmont
stood alone. France and England gave her no support; The other powers were
against her. The Piedmontese special envoy at Milan, Count Pralormo, wrote
to Prince Schwarzenberg on the 2nd of July that his Government could not
give up this point. It was a conscientious duty so universally and
strongly felt, that they were readier to submit to the consequences,
whatever they might be, than to dishonour themselves by renouncing it. In
other words, they were ready to face a new war, abandoned to their fate by
all Europe, to undergo a new invasion, which meant the utter destruction
of their country, rather than leave their Lombard and Venetian
fellow-countrymen to the revenge of Austria. Count Pralormo added that he
was speaking not only in the name of the ministry, but of the King and the
whole nation. The risk was no imaginary one; there were many in Austria
who desired an excuse for crushing the life out of the small state which
was the eternal thorn in the side of that great Empire. Few remember now
the sufferings of Piedmont for Italy, or the perils, only too real, which
she braved again and again, not from selfish motives&mdash;for the
Piedmontese of the old, narrow school, who said that their orderly little
country had nothing to gain from being merged in a state of 25,000,000
were by no means in error&mdash;but from genuine Italian fellow-feeling
for their less happy compatriots beyond their confines.</p>

<p>At last, when the armistice concluded on the morrow of Novara had been
prolonged for five months, the treaty of peace was signed. Prince
Schwarzenberg offered to further reduce the indemnity, 75,000,000 to
71,000,000, but D'Azeglio having agreed to the former figure, preferred to
abide by his agreement. He thought, probably, that he would thus gain some
concession as to the amnesty, and, in fact, <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg.177]</a></span> Austria finally consented to
pardon all but a small number of the persons compromised in the late
events. D'Azeglio still stood out, but finding that there was no shadow of
a chance of obtaining more than this, he reluctantly accepted it. The
great mass, the hundred thousand and more fugitives who had left their
homes in Lombardy and Venetia, were, at any rate, promised a safe return.
The city of Venice, as yet undominated, though on the brink of her fall,
was totally excluded. The list of those whose banishment from Lombardy was
confirmed, comprises the noblest names in the province; with the exception
of a few who were excluded from the amnesty on the score that, before the
revolution, they were Austrian functionaries, nearly every unpardoned
Lombard was noble: Casati, Arese, Borromeo, Litta, Greppi, Pallavicini,
and the Princess Cristina Belgiojoso of Milan, the two Camozzis of
Bergamo, and G. Martinengo Cesaresco of Brescia.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that this amnesty ushered in a reign of
oblivion and mildness. It seemed, rather, that Austria, afraid of the
moral consequences of the return of so many unloving subjects, redoubled
her severity. The day following the promulgation of the amnesty was the
18th of August, the Emperor of Austria's birthday. In the morning,
placards dissuading the citizens from taking part in the official
rejoicings were to be seen on the walls of Milan. The persons who put
these up were not caught, but in the course of the day a crowd, consisting
of all classes, made what the official report called 'a scandalous and
anti-politic demonstration,' raising revolutionary cries, and even saying
uncomplimentary things of His Majesty, and worse still, of the Austrian
soldiers. During this 'shameful scene,' <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg.178]</a></span> of which the above is the
Austrian and hence the most highly-coloured description, the military
arrested at hazard some of the crowd, who, by a 'superior order,' were
condemned to the following pains and penalties:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
     1. Angelo Negroni, of Padua, aged thirty, proprietor, forty
      strokes;

     2. Carlo Bossi, watchmaker, aged twenty-two, forty strokes;

     3. Paolo Lodi, of Monza, student, aged twenty-one, thirty strokes;

     forty strokes;

     17. Maria Conti, of Florence, operatic singer, aged eighteen,
     thirty strokes.
</pre>

<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg.179]</a></span>


<p>There were other sentences of imprisonment in irons and on bread and
water, but the roll of the bastinado, extracted from the official <i>
Gazzetta di Milano</i> may be left to speak for all the rest, and to tell,
with a laconicism more eloquent than the finest rhetoric, what the
Austrian yoke in Italy really meant.</p>

<p>A few days after, the military commandant sent the Milanese
Municipality a bill for thirty-nine florins, the cost of rods broken or
worn-out, and of ice used to prevent gangrene, in the punishment
administered to the persons arrested on the 18th of August. Sixty strokes
with the Austrian stick were generally enough to prove fatal. Women were
flogged half-naked, together with the men, and in the presence of the
Austrian officers, who came to see the spectacle.</p>

<p>When the treaty of peace with Austria was signed, there arose a new
difficulty; the Sardinian Chamber of Deputies refused to approve it. Some
of the deputies asked why they should be called upon either to accept or
reject it, on which they were reminded of the 75,000,000 francs indemnity,
funds for the discharge of which could not be legally raised without a
parliamentary vote. The reluctance to share in an odious though necessary
responsibility made these novices in representative government anxious to
throw away the greatest, if not the sole guarantee of constitutional
freedom. Brofferio, by far the ablest man of the extreme radical party,
who had opposed all peace proposals as long as Rome and Venice still
resisted, now advised his friends to bow before the inevitable. But they
did not comply, and the ministers had no other alternative than to resort
to a fresh appeal to the country.</p>

<p>The crisis was serious, because no amount of loyalty on the part of the
head of the state can save liberty when the representatives of a <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg.180]</a></span>
nation, taking the bit between their teeth, set themselves deliberately to
work to make government impossible. People are too fond of talking of
liberty as if it were something locked up in a box which remains safe as
long as the guardian of the box does not steal it or sell it. Liberty is
in the charge of all and at the mercy of all. There were not wanting
persons who blamed the new dissolution as unconstitutional, and who called
the proclamation of Moncalieri which announced it an act of despotism and
of improper interference with the independence of the electors. It is
hardly too much to say that it was this royal proclamation that saved
Piedmont. The King appealed to Italy and to Europe for judgment on the
conduct of the late Chamber. Having signed, he said, a 'not ruinous'
treaty with Austria, which the honour of the country and the sanctity of
his word required to be faithfully executed, the majority sought to make
that execution legally impracticable. He continued: 'I have promised to
save the nation from the tyranny of parties, whatever be the name, scope
and position of the men who constitute them. These promises I fulfil by
dissolving a Chamber which had become impossible, and by convoking the
immediate assemblage of another parliament; but if the electors of the
country deny me their help, not on me will fall henceforth the
responsibility of the future; and if disorders follow, let them complain,
not of me, but of themselves. Never, up till now, has the House of Savoy
had recourse in vain to the faithfulness, wisdom and honour of its
peoples. I have therefore the right to trust in them on the present
occasion, and to hold for certain that, united together, we shall save the
constitution and the country from the dangers by which they are
menaced.'</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">
[Pg.181]</a></span> The Proclamation produced a great effect, and the
parliament which met on the 20th of December contained a working majority
of men who were not only patriotic, but who were also endowed with common
sense. When the ratification of the peace came on for discussion, there
was, indeed, one deputy who spoke in favour of immediate war, which, in a
fortnight, was to effect the liberation, not only of Lombardy and Venetia,
but also of Hungary, a speech worth recalling, as it shows how far madness
will go. The debate concluded with a vote authorising the King's
government to fully carry out the treaty of peace which was concluded at
Milan on the 6th of August 1849, the ayes being 137 against 17 noes.
Piedmont had learnt the bitter but useful lesson, that if you play and
lose, you must pay the cost. He who had played and lost his crown had
already paid the last fee to fortune. Charles Albert was now a denizen of
the Superga&mdash;of all kings' burial places, the most inspiring in its
history, the most sublime in its situation. Here Victor Amadeus, as he
looked down on the great French army which, for three months, had besieged
his capital, vowed to erect a temple if it should please the Lord of Hosts
to grant him and his people deliverance from the hands of the enemy. Five
days later the French were in flight. All the Alps, from Mon Viso to the
Simplon, all Piedmont, and beyond Piedmont, Italy to the Apennines, can be
scanned from the church which fulfilled the royal vow.</p>

<p>To the Superga the body of Charles Albert was brought from the place of
exile. Before the coffin, his sword was carried; after it, they led the
war-horse he had ridden in all the battles. After the war-horse followed a
great multitude. He had said truly that it was an opportune <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg.182]</a></span> time for
him to die. The pathos of his end rekindled the affections of the people
for the dynasty.</p>

<p>As in the Mosque of dead Sultans in Stamboul, so in the Mausoleum of
the Superga, each sovereign occupied the post of honour only till the next
one came to join him. But the post of honour remains, and will remain, to
Charles Albert. His son lies elsewhere.</p>

<h4>THE REVIVAL OF PIEDMONT</h4>

<h5>1850-1856</h5>

<h5>Restoration of the Pope and Grand Duke of Tuscany&mdash;Misrule at
Naples&mdash;The Struggle with the Church in Piedmont&mdash;The Crimean
War.</h5>

<br />
<p>The decade from 1849 to 1859 may seem, at first sight, to resemble an
interregnum, but it was an evolution. There is no pause in the life of
nations any more than in the life of individuals: they go forward or they
go backward. In these ten years Piedmont went forward; the other Italian
governments did not stand still, they went backward. The diseases from
which they suffered gained daily upon the whole body-politic, and even
those clever foreign doctors who had been the most convinced that this or
that remedy would set them on their feet, were in the end persuaded that
there was only one place for them&mdash;the Hospital for Incurables. After
the fall of Rome, Pius IX. issued a sort of canticle from Gaeta, in which
he thanked the Lord at whose bidding the stormy ocean had been arrested,
but he did not even so much as say thank you to the French, without whom,
nevertheless, the stormy ocean would have proceeded on its way. To all
suggestions from Paris that now that victory had been won by force the
time was come for the Sovereign to give some guarantee that it would not
be abused, <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">
[Pg.184]</a></span> the Pope turned a completely deaf ear. 'The Pope,'
said M. Drouyn de Lhuys, 'prefers to return to Rome upon the dead bodies
of his subjects rather than amidst the applause which would have greeted
him had he taken our advice.' That advice referred in particular to the
secularisation of the public administration, and this was exactly what the
Pope and the ex-Liberal Cardinal Antonelli, now and henceforth his most
influential counsellor, were determined not to concede. They had grown
wise in their generation, for a priest whose ministers are laymen is as
much an anomaly as a layman whose ministers are priests. The French
government desired that the Statute should be maintained, and demanded
judicial reforms and an amnesty for political offenders. None of these
points was accepted except the last, and that only nominally, as the
amnesty of the 18th of September did not put a stop to proscriptions and
vindictive measures. Count Mamiani, whose stainless character was
venerated in all Italy, and who had devoted all his energies to the
attempt to save the Papal government after the Pope's flight, was
ruthlessly excluded, and so were many other persons who, though
liberal-minded, had shown signal devotion to the Holy See. All sorts of
means were used to serve the ends of vengeance; for instance, Alessandro
Calandrelli, a Roman of high reputation, who held office under the
republic, was condemned to death for high treason, and to twenty years at
the galleys, on a trumped-up charge of theft, which was palpably absurd;
but the Pope, while quashing the first sentence, confirmed the second, and
Calandrelli would have remained in prison till the year of grace 1870, as
many others did, but for the chance circumstance that his father had been
a friend of the King of Prussia, who took up his cause so warmly that
after two years he was <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_185" id=
"Page_185">[Pg.185]</a></span> let out and sent to Berlin, where the King
and A. von Humboldt received him with open arms.</p>

<p>These were the auspices under which Pius IX. returned to Rome after
seventeen months' absence. A four-fold invasion restored the Temporal
Power, which F&eacute;nelon said was the root of all evil to the Church,
but which, according to Pius IX., was necessary to the preservation of the
Catholic religion. The re-established <i>r&eacute;gime</i> was
characterised by Lord Clarendon at the Congress of Paris as 'the
opprobrium of Europe.' The Pope tried to compensate for his real want of
independence (for a prince who could not stand a day without foreign
bayonets, whatever else he was, was not independent) by laughing at the
entreaties of France to relieve that advanced nation from the annoyance of
having set up a government fit for the Middle Ages. He rated at its
correct value the support of Napoleon, and believing it to be purely
interested, he believed in its permanence. The President had thought of
nothing in the world but votes, and he thought of them still. The Roman
Expedition secured him the services of M. de Falloux as minister, and won
over to him the entire Clerical Party, including Montalembert and the
so-called Liberal Catholics. Thus, and thus only, was the leap from the
Presidential chair to the Imperial throne made possible. The result was
flattering, but still there are reasons to think (apart from Prince
J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Napoleon's express statement to that effect) that
Napoleon III. hated the whole business from the bottom of his soul, and
that of his not few questionable acts, this was the only one of which he
felt lastingly ashamed. Seeing that the communications of his ministers
failed in their object, he tried the expedient of writing a private letter
to his friend Edgar Ney, couched in the <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg.186]</a></span> strongest terms of
disapproval of the recalcitrant attitude of the Papal Government. This
letter was published as it was intended to be, but in the Roman States,
except that its circulation was forbidden, no notice was taken of it.
Though the incident may be regarded as a stroke of facing-both-ways
policy, the anger expressed was probably as sincere as any of Napoleon's
sentiments could be, and the letter had the effect of awakening the idea
in many minds that something of the former Italian conspirator still
existed in the ruler of France. The question arose, What sort of pressure
would be needed to turn that germ to account for Italy?</p>

<p>In the kingdom of Naples, where the laws, to look at them on paper,
were incomparably better than those in force in the Roman States, the
administration was such as would have disgraced a remote province of the
Turkish Empire. The King's naturally suspicious temperament was worked
upon by his courtiers and priests till he came to detect in every Liberal
a personal antagonist, whose immunity from harm was incompatible with his
own, and in Liberalism a plague dangerous to society, which must be
stamped out at all costs. Over 800 Liberals were sent to the galleys. The
convictions were obtained, in a great proportion of cases, by false
testimony. Bribes and secret protection in high quarters were the only
means by which an innocent man could hope to escape; 50,000 persons were
under police supervision, to be imprisoned at will. The police often
refused to set at liberty those whom the judges had acquitted. The
government had a Turkish or Russian fear of printed matter. A wretched
barber was fined 1000 ducats for having in his possession a volume of
Leopardi's poems, which was described as 'contrary to religion and
morals.'</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">
[Pg.187]</a></span> What was meant by being an inmate of a Neapolitan
prison was told by Mr Gladstone in his two 'Letters to the Earl of
Aberdeen,' which the latter sent to Prince Schwarzenberg, the Austrian
Prime Minister, with a strong appeal to him to make known their contents
to the King of the Two Sicilies, and to use his influence in procuring a
mitigation of the abuses complained of. Prince Schwarzenberg did nothing,
and it was then that the 'Letters' were published. The impression created
on public opinion was almost without a parallel. The celebrated phrase,
'The negation of God erected into a system of government,' passing into
currency as a short history of Bourbon rule at Naples, kept alive the
wrathful feelings which the 'Letters' aroused, even when these ceased to
be read. Some small errors of fact (such as that of stating that all the
prisoners were chained, whereas an exception was made of those undergoing
life sentences) were magnified by the partisans of Ferdinand II.; but the
truth of the picture as a whole was amply confirmed from independent
sources. Baron Carlo Poerio (condemned to nineteen years' imprisonment)
<i>was</i> chained to a common malefactor, the chain never being undone,
and producing in the end a disease of the bone from which he never
recovered. His case was that of all the political prisoners in the same
category with himself. Luigi Settembrini and the others on whom sentence
of death had been passed, but commuted into one of life imprisonment, were
not chained, but they were put to associate with the worst thieves and
assassins, while their material surroundings accorded with the moral
atmosphere they were forced to breathe.</p>

<p>The Neapolitan prisoners did more than suffer for freedom; they
delivered the name of their country from being a reproach among the
nations. They showed what men the South of Italy can produce. Those <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg.188]</a></span> who
wish to know what types of probity, honour and ideal patriotism may grow
out of that soil, which is sometimes charged with yielding only the rank
weeds planted by despotism, may read the letters and memoirs of the noble
Poerios, of Settembrini, gentlest but most fearless of human souls, of the
Calabrian Morellis, all patriots and martyrs; of the Duke of
Castromediano, who lately, in his old age, has set down a few
recollections of the years he spent at the Neapolitan galleys. He records
in these notes what he calls the most perilous moment in his life. It was
when he was summoned, with six fellow-prisoners who had asked for and
obtained freedom, to hear, as he feared, his own pardon pronounced. For
pardon was equivalent to dishonour; it was granted either in consequence
of real submission and retraction, or in order to be able to blacken the
character of the pardoned man by falsely asserting that such submission
had been made. His fear was groundless. He had been led out, perhaps, in
the hope that the example of the others would prove contagious. He was not
pardoned. As he returned to his prison, he thanked Divine Providence for
the chains which left him pure.</p>

<p>Strange to tell, Ferdinand II. rendered one considerable service to the
national cause; not that he saw it in that light, but the service was none
the less real because its motive was a narrow one. Austria proposed a
defensive league between the Italian Sovereigns: defensive not only with
the view to outward attack, but also and chiefly against 'internal
disorder.' Piedmont was to be invited to join as soon as she had renounced
her constitutional sins, which it was sanguinely expected she would do
before very long. Meanwhile Parma, Modena, Tuscany and Rome embraced the
idea with enthusiasm, but the King of <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg.189]</a></span> the Two Sicilies, who dimly
saw in it an opening for interference in his own peculiar governmental
ways, boldly declined to have anything to do with it. And so, to Prince
Schwarzenberg's serious disappointment, the scheme by which he had hoped
to create an absolutist Italian federation, came to an untimely end.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke of Tuscany timidly inquired of the Austrian premier if
he might renew the constitutional <i>r&eacute;gime</i> in his state.
Schwarzenberg replied with the artful suggestion that he should hear what
the Dukes of Modena and Parma, the Pope, and King Ferdinand had to say on
the subject. Their advice was unanimously negative: Cardinal Antonelli
going so far as to declare that Constitutionalism in Tuscany would be
regarded as a constant menace and danger to the States of the Church. The
different counsels of Piedmont, conveyed by Count Balbo, weighed little
against so imposing an array of opinion, backed as it was by the Power
which still stabled its horses in the Convent of San Marco. The Tuscan
Statute was formally suspended in September 1850.</p>

<p>From that day forth, Tuscany sank lower and lower in the slough. To
please the Pope, havoc was made of the Leopoldine laws&mdash;named after
the son of Maria Theresa, the wise Grand Duke Leopold I.&mdash;laws by
which a bridle was put on the power and extension of the Church. The
prosecution and imprisonment of a Protestant couple who were accused of
wishing to make proselytes, proclaimed the depth of intolerance into which
what was once the freest and best-ordered government in Italy had
descended.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical question became the true test question in Piedmont
as well as in Tuscany, but there it had another issue.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">
[Pg.190]</a></span> It had also a different basis. In Piedmont there were
no Leopoldine laws to destroy; what was necessary was to create them. To
privileges dating from the Middle Ages which in the kingdom of Sardinia
almost alone had been restored without curtailment after the storm of the
French Revolution, were added the favours, the vast wealth, the
preponderating influence acquired during Charles Felix' reign, and the
first seventeen years of that of Charles Albert. Theoretically, the
Statute swept away all privileges of classes and sects, and made citizens
equal before the law, but to put this theory into practice further
legislation was needed, because, as a matter of fact, the clergy preserved
their immunities untouched and showed not the slightest disposition to
yield one jot of them. The Piedmontese clergy, more numerous in proportion
to the population than in any state except Rome, were more intransigent
than any ecclesiastical body in the world. The Italian priest of old days,
whatever else might be said about him, was rarely a fanatic. The very
nickname 'Ultramontane' given by Italians to the religious extremists
north of the Alps, shows how foreign such excesses were to their own
temperaments. But the Ultramontane spirit had already invaded Piedmont,
and was embraced by its clergy with all the zeal of converts. There was
still a <i>Foro Ecclesiastico</i> for the arraignment of religious
offenders, and this was one of the first privileges against which Massimo
d'Azeglio lifted his 'sacrilegious' hand. To go through all the list would
be tedious, and would demand more explanation regarding the local modes of
acquisition and tenure of religious property than would be interesting
now. The object of the Siccardi laws, as they were named after the
Minister of Grace and Justice who introduced them, and of the stronger
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg.191]</a></span>
measures to which they led up, was to make the priest amenable to the
common law of the land in all except that which referred to his spiritual
functions; to put a limit on the amassment of wealth by religious
corporations; to check the multiplication of convents and the
multiplication of feast days, both of which encouraged the people in sloth
and idleness; to withdraw education from the sole control of
ecclesiastics; and finally, to authorise civil marriage, but without
making it compulsory. The programme was large, and it took years to carry
it out. The Vatican contended that it was contrary to the Concordat which
existed between the Holy See and the Court of Sardinia. Massimo d'Azeglio
replied that the maintenance of the Concordat, in all its parts, meant the
ruin of the state; that he had tried every means of conciliation, made
every effort towards arriving at a compromise, and that since his
endeavours had failed in consequence of the refusal of the Vatican to
abate pretensions which it neither could nor did enforce in Austria,
Naples or Spain, heaven and the world must judge between Rome and
Piedmont, between Cardinal Antonelli and himself.</p>

<p>The struggle throughout was bitter in the extreme, but its most
striking incident was the denial of the last Sacraments to a member of the
Government, the Minister of Agriculture, Santa Rosa, who happened to die
soon after the passing of the Act abolishing the <i>Foro
Ecclesiastico</i>. Santa Rosa was a sincerely religious man, but he
resisted all the attempts of the priest to extort a retractation, and died
unabsolved rather than leave a dishonoured name to his children. The
popular indignation excited by this incident was in proportion with the
importance attached to outward observances of religion in Catholic
countries; the government had to protect the Archbishop of <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg.192]</a></span> Turin from
violence, while, at the same time, they sent him for a month to the
Citadel for having forbidden his clergy to obey the law on the <i>Foro
Ecclesiastico</i>. He and one or two of the other bishops were afterwards
expelled from the kingdom. An unwelcome necessity, but whose was the
fault? In other countries, where the privileges claimed by the Piedmontese
clergy had been abolished for centuries, did the bishops dictate revolt
against the law? If not, why should they do so in Piedmont?</p>

<p>The successor of Santa Rosa in the ministry was Count Cavour, who thus
in 1850 for the first time became an official servant of the state. When
D'Azeglio submitted the appointment to the King, Victor Emmanuel remarked
that, though he did not object to it in the least, they had better take
care, as this man would turn them all out before long. This man was, in
fact, to stand at the helm of Piedmont, with short intervals, till he
died, and was to carve out from the block of formless marble, not the
Italy of sublime dreams, which, owing her deliverance to her sons alone,
should arise immaculate from the grave a Messiah among the nations, but
the actual Italy which has been accomplished; imperfect and peccable as
human things mostly are, belonging rather to prose than to poetry, to
matter than to spirit, but, for all that, an Italy which is one and is
free.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="COUNT CAVOUR" /><br />
 <span class="caption">COUNT CAVOUR</span></div>

<br />


<p>Fifty years ago a great English writer pointed out what the real Italy
would be, if it were to be; 'The prosperity of nations as of individuals,'
wrote Mr Ruskin in one of his earliest papers, 'is cold and hard-hearted
and forgetful. The dead lie, indeed, trampled down by the living; the
place thereof shall know them no more, for that place is not in the hearts
of the survivors, for whose interest they have made way.<span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg.193]</a></span> But
adversity and ruin point to the sepulchre, and it is not trodden on; to
the chronicle, and it does not decay. Who would substitute the rush of a
new nation, the struggle of an awakening power, for the dreamy sleep of
Italy's desolation, for the sweet silence of melancholy thought, her
twilight time of everlasting memories?'</p>

<p>There is the case, stated with beautiful lucidity, of the somewhat
ghoulish dilettantism which, enjoying tombs, would condemn all mankind to
breathe their atmosphere. It is not, however, in order to discuss that
view that the passage is quoted, but because of its relevancy to what
Cavour attempted and what he did. Never was there a mind which cherished
fewer illusions. He believed that the pursuit of the unattainable was
still more a political crime than a political blunder. He was, in this,
what is now called an opportunist, and he was also an opportunist in
believing that though in politics you can choose your aim, you can very
rarely choose your means. He held (and this was the reason that he was so
profoundly hated by men of very different parties) that to accomplish
great changes you have to make sacrifices, not only of the higher sort,
but, in a certain sense, also of the lower. As he thought that the
Austrians could not be expelled from Italy for good and all without
foreign help, he contemplated from the first securing that foreign help,
though no one would have been more glad than he to do without it. He
thought that Italian freedom could not be won without a closer alliance
with the democratic party than politicians like D'Azeglio, who had the
fear of the ermine, of tarnishing its whiteness, would have ever brought
themselves to acquiesce in, and he therefore immediately took steps to
establish that alliance. Cavour had no faith in the creation of ideally
perfect <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">
[Pg.194]</a></span> states, such as the Monarchy of Dante or the Republic
of Mazzini, but he did think that a living land was better than a dead
one, that the struggle of an awakening power, the rush of a new nation,
was infinitely to be preferred to the desolation of dreamy sleeps, sweet
silences, and everlasting memories that spelt regrets.</p>

<p>It may be possible now to see clearly that if no one had tried for the
unattainable, Cavour would not have found the ground prepared for his
work. The appreciation of his rank among Italian liberators rests on a
different point, and it is this: without a man of his positive mould, of
his practical genius, of his force of will and force of patience, would
the era of splendid endeavours have passed into the era of accomplished
facts? If the answer to this is 'No,' then nothing can take from Cavour
the glory of having conferred an incalculable boon on the country which he
loved with a love that was not the less strong because it lacked the
divinising qualities of imagination.</p>

<p>An aristocrat by birth and the inheritor of considerable wealth, Cavour
was singularly free from prejudices; his favourite study was political
economy, and in quiet times he would probably have given all his energies
to the interests of commerce and agriculture. He was an advocate of free
trade, and was, perhaps, the only one of the many Italians who <i>
f&ecirc;ted</i> Mr Cobden on his visit to Italy who cared in the least for
the motive of his campaign. Cavour understood English politics better than
they have ever been understood by a foreign statesman; his article on
Ireland, written in 1843, may still be read with profit. Before
parliamentary life existed in Piedmont, he took the only way open of
influencing public opinion by founding a newspaper, the <i>
Risorgimento,</i> in which he continued to write for <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg.195]</a></span> several
years. In the Chamber of Deputies he soon made his power felt&mdash;power
is the word, for he was no orator in the ordinary sense; his speeches read
well, as hard hitting and logical expositions, but they were not well
delivered. Cavour never spoke Italian with true grace and ease though he
selected it for his speeches, and not French, which was also allowed and
which he spoke admirably. His presence, too, did not lend itself to
oratory; short and thickset, and careless in his dress, he formed a
contrast to the romantic figure of D'Azeglio. Yet his prosaic face, when
animated, gave an impressive sense of that attribute which seemed to
emanate from the whole man: power.</p>

<p>It needed a more wary hand than D'Azeglio's to steer out of the
troubled waters caused by the ecclesiastical bills, and to put the final
touches to the legislation which he, to his lasting honour be it said, had
courageously and successfully initiated. In the autumn of 1852 D'Azeglio
resigned, and Cavour was requested by the King to form a ministry. He was
to remain, with short breaks, at the head of public affairs for the nine
following years.</p>

<p>At this time the government of Lombardy and Venetia was vested in
Field-Marshal Radetsky, with two lieutenant-governors under him, who only
executed his orders. Radetsky resided at Verona. Politically and
economically the two provinces were then undergoing an extremity of
misery; the diseases of the vines and the silkworms had reached the point
of causing absolute ruin to the great mass of proprietors who, reckoning
on having always enough to live on, had not laid by. Many noble families
sank to the condition of peasants. The taxation was heavier than in any
other part of the Austrian Empire; in proof of <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg.196]</a></span> which it may be
mentioned that Lombardy paid 80,000,000 francs into the Austrian treasury,
which, had the Empire been taxed equally, would have given an annual total
of 1,100,000,000, whereas the revenue amounted to only 736,000,000. The
landtax was almost double what it was in the German provinces. Italians,
however, have a great capacity for supporting such burdens with patience,
and it is doubtful whether the material aspect of the case did much to
increase their hatred of foreign dominion. Its moral aspect grew daily
worse; the terror became chronic. The possession of a sheet of printed
paper issued by the revolutionary press at Capolago, on the lake of
Lugano, was enough to send a man to the gallows. These old, badly printed
leaflets, with no name of author or publisher attached, but chiefly
written in the unmistakable style of Mazzini, can still be picked up in
the little booksellers' shops in Canton Ticino, and it is difficult to
look at them without emotion. What hopes were carried by them. What risks
were run in passing them from hand to hand. Of what tragedies were they
not the cause! In August 1851, Antonio Sciesa, of Milan, was shot for
having one such leaflet on his person. The gendarmes led him past his own
house, hoping that the sight of it would weaken his nerve, and make him
accept the clemency which was eagerly proffered if he would reveal the
names of others engaged in the patriotic propaganda. 'Tiremm innanz!'
('come along') he said, in his rough Milanese dialect, and marched
incorruptible to death. On a similar charge, Dottesio and Grioli, the
latter a priest, suffered in the same year, and early in 1852 the long
trial was begun at Mantua of about fifty <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg.197]</a></span> patriots whose names had been
obtained by the aid of the bastinado from one or two unhappy wretches who
had not the fortitude to endure. Of these fifty, nine were executed, among
whom were the priests Grazioli and Tazzoli, Count Montanari of Verona, and
Tito Speri, the young hero of the defence of Brescia. Speri had a trifling
part in the propaganda, but the remembrance of his conduct in 1849 ensured
his condemnation. He was deeply attached to the religion in which he was
born, and his last letters show the fervour of a Christian joined to the
calmness of a stoic. If he had a regret, it was that he had been unable to
do more for his country; but here too his simple faith sustained him.
Surely the Giver of all good would not refuse to listen to the prayers of
the soul which passed to Him through martyrdom. 'To-morrow they lead me
forth,' he wrote. 'I have done with this world, but, in the bosom of God,
I promise you I will do what I can.' So did this clear and childlike
spirit carry its cause from the Austrian Assizes to a higher tribunal.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1853 there was an attempt at a rising in Milan from
which the mass of the citizens stood aloof, if they even knew of it till
it was over; an attempt ill-considered and not easily justified from any
point of view, the blame for which has been generally cast on Mazzini; but
though he knew of it, he was unwilling that its authors should choose the
time and mode of action which they chose. He was, moreover, misinformed as
to the extent of the preparations, since no Milanese of any standing gave
his support to the plan.</p>

<p>On the plea that the Lombard emigration was concerned in the abortive
movement, which was by no means consistent with facts, the Austrian
Government sequestered the landed property of the exiles and voluntary
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg.198]</a></span>
emigrants, reducing them and their families (which in most instances
remained behind) to complete beggary. Nine hundred and seventy-eight
estates were placed under sequestration. The Court of Sardinia held the
measure to be a violation of the amnesty, which was one of the conditions
of the peace of 1850. The Sardinian Minister was recalled from Vienna, and
the relations between the two governments were once more on a footing of
open rupture.</p>

<p>Not less important was the moral effect of the sequestrations in France
and England, but particularly in England. They acted as the last straw,
coming as they did on the top of the flogging system which had already
enraged the English public mind to the highest degree. The Prince Consort
wrote in March to his brother: 'To give you a conception of the maxims of
justice and policy which Austria has been lately developing, I enclose an
extract of a report from Turin which treats of the decrees of confiscation
in Italy. People here will be very indignant.' He goes on to say (somewhat
too broadly) that the English upper classes were till then thoroughly
Austrian, but that she had succeeded in turning the whole of England
against her, and there was now no one left to defend her.</p>

<p>Austria, through Count Buol, complained that she was 'dying of
legality,' but England took the Sardinian view that the sequestrations
directly violated the treaty between the two Powers. In the Austrian Note
of the 9th of March, it was distinctly declared that Piedmont would be
crushed if she did not perform the part of police-agent to Austria.
Cavour's uncowed attitude at this crisis was what first fixed upon him the
eyes of European diplomacy.</p>

<p>In the course of the summer, the Duke of Genoa, Victor Emmanuel's
brother, paid a visit to the English Court, where the Duke of <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg.199]</a></span> Saxe-Coburg
was also staying, by whom he was described as 'one of the cleverest and
most amiable men of our time.' Sunny Italy, adds Duke Ernest, seemed to
have sent him to England so that by his mere presence alone, in the prime
of his age, he might make propaganda for the cause of his country. The
Queen presented her guest with a handsome riding-horse, and when he
thanked her in warm and feeling terms, she spoke the memorable words, the
effect of which spoken at that date by the Queen of England can hardly be
imagined: 'I hope you will ride this horse when the battles are fought for
the liberation of Italy.'</p>

<p>The battle-day was indeed to come, but when it came the sword which the
young Duke wielded with such gallantry in the siege of Peschiera would be
sheathed for ever. The Prince Charming of Casa Savoia died in February
1855, leaving a daughter to Italy, the beloved Queen Margaret.</p>

<p>In the space of a few weeks, Victor Emmanuel lost his brother, his
mother, and his wife. The King, who felt keenly when he did feel, was
driven distraught with grief; no circumstance was wanting which could
sharpen the edge of his sorrow. The two Queens, both Austrian princesses,
had never interfered in foreign politics; what they suffered they suffered
in silence. But they were greatly influenced by the ministers of the
religion which had been a comfort of their not too happy lives, and they
had frequently told Victor Emmanuel that they would die of grief if the
anti-papal policy of his government were persisted in. Now that they were
dead, every partisan of the Church declared, without a shadow of
reticence, that the mourning in which the House of Savoy was plunged was a
clear manifestation of Divine wrath. Victor Emmanuel had been brought up
in superstitious surroundings; it was hardly possible that he should
listen to these <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">
[Pg.200]</a></span> things altogether unmoved. But on this as on the other
occasions in his life when he was to be threatened with ghostly terrors,
he did not belie the name of 'Re Galantuomo,' which he had written down as
his profession when filling up the papers of the first census taken after
his accession&mdash;a jest that gave him the title he will ever be known
by. Harassed and tormented as the King was, when the law on religious
corporations had been voted by the Senate and the Chamber, and was
presented to him by Cavour for signature, he did his duty and signed it.
The commentary which came from the Vatican was the decree of major
excommunication promulgated in the Consistory of the 27th of July against
all who had approved or sanctioned the measure, or who were concerned in
putting it into execution.</p>

<p>The law was known as the 'Rattazziana,' from Urbano Rattazzi, whom
Cavour appointed Minister of Grace and Justice, thereby effecting a
coalition between the Right Centre, which he led himself, and the Left
Centre, which was led by Rattazzi; an alliance not pleasing to the Pure
Right or to the Advanced Left, but necessary to give the Prime Minister
sufficient strength to command the respect, both at home and abroad, which
can only be won by a statesman who is not afraid of being overturned by
every whiff of the parliamentary wind. The 'Legge Rattazziana' certainly
aimed at asserting the supremacy of the state, but in substance it was an
arrangement for raising the stipend of the poorer clergy at the expense of
the richer benefices and corporations, and save for the bitter animosity
of Rome, it would not have excited the degree of anger that descended upon
its promoters. In a country where the Church had a rental of 15,000,000
francs, there were many <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_201" id=
"Page_201">[Pg.201]</a></span> parish priests who had not an income of
&pound;20; a state of things seen to be anomalous by the best
ecclesiastics themselves, but their efforts at conciliation failed because
the Holy See would not recognise the right of the civil authority to
interfere in any question affecting the status or property of the clergy,
and this right was the real point at issue.</p>

<p>In these days, Cavour came to an understanding with a friendly monk in
order that when his last hour arrived, he should not, like Santa Rosa, go
unshriven to his account. In 1861, Fra Giacomo performed his part in the
agreement, and was duly punished for having saved his Church from a
scandal which, from the position of the great minister, would have reached
European dimensions.</p>

<p>Cavour's work of bringing into order the Sardinian finances, which,
from the flourishing state they had attained prior to 1848, had fallen
into what appeared the hopeless confusion of a large and steadily
increasing deficit, is not to the ordinary observer his most brilliant
achievement, but it is possibly the one for which he deserves most praise.
It could not have been carried through except by a statesman who was
completely indifferent to the applause of the hour. During all the earlier
years that he held office, Cavour was extraordinarily unpopular. The
nickname of 'la bestia neira' conferred on him by Victor Emmanuel referred
to the opinion entertained of him by the Clerical party, but he was almost
as much a 'bestia neira' to a large portion of the Liberals as to the
Clericals or to the old Piedmontese party. His house was attacked by the
mob in 1853, and had not his servants barred the entrance, something
serious might have occurred. Happily the King and the majority in the
Chamber and in the country had, if not much love for Cavour, a profound
conviction that he could not be done without, and that, consequently, he
must be allowed to do <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_202" id=
"Page_202">[Pg.202]</a></span> what he liked. Thus the large sacrifices he
demanded of the taxpayers were regularly voted, and Cavour could afford to
despise the abuse heaped upon himself since he saw his policy advancing to
maturity along a steady line of success.</p>

<p>When, in 1854, Cavour resolved that Piedmont should join France and
England in the coming war with Russia, it seemed to a large number of his
countrymen that he had taken leave of his senses, but the firm support
which in this instance he found in the King enabled him next year to equip
and despatch the contingent, 15,000 strong, commanded by General La
Marmora, which not only won the respect of friends and foes in the field,
but offered an example of efficiency in all departments that compared
favourably with the faulty organisation of the great armies beside which
it fought. Its gallant conduct at the battle of the Tchernaja flattered
the native pride, and when, in due time, 12,000 returned of the 15,000
that had gone forth, the increased credit of Piedmont in Europe was
already felt to compensate for the heavy cost of the expedition.</p>

<p>Among the Italians living abroad, Cavour's motives in taking part in
the Crimean War were, from the first, better understood than they were at
home. Piedmont, by qualifying for the part of Italian advocate in the
Councils of Europe, gave a guarantee of good faith which patriots like
Daniel Manin and Giorgio Pallavicini accepted as a happy promise for the
future. It was then that a large section of the republican party frankly
embraced the programme of Italian unity under Victor Emmanuel. They
foresaw that a repetition of the discordant action of 1848 would end in
the same way. Manin wrote to Lorenzo Valerio in September 1855: 'I, who am
a republican, plant the banner of <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_203"
id="Page_203">[Pg.203]</a></span> unification; let all who desire that
Italy should exist, rally round it, and Italy will exist.' The ex-dictator
of Venice was eking out a scanty livelihood by giving lessons in Paris; he
had only three years left to live, and was not destined to see his words
verified. But, poor and sick and obscure though he was, his support was
worth legions.</p>

<p>It was not the first time that Italian republicans had said to the
House of Savoy: If you will free Italy we are with you; but the
circumstances of the case were completely changed since Mazzini wrote in
somewhat the same language to Charles Albert a quarter of a century
before. Both times the proposal contained an ultimatum as well as an
offer, but Manin made it without second thoughts in the strongest hope
that the pact would be accepted and full of anticipatory joy at the
prospect of its success; while by the Genoese republican it was made in
mistrust and in the knowledge that were it accepted (which he did not
believe), its acceptance, though bringing with it for Italy a state of
things which he recognised as preferable to that which prevailed, would
bring to him personally nothing but disappointment and the forfeiture of
his dearest wishes.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say what were at this date Cavour's own private
sentiments about Italian unity. Though he once confessed that as a young
man he had fancied himself Prime Minister of Italy, whenever the subject
was now discussed he disclaimed any belief in the feasibility of uniting
all parts of the peninsula in one whole. He even called Manin 'a very good
man, but mad about Italian unification.' It wanted, in truth, the
prescience of the seer rather than the acumen of the politician to discern
the unity of Italy in 1855. All outward facts seemed more adverse to its
accomplishment than at any period since <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg.204]</a></span> 1815. Yet it was for Italy
that Cavour always pleaded; Italy, and not Piedmont or even Lombardy and
Venetia. He invariably asserted the right of his King to uphold the cause
of all the populations from the Alps to the Straits of Messina. If he
adopted the proverb 'Chi va piano va sano,' he kept in view the end of it,
'Chi va sano va lontano.' In short, if he did not believe in Italian
unity, he acted in the same way as he would have acted had he believed in
it.</p>

<p>It is evident that one thing he could not do. Whatever was in his
thoughts, unless he was prepared to retire into private life then and
there, he could not proclaim from the house-tops that he espoused the
artichoke theory attributed to Victor Amadeus. There were only too many
old diplomatists as it was, who sought to cripple Cavour's resources by
reviving that story. The time was not come when, without manifest damage
to the cause, he could plead guilty to the charge of preparing an Italian
crown for his Sovereign. 'The rule in politics,' Cavour once observed, 'is
to be as moderate in language as you are resolute in act.'</p>

<p>At the end of 1855, Victor Emmanuel, with Cavour and Massimo d'Azeglio,
paid a visit to the French and English Courts. He was received with more
marked cordiality at the English Court than at the French. No Prince
Charming, indeed, but the ideal of a bluff and burly Longobard chief, he
managed to win the good graces of his entertainers, even if they thought
him a trifle barbaric. The Duchess of Sutherland declared that of all the
knights of St George whom she had ever seen, he was the only one who would
have had the best of it in the fight with the dragon. The Queen rose at
four o'clock in the morning to take leave of him. Cavour was so much
struck by the <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">
[Pg.205]</a></span> interest which Her Majesty evinced in the efforts of
Piedmont for constitutional freedom, that he did not hesitate to call her
the best friend his country possessed in England.</p>

<p>It is not generally known, but it is quite true, that Victor Emmanuel
wished to contract a matrimonial alliance with the English royal family.
He did not take Cavour into his confidence, but a high English personage
was sounded on the matter, a hint being given to him to say nothing about
it to the Count. The lady who might have become Queen of Italy was the
Princess Mary of Cambridge. The negotiations were broken off because the
young Princess would not hear of any marriage which would have required
her living out of England.</p>

<p>The Congress which met in Paris in February 1856 for the conclusion of
the peace between the Allies and Russia was to have far more momentous
results for Italy than for the countries more immediately concerned in its
discussions, but, contrary to the general impression, it does not appear
that these results were anticipated by Cavour. He even said that it was
idle for Sardinia to send delegates to a congress in which they would be
treated like children. Cavour feared, perhaps, to lose the ground he had
gained in the previous year with Napoleon III., when the Emperor's rather
surprising question: 'Que peut-on faire pour l'Italie?' had suggested to
the Piedmontese statesman that definite scheme of a French alliance, which
henceforth he never let go. In any case, when D'Azeglio, who was appointed
Sardinian representative, refused at the last moment to undertake a charge
for which he knew he was not fitted, it was only at the urgent request of
the King that Cavour consented to take his place. When once in Paris,
however, he <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">
[Pg.206]</a></span> warmed to the work, finding an unexpectedly strong
ally in Lord Clarendon. He won what was considered in all Europe a great
diplomatic triumph, by getting a special sitting assigned to the
examination of Italian affairs, which had as little to do with the natural
work of the Congress as the affairs of China. The chief points discussed
at the secret sitting of the 8th of April were the foreign occupations in
Central Italy, and the state of the Roman and Neapolitian governments,
which was stigmatised by Lord Clarendon in terms much more severe than
Cavour himself thought it prudent to use. Count Buol, the chief Austrian
representative, grew very angry, and his opposition was successful in
reducing the sitting to a mere conversation; but what had been said had
been said, and Cavour prepared the way for his future policy by remarking
to everyone: 'You see that diplomacy can do nothing for us; the question
needs another solution.' Lord Clarendon's vigorous support made him think
for a moment that England might take an active part in that other
solution, and with this idea in his mind he hurried over the Channel to
see Lord Palmerston, but he left England convinced that nothing more than
moral assistance was ever to be expected from that quarter. The Marquis
Emmanuel d'Azeglio, who for many years represented Sardinia, and
afterwards Italy, at the Court of St James, has placed it on record that
the English Premier repeatedly assured him that an armed intervention on
behalf of Italian freedom would have been much to his taste, but that the
country would not have been with him. It is certain that Cavour would have
preferred an English to a French alliance; as it was not to be had, he
reposed his sole hopes in the Emperor Napoleon, who had not the French
people <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">
[Pg.207]</a></span> really more with him in this matter than Lord
Palmerston had the English&mdash;nay, he had them less with him, for in
England there would have been a party of Italian sympathisers favourable
to the war, and in France, there was no one except Prince Napoleon and the
workmen of Paris. But the French Emperor was a despotic sovereign, and not
the Prime Minister of a self-governing country. After all, some good may
come out of despotism.</p>

<p>Upon Cavour's return to Turin, he received not only the approval of the
King and Parliament, but also congratulations from all parts of Italy. His
position had gained immensely in strength, both at home and abroad. Yet
the power of the Clerical party in Piedmont was still such that, in the
elections of 1857&mdash;the first that had taken place since the
legislation affecting the Church&mdash;they obtained seventy seats out of
a total of two hundred. Cavour did not conceal his alarm. What if eight
years' labour were thrown away, and the movement of the State turned
backward? 'Never,' he said, 'would he advise a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat,</i>
nor would his master resort to one; but if the King abdicated, what then?'
Victor Emmanuel said to his Prime Minister: 'Let us do our duty; stand
firm, and we shall see!' He often declared that, sooner than beat a
retreat from the path he had entered on, he would go to America and become
plain <i>Mons&ugrave; Savoia</i>; but he never lost faith in the
predominating patriotism and good sense of his subjects; and at this time,
as at others, he proved to be right. The crisis was surmounted. On the one
hand, some elections were invalidated where the priests had exercised
undue influence; and, on the other, Rattazzi, who was especially obnoxious
to the Clerical party, retired from office. Cavour thus found himself
still able to command the Chamber.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h4>PREMONITIONS OF THE STORM</h4>

<h5>1857-1858</h5>

<h5>Pisacane's Landing&mdash;Orsini's Attempt&mdash;The Compact of
Plombi&egrave;res&mdash;Cavour's Triumph.</h5>

<br />
<p>In spite of the accusation of favouring political assassination which
was frequently launched against the Italian secret societies, only one of
the faithless Italian princes came to a violent death, and his murder had
no connection with politics. Charles III., Duke of Parma, was mortally
stabbed in March 1854; some said that the assassin was a groom whom he had
struck with a riding-whip; others, that he was the father or brother of
one of the victims of the Duke's dissolute habits. The Duchess, a daughter
of the Duke de Berry, assumed the Regency on behalf of her son, who was a
child. She began by initiating many reforms; but a street disturbance in
July gave Austria the desired excuse for meddling in the government, when
all progress was, of course, arrested.</p>

<p>In December 1856, a soldier named Ageslao Milano attempted to
assassinate the King of the Two Sicilies at a review. He belonged to no
sect, but he had long premeditated the act. A few days later an earthquake
occurred in the kingdom of Naples, by which over ten thousand persons lost
their lives. Ferdinand II. grew morose, and shut <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg.209]</a></span> himself up in the royal
palace of Caserta. The constant lectures of France and England annoyed him
without persuading him to take the means to put a stop to them. Not till
1859 did he open the doors of the prisons in which Poerio, Settembrini and
their companions were confined. Many plans were made, meanwhile, for their
liberation, and English friends even provided a ship by which they were to
escape; but the ship foundered: perhaps fortunately, as Garibaldi, with
characteristic disinterestedness, had agreed to direct the enterprise,
which could not have been otherwise than perilous, and was not unlikely to
end in the loss of all concerned.</p>

<p>Disaster attended Baron Bentivegna's attempt at a rising at Taormina in
1856, and Carlo Pisacane's landing at Sapri in the summer of the following
year had no better result. Pisacane, a son of the Duke Gennaro di San
Giovanni of Naples, had fought in the defence of Rome and was a firm
adherent of Mazzini, in conjunction with whom he planned his unlucky
venture. Pisacane watched the growing ascendency of Piedmont with sorrow;
he was one of the few, if not the only one of his party to say that he
would as soon have the dominion of Austria as that of the House of Savoy.
But if he was an extremist in politics, none the less he was a patriot,
who took his life in his hands and offered it up to his country in the
spirit of the noblest devotion. He had the slenderest hope of success, but
he believed that only by such failures could the people be roused from
their apathy. 'For me,' he wrote, 'it will be victory even if I die on the
scaffold. This is all I can do, and this I do; the rest depends on the
country, not on me. I have only my affections and my life to give, and I
give them without hesitation.'</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">
[Pg.210]</a></span> With the young Baron Nicotera and twenty-three others,
Pisacane embarked on the <i>Cagliari</i>, a steamer belonging to a
Sardinian mercantile line, which was bound for Tunis. When at sea, the
captain was frightened into obedience, and the ship's course was directed
to the isle of Ponza, where several hundred prisoners, mostly political,
were undergoing their sentences. The guards made little resistance, and
Pisacane opened the prisons, inviting who would to follow him. The first
plan had been to make a descent on San Stefano, the island where
Settembrini was imprisoned, but that good citizen had refused to admit the
liberation of the non-political prisoners, which was an unavoidable
feature in the scheme. With the addition of about three hundred men,
Pisacane left Ponza for the mainland and disembarked near the village of
Sapri, in the province of Salerno. From information received, he imagined
that a revolutionary movement was on the point of breaking out in that
district. Nothing could be further from the fact. The country people did
all the harm they could to the band, which, after making a brave stand
against the local militia, was cut to pieces by the royal troops. Pisacane
fell fighting; those who were not killed were taken, and amongst these was
Nicotera, who was kept in prison till set free by Garibaldi.</p>

<p>The <i>Cagliari</i> was captured and detained with its crew. As two of
the seamen were British subjects, the English Government joined Sardinia
in demanding its restitution, which, after long delays, was conceded.</p>

<p>In 1857, the Emperor of Austria relieved Field-Marshal Radetsky, then
in his ninety-third year, of the burden of office. He was given the right
of living in any of the royal palaces, even in the Emperor's own residence
at Vienna, but he preferred to spend the one remaining year <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg.211]</a></span> of his life
in Italy. At the same time, the Archduke Maximilian was appointed Viceroy
of Lombardy and Venetia. A more naturally amiable and cultivated Prince
never had the evil fate forced upon him of attempting impossible tasks.
Just married to the lovely Princess Charlotte of Belgium, he came to Italy
radiant with happiness, and wishing to make everyone as happy as he was
himself. Not even the chilling welcome he received damped his enthusiasm,
for he thought the aversion of the population depended on undoubted
wrongs, which it was his full intention to redress. He was to learn two
things; firstly, that the day of reconciliation was past: there were too
many ghosts between the Lombards and Venetians, and the House of Hapsburg.
Secondly, that an unseen hand beyond the Brenner would diligently thwart
each one of his benevolent designs. The system was, and was to remain,
unchanged. It was not carried out quite as it was carried out in the first
years after 1849. The exiles were allowed to return and the sequestrations
were revoked. It should be said, because it shows the one white spot in
Austrian despotism, its civil administration, that on resuming their
rights of ownership the proprietors found that their estates had not been
badly managed. But the depressing and deadening influence of an
anti-national rule continued unabated. Lombardy and Venetia were governed
not from Milan, but from Vienna. Very small were the crumbs which the
Viceroy obtained, though he went on a journey to Austria expressly to
plead for concessions. It is sad to think what an enlightened heir to the
great Austrian empire was lost, when Napoleon III. and his own family sent
Maximilian of Hapsburg to Queretaro.</p>

<p>While Cavour had come to the conclusion that the aid which he believed
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg.212]</a></span>
essential for the expulsion of the Austrians could only come from the
French Emperor, this sovereign was regarded by a not inconsiderable party
of Italians as the greatest, if not the sole, obstacle to their
liberation. All those, in particular, who came in contact with the French
exiles, were impressed by them with the notion that France, the real
France, was only waiting for the disappearance of the Man of December to
throw herself into their arms. Among the Italians who held these opinions,
there were a few with whom it became a fixed idea that the greatest
service they could render their country was the removal of Napoleon from
the political scene. They conceived and nourished the thought
independently of one another; they belonged to no league, but for that
reason they were the more dangerous; somewhere or other there was always
someone planning to put an end to the Emperor's life. It is not worth
while to pause to discuss the ethics of political assassination;
civilisation has decided against it, and history proves its usual failure
to promote the desired object. What benefit did the Confederate cause
derive from the assassination of the good President Lincoln, or the cause
of Russian liberty from that of Alexander II.? What will Anarchy gain by
the murder of Carnot? It is certain, however, that never were men more
convinced that they were executing a wild kind of justice than were the
men who plotted against Napoleon III. They looked upon him as one of
themselves who had turned traitor. There is a great probability that, in
his early days when he was playing at conspiracy in Italy, he was actually
enrolled as a Carbonaro. At all events, he had conspired for Italian
freedom, and afterwards, to serve his own selfish interests, he
extinguished it in Rome. The temporal power of the Pope was kept alive
through him. <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">
[Pg.213]</a></span></p>

<p>A true account of the attempts on Napoleon's life will never be
written, because the only persons who were able and willing to throw light
on the subject, ex-police agents and their kind, are authorities whose
word is worth a very limited acceptance. It is pretty sure that there were
more plots than the public ever knew of, and that in some cases the
plotters were disposed of summarily. Most of them were poor, ignorant
creatures, but in January 1858 an attempt was made by a man of an entirely
different stamp, Felice Orsini.</p>

<p>Born at Meldola in Romagna in 1819, he was of the true Romagnol type in
mind and body; daring, resourceful, intolerant of control. From his
earliest youth all his actions had but one object, the liberation of his
country. His youthful brain was enflamed by Alfieri and Foscolo, who
remained his favourite authors. He hated Austria well, and he hated the
Papal government as no one but one of its own subjects could hate it.
'When the French landed in Italy' (he told his judges) 'it was hoped that
they were come as friends, but they proved the worst of enemies. For a
time they were repulsed, then they resumed the cloak of friendship, but
only to wait for reinforcements. When these arrived they returned to the
assault, a thousand against ten, and we were judicially assassinated.' A
succinct and true narrative. During the republic Orsini was sent to
Ancona, where anarchy had broken out; by vigorous measures he restored
perfect order. In 1854 he was arrested in Hungary and condemned to death,
but he escaped from Mantua under romantic circumstances and reached
England, where the story of his audacious flight won for him many
sympathisers. He was often seen in society. On one occasion he was asked
to meet Prince Lucien Buonaparte. Orsini knew Mazzini, but he was
impatient of his <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">
[Pg.214]</a></span> mystical leanings, and he disapproved of such
enterprises as Pisacane's, by which, as he thought, twenty or thirty men
were sacrificed here or there without anything coming of it. He finally
repudiated Mazzini's leadership, and in March 1857 he wrote to Cavour,
asking him for a passport to return to Italy, and placing at the disposal
of the Sardinian government 'the courage and energy which it had pleased
God to give him,' provided that government left wavering behind, and
showed its unmistakable will to achieve the independence of Italy. Cavour
sent no reply, 'because,' he said later, 'the letter was noble and
energetic, and I should have had to pay Orsini compliments which I did not
deem fitting. 'Unlike Victor Emmanuel, who in after years carried on
regular negotiations with Mazzini, Cavour, while ready to make an alliance
with the Radicals in the Chamber, was extremely loth to have anything to
do with actual revolutionists. His not answering Orsini's letter certainly
led up to the attempt of the 14th of January 1858.</p>

<p>Having quarrelled with Mazzini, and receiving no encouragement from
Cavour, Orsini evolved the plan which on that day he endeavoured to put
into execution. He would have preferred to act alone, but since that was
impossible, he sought and found without much difficulty two or three
accomplices. One of these, Pieri, a teacher of languages, was arrested by
the police, who recognised him as an old conspirator, before he threw the
bomb which he was carrying. The other bombs were thrown just as the
carriage containing the Imperial party drove up to the opera house. A
number of people in the street were killed or injured, but the Emperor and
Empress escaped unhurt. When they entered the theatre the Rutli scene of
the conspirators in <i>Guillaume Tell</i> was being performed. Not a
breath of applause greeted them, though <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg.215]</a></span> everyone knew what had
happened. Napoleon III. had a striking proof of how little hold he
possessed on the affections of his subjects.</p>

<p>When at his trial Orsini was asked what he expected would happen if he
had succeeded in killing the Emperor he answered: 'We were convinced that
the surest way of making a revolution in Italy was to excite one in
France, and that the surest way of making a revolution in France was to
kill the Emperor.' There is a good deal of curious evidence to show that
very elaborate preparations had been made for a revolution in Paris. The
French police had orders, however, to keep all this aspect of the affair
out of sight. It was to be made to appear the isolated act of a misguided
Italian patriot. 'The world possesses an Orsini legend,' writes the late
Duke of Saxe-Coburg, who was present at the event, having been invited to
join the Emperor at the opera, 'which is quite at variance with facts.'
The duke clearly thinks that the conviction of the instability of his
throne which was brought home to the Emperor on this occasion, was one of
the causes which decided him to try the diversion of public opinion into
other channels by means of a foreign war.</p>

<p>Everything was done to make Orsini a hero in the eyes of the French
public, and to excite sympathy in his cause. Jules Favre by his eloquent
defence in which he pleaded not for the life, but for the honour of his
client, and still more Orsini's own letter to the Emperor, produced a
powerful impression; there was a dramatic interest in the man who,
disdaining to crave clemency for himself, tried a last supreme effort in
the service of the country he had loved too well. 'Deliver my fatherland,
and the blessings of twenty-five million citizens will be with you.' So
concluded the letter in which Orsini <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg.216]</a></span> told Napoleon, that till
Italy was free there would be no peace for Europe&mdash;nor for him. It
was whispered that the Emperor had a secret interview with the condemned
man at the Mazas prison; at any rate, when Orsini mounted the scaffold, he
was borne up, not only by his invincible courage, but by the strongest
hope, if not the certainty that his last prayer would have only a short
time to wait for fulfilment.</p>

<p>Though persons who were able to read the signs of the times no longer
doubted that Napoleon had resolved to solve the Italian question by force
of arms, it suited his purpose to occupy the public mind for the moment
with the furious agitation against England and Piedmont as 'dens of
assassins,' which led to the fall of the Palmerston administration on the
Conspiracy Bill, and seemed to almost place in jeopardy the throne of
Victor Emmanuel. Napoleon sent the King of Sardinia demands so sweeping in
language so threatening, that the old Savoy blood was fired, and Victor
Emmanuel returned the answer: 'Tell the Emperor in whatever terms you
think best that this is not the way to treat a faithful ally; that I have
never tolerated violence from anyone; that I follow the path of unstained
honour, and for that honour I am only answerable to God and to my people.
That we have carried our head high for 850 years, and no one will make me
lower it; and that, nevertheless, I desire nothing better than to remain
his friend.' This reply was benevolently received; Cavour passed through
the Chambers a bill which, though not corresponding to the extravagant
pretensions of the French Government, gave reasonable security against the
concoction of plots of a criminal nature; Napoleon expressed himself
satisfied, and three months after, despatched Dr Conneau to Turin, to
mention, quite by the way, to the Piedmontese minister, that <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg.217]</a></span> he would be
glad to have a conversation with him on Italian affairs. This was the
preliminary of the interview of Plombi&egrave;res.</p>

<p>Plombi&egrave;res is a watering-place in the Vosges, which became
famous on the 20th of July 1858, the day on which Napoleon III. and Cavour
entered into the compact that laid down the conditions of the Italian war.
The Emperor was to bring 200,000 men into Italy, and the King of Sardinia
undertook to furnish 100,000. The Austrians were to be expelled from
Italy. The kingdom of Upper Italy would embrace the Legations and the
Marches then under the Pope. Savoy would be ceded to France. The marriage
of the Emperor's cousin with the Princess Clotilde was not made a
condition of the war, and only in case it had been made a condition, was
Cavour empowered to agree to it. He, therefore, left it uncertain; but he
came away from Plombi&egrave;res convinced that nearly everything depended
upon its happening. Napoleon was beyond measure anxious for a marriage
which would ally him with one of the oldest reigning families in Europe.
It would be a fatal mistake, Cavour thought, to join the Emperor, and at
the same time, to offend him in a way which he would never forget.
Directly after the interview, he wrote a long letter to the King to
persuade him to yield the point. After all, where would the Princess find
a more promising match? Was it easy to provide husbands for princesses?
Were not they generally extremely unhappy in marriage? What had happened
to the King's four aunts, all charming princesses, who had married the
Duke of Modena, the Duke of Lucca, the Emperor Ferdinand of Austria, and
the King of Naples? Had they been happy? Prince Napoleon could not be so
very bad, as he was known to have hurried to Cannes to pay a last visit to
a woman whom he had loved, a great actress, then upon her <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg.218]</a></span> deathbed.
This reminiscence was a singular one to evoke under the circumstances, but
Cavour was not an Englishman, and he was not impressed by the propriety of
drawing a veil over facts which everyone knew.</p>

<p>The King's instinct told him that his young daughter, pious and simple
and destitute even of that seasoning of vanity which is so good and
necessary a thing in a woman, but proud at heart like all her race, would
derive no compensation from the outward brilliancy of the Imperial Court
for the absence of domestic joy which would be her wedded lot unless a
surprising change came over the bridegroom. When, however, he was
persuaded of the importance, or rather, of the essential character of the
concession, he said to Cavour: 'I am making a great sacrifice, but I yield
to your arguments. Still my consent is subordinate to the freely given
consent of my daughter.' The matter was referred to the Princess, who
answered: 'It is the wish of my father; therefore this marriage will be
useful to my family and my country, and I accept.' An answer worthy of one
who, twelve years later, when the members of the Imperial House were
flying, remained quietly in Paris, saying: 'Savoy and fear are not
acquainted.'</p>

<p>The marriage was celebrated at Turin in January. The King made a
present to Cavour, as a souvenir of the event, of a ring representing two
heartseases. In thanking him, the minister said: 'Your Majesty knows that
I shall never marry.' 'I know,' replied the King; 'your bride is the
country.'</p>

<p>Though warlike rumours circulated off and on, the secret of the
understanding arrived at in the Plombi&egrave;res interview was well
preserved, and the words spoken by Napoleon to the Austrian Ambassador at
the New Year's Day reception fell on Europe with the effect of a <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg.219]</a></span>
bombshell. Turning to Baron Hubner, he said: 'Je regrette que les
relations entre nous soient si mauvaises; d&icirc;tes cependant &agrave;
votre souverain que mes sentiments pour lui ne sont pas
chang&eacute;s.'</p>

<p>Even Cavour was startled. Probably till that moment he had never felt
sure that Napoleon would not after all throw the Italian cause to the
winds. The Emperor's invariable method in dealing with men was to mystify
them. He was pleased to pose as a faithful ally, but human intellect was
insufficient to fathom what he meant. On this system, skilfully pursued,
was reared the whole fabric of Louis Napoleon's reputation for being a
profound politician. Bearing the fact in mind, we can easily see why that
reputation crumbled away almost entirely when the present became the past.
There are few cases in which there is more disagreement between the
judgment of contemporaries and that of immediate posterity than the case
of the French Emperor.</p>

<p>The least surprised, and, among Italians, the most dissatisfied at the
New Year's Day pronouncement was Mazzini, who when he read it in the <i>
Times</i> next morning felt that the Napoleonic war closed the heroic
period of Italian Liberation. To men like Mazzini failure is apt to seem
more heroic than success, and the war of 1859 did close the period of
failure. The justification for calling in foreign arms could only be in
necessity, and Mazzini denied the necessity. Charles Albert denied it in
1848 with no less confident a voice. Then, indeed, there did appear a
chance of Italy making herself, but was there the slightest prospect,
eleven years later, of that chance being repeated? Each student of history
may answer for himself. What is plain is, that France and Sardinia <i>
together</i> were to find it an exceedingly hard task even to drive the
Austrians out of Lombardy.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">
[Pg.220]</a></span> The unconquerable dislike of men of principle, like
Mazzini, to joining hands with the author of the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>
was perfectly explicable. There were doubtless some sincere Bulgarian
patriots who disliked joining hands with the Autocrat of all the Russias.
The gift of freedom from a despot means a long list of evils. Mazzini
grasped the maleficent influence which Napoleon III. would be in a
position to exercise over the young state; he knew, moreover, when only
two or three other persons in Europe knew it, that the bargain of
Plombi&egrave;res was on the principle of give-and-take. How Mazzini was
for many years better informed than any cabinet in Europe, remains a
secret. 'I know positively,' he wrote on the 4th of January 1859, 'that
the idea of the war is only to hand over a zone of Lombardy to Piedmont,
and the cession of Savoy and Nice to France: the peace, upon the offer of
which they count, would abandon the whole of Venetia to Austria.' A month
before this he had disclosed what was certainly true, namely, that
Napoleon wanted to place a Murat on the throne of Naples, and to
substitute Prince Napoleon for the Grand Duke of Tuscany. The point that
is doubtful in the above revelation is the statement that the Emperor
never meant to emancipate Venetia. The probabilities are against this. He
may, however, have questioned all along whether his troops, with those of
the King of Sardinia, would display a superiority over the Austrian forces
sufficiently incontestable for him to risk taking them into the mouse-trap
of the Quadrilateral. In this one thing Napoleon was amply
justified&mdash;in having no sort of desire to take a beaten army back to
Paris.</p>

<p>Mazzini, with the more extreme members of the Party of Action
(including Crispi), issued a protest against the Napoleonic war, with
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg.221]</a></span>
the advice to have nothing to do with it or its authors. But Italy thought
otherwise, and Garibaldi, the man who of all others most nearly
represented the heart of Italy, rejoiced and was glad. He did not believe
a word about the proposed cession of Savoy and Nice; no one did, except
Mazzini and his few disciples. What he saw was, that a great step towards
independence was about to be taken. In 1856, he not only adhered to
Manin's call to all Italians to rally round the house of Savoy, but went
further than Manin in accepting unconditionally what he called the 'Savoy
Dictatorship,' to which he left full liberty of choice in the matter of
ways and means. He did justice then to Cavour's patriotism: it was only
after the sacrifice of Nice that a feeling of bitter antagonism grew up in
him for the man who he thought had deceived Italy and himself. In December
1858, on a summons from Cavour, he left Caprera (the island which he had
bought with a little inheritance falling to him on the death of his
brother) and proceeded to Turin, where he was informed of a plan for a
rising in Massa and Carrara, which was originally intended to be the
signal of the war. The plan was given up, but in March 1859, Garibaldi was
told by Victor Emmanuel in person of the imminence of war, and was invited
to take part in it as commander of an auxiliary corps of volunteers which
took the name of 'Cacciatori delle Alpi.' In this way, all his own
followers, not only those in arms, but the great mass of the people which
was obedient to his lead, became enrolled in the service of the Sardinian
monarchy; a fact of capital importance in the future development of
affairs. Without it, the Italian kingdom could not have been formed. And
this fact was due to Cavour, who had to fight the arrayed strength of the
old, narrow, military caste at Turin, which <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg.222]</a></span> had succeeded in getting
Garibaldi's sword refused in 1848, and wished for nothing in the world
more than to get it refused in 1859. Near the end of his life, Cavour said
in the Chamber that the difficulties he encountered in inducing the
Sardinian War Office to sanction the appointment were all but
insurmountable. Unfortunately, the jealousy of the heads of the regular
army for the revolutionary captain never ceased. As for Cavour, even when
he opposed Garibaldi politically, he always strove to have the highest
personal honour paid to the man of whom he once wrote 'that he had
rendered Italy the greatest service it was possible to render her.'</p>

<p>True to his <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of mystification, one week after the shot
fired on the 1st of January, Napoleon inserted an official statement in
the <i>Moniteur</i> to the effect that, although public opinion had been
agitated by alarming rumours, there was nothing in the foreign relations
of France to justify the fears these rumours tended to create. He
continued on this tack, with more or less consistency, to the very verge
of the outbreak of hostilities. 'The Empire was peace,' as it was always
announced to be in the intervals when it was not war; there was no more
harmless dove in Europe than the person enthroned in the Tuileries. These
assurances were given more credence than they deserved by the Conservative
Cabinet then in power in England, and the British ministers believed to
the last that war would be averted, to which end they strained every
nerve. Besides the wish felt by every English government to preserve
European peace, there was at this juncture, not only in the Cabinet, but
in the country, so much fear of Napoleon's ambition and restlessness, that
for the time being, <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_223" id=
"Page_223">[Pg.223]</a></span> sympathy with Italy was relegated to a
second place.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was no want of plainness in the language employed in
Piedmont. In opening the second session of the sixth Sardinian Parliament,
Victor Emmanuel pronounced, on 10th January, the historic phrase declaring
that he could not remain insensible to the cry of grief, <i>il grido di
dolore</i>, that reached him from all parts of Italy. Every corner of the
fair country where the <i>Si</i> sounds was electrified. The words, as has
since become known, were introduced into the speech by the King himself.
As Cavour had foreseen, Austria played into his hands. To Lord
Malmesbury's appeal to evacuate the Roman Legations, and to use Austrian
influence with the Italian princes in procuring the concession of
necessary reforms, Count Buol replied in terms that were the reverse of
obliging: 'We do not mean to abdicate our right of intervention, and if we
are called upon to help the Italian sovereigns with our arms, we shall do
so. We shall not recommend their governments to undertake any reforms.
France plays the part of protectress of nationalities; we are, and shall
be, protectors of dynastic rights.' Finally, England proposed a congress
with a view to general disarmament. Piedmont, counting on the madness of
her adversary, risked agreement with this plan. Austria gave a peremptory
refusal to have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>Cavour now asked Parliament to vote a war loan of &pound;2,000,000,
which was passed by a majority of 81 out of 151 votes. No foreign banker
would undertake to negotiate the loan, but it was twice covered by Italian
buyers, nearly all small capitalists, who put their money into it as a
patriotic duty. Amongst the few deputies who opposed the loan was the old
apostle of retrogression, Count Solaro della Margherita, who raised his
solitary voice against the tide of revolution; and the Savoyard the
Marquis Costa de Beauregard whose speech was pathetic <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg.224]</a></span> from the
melancholy foreboding which pervaded it that the making of Italy meant the
unmaking of Savoy. Speaking in the name of his fellow-countrymen, the
Marquis reconfirmed the profound love of Savoy for her Royal House and her
total lack of solidarity with the aspirations of Italy. With time the
Savoyards might have learnt to be Italians as their king had learnt to be
an Italian king. Or they might not. Possibly the best solution would have
been to join Savoy to the Swiss Confederation, though the martial
instincts of the race were not favourable to their Conversion into
peaceful Helvetic citizens. From one point of view, that of military
defence, the retention of the province was of infinitely more moment to
the future Italy than to little Piedmont. Sardinia could keep the peace
with France for an indefinite period; Italy cannot. What is true of Savoy
is far more true of Nice. To have it in foreign keeping is to have a very
partially reformed burglar inside your house.</p>

<p>'Notre roi,' said an old ragged fisherman of the Lac de Bourget to the
writer of this book,&mdash;'Notre roi nous a vendus.' Not willingly did
Victor Emmanuel incur that charge, in which the rebound from love to hate
was so clearly heard; not willingly did he give up Maurienne, cradle of
his race, Hautecombe, grave of his fathers. It was the greatest sacrifice,
he said, that Italy could have asked of him. Nor is there any reason to
doubt his word. But it is incorrect to suppose, as many have supposed,
that Cavour promised at Plombi&egrave;res to give up Savoy (Nice he did
not promise) without the King's knowledge. Before he went there, he had
brought Victor Emmanuel over to his own belief, justified or not, that
without a bait Napoleon could not be got to <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg.225]</a></span> move. Directly after the
interview, he wrote a full account of it to the King, in which he said:
'When the future fate of Italy was arranged, the Emperor asked me what
France would have, and if your Majesty would cede Savoy and the county of
Nice?' To which Cavour answered 'Yes' as to Savoy, but objected that Nice
was essentially Italian. The Emperor twirled his moustache several times,
and only said that these were secondary questions, about which there would
be time to think later.</p>

<p>Austria was always appealing to the right of treaties and the right of
nations; not, as it happened, with much reason, for she had ridden or
tried to ride rough-shod through as many treaties and through quite as
many rights as most European Powers. In 1816 she was so determined to
possess herself of Alessandria and the Upper Novarese that Lord
Castlereagh advised Piedmont to join the Austrian Confederation, as then
and only then the Emperor might withdraw his pretensions to this large
slice of territory of a Prince with whom he was at peace. If he did
withdraw them, it was not from respect for the treaties which, a year
before, had confirmed the King of Sardinia's rights as an independent
sovereign, but from respect for the untoward results to himself which he
was afraid, on reflection, might arise from enforcing his claims with the
bayonet. But people forget; and it was of vital consequence that virtuous
Austria should figure in the coming conflict not as the victim of
aggression but as the aggressor. On all sides it was said that the
Austrian Government would never commit an error of such magnitude; only
Cavour thought the contrary. 'I shall <i>force</i> her to declare war
against us,' he told Mr Odo Russell in December 1858. When asked by the
incredulous diplomatist at what date he expected to <span class="newpage">
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg.226]</a></span> perform so great a
feat, Cavour quietly answered: 'In the first week of May.' War was
actually declared a few days sooner.</p>

<p>For months Austria had been pouring troops into Italy, a large portion
of which were massed on the frontier line of the Ticino. Who shall count
the number of the men brought to fight and die in the Italian plains
between 1848 and 1866 to sustain for that short time the weight of a
condemned despotism? The supply was inexhaustible; they came from the
Hungarian steppes, from the green valleys of Styria, from the mountains of
Tyrol, from the woodlands of the Banat and of Bohemia; a blind million
battling for a chimera. They came, and how many did not return?</p>

<p>Austria's final refusal to adhere to the Congress scheme meant, of
course, war, and Cavour called the Chamber and demanded a vote conferring
upon Government the power to take such prompt measures as the situation
required. 'We trust,' he said, 'that the Chamber will not hesitate to
sanction the proposal to invest the King with plenary powers. Who could be
a better guardian of our liberty? Who more worthy of the faith of the
nation? He it is whose name a ten years' reign had made synonymous with
honour and loyalty; who has always held high the tricolor standard of
Italy, who now prepares to unsheath his sword for freedom and
independence.'</p>

<p>When Cavour walked out of the Chamber after the vote had been taken, he
said: 'I am leaving the last sitting of the Piedmontese Parliament, the
next will be that of the Kingdom of Italy.' At that moment, if ever in his
career, the great minister who had fought so long a fight against
incalculable obstacles learnt what it is to taste the sweetness of
triumph.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h4>THE WAR FOR LOMBARDY</h4>

<h5>1859</h5>

<h5>Austria declares War&mdash;Montebello&mdash;Garibaldi's
Campaign&mdash;Palestro&mdash;Magenta&mdash;The Allies enter
Milan&mdash;Ricasoli saves Italian Unity&mdash;Accession of Francis
II.&mdash;Solferino&mdash;The Armistice of Villafranca.</h5>

<br />
<p>Baron von Kellersperg reached Turin on the 23rd of April, bringing with
him the Austrian ultimatum: 'Disarmament within three days, or war.'
Cavour read the document, and then drew his watch out of his pocket. It
was half-past five in the afternoon. At the same hour on the 26th, he gave
Baron von Kellersperg the answer: 'Sardinia having accepted the principle
of a general disarmament, as formulated by England, with the adhesion of
France, Prussia and Russia, the Sardinian Government has no other
explanation to make.' The retort was justified. Austria, which now
required Sardinia to disarm, had refused to disarm herself. She must take
the consequences.</p>

<p>The British Government made a last desperate effort to maintain peace,
and the Austrians always said that this was their ruin, as it delayed the
invasion of Piedmont for a week. On the 29th appeared the Emperor Francis
Joseph's Declaration of War, and on the same day the first Austrian
columns crossed the Ticino. The Austrian commander-in-chief was Count
Gyulai, who was in high favour with the aristocratic party, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg.228]</a></span> by which
his appointment was suggested to, if not forced upon, the Emperor. The
latter, not altogether easy in his mind about Gyulai's capabilities,
commissioned General Hess, in whom he placed full confidence, to keep his
eye on him. Hess could not, however, do much more than take notes of one
of the most remarkable and providential series of blunders ever committed
by the commander of an army.</p>

<p>In spite of the delay which the Austrians ascribed to the English peace
negotiations, there was time for them to destroy the Sardinian army before
the French came up. Gyulai had 100,000 men in the theatre of war, a number
increased up to 200,000 during the campaign. Both Sardinia and her ally
mustered much fewer men than were spoken of at Plombi&egrave;res. The
Piedmontese could dispose of 56,000 infantry, formed in five divisions,
one division of cavalry numbering 4,000, and one brigade of volunteers, to
which the name was given of 'Cacciatori delle Alpi.' The enrolment of
these was stopped when it had reached the small figure of 4,500 men, a
figure that looks out of all proportion with the brilliant part they
played. The same influences which cut short the enrolment prevented Cavour
from keeping his distinct promise to give Garibaldi, now invested with the
official rank of major-general, 10,000 regulars, with a battery and a
troop of horse.</p>

<p>The French army consisted of 128,000 men, including about 10,000
cavalry. The Emperor's Government had notified beforehand to Vienna that
the passage of the Ticino by the Austrian troops would be considered
equivalent to a declaration of war, and accordingly, on the 29th of April,
diplomatic relations between the two Powers were broken off. The French
forces had been really on the move for more than a week&mdash;ever since,
in fact, by what the Marquis of Normanby called 'an <span class="newpage">
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg.229]</a></span> unpardonable breach
of confidence,' the intention of Austria to invade Sardinia was
communicated to Paris. The mobilisation was conducted with rapidity; in
spite of the snow, which lay deep on the Mont Cenis, the first corps,
under Marshal Baraguay d'Hilliers, made a swift march over the Alps, and
the foremost division entered Turin on the 30th of April. The troops of
Canrobert and Niel, who commanded the third and fourth corps, were sent by
Toulon and Marseilles, while the generals themselves went on to Turin in
advance. MacMahon's corps, which was the second, was on its way from
Algiers. The fifth corps, under the command of Prince Napoleon, was
despatched at a later date to Tuscany, where it was kept in a state of
inactivity, which suggested rather a political than a military mission.
General Regnault de Saint-Jean d'Ang&eacute;ly commanded the Imperial
Guard. Napoleon III assumed the supreme command of the allied armies, with
General Vaillant as head of the staff.</p>

<p>The condition of neither French nor Austrian army was satisfactory. The
former had more modern arms and a greater proportion of old soldiers, but
it was generally thought that the French cavalry, so far superior to the
Prussian in the war of 1870, was inferior to the Austrian in 1859. The
commissariat and ambulance arrangements of the French were disgraceful,
though they had this advantage, that when there was food to be had the
soldiers were allowed to eat it, while the Austrians were limited to
half-a-pound of beef a day, and were only allowed to cook once in the
twenty-four hours, which led to their having constantly to fight fasting.
In point of discipline, they were probably superior to the French, who
fought, however, and this should always be remembered of them in Italy,
with the best will in the <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_230" id=
"Page_230">[Pg.230]</a></span> world. They carried about their pet monkeys
and dogs, and were always good-humoured and in good spirits, even when
wounded. What would have been the effect on them of even a single defeat
is a question which it is useless to discuss.</p>

<p>In Napoleon's proclamation to the French people it was stated that the
scope of the war was to give Italy to herself, not to make her change
masters; the recompense of France would be to have upon her frontiers a
friendly people which owed its independence to her. As things stood there
were but two alternatives: Austria supreme as far as the Alps, or Italy
free to the Adriatic. On the 12th of May, the Imperial yacht, the <i>Reine
Hortense</i>, steamed into the harbour of Genoa with the Emperor on board.
A splendid reception awaited him, and amongst the first to greet him was
Cavour. 'You may well rejoice,' said Napoleon, as he embraced the
Sardinian statesman, 'for your plans are being realised.'</p>

<p>Gyulai, who had insisted on invading Piedmont, contrary to the opinion
of Hess (who counselled waiting for reinforcements on the left bank of the
Mincio), wasted his time after crossing the Ticino in making plans and
changing them while he could unquestionably have thrown himself on Turin
had he possessed more resolution, and this was the only operation that
could have justified the initial folly of the invasion. The taking of the
capital might not have altered the fortunes of the war, but it would have
had all the appearance of a triumph, and would have raised the <i>
moral</i> of the Austrian soldiers. The allies had time to concentrate
their forces near Tortona, and it was left to them to assume the
offensive. The Austrians retired towards the Apennines, but made a forward
movement on the 20th of May with the object of seizing <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg.231]</a></span> the heights
of Casteggio which command the road to Piacenza; they were met by the
allies at the village of Montebello where Marshal Lannes obtained a
victory in 1800. The allies were completely successful in this first
battle, the honours of the day falling to the Sardinian cavalry, which
showed great gallantry. The Austrian forces were considerably superior in
strength.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time as the engagement of Montebello, Garibaldi with
his diminutive army (which through the weeding-out of men unfit for
service was reduced to about 3,500 before it took the field), crossed the
Lago Maggiore, and advanced boldly into the heart of the enemy's country.
The volunteers had no artillery, and by way of cavalry only some forty or
fifty were mounted on their own horses and dignified with the name of
'guides.' They were badly armed and worse equipped; the only good thing
they had was an excellent ambulance organised by Dr Bertani, Garibaldi's
surgeon-general from Roman days downwards. But they formed a picturesque
sight as they marched along gaily to the everlasting song, 'Addio, mia
bella, addio'; and a physiognomist would have been struck by their
intelligent and often distinguished faces: nobles and poets, budding
doctors and lawyers, bristled in the ranks, while the officers were the
still young veterans of 1848-1849: Cosenz, hero of Venice; Medici, the
defender of the Vascello; Bixio, Sirtori, Cairoli&mdash;all the Knights of
the Legend.</p>

<p>Moving swiftly from place to place, and appearing where and when he was
least expected, Garibaldi took the entire country of the Lombard lakes.
Gyulai, who at first looked upon the Garibaldian march as a simple
diversion intended to draw off his attention, now became <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg.232]</a></span> concerned,
and dispatched Urban with 10,000 men to destroy the volunteers, and stem
the insurrection which everywhere followed in their wake. On the 27th of
May Garibaldi drove Urban from his position near San Fermo, and that
commander had his mission still unfulfilled when he received the order to
retreat after the battle of Magenta. The volunteers were free to pursue
their way to Brescia and the Valtellina, where they performed many feats
in the latter period of the war, winning the admiration of Hayn, the
Austrian general opposed to them, which he was generous enough to express
in no measured terms.</p>

<p>The great war was meanwhile approaching its climax. After Montebello
the whole French army executed a secret flank movement, changing its
position from Voghera, where Gyulai believed it to be, and whence he
expected it to move on to Piacenza, to the line of the Sesia, between
Cameriano and Casale. To mask the main operations, the Sardinian forces
were sent to Palestro, on the other side of the Sesia. On the 30th of May,
they drove in the outposts of the enemy, and on the 31st fought the
important engagement by which the Austrian attempt to retake Palestro was
repelled, and great damage caused to Zobel's corps, which was obliged to
leave eight guns sticking in the mud. The French Zouaves of the 3rd
regiment fought with the Piedmontese, and made the battle famous by the
reckless valour of their bayonet charges. Victor Emmanuel, deaf to all
remonstrances, placed himself at their head, in consequence of which they
elected him their corporal, an honour once paid to the first Napoleon.</p>

<p>There is reason to think that after Palestro, Gyulai, having at last
realised what Napoleon was about, wished to evacuate Lombardy, but was
prevented from doing so by strong protests sent by the Emperor Francis
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg.233]</a></span>
Joseph, who was at Verona. The Austrian army was in full retreat when it
was pulled up near Magenta, with the object of checking the advance of the
French, who had already begun to cross the Ticino by the bridges of San
Martino and Buffalora, which the Austrians had tried to blow up, but had
not succeeded from want of proper powder. In the great battle of the 4th
of June, Austrians and French numbered respectively about 60,000 men; no
Piedmontese were engaged till the evening, when a battalion of Bersaglieri
arrived. The Imperial Guard, with which was Napoleon, had to bear the
brunt of the fight for four hours, and ran a good chance of being
annihilated; not a brilliant proof of French generalship, but happily the
Austrians also committed grave mistakes. MacMahon's arrival at five in the
afternoon prevented a catastrophe, and the fighting, which continued far
into the night, was from this moment attended by results on the whole
advantageous to the French. Not much more can be said. Magenta was very
like a drawn battle. The Austrians are calculated to have lost 10,000 men,
the French between 4,000 and 5,000. It was expected that the Austrians
would renew the attack, but on the 5th, Gyulai ordered the retreat, which
was the last order he had the opportunity of giving, as he was deprived of
his command immediately after.</p>

<p>At mid-day on the 5th, Milan, which was trembling on the verge of
revolution, made the pleasurable discovery that there were no Austrians
left in the town. The municipality sent out delegates with the keys of the
city to Victor Emmanuel. At ten a.m. on the 7th, MacMahon's corps began to
file down the streets. Words cannot describe the welcome given to them.
How MacMahon lifted to his saddle-bow a child that was in danger of being
crushed by the crowd will be <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_234" id=
"Page_234">[Pg.234]</a></span> remembered from the pretty incident having
passed into English poetry. On the 8th, the King and the Emperor made
their entry amidst a new paroxysm of enthusiasm. Napoleon is reported to
have exclaimed: 'How this people must have suffered!' In his proclamation
'to the Italian people,' which bears the same date as his entry into
Milan, he renewed the assurance of the disinterested motives which had
brought him to Italy: 'Your enemies, who are also mine, have endeavoured
to diminish the universal sympathy felt in Europe for your cause, by
causing it to be believed that I am making war for personal ambition, or
to increase French territory. If there are men who fail to comprehend
their epoch, I am not one of them. In the enlightened state of public
opinion now prevailing, true greatness lies in the moral influence which
we exercise rather than in sterile conquests.' The proclamation ended with
the words: 'To-morrow you will be the citizens of a great country.' Not
the least effusive demonstrations were reserved for Cavour, who joined his
Sovereign a few days after the battle of Magenta.</p>

<hr />
<p>Leaving the Milanese to put their faith in princes while yet there was
time, a glance must be taken at what had been going on in the rest of
Italy, which was becoming a great nation far more rapidly, and in a much
fuller sense than Napoleon III. expected or wished. When Austria sent her
ultimatum to Turin, the Sardinian minister at the Court of Tuscany invited
the Grand Duke's Government to take part in the war of liberation. This
they refused to do. On perceiving, however, that he could not depend on
his troops, the Grand Duke promised to co-operate with Piedmont, but his
advisers did not now think it possible to save the grand ducal throne,
unless Leopold II. abdicated in favour of his <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg.235]</a></span> son, who was not
burdened with the fatal associations of the reaction of ten years before.
Leopold probably thought that even his abdication would not keep out the
deluge, and he took the more dignified course of declining to yield to
force. On the 27th of April, accompanied by the Corps Diplomatique as far
as the frontier, he left Tuscany. A Provisional Government was formed with
Peruzzi at its head, which hastily raised 8000 men for immediate service
under the command of General Ulloa. Before long Prince Napoleon, with the
fifth corps of the French army, landed, for no reason that could be
avowed, at Leghorn. The real motive was to prepare the way for the
fabrication of a new kingdom of Etruria, which existed already in
Napoleon's brain. This masterpiece of folly had but a lukewarm supporter
in Prince Napoleon, who was the only Napoleon and about the only Frenchman
(if he could be called one) who grasped the idea of the unity of Italy and
sincerely applauded it. Had J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Napoleon been born with
the least comprehension of self-respect and personal dignity, his strong
political intelligence and clear logical discernment must have produced
something better than the most ineffectual career of the century.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May, Baron Ricasoli took office under the Provisional
Government as Minister of the Interior, and for nearly twelve months he
was the real ruler of Tuscany. He had an ally of great strength, though of
humble origin, in Giuseppe Dolfi, the baker, of whom it was currently said
that any day he could summon 10,000 men to the Piazza della Signoria, who
would obey him to the death. To Dolfi it was due that there were no
disorders after the Grand Duke left. What Italy owes to the Lord of
Brolio, history will never adequately state, because it is well-nigh
impossible fully to realise how critical was <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg.236]</a></span> her position during all
that year, from causes external and internal, and how disastrous would
have been the slightest mistake or wavering in the direction of Tuscan
affairs, which formed the central hinge of the whole complicated
situation. Fortunate, indeed, was it that there was a man like the Iron
Baron, who, by simple force of will, outwitted the enemies of Italy more
thoroughly than even Cavour could do with all his astuteness. Austere,
aristocratic, immovable from his purpose, indifferent to praise or blame,
Ricasoli aimed at one point&mdash;the unity of the whole country; and
neither Cavour's impatience for annexation to Piedmont, nor the scheme of
Farini and Minghetti for averting the wrath of the French Emperor by a
temporary and preparatory union of the central states, drew him one inch
from the straight road, which was the only one he had ever learnt to walk
in.</p>

<p>In June, the Duke of Modena and the Duchess-Regent of Parma found it
impossible to remain in their states, now that Austrian protection was
withdrawn. The latter had done what she could to preserve the duchy for
her young son, but the tide was too strong. These revolutions were
accomplished quietly; but, some months after, on the incautious return to
Parma of a man deeply implicated in the abuses of Charles III.'s
government&mdash;Colonel Anviti&mdash;he was cruelly murdered; an act of
vengeance which happily remained alone.</p>

<p>After the battle of Magenta, when the Austrian troops were recalled
from the Marches and Romagna, those districts rose and demanded the
dictatorship of Piedmont. Napoleon foresaw that this would happen as far
back as the Plombi&egrave;res interview, and at that date it did not
appear that he meant to oppose it. But now, in Paris, the Clerical party
were seized with panic, and the Empress-Regent, then, as always,
completely under their control, did all in her power to arouse the <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg.237]</a></span>
Emperor's opposition. The Pope , on his part, knowing that he was secure
in Rome&mdash;thanks to the French garrison, which, though it hated its
office, as the French writer Amp&egrave;re and others bore witness, was
sure to perform it faithfully&mdash;had the idea of sending his Swiss
troops to put down the growing revolution. With these, and a few Roman
troops of the line, Colonel Schmidt marched against Perugia, where, in
restoring the Papal authority, he used a ferocity which, though denied by
clerical writers, was attested by all contemporary accounts, and was
called 'atrocious' by Sir James Hudson in a despatch to Lord John Russell.
The significance of such facts, wrote the English minister at Turin, could
only be the coming fall of the Pope's Temporal Power.</p>

<p>L.C. Farini was sent by Victor Emmanuel to administer the provinces of
Modena and Parma, and Massimo d'Azeglio was charged with the same mission
in Romagna. The Marches of Ancona had been recovered by the Papal troops,
which were concentrated in the district called La Cattolica, near Rimini.
A volunteer corps, under the Piedmontese General Mezzacapo, was entrusted
with the task of preventing them from crossing into the Legations.</p>

<p>In the month of May, when the allies were reaping their first
successes, an event occurred at Caserta which precipitated crisis in the
South Italy. Ferdinand II. died at forty-eight years of age of a terrible
complaint which had attacked him a few months earlier, when he went to
meet his son's bride, the Princess Maria Sofia of Bavaria, sister of the
Empress of Austria. The news from Upper Italy hastened his end; he is said
to have exclaimed not long before he died: 'They have won the cause!'</p>

<p>The accession of a youth, of whom nothing bad was known, to a throne
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg.238]</a></span>
that had been occupied by a sovereign so out of place in modern
civilisation as Ferdinand, would appear at first sight a fortunate
circumstance for the chances of the dynasty; but it was not so. In an
eastern country it matters little whether the best of the inhabitants
loathe and detest their ruler; but it matters much whether he knows how to
cajole and frighten the masses, and especially the army, into obedience.
Naples, more Oriental than western, possessed in Ferdinand a monarch
consummately expert in this side of the art of government. Though without
the higher military virtues, his army was his favourite plaything; he
always wore uniform, never forgot a face he had once seen, and treated the
officers with a rather vulgar familiarity, guessing at their weaknesses
and making use of them on occasion. The rank and file regarded him as a
sort of supernatural being. Francis II., who succeeded him, could scarcely
appear in this light even to the most ignorant. Popular opinion considered
him not quite sound in his mind. Probably his timorous, awkward ways and
his seeming stupidity were simply the result of an education conducted by
bigoted priests in a home that was no home: populated as it was by the
offspring of a stepmother who hated him. His own mother, the charming
Princess Cristina of Savoy, died while the city was rejoicing at his
birth. The story is well known of how, shortly after the marriage,
Ferdinand thought it diverting to draw a music-stool from under his wife,
causing her to fall heavily. It gives a sample of the sufferings of her
brief married life. An inheritance of sorrow descended from her to her
child.</p>

<p>If Francis II. was not popular, neither was the new queen. Far more
virile in character and in tastes than her husband, her high spirit was
not what the Neapolitans admire in women, and those who were <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg.239]</a></span> devoted to
the late King accused her of having shown impatience during his illness
for the moment when the crown would fall to Francis. Malicious gossip of
this kind, however false, serves its end. Thus, from one cause or another,
the young King exercised a power sensibly weaker than that of his father,
while, besides other enemies, he had an inveterate one in his stepmother,
who began weaving a conspiracy to oust him from the throne and place on it
the eldest of his half-brothers. This plot received, however, very little
popular support.</p>

<p>The Sardinian Government sought to persuade Francis to join in the war
against Austria; disinterested counsel, as in taking it lay his only hope,
but it was opposed by England, Russia and France. In July two of the Swiss
regiments at Naples mutinied. The Swiss Government, becoming alive to the
discredit cast on the country by mercenary service, had decided that Swiss
subjects serving abroad should lose their rights as citizens of the
Confederation whilst so employed, and that they should no longer introduce
the arms of their respective cantons into their regimental colours. This
was the immediate cause of their insubordination. The mutineers, most of
whom were unarmed, were ruthlessly shot down in the Campo di Marte to the
terror of the population, and the two Swiss regiments which remained quiet
were dissolved; by which the monarchy lost the troops that were chiefly to
be depended on in emergencies. The Austrians and Bavarians imported in
their stead did not form separate regiments, but were incorporated among
the native troops, though the regiments that contained them were commonly
called 'Bavarian.' They only partially filled the place of the Swiss.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg.240]</a></span>


<hr />
<p>Between the 4th and the 24th of June, no engagement of any magnitude
was fought in Lombardy except the attack on Benedek at Melegnano, a battle
in which the French lost most men, and gained no strategical advantage. It
was supposed to have been fought because Napoleon I. had gained a victory
in the same neighbourhood. The Austrians retreated to the Mincio,
destroying the bridges over the Adda, Serio, Oglio and Mella as they went;
these rivers the allies had to make repassable, which is the excuse given
for the dilatory nature of their pursuit of the enemy. The Emperor Francis
Joseph had now assumed the command, with Hess as his principle adviser,
and Wimpffen and Schlick, famous as the 'One-eyed,' as heads of the two
great corps into which the army was divided.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of June, the Austrians were ranged along the left bank of
the Mincio from Peschiera to Mantua, and the French were massed near
Montechiaro, on the Brescia road, which Napoleon had made his
headquarters. In withdrawing all their men from the right bank of the
river, the Austrians desired to create the impression that they had
finally abandoned it. It was their plan, which did not lack boldness, to
throw the whole army back upon the right bank, and to perform a concentric
movement on Montechiaro, where they hoped to fall unawares on the French
and destroy them. They were confident of success, for they knew what a
good stand they had made at Magenta, and now that Gyulai was got rid of,
and the young Emperor had taken the field, they did not doubt that fortune
would turn her wheel. To these men of many nations, the presence of their
Emperor was the one inspiration that could rouse them, for if they were
fighting for anything, it was for him in the most personal sense; it was
to secure his mastery of the <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_241" id=
"Page_241">[Pg.241]</a></span> splendid land over which he looked from the
castle of Valleggio, on the 23rd of June, whilst his brilliant staff stood
round, waiting for the signal to mount and clatter down the steep road to
the Mincio bridge. The army now advanced along all its line.</p>

<p>Even the soberest writers have not resisted making some reference to
the magnificent scene of to-morrow's battle. On one side, the mountain
bulwarks rising tier on tier, gorgeous with the trancendent beauty of
colour and light of the Italian summer; on the other, the vine-clad
hillocks which fall gently away from the blue lake of Garda till they are
lost in the</p>

<pre>
        .....harvest shining plain
        Where the peasant heaps his grain
        In the garner of his foe.
</pre>

<p>The 24th of June was to decide how much longer the Lombard peasant
should labour to fill a stranger's treasury.</p>

<p>The calculations of the Austrians were founded on the slowness which
had hitherto characterised Napoleon's movements. Hess thought that two
days might be safely allowed for the Austrian advance, and that the enemy
would remain passive on the west bank of the river Chiese, waiting to be
attacked on the 25th. If the operation could have been performed in one
day, and it is thought that it could, there would have been more prospect
of success. But even then, the original plan of attacking the allies west
of the Chiese could not have been carried out, as on the 23rd the whole
allied army moved forward, the French occupying Castiglione and Lonato,
and the Sardinians Rezzato and Desenzano, on the lake of Garda. It is not
clear how far the allies believed in the Austrian advance; that they had
warning of it from several quarters is certain. For instance, a gentleman
living at <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">
[Pg.242]</a></span> Desenzano heard from the country people, who, for
marketing or other purposes, constantly go to and fro between that place
and Peschiera, that the Austrians had ordered a quantity of country carts
and transport waggons to be in readiness on the 23rd, and he hastened with
the intelligence to the Piedmontese General Delia Rocca, who, in a fine
spirit of red-tapism, pooh-poohed the information. The French encountered
several Austrian patrols in the course of the day, but they were inclined
to think that the Austrians were only executing a reconnaissance. On the
whole, it seems that the conflict came as a surprise to both sides.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Austria, after accompanying the advance for a short
distance, returned with Hess to Valleggio for the night. Napoleon slept at
Montechiaro. The Austrian forces bivouacked on the little hills between
Solferino and Cavriana. They rested well, still confident that no fighting
would be done next day. At two in the morning, the French began to move in
the direction of Solferino, and the Sardinians in that of Peschiera. There
is a legend, that in the grey mists of dawn an advance party of French
cavalry espied a huge and gaunt hussar standing by the roadside. For a
moment the figure was lost sight of, but it reappeared, and after running
across the road in front of the French, it turned and dealt the officer
who led the party so tremendous a blow that he fell off his horse. Then
the adventurous Austrian fled, followed by a volley from the French
troopers; the sound vibrating through the dawn stillness gave the call to
arms to the contrasted hosts. The battle of Solferino had begun.</p>

<p>The news flew to Montechiaro and to Valleggio. Napoleon started for
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg.243]</a></span>
the scene of action with the Imperial Guard; Francis Joseph's staff was
sent forward at six a.m., but the Emperor and Hess did not start till
later. At near nine, the staff was looking for the Emperor, and the
Emperor was looking for the staff in the open country about Volta; the
sixty or seventy staff-officers dashed across ploughed fields and over
hedges and ditches, in a style which would have done credit to an English
fox-hunt. This remarkable incident was in keeping with the general
management of the battle on the part of the Austrians, who had been
fighting for many hours before the commander-in-chief arrived. After his
arrival, they continued fighting without any visible plan, according to
the expedients of the divisional generals. The particular expedient
adopted by General Zedwitz was to withdraw 15,000 men, including six
regiments of cavalry, from the field. At a critical moment, Count Clam
Gallas had the misfortune to lose his artillery reserve, and sent
everywhere to ask if anyone had seen it. The Prince of Hesse, acting
without orders, or against orders, separated his division from
Schwarzenberg's and brought it up at the nick of time to save the
Austrians, when they were threatened with actual destruction, at two
o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>At that hour the French were in possession of the Spia d'Italia, and of
all the heights of Solferino. They had been engaged in attacking them
since eight in the morning, Napoleon having seen at once that they were
the key to the position, and must be taken, cost what it might. The cost
was great; if there is any episode in French military history in which
soldiers and officers earned all the praise that can be given to brave
men, it is the taking of these Solferino hills. Again and again Forey's
division and Bazaine's brigade returned to the <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg.244]</a></span> charge; the cemetery and
streets of Solferino were piled up with their dead, mingled with the dead
of the defenders, who contested every inch of ground. The individual
valour of the French soldiers in that six hours' struggle made it possible
to win the battle.</p>

<p>The Austrians, however, after their desperate straits at two o'clock
recovered to so great an extent that, had Zedwitz returned with his
cavalry, as the Emperor was hoping that he would, the day might still have
been theirs. Even as it was, MacMahon's corps swerved under Zobel's
repulse of his attack on San Cassiano, and Niel, in the plain, was
dangerously hard pressed by Schwarzenberg. But, by degrees, the French
recommenced gaining and the Austrians losing ground, and at six p.m., the
latter were retreating in good order, defending each step before they
yielded it.</p>

<p>In the last stage of the battle the French limbered up their guns in
the belief that a vast reserve of Austrian cavalry was galloping into
action. What made them think so was a dense yellowish wall advancing
through the air. Had they been natives, they would have recognised the
approach of one of those frightful storms which bring devastation in their
train, and which, as they move forward in what appears a solid mass, look
to the inexperienced eye exactly like the clouds of dust raised by
innumerable horsemen. The bursting of the storm hastened the end of the
fight.</p>

<p>All the day another fight, separate from this, had been going on
between Benedek and the Sardinian army near the knoll of San Martino,
overlooking the lake of Garda. The battle, which began in the early
morning among the cypresses that crown the hillock, raged till seven <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg.245]</a></span> p.m.
with a fury which cost the Piedmontese over 4,000 in dead and wounded. It
consisted largely in hand-to-hand fighting, which now gave an advantage to
the Austrians, now to the Italians; many of the positions were lost and
re-taken more than half-a-dozen times; the issue seemed long doubtful, and
when Benedek, who commanded his side with unquestionable ability, received
orders from the field of Solferino to begin a retreat, each combatant was
firmly convinced that he was getting the best of it. Austrian writers
allege that this order saved the Sardinians from defeat, while in both
Italian and French narratives, the Piedmontese are represented as having
been already sure of success. The courage shown alike by Piedmontese and
Austrians could not be surpassed. Victor Emmanuel, as usual, set an
example to his men.</p>

<p>An incident in the battle brings into striking relief what it was this
bloody strife was meant to end. An Austrian corporal fell, mortally
wounded by a Bersagliere whom he conjured, in Italian, to listen to what
he had got to say. It was this: Forced into the Austrian army, he had been
obliged to serve through the war, but had never fired his rifle on his
fellow-countrymen; now he preferred to die rather than defend himself. So
he yielded up his breath with his hand clasped in the hand which had slain
him.</p>

<p>The Austrians lost, on the 24th of June, 13,000 men in killed and
wounded; the French, 10,000. It was said that the frightful scene of
carnage on the battlefield after Solferino influenced Napoleon III. in his
desire to stop the war. Had that scene vanished from his recollection in
June 1870?</p>

<p>Even a field of battle, with its unburied dead, speaks only of a small
part of the miseries of a great war. Those who were at that time at <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg.246]</a></span>
Brescia, to which town the greater portion of the French wounded and all
the worst cases were brought, still shudder as they recall the dreadful
human suffering which no skill or devotion could do more than a very
little to assuage. The noble Brescian ladies who had once nursed Bayard,
turned, with one accord, into sisters of charity; every house, every
church, became a hospital, all that gratitude and pity could do was done;
but many were to leave their bones in Italy, and how many more to go home
maimed for life, or bearing with them the seeds of death.</p>

<p>Other reasons than those of sentiment in reality decided Napoleon's
course. Though these can only be guessed at, the guess, at the present
date, amounts to certainty. In the first place, the skin-deep rejoicings
in Paris at the news of the victories did not hide the fact that French
public opinion, never genuinely favourable to the war, was becoming more
and more hostile to it. Then there was the military question. It is true
that the Fifth Corps, estimated at 30,000 men, had, at last, emerged from
its crepuscular doings in Tuscany, and was available for future
operations. Moreover, Kossuth paid a visit to the Imperial headquarters,
and held out hopes of a revolution in Hungary which would oblige the
Austrian Emperor to remove part of his troops from the scene of the war.
Nevertheless, Napoleon was by no means convinced that his army was
sufficient to take the Quadrilateral. He realised the bad organisation and
numerous shortcomings of the forces under him so vividly that it seems
incredible that, in the eleven following years, he should have done
nothing to remedy them. He attributed his success mainly to chance, though
in a less degree to a certain lack of energy in the Austrians, joined with
the exaggerated fear of responsibility felt by their leaders. He never
could <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">
[Pg.247]</a></span> thoroughly understand why the Austrians had not won
Solferino. Naturally, he did not express these opinions to his marshals,
but there is ample proof that he held them; and if the fact stood alone,
it ought not to be difficult to explain why he was not anxious for a
continuance of the war.</p>

<p>But it does not stand alone. Napoleon feared being defeated on the
Rhine as well as in the Quadrilateral. Prussia had six army corps ready,
and she was about to move them. That, after her long hesitations, she
resolved to intervene was long doubted, but it cannot be so after the
evidence which recent years have produced.</p>

<p>At the time things wore a different complexion. Europe was never more
amazed than when, on the 6th of July, Napoleon the victor sent General
Fleury to Francis Joseph the vanquished with a request for an armistice.
One point only was plain; an armistice meant peace without Venetia, and
never did profound sorrow so quickly succeed national joy than when this,
to contemporaries astonishing intelligence, went forth. But the blow fell
on no Italian with such tremendous force as on Cavour.</p>

<p>There are natives of Italy who appear to be more cool, more
calculating, more completely masters of themselves, than the men of any
other nationality. Cavour was one of these. But there comes, sooner or
later, the assertion of southern blood, the explosion of feeling the more
violent because long contained, and the cool, quiet Italian of yesterday
is not to be recognised except by those who know the race intimately well,
and who know the volcano that underlies its ice and snow as well as its
luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 6th of June, the French army was spread out in <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg.248]</a></span>
battle array along the left bank of the Mincio, and everything led to the
supposition that a new and immediate battle was in contemplation. The
Piedmontese were engaged in making preparations to invest Peschiera.
Napoleon's headquarters were at Valleggio, those of the King at
Monzambano. By the evening a very few persons had picked up the
information that Napoleon had sent a messenger to Verona. Victor Emmanuel
knew nothing of it, nor did any of the French generals except Marshal
Vaillant, but such things leak out, and two or three individuals were
aware of the journey to Verona, and spent that night in racking their
brains as to what it might mean. Next day at eleven o'clock General Fleury
returned; the Austrian Emperor had accepted the armistice. Further secrecy
was impossible, and like lightning the news flashed through the world.</p>

<p>Cavour rushed from Turin to Desenzano, where he arrived the day before
the final meeting between Napoleon and Francis Joseph. He waited for a
carnage in the little <i>caf&eacute;</i> in the piazza; no one guessed who
it was, and conversation went on undisturbed: it was full of curses on the
French Emperor. Mazzini, someone said, was right; this is the way the war
was sure to end. When a shabby conveyance had at length been found, the
great statesman drove to Monzambano. There, of course, his arrival did not
escape notice, and all who saw him were horrified by the change that had
come over his face. Instead of the jovial, witty smile, there was a look
of frantic rage and desperation. What passed between him and his Sovereign
is partly a matter of conjecture; the exact sense of the violent words
into which his grief betrayed him is lost, in spite of the categorical
versions of the interview which have been printed. Even in a fit of
madness he can hardly have spoken some of the words attributed to him.
That he advised the King to withdraw <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg.249]</a></span> his army or to abdicate
rather than agree to the peace which was being plotted behind his back,
seems past doubting. It is said that after attempting in vain to calm him,
Victor Emmanuel brought the interview to a sudden close. Cavour came out
of the house flushed and exhausted, and drove back to Desenzano. He had
resigned office.</p>

<p>The King showed extraordinary self-control. Bitter as the draught was,
he saw that it must be drunk, and he was determined to drink it with
dignity. Probably no other Italian grasped as clearly as he did the real
reason which actuated Napoleon; at any rate his chivalrous appreciation of
the benefits already received, closed his lips to reproaches. 'Whatever
may be the decision of your Majesty,' he said to the Emperor on the eve of
Villafranca, 'I shall feel an eternal gratitude for what you have done for
the independence of Italy, and I beg you to believe that under all
circumstances you may reckon on my complete fidelity.'</p>

<p>If there was sadness in the Sardinian camp, so there was in that of
Austria. The Austrians by no means thought that the game was up for them.
It would be interesting to know by what arguments Napoleon persuaded the
young Emperor to renounce the hope of retrieving his disasters, whilst he
slowly pulled to pieces some flowers which were on the table before which
he and Francis Joseph sat. When they left the house, the heir to all the
Hapsburgs looked pale and sad. Did he remember the dying counsels of
'Father' Radetsky&mdash;not to yield if he was beaten on the Mincio, on
the Tagliamento, on the Isonzo, before the gates of Vienna.</p>

<p>When, on the evening of the same day, the Emperor of Austria signed the
preliminaries of peace, he said to Prince Napoleon, who took the <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg.250]</a></span>
document to Verona for his signature: 'I pray God that if you are ever a
sovereign He may spare you the hour of grief I have just passed.' Yet the
defeat of Solferino and the loss of Lombardy were the first steps in the
transformation of Radetsky's pupil from a despot, who hourly feared
revolution in every land under his sceptre, to a wise and constitutional
monarch ruling over a contented Empire. To some individuals and to some
states, misfortune is fortune.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h4>WHAT UNITY COST</h4>

<h5>1859-1860</h5>

<h5>Napoleon III. and Cavour&mdash;The Cession of Savoy and
Nice&mdash;Annexations in Central Italy.</h5>

<br />
<p>Napoleon's hurried journey to Turin on his way back to France was
almost a flight. Everywhere his reception was cold in the extreme. He was
surprised, he said, at the ingratitude of the Italians. It was still
possible to ask for gratitude, as the services rendered had not been paid
for; no one spoke yet of the barter of Savoy and Nice. But Napoleon, when
he said these words to the Governor of Milan, forgot how the Lombards, in
June 1848, absolutely refused to take their freedom at the cost of
resigning Venice to Austria. And if Venice was dear to them and to Italy
then, how much dearer had she not become since the heroic struggle in
which she was the last to yield. The bones of Manin cried aloud for
Venetian liberty from his grave of exile.</p>

<p>Venice was the one absorbing thought of the moment; yet there were
clauses in the brief preliminaries of peace more fraught with insidious
danger than the abandonment of Venice. If the rest of Italy became one and
free, it needed no prophet to tell that not the might of twenty Austrias
could keep Venetia permanently outside the fold. <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg.252]</a></span> But if Italy was to
remain divided and enslaved, then, indeed, the indignant question went up
to heaven, To what end had so much blood been shed?</p>

<p>When he resolved to cut short the war, Napoleon still had it in his
power to go down to history as the supreme benefactor of Italy. He chose
instead to become her worst and by far her most dangerous enemy. The
preliminaries of peace opened with the words: 'The Emperor of Austria and
the Emperor of the French will favour the creation of an Italian
Confederation under the honorary presidency of the Holy Father.' Further,
it was stated that the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Duke of Modena would
return to their states. Though Napoleon proposed at first to add, 'without
foreign armed intervention,' he waived the point (Rome was in his mind)
and no such guarantee was inserted. Here, then, was the federative
programme which all the personal influence and ingenuity of the French
Emperor, all the arts of French diplomacy, were concentrated on
maintaining, and which was only defeated by the true patriotism and strong
good sense of the Italian populations, and of the men who led them through
this, the most critical period in their history.</p>

<p>In England Lord Derby's administration had fallen and the Liberals were
again in power. Napoleon was so strangely deluded as to expect to find
support in that quarter for his anti-unionist conspiracy. His earliest
scheme was that the federative plan should be presented to Europe by Great
Britain. Lord John Russell answered: 'We are asked to propose a partition
(<i>morcellement</i>) of the peoples of Italy, as if we had the right to
dispose of them.' It was a happy circumstance for Italy that her unity had
no better friends than in the English Government during those difficult
years. Cavour's words soon after Villafranca, 'It is England's turn now,'
were not belied.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">
[Pg.253]</a></span> One thing should have made Napoleon uneasy; a man like
Cavour, when his blood is roused, when his nature is fired by the
strongest passions that move the human heart, is an awkward adversary. If
there was an instant in which the great statesman thought that all was
lost, it was but an instant. With the quick rebound of virile characters
he recovered his balance and understood his part. It was to fight and
conquer.</p>

<p>'Your Emperor has dishonoured me,' he said to M. Pietri in the presence
of Kossuth (the interview taking place at Turin on the 15th of July).
'Yes, sir, he has dishonoured me,' and he set forth how, after promising
to hunt the last Austrian out of Italy, after secretly exacting the price
of his assistance to which Cavour had induced his good and honest King to
consent, he now left them solemnly in the lurch; Lombardy might suffice!
And, for nothing to be wanting, the King was to be forced into a
confederation with Austria and the Italian princes under the presidency of
the Pope. After painting the situation with all the irony and scorn of
which he was master, he gave his note of warning: 'If needs be, I will
become a conspirator, I will become a revolutionist, but this treaty shall
never be executed; a thousand times no&mdash;never!'</p>

<p>The routine business of the Prime Minister still fell to Cavour, as
Rattazzi, who succeeded him, had not yet formed his cabinet. He was
obliged, therefore, to write officially to the Royal Commissioners at
Modena, Bologna and Florence to abandon their posts. But in the character
of Cavour, the private citizen, he telegraphed to them at the same time to
remain and do their duty. And they remained.</p>

<p>On one point there was a temporary lull of anxiety. Almost the last
words spoken by Napoleon to Victor Emmanuel before he left Turin were:
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg.254]</a></span>
'We shall think no more about Nice and Savoy.' The mention of Nice shows
that though it had not been promised, Napoleon was all along set upon its
acquisition. It is impossible to say how far, at the moment, he was
sincere in the renunciation. That, very soon after his return to Paris, he
was diligently weaving plans for getting both provinces into his net, is
evident from the tenor of the articles and notes published in the
'inspired' French newspapers.</p>

<p>Two chief motives can be divined for Napoleon's determined opposition
to Italian unity which never ceased till Sedan. The first was his wish,
shared by all French politicians, that Italy should be weak. The second
was his regard for the Temporal Power which proceeded from his still being
convinced that he could not reign without the Clerical vote. The French
prelates were perpetually giving him reminders that this vote depended on
his keeping the Pope on his throne. For instance, Cardinal Donnet told him
at Bordeaux in October 1859, that he could not choose a better way of
showing his appreciation of the Blessed Virgin than 'en m&eacute;nageant
un triomphe &agrave; son Fils dans la personne de son Vicaire.' It would
be a triumph which the Catholic world would salute with transport. Hints
of this sort, the sense of which was not hard to read, in spite of their
recondite phraseology, reached him from every quarter. He feared to set
them aside. The origins of his power were too much tainted for him to
advance boldly on an independent policy. Thus it was that bit by bit he
deliberately forfeited all title to the help of Italy when the same
whirlwind that dashed him to earth, cleared the way for the final
accomplishment of her national destinies.</p>

<p>Whilst Victor Emmanuel was more alive than Cavour to the military
arguments in favour of stopping hostilities when the tide of success <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg.255]</a></span> was
at its height, he was not one whit more disposed to stultify his past by
becoming the vassal at once of Paris and Vienna. In a letter written to
the Emperor of the French in October, in answer to a very long one in
which Napoleon sought to convert him to the plan of an Austro-Italian
Confederation, he wound up by saying: 'For the considerations above
stated, and for many others, I cannot, Sire, second your Majesty's policy
in Italy. If your Majesty is bound by treaties and cannot revoke your
engagements in the (proposed) congress, I, Sire, am bound on my side, by
honour in the face of Europe, by right and duty, by the interests of my
house, of my people and of Italy. My fate is joined to that of the Italian
people. We can succumb, but never betray. Solferino and San Martino may
sometimes redeem Novara and Waterloo, but the apostasies of princes are
always irreparable. I am moved to the bottom of my soul by the faith and
love which this noble and unfortunate people has reposed in me, and rather
than be unworthy of it, I will break my sword and throw the crown away as
did my august father. Personal interest does not guide me in defending the
annexations; the Sword and Time have borne my house from the summit of the
Alps to the banks of the Mincio, and those two guardian angels of the
Savoy race will bear it further still, when it pleases God.'</p>

<p>The events in Central Italy to which the King alludes were of the
highest importance. L.C. Farini, the Sardinian Royal Commissioner at
Modena, when relieved of his office, assumed the dictatorship by the will
of the people. L. Cipriani became Governor of Romagna, and at Florence
Ricasoli continued at the head of affairs, undismayed and unshaken in his
resolve to defeat the combined machinations of France and Austria. In
August the populations of Modena, Reggio, Parma and <span class="newpage">
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg.256]</a></span> Piacenza declared
their union with Piedmont by an all but unanimous popular vote, the two
last provinces placing themselves for temporary convenience under the
Dictator Farini. A few days later, Tuscany and Romagna voted a like act of
union through their Constituent Assemblies. The representatives of the
four States, Modena, Parma, Romagna and Tuscany, formally announced to the
great Powers their choice of Victor Emmanuel, in whose rule they
recognised the sole hope of preserving their liberties and avoiding
disorder. Delegates were sent to Turin with the offer of the crown.</p>

<p>Peace, of which the preliminaries only were signed at Villafranca, was
not yet definitely concluded, and a large French army was still in Italy.
The King's government feared therefore to adopt the bold course of
accepting the annexations outright, and facing the responsibilities which
might arise. Victor Emmanuel thanked the delegates, expressing his
confidence that Europe would not undo the great work that had been done in
Central Italy. The state of things, however, in these provinces, whose
elected King could not yet govern them, was anomalous, most of all in what
related to defence; they being menaced on the Austrian side by the Duke of
Modena, and on the South by the Papal troops in the Cattolica. An armed
force of 25,000 men was organised, of which the Tuscan contingent was
under the command of Garibaldi, and the rest under that of the Sardinian
General Fanti, 'lent' for the purpose. Garibaldi hoped not merely to
defend the provinces already emancipated, but to carry war into the
enemy's camp and make revolution possible throughout the States of the
Church. To the Party of Action the chance seemed an unique one of
hastening the progress of events. Unaccustomed as they were to weigh
diplomatic <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">
[Pg.257]</a></span> difficulties, they saw the advantages but not the
perils of a daring course. Meanwhile Napoleon threatened to occupy
Piacenza with 30,000 men on the first forward step of Garibaldi, who, on
his side, seemed by no means inclined to yield either to the orders of the
Dictator Farini, or to the somewhat violent measures taken to stop him by
General Fanti, who instructed the officers under his command to disobey
him. It was then that Victor Emmanuel tried his personal influence, rarely
tried without success, over the revolutionary chief, who reposed absolute
faith in the King's patriotism, and who was therefore amenable to his
arguments when all others failed. The general was summoned to Turin, and
in an audience given on the 16th of November, Victor Emmanuel persuaded
him that the proposed enterprise would retard rather than advance the
cause of Italian freedom. Garibaldi left for Caprera, only insisting that
his 'weak services' should be called into requisition whenever there was
an opportunity to act.</p>

<p>Before quitting the Adriatic coast the hero of Rome went one evening
with his two children, Menotti and Teresita, to the Chapel in the Pine
Forest, where their mother was buried. Within a mile was the farmhouse
where he had embraced her lifeless form before undertaking his perilous
flight from sea to sea. In 1850, at Staten Island, when he was earning his
bread as a factory hand, he wrote the prophetic words: 'Anita, a land of
slavery holds your precious dust; Italy will make your grave free, but
what can restore to your children their incomparable mother?' Garibaldi's
visit to Anita's grave closes the story of the brave and tender woman who
sacrificed all to the love she bore him.</p>

<p>After sitting for three months, the Conference which met at Zurich to
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg.258]</a></span>
establish the definite treaty of peace finished its labours on the 10th of
November. The compact was substantially the same as that arranged at
Villafranca. Victor Emmanuel, who had signed the Preliminaries with the
reservation implied in the note: 'In so far as I am concerned,' preserved
the same liberty of action in the Treaty of Zurich. He still hesitated,
however, in assuming the government of the central provinces, and even the
plan of sending the Prince of Carignano as governor fell through in
consequence of Napoleon's opposition. His hesitations sprang from the
general apprehension that a hint from Paris might any day be followed by a
new eruption of Austrians in Modena and Tuscany for the purpose of
replacing the former rulers of those states on their thrones. Such a fear
existed at the time, and Rattazzi's timid policy was the result; it is
impossible not to ask now whether it was not exaggerated? 'What
statesman,' wrote the Prince Consort in June 1859, 'could adopt measures
to force Austrian rule again upon delighted, free Italy?' If this was true
in June was it less true in November? For the rest, would not the supreme
ridicule that would have fallen on the French Emperor if he encouraged the
Austrians to return to Central Italy after driving them out of Lombardy,
have obliged him to support the principle of non-intervention, whether he
wished it or not? England was prepared to back up the government of
Piedmont, in which lay a great moral force. It is plain that the long
wavering about what ought to be done with the central provinces is what
cost the country Savoy and Nice, or at any rate, Nice. Napoleon did all in
his power to prevent and to retard the annexations, especially that of
Tuscany, which, as he said, 'would make Italian unity a mere question of
time,' but when he found that neither threats nor blandishments could move
the population from their <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_259" id=
"Page_259">[Pg.259]</a></span> resolve to have Victor Emmanuel for their
king, he decided to sell his adhesion for a good price. Compelled for the
sake of appearances to withdraw his claim after the abrupt termination of
the war, he now saw an excellent excuse for reviving it, and he was not
likely to let the opportunity slip.</p>

<p>At this period there was continual talk, which may or may not have been
intended to end in talk, of a Congress to which the affairs of Italy were
to be referred. It gave an opening to Napoleon for publishing one of the
anonymous pamphlets by means of which he was in the habit of throwing out
tentative ideas, and watching their effect. The chief idea broached in <i>
Le Pape et le Congr&egrave;s</i> was the voluntary renunciation by the
Pope of all but a small zone of territory round Rome; it being pointed out
that his position as an independent sovereign would remain unaffected by
such an act, which would smooth the way to his assuming the hegemony of
the Italian Confederation. The Pope, however, let it be clearly known that
he had no intention of ceding a rood of his possessions, or of recognising
the separation of the part which had already escaped from him. Anyone
acquainted with the long strife and millennial manoeuvres by which the
Church had acquired the States called by her name, will understand the
unwillingness there was to yield them. To do Pius IX. justice, an
objection which merits more respect weighed then and always upon his mind.
He thought that he was personally debarred by the oath taken on assuming
the tiara from giving up the smallest part of the territory he received
from his predecessor. The Ultramontane party knew that they had only to
remind him of this oath to provoke a fresh assertion of <i>Non
possumus.</i> The attitude of the Pope was one reason why the Congress was
abandoned; but there was a deeper reason. A European <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg.260]</a></span> Congress
would certainly not have approved the cession of Nice and Savoy, and to
that object the French Emperor was now turning all his attention.</p>

<p>At Turin there was an ignoble cabal, supported not so much, perhaps, by
Rattazzi himself as by followers, the design of which was to prevent
Cavour from returning to power. Abroad, the Empress Eug&eacute;nie, who
looked on Cavour as the Pope's worst foe, did what she could to further
the scheme, and its promoters counted much on the soreness left in Victor
Emmanuel's mind by the scene after Villafranca. That soreness did, in
fact, still exist; but when in January the Rattazzi ministry fell, the
King saw that it was his duty to recall Cavour to his counsels, and he at
once charged him to form a cabinet.</p>

<p>That Cavour accepted the task is the highest proof of his abnegation as
a statesman. He was on the point of getting into his carriage to catch the
train for Leri when the messenger reached the Palazzo Cavour with the
royal command to go to the castle. If he had refused office and returned
to the congenial activity of his life as a country gentleman, his name
would not be attached to the melancholy sacrifice which Napoleon was now
determined to exact from Italy. The French envoy, Baron de Talleyrand,
whose business it was to communicate the unwelcome intelligence, arrived
at Turin before the collapse of Rattazzi; but, on finding that a
ministerial crisis was imminent, he deferred carrying out his mission till
a more opportune moment.</p>

<p>On the 18th of January 1860, the Emperor admitted to Lord Cowley that,
though there was as yet no arrangement between himself and Victor Emmanuel
on the subject, he intended to have Savoy. After the long series of
denials of any such design, the admission caused the most indignant
feeling in the English ministers and in the Queen, who <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg.261]</a></span> wrote to
Lord John Russell: 'We have been made regular dupes.' She went on to say
that the revival of the English Alliance, and the hymns of universal peace
chanted in Paris on the occasion of the Commercial Treaty, had been simply
so many blinds, 'to hide from Europe a policy of spoliation.' Cavour came
in for a part of the blame, as, during the war, he denied cognisance of
the proposal to give up Savoy. The best that can be said of that denial
is, that it was diplomatically impracticable for one party in the
understanding of Plombi&egrave;res to make a clean breast of the truth,
whilst the other party was assuring the whole universe that he was
fighting for an idea.</p>

<p>When the war was broken off, Cavour fully expected that Napoleon, of
whom he had the worst opinion, would then and there demand whole pay for
his half service; and this had much to do with his furious anger at
Villafranca; but later, in common with the best-informed persons, he
believed that the claim was finally withdrawn. When, however, Napoleon
asked again for the provinces&mdash;not as the price of the war, but of
the annexations in Central Italy&mdash;Cavour instantly came to the
conclusion that, cost what it might (and he thought that, amongst other
things, it would cost his own reputation and popularity), the demand must
be granted. Otherwise Italian unity would never be accomplished.</p>

<p>In considering whether he was mistaken, it must not be forgotten that
the French troops were still in Italy. Not to speak of those in Rome,
Marshal Vaillant had five divisions of infantry and two brigades of
cavalry in Lombardy up to the 20th of March 1860. The engagement had been
to send this army home as soon as the definite peace was concluded; why,
then, was it still south of the Alps four months after?</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">
[Pg.262]</a></span> In spite of this, however, and in spite of the
difficulty of judging an act, all the reasons for which may not, even now,
be in possession of the world, it is very hard indeed to pardon Cavour for
having yielded Nice as well as Savoy to France. The Nizzards were Italians
as the lower class of the population is Italian still; they had always
shown warm sympathy with the hopes of Italy, which could not be said of
the Savoyards; and Nice was the birthplace of Garibaldi!</p>

<p>England would have supported and applauded resistance to the claim for
Nice on general grounds, though her particular interest was in Savoy, or
rather in that part of the Savoy Alps which was neutralised by treaty in
1814. It was the refusal of Napoleon to adopt the compromise of ceding
this district to Switzerland which caused the breach between him and the
British ministry. From that moment, also, Prussia began to increase her
army, and resolved, when she was ready, to check the imperial ambition by
force of arms. 'The loss of Alsace and Lorraine,' writes an able
publicist, M.E. Tallichet, 'was the direct consequence of the annexation
of Nice and Savoy.'</p>

<p>If anything could have rendered more galling to Italy the deprivation
of these two provinces, it was the tone adopted in France when speaking of
the transaction. What were Savoy and Nice? A barren rock and an
insignificant strip of coast! The French of thirty-four years ago
travelled so little that they may have believed in the description. The
vast military importance of the ceded districts has been already referred
to. Some scraps on the Nice frontier were saved in a curious way: They
were spots which formed part of the favourite playground of the Royal
Hunter of the Alps, and it was pointed out to <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg.263]</a></span> Napoleon that it would
be a graceful act to leave these particular 'barren rocks' to his
Sardinian Majesty. The zig-zags in the line of demarcation which were thus
introduced are said to be of great strategic advantage to Italy. So far,
so good; but it remains true that France is <i>inside</i> the Italian
front-door.</p>

<p>At the elections for the new Chamber in March 1860, the Nizzards chose
Garibaldi; and this was their real plebiscite&mdash;not that which
followed at a short interval, and presented the phenomenon of a population
which appeared to change its mind as to its nationality in the course of a
few weeks. In voting for Garibaldi, they voted for Italy.</p>

<p>The Nizzard hero made some desperate efforts on behalf of his
fellow-citizens in the Chamber, not his natural sphere, and was on the
brink of making other efforts in a sphere in which he might have succeeded
better. He had the idea of going to Nice with about 200 followers, and
exciting just enough of a revolution to let the real will of the people be
known, and to frustrate the wiles of French emissaries and the pressure of
government in the official plebiscite of the 15th of April. The story of
the conspiracy, which is unknown in Italy, has been told by one of the
conspirators, the late Lawrence Oliphant. The English writer, who reached
Turin full of wrath at the proposed cession, was introduced to Garibaldi,
from whom he received the news of the proposed enterprise. Oliphant
offered his services, which were accepted, and he accompanied the general
to Genoa, where he engaged a diligence which was to carry the vanguard to
Nice. But, on going to Garibaldi for the last orders, he found him supping
with twenty or thirty young men; 'All Sicilians!' said the chief. 'We must
give up the Nice programme; the general opinion is that we shall lose
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg.264]</a></span>
all if we try for too much.' He added that he had hoped to carry out the
Nice plan first, but now everything must be sacrificed to freeing Sicily.
And he asked Oliphant to join the Thousand, an offer which the adventurous
Englishman never ceased to regret that he did not accept. As it was, he
elected to go all the same to Nice, where he was the spectator and became
the historian of the arts which brought about the semblance of an
unanimous vote in favour of annexation to France.</p>

<p>The ratification of the treaty&mdash;which, by straining the
constitution, was concluded without consulting Parliament&mdash;was
reluctantly given by the Piedmontese Chambers, the majority of members
fearing the responsibility of upsetting an accomplished fact. Cavour, when
he laid down the pen after signing the deed of cession, turned to Baron de
Talleyrand with the remark: 'Now we are accomplices!' His face, which had
been depressed, resumed its cheerful air. In fact, though Napoleon's
dislike of the central annexations was unabated, he could no longer oppose
them. Victor Emmanuel accepted the four crowns of Central Italy, the
people of which, during the long months of waiting, and under
circumstances that applied the most crucial test to their resolution, had
never swerved from the desire to form part of the Italian monarchy under
the sceptre of the <i>Re Galantuomo</i>. The King of Sardinia, as he was
still called, had eleven million subjects, and on his head rested one
excommunication the more. The Bull fulminated against all who had,
directly or indirectly, participated in the events which caused Romagna to
change hands, was published a day or two before the opening of the new
Parliament at Turin.</p>

<p>Addressing for the first time the representatives of his widened realm,
Victor Emmanuel said: 'True to the creed of my fathers, and, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg.265]</a></span> like them,
constant in my homage to the Supreme Head of the Church, whenever it
happens that the ecclesiastical authority employs spiritual arms in
support of temporal interests, I shall find in my steadfast conscience and
in the very traditions of my ancestors, the power to maintain civil
liberty in its integrity, and my own authority, for which I hold myself
accountable to God alone and to my people.'</p>

<p>The words: 'Della quale debbo ragione a Dio solo ed ai miei popoli,'
were added by the King to the speech prepared by his ministers; it was
noticed that he pronounced them with remarkable energy. The speech
concluded: 'Our country is no more the Italy of the Romans, nor the Italy
of the Middle Ages; no longer the field for every foreign ambition, it
becomes, henceforth, the Italy of the Italians.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h4>THE MARCH OF THE THOUSAND</h4>

<h5>1860</h5>

<h5>Origin of the Expedition&mdash;Garibaldi at
Marsala&mdash;Calatafimi&mdash;The Taking of
Palermo&mdash;Milazzo&mdash;The Bourbons evacuate Sicily.</h5>

<br />
<p>During the journey from Turin to Genoa, Garibaldi was occupied in
opening, reading and tearing up into small pieces an enormous mass of
letters, while his English companion spent the time in vainly speculating
as to what this vast correspondence was about. When they approached Genoa,
the floor of the railway carriage resembled a gigantic wastepaper basket.
It was only afterwards that Lawrence Oliphant guessed the letters to be
responses to a call for volunteers for Sicily.</p>

<p>The origin of the Sicilian expedition has been related in various ways;
there is the version which attributes it entirely to Cavour, and the
version which attributes it to not irresponsible personages in England.
The former was the French and Clerical official account; the latter has
always obtained credence in Germany and Russia. For instance, the late
Duke Ernest of Saxe-Coburg said that 'the mystery of how 150,000 men were
vanquished by a thousand Red-shirts was wrapped in English bank-notes!' Of
this theory, it need only be said that the notion of Lord Palmerston (for
it comes to that) supporting a foreign revolution out of the British
exchequer is not one that commends itself to the belief of the average
Englishman. With regard <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_267" id=
"Page_267">[Pg.267]</a></span> to the other theory&mdash;namely, that
Cavour 'got up' the Sicilian expedition, it has been favoured to a certain
degree, both by his friends and foes; but it will not bear careful
examination. As far as Sicily goes (Naples is another thing), the most
that can be brought home to Cavour is a complicity of toleration; and even
this statement should be qualified by the addition, 'after the act.' It is
true that, in the early days after Villafranca, he had exclaimed: 'They
have cut me off from making Italy from the north, by diplomacy; very well,
I will make her from the south, by revolution!' True, also, that earlier
still, in 1856, he expressed the opinion, shared by every man of common
sense, that while the Bourbons ruled over the Two Sicilies there would be
no real peace for Italy. Nevertheless, in April 1860, he neither thought
the time ripe for the venture nor the means employed adequate for its
accomplishment. He was afraid that Garibaldi would meet with the death of
the Bandieras and Pisacane. No one was more convinced than Cavour of the
importance of Garibaldi's life to Italy; and it is a sign of his true
superiority of mind that this conviction was never entertained more
strongly than at the moment when the general was passionately inveighing
against him for the cession of Nice. To Cavour such invectives seemed
natural, and even justified from one point of view; they excited in him no
bitterness, and he was only too happy that they fell upon himself and not
upon the King, since it was his fixed idea that, without the maintenance
of a good understanding between Victor Emmanuel and Garibaldi, Italy would
not be made. Few men under the sting of personal attacks have shown such
complete self-control.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">
[Pg.268]</a></span> As has been stated, when Francis II. ascended the
Neapolitan throne, he was invited to join in the war with Austria, and he
refused. Since then, the same negative result had attended the reiterated
counsels of reform which the Piedmontese Government sent to that of
Naples&mdash;the young King showing, by repeated acts, that not Sardinia
but Rome was his monitress and chosen ally in Italy. The Pope had lately
induced the French General Lamorici&egrave;re to take the command of the
Pontifical troops, and he and the King of Naples were organising their
armies, with a view to co-operating at an early date against the common
enemy at Turin. In January 1860, Lord Russell wrote to Mr Elliot, the
English Minister at Naples: 'You will tell the King and his Ministers that
the Government of her Majesty the Queen does not intend to accept any part
in the responsibility nor to guarantee the certain consequences of a
misgovernment which has scarcely a parallel in Europe.' Mr Elliot replied,
early in March: 'I have used all imaginable arguments to convince this
Government of the necessity of stopping short on the fatal path which it
has entered. I finished by saying that I was persuaded of the inevitable
fall of his Majesty and the dynasty if wiser counsels did not obtain a
hearing, and requested an audience with the King; since, when the
catastrophe occurs, I do not wish my conscience to reproach me with not
having tried all means of saving an inexperienced Sovereign from the ruin
which threatens him. The Ministers of France and Spain have spoken to the
same effect.' Even Russia advised Francis to make common cause with
Piedmont. In April, Victor Emmanuel wrote to his cousin, 'as a near
relative and an Italian Prince,' urging him to listen while there was yet
time to save something, if not everything. 'If you will not hear <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg.269]</a></span> me,'
he said, 'the day may come when I shall be obliged to be the instrument of
your ruin!' It has been said that the Sardinian Government, in tendering
similar advice, hoped for its refusal and contemplated the eventuality
hinted at with the reverse of apprehension. Of course this is true. Yet
the responsibility of declining to take the only course which might by any
possibility have saved him must rest with the King of Naples and not with
Victor Emmanuel and his Ministers. The attempt to make Francis appear the
innocent victim of a diabolical conspiracy will never succeed, however
ingenious are the writers who devote their abilities to so unfruitful a
task.</p>

<p>To trace the real beginning of the expedition we must go back to the
summer of 1859. When the war ended in the manner which he alone had
foreseen, Mazzini projected a revolutionary enterprise in the south which
should restore to the Italian movement its purely national character and
defeat in advance Napoleon's plans for gathering the Bourbon succession
for his cousin, Prince Murat. He sent agents to Sicily, and notably
Francesco Crispi, who, as a native of the island and a man of resource and
quick intelligence, was well qualified to execute the work of propaganda
and to elude the Bourbon police. Crispi travelled in all parts of Sicily
for several months, and in September he was able to report to Mazzini that
the insurrection might be expected in a few weeks&mdash;which proved
incorrect, but only as to date. Mazzini forbade his agents to agitate in
favour of a republic; unity was the sole object to be aimed at; unity in
whatever form and at whatever cost.</p>

<p>In March 1860 he had an interview in London with the man who was to
become the actual initiator of the revolutionary movement in South <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg.270]</a></span>
Italy. This was Rosalino Pilo, son of the Count di Capaci, and descended
through his mother from the royal house of Anjou, whose name, Italianised
into Gioeni, is still borne by several noble families in Sicily. Rosalino
Pilo, who was now in his fortieth year, had devoted all his life to his
country's liberties. After 1849, when he was obliged to leave Sicily, he
sold his ancestral acres to supply the wants of his fellow exiles, and
help the work of revolutionary propaganda. Handsome in person, cultivated
in mind, ready to give his life, as he had already given most of what
makes life tolerable, to the Italian cause, he won the affection of all
with whom he was brought in contact, and especially of Mazzini, from whom
he parted after that last interview radiant with hope, and yet with a
touch of sadness in his smile, as if in prevision that the place allotted
to him in the ranks of men was among the sowers, not among the
reapers.</p>

<p>Rosalino Pilo believed, as Mazzini believed, that Sicily was ripe for
revolution, but he realised the fact that under existing circumstances
there was an exceeding probability of a Sicilian revolution being rapidly
crushed. It was the tendency of Mazzini's mind to think the contrary; to
put more faith in the people themselves than in any leader or leaders; to
imagine that the blast of the trumpet of an angered population was
sufficient to bring down the walls of all the citadels of despotism,
however well furnished with heavy artillery. Pilo saw that there was only
one man who could give a real chance of success to a rising in his native
island, and that man was Garibaldi. As early as February he began to write
to Caprera, urging the general to give his co-operation to the projected
movement. It is notorious that the scheme, until almost the last moment,
did not find favour with Garibaldi. In spite of his perilous enterprises,
the chief had never been a courtier of failure, and he understood more
clearly than <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">
[Pg.271]</a></span> his correspondent what failure at that particular
juncture would have meant. The ventures of the Bandieras and of Pisacane,
similar in their general plan to the one now in view (though on a smaller
scale). ended in disasters, but disasters that were useful to Italy. A
disaster now would have been ruinous to Italy. Garibaldi's hesitations do
not, as some writers of the extreme party have foolishly assumed, detract
from his merit as victorious leader of the expedition; they only show him
to have been more amenable to political prudence than most people have
supposed.</p>

<p>Rosalino Pilo wrote, finally, that in any case he was determined to go
to Sicily himself to complete the preparations, and he added: 'The
insurrection in Sicily, consider it well, will carry with it that of the
whole south of the peninsula,' by which means not only would the Muratist
plots be frustrated, but also a new army and fleet would become available
for the conquest of independence and the liberation of Venetia. The writer
concluded by wishing the general 'new glories in Sicily in the
accomplishment of our country's redemption.'</p>

<p>True to his word Rosalino Pilo embarked at Genoa on the 24th of March,
on a crazy old coasting vessel, manned by five friendly sailors. He had
with him a single companion, and carried such arms and ammunition as he
had been able to get together. Terrible weather and the deplorable
condition of their craft kept them at sea for fifteen days, during which
time something of great importance happened at Palermo. On the 4th of
April the authorities became aware that arms and conspirators were
concealed in the convent of La Gancia, which was to have been the focus of
the revolution. Troops were sent to besiege the <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg.272]</a></span> convent, which they only
succeeded in taking after four hours' resistance; its fall was the signal
for a general slaughter of the inmates, both monks and laymen. The
insurrection was thus stifled in its birth in the capital, but from this
time it began to spread in the country, and when, at last, Rosalino Pilo
landed near Messina on the 10th of April, he found that several armed
bands were already roving the mountains, as yet almost unperceived by the
Government, which had gone to sleep again after its exhibition of energy
on the 4th. Events were, however, to awake it from its slumbers, and to
cause it to renew its vigilance. It required all Rosalino Pilo's skill and
courage to sustain the revolution of which he became henceforth the
responsible head, till the fated deliverer arrived.</p>

<p>Pilo's letters, brought back to Genoa by the pilot who guided him to
Sicilian waters, were what decided Garibaldi to go to the rescue. Some,
like Bixio and Bertani, warmly and persistently urged him to accept the
charge; others, like Sirtori, were convinced that the undertaking was
foredoomed, and that its only result would be the death of their beloved
captain: but this conviction did not lessen their eagerness to share his
perils when once he was resolved to go.</p>

<p>Like all born men of action, Garibaldi did not know what doubt was
after he came to a decision. From that moment his mental atmosphere
cleared; he saw the goal and went straight for it. In a surprisingly short
time the expedition was organised and ready to leave. 'Few and good,' had
been the rule laid down by Garibaldi for the enrolments; if he had chosen
he could have taken with him a much more numerous host. When it was the
day to start few they were (according to the most recent computation the
exact number was 1072 men), and they were <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg.273]</a></span> certainly good. The force was
divided into seven companies, the first entrusted to the ardent Nino
Bixio, who acted in a general way as second-in-command through both the
Sicilian and Neapolitan campaigns, and the seventh to Benedetto Cairoli,
whose mother contributed a large sum of money as well as three of her sons
to the freeing of Southern Italy. Sirtori, about whom there always clung
something of the priestly vocation for which he had been designed, was the
head of the staff; T&uuml;rr (the Hungarian) was adjutant-general. The
organisation was identical with that of the Italian army 'to which we
belong,' said Garibaldi in his first order of the day.</p>

<p>One name is missing, that of Medici, who was left behind to take the
command of a projected movement in the Papal States. By whom this plan was
invented is not clear, but simultaneous operations in different parts of
the peninsula had been always a favourite design of the more extreme
members of the Party of Action, and Garibaldi probably yielded to their
advice. All that came of it was the entry into Umbria of Zambianchi's
small band of volunteers, which was promptly repulsed over the frontier.
Medici, therefore, remained inactive till after the fall of Palermo; he
headed the second expedition of 4,000 volunteers which arrived in time to
take part in the final Sicilian battles.</p>

<p>Garibaldi's political programme was the cry of the Hunters of the Alps
in 1859: <i>Italy and Victor Emmanuel.</i> Those who were strict
republicans at heart, while abstaining from preaching the republic till
the struggle was over, would have stopped short at the first word <i>
Italy</i>. But Garibaldi told Rosalino Pilo, who was of this way of
thinking, that either he marched in the King's name or he did not march at
all. This was the condition of his acceptance, because he <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg.274]</a></span> esteemed it
the condition on which hung the success of the enterprise, nay more, the
existence of an united Italy.</p>

<p>The Thousand embarked at Quarto, near Genoa, during the night of the
5th of May on the two merchant vessels, the <i>Piemonte</i> and <i>
Lombardo</i>, which, with the complicity of their patriotic owner, R.
Rubattino, had been sequestered for the use of the expedition. On hearing
of Garibaldi's departure, Cavour ordered Admiral Persano, whose squadron
lay in the gulf of Cagliari, to arrest the expedition if the steamers
entered any Sardinian port, but to let it go free if they were encountered
on the high seas. Persano asked Cavour what he was to do if by stress of
storms Garibaldi were forced to come into port? The answer was that 'the
Ministry' decided for his arrest, which Persano rightly interpreted to
mean that Cavour had decided the contrary. He resolved, therefore, not to
stop him under any circumstances, but the case did not occur, for the
fairest of May weather favoured the voyage, and six days after the start
the men were quietly landed at Marsala without let or hindrance from the
two Neapolitan warships which arrived almost at the same time as the <i>
Piemonte</i> and <i>Lombardo</i>, an inconceivable stroke of good fortune
which, like the eventful march that was to follow, seems to belong far
more to romance than to history.</p>

<p>On the day before, the British gunboat <i>Intrepid</i> (Captain
Marryat), and the steam vessel <i>Argus</i>, had cast anchor in the
harbour of Marsala. Their presence was again and again spoken of by
Garibaldi as the key to the mystery of why he was not attacked. No matter
how it was done&mdash;it may have been a mere accident&mdash;but it can
hardly be doubted that the English men-of-war did practically cover the
landing of the Thousand. Lord John Russell denied emphatically to the
House of Commons that they were sent there for the purpose, as to this day
is <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">
[Pg.275]</a></span> believed by some grateful Italians, and by every
Clerical writer who handles the subject. The British Government had early
information of Italian revolutionary doings, just then, through Sir James
Hudson, who was in communication with men of all shades of opinion, and it
is credible that orders which must necessarily have been secret, were
given to afford a refuge on board English ships to the flying patriots in
the anticipated catastrophe. More than this is not credible, but the
energy shown by Captain Marryat in safeguarding the interests of the
British residents at Marsala caused the Neapolitan ships to delay opening
fire till the very last Red-shirt was out of harm's way on dry land. Then
and then only did they direct their guns on the <i>Piemonte</i> and <i>
Lombardo</i>, and fire a few shots into the city, which caused no other
damage than the destruction of two casks of wine.</p>

<p>On the 12th, Garibaldi left Marsala for Salemi, a mountain city
approached by a steep, winding ascent, where he was sure of a warm
reception, as it had already taken arms against the Bourbon king. Hence he
promulgated the decree by which he assumed the dictatorship of Sicily in
the name of Victor Emmanuel.</p>

<p>The Neapolitan army numbered from 120,000 to 130,000 men; of these
30,000 were actually in Sicily at the time the Thousand landed at Marsala,
18,000 being in and about Palermo, and the rest distributed over the
island. At Salemi, Garibaldi reviewed his united forces: he had been
joined by 200 fresh volunteers, and by a fluctuating mass of Sicilian
irregulars, which might be estimated to consist of 2,000 men, but it
increased or decreased along the road, because it was formed of peasants
of the districts traversed, who did not go far from their homes. These
undisciplined bands were not useless, as they gave the <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg.276]</a></span> Bourbon
generals the idea that Garibaldi had more men than he could ever really
count upon, and also the peasants knew the country well. When they came
under fire they behaved better than anyone would have expected. The first
batch joined the Thousand half-way between Marsala and Salemi. There might
have been fifty of them, dressed in goat-skins, and armed with the old
flint muskets and rusty pistols dear to the Sicilian heart, which he would
not for the world leave behind were he going no farther than to buy a lamb
at the fair. The feudal lord marched at the head of his uncouth
retainers&mdash;a company of bandits in an opera&mdash;yet, to Garibaldi,
they seemed the blessed assurance that this people whom he was come to
save was ready and willing to be saved. He received the poor little band
with as much rapture as if it had been a powerful army, and, in their
turn, the impressionable islanders were enraptured by the affability of
the man whom the population of Sicily soon came seriously to consider as a
new Messiah. It is a fact that the people of Southern Italy did believe
that Garibaldi had in him something superhuman, only the Bourbon troops
looked rather below than above for the source of it. The picturesque
incidents of the historic march were many; one other may be mentioned.
While the chief watered his horse at a spring a Franciscan friar threw
himself on his knees, and implored to be allowed to follow him. Some of
the volunteers thought the friar a traitor in disguise, but larger in
faith, Garibaldi said: 'Come with us, you will be our Ugo Bassi.' Fra
Pantaleo proved of no small use to the expedition.</p>

<p>A glance at the map makes clear the military situation. Garibaldi's
objective was Palermo, and if anything shows his genius as a Condottiere
it is this immediate determination to make straight for the capital where
the largest number of the enemy's troops was massed, <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg.277]</a></span> instead of
seeking an illusionary safety for his weak army in the open country. As
the crow flies the distance from Marsala to Palermo is not more than sixty
or seventy miles, but the routes being mountainous, the actual ground to
be covered is much longer. About midway lies Calatafimi, where all the
roads leading from the eastern coast to Palermo converge, and above it
towers the immensely strong position called Pianto dei Romani, from a
battle in which the Romans were defeated. These heights command a vast
prospect, and here General Landi, with 3,000 men and four pieces of
artillery, prepared to intercept the Garibaldians with every probability
of driving them back into the sea.</p>

<p>The royal troops took the offensive towards ten o'clock on the 15th of
May. They met the Red-shirts half way down the mountain, but were driven
up it again, inch by inch, till, at about three o'clock, they were back at
Pianto dei Romani. A final vigorous assault dislodged them from this
position, and they retreated in disorder to Calatafimi. Not wishing to
tempt fortune further for that day, Garibaldi bivouacqued on the field of
battle. In a letter written to Bertani, on the spur of the moment, he bore
witness with a sort of fatherly pride to the courage displayed by the
Neapolitans: 'It was the old misfortune,' he said, 'a fight between
Italians; but it proved to me what can be done with this family when
united. The Neapolitan soldiers, when their cartridges were exhausted,
threw stones at us in desperation.' How then, with much superior numbers
and a seemingly impregnable position, did they end in ignominious flight?
The answer may be found in the reply given to Bixio, bravest of the brave,
who <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">
[Pg.278]</a></span> yet feared, at one hotly-contested point, that retreat
was inevitable. 'Here,' retorted the chief,'we <i>die</i>.' Men who really
mean to conquer or die can do miracles.</p>

<p>The moral effect of the victory was tremendous. The world at large had
made absolutely sure of the destruction of the expedition. 'Garibaldi has
chosen to go his own way,' said Victor Emmanuel; 'but if you only knew the
fright I was in about him and the brave lads with him!' In Sicily, where
the insurrectionary activity of April was almost totally spent, the news
sent an electric shock of revolution through the whole island. In the
mountains Rosalino Pilo still resisted, weary of waiting for the help that
came not, discouraged or hopeless, but unyielding. Food and ammunition
were almost gone; his ragged band, held together only by the magnetism of
his personal influence, began to feel the pangs of hunger. A price was set
on his head, and he was harassed on all sides by the Neapolitan troops,
whose attacks became more frequent now that the Government realised that
there was danger. He knew nothing of Garibaldi's movements; but he was
resolved to keep his promise as long as he could: to hold out till the
chief came. At the hour when everything looked most desperate, a messenger
arrived in his camp with a letter in Garibaldi's handwriting, which bore
the date of the 16th of May. 'Yesterday,' it ran, we fought and
conquered.' Never was unexpected news more welcome. Filled with a joy such
as few men have tasted, Rosalino read the glad tidings to his men. 'The
cause is won,' he said. 'In a few days, if the enemy's balls respect me,
we shall be in Palermo.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile Garibaldi had occupied Calatafimi, and was proceeding towards
Monreale, from which side he contemplated a descent on the capital. On the
high tableland of Renda he met Rosalino Pilo with his <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg.279]</a></span> reanimated
band. That day the Garibaldian army, all told, amounted to 5,000 men. On
the 21st of May, Rosalino was ordered to make a reconnaissance in the
direction of Monreale; while carrying out this order a Neapolitan bullet
struck his forehead, causing almost instantaneous death. 'I am happy to be
able to give my blood to Italy, but may heaven be propitious once for
all,' he had written when he first landed, words realised to the
letter.</p>

<p>The Neapolitans were put in high spirits by Rosalino Pilo's death; the
discomfiture of Calatafimi was forgotten; they represented Garibaldi as a
mouse that was obligingly walking into a well-laid trap. In fact, his
position could not have been more critical, but he had recourse to a
stratagem which saved him. He succeeded in placing the enemy upon a
completely false scent. Abandoning the idea of reaching Palermo from the
east (Monreale), he decided to attempt the assault from the south (Piana
de' Greci and Misilimeri), but, all the while, he continued to throw the
Sicilian <i>Picciotti</i> on the Monreale route, and gave them orders to
fire stray shots in every direction and to light innumerable camp-fires.
These troops frequently came in contact with the Neapolitans in trifling
skirmishes, and kept their attention so well occupied that General
Colonna, in command of the force sent in search of the 'Filibuster,' did
not doubt that the whole Garibaldian army was concentrated over Monreale.
Garibaldi rapidly moved his own column by night to its new base of
operations. The ground was steep and difficult, and a storm raged all the
night; fifteen years later he declared that none of his marches in the
virgin forests of America was so arduous as this. While the Neapolitans
remained in ignorance of these changes, three English naval officers,
guided by a sort of sporting dog's instinct, happened to be driving
through the village of <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_280" id=
"Page_280">[Pg.280]</a></span> Misilmeri just after Garibaldi established
his headquarters in that neighbourhood. Of course it was by chance; still,
Misilmeri is an odd place to go for an afternoon drive, and the escapade
ended in the issue of a severe warning to Her Majesty's officers and
marines to keep in future 'within the bounds of the sentinels of the royal
troops.' Luckily record exists of the experiences of Lieutenant Wilmot and
his two companions at Misilmeri. Garibaldi, on hearing that three English
naval officers were in the village, sent to invite them to the vineyard
where he was taking his dinner. They found him standing in a large
enclosure in the midst of a group of followers who all, like himself, wore
the legendary red flannel shirt and grey trousers. Fra Pantaleo's brown
habit formed the only exception. Several Hungarian officers were present,
and by his father stood Menotti, then a stout youth of nineteen, with his
arm in a sling from the severe wound he received at Calatafimi. Around
were soldiers who looked like mere boys. They gazed with delight on the
English uniforms. Garibaldi requested his guests to be seated and to
partake of some freshly-gathered strawberries. He spoke of his affection
and respect for England, and said it was his hope soon to make the
acquaintance of the British admiral. He mentioned how he had seen and
admired from the heights the beautiful effect of the salutes fired in
honour of the Queen's birthday, two days before. He then retired into his
tent, made of an old blanket stretched over pikes; a child, under the name
of a sentry, paced before it to keep off the crowd.</p>

<p>To complete the deception of the enemy the Garibaldian artillery, under
Colonel Orsini, was ordered to make a retrograde march on Corleone
previous to joining the main force at Misilmeri. Orsini narrowly escaped
getting caught while executing this movement, and for <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg.281]</a></span> the sake of
celerity was obliged to throw his five cannon (including one taken at
Calatafimi) down deep water courses. He returned to pull them out again
when the immediate danger was past. General Colonna, who followed him
closely, was convinced that the whole of the Garibaldians were in
disorderly retreat as witnessed by the mules and waggons purposely
abandoned by Orsini along the route. For four days Colonna believed that
he had Garibaldi flying before him, and sent intelligence to that effect
to Naples, whence it was published through the world. On the fifth day he
was immeasurably surprised by hearing that Garibaldi had entered
Palermo!</p>

<p>It was at early dawn on Whitsunday, the 27th of May, that Garibaldi
reached the threshold of the capital, and after overcoming the guard at
Ponte dell' Ammiraglio, pushed on to Porta Termini, the strategic key to
the city. The royalists, though taken by surprise in the first instance,
had time to dispose a strong force behind walls and barricades before
Garibaldi could reach the gate, and it required two hours of severe
fighting to take the position. Many Red-shirts were killed, and Benedetto
Cairoli received the severe wound from which he never wholly recovered.
Success, however, was complete, and the Palermitans got up to find, to
their frantic joy, the Liberator within their gates. According to the old
usage their first impulse was to run to the belfries in order to sound the
tocsin, but they found that the royalists had removed the clappers of the
bells. Nothing daunted, they beat the bells all day with hammers and other
implements, and so produced an indescribable noise which had a material
influence on the nerves of the terrified Neapolitan troops. Being
disarmed, the only other help which the inhabitants could render to their
deliverers was the erection of barricades.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">
[Pg.282]</a></span> Even after Garibaldi's entry, it is thought that
General Lanza could have crushed him in the streets by sheer force of
superiority in numbers and artillery had he made proper use of his means.
However, at about three p.m., he chose the less heroic plan of ordering
the castle and the Neapolitan fleet to bombard the city. Most of his staff
opposed the decision, and one officer broke his sword, but Lanza was
inexorable. The measure so exasperated the Palermitans that even had it
achieved its end for the moment, never after would they have proved
governable from Naples. Thirteen hundred shells were thrown into the city.
Lord Palmerston denounced the bombardment and its attendant horrors as
'unworthy of our time and of our civilisation.' The soldiers helped the
work by setting fire to some quarters of the city. Among the spots where
the shells fell in most abundance was the convent of the Sette Angeli. The
Garibaldians escorted the nuns to a place of safety and carried their more
valuable possessions after them. The good sisters were charmed by the
courtesy with which the young Italians performed these duties.</p>

<p>Fighting in the streets went on more or less continuously, and the
liberators kept their ground, but every hour brought fresh perils. A
Bavarian regiment arrived to reinforce General Lanza, and the return of
the Neapolitan column from Corleone was momentarily expected. The
Garibaldians, and this was the gravest fact of all, had used almost their
last cartridge. The issue of the struggle was awaited with varying
sentiments on board the English, French, Austrian, Spanish and Sardinian
warships at anchor in the bay. Admiral Mundy had placed his squadron so
close to the land that the ships were in danger of suffering from the
bombardment, a course attributed to the humane <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg.283]</a></span> desire to afford a
refuge for non-combatants, and in fact, the officers were soon engaged in
entertaining a frightened crowd of ladies and children. The <i>
Intrepid</i> in particular, was so near the Marina that a fair swimmer
could have reached it in a few minutes; nobody guessed, least of all
Garibaldi, that her mission in the mind of the British admiral was to save
the chiefs own life in what seemed the likely case of its being placed in
peril.</p>

<p>Admiral Mundy begged the authorities to stop the bombardment before the
city was destroyed, but Lanza appeared to have no intention of yielding to
his counsels, and it is still uncertain what at last induced him on the
30th of May to sue the Filibuster, hastily transformed into his
Excellency, for an armistice of twenty-four hours. 'God knows,' writes
Garibaldi, 'if we had want of it!' The royalists had lost nearly the whole
city except the palace and its surroundings, and, cut off from the sea,
they began to feel a scarcity of food, but not to a severe extent. It
seems most probable that with his men panic-stricken and constantly driven
back in spite of the bombardment, Lanza looked upon the game as lost, when
had he known the straits to which the Garibaldians were reduced for
ammunition, he might have considered it as won.</p>

<p>An unforeseen incident now occurred; the royalist column, recalled from
Corleone, which was largely composed of Bavarians, reached Porta Termini
and opened a furious fire on the weak Garibaldian detachment stationed
there. Was it ignorance or bad faith? Lieutenant Wilmot, who happened to
be passing by, energetically waved his handkerchief and shouted that a
truce was concluded; the assailants continued the attack till an officer
of the Neapolitan staff who was in conference with Garibaldi at the time
hurried to the spot, at his indignant <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg.284]</a></span> request, and ordered them to
desist. A few minutes later, Garibaldi himself rode up in a wrathful mood,
and while he was renewing his protests, a shell fell close by him, thrown
from a ship which re-opened the bombardment on its own account. Lieutenant
Wilmot, who witnessed the whole affair, was convinced that there was a
deliberate plan to surprise and capture the Italian chief after he had
granted the armistice.</p>

<p>At a quarter past two on this eventful day, the 30th of May 1860,
Garibaldi and the Neapolitan generals, Letizia and Chretien, stepped on
board the flag-ship <i>Hannibal</i> which Admiral Mundy offered as neutral
ground for their meeting. Curiously enough, both parties, reaching the
mole simultaneously, were rowed out in the same ship's boat, which was
waiting in readiness. The Neapolitans insisted that Garibaldi should go on
board first, either from courtesy or, as the admiral suspected, out of
desire to find out whether he would be received with military honours.
With instinctive tact he had donned his old and rather shabby uniform of a
major-general in the Sardinian army; the admiral's course was, therefore,
marked out, and Garibaldi received the same salute as the two generals who
followed him. After a foolish attempt on the part of the Neapolitan
officers to make themselves disagreeable, which was repressed with
dignified decision by Admiral Mundy, business began, and things went
smoothly till the fifth article of the proposed convention came under
discussion: 'That the municipality should direct a humble petition to his
Majesty the King expressing the real wants of the city.' 'No,' cried
Garibaldi, starting to his feet, 'the time for humble petitions to the
King, or to anyone else, is past; I am the municipality, and I refuse.'
General Letizia grew excited at this declaration, but afterwards he agreed
to <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">
[Pg.285]</a></span> submit the question of quashing the fifth article to
his chief, General Lanza. The armistice was prolonged till nine the next
morning.</p>

<p>As soon as he was back on shore, Garibaldi issued a manifesto, in which
he announced that he had refused a proposal dishonouring the city, and
that to-morrow, at the close of the armistice, he should renew
hostilities. There was a splendid audacity in the threat; his powder was
literally exhausted; nothing was left for him to do but to die with all
his men, and to do this he and they were unquestionably ready. The conduct
of the citizens was on a level with the occasion. As soon as the manifesto
came to be known, the inhabitants rushed to the Palazzo Pretorio, where
the man who had so proudly answered in their name, addressed them in these
terms: 'People of Palermo; the enemy has made me propositions which I
judged humiliating to you, and knowing that you are ready to bury
yourselves under the ruins of your city, I refused.' Those who were
present say that never did Garibaldi seem so great as at that moment. The
answer was one deafening shout, in which the women and children joined, of
'War! war!' In the evening the city was illuminated as on a feast-day.</p>

<p>Once more in history, the game of greatly daring succeeded. Appalled by
the reports of the dreadful threats emanating from a population without
arms, and a handful of volunteers without powder, distrustful henceforth
of the courage of his soldiers, and, if the truth must be told, of the
fidelity of his fleet, Lanza sent General Letizia to Garibaldi betimes, on
the 31st of May, with an unconditional demand for the continuance of the
armistice. A convention was drawn up, which conceded the fullest liberty
to the royalists to supply their material wants, succour the wounded, and,
if they desired, embark <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_286" id=
"Page_286">[Pg.286]</a></span> them on board ships with their families for
Naples. Garibaldi, always humane, had a special tenderness for the victims
of that civil strife which his soul abhorred, and he never forgot that the
enemy was his fellow-countryman. His influence sufficed to secure to the
royal troops an immunity from reprisals which was the more creditable
because some horrid crimes had been done by miscreants in their ranks when
they found that they were getting the worst of it in the street-fighting.
Unfortunately the same mercy was not extended to some of the secret agents
of Maniscalco, head of the Sicilian police, who, discovered in
hiding-places by the mob, were murdered before any protection could be
given them. At the time the act of barbarity was judged, even by English
observers, with more leniency than it deserved (because cruelty can have
<i>no</i> excuse), so great was the disgust excited by the most odious
system of espionage ever put in practice.</p>

<p>The convention bore the signatures of 'Ferdinando Lanza,
General-in-Chief,' and of 'Francesco Crispi, Secretary of State to the
Provisional Government of Sicily.' One article provided for the
consignment of the Royal Mint to the victors; a large sum was stored in
its coffers, and Garibaldi found himself in the novel position of being
able to pay his men and the Sicilian <i>squadre</i>, and to send large
orders for arms and ammunition to the Continent.</p>

<p>General Letizia made two journeys to Naples, and on his return from the
second he came invested with full powers to treat with Garibaldi for the
evacuation of the city. On the 7th of June, 15,000 royal troops marched
down to the Marina to the ships that were to take them away. At the
entrance of the Toledo, the great main street of Palermo, Menotti
Garibaldi was on guard, on a prancing black charger, with a <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg.287]</a></span> few other
Red-shirts of his own age around him, and before this group of boys
defiled the might and pomp of the disciplined army to which King Bomba had
given the thoughtful care of a life-time.</p>

<p>The closing formalities which wound up these events at Palermo formed a
fitting ending to the dramatic scenes which have been briefly narrated. On
the 19th, General Lanza went on board the <i>Hannibal</i> to take leave of
the British admiral. He was covered with decorations and attended by his
brilliant personal staff. There, in the beautiful bay, lay the ship on
board which he was to sail at sunset, and twenty-four steam transports
were also there, each filled with Neapolitan troops. The defeated general
was deeply moved as he walked on to the quarter-deck. 'We have been
unfortunate,' he said&mdash;words never spoken by one officer of
unquestioned personal courage to another without striking a responsive
chord. When he quitted the <i>Hannibal</i>, the English admiral ordered
the White Flag of the King of the Two Sicilies to be hoisted at the
foretop-gallant masthead for the last time in Sicilian waters; and a
salute of nineteen guns, the salute due to the direct representative or
<i>alter ego</i> of a sovereign, speeded the parting guest. Thus, wrapped
in the dignity of misfortune, vanished the last semblance of the graceless
and treacherous thraldom of the Spanish Bourbons in the capital of Sicily.
The flag of Italy was run up on the tower of the Semaphore. Everywhere the
revolution triumphed except at Messina, Milazzo and Syracuse. Even
Catania, where a rising had been put down after a sanguinary struggle, was
now evacuated and left to itself.</p>

<p>So the 20th of June dawned, and the Queen's ships in the harbour put
forth all their bravery of flags in commemoration of her accession, which
display was naturally interpreted by the Palermitans as a <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg.288]</a></span> compliment
to the Dictator, who had fixed that day for calling on the British, French
and Sardinian admirals and on the captain of the United States frigate <i>
Iroquois</i>. With what honours the American captain received him is not
recorded; for certain it was with cordial goodwill; of the others, Admiral
Mundy treated him as on the previous occasion; the French admiral affected
to consider him a 'simple monsieur' who had unexpectedly come to call,
whilst Admiral Persano, on board the <i>Maria Adelaide</i>, gave him a
salute of nineteen guns, which formed a virtual recognition on the part of
Piedmont of his assumption of the dictatorship. Cavour had ordered Persano
to act on his own responsibility as the exigencies of the hour demanded,
and the admiral knew that these vague instructions assigned him a more
vigorous policy than the other ministers would have agreed to officially.
His bold initiative was therefore justified. As some severe words will
have to be said of Persano in a later chapter, it is well to remark here
that during his Sicilian command he behaved like a thorough patriot,
although it was not in his power to render such great moral services to
freedom as were undoubtedly rendered by Admiral Mundy, who at the same
time acted with so much tact that his neutrality was not impugned, and he
even won the equal personal gratitude of both parties. On the other hand,
the Austrian commodore, Baron von W&uuml;llersdorf, succeeded in pleasing
no one and no one pleased him. He did not expect that the Garibaldians
would lose much love to him, but he took it unkindly that the royalists
fired at his boat with himself in it, and the Austrian flag at the stern.
In high dudgeon he related this grievance to his British colleague, who
gently suggested that since Austria had always supported the Bourbon
system of Government, it was hardly strange if the royalists were hurt at
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg.289]</a></span>
receiving neither assistance nor even sympathy from the Austrian squadron
which witnessed their destruction. The remark was acute; even Austria was,
in fact, tired of the Bourbons of Naples; a portent of their not distant
doom. But it was not likely that the royalists should appreciate the
phlegmatic attitude of their erewhile protectors.</p>

<p>The concluding military operations in Sicily presented a more arduous
task than, in the first flush of success, might have been anticipated. In
the general panic, one, if one only, royalist officer, Colonel Del Bosco,
turned round and stood at bay. His spirited course was not far from
undoing all that had been done. Fortunately Garibaldi had received
important reinforcements. General Medici touched the Sicilian shores three
days after the evacuation of Palermo with 3500 volunteers, well-armed and
equipped out of the so-called 'Million Rifle Fund,' which was formed by
popular subscription in the north of Italy. The Dictator went as far as
Alcamo to meet the hero of the last glorious fight of Rome, whom he
greeted with delight and affection. Later, arrived the third and last
expedition, consisting of 1500 men under Cosenz, till recently
commander-in-chief of the Italian army. The Sicilian <i>squadre</i> had
been brought into something like military organisation; and an Englishman,
Colonel Dunne, had raised a picked corps of 400 Palermitans which
contained, besides its commander, between thirty and forty of his
countrymen, and was hence called the English Regiment. This battalion was
ready to do anything and go anywhere; it performed excellent work both in
Sicily and on the mainland.<a name="FNanchor5"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">
[Pg.290]</a></span> Garibaldi arranged his forces in three divisions; one,
under T&uuml;rr, was sent to Catania; the second, under Bixio, to
Girgenti; the third, under Medici, was to follow the northern sea-coast
towards Messina, the strongest position still in the enemy's hands. All
three were ultimately to converge with a view to the grand object of
crossing over to the mainland. Medici had 2500 men; the royalists in and
about Messina could dispose of 15,000. The Garibaldians did not expect
much opposition till they got near Messina, but when they reached
Barcelona they heard that the garrison of Milazzo had been reinforced by
Del Bosco with 4000 men, with the evident design of cutting off their
passage to Messina. It is said that this move was made in consequence of
direct communications between that officer and Francis II., whose
ministers had already decided to abandon the whole island. But Del Bosco
secretly assured his King that such a measure was not necessary, and that
he would undertake not only to bar Medici's advance, but to march over the
dead bodies of the Garibaldians to Palermo. Milazzo is a small hilly
peninsula, on which stands a fort and a little walled city. The spot was
well chosen. On the 17th of <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_291" id=
"Page_291">[Pg.291]</a></span> July, Del Bosco attacked the Garibaldian
right, and it was not without difficulty that Medici retained his
positions. Some further reinforcements were sent to Del Bosco from
Messina, though not so numerous as they ought to have been, but they would
have almost ensured him the victory had not Medici also received help;
Cosenz' column, and, yet more important, Garibaldi himself with the 1000
men he had kept in Palermo, hastening at full speed to the rescue. The
belligerents were, for once, about equally balanced in numbers when on the
20th of July Garibaldi attacked Del Bosco with the purpose of driving him
on to the tongue of the peninsula, thus cutting him off from Messina and
leaving the road open. A desperate engagement followed. The Neapolitans
showed that they could fight if they were properly led, and inflicted a
loss of 800 in killed and wounded (heavy out of a total of 5000) on their
gallant opponents. Garibaldi's own life was nearly sacrificed. He was
standing in a field of prickly pears in conversation with Major Missori
when a party of the enemy's cavalry rode up, the captain of which dealt a
violent blow at him with his sword, without knowing who it was. Garibaldi
coolly parried the blow, and struck down his assailant, while Missori shot
the three nearest dragoons with his revolver. Hearing the noise, other
Garibaldians hurried up, and the chief was saved. For a long time the
issue of the battle remained uncertain, and it was only after hours of
severe fighting that Del Bosco was compelled to recognise his defeat, and
to take refuge on the projecting strip of land as Garibaldi had meant that
he should do.</p>

<p>A few days later, four transports arrived in the bay of Milazzo to
carry Del Bosco and his men to Naples. The ministry had prevailed, and the
complete abandonment of the island was decreed. General Clary, <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg.292]</a></span>
commandant of Messina, informed Garibaldi that he had orders to evacuate
the town and its outlying forts; the citadel would be also handed over if
the Dictator would engage not to cross to the mainland, but this
conditional offer was declined. The citadel of Messina therefore remained
in the power of the royalists, but on agreement that it should not resume
hostilities unless attacked. It only capitulated in March 1861. Garibaldi
reigned over the rest of the island. The convention was signed on the 28th
of July by Marshal Tommaso de Clary for the King of Naples, and
Major-General Giacomo Medici for the Dictator.</p>

<p>Before following Garibaldi across the Straits, some allusion is called
for to the general political situation both in Sicily and in Italy. And
first as regards Sicily. When a government is pulled down another must be
set up, and the last task is often not the easiest. Garibaldi appointed a
ministry in which the ruling spirit was Francesco Crispi. A Sicilian
patriot from his youth, and one of the Thousand, he has been judged the
man best fitted to direct the helm of United Italy in days of unexampled
difficulty. This is enough to prove that he was not the first-come
ignoramus or madman that some people then liked to think him. But Crispi
had the art of making enemies, nor has he lost it. Though volumes have
been written on the civil administration under the dictatorship, the
writers' judgments are so warped by their political leanings that it is
not easy to get at the truth. It would have been strange had no confusion
existed, had no false steps been made; yet some of the old English
residents in Sicily say that the island made more real progress during the
few months of Garibaldi's reign than in all the years that have followed.
Towards the end of <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">
[Pg.293]</a></span> June, Garibaldi appointed Agostino Depretis as
Pro-Dictator. Of the many decrees formulated and measures adopted at this
period, Garibaldi, who had many other things to think of, was personally
responsible only for those of a philanthropic nature. Busy as he was, he
found time to inquire minutely into the State of the population of
Palermo, and he was horrified at the ignorance and misery in which the
poorer classes were plunged. Forthwith, out came a bushel-basket of edicts
and appeals on behalf of these poor children of the sun. He visited the
orphan asylum and found that eighty per cent. of the inmates died of
starvation. One nurse had to provide for the wants of four infants.
Garibaldi wrote off an address to the ladies of Palermo, in which he
implored them to interest themselves in the wretched little beings created
in the image of God, at the sight of whose wasted and puny bodies he, an
old soldier, had wept. He had money and food distributed every morning to
the most destitute, at the gates of the royal palace, where he lived with
a frugality that scandalised the aged servants of royalty whom he kept,
out of kindness, at their posts. Theoretically, he disapproved of
indiscriminate almsgiving, but in the misery caused by the recent
bombardment, such theories could not be strictly applied, or, at any rate,
Garibaldi was not the man to so apply them; whence it happened that
though, as <i>de facto</i> head of the State, he allowed himself a civil
list of eight francs a day, the morning had never far advanced before his
pockets were empty, and he had to borrow small sums from his friends,
which next morning were faithfully repaid.</p>

<p>When he walked about the town, the women pressed forward to touch the
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg.294]</a></span>
hem of his <i>poncho</i>, and made their children kneel to receive his
blessing. On one occasion a convent of nuns, from the youngest novice to
the elderly abbess, insisted on giving him the kiss of peace. An idolatry
which would have made anyone else ridiculous; but Garibaldi, being
altogether simple and unselfconscious, was above ridicule. One of the good
works that he initiated was the transformation of the Foundling Hospital,
of which the large funds were turned to little account, into a Military
School under the direction of his best officers. In less than a month the
school could turn out two smart battalions, and there were few mornings
that the Dictator did not go to watch the boys at their drill. He
encouraged them with the promise that before long he would lead them
himself to the wars.</p>

<p>Such actions smell sweeter from the dust, than the old story of the
antagonism that sprang up in those days between Garibaldi and Cavour,
between Crispi and La Farina. This dualism, as it was called, was the
fruit of a mutual distrust, which, however much to be deplored, was not to
be avoided. Although Cavour had a far juster idea of Garibaldi than that
entertained by his <i>entourage</i>, he was nevertheless haunted by the
fear that the general's revolutionary friends would persuade him to depart
from his programme of 'Italy and Victor Emmanuel,' and embark upon some
adventure of a republican complexion. He was also afraid that the
Government of the Dictator would, by its unconventional methods, discredit
the Italian cause in the eyes of European statesmen. These reasons caused
him to desire and to endeavour to bring about the immediate annexation of
Sicily to the Sardinian kingdom. On the other hand, Garibaldi's faith in
Cavour had <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">
[Pg.295]</a></span> ceased with the cession of Nice, and he believed him
to be even now contemplating the cession of the island of Sardinia as a
further sop to Cerberus&mdash;a project which, if it existed nowhere else,
did exist in the mind of Napoleon III. With regard to immediate
annexation, he had no intention of agreeing to it, and for one sufficing
reason: had he consented he could not have carried the war of liberation
across the Straits of Messina. His Sicilian army must have laid down their
arms at a command from Turin were it given. And it would have been
given.</p>

<p>La Farina, like Crispi, a Sicilian by birth, arrived suddenly at
Palermo, representing Cavour, as everyone thought, but in reality he
represented himself. Strong-willed and prejudiced, he was, in his own way,
a perfectly good patriot, and he had done all that was in his power
(though not quite so much as in later years he fancied that he had done)
to aid and further the expedition of the Thousand. But he tried to force
the annexation scheme by means so openly hostile to the government of the
day, that Garibaldi at length sent him on board Persano's flag-ship with a
request that the admiral would forward him to Turin.</p>

<p>After the evacuation of Messina by the royal troops, Garibaldi received
persuasions of all sorts to let the kingdom of Naples alone. On the part
of King Francis an offer was made to him of 50,000,000 francs and the
Neapolitan navy in aid of a war for the liberation of Venice. Almost
simultaneously he received a letter from Victor Emmanuel sent by the hand
of Count Giulio Litta, in which the writer said that in the event of the
King of Naples giving up Sicily 'I think that our most reasonable course
would be to renounce all ulterior undertakings against the Neapolitan
kingdom.' This was the first <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_296" id=
"Page_296">[Pg.296]</a></span> direct communication between the King and
Garibaldi since the latter's landing at Marsala; it is to be surmised that
of indirect communications there had been several, and that they took the
form of substantial assistance, sent, probably without Cavour being aware
of it, for Victor Emmanuel carried on his own little conspiracies with a
remarkable amount of secrecy. What induced him now to address words of
restraint to Garibaldi in the midway of his work, was the arrival of a
letter from Napoleon III. in which the Emperor urged him in the strongest
manner to use his well-known personal influence with the general to hold
him back. It was not easy for Victor Emmanuel to refuse point blank to
make the last effort on behalf of his cousin. Francis had appointed a
constitutional ministry, promised a statute, granted an amnesty and
engaged to place himself in accord with the King of Sardinia, adopted even
the tricolor flag with the royal arms of Bourbon in the centre.
Concessions idle as desperate on the 25th of June 1860, the date which
they bore. Their only consequence then was to facilitate the fall of the
dynasty, the usual result of similar inspirations of the eleventh hour.
Had all this been done on the day of the King's accession it might have
imperilled Italian unity&mdash;not now. But the fatal words, 'Too late,'
would have fallen with ill grace from Victor Emmanuel's lips. Garibaldi
answered his royal correspondent that when he had made him King of Italy
he would be only too happy to obey him for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>The King's letter, though delivered after the battle of Milazzo, was
written before it. That event convinced Cavour, and doubtless the King
with him, that it was utterly impossible to arrest the tide at Cape Faro.
It convinced him of a great deal more. He saw that if Piedmont <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg.297]</a></span>
continued much longer a passive spectator of the march of events, she
would lose the lead forever And he prepared to act.</p>

<p>Meanwhile counsels reached Garibaldi from quite a different quarter not
to abandon Naples, but to go there from Rome instead of by Calabria. This
daring scheme was favoured by Mazzini, Nicotera, Bertani; indeed, by all
the republicans. A corps of about 8000 volunteers was ready to start for a
descent on the coast of the Papal States. At present it was in the island
of Sardinia, awaiting the arrival of Garibaldi to assume the command. And
now occurred Garibaldi's mysterious disappearance from Cape Faro, which at
the time excited endless curiosity. The truth was, that he actually went
to Sardinia, but instead of taking command of the volunteers bound for
Rome, he induced them to alter their plans and to join his Sicilian army
in the arduous undertaking before it of overthrowing the Bourbons in the
Neapolitan kingdom. Thus he gained a reinforcement of which he knew the
enormous need, for though he was willing to face difficulties, he was not
blind to them, as were many men of the extreme party. He also prevented
what would have been a step of exceeding danger to the national cause, as
it would have obliged the Sardinian Government to break off all relations
with Garibaldi and to use force against the patriots in suppressing a
movement which, if successful, would have brought a hostile French army
into Italy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<h4>THE MEETING OF THE WATERS</h4>

<h5>1860</h5>

<h5>Garibaldi's March on Naples&mdash;The Piedmontese in Umbria and the
Marches&mdash;The Volturno&mdash;Victor Emmanuel enters Naples.</h5>

<br />
<p>The Italian kingdom is the fruit of the alliance between the strong
monarchical principles of Piedmont and the dissolvent forces of
revolution. Whenever either one side or the other, yielding to the
influence of its individual sympathies or prejudices, failed to recognise
that thus only, by the essential logic of events, could the unity of the
country be achieved, the entire edifice was placed in danger of falling to
the ground before it was completed.</p>

<p>When Garibaldi stood on Cape Faro, conqueror and liberator, clothed in
a glory not that of Wellington or Moltke, but that of Arthur or Roland or
the Cid Campeador; the subject of the gossip of the Arabs in their tents,
of the wild horsemen of the Pampas, of the fishers in ice-bound seas; a
solar myth, nevertheless certified to be alive in the nineteenth
century&mdash;Cavour understood that if he were left much longer single
occupant of the field, either he would rush to disaster, which would be
fatal to Italy, or he would become so powerful that, in the event of his
being plunged, willingly or unwillingly, by the more ardent apostles of
revolution into opposition with the King of Sardinia, the issue of the
contest would be by no means sure. To guard <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg.299]</a></span> against both possibilities,
Cavour decided to act, and to act at once. He said of the conjuncture in
which he was placed that it was not one of the most difficult, but the
most difficult of his political life. But he proved equal to the task,
which does the more honour to his statesmanship because his first plan
failed completely. This plan was, that the Neapolitan population should
overthrow Francis II., and proclaim Victor Emmanuel their King before
Garibaldi crossed the Straits. But the Neapolitans would not move hand or
foot till Garibaldi was among them. The fact that when Cavour was
convinced that the Bourbon dynasty at Naples was about to fall, he tried
to hasten its collapse by a few weeks or days, was made the most of by his
enemies as an example of base duplicity. At this distance of time, it need
only be said that whether his conduct of affairs was scrupulous or
unscrupulous, it deceived no one, for the Neapolitan King and his friends
were well convinced that the Filibuster of Caprera was their less deadly
foe than the Prime Minister of Piedmont.</p>

<p>But of all the foes of Franceschiello, to use the diminutive by which,
half in pity, half in contempt, the people of Naples remember him, the
most irrevocably fatal was himself. Two courses were open to him when,
after losing Sicily, he saw the loss of his other kingdom and of his
throne staring him in the face. One was to go forth like a man at the head
of his troops to meet the storm. There had been such a thing as loyalty in
the Kingdom of Naples; not loyalty of the highest sort, but still the
sentiment had existed. Who knows what might not have been the effect of
the presence of their young Sovereign on the broken <i>moral</i> of the
Neapolitan soldiers? 'Sire, place yourself at the head <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg.300]</a></span> of the
40,000 who remain, and risk a last stake, or, at least, fall gloriously
after an honourable battle,' was the advice given him by his minister of
war, Pianell. But his stepmother or somebody (certainly not his wife) said
that the sacred life of a king ought to be kept in cotton wool, like other
curiosities. Meanwhile his uncle, the Count of Syracuse, proposed the
other course which, though not heroic, would have been intelligible and
even patriotic. This was to absolve his subjects from their obedience, and
embark on the first available ship for foreign parts. Fitting the action
to the word, the Count himself started for Turin. Francis awaited the doom
of those who only know how to take half measures.</p>

<p>The demoralisation, not only of the troops but of every branch of the
public administration in the kingdom of Naples, was not yet a certified
fact; and the enterprise which Garibaldi at Cape Faro had before him, of
invading the dominions of a monarch who still had a large army, and whose
subjects showed not the slightest visible sign of being disposed to strike
a blow for their own freedom, looked rather fabulous than difficult. The
only part of the <i>Regno</i> where the people were taking action was in
the furthermost region of Calabria; a fortunate circumstance, since it was
the first point to be attacked. Calabria, which had contributed its quota
to the Thousand, contained more patriotic energy than the rest of the <i>
Regno</i> put together. On the 8th of August, Garibaldi sent over a small
vanguard of 200 men under a Calabrian officer, with the order to join the
Calabrian band of insurgents which was hiding in the woods and gorges of
Aspromonte, and to spread the news that his own coming would not be long
delayed. The Neapolitan generals had acquired the idea that, instead of
these <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">
[Pg.301]</a></span> few men, a large force had already disembarked, and so
turned their attention to the mountains; while Garibaldi, after throwing
the war-ships in the Straits on an equally false scent by various
intentionally abortive operations, crossed in the night of the 19th and
effected a landing not far from Reggio, of which, for both moral and
strategic reasons, it was of vital importance to gain possession as soon
as possible. He took with him 4500 men, and had between 14,000 and 15,000
more in readiness to follow. The royalist army in Calabria numbered about
27,000, including the garrison of Reggio, 2000 men, under the command of
General Galotti. On the 20th, Bixio attacked the outposts; and on the
21st, Garibaldi fought his way into the city&mdash;not, however, without
meeting a strong resistance on the part of the garrison, which might have
been continued longer, and even with a different result, had not the
Calabrian insurgents hurried down from Aspromonte on hearing the sound of
guns, their sudden appearance making the Royalists think that they were
being attacked on all sides. Next day the castle surrendered, and thus a
quantity of valuable war material fell into Garibaldi's hands. His luck
had not deserted him.</p>

<p>Cosenz and Medici landed their divisions in the night of the 21st of
August, near Scilla, in the neighbourhood of which General Briganti had
massed his Neapolitans, 7000 strong. On the 23rd, Briganti found himself
attacked on the south and north&mdash;from Scilla by Cosenz, and from
Reggio by Garibaldi. His position was critical but not desperate had he
been able to depend upon his men, who were more numerous than their
combined opponents; but he saw at once that fighting was the <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg.302]</a></span> last thing
they meant to do, and he had no choice but to surrender at discretion,
almost without firing a shot. Unfortunately, Garibaldi had no power to
keep prisoners of war, even if he wished to do so. Who was to feed and
guard them? Now, as subsequently, he bade the disbanded troops go where
they listed, undertaking to send to Naples by sea as many as desired to go
there. About a thousand accepted; the rest dispersed, forming the first
nucleus of the semi-political and wholly dastardly brigandage which was
later to become the scourge of Southern Italy. Their earliest exploit was
the savage murder of General Briganti, whom they called a traitor, after
the fashion of cowards. This happened at Mileto on the 25th of August,
when Briganti was on his way to join General Ghio, who had concentrated
12,000 men on the town of Monteleone. Garibaldi, whose sound principle it
was to dispose of his enemies one by one as they cropped up, prepared to
attack Ghio with his whole available forces, but he was spared the
trouble. He came, he saw, and he had no need of conquering, for the
soldiers of that bad thing that had been Bourbon despotism in the Italian
south vanished before his path more quickly than the mists of the morning
before the sun. No grounds that will bear scrutiny have ever been adduced
for the reactionary explanation of the marvel: to wit, that the Neapolitan
generals were bribed. By Cavour? The game would have been too risky. By
'English bank-notes,' that useful factor in European politics that has
every pleasing quality except reality? It is not apparent how the
corruptibility of the generals gives a better complexion to the matter,
but the writers on the subject who are favourable to Francis II. seem to
think that it does. Panic-stricken these helpless Neapolitan officers may
deserve to be called, but they <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_303"
id="Page_303">[Pg.303]</a></span> were not bought. And they had cause for
panic with troops of whose untrustworthiness they held the clearest
proofs, and with the country up in arms against them; for a few days after
the taking of Reggio this was the case, and this was by far the greatest
miracle operated by Garibaldi. The populations shook off their apathy, and
not in Calabria only but in the Puglie, the Basilicata, the Abruzzi, there
was a sudden awakening as from a too long sleep. When Garibaldi got to
Monteleone he found that Ghio had evacuated the town. He pursued him to
Soveria, where, on the 30th of August, the 12,000 men laid down their
arms. A few days later, another officer, General Caldarelli, capitulated
with 4000 men. Garibaldi's onward march was a perpetual <i>f&ecirc;te</i>;
everywhere he was received with frantic demonstrations of delight. Still
there was one point between himself and the capital which might reasonably
cause him some anxiety. There were 30,000 men massed near Salerno, in
positions of immense natural strength, where they ought to have been able
to stop the advance of an army twice the size of Garibaldi's. How this
obstacle was removed is far more suggestive of a scene in a comic opera
than of a page in history. Colonel Peard, 'Garibaldi's Englishman,' went
in advance of the army to Eboli, where he was mistaken, as commonly
happened, for his chief. He was past middle age; very tall, with a
magnificent beard and a stern, dictatorial air, which answered admirably
to the popular idea of what the conqueror of Sicily ought to be like,
although there was no resemblance to the real person. It happened that
Eboli was a royalist town and beyond the pale of declared
revolution&mdash;a placid and antiquated little city with a forgotten air,
where life had been probably too easy for its inhabitants to wish for a
change. But the <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">
[Pg.304]</a></span> supposed arrival of the Terrible Man turned everything
upside-down. Peard, with Commander Forbes, who was following the campaign
as a non-combatant, rode up to the house of the old Syndic, who instantly
became their devoted servant. Like wildfire spread the news&mdash;the
whole population besieged the house, brass bands resounded, chinese
lanterns were hung out; the Church, led by the bishop, hurried to the
spot, the Law, headed by a judge, closely following, while the wives of
the local officials appeared in perfectly new bonnets. They all craved an
audience, and the same answer was given to all: that General Garibaldi was
much fatigued and was asleep&mdash;so he was, but ninety miles away. He
would be pleased to receive the deputations if they would return
punctually at half-past three a.m. In the meantime, Peard was in an inner
room, engaged in cannonading Naples with telegrams. He had sent for the
telegraph master, who came trembling like an aspen, and from whom it was
elicited that he had already telegraphed to the Home Office at Naples, and
to the general commanding at Salerno, that Garibaldi was in the town.
Peard remarked casually that he supposed he knew his life was in jeopardy,
and then handed him the following message: 'Eboli, 11.30
p.m.&mdash;Garibaldi has arrived with 5000 of his own men, and 5000
Calabrese are momentarily expected. Disembarkations are expected in the
bay of Naples and the gulf of Salerno to-night. I strongly advise your
withdrawing the garrison from the latter place without delay, or they will
be cut off.' This was despatched to General Ulloa, whom rumour reported to
have been just made minister of war, and was signed in the name of one of
his personal friends. The rumour was false; but the telegram, of course,
reached the desired <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_305" id=
"Page_305">[Pg.305]</a></span> quarter, and the name attached removed all
doubt of its genuineness. It was hardly sent off when a despatch came from
the real war minister, asking the telegraph clerk if news had been
received of the division Caldarelli? To this Peard answered that General
Caldarelli and his division had gone over to Garibaldi yesterday, and now
formed part of the national army. Similar information was sent to General
Scotti at Salerno. Finally, the Syndic of Salerno was asked if he had seen
anything of the Garibaldian expeditions by sea?</p>

<p>Satisfied with his work, Colonel Peard, who knew that there were
Neapolitan troops within four miles of Eboli, and who did not think that
things looked entirely reassuring, decided to beat a somewhat precipitous
retreat. He told the Syndic that he was going to reconnoitre in the
direction of Salerno, and that his departure must be kept a dead secret,
but as soon as he was out of the town he turned the horses' heads
backwards towards the Garibaldian lines. He was still accompanied by
Commander Forbes, to whom, during their midnight drive, he related his
performance on the telegraph wires. 'What on earth is the good of all
this?' said Forbes; 'you don't imagine they will be fools enough to
believe it?' 'You will see,' answered the colonel, 'it will frighten them
to death, and to-morrow they will evacuate Salerno.' And, in fact, at four
o'clock in the morning the evacuation was begun in obedience to
telegraphic orders from Naples.</p>

<p>The 30,000 men recalled from Salerno and the adjacent districts marched
towards Capua. The river Volturno, which runs by that fortified town, was
now chosen as the line of defence of the Bourbon monarchy.</p>

<p>On the 5th of September the King and Queen with the Austrian, Prussian,
Bavarian and Spanish ministers, left Naples for Gaeta on <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg.306]</a></span> board a
Spanish man-of-war. The King issued a proclamation of which the language
was dignified and even pathetic: it is believed to have been written by
Liborio Romano, the Prime Minister, who was at the same moment betraying
his master. Be that as it may, the King's farewell to his subjects and
fellow-citizens might have touched hearts of stone could they but have
forgotten the record of the hundred and twenty-six years of rule to which
he fondly alluded. As it was, in the vast crowds that watched him go,
there was not found a man who said, 'God bless him;' not a woman who shed
a tear. Had any one of the bullets aimed at Ferdinand II. taken fatal
effect, it would have been a less striking punishment for his political
sins than this leaden weight of indifference which descended on his
son.</p>

<p>In the Royal Proclamation Francis II. stated that he had adhered to the
great principles of Italian nationality, and had irrevocably surrounded
his throne with free institutions; nevertheless it is alleged on what
seems good authority that in those last days he veered round to the party
of the Queen Dowager, who was doing all she could to provoke the lazzaroni
to reaction. It was also believed at Naples that he left orders for Castel
Sant' Elmo to bombard the town if Garibaldi entered.</p>

<p>The Dictator was so much pleased with Colonel Peard's telegraphic feats
at Eboli, that he sent him on to Salerno to repeat the farce. Peard's
despatches determined the departure of the Court, and it was to him (in
the belief that he was Garibaldi) that Liborio Romano, three hours before
the King embarked, addressed the celebrated telegram invoking the 'most
desired presence' of the Dictator in Naples. With this document in his
hand, Peard went out with the National Guard to meet the real Garibaldi
who was on his way from Auletta. The Dictator hailed his double with the
cry of 'Viva <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">
[Pg.307]</a></span> Garibaldi,' in which Cosenz and the other officers
cordially joined. The entry of the Liberator into Salerno was greeted with
the wildest enthusiasm, the wonderful beauty of the surroundings seeming a
fitting setting for a scene like the vision of some freedom-loving
poet.</p>

<p>Next morning at half-past nine, Garibaldi, with thirteen of his staff,
started by special train for the capital.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that though the army of Salerno was recalled to
the Volturno, no troops had been withdrawn from Naples. The sentries still
paced before the palaces and public offices, the barracks held their full
complement, Castel Sant' Elmo had all its guns in position. These troops
quartered in the capital, where everything contributed to stimulate their
fidelity, were of different stuff from Ghio's or Caldarelli's frightened
sheep; a White Terror, a repetition of the 15th of May 1848, would have
been much to their mind. There had been no actual revolution; nothing
officially proved that Naples had thrown off the royal allegiance. Such
were the strange circumstances under which Garibaldi, without a single
battalion, came to take possession of a city of 300,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>Courage of this sort either does not exist, or it is supremely
unconscious. It is likely, therefore, that the Dictator gave no thought to
the enormous risk he ran, but his passage from the station to the palace
of the Foresteria, where he descended, was a bad quarter-of-an-hour to the
friends who followed him, and to whom his life seemed the point on which
Italian regeneration yet hung. A chance shot fired by some Royalist
fanatic, and who could measure the result? As he passed under the muzzle
of the guns at the opening of the Toledo, he gave the order: 'Drive
slower, slower&mdash;more slowly still.' <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg.308]</a></span> And he rose and stood up for
a moment in the carriage with his arms crossed. The artillerymen, who had
begun to make a kind of hostile demonstration, changed their minds and
saluted. The sullen looks of the royal soldiers was the only jarring note
in the display of intoxicating joy with which the Neapolitans welcomed the
bringer of their freedom; freedom all too easily had, for if anything
could have purified the Neapolitans from the evil influences of servitude,
it would have been the necessity of paying dearly for their liberties. The
delirium in the streets lasted for several days and nights; what the
consequences would have been of such a state of madness under a paler sky,
it is not pleasant to reflect; here, at least, there were no robberies, no
drunken person was seen; if there were some murders, a careful inquiry
made by an Englishman showed that the number was the same as the average
number of street-murders through the year. At night, when the word passed
'Il Dittatore dorme,' it was enough to clear the streets as if by magic
near the palace (a private one) where in a sixth floor room the idol of
the hour slept. The National Guard, who were the sole guardians of order,
behaved admirably.</p>

<p>For a few days such of the townsfolk as had not completely lost their
heads, underwent acute anxiety as they gazed at the frowning pile of Sant'
Elmo; but finally the officers in command of the garrison decided to
capitulate, contrary, in this instance, to the wishes of the soldiery. The
royal troops marched out of the city towards Capua on the 11th of
September.</p>

<p>Garibaldi's first act had been to hand over the Neapolitan fleet in the
bay to Admiral Persano, a solemn reassertion of his loyalty to Victor
Emmanuel, whom, in his every utterance, he held up to the people as the
best of kings and the father of his country. He instructed his Neapolitan
officer, Cosenz, to form a ministry, and <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg.309]</a></span> wrote to the Marquis
Pallavicini, the prisoner of Spielberg, inviting him to become
Pro-Dictator. Had a man of authority like Pallavicini, who also entirely
possessed the Dictator's confidence, at once assumed that office, much of
the friction which followed might have been spared. But he did not enter
into his functions till October, and in the meanwhile the 'dualism' of
Sicily broke out in an exaggerated form, each side sincerely believing the
other to be on the verge of ruining the country to which they were both
sincerely attached. The appointment of Dr Bertani as Secretary of the
Dictatorship gave rise to controversies which even now, when the grave has
closed over the actors, are hardly at rest. It is time that they should
be. Apart from the war about persons, some of them not very wise persons,
and apart from the fears entertained at Turin, that the freeing of the Two
Sicilies would drift into a republican movement: fears which were
invincible, though, as far as they regarded Garibaldi, they were neither
just nor generous, the question resolved itself, as was the case in
Sicily, into whether the unification of Italy was to go on or whether it
was to halt? Garibaldi refused to give up Sicily to the King's government
because he intended making it the base for the liberation of Naples.
Events had justified him. He now refused to hand over Naples because he
intended making it the base for the liberation of Rome. It has been seen
that he and he alone prevented an attempt at a landing in the Papal states
from being made in the month of August. In deciding, however, that it was
expedient to finish one enterprise before beginning another, he did not
give up Rome: he merely chose what he thought a safer road to go there.
And he now declared without the least concealment that he intended to
proclaim Victor Emmanuel King of Italy from the Quirinal.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">
[Pg.310]</a></span> Would events have justified him again? There was a
French garrison in Rome; this, to Cavour, seemed a conclusive answer.</p>

<p>Cavour was engaged on a series of measures, unscrupulous manoeuvres as
some have called them, masterpieces of statesmanship as they have been
described by others, by which he got back the reins of the Italian team
into his own hands. The plan of an annexionist revolution in Naples before
Garibaldi arrived had failed. So much discontent was felt at the apparent
indifference, or, at least, 'masterly inactivity' of the Sardinian
government in presence of the great struggle in the south that Cavour
began to be afraid of a revolution breaking out in quite a different
quarter, in Victor Emmanuel's own kingdom. It was at this critical
juncture that he resolved to invade the Papal states, and take possession
of the Province of Umbria and the Marches of Ancona.</p>

<p>The decision was one of extreme boldness. For three months Cavour had
been stormed at by all the Foreign Ministers in Turin, excepting Sir James
Hudson, but, as he wrote to the Marquis E. D'Azeglio: 'I shall not draw
back save before fleets and armies.'</p>

<p>Austria, France, Spain, Russia and Prussia now broke off diplomatic
relations with Sardinia. What would be their next act? The danger of
Austria intervening was smaller than it then appeared; Austria was too
much embarrassed in her own house, and especially in Hungary, for her to
covet adventures in Italy. But the French Government did, in the plainest
terms, threaten to intervene, and this notwithstanding that the Emperor
himself appeared to be convinced by Cavour's argument, that the proposed
scheme was the only means of checking the march of revolution, which from
Rome might spread to Paris. By announcing one <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg.311]</a></span> line of policy in public
and another in private, Napoleon left the door open to adopt either one or
the other, according to the development of events. In the sequel, the
Papal party had a right to say that he lured them to their destruction, as
their plan of operations, and in particular the defence of Ancona, was
undertaken in the distinct expectation of being supported by the French
fleet.</p>

<p>As early as April 1860, the Pope invited the Orleanist General
Lamorici&egrave;re to organise and command the forces for the defence of
the Temporal Power, which he had summoned from the four quarters of the
Catholic world. 5000 men, more or less, answered the call; they came
chiefly from France, Belgium and Ireland. Of his own subjects the Pope had
10,000 under arms. In a proclamation, issued on assuming the command,
Lamorici&egrave;re compared the Italian movement with Islamism, a
comparison which aroused intense exasperation in Italy, where the rally of
a foreign crusade against the object which was nearest to Italian hearts,
and for which so many of the best Italians had suffered and died, could
not but call up feelings which in their turn were expressed in no moderate
language. It was a fresh illustration of the old truth&mdash;that the
Papal throne existed only by force of foreign arms, foreign influence.
Lamorici&egrave;re's 'mercenaries' did much harm to the Pope's cause by
bringing home this truth once more to the minds of all. That the corps
contained some of the bluest blood of France, that there were good young
men in it, who thought heaven the sure reward for death in defence of
dominions painfully added in the course of centuries by devices not
heavenly to the original patrimony of Peter, did not and could not
reconcile the Italians to the defiance thrown down to them by a band of
strangers in their own country.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">
[Pg.312]</a></span> Before the opening of hostilities, Victor Emmanuel
offered Pius IX. to assume the administration of the Papal states (barring
Rome) while leaving the nominal sovereignty to the Pope. Nothing came of
the proposal, which was followed by a formal demand for the dissolution of
Lamorici&egrave;re's army, and an intimation that the Sardinian troops
would intervene were force used to put down risings within the Papal
border. On the 11th of September, symptoms of revolution having meanwhile
broken out in the Marches, General Fanti in command of 35,000 men crossed
the frontier. Half these forces under Fanti himself were directed on
Perugia; the other half under Cialdini marched towards Ancona. The
garrisons of Perugia and Spoleto were compelled to surrender, and
Lamorici&egrave;re found his communications cut off, so that he could only
reach the last fortress in the power of the Papal troops, Ancona, by
fighting his way through Cialdini's division, which by rapid marches had
reached the heights of Castelfidardo. His men passed the day of the 17th
in religious exercises, and in going to confession; the vicinity of the
Holy House of Loreto, brought hither by angels from Bethlehem, filled the
young Breton soldiers with transports of religious fervour.
Lamorici&egrave;re had taken from the Santa Casa some of the flags of the
victors of Lepanto to wave over his columns. In the battle of the next day
the French fought with the gallantry of the Vend&eacute;ans whose
descendants they were, and the Irish behaved as Irishmen generally behave
under fire, but the Swiss and Romans mostly fought ill or not at all.
Lamorici&egrave;re excused the conduct of the latter on the ground that
they were young troops; it is likely that they had but little eagerness to
fire on their fellow-countrymen. Being Italians, and above all being
Romans, they <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">
[Pg.313]</a></span> assuredly were not sustained by one scrap of the
mystical enthusiasm of the French: such a state of mind would have been
incomprehensible to them. They knew that so far as dogmas went Victor
Emmanuel was as good a Catholic as the Pope. It is surprising that with
part of his force demoralised Lamorici&egrave;re was still able to hold
his own for three or four hours. General Pimodan and many of the French
officers were killed; Lamorici&egrave;re could say truly: 'All the best
names of France are left on the battlefield.'</p>

<p>After the victory of Castelfidardo, the Sardinian attack was
concentrated on Ancona. Admiral Persano brought the squadron from Naples
to co-operate with Fanti's land forces, and the fortress capitulated on
the 29th of September. The campaign had lasted eighteen days. The
Piedmontese held Umbria and the Marches, and a road was thus opened for
the army of Victor Emmanuel to march to Naples. During the progress of
these events Garibaldi was preparing for the final struggle on the
Volturno. He had not yet given up the hope of carrying his victorious arms
to the Capitol, and from the Capitol to the Square of St Mark. The whole
republican party, and Mazzini himself, who had arrived in Naples, ardently
adhered to this programme. Their argument was not without force, risk or
no risk, when would there be another opportunity as good as the present?
It was very well for Cavour to look forward, as he did to the day of his
death, to a pacific solution of the Roman question; Mazzini saw&mdash;in
which he was far more clear-sighted than Cavour&mdash;that such a solution
would never take place. His arrival at Naples caused alarm at Turin, both
on account of his presumed influence over Garibaldi, the extent of which
was much exaggerated, and from the terror his name spread among European
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg.314]</a></span>
diplomatists. The Dictator was asked to proscribe the man whose latest act
had been to give the last 30,000 francs he possessed in the world to the
expenses of the Calabrian campaign. He refused to do this. 'How could I
have insisted upon sending Mazzini into exile when he has done so much for
Italian unity?' he said afterwards to Victor Emmanuel, who agreed that he
was right. However, he allowed the Pro-Dictator Pallavicini to write a
letter to Mazzini, inviting him to show his generosity by spontaneously
leaving Naples in order to remove the unjust fears occasioned by his
presence. Mazzini replied, as he had a perfect right to do, that every
citizen is entitled to remain in a free country as long as he does not
break the laws. And so the incident closed.</p>

<p>While the Party of Action urged Garibaldi not to give up Rome, other
influences were brought to bear on him in the opposite sense, and
especially that of the English Government, which instructed Admiral Mundy
to arrange a 'chance' meeting between the Dictator and the English
Minister at Naples, Mr. Elliot, on board the flagship <i>Hannibal</i>. Mr.
Elliot pointed out the likelihood of a European war arising from an attack
on Venice, and the certainty of French intervention in case of a
revolutionary dash on Rome. Garibaldi replied that Rome was an Italian
city, and that neither the Emperor nor anyone else had a right to keep him
out of it. 'He was evidently,' writes Admiral Mundy in reporting the
interview, 'not to be swayed by any dictates of prudence.'</p>

<p>In Sicily, the rival factions were bringing about a state approaching
anarchy, but a flying visit from Garibaldi in the middle of September
averted the storm. At this time, Garibaldi's headquarters were at Caserta,
in the vast palace where Ferdinand II. breathed his last. The <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg.315]</a></span> Garibaldian
and the Royal armies lay face to face with one another, and each was
engaged in completing its preparations. It might have been expected, and
for a moment it seems that Garibaldi did expect, that after the solemn
collapse of the Neapolitan army south of Naples, the comedy was now only
awaiting its final act and the fall of the curtain. But it soon became
apparent that, instead of the last act of a comedy, the next might be the
first of a tragedy. The troops concentrated on the right bank of the
Volturno amounted to 35,000, with 6000 garrisoning Capua. About 15,000
more formed the reserves and the garrison of Gaeta. The position on the
Volturno was favourable to the Royalists; the fortress of Capua on the
left bank gave them a free passage to and fro, while the Volturno, which
is rather wide and very deep, formed a grave impediment to the advance of
their opponents. But the chief reason why there was a serious possibility
of the fortunes of war being reversed, lay in the fact that the <i>
moral</i> of these troops was good. All the picked regiments of the army
were here, including 2500 cavalry. The men were ashamed of the stampede
from the south, and were sincerely anxious to take their revenge. Thus the
Neapolitan plan of a pitched battle and a victorious march on Naples was
by no means foredoomed, on the face of things, to failure.</p>

<p>In Garibaldi's short absence at Palermo, the Southern Army (as he now
called his forces) was left under the command of the Hungarian General
T&uuml;rr, as brave an officer as ever lived, and a fast friend to Italy,
but his merits do not undo the fact that as soon as the Dictator's back
was turned, everything got into a muddle. Pontoon bridges had been thrown
across the river at four points; availing himself of one of these,
T&uuml;rr crossed the Volturno with a view to taking up a <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg.316]</a></span> position on
the right bank at a place called Caiazzo, a step which, if attempted at
all, ought to have been supported by a very strong force. On the 19th of
September, Caiazzo was actually taken, but on the 21st the Royalists came
out of Capua with 3000 men and defeated with great loss the thousand or
fewer Garibaldians charged with its defence, only a small number of whom
were able to recross the bridges and join their companions. The saddest
part of this adventure was the slaughter of nearly the whole of the boys'
company&mdash;lads under fifteen, who had run away from home or school to
fight with Garibaldi. Fight they did for five mortal hours, with the
heroism of veterans or of children. Only about twenty were left.</p>

<p>When Garibaldi returned from Sicily, this was the first news he heard,
and it was not cheering. The Royalists, who thought they had won another
Waterloo, were in the wildest spirits, and the march on Naples was talked
of in their camp as being as good as accomplished.</p>

<p>Garibaldi's lines were spread in the shape of a semi-circle, of which
the two ends started from Santa Maria on the left, and Maddaloni on the
right, with Castel Morone at the apex. The country is hilly, and this
fact, together with the great distance covered, divided the 20,000 men
into a number of practically distinct bodies, each of which, in the
decisive battle, had to fight its own fight. Here and there improvised
fortifications were thrown up. Garibaldi was aware that his line of battle
was perilously extended, but the necessity of blocking all the roads and
by-ways which led to Naples, dictated tactics which he was the last to
defend.</p>

<p>The best policy for the Royalists would have been to bring <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg.317]</a></span>
overwhelming numbers to bear on a single point, and, breaking the line, to
march straight on the capital. They were doubtless afraid of an advance
which would have left a portion of the Garibaldian army unbeaten in their
rear. Nevertheless, of the chances that remained to them, this was the
best. At Naples there were no Garibaldian troops to speak of, and the
powers of reaction had been working night and day to procure for the
rightful King the reception due to a saviour of society. Perhaps they
would not have completely failed. There were nobles who were sulking,
shopkeepers who were frightened, professional beggars with whom the
Dictator had opened a fierce but unequal contest, for no blue-bottle fly
is more difficult to tackle than a genuine Neapolitan mendicant; there
were priests who, though not by any means all unpatriotic, were beginning
to be scared by Garibaldi's gift of a piece of land for the erection of an
English church, and by the sale of Diodati's Bible in the streets. And
finally, there was the Carrozzella driver whom a Garibaldian officer had
struck because he beat his horse. These individuals formed a nucleus
respectably numerous, if not otherwise respectable, of anxious watchers
for the Happy Return.</p>

<p>If anyone question the fairness of this catalogue of the partisans of
the fallen dynasty, the answer is, that had their ranks contained worthier
elements, they would not have carefully reserved the demonstration of
their allegiance till the King should prove that he had the right of the
strongest.</p>

<p>Towards five o'clock in the morning of the 1st of October, the
royalists, who crossed the river in three columns, fired the first shots,
and the fight soon became general. King Francis had come from <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg.318]</a></span> Gaeta to
Capua to witness what was meant to be an auspicious celebration of his
birthday. General Ritucci held the chief command. Of the Garibaldians,
Milbitz and Medici commanded the left wing (Santa Maria and Sant' Angelo),
and Bixio the right (Maddaloni), while Castel Morone, through which a road
led to Caserta, was entrusted to Colonel Pilade Bronzetti and three
hundred picked volunteers. Garibaldi's own headquarters was with the
reserves at Caserta, but he appeared, as if by magic, at all parts of the
line during the day, sometimes bringing up reinforcements, sometimes
almost alone, always arriving at the nick of time whenever things looked
serious, to help, direct and reanimate the men. A dozen times in these
journeys by the rugged mountain paths he narrowly escaped falling into the
enemy's hands. No trace of uneasiness was visible on his placid face;
there was, however, more than enough to make a man uneasy. In the early
part of the battle, both Medici and Bixio were pushed back from their
positions. Only Pilade Bronzetti with his handful of Lombard Bersaglieri
never swerved, and held in check an entire Neapolitan column, whose
commander (Perrone) has been blamed for wasting so much time in trying to
take that position instead of joining his 2000 men to the troops attacking
Bixio, but his object was to march on Caserta, where his appearance might
have caused very serious embarrassment.</p>

<p>Up to midday the Royalists advanced, not fast, indeed, but surely. They
fired all the buildings on their path, and amongst others one in which
there were thirty wounded Garibaldians who were burned to death. It was
said to be an accident, but such accidents had better not happen. Victory
seemed assured to them. It is not disputed that on this occasion they
fought well, and they had all the advantages of <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg.319]</a></span> ground, numbers and
artillery. But the volunteers, also, were at their best; they surpassed
themselves. If every man of them had not shown the best military
qualities, skill, resource, the power of recovery, Francis II. would have
slept that night at Naples.</p>

<p>Medici acted with splendid firmness, but at the most critical moment he
had Garibaldi by his side. Bixio was left to fight his separate battle
unaided (so great was the chief's confidence in him), and consummately
well he fought it. After the middle of the day, the Garibaldians began to
retake their positions, and at some points to assume the offensive; still
it was five o'clock before Garibaldi could send his famous despatch to
Naples: 'Victory along all the line.' The battle had lasted ten hours.</p>

<p>The Sicilians and Calabrese under Dunne, who stemmed the first onset at
Casa Brucciata, and under Eber, whose desperate charge at Porta Capua
ushered in the changing fortunes of the day, rivalled the North Italians
in steadiness and in dash. The French company and the Hungarian Legion
covered themselves with glory; it was a pity there was not the English
brigade, 600 strong, which mismanaged to arrive at Naples the day after
the fair. Had they been in time for the fight, they would doubtless have
left a brighter record than the only one which they did leave: that of
being out of place in a country where wine was cheap.</p>

<p>Putting aside Dunne and a few other English officers, England was
represented on the Volturno by three or four Royal Marines who had slipped
away from their ship, the <i>Renown</i>, and were come over to see the
'fun.' It seems that they did ask for rifles, but they did not get them,
their martial deeds consisting in the help they gave in dragging <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg.320]</a></span> off
two captured field-pieces. Never did an exploit cause so much discussion
in proportion with its importance; the Neapolitan Minister in London
informed Lord John Russell that a body of armed men from the British fleet
had been sent by Admiral Mundy to serve pieces of Garibaldian
artillery.</p>

<p>Of all the striking incidents of the day, that which should be
remembered while Italy endures, was the defence of the hillock of Castel
Morone by Bronzetti and his Lombards. Their invincible courage contributed
in no small degree to the final result. One man to eight, they held their
own for ten hours; when summoned to yield by the Neapolitan officer, who
could not help admiring his courage, Pilade Bronzetti replied: 'Soldiers
of liberty never surrender!' It was only in the moment of victory that
Perrone passed over their dead bodies and uselessly advanced&mdash;which
cost him dear on the morrow.</p>

<p>The Garibaldian losses were 2000 killed and wounded and 150 prisoners;
the Neapolitans had the same number placed <i>hors de combat</i>, and lost
3000 prisoners.</p>

<p>Garibaldi had none but his own men; the report that the battle had been
won by soldiers of the Sardinian army who arrived in the afternoon was
false, because they did not arrive till next day, when a battalion of
Piedmontese Bersaglieri took part in defeating Perrone's column, which (it
is hard to say with what idea) descended nearly to Caserta, as its
commander wished to do on the first. Did Perrone not know of the defeat of
yesterday? His column was surrounded and all the men were taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>After the battle of the Volturno the belligerents re-occupied the
positions on the right and left banks of that river which they held <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg.321]</a></span>
before. Military critics speculate as to why Garibaldi did not follow up
his advantage, and the opinion seems general that he did not feel himself
strong enough to do so. The fortress of Capua was a serious obstacle, but
Garibaldi was not accustomed to attach much weight to obstacles whatever
they were, and it is pretty certain that he would have gone in pursuit had
he not received a letter from Victor Emmanuel, who bade him wait till he
came.</p>

<p>By this time he had abandoned all thoughts of marching on Rome. From
the moment that the King's army started for Naples he understood that
persistence in the Roman programme would lead to something graver than a
war of words with the authorities at Turin. Always positive, he gathered
some consolation from the gain to Italy of two Roman provinces, Umbria and
the Marches, and trusted the future with the larger hope.</p>

<p>Constitutional government triumphed over the old absolutism and over
the new dictatorship. And here it may be noted which Constitutional
government, which never had a more sincere and faithful votary than
Cavour, found no favour with Garibaldi at any period of his life. Its
hampering restrictions, its slow processes, irritated his mind, intolerant
of constraint, and he failed to see that this cumbersome mechanism still
gives the best, if not the only, guarantee for the maintenance of freedom.
The sudden transition of Southern Italy from a corrupt despotism to free
institutions brought with it a train of evils, but there was no
alternative. If Italy was to be one, all parts of it must be placed under
the same laws, and that at once.</p>

<p>On the 11th of October the Sardinian parliament sitting at Turin passed
all but unanimously the motion authorising the King's Government to accept
the annexation of those Italian provinces which <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg.322]</a></span> manifested, by universal
suffrage, their desire to form part of the Constitutional Monarchy.
Cavour's speech on this occasion was memorable: 'Rome,' he said, 'would
inevitably become the splendid capital of the Italian kingdom, but that
great result would be reached by means of moral force; it was impossible
that enlightened Catholics should not end by recognising that the Head of
Catholicism would exercise his high office with truer freedom and
independence guarded by the love and respect of 22,000,000 Italians than
entrenched behind 25,000 bayonets.' Of Venice, the martyr-city, he said
'that public opinion was rapidly turning against its retention by Austria,
and that when the great majority of Germans refused to be any longer
accomplices in its subjection, that subjection would be brought to a close
either by force of arms or by pacific negotiations.'</p>

<p>The words were strangely prescient at a time when the Prince Regent of
Prussia was making most melancholy wails over the fall of the Neapolitan
King. The Prussian Government issued a formal protest, which Cavour met by
observing that Prussia, of all Powers, had the least reason to object, as
Piedmont was simply setting her an example which she ought to follow and
would follow, the mission of the two nations being identical. He already
thought of Prussia as an ally: 'Never more French alliances,' he was once
heard to say.</p>

<p>On the same day, the 11th of October, Victor Emmanuel crossed the
Neapolitan frontier at the head of the army which Cialdini led to victory
at Castelfidardo. The King published a proclamation, in which he said that
he closed the era of revolution in Italy. Other bodies of <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg.323]</a></span> Piedmontese
troops had been despatched by sea to Naples and Manfredonia. The passage
of the Piedmontese troops over the Abruzzi mountains was opposed both by a
division of the Bourbon army and by armed peasants, who burnt a man alive
at a place called Isernia; but their advance was not long delayed.</p>

<p>The Neapolitans now began to retire from the right bank of the
Volturno, and retreat towards the Garigliano, their last line of defence.
Garibaldi crossed the river with 5000 men, and moved in the direction by
which the vanguard of the Piedmontese was expected to arrive. At daybreak
on the 26th of October, near Teano, the Piedmontese came in sight.
Garibaldi, who had dismounted, walked up to Victor Emmanuel and said:
'Hail, King of Italy!'</p>

<p>Once before the title was given to a prince of the House of
Savoy&mdash;to Charles Albert, in the bitterest irony by the Austrian
officers who saw him flying from his friends and country by order of his
implacable uncle. A change had come since then.</p>

<p>Victor Emmanuel answered simply: 'Thanks,' and remained talking for a
quarter of an hour in the particularly kind and affectionate manner he
used with Garibaldi, but at the end of the interview, when the leader of
the volunteers asked that in the imminent battle on the Garigliano they
might have the honour of occupying the front line, he received the reply:
'Your troops are tired, mine are fresh, it is my turn now.'</p>

<p>Garibaldi said sadly that evening to an English friend: 'They have sent
us to the rear.' It was the first sign of the ungenerous treatment meted
out to the Garibaldian array to which the King lent himself more than he
ought to have done. He promised to be present on the 6th of November, when
Garibaldi reviewed his volunteers, but after keeping them waiting, sent a
message to say that he could not come. <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg.324]</a></span> The last meeting of all
between the chief and his faithful followers was at Naples, on the
occasion of the distribution of medals to as many as were left of the
Thousand&mdash;less than half. In all his farewell addresses the same note
sounded: 'We have done much in a short time.... I thank you in the name of
our country.... We shall meet again.'</p>

<p>The plebiscites in Umbria and the Marches and in the kingdoms of Naples
and Sicily took place in October. The formula adopted at Naples was more
broadly framed than in the previous plebiscites; it ran: 'The people
desire an united Italy under the sceptre of the House of Savoy.' The vote
was almost unanimous.</p>

<p>On the 7th of November, Victor Emmanuel made his entry into Naples,
with Garibaldi at his side. Next day, in the great throne-room of the
palace, the king-maker delivered to the King the plebiscites of the Two
Sicilies.</p>

<p>Garibaldi had nothing more to do except to pay a last visit to Admiral
Mundy, whose flagship still lay at anchor in the bay. This duty was
performed in the grey dawn of the 9th of November. 'There is the ship
which is to carry me away to my island home,' he said, pointing to an
American merchant vessel, 'but, Admiral, I could not depart without paying
you a farewell visit. Your conduct to me since our first meeting at
Palermo has been so kind, so generous, that it can never be erased from my
memory; it is engraven there indelibly&mdash;it will last my life.'</p>

<p>On leaving the flagship he rowed straight to the American vessel, which
soon afterwards steamed out of the bay. The parting salute fired by the
guns of the <i>Hannibal</i> was all the pomp that attended his departure.
Several hours later the people of Naples knew that their <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg.325]</a></span> liberator
had gone to dig up the potatoes which he had planted in the spring.</p>

<p>By Cavour's advice, Victor Emmanuel offered Garibaldi a dukedom and the
Collar of the Annunziata, which confers the rank of cousin to the King,
besides riches to support these honours. He refused everything, and
returned to Caprera poorer than when he left it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<h4>BEGINNINGS OF THE ITALIAN KINGDOM</h4>

<h5>1860-1861</h5>

<h5>Beginnings of the Italian Kingdom&mdash;The Fall of
Gaeta&mdash;Political Brigandage&mdash;The Proclamation of the Italian
Kingdom&mdash;Cavour's Death.</h5>

<br />
<p>The Neapolitan army retreated, as has been already stated, beyond the
Garigliano. Capua, isolated and surrounded, could render no material
service to the royal cause; it capitulated on the 2nd of November, though
not until the town had been bombarded for forty-eight hours. The siege was
witnessed by Victor Emmanuel, who said to General Delia Rocca: 'It breaks
my heart to think that we are sending death and destruction into an
Italian town.' Two days after the surrender of Capua, Cialdini threw a
bridge over the Garigliano near its mouth, an operation covered by the
guns of Admiral Persano's squadron. His first attempt on the 29th of
October had met with a decided repulse, another proof that this last
remnant of the Neapolitan army was not an enemy to be despised. The second
attempt, however, was successful; part of the Neapolitans fell back upon
Gaeta, and the other part fled over the Papal frontier.</p>

<p>Gaeta, the refuge of the Pope and the fugitive Princes in 1848, now
became the ultimate rock of defence of the Bourbon dynasty. The position
of the fortress is extremely strong and not unlike Gibraltar in its main
features. A headland running out into the sea and rising <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg.327]</a></span> to a height
of three or four hundred feet, it is divided by a strip of sand from the
shore-line. The principal defences were then composed of a triple
semi-circle of ditches and ramparts one higher than the other. Had the
country been flat the difficulties of the siege would have been much
increased; its hilly character allowed Cialdini to fix his batteries on
heights which commanded the top of the Gaeta hill. But to profit by this,
the Piedmontese were obliged to make fourteen miles of roads by which to
bring up their artillery. For a month, 10,000 out of the 20,000 besiegers
were at work with the spade. The defending force amounted to 11,000 men,
and was commanded by General Ritucci. From the first, it was certain that
the obstinate stand made at Gaeta could only result in what Lord John
Russell called a useless effusion of blood; nevertheless it seems to have
been prompted by a real belief that Francis would still recover his
kingdom. The precedent of his father's return from Gaeta may have
strengthened the King's illusion; every day he received highly-coloured
reports of a gathering reaction, and as the French fleet in the bay
prevented Admiral Persano from attacking from the sea, he believed that
the time which he could hold out was indefinite. This policy of the French
Government need not have greatly cheered him, as its motive was less to
help Francis than to prepare the way, by hampering the Piedmontese, for a
little fishing in troubled waters. Prince Murat, descendant of the <i>Beau
Sabreur</i>, was busy writing proclamations to remind the world that if
Francis were impossible and Victor Emmanuel 'wanted finish,' there was an
eligible young man ready to sacrifice the charms of the Boulevards for the
cares of kingship.</p>

<p>On the representations of the British Government the Emperor withdrew
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg.328]</a></span>
his fleet in January, advising Francis II. to renounce a hopeless
resistance. But at this eleventh hour the King had adopted the principle
of 'no surrender,' and he meant to stick to it. It is difficult to blame
him; at anyrate, much more serious is the blame due to the methods of
warfare which he was to adopt or to approve thereafter. His young Queen,
who was frequently seen on the ramparts encouraging the artillerymen at
their guns, had probably much to do with his virile resolution. The
fortress was now attacked by land and by sea, and the bursting of a
powder-magazine inside the walls hastened its doom. On the 15th of January
the Neapolitans laid down their arms, the King having left his dominions
by sea. The first act of the conquerors in the half-ruined town was to
attend a mass for the repose of the souls of the brave men, friends and
foes, who had fallen during the siege. Noisy rejoicings would have been
unseemly, for the vanquished were fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>The telegram announcing the fall of Gaeta went to Caprera; Garibaldi
read it, and a weight was taken off his mind. 'Civil war is at an end,' he
announced to the little party round the supper-table; 'Cialdini with our
army is in Gaeta; now the Italians will not cut one another's throats any
more.' Later in the evening he seemed so depressed that they thought him
ill; Colonel Vecchj went to his bedside to discover what was the matter.
He found him reading the <i>Times</i>, and inquired why he had become so
suddenly sad. After a pause, Garibaldi said: 'Poor boy! Born at the foot
of a throne and perhaps not by his own fault, hurled from it. He too will
have to feel the bitterness of exile without preparation.' 'Is that all?'
asked Vecchj. 'Do you think it nothing?' was the answer. 'Why then,'
persisted Vecchj, half in jest, 'did you go to Marsala?' 'It was the <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg.329]</a></span> duty
of us all to go,' Garibaldi said quickly, 'else how could there have been
one Italy?'</p>

<p>Francis II. would have been happy had he found counsellors to persuade
him to keep pure such titles to sympathy as he then possessed. Decorum, if
not humanity, should have urged him to retire, surrounded by the solitary
flash of glory cast on his fallen cause by the brave defence of Gaeta. But
the revolution, the new Islam, if it could not be conquered must be made
to suffer for its triumph. Hence the exiled King was advised to call in
murder, pillage and rapine as accomplices. The political brigandage which
followed the downfall of the King of the Two Sicilies began after the
battle of the Volturno and extended over five years. Its effect on the
general situation was nil; it harassed and distracted the Italian
Government and created the odious necessity of using severe repressive
measures, but it never placed the crown in danger. One effect it did have,
and that was to raise all over Italy a feeling of reprobation for the late
dynasty, which not all the crimes and follies of the two Ferdinands and
the first Francis had succeeded in evoking. How many bright lives, full of
promise, were lost in that warfare which even the sacred name of duty
could not save from being ungrateful and inglorious! Italians who have
lost their children in their country's battles have never been heard to
complain; nowhere was the seemliness of death for native land better
understood than it has been in the Italy of this century, but to lose son
or brother in a brigand ambush by the hand of an escaped
galley-slave&mdash;this was hard. The thrust was sharpened by the
knowledge that the fomenter of the mischief was dwelling securely in the
heart of Italy, the guest of the Head of the Church. From Rome came money
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg.330]</a></span>
and instructions; from Rome, whether with or without the cognizance of the
authorities, came recruits. The Roman frontier afforded a means of escape
for all who could reach it, however red their hands were with blood. What
further evidence was needed of the impossibility of an indefinite duration
of this state within a state?</p>

<p>King Francis held back at first, but his uncle, the Count of Trapani,
who openly abetted the brigand partisans, drew him more and more into
collusion with them and their works. The Belgian ecclesiastic, Mgr. de
M&eacute;rode, who had then an influence at the Vatican not possessed even
by Antonelli, looked, unless he was much belied, with a very kind eye upon
the new defenders of throne and altar. Efforts have been made to represent
the war as one carried on by loyal peasants. No one denies that every
peasants' war must assume, more or less, an aspect of brigandage;
nevertheless there have been righteous and patriotic peasants' wars, such
as that of the Klephts in Greece. The question is, Whether the political
brigandage in South Italy had any real affinity with the wars of the
Klephts, or even of the Carlists? And the answer must be a negative.</p>

<p>The partisan chiefs in the kingdom of Naples were brigands, pure and
simple, most of whom had either been long wanted by the police, or had
already suffered in prison for their crimes. They organised their troops
on the strict principles of brigand bands, and proposed to them the same
object: pillage. 'Lieut-General' Chiavone who had a mania for imitating
Garibaldi, was the least bad among them; unlike his prototype, he did not
like being under fire, but neither did he care to spill innocent blood.
What, however, can be said for Pilone, 'commander of His Majesty's forces'
on Vesuvius; for Ninco Nanco, <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_331" id=
"Page_331">[Pg.331]</a></span> Bianco dei Bianchi, Tardio, Palma; for
Carusso, who cut the throats of thirteen out of fourteen labourers and
told the one left to go and tell the tale; for the brothers La Gala, who
roasted and ate a priest? It was said that no horror committed during the
Indian Mutiny was here without a parallel.</p>

<p>Of respectable Neapolitans who held responsible posts under the late
<i>r&eacute;gime</i> not one joined the bands, but they contained French,
Austrian and Belgian officers, and one Prussian. A nephew of Mgr. de
M&eacute;rode, the young Marquis de Traz&eacute;gnies, was with Chiavone;
the Carlist, Jos&egrave; Borj&egrave;s, was with a scoundrel named Crocco.
Borj&egrave;s' case is a hard one. He had been made to believe in the
genuine character of the insurrection and thought that he was giving his
sword to an honourable cause. The melancholy disillusion can be traced in
the pages of a note-book which he kept from day to day, and which fell
into the hands of the Italians when he was captured. The brief entries
show a poetic mind; he observes the fertile soil, deploring, only, that it
is not better cultivated; he admires the smiling valleys and the
magnificent woods whose kings of the forest show no mark of the centuries
that passed over their fresh verdure. At first Borj&egrave;s was pleased
with the peasants who came to him, but as they were few, he was obliged to
join Crocco's large band, and he now began to see, with horror, what kind
of associates he had fallen amongst. He had no authority; the brigands
laughed at his rebukes; never in his life, he writes, had he come across
such thieves. Before the enemy they ran away like a flock of sheep, but
when it was safe to do so, they murdered both men and women. In
desperation, Borj&egrave;s resolved to try and get to Rome, that he might
lay the whole truth before the King, but after suffering many hardships,
he was taken with a few others close to the Papal frontier <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg.332]</a></span> and was
immediately shot. He died bravely, chanting a Spanish litany.</p>

<p>Borj&egrave;s' journal notes the opposition of all classes, except the
very poorest and most ignorant. Was it to be believed, therefore, that
this mountain warfare, however long drawn out, could alter one iota the
course of events? If Francis II. supposed the insurrection to be the work
of a virtuous peasantry, why did he allow them to rush to their
destruction?</p>

<p>The task of restoring order was assigned to General Cialdini. He found
the whole country, from the Abruzzi to Calabria, terrorised by the league
of native assassins and foreign noblemen. The Modenese general was a
severe officer who had learnt war in Spain, not a gentle school. If he
exceeded the bounds of dire necessity he merits blame; but no one then
hoped in the efficacy of half measures.</p>

<p>One element in the epidemic of brigandage, and looking forward, the
most serious of all, was an unconscious but profoundly real socialism. If
half-a-dozen socialistic emissaries had assumed the office of guides and
instructors, it is even odds that the red flag of communism would have
displaced the white one of Bourbon. This feature became more accentuated
as the struggle wore on, and after experience had been made of the new
political state. The economic condition of a great part of the southern
population was deplorable, but liberty, so many thought, would exercise an
instantaneous effect, filling the mouths of the hungry, clothing the
naked, providing firing in winter, sending rain or sunshine as it was
wanted. But liberty does none of these things. The disappointment of the
discovery did not count for nothing in the difficulties of that period; it
counts for everything <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_333" id=
"Page_333">[Pg.333]</a></span> in the difficulties of this.</p>

<p>The reorganisation of the southern provinces proceeded very slowly. The
post of Lieutenant-Governor was successively conferred on L.C. Farini,
Prince Eugene of Carignano, and Count Ponza di San Martino; for a short
time Cialdini was invested with the supreme civil as well as military
power. None of these changes met with entire success. The government was
sometimes too weak, sometimes too arbitrary; of the great number of
Piedmontese officials distributed through the south, a few won general
approval, but the majority betrayed want of knowledge and tact, and were
judged accordingly. It was a misfortune for the new administration that it
was not assisted by the steam power of moral enthusiasm which appeared and
disappeared with Garibaldi. There is a great amount of certainty that the
vast bulk of the population desired union with Italy; but it is equally
certain that the new Government, though not without good intentions, began
by failing to please anybody, and the seeds of much future trouble were
planted.</p>

<p>On the 18th of February 1861, the first Italian legislature assembled
at Turin in the old Chamber, where, by long years of patient work and
self-sacrificing fidelity to principle, the possibility of establishing an
Italian constitutional monarchy had been laboriously tested and
established. Only the deputies of Rome and Venice were still missing. The
first act of the new parliament was to pass an unanimous vote to the
effect that Victor Emmanuel and his heirs should assume the title of King
of Italy. The Italian kingdom thus constituted was recognised by England
in a fortnight, by France in three months, by Prussia in a year, by Spain
in four years, by the Pope never.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">
[Pg.334]</a></span> After the merging of Naples in the Italian
body-politic, one of the thorniest questions that arose was the disposal
of the Garibaldian forces. The chief implored Victor Emmanuel to receive
his comrades into his own army, a prayer which the King had not the power,
even if he had the will, to grant, as in the constitutional course of
things the decision was referred to the ministers, who, again, were
crippled in their action by the military authorities at Turin. Though it
is natural to sympathise with Garibaldi in his eagerness to obtain
generous terms for his old companions-in-arms, it may be true that his
demand was not one that could be satisfied in its full extent. The
volunteers were not inferior to the ordinary soldier; about half of them
were decidedly his superior, but they were a political body improvised for
a special purpose, and it is easy to see how many were the reasons against
their forming a division of a conventional army like that of Piedmont.
Nevertheless, the means ought to have been found of convincing them that
their King and country were proud of them, that their great, their
incalculable services were appreciated. That such means were not found was
supposed to be the fault of Cavour. It was only in 1885, on the
publication of the fourth volume of the Count's letters, that it became
known how strenuously he had fought for justice. Military prejudice was
what was really to blame; General Fanti, the Minister of War, even
provoked Cavour into telling him 'that they were not in Spain, and that in
Italy the army obeyed.' 'A cry of reprobation would be raised,' he wrote,
'if, while the Bourbon officers who ran away disgracefully were confirmed
in their rank, the Garibaldians who beat them were coolly sent about their
business. Rather than bear the responsibility of such an act of black
ingratitude, I would go and bury myself at Leri. I despise the <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg.335]</a></span>
ungrateful to the point of not feeling angered by them, and I forgive
their abuse. But, by Heaven, I could not bear the merited blot of having
failed to recognise services such as the conquest of a kingdom of
9,000,000 inhabitants.'</p>

<p>Cavour, in fact, did obtain something; much more than the army
authorities wished to give, but much less than Garibaldi asked or than the
Count would doubtless have given had not his hands been tied. And,
doubtless, he would have given it with more grace.</p>

<p>As it was, the volunteers were deeply offended and sent their griefs by
every post to Caprera. Garibaldi, who refused every favour and honour for
himself, was worked up into a state of fury by what he deemed the wrongs
of his faithful followers, and in April he arrived unexpectedly at Turin
to plead their cause before the Chamber of Deputies. Perhaps by a wise
presentiment he had refused to stand for any constituency; but when Naples
elected him her representative, almost without opposition, he submitted to
the popular will. At Turin he fell ill with rheumatic fever, but on the
day of the debate on the Southern Army he rose from his bed to take his
seat in the Chamber. The case for the volunteers was opened, and this is
worthy of note, by Baron Ricasoli, aristocrat and conservative. Afterwards
Garibaldi got up&mdash;at first he tried to make out the statistics and
particulars which he had on paper, but blinded by passion and by fever, he
threw down his notes and launched into a fierce invective against 'the man
who had made him a foreigner in his own birthplace and the government
which was driving the country straight into civil war.' At the words
'civil war' Cavour sprang to his feet, unwontedly moved, and uttered some
expressions of protest, which were lost in the general uproar. When this
was quieted, Garibaldi finished his speech in a moderate <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg.336]</a></span> tone, and
then General Bixio rose to make that noble appeal to concord which, had he
done nothing else for Italy, should be a lasting title to her gratitude.
'I am one of those,' he said, 'who believe in the sacredness of the
thoughts which have guided General Garibaldi, but I am also one of those
who have faith in the patriotism of Count Cavour. In God's holy name let
us make an Italy superior to the strife of parties.' He might not be
making a parliamentary speech, he added, but he would give his children
and his life to see peace established&mdash;words flowing so plainly from
his honest heart that savage indeed would have been the enmity which, for
the time, at least, was not quelled. Cavour grasped the olive branch at
once; all his momentary ire vanished. He made excuses for his adversary;
from the grief which he had felt himself when he advised the King to cede
Savoy and Nice, he could understand the general's resentment. He had
always been, he said in general terms, a friend to the volunteers. What he
did not even remotely suggest was the dissension which existed between
himself and his military colleague on the subject of the Garibaldians. The
least hint would have gained for Cavour any amount of applause and
popularity; but he preferred to bear all the blame rather than bring the
national army into disfavour. Garibaldi replied 'that he had never doubted
the Count's patriotism;' but at the end of the three days' debate he
declared himself dissatisfied with the Ministerial assurances touching the
volunteers in particular and the country's armaments as a whole. As Cavour
left the Chamber after the final night's sitting, he remarked to a
friend&mdash;all his fine equanimity returned: 'And yet, and yet, when the
time comes for war, I shall take General Garibaldi under my arm and say:
"Let's go and see what they are about inside Verona!"'</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">
[Pg.337]</a></span> Cialdini tried to stir up the quarrel anew by a letter
full of foolish personalities; but to this sort of attack Garibaldi was
impervious. It mattered nothing to him that a man should make rude remarks
about his wearing a red shirt. He admired the victor of Castelfidardo as
one of Italy's best soldiers. He was, therefore, perfectly ready to
embrace Cialdini at the King's request before he left Turin for Caprera.
It cost him more to consent to an interview of reconciliation with the
Prime Minister in the royal presence, because his disagreement with Cavour
was purely political and impersonal, and was rooted more deeply in his
heart than any private irritation could be; but he did consent, and the
interview took place on the 23rd of April. Probably Victor Emmanuel in
after days was never gladder of anything he had done than of having caused
his two great subjects&mdash;both his subjects born&mdash;to part for the
last time in this mortal life in peace.</p>

<p>On one other memorable occasion the man who, at twenty-two, said that
he meant to be Prime Minister of Italy, and who now, at fifty-one, was
keeping his word, filled with his presence the Chamber of which he seemed
to incarnate the life and history&mdash;which may be said to have been his
only home, for Cavour hardly had a private life. Very soon the familiar
figure was to vacate the accustomed place for ever.</p>

<p>An obscure deputy put a question on the 25th of May, which gave Cavour
the opportunity of expounding his views about Rome still more explicitly
than in the previous autumn. It was impossible, he said, to conceive
Italian unity without Rome as capital. Were there any other solution to
the problem he would be willing to give it due consideration, but there
was not. The position of a capital was not <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg.338]</a></span> decided by climatic or
topographical reasons: a glance at capitals of Europe was sufficient to
certify the fact; it was decided by moral reasons. Now Rome, alone out of
the Italian cities, had an undisputed moral claim to primacy. 'As far as I
am personally concerned,' he said, 'I shall go to Rome with sorrow; not
caring for art, I am sure that among the most splendid monuments of
ancient and modern Rome I shall regret the sedate and unpoetic streets of
my native town.' It grieved him to think that Turin must resign her most
cherished privilege, but he knew his fellow-citizens, and he knew them to
be ready to make this last sacrifice to their country. Might Italy not
forget the cradle of her liberties when her seat of government was firmly
established in the Eternal City!</p>

<p>He went on to say that he had not lost the hope that France and the
Head of the Church would yield to the inexorable logic of the situation,
and that the same generation which had resuscitated Italy would accomplish
the still grander task of concluding a peace between the State and the
Church, liberty and religion. These were no formal words; Cavour's whole
heart was set on their realisation. He did not doubt that the knot, if not
untied, would be cut by the sword sooner or later. He felt as sure as
Mazzini felt that this would happen; but more than any man of any party he
had reckoned the cost of ranging the Church with its vast potential powers
for good, for order, for public morality, among the implacable enemies of
the nascent kingdom. And, therefore, his last public utterance was a cry
for religious peace.</p>

<p>Always an immense worker, in these latter months Cavour had been
possessed by a feverish activity. 'I must make haste to finish my work,'
he said; 'I feel that this miserable body of mine is giving way <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg.339]</a></span>
beneath the mind and will which still urge it on. Some fine day you will
see me break down upon the road.' On the 6th of June, after two or three
days of so-called sudden illness, he broke down upon the road.</p>

<p>Fra Giacomo, faithful to his old promise, administered the sacraments
to the dying minister, who told Farini 'to tell the good people of Turin
that he died a Christian.' After this his mind rambled, but always upon
the themes that had so completely absorbed it: Rome, Venice,
Naples&mdash;'no state of siege,' was one of his broken sayings that
referred to Naples. It was his farewell protest against brute force in
which he had never believed. 'Cleanse them, cleanse them,' he repeated;
cleanse the people of the South of their moral contagion; that, not force,
was the remedy. He was able to recognise the King, but unable to collect
the ideas which he wished to express to him.</p>

<p>Cavour's death caused a profound sensation in Europe, and in Italy and
in England awakened great sorrow. Hardly any public man has received so
splendid a tribute as that rendered to his memory in the British Houses of
Parliament. The same words were on the lips of all: What would Italy do
without him? Death is commonly the great reminder that no man is
necessary. Nations fulfil their destinies even though their greatest sons
be laid under the turf. And Italy has fulfilled her destinies, but there
are Italians who believe that had Cavour lived to complete his task,
although his dream of an Eirenicon might never have been realised, their
country would not have passed through the <i>selva selvaggia</i> of
mistakes and humiliations into which she now entered.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<h4>ROME OR DEATH</h4>

<h5>1861-1864</h5>

<h5>Cavour's Successors&mdash;Aspromonte&mdash;The September
Convention&mdash;Garibaldi's Visit to England.</h5>

<br />
<p>There were two possible successors to Cavour, the Tuscan, Bettino
Ricasoli, and Urban Rattazzi, a Piedmontese barrister. The first belonged
to the right, the second to the left centre in the Parliamentary
combinations. Cavour had no very close personal relations with either, but
he knew their characters. Rattazzi formerly held ministerial office under
him, and the long Tuscan crisis of 1859, looked at, as he looked at it,
from the inside, gave him opportunities of judging the Iron Baron who
opposed even his own will on more than one occasion in that great
emergency. Ricasoli was rigid, frigid, a frequenter of the straightest
possible roads; Rattazzi, supple, accommodating, with an incorrigible
partiality for umbrageous by-ways. He was already an 'old parliamentary
hand,' and in the future, through a series of ministerial lapses, any one
of which would have condemned most men to seclusion, he preserved his
talent for manufacturing majorities and holding his party together.
Choosing between these two candidates, Cavour before he died gave his
preference to Ricasoli, who was charged by the King with the formation of
a ministry in which he <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_341" id=
"Page_341">[Pg.341]</a></span> took the Treasury and the Foreign
Office.</p>

<p>Ricasoli was without ambition, and he rather under than over-rated his
abilities, but he went to work with considerable confidence in his power
of setting everything right. A perfectly open and honest statesman ought
to be able, he imagined, to solve the most difficult problems. Why not,
except that the world is not what it ought to be? In home politics he
offended the Party of Action by telling them plainly that if they broke
the law they would have to pay the cost, and he offended his own party by
refusing to interfere with the right of meeting or any other
constitutional right of citizens, whether they were followers of Mazzini
or of anybody else, as long as they kept within legal bounds. He wrote an
elaborate letter to Pius IX., in which he sought to persuade the Pontiff
of the sweet reasonableness of renouncing claims which, for a very long
spell, had cast nothing but discredit on religion. Ricasoli's attitude
towards the Temporal Power was unique in this century. Like Dante's, his
hatred of it was religious. He was a Catholic, not because he had never
thought or studied, but because, having thought and studied, he assented,
and from this standpoint he ascribed most of the wounds of the Church to
her subordination of her spiritual mission to material interests. He
encouraged Padre Passaglia to collect the signatures of priests for a
petition praying the Pope to cease opposing the desires of all Italy; 8943
names were affixed in a short time. The only result of these transactions
was that Cardinal Antonelli remarked to the French Government that the
Holy See would never come to terms with robbers, and that, although at war
with the Turin Cabinet, 'the Pope's relations with Italy were excellent.'
More harmful to Ricasoli than the fulminations of the Vatican was the
veiled but determined hostility of Napoleon III. Cavour succeeded in <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg.342]</a></span> more
or less keeping the Emperor in ignorance of the degree to which their long
partnership resembled a duel. He made him think that he was leading while
he was being led. With Ricasoli there could be no such illusions. Napoleon
understood him to be a man whom he might break, not bend. He thought it
desirable to break him, and Imperial desires had many channels, at that
time, towards fulfilment.</p>

<p>The Ricasoli ministry fell in February 1862, and, as a matter of
course, Rattazzi was called to power. The new premier soon ingratiated
himself with the King, who found him easier to get on with than the
Florentine <i>grand seigneur</i>; with Garibaldi, whom he persuaded that
some great step in the national redemption was on the eve of
accomplishment; with Napoleon, who divined in him an instrument.
Meanwhile, in his own mind, he proposed to eclipse Cavour, out-manoeuvre
all parties, and make his name immortal. This remains the most probable,
as it is the most lenient interpretation to which his strange policy is
open.</p>

<p>Garibaldi was encouraged to visit the principal towns of North Italy in
order to institute the <i>Tiro Nazionale</i> or Rifle Association, which
was said to be meant to form the basis of a permanent volunteer force on
the English pattern. For many reasons, such a scheme was not likely to
succeed in Italy, but most people supposed the object to be
different&mdash;namely, the preparation of the youth of the nation for an
immediate war. The idea was strengthened when it was observed that
Trescorre, in the province of Bergamo, where Garibaldi stopped to take a
course of sulphur baths, became the centre of a gathering which included
the greater part of his old Sicilian staff. There was no concealment in
what was done, and the Government manifested no alarm. <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg.343]</a></span> The air was
full of rumours, and in particular much was said about a Garibaldian
expedition to Greece, for which, it was stated and re-stated, Rattazzi had
promised &pound;40,000. That Garibaldi meant to cast his lot in any
struggle not bearing directly on Italian affairs, as long as the questions
of Rome and Venice still hung in the balance, is not to be believed. A
little earlier than this date, President Lincoln invited him to take the
supreme command of the Federal army in the war for the Union, and he
declined the offer, attractive though it must have been to him, both as a
soldier and an abhorrer of slavery, because he did not think that Italy
could spare him. But the 'Greek Expedition,' though a misleading name, was
not altogether a blind. Before Cavour's death, there had been frequent
discussion of a project for revolutionising the east of Europe on a grand
scale; Hungary and the southern provinces of the Austrian Empire were to
co-operate with the Slavs and other populations under Turkey in a movement
which, even if only partially successful, would go far to facilitate the
liberation of Venice. It cannot be doubted that Rattazzi's brain was at
work on something of this sort, but the mobilisation, so to speak, of the
Garibaldians suggested proceedings nearer home. Trescorre was very far
from the sea, very near the Austrian frontier.</p>

<p>In spite of contradictions, a plan for invading the Trentino, or South
Tyrol, almost certainly did exist. Whether Garibaldi was alone answerable
for it cannot be determined. The Government became suddenly alive to the
enormous peril such an attack would involve, and arrested several of the
Garibaldian officers at Sarnico. They were conveyed to Brescia, where a
popular attempt was made to liberate them; the troops <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg.344]</a></span> fired on
the crowd, and some blood was shed. Garibaldi wrote an indignant protest
and retired, first to the villa of Signora Cairoli at Belgirate, and then
to Caprera. He did not, however, remain there long.</p>

<p>After this point, the thread of events becomes tangled beyond the hope
of unravelment. What were the causes which led Garibaldi into the
desperate venture that ended at Aspromonte? Recollecting his hesitation
before assuming the leadership of the Sicilian expedition, it seemed the
more unintelligible that he should now undertake an enterprise which,
unless he could rely on the complicity of Government, had not a single
possibility of success. His own old comrades were opposed to it, and it
was notorious that Mazzini, to whom the counsels of despair were generally
either rightly or wrongly attributed, had nothing to do with inspiring
this attempt. In justice to Rattazzi, it must be allowed that, after the
arrests at Sarnico, Garibaldi went into open opposition to the ministry,
which he denounced as subservient to Napoleon. Nevertheless, with the
remembrance of past circumstances in his mind, he may have felt convinced
that the Prime Minister did not mean or that he would not dare to oppose
him by force. One thing is certain; from beginning to end he never
contemplated civil war. His disobedience to the King of Italy had only one
purpose&mdash;to give him Rome. He was no more a rebel to Victor Emmanuel
than when he marched through Sicily in 1860.</p>

<p>The earlier stages of the affair were not calculated to weaken a belief
in the effective non-intervention of Government. Garibaldi went to
Palermo, where he arrived in the evening of the 28th of June. The young
Princes Umberto and Amedeo were on a visit to the Prefect, the <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg.345]</a></span>
Marquis Pallavicini, and happened to be that night at the opera. All at
once they perceived the spectators leave the house in a body, and they
were left alone; on asking the reason, they heard that Garibaldi had just
landed&mdash;all were gone to greet him! Before the departure of the
Princes next day, the chief and his future King had an affectionate
meeting, while the population renewed the scenes of wild enthusiasm of two
years ago. Some of Garibaldi's intimate friends assert that when he
reached Palermo he had still no intention of taking up arms. He soon
began, however, to speak in a warlike tone, and at a review of the
National Guard in presence of the Prefect, the Syndic, and all the
authorities, he told the 'People of the Vespers' that if another Vespers
were wanted to do it, Napoleon III., head of the brigands, must be ejected
from Rome. The epithet was not bestowed at random; Lord Palmerston
confirmed it when he said from his place in the House of Commons: 'In Rome
there is a French garrison; under its shelter there exists a committee of
200, whose practice is to organise a band of murderers, the scum and dross
of every nation, and send them into the Neapolitan territory to commit
every atrocity!' As a criticism the words are not less strong; but the
public defiance of Napoleon, and the threat with which it was accompanied,
dictated one plain duty to the Italian Government if they meant to keep
the peace&mdash;the arrest of Garibaldi and his embarkation for
Caprera.</p>

<p>This they did not do; confining themselves to the recall of the Marquis
Pallavicini. Garibaldi went over the ground made glorious by his former
exploits&mdash;past Calatafimi to Marsala. It was at Marsala that, while
he harangued his followers in a church, a voice in the crowd raised a cry
of '<i>Rome or death!</i>' 'Yes; Rome or death!' <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg.346]</a></span> repeated Garibaldi; and
thus the watchword originated which will endure written in blood on the
Bitter Mount and on the Plain of Nomentum. Who raised it first? Perhaps
some humble Sicilian fisherman. Its haunting music coming he knew not
whence, sounding in his ear like an omen, was what wedded Garibaldi
irrevocably to the undertaking. It was the casting interposition of
chance, or, shall it be said, of Providence? Like all men of his mould,
Garibaldi was governed by poetry, by romance. Besides the general
patriotic sentiment, he had a peculiar personal feeling about Rome, 'which
for me,' he once wrote, 'is Italy.' In 1849, the Assembly in its last
moments invested him with plenary powers for the defence of the Eternal
City, and this vote, never revoked, imposed on his imagination a permanent
mandate. 'Rome or death' suggested an idea to him which he had never
before entertained, prodigal though he had been of his person in a hundred
fights: What if his own death were the one thing needful to precipitate
the solution of the problem?</p>

<p>From Marsala he returned to Palermo, where, in the broad light of day,
he summoned the Faithful, who came, as usual, at his bidding, without
asking why or where?&mdash;the happy few who followed him in 1859 and
1860; who would follow him in 1867, and even in 1870, when they gave their
lives for a people that did not thank them, because he willed it so. He
sent out also a call to the Sicilian <i>Picciotti</i>, the <i>Squadre</i>
of last year; and it is much to their credit that they too who cared
possibly remarkably little for <i>Roma Capitale</i>, obeyed the man who
had freed them. And Rattazzi knew of all this, and did nothing.</p>

<p>On the 1st of August, Garibaldi took command of 3000 volunteers in the
woods of Ficuzza. Then, indeed, the Government wasted much paper on <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg.347]</a></span>
proclamations, and closed the door of the stable when the horse was gone.
General Cugia was sent to Palermo to repress the movement. Nevertheless
Garibaldi, with his constantly increasing band, made a triumphant progress
across the island, and a more than royal entry into Catania. At Mezzojuso
he was present at a <i>Te Deum</i> chanted in his honour. On the 22nd,
when the royal troops were, it seems, really ordered to march on Catania,
Garibaldi took possession of a couple of merchant vessels that had just
reached the port, and sailed away by night for the Calabrian coast with
about 1000 of his men.</p>

<p>By this time the Italian Government, whether by spontaneous conviction
or by pressure from without, had resolved that the band should never get
as far as the Papal frontier. If Garibaldi knew or realised their
resolution, it is a mystery why he did not attempt to effect a landing
nearer that frontier, if not actually within it. The deserted shore of the
Pontine marshes would, one would think, have offered attractions to men
who were as little afraid of fever as of bullets. A sort of superstition
may have ruled the choice of the path, which was that which led to victory
in 1860. It was not practicable, however, to follow it exactly. The
tactics were different. Then the desire was to meet the enemy anywhere and
everywhere; now the pursuer had to be eluded, because Garibaldi was
determined not to fight him. Thus, instead of marching straight on Reggio,
the volunteers sought concealment in the great mountain mass which forms
the southernmost bulwark of the Apennines. The dense and trackless forests
could have given cover for a long while to a native brigand troop, with
intimate knowledge of the country and ways and means of obtaining
provisions&mdash;not to a band like this of Garibaldi. They wandered about
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg.348]</a></span>
for three days, suffering from almost total want of food, and from the
great fatigue of climbing the dried-up watercourses which serve as paths.
On the 28th of August they reached the heights of Aspromonte&mdash;a
strong position, from which only a large force could have dislodged them
had they defended it.</p>

<p>General La Marmora, then Prefect of Naples, and commander-in-chief of
the army in the south, reinforced the troops in Calabria to prevent
Garibaldi's advance, but the direction of the decisive operation fell by
accident to Cialdini, whom the Government despatched to Sicily when they
tardily made up their minds to take energetic measures. On his voyage to
Messina, Cialdini heard that the volunteers had already crossed the
Straits; he therefore changed his course, and hastening to Reggio,
invested himself with the command on the mainland. At Reggio he met
Colonel Pallavicini, whom he ordered in terms that might have been more
suitable had he been engaged in hunting brigands, 'to crush Garibaldi
completely, and only accept from him unconditional surrender.' Pallavicini
started with six or seven battalions of Bersaglieri. It was the 29th of
August. Garibaldi saw them coming when they were still three miles off. He
could have dispersed his men in the forest and himself escaped, for the
time, and perhaps altogether, for the sea which had so often befriended
him was not far off. But although he did not mean to resist, a dogged
instinct drove away the thought of flight. In the official account it was
stated that an officer was sent in advance of the royal troops to demand
surrender. No such officer was seen in the Garibaldian encampment till
after the attack. The troops rapidly ascended an eminence, facing that on
which the Garibaldians were posted, and opened a violent fusillade, which,
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg.349]</a></span>
to Garibaldi's dismay, was returned for a few minutes by his right,
consisting of young Sicilians who were not sufficiently disciplined to
stand being made targets of without replying. The contention, however,
that they were the first to fire, has the testimony of every eye-witness
on the side of the volunteers against it. All the Garibaldian bugles
sounded 'Cease firing,' and Garibaldi walked down in front of the ranks
conjuring the men to obey. While he was thus employed, a spent ball struck
his thigh, and a bullet entered his right foot. At first he remained
standing, and repeated, 'Do not fire,' but he was obliged to sit down, and
some of his officers carried him under a tree. The whole 'feat of arms,'
as General Cialdini described it, did not last more than a quarter of an
hour.</p>

<p>Pallavicini approached the wounded hero bareheaded, and said that he
made his acquaintance on the most unfortunate day of his own life. He was
received with nothing but kind praise for doing his duty. The first night
was passed by the prisoner in a shepherd's hut. The few devoted followers
who were with him were strangely impressed by that midnight watch; the
moon shining on the forest, the shepherds' dogs howling in the mountain
silence, and their chief lying wounded, it might be to death, in the name
of the King to whom he had given this land.</p>

<p>Next day, in a litter sheltered from the sun with branches of wild
laurel, Garibaldi was carried down the steep rocks to Scilla, whence he
was conveyed by sea to the fort of Varignano. It was not till after months
of acute suffering, borne with a gentleness that made the doctors say:
'This man is not a soldier, but a saint,' that, through the skill of the
French surgeon, N&eacute;laton, the position of the ball was determined,
and its extraction rendered possible.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">
[Pg.350]</a></span> A general amnesty issued on the occasion of the
marriage of the King's second daughter with the King of Portugal relieved
the Government of having to decide whether Garibaldi was to be tried, and
if so, what for; but the unpopularity into which the ministry had fallen
could not be so easily dissipated. The Minister of Foreign Affairs
(Durando) published a note in which it was stated that Garibaldi had only
attempted to realise, in an irregular way, the desire of the whole nation,
and that, although he had been checked, the tension of the situation was
such that it could not be indefinitely prolonged. This was true, but it
hardly improved the case for the Government. In Latin countries, ministers
do not cling to power; as soon as the wind blows against them, they resign
to give the public time to forget their faults, and to become dissatisfied
with their political rivals. Usually a very short time is required.
Therefore, forestalling a vote of censure in the Chambers, where he had
never yet had a real majority, Rattazzi resigned office with a parting
homily in which he claimed to have saved the national institutions.</p>

<p>The administration which followed contained the well-known names of
Farini, Minghetti, Pasolini, Peruzzi, Delia Rovere, Menabrea. When
Farini's fatal illness set in, Minghetti replaced him as Prime Minister,
and Visconti Venosta took the Foreign Office. They found the country in a
lamentable state, embittered by Aspromonte, still infected with
brigandage, and suffering from an increasing deficit, coupled with a
diminishing revenue. The administrative and financial unification of
Italy, still far from complete, presented the gravest difficulties. The
political aspect of affairs, and especially the presence of the French in
Rome, provoked a general sense of instability which was contrary to the
organisation of the new state <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_351" id=
"Page_351">[Pg.351]</a></span> and the development of its resources. The
ministers sought remedies or palliatives for these several evils, and to
meet the last they opened negotiations with France, which resulted in the
compromise known as the September Convention. It was long before the
treaty was concluded, as for more than a year the French Government
refused to remove the garrison on any terms; but in the autumn of 1864 the
following arrangement was signed by both parties: that Italy should
protect the Papal frontier from all attack from the outside; that France
should gradually withdraw her troops, the complete evacuation to take
place within two years; that Italy should waive the right of protest
against the internal organisation of the Papal army unless its proportions
became such as to be a manifest threat to the Italian kingdom; that the
Italian capital should be moved to Florence within six months of the
approval of the Convention by Parliament.</p>

<p>These terms were in part the same as those proposed by Prince Napoleon
to Cavour shortly before the death of that statesman, who had promised to
support them as a temporary makeshift, and in order to get the French out
of Italy. But they were in part different, and they contained two new
provisions which it is morally certain that Cavour would never have agreed
to&mdash;the prolongation of the French occupation for two years (Cavour
had insisted that it should cease in a fortnight), and the transfer of the
capital, which was now made a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> by Napoleon, for
evident reasons. While it was clear that Turin could not be the permanent
capital of a kingdom that stretched to &AElig;tna, if once the seat of
government were removed to Florence a thousand arguments and interests
would spring up in favour of keeping it there. So, at least, it was sure
to seem to a foreigner. As a matter of fact, the solution was no solution;
the Italians could <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">
[Pg.352]</a></span> not be reconciled to the loss of Rome either by the
beauty and historic splendour of the city on the Arno, or by its immunity
from malaria, which was then feared as a serious drawback, though Rome has
become, under its present rulers, the healthiest capital in Europe. But
Napoleon thought that he was playing a trump card when he dictated the
sacrifice of Turin.</p>

<p>The patriotic Turinese were unprepared for the blow. They had been told
again and again that till the seat of government was established on the
Tiber, it should abide under the shadow of the Alps&mdash;white guardian
angels of Italy&mdash;in the custody of the hardy population which had
shown itself so well worthy of the trust. The ministry foresaw the effect
which the convention would have on the minds of the Turinese, and they
resorted to the weak subterfuge of keeping its terms secret as long as
they could. Rumours, however, leaked out, and these, as usual, exaggerated
the evil. It was said that Rome was categorically abandoned. On the 20th
of September crowds began to fill the streets, crying: 'Rome or Turin!'
and on the two following days there were encounters between the populace
and the military, in which the latter resorted to unnecessary and almost
provocative violence. Amidst the chorus of censure aroused by these
events, the Minghetti cabinet resigned, and General La Marmora, who, as a
Piedmontese, was fitted to soothe the excited feelings of his
fellow-citizens, was called upon to form a ministry.</p>

<p>The change of capital received the sanction of Parliament on the 19th
of November. Outside Piedmont it was not unpopular; people felt that,
after all, it rested with themselves to make Florence no final
halting-place, but a step towards Rome. The Papal Government, which had
been a stranger to the late negotiations, expressed a supreme <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg.353]</a></span>
indifference to the whole affair, even to the contemplated departure of
the French troops, 'which concerned the Imperial Government, not the
Pope,' said Cardinal Antonelli, 'since the occupation had been determined
by French interests.' It cannot be asserted that the Pope ever assumed a
gratitude which he did not feel towards the monarch who kept him on his
throne for twenty years.</p>

<p>This year, 1864, was marked by an incident which, though not a
political event, should never be forgotten in the history of Italian
liberation&mdash;Garibaldi's visit to England. He came, the prisoner of
Aspromonte, not the conqueror of Sicily: a distinction that might have
made a difference elsewhere, but the English sometimes worship misfortune
as other peoples worship success. No sovereign from oversea was ever
received by them as they received the Italian hero; a reception showing
the sympathies of a century rather than the caprice or curiosity of an
hour. Half a million throats shouted London's welcome; the soldier of two
worlds knew the roar of battle, and the roar of the sea was familiar to
the Nizzard sailor, but it is said that when Garibaldi heard the
stupendous and almost awful British roar which greeted him as he came out
of the Nine Elms station, and took his seat in the carriage that was to
convey him to Stafford House, he looked completely disconcerted. From the
heir to the throne to the crossing-sweeper, all combined to do him honour;
where Garibaldi was not, through the breadth of the land the very poor
bought his portrait and pasted it on their whitewashed cottage walls.
London made him its citizen. The greatest living English poet invited him
to plant a tree in his garden: a memory he recalled nearly at the close of
his own honoured life:&mdash;</p>

<p>Garibaldi showed himself mindful of old friends; at the opera he
recognised Admiral Mundy in a box, and immediately rose and went to offer
him his respects. At Portsmouth, he not only went to see the mother of
Signora White-Mario (the providence of his wounded in many a campaign),
but also paid an unrecorded visit to two maiden sisters in humble
circumstances, who had shown him kindness when he was an exile in England;
they related ever afterwards the sensation caused by his appearance in
their narrow courtyard, where it was difficult to turn the big carriage
which the authorities had placed at his disposal. He twice met the great
Italian whom he addressed as Master: transferring, as it were, to
Mazzini's brows the crown of glory that surrounded his own. Another exile,
Louis Blanc, used to tell how, when he went to call on Garibaldi, he found
him seated on a sofa, receiving the homage of the fairest and most
illustrious members of the English aristocracy; when the Friend of the
People was announced (a title deserved by Louis Blanc, if not for his
possibly fallacious theories, still for the rare sincerity of his life),
the hero started to his feet and most earnestly begged him to sit beside
him. 'Which I could not do!' the narrator of the scene would add with a
look of comical alarm for his threatened modesty.</p>

<p>These friendly passages with the proscripts in London, as well as the
stirring appeal spoken by Garibaldi on behalf of the Poles, did not please
foreign Powers. The Austrian ambassador shut himself up in his house; it
was remarked that the only members of the diplomatic body <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg.355]</a></span> who were
seen at the Garibaldi <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> were the representatives of the
United States and of the Sublime Porte. The Emperor Napoleon was said to
be angry. Lord Palmerston assured the House of Commons that no
remonstrance had been received from France or from any foreign government,
and that if it had been received, it would not have been heeded. Yet the
English Government took the course of hinting to the guest of England that
his visit had lasted long enough. In some quarters it was reported that
they feared disturbances among the Irish operatives in the manufacturing
towns, had he gone, as he intended, to the north. Whatever were the
motives that inspired it, their action in the matter cannot be remembered
with complacency, but it was powerless to undo the significance of the
great current of enthusiasm which had passed through the English land.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<h4>THE WAR FOR VENICE</h4>

<h5>1864-1866</h5>

<h5>The Prussian Alliance&mdash;Custoza&mdash;Lissa&mdash;The
Volunteers&mdash;Acquisition of Venetia.</h5>

<br />
<p>The change of capital was carried out in 1865, and the lull which
followed gave an appearance of correctness to the surmise that if the
September Convention had not solved the Roman question, it had, anyhow,
reduced it to a state of quiescence. But there were other reasons why Rome
was kept, for the moment, not indeed out of mind, but out of sight. The
opinion grew that the emancipation of Venice, too long delayed, ought to
take precedence of every other political object. On this point there was
no disagreement among the 22,000,000 free Italians, who felt the servitude
of Venice to be an hourly disgrace and reproach; no one even ventured to
preach patience. A curious chapter might be written on the schemes woven
between the Peace of Villafranca and the year 1866, for the realisation of
the unfulfilled promise of freedom from Alps to sea. Foremost among the
schemers was Victor Emmanuel, and if some persons may be shocked by the
idea of a royal conspirator, more will admire the patriotism which made
the King hold out his hand to Mazzini, whose sentiments about monarchy,
and especially about the Savoy dynasty, were a secret to no one, least of
all to him. But as Mazzini placed those sentiments on <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg.357]</a></span> second rank
to the grand end of Italian unity, so the King, to serve the same end,
showed himself superior to prejudices which in most men would have proved
insuperable. The fact that Victor Emmanuel opened negotiations with
Mazzini, and maintained them, off and on, for years, proves amongst other
things, that he knew the exiled patriot better than the world yet knew
him. He may have understood that by turning republican sympathies into the
groove of unity (not their necessary or even their most natural groove),
Mazzini made an Italian kingdom possible. There is reason to think that
the King's ministers were kept entirely ignorant of his correspondence
with the Agitator. The letters were impersonal drafts carried to and fro
by means of trusted emissaries; each party freely expounded his views, and
stated the terms on which his support could be given. Victor Emmanuel's
favourite idea was a revolution in Galicia. When Garibaldi returned from
England he was nearly commissioned to start for Constantinople, whence he
was to lead an expedition through Roumania into Galicia. It seems to have
been due to Garibaldi's own good sense that so extremely unpromising a
project was abandoned. General Klapka was another of Victor Emmanuel's
secret revolutionary correspondents. The very wildness of the plans that
floated in the air betokened the feverish anxiety to do something which
had taken hold of all minds.</p>

<p>In 1865 a scheme of a different sort, and of momentous consequences,
grew into shape. It was a scheme of which Cavour first guessed the
possibility, as well as the far-reaching results. In August 1865 Count
Bismarck asked General La Marmora whether Italy would join Prussia in the
contingency of a war with Austria? Only a year before he was still <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg.358]</a></span>
thinking of carrying out his policy with the aid of Austria, and he had
offered to help her to wrench Lombardy from Italy (and from France if she
intervened), in payment for her consent to his designs. But now, though
the Austrians did not even remotely suspect it, his thoughts were
resolutely turned to the Italian alliance. Without this alliance Italy
might, indeed, have acquired Venice, but would the German Empire have been
founded?</p>

<p>For a time the proposal was suspended, owing to the temporary
understanding concluded between Prussia and Austria at Gastein; and in the
interim, General La Marmora urged the Viennese Government to cede Venetia
in return for a compensation of five hundred million francs. But those
whom the gods would destroy they make mad. Austria preserved her
infatuated sense of security almost till the rude awakening caused by the
rifle-shots that ushered in the campaign of Sadowa.</p>

<p>One thing which contributed to keeping Europe in the dark as to the
impending cataclysm was the character and known tendencies of King William
I. of Prussia, whose conservative, not to say retrograde sentiments made
it difficult to picture him at the head of what was really a great
revolutionary movement, in spite of the militarism that surrounded it.
With consummate art, Count Bismarck little by little concentrated all his
master's ideas about royal divinity in general into one overwhelming
belief in his own divine right to be German Emperor, and so transformed an
obstacle into the corner-stone of the edifice he wished to build. But this
could hardly be foreseen. At the New Year's Day reception of 1866,
Napoleon announced an era of universal peace; henceforth all nations were
to arrange their <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">
[Pg.359]</a></span> differences amicably, as had been done at Gastein If
the illusion was complete, it was destined to be of short duration.</p>

<p>In the spring the Prussian proposal to Italy was formally renewed, and
this time it was accepted. The secret treaty of an offensive and defensive
alliance for three months was signed on the 8th of April. Less than three
weeks later, Austria, which was slowly beginning to feel some uneasiness,
proposed to Napoleon the cession of Venetia, while exacting from Italy
only a simple promise of neutrality in case of war. General La Marmora
held the honour of the country and his own to compel fidelity to the prior
arrangement with Prussia, and he refused the tempting offer. His choice
has been variously characterised as one of common honesty and of uncommon
magnanimity; at all events, it was of incalculable advantage to Prussia,
which already gave signs of not being a particularly delicate-minded ally.
When La Marmora asked Bismarck whether, in case Austria took the
initiative of attacking Italy, Prussia would intervene, the answer was
'No.'</p>

<p>The three countries now pushed on their war preparations: Austria with
less ardour than the others, as she still failed to more than faintly
realise her danger. The Italian army, which the opening of the year found
in a deplorably unserviceable condition, was rapidly placed on a
war-footing, and, considering the shortness of the time allowed for the
work, and the secrecy with which, at the outset, it had to be conducted,
it is generally agreed that La Marmora produced surprising results. As was
natural in an army which, except for the old Piedmontese nucleus, might
almost be called improvised, the weakest points were the cavalry and the
artillery. The infantry was good; not only the picked corps of
Bersaglieri, but also the line regiments were <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg.360]</a></span> equal to any troops
likely to be opposed to them. No one can see the fine appearance of a line
regiment marching down the streets of an Italian town without receiving
the impression that, however much the other branches of the service may
have improved since the Sixties, the fondest hopes of Italy in case of war
still lie in that common soldier who best supported the rigours of the
Russian snows.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the attention paid to the army was not extended to the
fleet, which continued totally unready; nor was the organisation of the
volunteers carried out in an efficient manner. The excuse afterwards
advanced was that not more than 15,000 enrolments were expected, while the
actual figure reached 35,000. Besides being from its very bulk less
manageable than the 'few and good' of 1859, this mass of men was
ill-provided with officers who could inspire and keep discipline.
Garibaldi's own generals, Bixio, Medici, Cosenz and Sirtori, were now all
in the regular army, and therefore not free to join him. He begged for the
loan of a few regular officers, indicating amongst other names that of
Colonel Pallavicini, who commanded against him at Aspromonte: a trait
characteristic of the man. But this assistance, though promised, was not
granted, and the same was the case with the guns which were vainly asked
for. Without charging La Marmora with a deliberate intention of neglecting
the volunteers, it must be owned that under the influence of the prejudice
which holds irregular troops in small esteem, he did not do for them what
ought to have been done if their services were accepted at all.</p>

<p>The Austrian Southern Army, excellent in discipline and equipment
though weak in numbers, was commanded up to the outbreak of the war by
Field-Marshal Benedek, but he was called to Vienna to take command of
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg.361]</a></span>
the unfortunate army of operation against Prussia, and was succeeded in
Italy by the Archduke Albrecht, with General Von John, an officer of the
first capacity, as chief of the staff.</p>

<p>The numerical strength of the forces which could be put in the field
has been stated with startling divergence by different military writers on
the war, but every calculation gives the Italian side (exclusive of the
volunteers) a superiority of not less than two to one. The Austrian
mobilised army has been reckoned at as low a figure as 63,000, certainly
an understatement, as it appears that the Archduke mustered not less than
70,000 at the battle of Custoza. That he mustered on that day every man he
could produce is probably a fact. Had the Italian generals followed the
same rule, however enormous their other errors might have been, they would
have won. Of all conceivable faults in a military commander that which is
the least pardonable is the neglect to crush his antagonist by force of
superior numbers when he has them at his disposal. How many great military
reputations have been built up, and justly built up, on the care never to
meet an enemy without the odds being largely in your favour!</p>

<p>For obvious political reasons the King of Italy assumed the supreme
command of the army, with General La Marmora as chief of the staff.
Cialdini had been offered the latter post, but he declined it, objecting,
it is said, to the arrangement by which the real head of the army has no
guarantee against the possible interference of its nominal head. When La
Marmora went to the front, Baron Ricasoli took his place as Prime
Minister; Visconti-Venosta became Minister of Foreign Affairs; and the
Ministry of the Marine was offered to Quintino Sella, who refused it on
the ground that he knew nothing of naval matters. It was then offered to
and accepted by a man who knew <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_362"
id="Page_362">[Pg.362]</a></span> still less, because he did not even know
his own ignorance, Agostino Depretis, a Piedmontese advocate.</p>

<p>Before the commencement of hostilities a secret treaty was concluded
between Napoleon III. and the Austrian Government, according to which
Venetia was to be ceded to the Emperor for Italy, even if Austrian arms
were victorious both on the Mincio and on the Maine. Napoleon's real
purpose in this singular transaction is not perfectly clear; but he was
probably acting under a semi-romantic desire to have the appearance of
completing his programme of freeing Italy from the Alps to the Adriatic
which had been interrupted at Villafranca. In spite of his enmity towards
Italian unity, there is no reason to doubt that he was in very few things
as sincere as in the wish to see the Austrians out of Italy. His
reckonings at this time were all founded on the assumption that Prussia
would be defeated; he even seems to have had some hopes of getting the
Rhine bank in return for his good offices on behalf of that Power with
triumphant Austria. Be this as it may, he inspired the Italian Government
(or rather La Marmora, for there were then two Italian Governments, and
the real one was on the Mincio) with his own expectation of Prussian
disasters, and it is possible that this expectation had a material and
unfavourable influence on the manner of conducting the war in Italy.</p>

<p>Through the Prussian Minister at Florence, General La Marmora received
the draft of a plan of campaign which is known to have been prepared by
Count Moltke; in it the great feature was a descent on the Dalmatian
coast. From an independent quarter he received another plan in which a
descent on the east coast of the Adriatic was contemplated, the main
difference being that Istria, instead of Dalmatia, was <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg.363]</a></span> proposed
for the landing-point. This second plan was modestly submitted to him by
Garibaldi, who was thus in substantial accord with the Prussian
strategist. The prospect which either of these plans opened was one of
great fascination. What Italian can look across the sea to where the sun
rises and forget that along that horizon lies a land colonised by Rome and
guarded for four hundred years by Venice?</p>

<p>Istria was marked out by Dante as the frontier province of Italy:</p>

<pre>
     Si come a Pola presso del Quarnero
     Che Italia chiude e i suoi termini bagna.
</pre>

<p>It forms, with the Trentino, what is called <i>Italia Irredenta</i>.
Although the feeling of Italians for unredeemed Italy is not what their
feeling was for Lombardy or Venetia, it is a mistake to imagine that they
have renounced all aspirations in that direction. Only fanatics of the
worst kind would be disposed to attempt, in the present situation, to win
those provinces by force, but that has nothing to do with the matter. The
aspiration exists and cannot help existing. It has always been shared by
patriots of all denominations. An English statesman who called on Pius IX.
was somewhat surprised by the Pope saying that Italian unity was very
well, but it was a pity it did not include Trento and Trieste.</p>

<p>The case of Dalmatia is different; there the mass of the population is
unquestionably of a non-Italian race, though that race is one which,
whenever left to itself, seems created to amalgamate with the Italian.
Slav and Teuton are racially antagonistic, but the Slav falls into Italian
ways, speaks the Italian language and mixes his blood with Italian blood:
with what results Venice can tell. For more than two thousand years the
civilisation of Dalmatia has been exclusively Latin; the Roman column
points to the Venetian Campanile; all the <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg.364]</a></span> proudest memories are
gathered round the Lion of St Mark, which in every town, almost in every
village, recalls the splendid though not blameless suzerainty of the
Serene Republic. The sky, the olive-groves, the wild pomegranates make us
think of Salerno; by the spoken tongue we are often reminded of Tuscany,
for few Italian dialects are so pure. The political subjection of the
country to Italy dates from Augustus; its political subjection to Austria
dates from Napoleon. Dalmatia, with the glorious little commonwealth of
Ragusa, and the free city of Cattaro, was bartered away with Venice at
Campo Formio; and as with Venice, so with Dalmatia, the Holy Alliance
violated its own principle of restoring the proe-Napoleonic state of
things and confirmed the sale.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war, Austria did not ignore that her loss of
territory might exceed Venetia. The Archduke Albrecht, in his proclamation
to his soldiers, appealed to them to protect their mothers, wives and
sisters from being ruled by a foreign race.</p>

<p>Even a successful raid upon Dalmatia or Istria need not have given
those districts to Italy, but it would have brought such an event within
the range of a moderately strong political telescope. The Slavs (erected
since into a party hostile to their Italian fellow-citizens by a fostering
of Panslavism which may not, in the long run, prove sound policy for
Austria) were then ready to make friends with anyone opposed to their
actual rulers. They would not have been easy to govern after an Italian
invasion; still less easy to govern would the Latin element have been,
which was and is <i>Italianissimo</i>. Since Prussia became the German
Empire, she has set her face against Italian extension eastward, but in
1866, had her advice been intelligently acted upon, it might have
generated facts the logic of which none <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg.365]</a></span> would have had the power to
stay.</p>

<p>Moltke's plan more than hinted at a march on Vienna by the Semmering,
and this is what is supposed to have induced La Marmora to treat it with
scorn. With the bogey of Prussia vanquished before his eyes, he doubtless
asked what the Italians would do at Vienna if they got there? He put the
plan in his pocket, and showed it neither to his staff nor to the King,
who would certainly have been attracted by it, as he had set his heart on
the volunteers, at least, crossing the Adriatic. With regard to the
campaign at home, both Moltke and Garibaldi counselled turning the
Quadrilateral in preference to a direct attack upon fortresses which had
been proved impregnable except with the assistance of hunger, and at
present they were better provisioned than in 1848. The turning of the
Quadrilateral meant the adoption of a route into Venetia across the Po
below Mantua. An objection not without gravity to that route was the
unfavourable nature of the ground which, being marshy, is liable after
heavy rains to become impassable. But against this disadvantage had to be
weighed the advantage of keeping out of the mouse-trap, the fatality of
which needed no new demonstration.</p>

<p>In Italy it is common to hear it said that it was necessary to station
a large army on the Mincio to bar the Archduke's path to Milan. But apart
from the rumoured existence of a promise to the French Emperor not to
invade Lombardy, it was unlikely that so good a general as the Archduke
would have taken his small army far from the security it enjoyed among the
four fortresses which, if the worst came to the worst, assured him a safe
line of retreat.</p>

<p>The plan adopted by La Marmora is vaguely said to have been that which
was prepared by the French and Sardinian staffs for use in 1859, had <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg.366]</a></span> the
war been continued. But in what it really consisted is not to this day
placed beyond dispute. The army, roughly speaking, was divided into
halves; one (the larger) half under the King and La Marmora was to operate
on the Mincio; the other, under Cialdini, was to operate on the lower Po.
It is supposed that one of these portions was intended to act as a blind
to deceive the enemy as to the movements of the other portion; the
undecided question is, which was meant to be the principal and which the
accessory?</p>

<p>The volunteers were thrown against the precipices of the Tridentine
mountains, where a detachment of the regular army, well-armed and properly
supplied with artillery, would have been better suited for the work. The
Garibaldian headquarters was at Sal&ograve; on the Lake of Garda. Less
than half of the 35,000 volunteers who appear upon paper, were ever ready
to be sent to the front. It was widely said that only patriotism prevented
Garibaldi from throwing up his command, so dissatisfied was he with the
conduct of affairs.</p>

<p>Prussia invaded Hanover and Saxony on the 16th of June, and declared
war with Austria on the 21st, one day after the Italian declaration of war
had been delivered to the Archduke Albrecht. On the 23rd La Marmora's army
began to cross the Mincio. It consisted of three <i>corps
d'arm&eacute;e</i> under the command of Generals Durando, Cucchiari and
Delia Rocca, each corps containing four divisions. The force under
Cialdini was composed of eight divisions forming one <i>corps
d'arm&eacute;e.</i> An Italian military writer rates the numbers at
133,000 and 82,000 respectively. La Marmora acquired the belief that the
Archduke's attention was absorbed by Cialdini's movements on the Po, and
that his <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">
[Pg.367]</a></span> own operations on the Mincio would pass
unobserved.</p>

<p>While the Italian commander had no information of what was going on in
the enemy's camp, the Archduke's intelligence department was so efficient
that he knew quite well the disposition of both Italian armies. Cialdini's
advance, if he meant to advance, was checked by floods. On the night of
the 23rd most of La Marmora's force bivouacked on the left (Venetian) bank
of the Mincio. No reconnaissances were made; everyone supposed that the
Austrians were still beyond the Adige, and that they intended to stay
there. The King slept at Goito.</p>

<p>Before the early dawn next morning the whole Italian army of the Mincio
had orders to advance. The soldiers marched with heavy knapsacks and empty
stomachs, and with no more precautions than in time of peace. The Austrian
Archduke was in the saddle at four a.m., and watched from an eminence the
moving clouds of dust which announced the approach of his unsuspecting
foe.</p>

<p>La Marmora's intention had been to occupy the heights of Santa
Giustina, Sona and Somma Campagna, but the Archduke anticipated his
design, and while the Italians were moving from the Mincio, the Austrians
were ranging themselves in those positions. At half-past five on the
midsummer Sunday morning, the Austrian advance guard led by Colonel Pulz
came up with Prince Humbert's division near Villafranca. The battle began
dramatically, with a charge of the splendid Polish and Hungarian Hussars,
who dashed their horses against the Italian squares, in one of which,
opportunely formed for his shelter, was the gallant heir to the throne.
Bixio's division was also engaged in this prelude, which augured not ill
for the Italians, since at about eight o'clock Pulz received the
Archduke's orders to retire.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">
[Pg.368]</a></span> The first hours of the battle were spent in fortuitous
encounters along the extensive chain of hillocks which La Marmora had
intended to occupy. As the Italians approached each position they found it
in the possession of a strong force of the enemy. On the right, however,
Custoza and the heights between it and Somma Campagna had not been
occupied by the Austrians. Here La Marmora placed the flower of his army,
the Sardinian and Lombard Grenadiers, the latter commanded by Prince
Amedeo. The fighting continued through the day over very widely
distributed ground, but from about nine in the morning the supreme
interest was concentrated at and near Custoza, in which the Archduke
promptly detected the turning-point of the battle. To wrest Custoza from
the hold of the Italians was to the Austrians on the 24th of June 1866,
what the taking of the crest of Solferino had been to the French on the
24th of June 1859. La Marmora in person led the Grenadiers into action;
they proved worthy of their reputation, but after losing a great many men,
Prince Amedeo being among the wounded, they were obliged to retreat. At
about midday, however, the Italian prospects improved so much that in the
opinion of Austrian military writers, with moderate reinforcements they
would have had a strong probability of winning the battle. La Marmora saw
the importance of getting fresh troops into the field, but, instead of
sending for the divisions under Bixio and Prince Humbert, which since
eight a.m. had been fretting in inaction close by, at Villafranca, he rode
himself to Goito, a great distance away, to look after the reserves
belonging to the 2nd <i>corps d'arm&eacute;e</i>; a task which any staff
officer could have performed as well. This inexplicable proceeding left
the army without a commander-in-chief. The generals of division followed
their <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">
[Pg.369]</a></span> individual inspirations, Govone, Pianel and Cugia
especially distinguishing themselves: it is sad to think that death has
removed these three officers from the Italian ranks. But the Austrians
fatally gained ground, and as the afternoon closed in the Archduke began
to feel sure that the Italian reinforcements whose arrival he had so much
feared, were never coming. He therefore prepared for the final effort
which was to give him the well-deserved honours of the day. Towards seven
o'clock in the evening, his soldiers succeeded in storming the heights of
Custoza, and Austria could write a second battle of that name among her
victories.</p>

<p>The Italians lost 720 killed, 3112 wounded and 3608 prisoners. The
Austrian loss was 960 killed, 3690 wounded and 1000 prisoners. Both sides
were much tried by the scorching midsummer sun, but the Italians laboured
under the additional drawback of having to fight fasting. In his report,
the Archduke Albrecht mentioned that the prisoners said they had not
tasted food for twenty-four hours. In the same report, he did ample
justice to the courage of the Italian soldiers.</p>

<p>As has been stated, the Archduke fought Custoza with not less, probably
with rather more, than 70,000 men. The force which La Marmora placed in
the field was actually inferior in number. The divisions of Bixio and
Prince Humbert were kept doing nothing all day at a stone's throw from the
scene of action. Of the whole 2nd <i>corps d'arm&eacute;e</i> only a
trifling detachment ever reached the ground. Inexplicably little use was
made of the Italian cavalry.</p>

<p>This bungling had lost the battle, but the fact that on the morrow, six
divisions of the army of the Mincio were practically fresh, might have
suggested to a general of enterprise to try again, since it was known that
the Archduke had not a single new man to fall back on. And <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg.370]</a></span> there was
Cialdini on the Po with his eight divisions that had not been engaged at
all. But, instead of adopting a spirited course, the Italian authorities
gave way to unreasoning panic. It appears, unfortunately, that the King
was the first to be overcome by this moral vertigo. The long and fiercely
discussed question of who telegraphed to Cialdini: 'Irreparable disaster;
cover the capital,' seems to have been settled since that general's death
in 1892. It is now alleged that the telegram, the authorship of which was
disowned by La Marmora, was signed by the King's adjutant, Count Verasio
di Castiglione. Cialdini obeyed the order and fell back on Modena. Whether
he was bound to obey an almost anonymous communication signed by an
irresponsible officer is a moot point; it is reported that he repented
having done so to the last day of his life.</p>

<p>A great event now happened across the Alps; one of the decisive battles
of the world was lost and won on the 5th of July at Sadowa near
K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz in Bohemia. The fate of Europe was shaped on that day
for decades, if not for centuries. Of the immediate results, the first was
the scattering to the wind of all calculations based upon a long
continuance of the war, the issue of which, as far as Prussia was
concerned, could not be regarded as doubtful. In respect to Italy,
Austria's first thought was to prevent her from taking a revenge for
Custoza. She attempted to compass this by ceding Venetia to Napoleon two
days after Sadowa. It was making a virtue of necessity, as she was bound
in any case to cede it at the conclusion of the war; but as the secret of
the treaty had been well kept, the step caused great surprise, and in
Italy, where the public mind had leapt from profound discouragement to
buoyant hope, the impression was one of embarrassment and mortification.
Italy was distinctly precluded by her <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg.371]</a></span> engagement with Prussia from
accepting Napoleon's invitation to conclude a separate peace. Meanwhile,
Austria gained by the move, as it set her at liberty to recall the larger
part of her troops from Venetia for the defence of Vienna. Her honour did
not require her to contest the ground in a province which she had already
given away. When Cialdini, at the head of the reorganised Italian army of
which he now held the chief command, advanced across the Po to Padua, he
found the path practically open.</p>

<p>It was still possible for Italy to accomplish two things which would
have in a great measure retrieved her <i>prestige</i>. The first was to
occupy the Trentino; the second was to destroy the Austrian fleet. With
the means at her disposal she ought to have been able to do both.</p>

<p>In the earlier phases of Italian liberation, no one disputed that if
Lombardy and Venetia were lost to the Empire the Tridentine province,
wedged in as it is between them, would follow suit. When, in 1848, Lord
Palmerston offered his services as mediator between Austria and revolted
Italy, it was on a minimum basis of a frontier north of Trento. The
arguments for the retention of Trieste&mdash;that Austria had made it what
it was; that Germany needed it as a seaport, etc.&mdash;were inapplicable
here; and even after the defeat of Custoza, an occupation of the Trentino,
had it happened in conjunction with a naval victory, would have opened a
fair prospect to possession. But there was no time to lose, and much time
was lost by ordering Garibaldi to descend to the southern extremity of the
lake of Garda to 'cover Brescia' from an imaginary attack. When the fear
of an Austrian invasion subsided, and Garibaldi returned to the mountains,
he endeavoured to re-take the position of Monte Suello which he had
previously held, but the attempt <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_372"
id="Page_372">[Pg.372]</a></span> failed. The volunteers were forced to
retire with great loss, and the chief himself was wounded. On the 16th of
July the volunteers renewed their advance up the mountain ravines, and,
after taking Fort Ampola, reached the village of Bezzecca, where they were
attacked by the Austrians early on the 21st. Each side claimed that
sanguinary day as a victory; the Garibaldians remained masters of the
ground, but the Austrians, in retiring, took with them a large number of
prisoners. The losses of the volunteers on this and other occasions when
they were engaged were disproportionately heavy. They were spendthrift of
their lives, but in war, and especially in mountain warfare, caution is as
needful as courage, and in caution they were so deficient that they were
always being surprised. General Kuhn's numerically inferior force of tried
marksmen, supported by good artillery and favoured by ground which may be
described as one great natural fortification, had succeeded up till now in
holding the Trentino, but his position was becoming critical, because
while Garibaldi sought to approach Trento from the west, Medici with
10,000 men detached from the main army at Padua, was ascending the
Venetian valleys that lead to the same destination from the east. Kuhn was
therefore on the point of being taken between two fires when the armistice
saved him.</p>

<p>These operations on the Tridentine frontier, though not without a real
importance, passed almost unnoticed in the excitement which attended the
first calamitous appearance of United Italy as a naval power.</p>

<p>When invited to assume the command of the Italian fleet, Admiral
Persano twice refused; it was only when the King pressed upon him a third
invitation that he weakly accepted a charge to which he felt himself
unequal. He had been living in retirement for some years, and <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg.373]</a></span> neither
knew nor was known by most of the officers and men whom he was now to
command. The fleet under his orders comprised thirty-three vessels, of
which twelve were ironclads. The Austrian fleet numbered twenty-seven
ships, including seven ironclads. When the war broke out, both fleets were
far from ready for active service; but, while the Austrian Admiral
Tegethoff said nothing, but worked night and day at Pola to make his ships
and his men serviceable, Persano despatched hourly lamentable reports to
the Minister of Marine, without finding the way to bring about a change
for the better. He wasted time in minuti&aelig;, and took into his head to
paint all the Italian ships a light grey, which was of the greatest use to
the Austrians in the battle of Lissa, as it enabled them to distinguish
between them and their own dark-coloured ships.</p>

<p>After long delaying at Taranto, Persano brought his fleet to Ancona;
and, two days later, Tegethoff appeared in front of that town&mdash;not
knowing, it seems, that the Italian squadrons had arrived. Tegethoff was
bound on a simple reconnaissance, and, after firing a few shots, he sailed
away. On this occasion, Persano issued orders so hesitating and confused
that the Austrian admiral must have correctly gauged the capacity of the
man opposed to him, while the superior officers of the Italian fleet were
filled with little less than dismay. A strong effort was made to induce
Depretis to supersede Persano then and there; he promised to do so, but it
is said that the fear of offending the King prevented him. Instead, he set
about showering instructions on the admiral, the worth of which may be
easily imagined. The mistrust felt by the fleet in its commander invaded
all ranks; and if it did not break out in open insubordination, it
deprived officers and men of all confidence in the issue of the
campaign.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">
[Pg.374]</a></span> Left to himself, Persano would have stayed quietly at
Ancona, but the imperative orders of a cabinet council, presided over by
the King, forced him to take some action. Against the advice of Admiral
Albini, but in agreement with another admiral, Vacca, Persano decided to
attack the fortified island of Lissa, on the Dalmatian coast. Though Lissa
is a strong position, the usual comparison of it with Gibraltar is
exaggerated. It ought to have been possible to land the Italian troops
which Persano had with him under cover of his guns, and to take the island
before Tegethoff came up. The surf caused by the rough weather, to which
he chiefly attributed his failure, would not have proved an insuperable
obstacle had the ships' crews been exercised in landing troops under
similar circumstances.</p>

<p>Persano reached Lissa on the morning of the 18th of July, and began a
tremendous bombardment of the forts, which, though answered with the
highest spirit by the Austrians, did most deadly damage to their
batteries. In fact, by the evening, except one or two at a high elevation,
they were practically silenced. At six o'clock Captain Saint Bon took the
<i>Formidabile</i> into the narrow harbour to silence the inner works: a
murderous fire rained on the corvette from Fort Wellington, which was too
high for the Italian guns to get it into range. Though Saint Bon's attempt
was not successful, the Italians had effected most of what they aimed at,
and might have effected the rest had they continued the bombardment
through the night, and so given the Austrians no time to repair their
batteries, but at sunset Persano withdrew his fleet to a distance of eight
miles. The Austrians worked all night at mending the batteries that could
still be used, and hoped <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_375" id=
"Page_375">[Pg.375]</a></span> in the coming of Tegethoff.</p>

<p>The telegraph cable connecting the neighbouring island of Lesina with
the coast, and so with Pola, had been cut by Persano's orders; but either
(as the writer was told on the spot last year) there was another line that
was not noticed, or before the cable was destroyed the official in charge
got off a message to Tegethoff, informing him of the arrival of the
Italian fleet. An answer, to the effect that Tegethoff would come to the
rescue as soon as possible, fell into the hands of the Italians, but
Persano appears not to have believed in it.</p>

<p>The 19th was spent in attempts at landing, which the surf and the
energetic play of the repaired batteries rendered fruitless. The
bombardment was renewed, but it was not well conducted. Saint Bon, who
made another plucky entry into the harbour, was unsupported, and, after an
hour's fighting, he was obliged to retire, his ship having suffered
severely.</p>

<p>Next morning there was a blinding summer storm, but at about eight
o'clock the <i>Esploratore</i> distinguished the forms of ironclads
through the rain, and signalled to Persano: 'Suspicious vessels in sight.'
Persano answered: 'No doubt they are fishing-boats.' When obliged to admit
the truth he gave the order to unite, his ships being scattered in all
directions with everything on board at sixes and sevens. The troops which
had again been attempting to land, were in boats, tossed about by the
heavy sea. The surprise was complete.</p>

<p>Persano fought the battle of Lissa with nine ironclads, most of which
had received some injuries during the bombardment. He ordered his wooden
ships to keep out of the action altogether. Tegethoff had seven ironclads
and fourteen wooden vessels, all of which he turned to the best
account.</p>

<p>Just before the battle Persano left his flagship, the <i>Re</i> <i>
d'Italia</i>, <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">
[Pg.376]</a></span> and went on board the <i>Affondatore</i>. By
somebody's mistake it was a long time before the <i>Affondatore</i>
hoisted the admiral's flag, and the fleet continued to look to the <i>Re
d'Italia</i> for signals when he was no longer on board.</p>

<p>Contrary to a well-known rule in naval science, Persano formed his
squadron in single file, and quite at the beginning of the battle
Tegethoff managed to break the line by dashing in between the first and
second division whilst they were going at full speed, and under a furious
cannonade from their guns. This daring operation placed him in the middle
of the Italian ironclads, which, well directed, could have closed round
him and destroyed him, but they were not directed either well nor
ill&mdash;they were not directed at all. Persano put up contradictory
signals, most of which were not seen, and those which were seen meant
nothing. The plan followed by Admiral Tegethoff may be best described in
his own words: 'It was hard to make out friend from foe, so I just rammed
away at anything I saw painted grey.' Two Italian vessels had been already
damaged, but not vitally injured, by the <i>Ferdinand Max</i>, when in the
dense smoke a vast wall of grey appeared close to the bows of the Austrian
flagship, which, to the cry of 'Ram her!' put on full steam and crashed
into the enemy's flank. The shock was so great that the crew of the <i>
Max</i> were thrown about in indescribable confusion. The Italian ship was
the <i>Re d'Italia,</i> the flagship which did not carry the admiral. She
quivered for one, two, some say for three minutes in her death agony, and
then went down in two hundred fathoms of water.</p>

<p>After the <i>Re d'Italia</i> was struck, one of her seamen, thinking to
assert a claim to pity, began to lower her flag, but a young officer <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg.377]</a></span>
pushed him aside and hoisted it again; so the great ship sank with her
colours flying. The incident was noticed by the Austrians, who spoke of it
in feeling terms. Willing enough were they to help, for after the first
cheer of triumph they felt sick with horror at their own work, the fearful
work of modern naval warfare. There were 550 men on board the doomed ship.
Tegethoff shouted for the boats to be lowered, and signalled to the
despatch boat <i>Elisabeth</i> to pick up all she could, but two Italian
ironclads were bearing down upon him, and little could be done to save the
drowning multitude either by the Austrians or by their own people. Persano
did not know of the disaster till some hours after it happened.</p>

<p>The sea had scarcely closed over the <i>Re d'Italia</i> when another
misfortune occurred; the gunboat <i>Palestro</i> took fire. Her captain,
Alfredo Cappellini, disembarked the sick and wounded, but remained himself
with the rest of the crew, endeavouring to put out the fire. The ship blew
up at 2.30 p.m., and over two hundred perished with her.</p>

<p>Persano, still on the <i>Affondatore</i>, now led his fleet out of
action, and it was the first time he had led it during the day. Tegethoff
gazed after the vanishing squadron with anxiety, as had Persano turned and
renewed the battle from a distance, he could have revenged his defeat at
close quarters without receiving a shot, owing to the longer range of his
guns. But for such an operation skilful manoeuvring was wanted, and also,
perhaps, more precision in firing than the Italian gunners possessed. At
any rate, Persano had no mind for new adventures. He took what remained of
his fleet straight back to Ancona, where the <i>Affondatore</i> sank in
the harbour from injuries received during the battle. For three days the
Italian people were <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_378" id=
"Page_378">[Pg.378]</a></span> told that they had won a victory, then the
bitter truth was known. The admiral, tried before the Senate, was deprived
of his rank and command in the Italian navy. The politician who, when
convinced of his unfitness, yet had not the nerve to remove him from his
post, died, full of years and honours, Prime Minister of Italy.</p>

<p>Lissa was fought on the 20th of July. On the 25th, Prussia signed the
preliminaries of peace with Austria without consulting her ally, who, if
unfortunate, had been eminently loyal to her. Thus the whole forces of the
Empire, not less than 350,000 men, were let loose to fall upon Italy. Such
was the wrathful disappointment of the Italians at their defeats by land
and sea, that if a vote had been taken they would possibly have decided
for a renewal of the struggle. Ricasoli was inclined to risk war rather
than bow to the Austrian demand that the evacuation of the Trentino should
precede the conclusion of an armistice. At this crisis, La Marmora acted
as a true patriot in forcing the hand of the Ministry by ordering the
recall of the troops and sending General Petitti to treat directly with
the Austrian military authorities. 'They will say that we have betrayed
the country,' said the King in the interview in which these measures were
concerted; to which La Marmora answered: 'Come what may, I take the whole
responsibility upon myself.' 'This is too much,' replied Victor Emmanuel
with tears in his eyes; 'I, also, will have my part in it.' In which brief
dialogue the character of the two men stands revealed; men who might fall
short in talent or in judgment, not in honour.</p>

<p>The volunteers, so many of whose comrades lay dead along the mountain
gorges&mdash;who believed, too, that they were in sight of the reward of
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg.379]</a></span>
their sacrifices&mdash;were thrown into a ferment, almost into a revolt by
the order to retreat. They had expected in a day or two to shake hands
with Medici, who, after some hard fighting, was within a march of Trento.
The order was explicit: instant evacuation of the enemy's territory.
Garibaldi, to whom from first to last had fallen an ungrateful part, took
up his pen and wrote the laconic telegram: 'Obbedisco.' 'I have obeyed,'
he said to the would-be mutineers, 'do you obey likewise.' Someone
murmured 'Rome.' 'Yes,' said the chief, 'we will march on Rome.'</p>

<p>The armistice was signed at Cormons on the 12th of August, and the
treaty of peace on the 3rd of October at Vienna. Italy received Venice
from the hands of the French Emperor, whose interference since the
beginning of the campaign had incensed Prussia against her ally without
benefiting the Power which he affected and, perhaps, really meant to
serve. Italy would have received Venetia without his interposition, for
besides the Prussian obligation to claim it for her, Austria had no
further wish to keep it. Despite the fact that Italian populations still
remained under the rule of the Empire, the melancholy book of Austrian
dominion in Italy might be fairly said to be closed forever. A new era was
dawning for the House of Hapsburg, which was to show that, unlike the
Bourbons, it could learn and unlearn.</p>

<p>The comedy of the cession of Venice to Napoleon was enacted between
General Le Boeuf and General Alemann, the Austrian military commandant.
Among other formalities, the French delegate went the round of the museums
and galleries to see that everything was in its place. Suddenly he came
upon a most suspicious blank. 'A picture is <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg.380]</a></span> missing here,' he said. 'It
is, blandly assented the Austrian officer. 'Well, but it must be sent back
immediately&mdash;where is it?' 'In the Louvre.'</p>

<p>At last Austrians and French departed, and Italy shook off her
mourning, for however it had come about, the great object which had cost
so much blood, so many tears, was attained; the stranger was gone! Out of
642,000 votes, only 69 were recorded against the union of Venetia with the
Italian kingdom. When the plebiscite was presented to the King, he said:
'This is the greatest day of my life: Italy is made, though not complete.'
On the 7th of November he entered Venice, and of all the pageants that
greeted him in the hundred cities of Italy, the welcome of the Bride of
the Adriatic was, if not the most imposing, certainly the fairest to see.
More touching, however, than the glorious beauty of the Piazza San Marco
and the Grand Canal in their rich adornment, was the universal decoration
of the poorest quarters, which were all flagged and festooned so thickly
that little could be seen of the stones of Venice. One poor cobbler,
however, living at the end of a blind alley, had no flag, no garland to
deck his abode: he had therefore pasted three strips of coloured paper,
red, white and green, over his door, inscribing on the middle strip these
words, which in their sublime simplicity merit to be rescued from
oblivion: 'O mia cara Italia, voglio ma non posso fare pi&ugrave; per
te.'</p>

<p>The Iron Crown of the Lombard Kings of Italy, which the Austrians had
taken away in 1859, was brought back and restored to the Cathedral of
Monza. Less presumptuous than Napoleon, Victor Emmanuel never placed the
mystical fillet upon his head, but it was carried after his coffin to the
Pantheon.</p>

<h4>THE LAST CRUSADE</h4>

<h5>1867</h5>

<h5>The French leave Rome&mdash;Garibaldi's Arrest and Escape&mdash;The
Second French Intervention&mdash;Monte Rotondo&mdash;Mentana.</h5>

<br />
<p>The words of Victor Emmanuel to the Venetian Deputation contained a
riddle easy to solve: what was meant by the 'completion' of Italy was the
establishment of her capital on the Tiber. In most minds there was an
intense belief in the inevitability of the union of Rome with the rest of
Italy, but no one saw how it was to be brought about. What soothsayer
foretold S&eacute;dan?</p>

<p>In the first period after the war, domestic difficulties fixed the
attention of the Italian Government on the present rather than on the
future. An insurrection at Palermo assumed threatening proportions owing
to the smallness of the garrison, and might have had still more serious
consequences but for the courage and presence of mind shown by the Syndic,
the young Marquis di Rudini. Crime and poverty, republican hankerings, the
irritation of the priesthood at recent legislation, and most of all, the
feeling that little had been done since 1860 to realise the millennium
then promised, contributed to the outbreak which was quelled when troops
arrived from the mainland, but the ministers were blamed for not having
taken better precautions against its occurrence. Another stumbling-block
lay in the path of Ricasoli, <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_382" id=
"Page_382">[Pg.382]</a></span> namely, the application of the law for the
suppression of religious houses, and the expropriation of ecclesiastical
property. After an unsuccessful endeavour to cope with it, he dissolved
the Chamber, but the new Parliament proved no more willing to support his
measures, which were of the nature of a compromise, than the old one, and
he finally resigned office. He was succeeded by Urban Rattazzi, under
whose administration a measure was passed which, though drastic in
appearance, has not prevented the re-establishment of a great many
convents of which the property was bought in under the name of private
individuals. Every Catholic country has seen the necessity sooner or later
of putting a check to the increase of monasticism, but it may be a matter
of regret that in Italy, the toleration granted to the learned community
of Monte Cassino was not extended to more of the historic monasteries. The
abstention of the Clerical party from the voting urns deprived them of an
influence which, on such points as these, they might have exercised
legitimately and perhaps beneficially. To that abstention, the
disequilibrium of Italian political life, from first to last, is largely
due.</p>

<p>The time allowed to the French under the September Convention for the
evacuation of Rome expired in December 1866, and at the opening of the new
year, for the first time since 1849, the Eternal City was without a
garrison in the service of a foreign Power. While executing their
engagement, the French Government took occasion to say that they kept
their hands perfectly free as concerned future action. The anomalous
obligations of the September Convention now came into force, and it was
not long before their inconvenience was felt. Had Ricasoli remained at the
head of affairs the <i>status quo</i> might have lasted for <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg.383]</a></span> a time;
because, although he was an unflinching opponent of the Temporal Power, he
would have made it clear that since the Convention existed he meant to
respect it, and to make others respect it. He had shown that he could
dare, but that was when he bore himself the whole responsibility of his
daring. He was not the man to tolerate heroic imprudence in others with
the mental reservation of owning or disowning the results, as might prove
convenient. Rattazzi, on the other hand, was believed to answer very
closely to this description; and patriots who were willing to bear all the
blame in case of failure and yield all the praise in case of success,
began once more to speculate on the profit to the national cause which
might be extracted from the peculiarities of his character. Aspromonte,
that should have placed them on their guard, had the contrary effect, for
it was supposed that the Prime Minister was very anxious to wipe that
stain from his reputation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Party of Action considered that, for the present, the
wisest course was to wait and watch the development of events. This was
Mazzini's personal view, but Garibaldi, almost alone in his dissent, did
not share it. Impelled partly, no doubt, by the impatience of a man who
sees the years going by and his own life ebbing away without the
realisation of its dearest dream, but partly also by the deliberate belief
that the political situation offered some favourable features which might
not soon be repeated, Garibaldi decided to take the field in the autumn of
1867. His friends, who one and all tried to dissuade him, found him
immovable. It is too much to say that he expected assistance from the
Government, but that he hoped to draw Rattazzi after him is scarcely
doubtful, and he had good <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_384" id=
"Page_384">[Pg.384]</a></span> reason for the hope.</p>

<p>In Rattazzi's own version and defence of his policy, it is set forth
that before the die was cast he did all that was humanly possible to
prevent the expedition, but that having failed, he intended sending the
Italian army over the frontier in the wake of the broken-loose
condottiere. Though this gives a colour of consistency to his conduct, it
is not satisfactory as an explanation, and still less as an apology.</p>

<p>General La Marmora, who had always opposed the Convention, though he
belonged to the party which made it, once declared that 200,000 men would
not be sufficient to hold the Papal frontier against a guerilla invasion.
True as this may be, it is impossible to resist the conclusion that a
minister who had resolutely made up his mind to prevent any attempt from
being made would not have acted as Rattazzi acted. The Prime Minister
thought that he was imitating Cavour, but in reality he simply imitated
the pendulum of a clock.</p>

<p>Rattazzi's taste was for intrigue rather than for adventure in the
grand sense. An adventurous minister would have accelerated the enterprise
to the utmost, in secret or not in secret, and would then have preceded
Garibaldi to Rome before the Clerical party in France had time to force
Napoleon to act. The rest could have been left to the Roman people. What
they did in 1870 they would have done in 1867; they were ready to acclaim
any conquering liberator; they were not ready to make a revolution on
their own account, and with all their leaders in prison or in exile, they
are hardly to be blamed for it. For such a policy Italy might have pleaded
that necessity which knows no law. Everybody allowed that if Garibaldi
went to Rome the Italians must go there too: the very security of the Pope
demanded it&mdash;at least, he said so. As to the first part of the
programme, complicity <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_385" id=
"Page_385">[Pg.385]</a></span> in the preparation of the movement, it
would have been an infringement of the Convention, but had France kept the
Convention? French bishops recruited soldiers for the Pope in every
province of France, and the Antibes Legion was drawn, officers and men,
from the French army. When some of the men deserted, the French War Office
sent General Dumont to Rome to look to the discipline of the regiment.
Those who argued that the spirit, if not the letter, of the agreement had
been already evaded, could make out a good case for their position.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that this is what Rattazzi's policy would have
been, but for the opposition of the King. Were it so, the minister ought
to have resigned at the beginning of the proceedings instead of at the
end. That in the ultimate crisis it was the King who prevented the troops
from moving is a fact, but the propitious moment was then past and gone.
'Do as you like, but do it quickly,' Napoleon said to Cavour when Cialdini
was to be sent to the Cattolica. And it was done quickly.</p>

<p>After letting Garibaldi make what arrangements and issue what
manifestoes he chose for six weeks, Rattazzi suddenly had him arrested at
Sinalunga on the 23rd of September. The only consequence was fatal delay;
not knowing what to do with their prisoner, the Government shipped him to
Caprera. Personally he was perfectly free; no conditions were imposed; but
nine men-of-war were despatched to the island to sweep the seas of erratic
heroes. In spite of which, Garibaldi escaped in a canoe on the 14th of
October.</p>

<p>That night, between sundown and moonrise, there was only one hour's
dark, but it sufficed the fugitive to make good his passage from <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg.386]</a></span>
Caprera to the island of Maddalena. A strong south-east breeze was
blowing; the waves, however, were rather favourable to the venture, as
they hid the frail bark from any eyes that might be peering through the
night. Garibaldi did not fear; he had often put out on this terrible sea
when lashed to fury to succour sailors in their peril. On reaching
Maddalena he scrambled over the rocks to the house of an English lady who
was delighted to give him hospitality. Next evening he proceeded to
Sardinia, from which, after several adventures, he sailed for the Tuscan
coast in a boat held in readiness by his son-in-law, Canzio. And so, to
the amazement of friends and foes, he arrived in Florence, where, before
many hours were past, he was haranguing the enthusiastic crowd from a
balcony.</p>

<p>Garibaldi had escaped, but the mischief done to the movement by the
loss of nearly a month could not be remedied. Although large armed bands
under Acerbi, Nicotera and Menotti Garibaldi were gathered near Viterbo,
as usually happened in the absence of the chief, nothing effectual was
done. But it was in Paris that the delay brought the most ruinous
results.</p>

<p>The history of the second French expedition to Rome will never be
satisfactorily told, because, while the outward circumstances point one
way, the inward probabilities point another. Napoleon had said that if the
Convention were not observed he would intervene, and he did intervene;
nothing could seem simpler. Yet it is not doubtful that, in his inmost
heart, he was wishing day and night that something would turn up to
extricate him from the Roman dilemma once for all. While he hesitated, the
Clerical party in France did not hesitate. Not a moment was thrown away by
them. Towards the middle of October, it was reported that 'half royalist
and half Catholic France will be in <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg.387]</a></span> Rome in the course of the
week. Men with names belonging to the proudest French nobility&mdash;the
De Lusignans, De Clissons, De Lumleys, De Bourbon-Chalens, etc., are
chartering vessels, arriving in Rome by scores and hundreds, and hence
hurrying to the front to take their places as privates in the Zouaves.'
That, however, does not describe the most important sphere of their
activity which was the ante-chamber, nay, the boudoir of St Cloud. In that
palace, three years later to be rased to the ground by the Germans, the
net was woven which every day closed tighter and tighter round Napoleon,
till he was enveloped in its meshes past escape. Ever since De Morny's
death, the influence nearest the throne had been increasing in strength;
it is needless to say in which direction it was exercised. Napoleon was
ill; Maximilian's ghost floated over him; he felt his power slipping from
his hands in spite of the noise and show of the Exhibition, which was
supposed to mark its zenith. The words of the old pact with the Royalists
buzzed in his ears: 'Do you keep the Pope on his throne, and we will keep
you on yours.' And he yielded.</p>

<p>The 'principle' of French intervention was adopted by the council of
ministers on the 17th of October. Then, and not till then, Rattazzi
decided to send the Italian troops over the frontier. On finding that
neither the King nor several of his colleagues in the ministry would
support him, he resigned office on the 19th of the month.</p>

<p>It was on the day after that Garibaldi appeared in Florence. As there
was no ministry, no one thought it his business to interfere with him.
Cialdini, whom the King had requested to form a cabinet, did go and ask
him to keep quiet till there was some properly qualified person to arrest
him; but this, not unnaturally, he declined to do. He left <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg.388]</a></span> Florence by
special train for Terni, whence he crossed the frontier and joined the
insurgent bands near Rome.</p>

<p>From the 19th to the 26th, Napoleon again and again ordered and
countermanded the departure of the transports from Toulon. On the last
date the final order was given and the ships started. The news must have
just reached Paris that the King had called upon General Menabrea to
undertake the task which had been abandoned by Cialdini, whose name
recalled Castelfidardo too strongly to have a sound welcome either in the
Vatican or at St Cloud. When Napoleon heard that Menabrea was to be
Rattazzi's successor, he knew that there was no fear that the new
Government, carried away by the popular current which was manifestly
having its effect on the King, should, after all, order the Italian army
to the front. Menabrea, the Savoyard who in 1860 chose the Italian
nationality which his son has lately cast away, was the old opponent of
Cavour in the Turinese chamber, and of all Italian politicians he was the
most lukewarm on the Roman question. All chance of a collision between the
French and Italian armies was removed. Menabrea did occupy some positions
over the Papal frontier, it would be hard to say with what intention,
unless it were to appear to fulfil a sort of promise given by the King
during the ministerial interregnum. The troops were ordered on no account
to attack the French, and as soon as the Garibaldian campaign was at an
end, they were brought home. It was not worth while to send them with
their hands tied to almost within earshot of where other Italians were
fighting and falling. Menabrea's attitude towards the volunteers was
immediately revealed by the issue of a royal proclamation, in which <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg.389]</a></span> they
were declared rebels. The French were free to act.</p>

<p>All this time the revolution in Rome, which it was admitted on all
sides would have gone far towards cutting the knot, did not begin. Besides
the cause already assigned, the absence of the heads, there was another,
the almost total lack of arms. To remedy this, Enrico and Giovanni
Cairoli, with some seventy followers, tried to take a supply of arms up
the Tiber to Rome. Only the immense importance of the object could have
justified so desperate an attempt. Obliged to abandon their boats near
Ponte Molle, they struck off into the Monti Parioli, where they were
attacked, within sight of the promised land, at a spot called Villa
Gloria. Their assailants were three times their number, and those who were
not killed were carried prisoners to Rome. Among the killed was the
captain of the band, who fell in the arms of his young brother. As Enrico
Cairoli lay dying, the French Zouaves (was this the chivalry of France?)
charged the two brothers with their bayonets, piercing Giovanni with ten
wounds, from injuries arising from one of which he expired a year later,
after long torments. 'Dastardly French!' cried Enrico with his last
breath. They were the third and fourth sons of Adelaide Cairoli who died
for their country. One only of her five children remained to stand by her
own death-bed&mdash;Benedetto, the future Prime Minister, and saviour of
King Humbert from the knife of an assassin.</p>

<p>The Papal army was composed of 13,000 men, General de Courten
commanding the portion of it which could be spared out of Rome. The
Breton, Colonel Charette, had charge of the Zouaves. Since the French
garrison left, much trouble had been taken to make this force efficient.
Under Garibaldi's own orders there were between 7000 and 8000 volunteers.
Those who have made a higher estimate have included <span class="newpage">
<a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg.390]</a></span> other bands which,
either from the difficulty of provisioning a larger number, or from want
of time for concentration, remained at a distance.</p>

<p>The chief's arrival soon infused new life into the camp. On the 24th he
moved towards Monte Rotondo, one of the castellated heights near Rome,
which commands the Nomentane and Tiburtine ways to the south, and the
railway and Via Salara to the west. It was generally considered the most
important military position in the Papal states. The garrison was small,
but, perched as they were on a hill crest which looks inaccessible, the
defenders might well hope to hold out till help came from Rome. They had
artillery, of which the volunteers had none, and the old castle of the
Orsini, where they made their principal stand, was well adapted for
defence. From the morning of the 25th till midnight, the Garibaldians
hurled themselves against the walls of the rock town without making much
way; but at last the resistance grew weak, and when the morning light
came, the white flag was seen flying. At four in the afternoon of the 26th
a Papal column tardily arrived upon the scene, but they perceived that all
was over at Monte Rotondo, and, after firing a few musket shots, they fled
to Rome in disorder.</p>

<p>Garibaldi rode into the cathedral, where he fixed his quarters for the
night. In Italy churches have ever been applied to such uses. After the
reduction of Milan, Francesco Sforza rode into the Duomo, and when King
Ladislaus of Naples conquered Rome, he rode into the basilica of St John
Lateran. The guerilla chief bivouacked in a confessional, while his
Red-shirts slept where they could on the cathedral floor. Four hundred of
them had been killed or wounded in the assault.</p>

<p>The prisoners of war were brought before Garibaldi, who praised their
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg.391]</a></span>
valour and sent them under an escort to the Italian frontier. Two or three
were retained for the following reason. Garibaldi had heard of the
Cairolis' heroic failure, and after his victory his first thought was of
them and of their sorrowing mother. He asked Signora Mario if there were
any notabilities among the Papal prisoners. She mentioned Captain
Quatrebras and others, and he sent her into Rome on a mission to the Papal
commander with a view to exchanging these prisoners for the wounded
Giovanni and for his brother's body. The proposal was accepted, and the
compact kept after Mentana had changed the aspect of affairs.</p>

<p>'Garibaldi at the gates!' was the news that spread like wildfire
through Rome on the evening of the 26th of October. Terror, real terror,
and no less real joy filled all hearts; but the sides were soon to be
reversed. Another piece of news was not long in coming: 'The French at
Civita Vecchia!'</p>

<p>The French arrived on the 29th, and on the same day Garibaldi advanced
almost to the walls of Rome, still hoping for a revolutionary movement to
break out within the city; but the information which he then received
deprived him finally of this hope, and he gave the order to return to
Monte Rotondo. Volunteers have the defect of being soldiers who <i>
think</i>; on this occasion they thought that the backward march was the
beginning of the end&mdash;that, in short, the game was up. A third of the
whole number deserted, and took the road towards the Italian frontier.
Garibaldi himself seems to have had a first idea of crossing into the
Abruzzi, and there waiting to see what turn events would take; but he did
not long entertain it, and, when he again left Monte Rotondo, it was with
the fixed design of fighting a battle. He expected, however, to fight the
Papal troops alone, and not the French.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">
[Pg.392]</a></span> This was very nearly being the case. On the 1st of
November, the Papal General Kanzler called on General De Failly at Civita
Vecchia, and found him, to his concern, by no means anxious to rush into
the fray. Even when sending the troops, Napoleon seems to have hoped to
escape from being seriously compromised. He probably thought that the
moral effect of their landing would cause Garibaldi to retire, and that
thus the whole affair would collapse. But the Papal authorities did not
want it to collapse; they wanted more bloodshed, and if the words which
express the ungarnished truth as acknowledged by their own writers and
apologists, sound indecent when describing the government of the Vicar of
Christ, it only shows once more the irreconcilability of the offices of
priest and king in the nineteenth century. Kanzler insisted that a
crushing blow must be inflicted on the volunteers before they had time to
retreat. He argued so long and so well that De Failly promised him a
brigade under General Polh&egrave;s to aid in the attack which he proposed
to make on Monte Rotondo.</p>

<p>The Papal forces left Rome by Porta Pia, and took the Via Nomentana,
which leads to Monte Rotondo by Mentana. They were on the march at four
o'clock a.m. Garibaldi had ordered his men to be ready at dawn on the same
day (it was the 3rd of November); but Menotti suggested that, before they
started, there should be a distribution of shoes, a consignment of which
had just reached the camp. Many of the volunteers were barefoot, which
gives a notion of their general equipment. Garibaldi, who rarely took
advice, yielded to his son. Had he not done so, before the Papal army
reached Mentana, he would have been at Tivoli. One delay brings another,
and it was midday when the march <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_393"
id="Page_393">[Pg.393]</a></span> began. Garibaldi looked sad, and spoke
to no one, but hummed some bars of Riego's hymn, the Spanish song of
freedom, full of a wild, sweet pathos, to which his tanned-faced
legionaries had marched under the Monte Videan sun. Could he but have had
with him those strong warriors now! He mounted his horse, put it to a
gallop, which he rarely did, and, riding down the ranks of the column,
took his place at its head. When he arrived at the village of Mentana, he
heard that the Pontificals were close by, and he waited to give them
battle.</p>

<p>Mentana lies in a depression commanded by the neighbouring mounds, not
a good configuration for defence. This village in the Roman Campagna
sprang into history on a November day one thousand and sixty-seven years
before, as the meeting-place of Charlemagne and Leo III. Here they shook
hands over their bargain: that the Pope should crown the great Charles
Emperor, and that the Emperor should assure to the Pope his temporal
power. And now the ragged band of Italian youths was come to say that of
bargains between Popes and Emperors there had been enough.</p>

<p>They numbered less than 5000. General De Failly reckoned the Papal
troops engaged at 3000 and the French at 2000, but Italian authorities
compute the former at a higher figure. The most experienced of the
Garibaldian officers thought that the attackers were twice as numerous as
they were. At the first onslaught great confusion prevailed among the
volunteers. Mentana seemed lost, but the sound of the guns they had
captured at Monte Rotondo restored their <i>moral</i>, and making a
gallant rush forward they retook the principal positions with the bayonet.
As they saw the Pontificals swerve back they uttered cries of joy. It was
two o'clock. The enemy's fire slackened; something was going on which the
volunteers could not make out. All at once there <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg.394]</a></span> was a sharp unfamiliar
detonation, resembling the whirring sound of a machine. The French had
come into action.</p>

<p>A hailstorm of bullets mowed down the Garibaldian ranks. Their two guns
were useless, for the ammunition, seventy rounds in all, was exhausted.
They fought till four o'clock&mdash;till nearly their last cartridge was
gone; then they slowly retreated. Very few of them guessed what that
peculiar sound meant, or imagined that they had been engaged with the
French, but next morning Europe knew from General De Failly's report that
'the Chassepots had done wonders.'</p>

<p>Garibaldi left the field, haggard and aged, unable to reconcile himself
to a defeat which he thought that more discipline, more steadiness in his
rank and file, would have turned into a victory. He had always demanded
the impossible of his men; till now they had given it to him. In time he
judged more justly. Those miserably-armed lads who lately had been glad to
eat the herbs of the field, if haply they found any, stood out for four
hours against the pick of two regular armies, one of which was supposed to
be the finest in the world. They had done well.</p>

<p>Mentana remained that night in the hands of 1500 Garibaldians, who
still occupied the castle and most of the houses when the general retreat
was ordered. In the morning the Garibaldian officer who held the castle
capitulated, on condition that the volunteers 'shut up in Mentana' should
be reconducted across the frontier; terms which the French and Papal
generals interpreted to embrace only the defenders of the castle. Eight
hundred of the others were taken in triumph to Rome. It would have been
wiser to let them go. The Romans had been told that <span class="newpage">
<a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg.395]</a></span> the Garibaldians were
cut-throats, incendiaries, human bloodhounds waiting to fly at them. What
did they behold? 'The beast is gentle,' as Euripides makes his captors say
of Dionysius. The stalwart Romans saw a host of boys, with pale, wistful,
very young-looking faces. If anything was wanting to seal the fate of the
Temporal Power it was the sight of that procession of famished and wounded
Italians brought to Rome by the foreigner.</p>

<p>The victors, however, were jubilant. Their inharmonious shouts of <i>
Vive Pie Neuf</i> vexed the delicate Roman ears. It was the battle-cry of
the day of Mentana. Begun by the masked, finished by the unmasked soldiers
of France, Mentana was a French victory, and it was the last.</p>

<p>The Garibaldian retreat continued through the night to Passo Corese on
the Italian frontier. The silence of the Campagna was only broken by
little gusts of a chilly wind off the Tiber; it seemed as if a spectral
army moved without sound. Garibaldi rode with his hat pressed down over
his eyes; only once he spoke: 'It is the first time they make me turn my
back like this,' he said to an old comrade, 'it would have been better
...' He stopped, but it was easy to supply the words: 'to die.'</p>

<p>As he was getting into the train at Figline, with the intention of
going straight to Caprera, he was placed under arrest by order of the
Italian Government. His officers had their hands on their swords, but he
forbade their using force. The arrest seemed an unnecessary slight on the
beaten man, who had loved Italy too well. But General Menabrea, who
ordered it, believes that he thereby saved Italian unity. According to an
account given by him many years after to the correspondent of an English
newspaper, Napoleon wrote at this juncture <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg.396]</a></span> to King Victor Emmanuel, that
as he was not strong enough to govern his kingdom, he, Napoleon, was about
to help him by relieving him of all parts of it except Piedmont, Lombardy
and Venetia. The arrest of Garibaldi, by showing that the King 'could
govern,' averted the impending danger. In communicating it to Napoleon,
the King is said to have added 'that Italians would lose their last drop
of blood before consenting to disruption,' a warning which he was not
unlikely to give, but the whole story lacks verisimilitude. It appears
more credible that an old man's memory is at fault than that a letter, so
colossally insolent, was actually written. Menabrea, and even the King,
may have feared that something of the kind was in the mind of the
Emperor.</p>

<p>As after Aspromonte so after Mentana; Garibaldi was confined in the
fortress of Varignano, on the bay of Spezia. A few weeks later he was
released and sent to Caprera. As he left the fortress-prison he wrote the
words: 'Farewell, Rome; farewell, Capitol; who knows who will think of
thee, and when?'</p>

<p>The last crusade was over; destiny would do the rest.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<h4>ROME, THE CAPITAL</h4>

<h5>1867-1870</h5>

<h5>M. Rouher's 'Never'&mdash;Papal
Infallibility&mdash;S&eacute;dan&mdash;The Breach in Porta Pia&mdash;The
King of Italy in Rome.</h5>

<br />
<p>Mentana had its epilogue in the debate in the French Corps
L&eacute;gislatif, which lasted from the 2nd to the 5th of December. Jules
Favre proposed a vote of censure on the Ministry for their Roman policy.
The most distinguished speaker who followed him was Thiers, who said that
though in opposition, he would support the Government tooth and nail in
their defence of French interests at Rome. The debate was wound up by the
memorable declaration of the Prime Minister, Rouher, that 'never' should
Italy get possession of Rome. 'Is that clear?' he asked. It was quite
clear. The word escaped him, he afterwards said, in 'the heat of
improvisation.' The French Chamber confirmed it by throwing out Favre's
motion by 237 votes against 17.</p>

<p>Now, indeed, the Ultramontanes were jubilant throughout the world.
Napoleon was compromised, enmeshed beyond extrication.</p>

<p>Of all these events, Prussia, or rather the great man who was the brain
of Prussia, took attentive note. He was convinced that the wonders
accomplished by the Chassepot at Mentana would soon lead France to try the
effect of the new rifle on larger game. Among the <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg.398]</a></span> measures which he took
with a view to that contingency, his correspondence with Mazzini is not
the least remarkable. It began in November 1867, and was continued for a
year. The object of both Bismarck and Mazzini was to prevent Italy from
taking sides with France. The negotiations were carried on partly through
Count d'Usedom, Prussian Minister at Florence, and partly through other
intermediaries. Mazzini began by saying, that although the Chancellor's
methods of unification had not his sympathy, he admired his energy,
tenacity and independence; that he believed in German unity and opposed
the supremacy which France arrogated to herself in Europe. He engaged to
use his influence in Italy to make it difficult for an Italian Government
to take up arms for the victors of Mentana. Bismarck was well aware that
in speaking of his influence the writer used no idle phrase, but possibly
one of his reasons for continuing the correspondence was to find out what
Mazzini knew of the hidden plots and counter plots then in manufacture
both in Paris and at Florence, because the Italian was more conversant
with diplomatic secrets than any man living, except, perhaps, Cardinal
Antonelli. In April 1868, Mazzini received through the Prussian Embassy at
Florence, a document which even now possesses real interest on the
relative advantages to Italy of a French or German Alliance. The whole
question turned, observed the Prussian Chancellor, on the mastery of the
Mediterranean: here France and Italy must find themselves at variance
whether they willed it or not. 'The configuration of the terrestrial globe
not being amenable to change, they will be always rivals and often
enemies.' Nature has thrown between them an apple of discord, the
possession of which they will not cease to contest. The Mediterranean
ought to become an Italian lake. 'It is impossible for <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg.399]</a></span> Italy to
put up with the perpetual threats of France to obtain the mastery over
Tunis, which would be for her the first stage to arriving in
Sardinia.'</p>

<p>At the Berlin Congress eight years later, Prince Bismarck pressed the
same views upon Count Corti, the Italian delegate. He would have been glad
to see the Italians go to Tunis, but Count Corti ingenuously replied: 'You
want to make us quarrel with France.' Meanwhile the Englishman who
represented France and the Englishman who represented England were
discussing the same subject, and out of their discussion arose the French
occupation of Tunis. Disquieting rumours got about at once, but they were
dispelled. 'No French Government would be so rash,' said Gambetta, 'as to
make Italy the <i>irreconcilable</i> foe of France.' M. Waddington
declared that he was personally opposed to the acquisition of Tunis, and
gave his word of honour that nothing would be done without the full
consent of Italy. What was done and how it was done is known to all. And
so it happens that a great French naval station is in course of
construction almost within sight of Sicily <i>and of Malta.</i></p>

<p>In the document communicated by Bismarck to Mazzini, there is a curious
inclusion of Trieste among Italian seaports which seems to indicate that
he was still not averse from a rectification of the Italian north-east
frontier. Whence it may be supposed that he expected to find Austria
ranged on the part of France in the struggle for the Rhine bank. To
explain how it was that this did not happen, we must leave the Chancellor
and the Revolutionist, and see what at the same time was going on between
Napoleon on the one side and Austria and Italy on the other.</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">
[Pg.400]</a></span> The French Emperor was not so infatuated as to court
the risk of making war on Prussia single-handed if he could avoid it. He
hoped for a triple alliance of France, Austria and Italy, or, if that
could not be compassed, a dual alliance of France with either of these
Powers. Now, wisely or unwisely, both the Italian and Austrian Governments
were far from rejecting these proposals off-hand. The secret negotiations
lasted from 1868 till June 1869. They took the shape of informal letters
between the King of Italy and Napoleon, and of private communications with
Count Beust through Prince Metternich, the Austrian Ambassador in Paris,
who was the intimate friend and confidant of the Emperor and Empress.
General Menabrea was not let into the secret till later. With regard to
Victor Emmanuel, there is no doubt that he wished with all his heart to be
able to do a good turn to his Imperial ally of 1859 if the occasion
presented itself. Some men see their wives even to old age as they saw
them when they were young and fair. The first print on the retina of the
mental vision was so strong that no later impression can change or efface
it. This hallucination is not confined to the marital relationship, and
Victor Emmanuel never left off seeing Napoleon in one sole light: as the
friend of Solferino. It may be that he perceived what the Italians did not
perceive: that the obligation was owed to Napoleon alone, while all France
had a part in the subsequent injuries. At any rate the idea of refusing
the Emperor's appeal was repugnant in the extreme to the Italian King, who
personally would have strained any point rather than give that
refusal.</p>

<p>The King, however, and General Menabrea, who was finally admitted into
the conspiracy, could not be blind to the fact that an unpopular war might
create so great an agitation in the country that the dynasty itself would
be in danger. A war for France while the French were in <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg.401]</a></span> Rome would
have raised one storm of indignation from Palermo to Turin. So their
ultimatum was this: Rome capital of Italy, or no alliance.</p>

<p>There remained Austria, but if Napoleon ever hoped to conclude a
separate treaty with her, he was to discover his mistake. From the moment
that Austria resigned the Iron Crown, the symbol of her Italian power, she
acted towards Italy with a loyalty that has few parallels in history. And
she, too, replied to Napoleon: Rome capital of Italy, or no alliance.</p>

<p>The Vatican has never forgiven this to Austria. At the present hour,
while republican France with her open antagonism to all religion, is the
favoured daughter of the Church, Austria, the only country in Europe
except Spain where the Roman Catholic cultus retains all its original pomp
and almost all its medi&aelig;val privileges, meets from the Vatican a
studied plan of opposition, the object of which can only be to bring her
Government to a deadlock. From France the Pope still hopes for aid in the
recovery of his temporalities; from Austria he knows that he will never
receive it. So much have politics and so little has religion to do now, as
in all ages, with the motives that govern the Holy See.</p>

<pre>
     Ahi, Costantin, di quanto mal fu matre
       Non la tua conversion, ma quella dote

</pre>

<p>The years 1868 and 1869 passed uneventfully for Italy. In the former
year Prince Humbert married his cousin Margherita of Savoy. He was
previously engaged to the Archduchess Matilda, the only daughter of the
Victor of Custoza, but the young Princess met with a terrible death just
when the betrothal was about to be announced. No one <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg.402]</a></span> worthier to
receive from Adelaide of Burgundy the lovely title of Queen of Italy could
have been found than the Princess Margaret, who inherited the sunny charm
which had endeared her father, the Duke of Genoa, to all who knew him.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1869 another domestic event, the severe illness of
Victor Emmanuel, gave rise to an incident which made a deep impression in
Italy, and attached the nation by one link more to the King of its choice.
The illness which seized Victor Emmanuel at his hunting-box of San
Rossore, in a malarious part of Tuscany, proved so serious that his life
was despaired of. A priest was called to hear the King's last confession,
and to administer the Sacraments for the dying. After hearing the
confession, the priest said he could not give absolution unless Victor
Emmanuel signed a solemn retractation of all the acts performed during his
reign that were contrary to the interests of the Church. The King
answered, without a moment's hesitation, that he died a Christian and a
Catholic, and that if he had wronged anyone he sincerely repented and
asked pardon of God, but the signature demanded was a political act, and
if the priest wished to talk politics his ministers were in the next room.
Thither the ecclesiastic retired, but he very soon returned, and
administered the rite without more ado. What had passed was this: General
Menabrea, with a decision for which he cannot be too much praised,
threatened the priest with instant arrest unless he surrendered his
pretensions. Only those who know the extraordinary terror inspired in an
Italian Catholic by the prospect of dying unshriven can appreciate the
merit of the King, whose faith was childlike, in standing as firm in the
presence of supernatural arms as he stood before the Austrian guns.</p>

<p>Menabrea's administration was then upon the eve of falling. The cause
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg.403]</a></span>
was one of those financial crises that were symptomatic of a mischief
which has been growing from then till now, when some critics think they
see in it the fatal upas tree of Italy. The process of transforming a
country where everything was wanting&mdash;roads, railways, lines of
navigation, schools, water, lighting, sanitary provisions, and the other
hundred thousand requirements of modern life&mdash;into the Italy of
to-day, where all these things have made leaps almost incredible to those
who knew her in her former state, has proved costly without example.
During the whole period it has been necessary to spend in ever-increasing
ratio on the army and navy, and this expenditure, though emphatically not
the chief, has yet been a concomitant cause of financial trouble. The
point cannot be inquired into here of how far greater wisdom and higher
character in Italian public servants might have limited the evil and
reconciled progress with economy; but it may be said that if the path
entered upon by the man who took charge of the exchequer after Menabrea's
fall, Quintino Sella, had been rigorously followed by his successors, the
present situation would not be what it is.</p>

<p>Giovanni Lanza assumed the premiership in the government in which Sella
was Minister of Finance. Both these politicians were Piedmontese, and both
were known as men of conspicuous integrity, but Lanza's rigid conservatism
made it seem unlikely that the Roman question would take a fresh turn
under his administration. In politics, however, the unlikely is what
generally happens; events are stronger than men.</p>

<p>On the 8th of December the twenty-first Ecumenical Council assembled in
Rome. From the day of its meeting, in spite of the strenuous opposition of
its most learned and illustrious members, there was no <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg.404]</a></span> more doubt
that the dogma under consideration would be voted by the partly astute and
partly complaisant majority than that it would have been rejected in the
twenty preceding Councils. On the 18th of July 1870, the Pope was
proclaimed Infallible.</p>

<p>That was a moment of excitement such as has not often thrilled Europe,
but the cause was not the Infallibility of Pius IX. On the 16th, Napoleon
declared war with Prussia. War, like death, comes as a shock, however
plainly it has been foreseen; besides, it was only the well-informed who
knew how near the match had been to the powder-magazine for two years and
more. Whether the explosion, at the last, was timed by Napoleon or by
Bismarck is not of great importance; it could have been but little
delayed. Napoleon was beset alike by the revolutionary spectre and by the
gaunt King of Terrors; he knew the throw was desperate, but with the
gambler's instinct, which had always been so strong in him, he was
magnetised by it because it was desperate. Pitiful egotist though he was,
history may forgive him sooner than it forgives the selfish Chauvinism of
Thiers, who had been goading his countrymen to war ever since Sadowa, or
the insane bigotry of the party which, having triumphed over revolution at
Mentana, now sought to triumph over heresy in what the Empress called 'Ma
guerre.'</p>

<p>Napoleon had the remaining sagacity to see the extreme danger of
leaving a few thousand men isolated in Rome at a time when, happen what
might, it would be impossible to reinforce them. Directly after declaring
war, notwithstanding the cries of the Ultramontanes, he decided on
recalling the French troops. He induced the Italian Government to resume
the obligations of the September Convention, by <span class="newpage"><a
name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg.405]</a></span> which the inviolability
of the Papal frontier was guaranteed. Lanza is open to grave criticism for
entering into a contract which it was morally certain that he would not be
able to keep. Perhaps he hoped that Napoleon would himself release Italy
from her bond. But the 'Jamais' of Rouher stood in the way. Could the
Emperor, after such boasting, coolly throw the Pope overboard the first
time it suited his convenience? Moreover, his present Prime Minister, M.
Emile Olivier, when the question was put to him, did not hesitate to renew
the declaration that the Italians must not be allowed to go to Rome.</p>

<p>Napoleon made some last frantic efforts to get Austria and Italy to
befriend him unconditionally. How far he knew the real state of his army
before he declared war may be doubtful, but that he possessed overwhelming
proof of it, even before the first defeats, cannot be doubted at all. His
heart was not so light as his Prime Minister's. At the end of July he sent
General T&uuml;rr on a secret mission to try and obtain the help of
Austria and Italy. The Hungarian general wrote from Florence, that unless
something could be done to assure Italy that the national question would
be settled in accordance with the wishes of her people, the Italian
alliance was not possible. The Convention, he pointed out, was a bane
instead of a boon to Italy. This letter was answered by a telegram through
the French Ambassador at Vienna: 'Can't do anything for Rome; if Italy
will not march, let her stand still.</p>

<p>As in the former negotiations, Austria took her stand on precisely the
same ground as Italy. And thus it was that France plunged into the
campaign of 1870 single-handed.</p>

<p>After W&ouml;rth, and once more after Gravelotte, the endeavour to draw
<span class="newpage"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg.406]</a></span>
Italy into the struggle was renewed. Napoleon was aware that Victor
Emmanuel was wildly anxious to come to the rescue, and on this personal
goodwill his last hope was built. Prince Napoleon was despatched from the
camp at Ch&acirc;lons to see what he could do. At this eleventh hour (19th
August) Napoleon was ready to yield about Rome. At the camp, the influence
which guided him in Paris was less felt, or it is probable that he would
not have yielded even now. Prince Napoleon carried a sheet of white paper
with the Emperor's signature at the foot. He showed it to Lanza when he
reached Florence, and told him to fill it up as he chose. Whatever he
asked for was already granted. A month before, such terms would have won
both Italy and Austria&mdash;not now.</p>

<p>The Prince found his father-in-law eager to give the 50,000 men that
were asked for, but the ministers protested that the Italian army was
unprepared for war. Still, to satisfy the King, who signified his
irritation so clearly to Lanza that this good servant was on the point of
resigning, they agreed to submit the case to Austria; if Austria would
co-operate, they would re-consider their decision. Austria replied: 'Too
late.'</p>

<p>When, in 1873, Victor Emmanuel paid a visit to Berlin, he caused some
sensation at a grand State banquet by saying to his host: 'But for these
gentlemen' (and he waved his hand towards the ministers who accompanied
him) 'I should have gone to war with you.' Courtiers did not know which
way to look, but the aged Emperor was not displeased by the soldierly
bluntness of the avowal.</p>

<p>Prince Napoleon remained in Florence, throwing away his eloquence, till
the 2nd of September cut short the argument. When he had left his cousin,
the Emperor was resolved to fall back on Paris according to <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg.407]</a></span> MacMahon's
plan, but the ministers and the Empress Regent forced him to his doom. On
the 2nd of September S&eacute;dan was lost; on the 4th the Empire
fell.</p>

<p>'And to think,' exclaimed Victor Emmanuel when he heard the news, 'that
this good man was always wanting to give me advice!'</p>

<p>From the date of the declaration of war, and still more since the
evacuation of Rome by the French troops (begun on the 29th of July, ended
on the 19th of August), Italy had been too deeply agitated for any sane
person to suppose that the prescriptive right of the nation to seize the
opportunity which offered itself of completing its unity could be resisted
by the artificial dyke of a compromise which made the Government the
instrument of France. Lanza was determined to maintain order; he had
Mazzini arrested at Palermo, and suppressed disorders where they occurred,
but the rising tide of the will of the people could not be suppressed, and
had the ministry resisted it, something more than the ministry would have
fallen.</p>

<p>In justification of Lanza's slowness to move, and of the apparent, if
not real, unwillingness with which he took every forward step, it is
contended that more precipitate action would have caused what most people
will agree would have been a misfortune for Italy, the departure of the
Pope from Rome. It was only on the 20th of August that the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Visconti-Venosta, sent a memorandum to the European
Powers which announced that the Government had decided on occupying Rome
at once. A week after, the fall of the Empire came as a godsend to the
ministry which had possibly hardly deserved such a stroke of luck. They
were no longer hampered by the September Convention, because the September
Convention was dead. This <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_408" id=
"Page_408">[Pg.408]</a></span> was amply admitted by Jules Favre, though
he declined to denounce the treaty formally; even a French Radical, in the
hour of setting up the Republic, was afraid to proclaim aloud that France
renounced all claim to interfere in her neighbour's concerns.</p>

<p>Of the other Powers, Switzerland signified her approval, and the rest
engaged to abstain from any opposition.</p>

<p>The King addressed a letter to the Pope, in which, with the affection
of a son and the faith of a Catholic, he appealed to his spirit of
benevolence and his Italian patriotism to speak the word of peace in the
midst of the storm of war that was distracting Europe, and to accept the
love and protection of the people of Italy in lieu of a sovereignty which
could not stand without the support of foreign arms. Pius IX. merely
answered by saying that the letter was not worthy of an affectionate son,
and that he prayed God to bestow upon His Majesty the mercy of which he
had much need. To the bearer of the royal appeal, Count Ponza di San
Martino, he said that he might yield to violence, but would never sanction
injustice.</p>

<p>This was about the time that the Pope, on his side, wrote an appeal
not, be it observed, to any Catholic monarch, but to King William of
Prussia, who would certainly not have read unmoved the complaint of one
who, like himself, was crowned with white hairs, but Count Bismarck took
the precaution of causing the letter not to reach his master's hands till
the Italians were in Rome.</p>

<p>The day following the Pope's interview with Count Ponza, the 11th of
September, the Italian troops received the order to enter the Papal
states. For several weeks five divisions under General Cadorna had been in
course of concentration along the frontier; this force now marched on
Rome. Bixio was sent to Civita Vecchia where resistance was <span class=
"newpage"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg.409]</a></span> expected,
and had been ordered by Kanzler, but the native element prevailed over the
foreign in the garrison, and the Spanish commandant, Colonel Serra,
interpreting the wishes of the Roman troops, surrendered without firing a
shot.</p>

<p>Great was the indignation of the French and Belgian Zouaves. They were
resolved that the same thing should not happen in Rome. That there was a
chance of avoiding bloodshed may be inferred, from Count Arnim's numerous
journeys between the Vatican and General Cadorna's headquarters outside
Porta Salara; the Prussian representative hoping till the last moment to
arrange matters in a pacific sense. Cardinal Antonelli is said to have
been nearly persuaded, when he received a message from Colonel Charette in
these terms: 'You had better go and say mass while we look after defending
you.' The war party so far carried the day that the Pope adhered to his
plan of 'sufficient resistance to show that he yielded only to force.'</p>

<p>At half-past five on the morning of the 20th of September, all attempts
at conciliation having failed, the Italian attack was opened upon five
different points, Porta San Pancrazio, Porta San Giovanni Laterano, Porta
San Lorenzo, Porta del Popolo and Porta Pia. General Maze de la Roche's
division attacked the latter gate, and the wall near it, in which a breach
was rapidly effected by the steady fire of the Italian batteries, though
it was not till past eight o'clock that it seemed large enough to admit of
an assault. Then the 41st of the line, and the 12th and 34th Bersaglieri
were ordered up, and dashed into the breach with the cry of 'Savoia!
Savoia!' The challenge was returned by the Zouaves with their 'Vive Pie
Neuf.' They had been already ordered to desist, as the Pope's instructions
were clear, 'to stop when a breach was made;' but on the plea that the
order was sent <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">
[Pg.410]</a></span> to them verbally they continued firing. When the
written order came, they displayed a white handkerchief fastened to a
bayonet, and at this point the fight was over. Hundreds of Roman exiles
poured through the breach after the soldiers; 15,000 of them had arrived
or were arriving at the gates of the city.</p>

<p>At the same time the white flag was hoisted on Porta Pia, but on the
advance of the 40th Regiment and a battalion of Bersaglieri, shots were
fired which killed and wounded several officers and men; when they saw
their companions falling, the troops could not be restrained from scaling
the barricade which had been formed to defend the gate, and surrounding
and capturing the Zouaves who were behind it. The whole Diplomatic Corps
now came out in full uniform to urge General Cadorna to effect the
occupation as quickly as possible, that order might be maintained. By
midday, the Italian troops had penetrated into most parts of the city left
of the Tiber; as yet there was no formal capitulation on the part of the
Zouaves, and their attitude was not exactly reassuring. This did not
prevent the population, both men and women, from filling the streets and
greeting the Italians with every sign of rejoicing. They cheered, they
wept, they kissed the national flag, and the cry of <i>Roma Capitale</i>
drowned all other cries, even as the fact it saluted closed the discords
and the factions of ages.</p>

<p>In the afternoon all the Papal troops were persuaded to lay down their
arms, which, in the case of the foreigners, were given back to them. Next
day they were reviewed by General Cadorna. As the Italians presented arms
to the retiring host, some of the Antibes Legion shouted at them: 'We are
French, we shall meet you again.' The Roman troops were sent to their
homes; the foreigners conducted to the <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg.411]</a></span> frontier, Charette and other
of the French officers went to the battlefields of their prostrate
country, and thus it came to pass that the Pope's defenders were found
fighting side by side with Garibaldi; they, indeed, only doing their
simple duty, but he, acting on an impulse of Quixotic generosity which was
repaid&mdash;the world knows how!</p>

<p>Cadorna received three pressing requests from the Pope to occupy the
Leonine City, and the third he granted. The idea of leaving the part of
Rome on which the Vatican stands under the Pope's jurisdiction had been
long favoured by a certain class of politicians, and Lanza made a last
effort to give it effect by excluding the Leonine City from the plebiscite
which was ordered to take place in Rome and in the Roman province on the
2nd of October. It was in vain. The first voting urn to arrive at the
Capitol on the appointed day was a glass receptacle borne by a huge
Trasteverino, and preceded by a banner inscribed: 'Citt&agrave; Leonina
Si.' As the Government had not supplied the inhabitants with an official
urn, it occurred to them to provide themselves with an unofficial one in
which they duly deposited their votes. The Roman plebiscite yielded the
results of 133,681 affirmative and 1507 negative votes.</p>

<p>In December the Italian Parliament met for the last time in the Hall of
the Five Hundred. 'Italy,' said the King in the speech from the throne,
'is free and united; it depends on us to make her great and happy.' Of
this last session at Florence the principal labour was the Act embodying
the Papal guarantees which was intended to safeguard the legitimate
independence and decorum of the Holy See on the lines formerly advocated
by Cavour. Neither extreme party was satisfied, but it seemed at first not
unlikely that the Pope would tacitly acquiesce in the arrangement. The
first monthly payment of the national <span class="newpage"><a name=
"Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg.412]</a></span> dotation, calculated to
correspond with his civil list, was accepted. But though the influence of
Cardinal Antonelli and the Italian prelates had been sufficient to keep
the Pope in Rome, the influence of those who wished him to leave it was
strong enough to establish at the Vatican the intransigent policy which
has been pursued till now.</p>

<p>During the flood of the Tiber which devastated the city that winter,
the King of Italy paid a first informal visit to his capital, accompanied
only by a few attendants, and bent on bringing help to the suffering
population. In July 1872, he made his solemn entry, and at the same time
the seat of Government was transferred to the Eternal City.</p>

<hr />
<p>Victor Emmanuel could say what few men have been able to say of so
large a promise: 'I have kept my word.' He gathered up the Italian flag
from the dust of Novara, and carried it to the Capitol. In spite of the
grandeur of republican tradition in Italy, and the lofty character of the
men who represented it during the struggle for unity, a study of these
events leaves on the mind the conviction that, at least in our time, the
country could neither have been freed from the stranger nor welded into a
single body-politic without a symbol which appealed to the imagination,
and a centre of gravity which kept the diverse elements together by giving
the whole its proper balance. The Liberating Prince whom Machiavelli
sought was found in the Savoyard King. 'Quali porte se gli serrerebbono?
Quali popoli gli negherebbono la obbedienza? Quale invidia se gli
opporrebbe? Quale Italiano gli negherebbe l'ossequio?' To fill the
appointed part Victor Emmanuel possessed the supreme qualification, which
was patriotism. Though he <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_413" id=
"Page_413">[Pg.413]</a></span> came of an ambitious race, not even his
enemies could with any seriousness bring to his charge personal ambition,
since every step which took him further from the Alps, his fathers'
cradle, involved a sacrifice of tastes and habits, and of most that made
life congenial. When his work was finished, though he was not old, he had
the presentiment that he should not long survive its completion. And so it
proved.</p>

<p>In the first days of January 1878, the King was seized with one of
those attacks on the lungs which his vigorous constitution had hitherto
enabled him to throw off. But in Rome this kind of illness is more fatal
than elsewhere, and the doctors were soon obliged to tell him that there
was no hope. 'Are we come to that?' he asked; and then directed that the
chaplain should be summoned. There was no repetition of the scene at San
Rossore; the highest authority had already sanctioned the administration
of the Sacraments to the dying King, nay, it is said that the Pope's first
impulse was to be himself the bearer of them. At that hour the man got the
better of the priest; Francis drove out Dominic. The heart that had been
made to pity and the lips that had been formed to bless returned to their
natural functions. When the aged Pius heard that all was over, exclaimed:
'He died like a Christian, a Sovereign and an honest man (galantuomo).'
Very soon the Pope followed the King to the grave, and so, almost
together, these two historical figures disappear.</p>

<p>Six years before, solitary and unsatisfied, Mazzini died at Pisa, his
heart gnawed with the desire of the extreme, as the hearts have been of
all those who aspired less to change what men do, or even what they
believe, than what they are. More deep than political regrets was the pain
with which he watched the absorption of human energies, in the <span
class="newpage"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg.414]</a></span> race
for wealth, for ease, for material happiness; he discerned that if the
egotism of capital led to oppression, the egotism of labour would lead to
anarchy. To the end he preached the moral law of which he had been the
apostle through life. His last message to his countrymen, written when the
pen was falling from his hand, was a warning to Italian workingmen to
beware of the false gods of the new socialism. When others saw darkness he
saw light; now, Cassandra-like, he saw darkness when others saw light; yet
he did not doubt the ultimate triumph of the light, but he no longer
thought that his eyes would see it, and he was glad to close them.</p>

<p>Less sad, notwithstanding his physical martyrdom, were Garibaldi's last
years. Italy showed him an unforgetting love; when he came to the
continent, the same multitudes waited for him as of old, but instead of
cheers there was a not less impressive silence now, lest the invalid
should be disturbed. Soon after the transfer of the capital he went to
Rome to speak in favour of the works by which it was proposed to control
the inundations of the Tiber, and it was curious to hear it said on all
sides that, of course, the Tiber works must be taken in hand as Garibaldi
wished it. Pius IX. summed up the situation wittily in the remark: 'Lately
we were two here; now we are three.' The old hero invoked the day when
bayonets might be turned into pruning-hooks, but he by no means thought
that it had arrived, and in the meanwhile he urged the Italians to look to
their defences, and above all, 'to be strong on the sea, like England.' In
the matter of government he remained the impenitent advocate of the rule
of one honest man&mdash;call him Dictator or what you please, so he be
one! Garibaldi died at Caprera on the 2nd of June 1882. The play was
ended, the actors <span class="newpage"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">
[Pg.415]</a></span> vanished:</p>

<p>A new epoch has begun which need not detain the chronicler of Italian
Liberation. The prose of possession succeeds the poetry of desire.
Nothing, however, can lessen the greatness of the achievement. With regard
to the future, it may be allowable to recall the superstition which, like
so many other seemingly meaningless beliefs, becomes full of meaning when
read according to the spirit: that a house stands long if its foundations
be watered with the blood of sacrifice. No work of man was ever watered
with a purer blood than the restoration of Italy to the ranks of living
nations. And the last word of this book shall be Hope.</p>

<p>It is now Carlyle's turn to be aspersed. Let Mazzini speak for him from
the grave: 'I do not know if I told you,' he wrote to the Marchesa
Eleonora Curlo Ruffini, in a letter published a few months ago, 'that I
have met upon my path, deserted enough, I hope, by choice, a Scotchman of
mind and things, the first person here, up till now, with whom I
sympathise and who sympathises with me. We differ in nearly all opinions,
but his are so sincere and disinterested that I respect them. He is good,
good, good; he has been, and I think he is still, unhappy in spite of the
fame which surrounds him; he has a wife with talent and feeling; always
ailing; no children. They live out of town, and I go to see them every now
and then. They have no insular or other prejudices that jar upon me. I
have grown more intimate with this man in consequence, I think, of an
article I wrote here, after knowing him, against an historical work of
his; perhaps, accustomed as he is to common-place praise, to which he is
indifferent, my frankness pleased him. For the rest I shall see him
rarely, and I can only give him esteem and the warmest sympathy&mdash;not
friendship, which I can henceforth give to no one.' (22nd March 1840.)</p>

<p>Of Garibaldi's foreign officers, Colonel (afterwards General) Dunne was

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
