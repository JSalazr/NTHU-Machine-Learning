<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>Of all the illustrious families who have shone like gems upon
the earth's surface, none have been more distinguished in their way
than the Lazybones family; and were I so disposed I might recount
their virtues and trace their talents from a long-forgotten period.
But interesting as the study might prove, it would be a difficult
task, and the attention I crave for Prince Leo would be spent on
his ancestors.</p>
<p>Of princely blood and proud birth, Leo was a youth most
simple-minded. He knew that much was expected of him, and that he
was destined to rule; yet so easily was he satisfied that his
greatest happiness was to lie all day basking in the sun or
dawdling through his father's park with his dog at his heels, the
heels themselves in a very down-trodden state of humility,
<!-- Page 18 --><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>watching with
languid gaze the movements of the world about him.</p>
<p>And the world just where he lived was very beautiful. On a
fertile plain, surrounded by mountain-peaks of great height,
threaded by silver streams, and so well watered that its vegetation
was almost tropical, was the estate of Leo's father, Prince
Morpheus Lazybones. It had been in the family for ages, and was so
rich in timber and mineral resources that none of its owners had
cared to cultivate the land. Timber was cut sparingly, however,
because the market for it was too distant, and the minerals
remained in their native beds for much the same reason.</p>
<p>The family throve, notwithstanding, and were well supplied with
all manner of delicacies, for the servants were many, and there was
never a lack of corn or wine.</p>
<p>Leo was most fair to see. To be sure, his drooping lids half
concealed his azure eyes, and his golden locks sometimes hid his
snowy forehead; but his smile was charming; his face had such an
expression of calm satisfaction, such a patient tranquillity, that
his smile was as the sudden sunshine on a placid lake. It was the
<!-- Page 19 --><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>smile of the
family, an inherited feature, like the blue hood of a Spanish Don.
And then it was given so freely: the beggar would have preferred it
to be accompanied with the jingle of a coin, but as the coin never
came and the smile did, he tried to think that it warmed his heart,
though his wallet went empty.</p>
<p>There were those who said a smile cost nothing, else it would
not have been bestowed. It had a peculiarity of its own which these
same critics also objected to&mdash;it nearly always ended in a
yawn.</p>
<p>But Leo heard none of these ill-natured remarks, and, if he had,
would not have minded them any more than he did the burs which
clung to his garments as he rambled through the woods. Poor fellow!
he would gladly have shared his coppers with a beggar, but he had
none to share.</p>
<p>Morpheus Lazybones never seemed to think his son required
anything; so long as the boy made no demands, surely nothing could
be wanting, and every one knew <i>he</i> was not equal to any
exertion. For years he had lived the life of an invalid, shut up in
his room most of the time, venturing from it only in the sunniest
weather, and then with great caution. He had no particular malady
except that he was a poet, but surely that was burden enough. To
have to endure the common sights and sounds of this earth when one
is composing poetry is indeed a trying and troublesome thing. So
Morpheus found it, and therefore he frequently stayed in bed, and
allowed his fancy to rove at its own sweet will.</p>
<p>They lived in what had been a monastery. There had been houses
and farms on the Lazybones property, but the money not being
forthcoming for repairs, they had been each in turn left for
another in better condition, until the monastery&mdash;what was
left of it&mdash;with its solidly built walls, offered what seemed
to be a permanent home.</p>
<p>Here Morpheus lined a cell with tapestries and books, and wrote
his sonnets. Here Leo slept and ate, and housed his dogs. The
servants grumbled at the damp and mould, but made the chimneys roar
with blazing logs, and held many a merry carousal where the old
monks had prayed and fasted. The more devout ones rebuked these
proceedings, and said they were enough to provoke a visit from the
Evil One; but as yet the warning had no effect, as the revels went
on as usual.</p>
<p>Besides being a poet, Morpheus was conducting Leo's education.
Undertaken in the common way, this might have interfered with the
delicate modes of thought required for the production of poems, but
the Lazybones were never without ingenuity. Morpheus so arranged
matters that Leo could study without damage to his father's poems.
The books were marked for a month's study, and Leo's recitations
consisted of a written essay which was to comprise all the
knowledge acquired in that time. Thus writing and spelling were
included, and made to do duty for the higher flights of his
mind.</p>
<p>I do not tell how often Leo made his returns, neither do I
mention how many papers Morpheus found no time to examine, but I
may urge that Leo's out-door exercise demanded much attention, and
that his father's excursions in Dream-land were equally exacting.
But Leo, though he hated books, did not hate information. He knew
every feathered thing by name as far as he could see it. He knew
every oak and pine and fir and nut tree as a familiar friend. He
knew every rivulet, every ravine, every rabbit-burrow. The streams
seemed to him as melodious as the song-birds, and the winds had
voices. He knew where to find the first blossom of spring and the
latest of autumn, the ripest fruit and most abundant vines. He
could tell just where the nests were and the number of eggs,
whether of the robin or the waterfowl. He knew the sunniest bank
and shadiest dell, the smoothest path, with its carpet of
pine-needles and fringe of fern, or the roughest crag and darkest
abyss. He could read the clouds like an open page, and predict fine
weather or the coming storm. He knew where the deer couched and
where they came to drink, and when the fawns would leave their
mothers, and no trout was too cunning for him.</p>
<p>But he did not know the use of a rifle. He had all sorts of
lures for the creatures he wanted to tame, but no ways of killing
them. For why should he kill them? There was always food enough; he
was seldom hungry, and these were his friends. He liked to look
them in the eyes; he liked to win them to him, soothe their fears
if they had any, and then watch their pretty joy when their liberty
was regained. And how could he have done this if their blood had
been upon his hands? How could he have quieted the throbbing little
hearts if murder had been in his own?</p>
<p>Thus Leo spent his time, delightfully and innocently. If life
were only a summer's day! But already winter was approaching.
Discontent was brewing on the estate. Taxes were unpaid; tenants
were grumbling at high rents; laborers were threatening and their
wives complaining.</p>
<p>Frequently, in the very midst of composing a poem, Morpheus
would be called to adjust a difficulty, settle a dispute, or revise
an account. This so disturbed his delicate nerves that illness, or
the appearance of it, was sure to follow. He would then take to his
bed, refuse all but a little spiced wine, allowing no coarse food
to pass his lips, and strive to remember the beautiful words of
which he had intended to make verses; but, alas! the words had
flown, as well as the ideas which had suggested them, like so many
giddy little butterflies.</p>

<h4><!-- Page 20 --><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>CHAPTER
II</h4>
<p>The monastery had been a grand old pile in its day; it was not
one simple building, but a cluster of habitations which had grown
with the growth and resources of the order which founded it. Like
all feudal structures it had its means of defence&mdash;its moat
and drawbridge, its tower of observation, and in its heavy gates
and thick walls loop-holes and embrasures for weapons.</p>
<p>But grass grew now in the moat and birds nested in the
embrasures, while Leo's dogs bounded through chapel and refectory
and cloister, parts of the latter being converted into a
stable.</p>
<p>Many of the walls had tumbled in hopeless confusion, but those
of the buildings yet in use had carved buttresses and mullioned
windows, on which much skill had been displayed.</p>
<p>Leo knew, or thought he knew, every nook and cranny of his home,
for when it rained, or heavy fogs hung threateningly about, his
rambles were confined to the various quarters of the monastery.</p>
<p><!-- Page 21 --><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>On such days
the stone floors and bare walls were very inhospitable, but he
would sometimes find a new passage to loiter in or a window-ledge
to loll over and look from as he watched the rain drip from the
carved nose of an ugly old monk whose head adorned the
water-spout.</p>
<p>I don't know whether it ever occurred to Leo that this world is
a busy one. The very persistence of the pouring rain might have
suggested it, as well as the beehives down in the kitchen court,
where some of his many friends were storing their winter provision,
for bees as well as birds were familiar to him; but he had the true
Lazybones instinct of not following a thought too far, and so he
looked and lolled and yawned, wishing for fine weather, for a new
lining to his ragged old coat, or soles to his slipshod shoes, but
never once supposing that any effort of his own could gain
them.</p>
<p>When it was cold the kitchen was apt to be his resort. It was a
long and low apartment on the ground-floor, and its wide fireplace,
with stone settle beside the hooks and cranes for pots and kettles,
had doubtless been as cheery a corner for the old monks to warm
their toes after a <!-- Page 22 --><a name="Page_22"
id="Page_22"></a>foraging expedition as it was for Leo, who liked
to smell the savory stews.</p>
<p>On the day of which I write the rain had fallen incessantly, and
Leo had been more than usually disturbed by it, for cold and dreary
though it was, the servants had turned him out of the kitchen. They
would not have him there.</p>
<p>"Idle, worthless fellow!&quot; said the cook; "he lolls about as a
spy upon us, to repeat to the master every word he hears.&quot;</p>
<p>This was quite untrue and unjust, for Leo rarely conversed with
his father, and seldom saw him since Morpheus took his meals as
well as his woes to bed with him, as he had done at the present
moment.</p>
<p>But the household was in revolt; the uneasiness from outside had
crept within, and there was quarrelling among the servants.</p>
<p>&quot;What shall I do?&quot; said Leo to himself. &quot;The rain is too heavy,
or I would go out in it; but I have no place to get dry when I
become soaked, and I can't go to bed in the daytime, as my father
does. I wonder what he'd say if I went to him? Probably this: 'You
have given wings to the finest of rhymes, and spoiled the
<!-- Page 23 --><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>turn of an
exquisite verse; now, sir, what atonement can you make for so great
an injury? It's the world's loss, remember.' That's the way it
always is when I disturb him. Heigh-ho! what a dull day!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A very dull day indeed, your highness.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo started, his yawn ending abruptly, and he turned more
quickly than he had ever done in his life towards the sound which
saluted him. Surely he had been alone. Who ever came to this
corridor? He looked up and down its dingy length, but saw no one.
He must have been mistaken. Then he listened. The wind swept
wailing through its accustomed approaches; shutters and windows
shook with the blast, but no footfall was to be heard. He turned to
the diamond-paned lattice, and again watched the drops trickling
from the nose of the water-spout. No one had spoken. Again he
yawned prodigiously, but brought his jaws together with a snap
which might have damaged his teeth; for, to his great surprise, a
voice said,</p>
<p>&quot;I think I could amuse you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And pray who are you?&quot; asked Leo, feeling very queer, and as if
he were talking to himself.</p>
<p><!-- Page 24 --><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>&quot;That is of
little consequence, so long as I do what I have proposed,&quot; was the
reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Very true,&quot; said Leo; &quot;but I never before heard of a ghost in
the daytime.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am no ghost, your highness; I'd scorn to be such a useless
thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you, then, and where are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will find out what I am after a while; and as to where I
am, why, I am here beside you. Do you suppose you human beings have
all the world to yourselves?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not quite, to be sure; the birds and beasts have their share.
But one can see them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So could you see me if your vision were not imperfect. How
about all the living things you swallow every time you drink?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard of something of the kind, but it was too much
trouble to understand it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor boy! It's a pity some old ghost of a monk could not
interest himself in your education; but, as I said before, ghosts
are absurdly useless, except to scare people whose consciences are
bad, and nothing more is needed to make me doubt their existence
than the fact of your living here in what should be their
stronghold, and <!-- Page 25 --><a name="Page_25"
id="Page_25"></a>they never raise hand or foot to help you. It's
quite in keeping with their ridiculous pretensions. Believe in
ghosts? No, I never did, and I never will.&quot;</p>
<p>The voice, small and weak though it was, grew quite angry in
tone, and it seemed to Leo as if it were accompanied by the stamp
of a foot; but he saw nothing, not so much as a spider crawling
over the stone corridor.</p>
<p>It was very peculiar. He pinched himself to see if he was awake.
Yes, wide-awake, no doubt of that; besides, he seldom
dreamed&mdash;indeed, never, unless his foot had slipped in
climbing a crag to peep into a nest, when the fall was sometimes
repeated in his sleep. Who was this speaking to him? As if in
answer to his thoughts, the voice went on:</p>
<p>&quot;So far from being a good-for-nothing old ghost, I am one of the
founders of the S.P.C.C., a very old society&mdash;much older than
people of the present day imagine.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo was quite ashamed to be so ignorant, but he ventured to
ask,</p>
<p>&quot;What is the S.P.C.C.?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it possible you have never heard of it?&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 26 --><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>&quot;Never,&quot;
replied Leo, still feeling as if he were talking to the walls.</p>
<p>There was a queer little gurgling &quot;Ha! ha!&quot; which was at once
suppressed.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, how could you know away off in this remote region?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure I don't understand you at all,&quot; said Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I see you don't; and it's by no means remarkable. You live
so entirely alone, and are so wretchedly neglected, that it is a
wonder you know anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo began to be angry, but it was too much of an effort;
besides, what was there to be angry at&mdash;a voice? So he
remained sulkily silent until the voice resumed, in a changed
tone:</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your highness's pardon; I quite forgot myself. I am very
apt to do that when I am much interested; it is a great fault, for
I appreciate fine manners. But to explain. In the faraway cities
where people live like ants in an ant-hill, all crowded together,
there is often much cruelty and oppression, as well as vice and
poverty. Now for this state of things they have laws and
punishments, means of redress; but they relate principally to grown
people's affairs; so <!-- Page 27 --><a name="Page_27"
id="Page_27"></a>the kind-hearted ones, noticing that little
children are often in need of pity and care and protection, have an
association called the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children. It is as old as the hills, but they think it a modern
invention. I am one of the original founders of that society,
little as they know me; but human beings are <i>so</i> vain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; said Leo, lazily; he was already tired of the whole
matter.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, vain and pretentious. Look at your father and his poems;
he thinks his doggerel verses a mark of genius.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What has my father done to you that you attack him so rudely?&quot;
asked Leo, angrily.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! you are aroused at last. I am glad. What has your father
<i>not</i> done, you had better ask. But I acknowledge that I am
rude, and I won't say more than just this: Your father has failed
to prepare you for your duties. Trouble is coming, and how are you
to meet it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't know, and don't care,&quot; came out with characteristic
Lazybones indifference.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! my dear Prince, do not speak so; it is quite time you knew
and cared. Do you study geography?&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 28 --><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>&quot;Sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All surface work, I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now my plan of study comprehends an interior view of the
earth's formation.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo gave a tremendous yawn, and said,</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, please don't bother any more; I am awfully tired.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I should think. Well, do you want to be amused?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; I don't want anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come with me, then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No matter where; just do as I bid you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can I, when I don't even see you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True. It will be necessary to anoint your eyes; shall I do
it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just as you please.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo felt a little pressure forcing down his eyelids, and the
pouring of a drop of cool liquid on each.</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes again there stood before him the
quaintest, queerest being he had ever beheld.</p>

<h4><!-- Page 29 --><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>CHAPTER
III</h4>
<p>Leo had heard of kobolds and gnomes and elves, but in all his
wanderings over the Lazybones estate in the brightness of noon, the
dewy dawn, or dusky eve, or later when the moon bathed every shrub
in silver, he had never so much as caught a glimpse of fairy
folk.</p>
<p>Here, however, was a real elf&mdash;a most peculiar person. He
was extremely small, thin, and wiry, about two and a half inches
high, and his costume a cross between that of a student or
professor and that of a miner, for on his bushy head was a miner's
cap with a lantern, and on his back was a student's gown, while his
thin legs were incased in black silk stockings, and his feet in
rough hobnailed boots. Slung over one shoulder was a leather bag,
and in his hand was a curious sort of a tool.</p>
<p>&quot;The Master Professor Knops has the honor of saluting Prince Leo
Lazybones,&quot; was the way in which this extraordinary person
introduced himself, making at the same time a deep bow and a
military salute, but with no raising of the cap from which the
little lantern gleamed with <!-- Page 30 --><a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30"></a>a bright blue flame. Leo returned the salutation
with a lazy grace, smiling curiously upon the queer little object
before him, who proceeded to say:</p>
<p>&quot;And now let us go; I lead&mdash;you follow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forward, then,&quot; responded Leo, rising from his lounging
attitude.</p>
<p>The elf went nimbly down the corridor, as if accustomed to it,
and paused before a door which led to a flight of stone steps.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going down cellar?&quot; asked Leo, who knew where the
stairs led.</p>
<p>&quot;I am,&quot; replied Knops; &quot;but these huge doors and heavy hinges
bother me. Be so good as to open and close them for me. By-the-way,
you may get hungry; shall we find food down here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps so,&quot; said Leo, following, and doing as requested.</p>
<p>They went down step after step, and it was wonderful how much
light came from that little blue flame.</p>
<p>On skipped the elf, his gown puffing out, his nailed boots
pattering over the stones, and Leo found himself quite breathless
when they reached the cellar, so unused was he to any rapidity of
movement.</p>
<p><!-- Page 31 --><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>&quot;Suppose we
meet some one,&quot; said Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;And what have we to fear if we do? No one can see me, and if
you are afraid of a scullion or house-maid you are not the Prince I
take you for. Tut! tut! don't be afraid&mdash;come on.&quot;</p>
<p>The cellar was damp, and great curtains of cobwebs, like gray
lace, fell over the empty bins and wine-vaults. From a heap of
winter vegetables Leo filled his pockets with apples and
turnips.</p>
<p>They came at last to a door which Leo remembered having opened
once, but finding that it led to a passage which was dark, dismal,
and unused, he had not cared to explore it. He now followed the elf
through it, but not without misgivings, for as he groped along he
stepped on a round object which, to his horror when the little blue
flame of the elf's lantern revealed its empty sockets and grinning
jaws, proved to be a skull.</p>
<p>Knops turned with a smile when he saw Leo's agitation, and said,
blandly,</p>
<p>&quot;You are not interested in this form of natural history, I see.&quot;
Then taking up the skull, he placed it in a crevice of the wall,
saying, &quot;Here is another proof that there are no ghosts about.
<!-- Page 32 --><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>Do you think any
one would be so careless of his knowledge-box as to leave it to be
kicked around in that way? Oh, those old monks were miserable
house-keepers; the idea of stowing away their skeletons so near
their kitchen closets!&quot;</p>
<p>Leo smiled faintly, and went on after Knops, who every once in a
while gave a tap on the walls with his tool, starting the
echoes.</p>
<p>&quot;There!&quot; said he, &quot;do you hear that? This is the way we make old
houses haunted. I don't do it for fun, as do the elves of folly. I
have a sensible purpose; but they like nothing better than to
frighten people, and so they make these noises at all hours, and
get up reports that a house is bewitched; but even a common insect
like the cricket can do that, human beings are such ridiculous
cowards.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo made an effort to assume the courage which he did not feel,
and asked his guide how much farther he intended to lead him.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Knops, stopping, and putting on an air of intense
gravity, as if he were about to deliver a lecture, &quot;I must beg you,
my dear Prince, to place perfect confidence in me. I promised not
to harm you. As a member of the <!-- Page 33 --><a name="Page_33"
id="Page_33"></a>S.P.C.C., I am pledged to protect you; besides,
you have no idea how much I am interested in you; this expedition
has been planned entirely for your benefit. Trust me, then, and
give yourself entirely up to my control. Ask as many questions as
you wish, provided they are useful ones. Just say, without
ceremony, 'Knops, why is this? or, Knops, what is that?' and I, in
return, if you will be so good as to allow me, will say, frankly,
'Leo, this is this,' or 'that is that.' But here is the entrance to
our habitations. You will have to stoop a little.&quot; Striking again
with his tool, a panel slid open in the wall, through which they
crept.</p>
<p>It was still dark, but the air had changed greatly; instead of
the musty dampness of a vault, there was a soft warmth, which was
fragrant and spicy, and a beam as of moonlight began to illuminate
the passage, which broadened until they stood at its termination,
when Leo found himself on a ledge or gallery of rock, which was but
one of many in the vast cavern which opened before them.</p>
<p>On its floor was burning an immense bonfire, which flashed and
flamed, and around which was a bevy of dwarfs, shovelling on fuel
from <!-- Page 34 --><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>huge heaps
of sandal-wood. Every gallery swarmed with elves and dwarfs in all
sorts of odd costumes, but all bore little lanterns in their caps,
and tools in their hands. Some were hammering at great bowlders,
others with picks were working in passages similar to the one Leo
had left, and others seemed to be turning lathes, sharpening
knives, cutting and polishing heaps of brilliant stones. Every once
in a while a party of queer little creatures much smaller than
Knops would trundle in wheelbarrows full of rough pebbles, and
dumping them down before those employed in cutting and polishing,
would be off again in a jiffy for another load.</p>
<p>Leo was so astonished that he stood perfectly silent, gazing now
at the flashing fire which reflected from all sides of the
brilliant quartz of the cavern, and now at the tier upon tier of
galleries full of busy little people.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one of our workshops,&quot; said Knops, &quot;but not the most
important. Now that you have rested a moment I will take you to
that.&quot;</p>
<p>Line upon line of red and green in rubies and emeralds were at
the base of the grotto, and then he found that the emeralds sprang
up into long grasses, and the rubies into flaming roses, and
<!-- Page 35 --><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>on slender
spears were lilies of pearls and daisies of diamonds, and blending
with these were vines of honeysuckle and strawberries, gleaming
with sapphires and topaz and amethysts, wreathing and flashing up
to a ceiling of lapis lazuli blue as a June sky. The floor was a
mosaic of turquoise forget-me-nots on a turf of Egyptian
jasper.</p>
<p>When Leo had looked at all this bewildering beauty, Knops pushed
open the mica door again, and they began to traverse the galleries
of the rock cavern. He was surprised that none of the elves noticed
him, nor even looked at him, and he asked Knops the reason.</p>
<p>&quot;I have rendered you invisible to them, my dear Leo, for two
reasons: one is that you may be undisturbed in your examination of
their work, and the other is that they may not be interrupted; for
of course your presence would be a source of lively interest to
them, and yet any stoppage of work would necessitate
punishment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Punishment?&quot; repeated Leo, questioningly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes; most of our hardest workers are elves of mischief and
it is only by keeping them thus constantly employed that we prevent
<!-- Page 36 --><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>disorder. You
have no idea what pranks they play.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what is your authority among them?&quot; asked Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;I am one of our King's cabinet; my title is Master Professor.
My learning qualifies me to decide upon the plans of work, where to
search for precious stones, and how best to prepare them for man's
finding. Nothing is more amusing than the wonder and surprise men
exhibit at what they consider their discoveries of minerals and
gems, when for ages we have been arranging them for their clumsy
hands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you do this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! it's a long story. Here you see the result of our long
searches, and were it not for the processes we conduct none of
these stones would ever be found. We can penetrate where man has
never been; we can construct what man has in vain tried to do. Come
with me to our diamond-room: we do not make many, preferring to
find them; but as an interesting scientific experiment we have
always liked to test our ability.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying, Knops turned down a little lane
<!-- Page 37 --><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>lighted by what
looked like small globes of white fire.</p>
<p>&quot;Electric light,&quot; said Knops, with a gesture of disdain, as he
saw Leo blinking with wonder&mdash;&quot;The commonest sort of a blaze;
and yet men have nearly addled their brains over it, while we made
it boil our kettles. It's the simplest and cheapest fuel one can
have; but having utilized it so long, I am on the lookout for
something new. Here, this is the way;&quot; and again he opened a mica
door.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER IV</h4>
<p>Blow-pipes and retorts, crucibles and jars, porcelain and glass
vessels, of all odd sorts and shapes, confronted them on tables and
shelves, and seated before small furnaces, with gauze protectors
for their faces and metal ones for their knees, and queer little
rubber gloves for their hands, were the very queerest of all the
elves Leo had yet seen. They were thinner and much less muscular
than the miners and stone-polishers, with eyes too large and legs
too small <!-- Page 38 --><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>for
their bodies, so that they resembled nothing so much as
spiders.</p>
<p>&quot;See how in the pursuit of the beautiful one can lose all
beauty,&quot; said Knops, confidentially.</p>
<p>&quot;How hot it is here!&quot; said Leo, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my dear fellow, there's no doubt of that; the heat is
tremendous. Now some of your thermometers go no higher than one
hundred and thirty, while ours can ascend to three and four
hundred; that is, for the common air of our dwellings. Of course
the heat demanded by many of our experiments is practically
incalculable; for instance&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, get me out of this!&quot; entreated Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, step into this niche, put your mouth to this
opening&quot;&mdash;and Knops pointed to one of many silver tubes which
projected near them&mdash;&quot;Now breathe. Is not that
refreshing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Leo, reviving, as he took a long draught of fresh
cool air. &quot;How do your people endure such heat?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are used to it; besides, they can come to these little
tubes, as you have done, whenever they please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where does this air come from?&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 39 --><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>&quot;It is pure
oxygen; we manufacture it, and here is a lump of pure carbon which
we also manufacture,&quot; and he laid in Leo's hand what looked like a
drop of dew. It was a diamond of exquisite lustre.</p>
<p>As Leo looked with surprise and admiration at it, an elf came
staggering up to the niche. After breathing the oxygen he turned to
Knops with a heart-rending cry.</p>
<p>&quot;I have lost it&mdash;lost it, Master Knops.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lost what, Paz?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The finest stone I ever made, and I have been years at it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did that happen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Burned it too long&mdash;look!&quot; and he produced in his spidery
hand a small mass of charcoal.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind, Paz; better luck next time,&quot; said Knops,
kindly.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I am no longer fit for the profession; such a mistake is
inexcusable. I cannot hold up my head among the others. I meant
that diamond for our King's tiara or the Queen's
necklace&mdash;bah! Please, Master Professor, put me among the
miners, or take me for your valet. I care not what I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are depressed just now; wait awhile.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 40 --><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>&quot;No, I must
go. I have broken my crucible and put out my furnace. I will not
stay to be scorned.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come with me, then, and I will see what I can do for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He may be useful to us,&quot; said Knops to Leo, adding, &quot;We never
allow these diamonds to be put in the quartz beds; they are all
reserved for our own particular uses. It takes so long a time to
make them that only elves of great patience and a certain quiet
habit of mind are trained to the task. Look!&quot;</p>
<p>He pointed towards what appeared to be a glittering cobweb
hanging from a projection on the wall. It was composed of silver
wires, on which were strung numbers of small but most exquisite
gems, each of which sparkled and flashed with its imprisoned
light.</p>
<p>&quot;In the same way,&quot; he resumed, &quot;All the pearls we use are of our
own cultivation, if I may use the term. We secure the oysters and
insert small objects within the shells, generally a seed-pearl of
insignificant size, leaving it to be worked upon by the living
fish; when enough time for the incrustation has elapsed we find our
pearls grown to a remarkable size, of rarest
<!-- Page 41 --><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>beauty and
value. These processes are not unknown to man, but men are so
clumsy that they seldom succeed in perfecting them.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo by this time was quite exhausted both by what he had seen
and by what he had heard, and he begged Knops to allow him to
rest.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, certainly, my dear,&quot; said Knops. &quot;Pardon me for
wearying you. I am more scientific than hospitable. Come to our
sleeping apartment. I think I shall allow Paz to see you, for, as
he is so unhappy, it will divert him to serve you while you remain
with us, and perhaps, too, he can suggest something suitable for
your food. I ought to have thought of this before.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo had, with three or four bites, disposed of an apple, and had
already begun on a turnip, when Knops, giving Paz a peculiar sign,
the spidery little fellow reached up and snatched the turnip from
Leo's hand.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter now?&quot; asked Leo, too tired to regain it,
easily as he could have done so.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't see anybody eat such wretched stuff as that; wait till
I cook it,&quot; said Paz.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Paz, I am glad you can help me out of my difficulty,&quot;
said Knops. &quot;I really am <!-- Page 42 --><a name="Page_42"
id="Page_42"></a>puzzled what to do for Prince Leo's hunger. My
breakfast is a wren's egg; for dinner, a sardine with a slice of
mushroom is enough for four of us; for supper, a pickled mouse
tongue. How long could you live on such fare, Leo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not long, I fear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I supposed. Well, here is the dormitory; by pushing up a
dozen or more beds, you can stretch out awhile. Meanwhile I can
attend to some professional duties, after I have despatched Paz for
your food. What are you going to do with that turnip, Paz?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An elf who can make diamonds from charcoal can perhaps produce
beefsteak from a turnip,&quot; said Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! don't remind me of my bitter humiliation, kind sir,&quot; said
Paz, in a sad tone. &quot;I will do what I can for you. Do you like
soup?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Immensely.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And roast quail?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Delicious!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Apple tart?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Adieu, then, for an hour.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 43 --><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>Knops too
departed, leaving Leo to look about him, with curious eyes, upon
rows of little beds, each with a scarlet blanket, and each having
its pitcher and basin conveniently at hand. But he soon was fast
asleep.</p>
<p>While all this was happening to Leo, at the monastery there was
great confusion. The servants had gone in a body to Prince
Morpheus's bedroom to demand their wages. With tearful eyes and
wailing voice he had protested that he had no money, that his life
was hanging by a thread, and that his brain was on fire. They
loudly urged their claims, declaring they would instantly leave the
premises unless they were paid. As they could not get a
satisfactory reply from their master, who hid his eyes at the sight
of their angry faces, and put his fingers in his ears to keep out
their noisy voices, they concluded to go; so, packing their boxes
and bags, and pressing the mules and oxen into their service, they
one by one went off to the nearest village.</p>
<p>One old woman, who had never known any other home, alone
remained, and when the storm <!-- Page 44 --><a name="Page_44"
id="Page_44"></a>subsided and the house was quiet, Morpheus, being
hungry, crawled down to the kitchen fire to find her boiling
porridge.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is my son?&quot; asked Morpheus.</p>
<p>The old woman was deaf, and only muttered, &quot;Gone&mdash;all
gone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas! and has my son also deserted his father?&quot; cried
Morpheus.</p>
<p>The old woman nodded, partly with the palsy, and partly because
she knew of nothing to say. Morpheus smote his forehead with a
tragic gesture, and allowed himself to fall&mdash;gently&mdash;upon
the floor. When he had remained in an apparent swoon long enough he
was revived by some hot porridge being poured down his throat, and
his hair and hands sprinkled with vinegar. Rousing himself as if
with great effort, but really with great ease, he stood up, and
finding the kitchen warmer than his cell, concluded to remain
there; but the old woman was too stiff with rheumatism to wait upon
him, so he had to ladle out his own portion of porridge, get his
books and candle for himself, and finally bring in some fagots for
the fire.</p>
<p>When he sat down to study he found himself in a more cheerful
mood than he had been in <!-- Page 45 --><a name="Page_45"
id="Page_45"></a>for many a day, though he could not help wondering
what had become of Leo. As he went on thinking where the boy could
be he was inspired to write what he called a sonnet upon the
subject. Here it is:</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;My boy has fled his father's
home,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No more he treads these
halls;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In vain my voice invokes his
name,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In vain my tears, my
calls.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The night winds sigh, the owlets
cry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The moon's pale light
appears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The stars are shivering in the
sky&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I tremble at my
fears.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Has then the Knight of Shadowy
Dread</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My Leo forced away</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From his fond parent's loving
heart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In Death's grim halls
astray?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I bow reluctant to my
fate;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis mine to weep and mine to
wait!&quot;</span></p>
<p>He counted the lines over carefully; the eighth and tenth seemed
short, but it scanned after a fashion. On the whole it suited him,
and was rather better done than many of his verses, so with soothed
nerves he sought his pillow.</p>
<p>The old woman had slumbered all the evening in her chair. Indeed
her snoring had been <!-- Page 46 --><a name="Page_46"
id="Page_46"></a>even and regular enough to act as a measure in
marking the time for the musical cadences of the sonnet.</p>
<p>Morpheus, having a pretty good appetite, ate some bread and
cheese and drank some ale before retiring.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER V</h4>
<p>Leo was awakened by being rudely jostled about and tumbled upon
the floor. When he opened his eyes the cause was apparent. The
elves had found their beds in disorder, and not being able to see
him, had, in their efforts to restore order, pitched him out.
Hardly had Leo reached the floor when in came Paz to the
rescue.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon, sir, for being so long absent,&quot; he said,
&quot;but the hunters had not come in with any game, and the cooks had
use for all the skillets, so that I was obliged to go to the
laboratory for a vessel large enough to hold your turnip. Soup is
made in great quantities for our work-people, and by adding a few
sauces I hope I have made it so that it will
<!-- Page 47 --><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>please you. If
you come with me now I think you may relish your meal.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo followed Paz to a small cavern hung with a velvety gray
moss, on which were clusters of red berries. A small electric light
burned in a globe of crystal, set in bands of turquoise, and shone
upon a table which, like the bed he had used, was composed of
several small ones, covered with a cloth of crimson plush, over
which was again spread a white fabric of the thinnest texture and
edged with lace. On this was laid a dinner service, so small that
it was evidently more for ornament than use. Plates of crystal were
bordered with gems, and jars and cups of embossed metal glittered
with precious stones. He was obliged, however, to eat his soup from
the tureen, and the turnip, now cooked in a sort of
<i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i>, was presented on a silver platter. Slices
of smoked rabbit, with salted steaks of prairie-dog, were offered
in place of the quail, which had not come; but Leo, having a
fondness for sweets, saw with wonder one tart made from about a
quarter of an apple. This proved to be such a sweet morsel that he
kept Paz running for more until he had eaten a dozen. No wine was
offered, but ices which <!-- Page 48 --><a name="Page_48"
id="Page_48"></a>looked like heaps of snow with the sun shining on
them were dissolving in glass vases, and water as pure as the dew
filled his goblet. Rising refreshed from his meal Leo met Knops
coming towards him. He had exchanged his dress for what looked like
a bathing suit of India rubber.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you rested?&quot; he inquired, kindly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, very much, and I must thank you and Paz for so good a
dinner,&quot; responded Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't mention it. If I had not acted on the spur of the moment,
when the impulse to amuse you seized me, I would have been better
prepared. We use many things for food which you would disdain, but
I might have secured antelope meat or Rocky Mountain mutton, and by
way of rarity something from Russia or China. Have you ever tasted
birds' nests.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;but I suppose you know why they are thought so great a
delicacy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is merely the gluten with which they are fastened together,
so to speak, by the birds, which renders them agreeable. The
Chinese <!-- Page 49 --><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>like
rats, and in this we agree with them. Well dressed, stuffed with
chestnuts or olives, and roasted, they are delicious.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo made a wry face.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! you are not cosmopolitan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A citizen of the world, a person free from national prejudices.
Ah, these words are long for you; I will try to be simple: you have
not learned to eat everything that is good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But rats are not good; they are vermin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bah! yes, because you let them feed like your hogs on anything.
We do better; we pen them, and give them grain until they are fat
and sweet, and make them eatable.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo could not disguise his dislike, so Knops, shrugging his
shoulders, did not attempt any longer to convince him, but
said,</p>
<p>&quot;Are you interested in what I have shown you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly I am,&quot; said Leo, with more spirit than he had ever
put into words.</p>
<p>&quot;And you care to go on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Prepare then for great exertion. As you are so large it will be
necessary for you to creep <!-- Page 50 --><a name="Page_50"
id="Page_50"></a>through many passages. I am going to take you to
see our water-work. The visit may be tiresome, but I think you will
be repaid. It is generally supposed that giants have greater power
than we. It may be that it is true, but I think it is doubtful. But
you may wonder why I speak now of giants. It is because they have
originated the opinion among men that the great water-falls and
cataracts, such as those of the Nile and Niagara, are entirely of
their producing, but we all know the familiar adage, 'Great oaks
from little acorns grow.' I am going to show you where the little
springs and rivulets have their rise.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo's attention had flagged during this speech&mdash;he was so
unaccustomed to many words&mdash;now his interest revived.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you remember a certain shady spot about half a mile from the
monastery, beneath a group of birch-trees, and overhung with
alders?&quot; asked Knops.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I not, indeed?&quot; responded Leo, eagerly. &quot;It is the sweetest,
coolest water on the estate. The moss around that spring is just
like green velvet. Many a time I have plunged my whole
<!-- Page 51 --><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>head in it. The
birds know it too, and always come there to drink. I sometimes find
four or five of them dipping in at once; it is a pretty sight to
see them bathe; they throw the water up under their wings until
they drip, and then they are hardly satisfied.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Knops, &quot;We have the supplying of that spring.&quot;</p>
<p>All the time they had been talking, Knops had been leading the
way through long passages and down steep steps, of which Leo's long
legs had to compass several at a stride.</p>
<p>Now they came to a low tunnel through which Leo had to creep for
what seemed to him miles. Strange to say, the weariness which so
often compelled him to rest or doze seemed to be leaving him. He
felt an altogether new impulse, a desire to explore these recesses,
and a great respect for Knops's learning also made him desirous of
conversation, which was something he had always avoided by
answering questions in the shortest possible way.</p>
<p>The tunnel was not only long and low, but it was dripping with
moisture, and the air oppressive with what seemed to be steam. Leo
<!-- Page 52 --><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>heard wheezing
and groaning sounds, which, though not frightful, were very
peculiar, and then the thump-thump, as of engines.</p>
<p>Very glad was he when the tunnel opened into another large
cavern, at the bottom of which was a lake. He could not have seen
this had it not been for the electric fluid which blazed like
daylight from a great globe overhead. On the margin of the lake
were all kinds of hydraulic machines, small as toys, but of every
conceivable form; derricks and wheels and screws and pumps, and all
under the management of busy little elves, who panted and puffed
and tugged at ropes and wheels and pipes as they worked, and kept
up a constant chant not unlike the song of the wind on a stormy
night.</p>
<p>Leo watched them intently. Once in a while one restless little
sprite would turn a hose upon his companions, when the chant would
stop long enough for the rest to dip him head and heels into the
lake, which had a very quieting effect. Leo noticed great numbers
of pipes running up the sides of the cavern in all directions, but
Knops soon opened the door of what he called &quot;The model-room,&quot; and
here were new wonders displayed.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4><!-- Page 53 --><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>CHAPTER
VI</h4>
<p>The model-room of the elves' water-work department was a grotto
of salt&mdash;glittering, dazzling, sparkling, and
flashing&mdash;divided into two equal parts, or as if a huge shelf
had been placed across it.</p>
<p>On the top of the shelf was a tiny park or forest, with all the
natural differences of the ground exactly represented by grasses,
plants, flowers, rocks, and trees, living and growing, but on a
scale so small that Leo was forced to use a microscope to properly
enjoy its beauty. Even the herbage was minute, and the trees no
larger than small ferns, but as his eyes grew accustomed to the
glass he was amazed to find the hills and dales of his home here
reproduced in the most familiar manner.</p>
<p>It was truly an exquisite scene. Field upon field dotted with
daisies, woodland as dense and wild as untrained nature leaves it,
and hill upon hill clambering over one another, all so minute and
yet so real, and dashing down from the tiny mountains was a stream
of foaming water, winding about and gathering in from all sides
other <!-- Page 54 --><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>tributary
brooks, so small that they would hardly have floated a good-sized
leaf.</p>
<p>And now Leo understood the meaning of it all, as he looked
underneath the shelf where tiny pumps and rams were forcing up the
water for this stream.</p>
<p>Knops touched a spring and set a new series of wheels in motion,
when, instantly, a gushing fountain flowed up in a small stone
basin beneath a rustic cross; then a little lake appeared, on which
were sailing small swans; and finally a rushing, roaring flood
started some mill-wheels and almost threatened destruction to the
tiny buildings upon its banks.</p>
<p>&quot;This,&quot; said Knops, &quot;shows you how we use the power of our
reservoirs, but it can give you no idea of the immense trouble we
have in laying pipes for great distances. Some of our elves find it
so difficult that they beg for other work, and many run off
altogether and live above-ground, inhabiting the regions of springs
and brooks, and so muddying them and filling them up with weeds
that men let them alone, which is just what they desire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do fish ever clog your pipes?&quot; asked Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;Never. We have none in our lakes; the
<!-- Page 55 --><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>water is too
pure and free from vegetable matter for fish. It is doubly
distilled. Taste it.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo took the glass which Knops offered, and confessed he had
never tasted anything more delicious.</p>
<p>&quot;We sometimes force carbonic gas into mineral springs, but that,
as well as the salts considered so beneficial, is left to our
chemists to regulate. Paz, do you know anything about this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not much, Master Knops. I have seen iron in various forms
introduced, but think that is usually controlled by the earth's
formation.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo sighed at his own ignorance, and vowed to study up these
matters; but Knops, seeing his look of dejection, asked, &quot;How would
you like a bath?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Delightful. Where? Surely not in the lake; it looks so cold and
glassy I should not dare.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no, no,&quot; laughed Knops. &quot;Do you think I'd let you bathe in
a reservoir? Never! We are too cleanly for that, begging your
pardon. Here is our general bath. It's quite a tub, isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 56 --><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>&quot;I should
think so,&quot; said Leo, surveying quite a spacious apartment, about
which were pipes and faucets, clothes-lines and screens.</p>
<p>Here his friend left him, and he was glad to doff his garments
for a plunge. He found that he could make the water hot or cold at
will, and so luxurious was it that he would have stayed in any
length of time had not a crowd of elves come chattering in, and
with whoop and scream surrounded him. Though they could not see
him, they were conscious of some disturbing force in the water, and
in an instant a lot of them had scrambled on his back, and were
making a boat of him. They pulled his hair and his ears
unmercifully, and because he swam slowly, with their weight upon
him, they whacked and thumped him like little pirates. But he had
his revenge, for with one turn he tumbled them all off, and sprang
from the bath, leaving them to squirm and squabble by
themselves.</p>
<p>Laughing heartily at their antics, he rejoined Knops and Paz,
whom he found poring over some maps spread out before them.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been discussing the length of a journey to the Geysers
of Iceland, also to the hot springs of the Yellowstone, but I am
afraid <!-- Page 57 --><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>either
would require too much time. Was your bath agreeable?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very,&quot; said Leo, describing how he had been pummelled.</p>
<p>&quot;Those were the fellows from the steam-rooms&mdash;stokers
probably. Rough enough they are. Do you care to have a glance at
them at work?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't care if I do,&quot; said Leo, in his old drawling manner;
then, correcting himself, he added: &quot;If it suits your convenience,
I shall be very happy to take a look.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is all it will be, I promise you,&quot; said Paz; &quot;The heat is
awful.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo thought as much when Knops, having tied a respirator over
his mouth, opened another door. Such a cloud of vapor puffed out
that he could but dimly discern what seemed to be a tank of
boiling, bubbling water, resting on a bed of soft coal, about which
stark little forms were dancing and poking with long steel bars
until flames leaped out like tongues of fire.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Leo, as he quickly turned from his place, &quot;how do
they endure it? It is dreadful!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are used to it; they all came from
<!-- Page 58 --><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>Terra del
Fuego,&quot; replied Knops, calmly. &quot;And now, as a contrast to them,
look in here.&quot;</p>
<p>A hut of solid ice presented itself. Long pendants of ice hung
from the ceiling, snow in masses was being formed into shapes of
statue-like grace by a company of little furry objects whose noses
were not even visible, and others were tracing out, on a broad
screen of lace-like texture, patterns of every star and leaf and
flower imaginable.</p>
<p>Leo was so delighted that, although shivering, he could not bear
to leave them, but begged Knops to lend him a wrap.</p>
<p>Taking from a pile of furs in a corner several small garments,
Paz pinned them together and threw them over Leo's shoulders, and
as he continued to watch the beautiful work Knops explained its
character.</p>
<p>&quot;This is our place for working out designs for those who are
unskilled in frost-work. Frostwork is something too delicate for
human hands, but in it we excel. Have you never seen on your
window-pane of a cold winter morning the picture of a forest of
pines, or sheets of sparkling stars and crystals? I am sure you
have. Well, we do all that work on your windows, not
<!-- Page 59 --><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>with artificial
snow and ice such as you see here, but by dexterous management we
catch the falling flakes and mould them to our will, sometimes
doing nothing more than spangling a sheet of glass, and again
working out the most elaborate and fantastic marvels of embroidery.
But in art our productions are almost endless. We color the tiniest
blades of grass and beds of strawberry leaves until the moss upon
which they rest look like velvet with floss needlework. We polish
the chestnuts till they appear as if carved of rosewood. We strip
thistles of their prickly coat, and use the down for pillows. The
milk-weed, as it ripens its silken-winged seeds, serves us for many
beautiful purposes. We tint the pebbles of a brook till they
compare with Florentine mosaics. We wreathe and festoon every bare
old bowlder and every niche made barren by the winds. Indeed, the
list of our works would fill a volume.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo listened and looked, though his feet were getting numb and
his fingers nearly frozen. Many a time he had seen just such
cappings to gate-posts and projections as were here being moulded,
and just such rows of pearly drops on a gable's edge; but when, as
if to specially please <!-- Page 60 --><a name="Page_60"
id="Page_60"></a>him, the busy workers carved a little snow maid
winding a scarf about her curly locks, he clapped his hands in
admiration, making such a noise that each little Esquimau dropped
his tool in alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;Gently! gently!&quot; said Paz and Knops; &quot;They are easily
frightened. Though they do not see you, their instinct is so fine
that they can nearly guess your presence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry if I have frightened them,&quot; said Leo. &quot;Can't you say
something to soothe them? Tell them how lovely their things are. I
long to try and imitate them.&quot;</p>
<p>Knops said a few words in a language Leo did not comprehend, and
the little people gathered up their trowels again. But it was time
to go, and Leo had to follow his guides and leave the snow people
with more reluctance than anything he had yet seen.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VII</h4>
<p>Knops now led Leo through so many places full of machines and
contrivances which the water-power kept active that he was
<!-- Page 61 --><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>glad when they
went up a long inclined plane, and came out into a wide gallery
lined with mother-of-pearl, and paved with exquisite
sea-shells.</p>
<p>Here was a luxurious couch of beautiful feathers, the plumage of
birds he had never beheld, and he was not sorry to see Paz bringing
out another dozen of tarts for his refreshment. As he ate them, he
asked of Knops, who was peeling a lime, &quot;Have you no women and
children among your elves?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Knops, smiling; &quot;but they are not to be found
near our workshops.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where, then, do they live?&quot;</p>
<p>Knops put on an air of mystery as he replied: &quot;I am not
permitted to reveal everything concerning us, dear Leo. Our private
life is of no public interest; but I may tell you that our children
are bred entirely in the open air. Many an empty bird's nest is
used as an elf cradle, for so highly do we esteem pure air,
sunshine, and exposure as a means of making our children hardy,
that we even accustom them to danger, and let them, like the birds,
face the fury of the weather.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And do they all work as you do?&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 62 --><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>&quot;They do, not
at the same employments, nor is all our labor done by hand, as you
might suppose. The songs which you hear are not all sung by birds
or insects, the crying child has often a pretty tale whispered in
his ear to soothe his grief or passion, and your garden roses are
witness to many a worm in the bud choked by the hand of an elf. But
we have many tribes, and the habits of each are different. I do not
conceal that much trouble is made by some of them. But look at the
Indians of North America and the Afghans of Asia.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo was yawning again fearfully, when a little &quot;Turn, turn,
turn,&quot; came to his ears, and as Knops ceased speaking a band of
elves, habited as troubadours in blue and silver, with long white
plumes in their velvet caps, climbed over the balustrade and began
to play on zithers.</p>
<p>The music was a gentle tinkle, not unlike a rippling brook, and
appeared to be in honor of Master Knops, who listened with pleased
attention, and dismissed them politely.</p>
<p>Then came a message for Knops. A council was awaiting his
presence; so, leaving Leo to Paz, with promise of a speedy return,
he departed.</p>
<p><!-- Page 63 --><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>&quot;How do you
get about so fast?&quot; asked Leo. Paz took from his pocket a tiny
pipe, curiously carved from a nut; then he opened a small ivory
box, showing Leo a wad of something which looked like raw cotton
sprinkled with black seeds.</p>
<p>&quot;One whiff of this, as it burns in my pipe, and I can wish
myself where I please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me have a try,&quot; said Leo, taking up the pipe.</p>
<p>Paz smiled. &quot;It would have no more effect upon you than so much
tobacco&mdash;not as much, probably, for tobacco makes you deathly
sick, does it not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Leo, listlessly, disappointed that he could not go
to the ends of the earth by magic.</p>
<p>Paz noticed the disappointment, and said, by way of diversion,
&quot;Where do you like best to be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At home I like the kitchen,&quot; said Leo, with a little shrug.</p>
<p>&quot;Good! Come, then, to one of ours: we can be back by the time
Master Knops returns.&quot; So saying, he started off, and Leo
followed.</p>
<p>Paz trotted down a winding staircase that
<!-- Page 64 --><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>made Leo feel as
if he were a corkscrew, and in a little while ushered him into a
place where jets of gas gave a garden-like effect, sprouting as
they did from solid rock in the form of tulips and tiger-lilies,
but over each was a wire netting, and from the netting were
suspended shining little copper kettles and pans of all sorts and
shapes.</p>
<p>Busily bending over these was a regiment of cooks, but instead
of paper caps on their heads, each wore a white bonnet of ludicrous
form, which they could tip over so as to shield their faces from
the heat. It gave them a top-heavy appearance which was extremely
funny.</p>
<p>In the centre of the kitchen was a long table, before which were
seated a number of elves testing each compound to see if it were
properly prepared, and examining the cooked dishes as they were
brought in that all should be served rightly.</p>
<p>&quot;I had an idea,&quot; said Leo, &quot;that elves and fairies lived on rose
leaves and honey, and that you never had to have things
cooked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The truth is,&quot; answered Paz, &quot;we do both; it all depends on
what are our employments, whether we are living in the wild wood or
down <!-- Page 65 --><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>in these
caverns. I would ask nothing better than to dine off honeysuckle
and a bird's egg, or fill my pockets with gooseberries; but I must
adapt myself to circumstances, and while toiling here have to share
the more solid food provided for us.&quot; As he said this he handed Leo
a pudding of about three inches in the round, iced on the top.</p>
<p>Leo swallowed it down with such zest that Paz asked him to
dispense with ceremony, and help himself to anything he saw. The
tasting-table was full of puffs and tarts, and in a twinkling Leo
had eaten two or three dozen of them. They were really so light and
frothy that they were hardly equal to an ounce of lollypops such as
an ordinary child could devour, but Paz cautioned him, telling him
that the sweet was so concentrated he might have a headache.</p>
<p>While he was doing this, Leo watched with interest the bringing
in of some squirrels and rabbits, skinned and ready to be roasted.
It took six elves to bear the weight of an ordinary meat dish on
which these were; then they trussed and skewered them, and put them
in small ovens.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you kill your game?&quot; asked Leo.</p>
<p><!-- Page 66 --><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>&quot;We trap
everything, and then have a mode of killing the creatures which is
entirely painless.&quot;</p>
<p>By this time Knops would have returned, so Paz hurried Leo off,
not, however, without first filling his pockets with goodies. Up
they clambered, until it seemed as if they might reach the stars by
going a little farther, and now Leo was really so tired that when
he sank down on the feathery couch in the sea-shell corridor he was
asleep before he could explain to Knops the cause of his
absence.</p>
<p>He must have slept a very long while&mdash;a time quite equal to
an ordinary night, if not longer&mdash;for when he awoke he was
thoroughly rested and refreshed, and ready for any exertion he
might be called upon to make; but he found himself entirely
alone.</p>
<p>At first this did not affect him, for he supposed his elfin
friends had taken the opportunity to rest themselves, but after
minutes lengthened into hours he began to be uneasy. What should he
do if they never came back? How would he ever find his way out of
these caverns? The thought was frightful, and to relieve his fears
he began to call. His calls became shouts,
<!-- Page 67 --><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>yells, and yet
no answer came; nothing but echoes responded.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VIII</h4>
<p>After a long and impatient listening the echoes of Leo's calls
seemed to prolong themselves into musical strains, which, faint and
far away at first, gradually came nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>Soft as the sighing of the wind was this elfin music, but
swelling into mimic bursts of harmony and clashing of small
cymbals.</p>
<p>Leo leaned over the balustrade of the corridor, and gazed down
into the depths of a cavernous abyss. Instantly the space seemed
filled with sprites in every conceivable attire. Some were dressed
in the party-colored habits of court pages, some in royal robes of
ermine, others as shepherds with crooks, and again others as
cherubs with gauzy wings; but all were whirling like snow-flakes to
the strains of the music.</p>
<p>Leo looked in vain for Paz or Knops. Indeed, so many were the
fantastic forms, and so rapidly did they move, that it was like
watching <!-- Page 68 --><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>a
snow-storm, and this effect was heightened by misty wreaths, upon
which were borne aloft the more radiant members, who danced and
flashed as heat-lightning on the clouds of a summer's night. The
light, instead of being a bright glare, was soft and mellow, and
fell from crescent-shaped lanterns on the staffs of pages, who
moved in a measured way among the throng, producing a kaleidoscopic
effect.</p>
<p>Leo watched them with eager eyes. Beautiful as the sight was, he
yet was oppressed with fear, for he knew not how to reveal himself
to these sportive beings, and he could not imagine how he should
ever be released from his imprisonment.</p>
<p>Suddenly the dancers fled as if pursued, the music became
martial, and the steady tramp of a host of elves was heard. They
were clad in mail, with helmets and shields of flashing steel, and
armed with glittering lances; half of them had blue plumes and half
had crimson. And now began their mimic warfare. Ranged line upon
line, facing each other, with shouts and drum beats and bugle
blasts, they fell upon each other in the fury of combat. Swords
clashed, javelins were hurled, and the slain fell in heaps;
<!-- Page 69 --><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>but still the
leaders charged, and still the martial blasts were heard; and over
and over were repeated the manoeuvres of the advance, the retreat,
the parrying of blows, the redoubled ardor of assault, until Leo's
breath came short and hard with the excitement of the scene. It
seemed a veritable battle-field, and to add to the glamour rays as
of moonbeams, shone now and again clouded by the shadows of an
approaching storm.</p>
<p>Gradually the rage of the combatants subsided. Those who were
able withdrew with those of their companions who were disabled,
leaving the prostrate forms of the dead and dying.</p>
<p>And now the music portrayed the rising of the wind, the falling
of rain, the roar of thunder. This was succeeded by low, plaintive
strains, as of people weeping, and a party of elves in the garb of
monks headed a procession bearing lighted tapers and carrying
biers, upon which they placed the inanimate forms of the warriors.
Slowly they paced about, chanting in low tones, and constantly
accompanied by the funeral dirge of the musicians.</p>
<p>And now to Leo's almost overtaxed vision
<!-- Page 70 --><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>came a picture
of a lonely graveyard in the mountains, where the procession
stopped. Even as he looked it faded away; the sun streamed forth,
shining upon a field of grain where merry reapers swung their
scythes and sang with glee. Trees sprouted from fissures in the
rock, birds flew about and perched undismayed, and little
hay-carts, piled high with their loads, came creaking along, led by
peasant elves, who were also seated on top of their fragrant heaps
of hay. Then the sun beamed upon a party of drovers&mdash;elves in
smock-frocks or blouses, driving flocks of sheep and horned cattle,
while the bleating of the sheep and the blowing of the cattle were
well imitated by the music. All this was succeeded by vineyards,
grape trellises, and arbors, with busy elves gathering the fruit
which hung in purple clusters, and beneath the arbors other elves
rattling castanets, beating tambourines, and dancing.</p>
<p>Again the scene changed. Snow fell; the birds disappeared; the
tree boughs were glittering with ice, and were bending over a wide
field of the same glassy substance. On it were elves in bright
costumes, merrily skating. They glided about, cutting curious
figures, pausing to <!-- Page 71 --><a name="Page_71"
id="Page_71"></a>bend and bow to each other, or to warm themselves
at bonfires blazing on the banks.</p>
<p>Then night came again, and the darkness was only broken by
twinkling stars. The music became softer and more plaintive; it
sounded like little flutes.</p>
<p>A church tower loomed up, and then a blaze of light issued from
its arched doors. Two by two, in white array, came forth the elves,
and from the floating veils Leo saw that it was meant to represent
a bridal procession. Garlands were on their arms, and ribbons
fluttered from their caps. Roses were strewn in their path.</p>
<p>Again, these were followed by a company of elves in the habit of
nuns and Sisters of Charity. The music became a hymn. The church
grew dark and vanished. The space filled again with shadowy forms,
as if all the little actors had poured in. The sound of their
coming was like that of a bevy of birds with wings fluttering.
Suddenly a starry cross appeared; it flashed and flamed with a
light which was as if it were composed of myriads of gems, and then
a clear radiance streamed from it, revealing the whole multitude of
elves kneeling in devotion. This <!-- Page 72 --><a name="Page_72"
id="Page_72"></a>lasted but a few moments, and again all was still
and dark, and Leo was alone.</p>
<p>But he was no longer afraid. His mind was filled with the
beautiful scenes he had witnessed, his imagination stirred to
activity. Why might he not behold these things again as a reality,
instead of only a semblance of it? How grand it would be to travel
and see novel and beautiful sights, to learn also wonderful things!
And as he quietly thought, he heard the click, click of little
boots, and Knops was beside him, followed by Paz. Leo greeted them
warmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you suppose that we had deserted you?&quot; asked Knops, sitting
down by his side on the couch as if exhausted.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I was a little alarmed; it was so strange to find myself
alone in such a place, for of course I had no idea which way to
turn or what to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were so soundly asleep that I had not the cruelty to
disturb you, and it was necessary for Paz to go with me. From what
you have witnessed you may guess how we have been employed and how
much we have had to detain us; but you may rest assured that
nothing would keep me from finishing what I have undertaken. You
have now had a Vision of Life and a
<!-- Page 73 --><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>Vision of Labor,
for such I call our two pantomimes. Am I wrong in supposing that
they have pleased you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; said Leo, quickly, his usual drawl giving place to
a tone of bright animation. &quot;I thank you a thousand times for your
entertainment and instruction. I have been so pleased and delighted
that I can hardly express myself as I ought to do. I am afraid I
seem a very good-for-nothing fellow to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed you do not. Don't suppose I would waste time on a
good-for-naught. Paz can tell you what attracted me to
you&mdash;can't you, Paz?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir; the Prince Leo's kindness of heart is the secret of
his power with us.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo blushed as he looked up and asked, &quot;How did you know I was
soft-hearted?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By your kindness to animals and all living things. Ah! we are
close observers, are we not, Paz?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Necessarily, Master Professor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our powers of observation have revealed to us many of the
mysteries which man longs to solve. There's the Gulf Stream, for
instance. But you are not up in science yet. No matter. You have
time enough before you if you will
<!-- Page 74 --><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>only apply
yourself. Has anything you have seen made you anxious to know
more?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don't mention it!&quot; exclaimed Leo. &quot;I am so awfully ashamed
of my ignorance that I would do anything to get rid of it. I want
to know all about those curious things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good! the seed is sown, Paz,&quot; said Knops, complacently, with
the nearest approach to a wink Leo had seen on his grave little
countenance. &quot;Now you must rest again before we start for
home.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo would have been very willing to do without more rest,
remembering his alarm, but he could not be so selfish as to deprive
his companion of it; so he at once assented, tempted to ask only
that he might not be left quite so long again alone. But fearing
this would imply distrust, and being really no coward, he said
nothing. He was relieved, however, to hear Knops command Paz to
remain with him.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IX</h4>
<p>Leo tried to go to sleep; but after doing everything he could
think of, such as imagining a flock of sheep jumping a fence, and
<!-- Page 75 --><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>counting a
hundred backward and forward, he gave it up as useless. All the
strange things he had seen would come back, and his eyelids were
like little spring doors that bobbed open in spite of his attempts
to close them. As they lifted for the hundredth time he saw Paz
doubled up in a heap, with his knees drawn up to his chin, his
elbows resting on them, and his face in his hands. He was intently
watching Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;Hallo!&quot; said Leo, &quot;can't you go to sleep either?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No need at present.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was going through a formula in D.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What under the sun is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something relating to my pursuits. Don't trouble yourself to
try and find out everything. In my opinion Master Knops has crammed
you too hard. What do you say to my telling you a story or
two?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Splendid! I'm ready when you are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, you are not; you're hungry. You must have a bite first;
what shall it be? Oh, no matter; I'll get you something if you
promise not to ask any questions.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 76 --><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>&quot;All right,&quot;
said Leo, inwardly cringing at the thought of stuffed rats.</p>
<p>Paz was gone but a little while. When he came back he was
carrying a basket, from which he produced a small flask of a very
sweet, fruity sirup, a dish of something that looked like little
fish swimming in golden jelly&mdash;salt and savory Leo found
them&mdash;and a sort of salad garnished with tiny eggs. These were
followed by nuts of a peculiar flavor, and small fruits as
exquisite to look at as they were delicious to taste.</p>
<p>When Leo had done ample justice to all these things Paz looked
relieved, as if he had feared they might not suit.</p>
<p>&quot;Never ate anything better in my life,&quot; said Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;I am glad to hear it; tastes differ so. Now these things come
from all parts of the world&mdash;the fish from Spain, the eggs
from Africa, the nuts from Italy, the fruits from France, and the
sirup from Portugal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh dear!&quot; said Leo, wondering how their freshness was
preserved.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I suppose you have no idea of our canning business.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;None in the world.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 77 --><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>&quot;I presumed
as much,&quot; said Paz, wisely, &quot;Nor am I going to bore you with any
more information.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo looked quite shocked.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, well,&quot; said Paz, profoundly, &quot;There's a limit to all
things, and I'm not a Knops.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But have you been to all parts of the world?&quot; asked Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; answered Paz, carelessly. &quot;I have wandered far and
wide in my time. Until I caught the diamond fever I was used as an
envoy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; said Leo, having but a faint idea of what an envoy
was. &quot;What did you do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I went on errands of importance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who for, and where did you go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was sent generally to carry messages from our King to the
Queen of the Wind Fairies or the Herb Elves, or the Sylphs,
sometimes to warn them of trouble or danger, sometimes to tell them
that imps were rampaging or giants were about to make war, but
oftener to inform them of some plan for assisting man, or some good
to be done for a child: in these things we delight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How kind!&quot; said Leo.</p>
<p><!-- Page 78 --><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>&quot;Kindness has
so much power, if people only knew it. But you are waiting; I must
not detain you.&quot; So, without further preface, thus began</p>
<p>PAZ'S STORY</p>
<p>&quot;It was a time of trouble to mankind&mdash;a year of strange
events, and yet so stupid are ordinary mortals&mdash;begging your
pardon&mdash;that none were making preparations either to meet or
to avoid disaster. The King of the Kobolds had been negotiating
with our King for the purchase of some immense tracts of iron ore,
and in the course of conversation said he had received news from
Italy that there would soon be a volcanic outbreak, that the giants
there were quarrelling fiercely, and had not hesitated to declare
that unless matters were arranged to suit them they would bid
Vesuvius pour forth its death-dealing fires.</p>
<p>&quot;Now on the side of that well-known mountain were living some
friends of our King&mdash;two children, a girl and a boy, Tessa and
Tasso, daughter and son of an Italian peasant.</p>
<p>&quot;In their little vineyard one day our King's son, an infant, was
swinging in his leafy cradle; <!-- Page 79 --><a name="Page_79"
id="Page_79"></a>it looked like a bird's nest, and so I suppose
they thought it, but a rude playmate of theirs tried to tear it
down from its airy height, and would have succeeded had not both
Tessa and Tasso resolutely opposed him.</p>
<p>&quot;First they sought to make him stop by appealing to his
feelings, asking him how he would like to have his cottage ruined,
his home desolated; but at this he only mocked and jeered. Then
they urged that birds had the same right to live and rear their
young as had human beings; which having no more effect, they openly
forbade his attempt, saying that the ground was theirs, the birds
were their friends, and they should defend them. Blows followed,
Tessa and Tasso bearing their part bravely, and compelling the
young ruffian to take himself off. Little did they know whom they
were defending.</p>
<p>&quot;Our King heard of the occurrence, and vowed unending
friendship; so when the King of the Kobolds told him of the danger
impending at Vesuvius I was at once sent for to convey the
information, and do what I could to save the lives of Tessa and
Tasso. It took but a whiff of my pipe to bring me to the desired
<!-- Page 80 --><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>place, but so
calm and bright and peaceful was the scene that I found it hard to
believe in the threatening evil. Never had I seen a bluer sky
reflected in a more silvery mirror than were the clouds and bay of
Naples that day. The people were merry and careless, tending their
cattle, gathering their fruit, singing their songs, and as
indifferent to their old enemy as if he had never harmed them.</p>
<p>&quot;How should I approach the object of my mission? how put fear
into the hearts of joyous innocence? Their father had bidden them
go to the city with a load of oranges. These were to be conveyed in
large baskets, or panniers, on the back of a faithful donkey. If I
could keep them away from home, delay them by some pretext from
returning for at least a day, I might aid them. So with this
determination I proceeded to act.</p>
<p>&quot;At every place or with every person to whom they offered their
fruit I whispered objections, asked if their prices were not very
high, or if the fruit were not picked too early. So well did I
succeed that I had nearly upset my own plans, for poor Tessa,
becoming discouraged, wanted to return home at once, but Tasso
stoutly <!-- Page 81 --><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>declared
he would sell every orange before going back&mdash;that his fruit
was good and ripe, and it should be appreciated. I was pained to
see Tessa's tears, but what could I do? Already thick smoke was
pouring down the mountain's side, and so many were the rumbling
sounds that although these children were accustomed to such
disturbances, fears began to assail them.</p>
<p>&quot;They were now well away from home, and had paused at the
roadside to eat their bread-and-cheese. People were becoming
unusually numerous. Excitement was prevailing, and Tessa saw with
alarm women and children hurrying past. At that moment a travelling
carriage appeared. One could see at a glance from its neat
compactness that it was English. I put my head in the window, and
whispered something. At once a gray-haired lady leaned out, and
beckoned to Tessa, who tremblingly obeyed.</p>
<p>&quot;'My child,' said the lady, kindly, 'I want some oranges. Can
you give them to me quickly? You know we have no time to
spare.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Yes, madame,' said Tessa. 'But what is the matter? You and
every one look so anxious.'</p>
<p>&quot;Instantly, as she spoke, there was a terrible
<!-- Page 82 --><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>quivering of the
earth, which made every one shudder. The driver could scarcely hold
his horses; they plunged and reared and trembled.</p>
<p>&quot;'Ah! we cannot wait,' said the lady; but seeing the terrified
looks of the children, she paused to ask, 'Are you children
alone?'</p>
<p>&quot;'Entirely so, signorina.'</p>
<p>&quot;'And where are you going?'</p>
<p>&quot;'Home, to the mountain.'</p>
<p>&quot;'You cannot go there; it is too late.' Then with a sudden
resolution she turned to the maid beside her. 'We will take them
with us; their load is too heavy for them to get on fast enough.
Quick! quick! Leave your donkey; he is tired; every one is so
frightened he will not be stolen if he escapes. Come in here,'
pushing open the carriage door.</p>
<p>&quot;Tessa turned irresolutely to Tasso, who was also uncertain what
to do; but the tone was imperative; they were accustomed to obey.
Crowds were now jostling them; women were crying; children were
pushed hither and thither, their little toys trodden underfoot,
more a grievance to them than the quaking earth. With a regretful
glance at the donkey, Tessa and Tasso jumped into the carriage,
which drove away as <!-- Page 83 --><a name="Page_83"
id="Page_83"></a>fast as the frightened horses could get through
the throng. Miles and miles away they went until the horses could
go no farther. Then they stopped for the night at a little inn
overflowing with strangers, where they heard that Vesuvius was
pouring forth lava, and where they could see the lurid glare of its
flames reddening the evening sky. They were saved. My mission was
fulfilled.&quot;</p>
<p>Paz stopped; but Leo was unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&quot;And what became of them? Did they ever go home again? Were
their father and mother killed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; their parents escaped, but their home was buried in ashes.
The children were cared for by the English lady until it was safe
to return. All that was left them was the one poor donkey which,
unharmed, strayed back to the place of its past abode, and with it
they began a trade in lava which proved very remunerative.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Trade in lava?&quot; repeated Leo, inquisitively.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; the people pour melted lava in moulds before it cools, and
so fashion ornaments out of it&mdash;perhaps they also carve it. I
know they color it beautifully, for I have had to carry
<!-- Page 84 --><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>bracelets made
of it to various people with whom we are on friendly terms, and
they were blue as a bird's egg or turquoise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How curious!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; they were not remarkable, not half as singular as coral
formations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't tell me you know nothing of coral!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe I have seen it, but that is all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Coral is made by wonderful little animals who live and die in
its cells until their structures are big enough for islands; but I
will leave that to Knops: my plan is not to cram.&quot;</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER X</h4>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Leo, &quot;you are not going to stop, I hope.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; said Paz, cheerfully, &quot;I can spin yarns with any
sailor. What will you have now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something funny.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I could oblige you, but fun is not my strong point. I
went from Greenland to the South Seas one day in search of a laugh,
but I <!-- Page 85 --><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>failed to
find it; indeed I came near doing worse, for in getting into the
hoop of a native's nose-ring for a swing&mdash;just by way of a new
sensation&mdash;I forgot to make myself invisible, and he caught
me, thought I was a spider, and would have crushed me, had not a
baby put out its little hands in glee to play with me. I can assure
you I was for a time averse to trying new sensations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you get out of your scrape?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I travelled down that baby's back in a hurry, and hid in an
ant-hill; he poked about with his little black fingers for a
quarter of an hour, but he did not find me. Ah, those were the days
of my youth!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you ever have anything to do with witches?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mark my words, ghosts and witches live only in the imagination
of silly human beings. We useful people scorn them. Now imps might
be said to belong to the same family were it not for the proofs we
have of their existence. They are everlastingly getting children
into trouble by suggesting things to them they never would have
thought of&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Such as what?&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 86 --><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>&quot;Do you
suppose I am going to tell you? No, indeed; they can do it fast
enough for themselves. Persons who take too much wine are their
most constant companions; they pounce upon them and twitch and
tease and torment them until the poor wine-bibber trembles from
head to foot. They won't let him sleep or eat or think, and fairly
drive him crazy. Oh, imps are really to be dreaded! But I must now
begin my second story.&quot;</p>
<p>PAZ'S SECOND STORY</p>
<p>&quot;There was to be a grand birthday festival among the Fays, who
inhabit the tropics. The wind fairies had brought us news of it as
well as urgent invitations for our royal family to be present; but
so deeply engrossed was our King at that moment in supplying the
oil wells of Pennsylvania with petroleum that he could not absent
himself. The Queen never goes from home without her liege lord.</p>
<p>&quot;The princes and princesses were all too young, and could not be
allowed to leave their lessons; so the regrets were inscribed on
lotus leaves, and sent by special messenger&mdash;a bird of the
Cypselina family. He was a great sooty-black
<!-- Page 87 --><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>fellow, with a
tinge of green in his feathers, strong, well able to fly, as his
family generally do from America to Asia. But the gift could not be
intrusted to him. I was chosen as bearer of that.</p>
<p>&quot;Much discussion had taken place as to what this gift should be.
It was desirable that nothing ordinary should be offered, for the
Fays are, as a rule, fastidious. Gems they possess in abundance.
Flowers are so common that their beds are made of them. Their books
are 'the running brooks,' and their art treasures hang on every
bough. The Queen had woven a veil of lace with her own fingers; it
was filmy and exquisite, but my heart sank within me when she
declared that nothing less than a wreath of snow-flakes must
accompany it. To obtain this wreath and carry it to the Fays as a
birthday gift was to be my duty.</p>
<p>&quot;How should I accomplish it? I dared not suggest the
difficulties, for at once I should have been displaced, and another
elf chosen for the performance of this arduous task. Besides, if it
could be accomplished by any one, I must be that person, having
always been unwilling ever to allow difficulties to deter me from
any duty. <!-- Page 88 --><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>Pride
of the right sort is a great help. I went to the frost-workers and
told them what I wanted. They said they could imitate any flower;
but the Queen had expressly said that the wreath must be of
snow-flakes. Now the fantastic impulse of a snow-storm is well
known, but it is not so generally known that there is a scientific
accuracy even in the formation of snow-flakes.&quot;</p>
<p>Here Paz stopped, shook his head, smiled, and said, &quot;I do
believe I am as bad as Knops.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please go on,&quot; said Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you must forgive me, for I shall have to tell you that
the frost-workers said there were no less than a thousand different
forms among the crystals of which snow-flakes are made.</p>
<p>&quot;Now how could I tell what pattern to choose? It was impossible;
so I told them I should have nothing to do with the pattern. 'Make
the wreath,' said I, 'box it, and I will carry it, or die in the
attempt.'</p>
<p>&quot;They did so. The crystals were more beautiful than diamond
stars. They put it in a solid square of ice, which was packed in
charcoal and straw, and then cased in cocoa matting. To this I
attached cords, and slung it about my
<!-- Page 89 --><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>neck. The veil,
in a satin case half an inch square, was in my wallet.</p>
<p>&quot;I started in the track of the marten that carried the
despatches, but changed my course many times, striving to keep in
cold currents. Finding, however, that as I neared the Equator this
was impossible, I took to the sea, and went down to its highway. Of
course I had on garments impervious to water&mdash;that is to say,
water-proof&mdash;and my wallet was as dry as a bone; but not being
in the habit of travelling under ocean, my eyes were a little
affected by the salt, and I became conscious that I was being
followed.</p>
<p>&quot;Fishes, you know, are not down on the hard rocky bed of the
sea, and I had passed the homes of mermen, so I was puzzled to know
who could be my enemy. I would not so much as betray my fears by
looking behind, and I had enough to do in looking forward, for at
every other step there were fissures which had to be leaped, deep
abysses to be avoided, chasms to be crossed, and sands which might
ingulf me.</p>
<p>&quot;Still, as I struggled on, I could hear the sound of other feet
following mine, now nearing me, now farther away, as my speed
asserted <!-- Page 90 --><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>itself.
It made me shiver to think what might be my fate, and I can
honestly say that the thought of failing to fulfill my errand bore
as heavily upon me as the sense of personal dangers; for it is a
great thing to be trusted, to be looked upon as honest and true,
and deemed capable of transacting affairs even of small moment.</p>
<p>&quot;But this was not a trifling matter. The neglect to deliver this
gift could bring about serious trouble. The Fays were our friends,
and friendship is never to be slighted. It is not kind to allow
selfish matters to stand in the way when we are bidden to a joyous
celebration, and had not our King felt that the claims of man were
more urgent than those of the Fays he would have attended this
feast in person. As he could not, the gift was to represent him. I
trust I have made it clear to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so,&quot; said Leo. &quot;but I am crazy to know who was following
you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So was I at that time, and I resolved to get into the first
empty shell I could find where I might hide. There was soon an
opportunity. A heap of cast-off shells presented itself, and I
popped into an enormous crab cover, where I
<!-- Page 91 --><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>waited for my
unknown companion to overtake me.</p>
<p>&quot;As the steps came near I peeped carefully out, and what should
I see but an ugly South American river-wolf, about three and a half
feet long, with a short, close fur of a bright ruddy yellow. I
could not imagine what had brought him after me, but the ways of
the wicked are often difficult to explain. There he was, and if
once he could get me within reach I was lost. On he came, snuffing
and barking like a dog, making my very hair stand on end. I waited
for him to pass, but I think his instinct must have told him I had
paused, for he began to turn over the shells with his ugly nose, as
if searching for something. My single weapon was a small dirk, as
we kill only in self-defence.</p>
<p>&quot;Bracing myself against the wall of my slight shelter, I stood
in expectation of an assault, and I had not long to wait. With an
angry cry he rushed upon me. His size seemed to me enormous, but my
little knife was a trusty blade, and with a great effort I drew it
across his dreadful throat.</p>
<p>&quot;I will not dwell on these particulars. I had overcome my enemy.
I resumed my journey, <!-- Page 92 --><a name="Page_92"
id="Page_92"></a>and soon came to a region of the most beautiful
water-plants growing in greatest profusion. I knew by these that I
was not far from the home of the Fays.</p>
<p>&quot;I neglected to tell you that before starting out the chief
frost-worker had given me a small vial of clear liquid, which, in
case of any danger from heat, I was to use for the preservation of
the snow-wreath. In my tussle with the wolf this vial must have
become partly uncorked, for I became aware of a strong odor
diffusing itself about me, and an overpowering sleepiness getting
the better of me. I had drawn the bottle out, recorked it, and put
it away again; but this was no sooner done than I fell in a sleepy
swoon on the roadside.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no idea how long I slept: there is neither day nor night
down there, only a dim sort of twilight, which at times becomes
illuminated by the phosphorescent rays of fishes, or the fitful
gleam of ocean glow-worms. I was startled from my swoon by a
rattling, dragging noise, and came very near being scooped up by an
uncouth-looking iron thing which was attached to a cable. It
flashed upon me, stupid as I was, that this must be a deep-sea
dredge; and <!-- Page 93 --><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>as I
was not at all inclined to be hauled up on shipboard, in a lot of
mud and shells as a rare specimen of the sea, I got as quickly out
of the way as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;But it was now time for me to get on <i>terra firma,</i> as
Knops would say, or dry land, as I prefer to put it. Among the
beautiful vermilion leaves or tentacles of the curious half animals
and half flowers I observed a vine not unlike the honeysuckle, only
of tougher fibre. On this I clambered up to take a look about me,
and discovered that I was much nearer shore than I supposed. Hardly
had I done this when, to my horror, I saw the arms of an octopus
stretching towards me, its horid beak projecting from between its
ugly eyes. More alarmed than at any previous danger, I strove to
retain my self-command, but the fearful creature was already
touching me. Remembering, with wits sharpened by distress, the
effect of the drug in my little bottle, I drew out the cork, and
making a sudden lunge, dashed the ether in its face&mdash;if you
can so call any part of its disgusting head.</p>
<p>&quot;Instantly it lost all power over its members, curled up in a
writhing, wriggling mass, and I with a bound reached the sandy
shore.&quot;</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4><!-- Page 94 --><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>CHAPTER
XI</h4>
<p>Paz, taking a long breath, and looking at Leo to see the effect
of his narrative, went on:</p>
<p>&quot;It was quite time for me to be on land, for in the moonlight,
which bathed everything in silver, were to be seen troops of fays
hurrying to the festival. Some sailed along the shore in mussel
shells, others were on the backs of black swans whose bills looked
like coral, and others were skimming along with their own gauzy
wings, or lolling luxuriously on the feathers of flamingoes.</p>
<p>&quot;I joined the ones on foot, and with them reached the
plantation, which presented a scene of great brilliancy. Gold and
silver ferns hedged the rose-leaf path which led to the bower of
beauty; on every leaf were myriads of fireflies, and glowing from
higher plants bearing many-hued flowers were Brazilian beetles.
Plunging into the thicket, I made a hasty toilet at a brook-side,
and then rejoined the advancing guests. The bell-bird could be
heard clearly summoning our approach, while sweetest
<!-- Page 95 --><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>warblers poured
out their melody. The throne was formed of the Santo-Spirito
flowers, and beneath the wings of its dove-like calyx was the
lovely fay in whose honor was all this gayety, surrounded by her
young companions.</p>
<p>&quot;Approaching quickly, I unstrapped my package, took the satin
case from my pocket, and fell upon my knees in the customary
manner; perceiving which, the beautiful being motioned for me to
rise, and with the most unassuming grace received my burden. As she
unfolded the lace from its silken cover a cry of delight escaped
her, and shaking out its gossamer folds she threw it over her head.
With all the care I could use I had laid bare the block of ice,
which shone like silver in the moonbeams, and now with a sudden
blow of my dagger I cleft the ice, and lifted out the wreath,
placing it as I did so on the head of the fay.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no time for ceremony. Had I waited to pass it from
hand to hand of the attendants it would have been gone. There was a
hush over all as I crowned the fay. Each snowy star stood out in
perfect beauty. She alone could not see its peerless charm. But I
had provided for this. Chipping off a thin
<!-- Page 96 --><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>layer of the
ice-block, I laid a silver-lined leaf from a neighboring bough
behind it, and held this mirror before the fay's wondering eyes.
Never have I seen anything so beautiful or so fleeting. Even as I
held the reflected image before its reality, drops as of dew began
falling over the lace, and in a moment the wreath was gone.</p>
<p>&quot;Like a little child robbed of a treasure, the look of wonder
and delight gave place to one of bewildered disappointment. She
turned a questioning gaze upon me.</p>
<p>&quot;'Alas!' said I, 'most sovereign lady, 'tis not in elfin power
to reproduce this wreath; it was the emblem of human life, as
brief, as fleeting. My Queen desired me to bring it. I have met
with great difficulties in so doing, but none has saddened me like
your disappointment.'</p>
<p>&quot;With eager sweetness she bade her cavaliers respond. They
assured me of her gratitude and delight, and bade me welcome. The
warbling birds again started their liquid strains, and a mazy dance
began which resembled a fluttering band of snowy butterflies
tangled in a silvery web. Slipping off, I came to the side of a
lake on which were boats and Indian canoes of the
<!-- Page 97 --><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>moccasin flower.
Here I rested, watching the measures of the dance, and taking
little refreshing sips of cocoa-nut milk. A swift-winged night-hawk
having been placed at my disposal, I had a safe and speedy journey
home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And is that all?&quot; inquired Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Paz, &quot;for here comes Master Knops.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo thanked Paz warmly, and turned towards Knops, who, with hat
in hand, stood gravely waiting to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it the wish of Prince Leo to make further explorations, or
will he now return to his father and his home?&quot;</p>
<p>With some self-reproach at having quite forgotten that he had a
father and a home, Leo said he was ready to return.</p>
<p>&quot;And may his humble servants, the distinguished savant Paz and
the Master Professor Knops, have the pleasant assurance of Prince
Leo's satisfaction at this visit?&quot; asked Knops, still in the most
formal manner.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot thank you half as I should like to do,&quot; replied Leo,
&quot;but I hope to be able to show you that your entertainment and
instruction have not been wasted.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 98 --><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>&quot;Come, then,
we will go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Adieu,&quot; said Paz. &quot;Look out for me some fine frosty night when
you are skating. You may think you see some of your furry friends
startled out of their winter sleep, but just give a whistle, and
say 'Paz,' and I will be with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Leo. &quot;I hope it will be soon that I shall see
you.&quot;</p>
<p>But Knops was off and he had to follow. Away they went, climbing
and clambering, slipping and sliding, crawling and jumping, through
forests of coal, over mines of iron, and beside walls glittering
with silver. Presently, however, Leo found himself where they had
started from, viz., his own cellar door, and Knops preparing to
leave him. Dropping his ceremonious manner, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry to bid you farewell, my dear boy; I have become
heartily interested in you and your welfare. The only souvenir I
have to offer is this little compass; it is a mere trifle, but the
needle has the power of finding precious metals. Learn how to make
it useful. Good-bye.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo found himself alone. He pushed open the cellar door, and
mounted the steps to the <!-- Page 99 --><a name="Page_99"
id="Page_99"></a>kitchen. It was early morning, and the cocks were
crowing lustily. The one old deaf woman was striving to make a fire
burn, but the wood was wet and she found it difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are all the people?&quot; shouted Leo in her ear, for he well
knew her infirmity.</p>
<p>&quot;Gone&mdash;all gone,&quot; she answered.</p>
<p>&quot;And my father, where is he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In bed yet, and he had better stay there, for I've no breakfast
for him.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo suspected what was the matter. Taking a basket from a peg,
and a bowl from the dresser, he went out into the fields.
Everything was sodden with the rain, but the birds were singing
with all their might; those that were not were repairing the
ravages of the storm.</p>
<p>&quot;Even the birds are busy at their nests,&quot; thought Leo;
&quot;Everything, every creature, has its work to do. Shall I alone be
idle? Never.&quot;</p>
<p>Putting aside the wet boughs, which sprinkled him well, he
sought an old tree-trunk for its store of honey. Filling his bowl
with this, and his basket with fresh eggs, he returned to the
monastery. Here he helped the old woman with the fire, and between
them they soon had the kettle steaming. The tray with his father's
<!-- Page 100 --><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>breakfast was
made ready, and with his own hands he took it to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Leo, my long-lost son,&quot; exclaimed Morpheus at sight of him,
&quot;Where have you spent the night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In Dream-land,&quot; was Leo's reply; and then, without preface, he
asked of his parent the privilege of looking over his accounts, and
doing what he could to assist him in his difficulties. Morpheus
smiled indifferently, but gave Leo his keys, with permission to do
as he pleased.</p>
<p>All the morning Leo puzzled his brain examining books and
papers, with little result. Then he saddled his horse, rode into
the nearest town, and sought a lawyer whom his father knew. To him
he related their grievances, telling him that he was sure their
property, well managed, could be made to yield handsome returns,
and informing him of his wonderful compass, which could indicate
the presence of minerals. The lawyer was not very sanguine, but he
put a young clerk in charge of the matter, who, becoming much
interested, looked up his residence at the monastery, and went to
work with diligence. Under his guidance Leo studied and strove to
regain their former prosperity. Laborers were eager
<!-- Page 101 --><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>to resume
their duties as soon as they saw the prospect of payment. Crops
became abundant. By the aid of Leo's compass&mdash;which was only a
scientific novelty yet to be discovered&mdash;mines were opened and
vast wealth displayed.</p>
<p>And Leo had become a different lad. No longer idle and careless,
with slow and lingering tread, he was now alert, vigorous, and
manly. The servants were glad to return and obey his wishes. The
monastery was rebuilt and repaired. Lawns and gardens were in trim
array. Warm tapestries and curtains lined the bare walls and
windows, while ivy and rose clambered without.</p>
<p>Even Morpheus, roused from his invalidism, rewrote his poems,
sent them to a publisher, and favored all his friends with copies
bound in blue velvet, with his monogram in silver on the covers.
His pride in his son became so great that at Leo's request he
undertook to renew the library, and the time that he had spent in
bed was devoted to the step-ladder. It was in this way he
discovered that their name had been incorrectly written. For his
own part he did not care to make any change, but he insisted that
Leo should use the portion omitted, which an
<!-- Page 102 --><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>old copy of
the Doomsday-book had revealed to him, and sign himself in full,
&quot;Leo Sans Lazybones.&quot;</p>
<p>Christmas was approaching; not a green Christmas, but an icy,
snowy, frozen one, with holly wreaths on his shoulders and a
plum-pudding in his hands.</p>
<p>The monastery was full of guests, relatives of Morpheus. These
guests were all poor&mdash;in one way&mdash;but they had a wealth
of their own which made them delightful to Leo. They were poets and
painters and scribblers, and as merry as larks; and as they all
admired each others productions, there was no end of cheerful
nonsense. The children, however, were the brightest of all. Each
child was as merry as it was lovely, and the painters were almost
frantic in their efforts to make Christmas cards of them, while the
poets cudgelled their brains for rhymes.</p>
<p>To prevent too much industry in that way, Leo had induced them
all to put on their skates on Christmas-eve, and glide over the
frozen ponds, while he made ready the tree which stood in the great
hall.</p>
<p>It was an immense spruce, all powdered with
<!-- Page 103 --><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>silvery
fringe, and Leo had only to tie on the little gilt tags numbered to
correspond with the packages of gifts, which were heaped on
surrounding tables, and fasten on the candles of red and blue wax.
When this was done he put on his own skates, for it was yet too
early to light the tree, and away he went skimming after the
shouting, laughing crowd of friends and relatives.</p>
<p>Suddenly a squirrel darted from its hole, and went scudding
across the river. Leo started in pursuit, giving a low whistle.
Instantly it stopped, sat upon its haunches, threw off its skin,
and out stepped Paz.</p>
<p>&quot;Good-evening, my dear Prince, good-evening; we are well met;
just in time to exchange Christmas greetings. I have been looking
for you lately, but you seemed always so occupied that there was no
chance for me. You have no idea how pleased Knops is to hear of
your prosperity. He has sent for me a dozen times lately merely to
express his satisfaction; and he wants me to ask a favor of you,
which I know already you will grant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anything in my power, dear Paz,&quot; replied Leo, eagerly.</p>
<p><!-- Page 104 --><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>&quot;Of
course; and we know how good a use you make of your power. Times
are greatly changed. You are benefiting every one about you; I hear
it on all sides. We are proud to be your friends. All that Knops
asks is that in clearing up your property, and cutting down all the
rank growth of weeds, you will spare a patch of wild-flowers here
and there, and all the empty birds' nests. Leave these for the use
of our children, and we will be greatly obliged.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that is a mere nothing; can I in any other way serve you?&quot;
asked Leo.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Paz, &quot;Not that I know of. I am on my way now to see
some new minerals supposed to be similar to those of the moon. I
haven't much faith in them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How about the diamonds?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't mention them. I shall never try my hand at those again;
and you, if you are wise, will be contented to let Nature remain
her own chemist. Adieu. A very merry Christmas to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The same to you,&quot; echoed Leo, but Paz was already muffled in
his furs and running rapidly away.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>
<h5>THE WIND HARP</h5>
<p>&quot;Oh, Lisa, how many stars there are to-night! and how long it
takes to count just a few!&quot; said a weak voice from a little bed in
a garret room.</p>
<p>&quot;You will tire yourself, dear, if you try to do that; just shut
your eyes up tight, and try to sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you put my harp in the window? there may be a breeze after
a while, and I want to know very much if there is any music in
those strings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where did you get them, my darling,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From Joe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Joe, the fiddler?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; he brought me a handful of old catgut; he says he does not
play any more at dances; he is so old and lame that they like a
younger darkey <!-- Page 106 --><a name="Page_106"
id="Page_106"></a>who knows more fancy figures, and can be
livelier. He <i>is</i> very black, Lisa, and I am almost afraid of
him; but he is so kind, and he tells me stories about his young
days, and all the gay people he used to see. Hark! that is my harp;
oh, Lisa, is it not heavenly?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said poor, tired Lisa, half asleep, after her
long day's work of standing in a shop.</p>
<p>Phil's harp was a shallow box, across which he had fastened some
violin strings rather loosely; and Phil himself was an invalid boy
who had never known what it was to be strong and hardy, able to
romp and run, or leap and shout. He had neither father nor mother,
but no one could have loved him more or have been any gentler or
more considerate than was Lisa&mdash;poor, plain Lisa&mdash;who
worked early and late to pay for Phil's lodging in the top of the
old house where they lived, and whose whole earthly happiness
consisted in making Phil happy and comfortable. It was not always
easy to do this, for Phil was a strange child; aside from the pain
that he suffered, he had odd fancies and strange likings, the
result of his illness and being so much alone. And Lisa could not
<!-- Page 107 --><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>always
understand him, for she lived among other people&mdash;rough,
plain, careless people, for whom she toiled, and who had no such
thoughts as Phil had.</p>
<p>From the large closet that served as her bedroom Lisa often
heard Phil talking, talking, talking, now to this thing, now to
that, as if it were real and had a personality; sometimes his words
were addressed to a rose-bush she had brought him, or the pictures
of an old volume she had found on a stall of cheap books at a
street corner, or the little plaster cast that an image-seller had
coaxed her to purchase. Then, again, he would converse, with his
knife and fork or plate, ask them where they came from, how they
were made, and of what material. No answer coming, he would invent
all sorts of answers, making them reply in his own words.</p>
<p>Lisa was so used to these imaginary conversations that they did
not seem strange to her.</p>
<p>Phil had, too, a passion for music, and would listen intently to
the commonest strains of a hand-organ, and Lisa had given him a
little toy harmonica, from which he would draw long, sweet tones
and chords with much satisfaction.</p>
<p>Old Joe, who blackened boots for some of the
<!-- Page 108 --><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>lodgers, had
heard the child's attempts at music, and had brought his violin and
played for him. One day, happening to leave it for a while on the
window-ledge, Phil's quick ear had detected a low vibration from
the instrument. This circumstance, and something he had read about
a wind harp, had given him the wish to make one&mdash;with what
success he was anxious to find out, when Lisa laid it in the open
window for him.</p>
<p>A soft south wind was blowing, and, as Phil spoke, it had
stirred the loose strings of the rude Aeolian harp, and a slight
melodious sound had arisen, which Phil had thought so beautiful. He
drew his breath even more softly, lest he should lose the least
tone, and finding that Lisa was really asleep, propped himself up
higher on his pillows, and gazed out at the starlit heavens.</p>
<p>He often talked to the stars, but very softly and wonderingly,
and somehow he could never find any answers that suited him; but
to-night, as the breeze made a low soft music come from his wind
harp, filling him with delight, it seemed to him that a voice was
accompanying the melody, and that the stars had something to do
with it; for, as he gazed, he saw a troop of little beings with
gauzy wings fluttering over the <!-- Page 109 --><a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109"></a>window-ledge, and upon the brow of each twinkled
a tiny star, and the leading one of all this bevy of wee people
sang:</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Come from afar,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here we are! here we
are!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From you Silver Star,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fays of the Wind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To children kind.&quot;</span></p>
<p>&quot;How lovely they are!&quot; thought Phil. &quot;And so these really are
fairies. I never saw any before. They have wings like little white
butterflies, and how tiny their hands and feet, and what graceful
motions they have as they dance over my harp! They seem to be
examining it to find out where the music comes from; but no, of
course they know all about it. I wonder if they would talk to
me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we will be very glad to,&quot; said a soft little voice in
reply to his thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;I was afraid I would frighten you away if I spoke,&quot; said Phil,
gently.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; replied the fairy who had addressed him; &quot;We are in the
habit of talking to children, though they do not always know
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what do you tell them?&quot; asked Phil, eagerly.</p>
<p><!-- Page 110 --><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>&quot;All sorts
of nice things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you tell them all they want to know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; laughed the fairy, with a silvery little voice like a
canary-bird's. &quot;We cannot do that, for we do not know enough to be
able to: some children are much wiser than we. I dare say you
are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed I am not,&quot; said Phil, a little sadly; &quot;There are so many
things that puzzle me. I thought that perhaps, as you came from the
stars, you knew something of astronomy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a long, long word that is!&quot; laughed the fairy again. &quot;but
we are wind fairies; and yet the Father of the Winds is called
Astraeus: that sounds something like your long word, does it
not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds more like Astrea, and that means a star.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, where did you learn so much?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw it in a big book called a dictionary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Another long word. Doesn't your head ache?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes, not now. I have not any books now, except
picture-books.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you ever have?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes; when papa was living we had books
<!-- Page 111 --><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>and pictures
and many beautiful things; but there was a great fire, and all
sorts of trouble, and now I have only Lisa. But Lisa does not
understand as papa did; it was he showed me that word in the
dictionary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don't say that great ugly word again! Shall I tell my
friends to make some more music?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, please.&quot;</p>
<p>The wind fairy struck her little hands together, and waved her
wings. In a moment the little white troop danced over the strings
of the harp, and brought out sweet, wild strains, that made Phil
nearly cry for joy. They seemed to be dancing as they did it, for
they would join hands and sway to and fro; then, parting, they
wound in and out in graceful, wreath-like motions, and the tiny
stars on their foreheads flashed like diamonds. Up and down they
went, the length of the strings, then across, then back again; and
all the time the sweet wild music kept vibrating. &quot;How lovely! how
lovely!&quot; said Phil, when there was a pause.</p>
<p>&quot;I am so glad you like it! we often make music for people, and
they hardly hear it,&quot; said the fairy.</p>
<p><!-- Page 112 --><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>&quot;I do not
see how they can help hearing,&quot; said Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, I'll tell you how: we frequently are in the tree-tops, or
whirling about low bushes; every soft breeze that blows has some of
our music in it, for there are many of us; and yet very few people
pay attention to these sounds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When the wind screams and roars in winter, is it you, then, who
does that too?&quot; asked Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; said the fairy, rustling her wings in some displeasure.
&quot;We are of the South Wind only, and have no such rude doings; I
hope I may never have any work to do for the North Wind, he is so
blustery. Now it is time you went to sleep, and we cannot stay
longer, for if the moon rises we cannot see our star-beams, and
might lose our way. We will just fan you a little, and you will
soon be in Dream-land.&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, Phil saw her beckon to her troupe, and they all
flocked about him, dazzling him so with their starry coronets that
he was forced to shut his eyes, and as he closed them he felt a
gentle wafting as of a hundred little wings about his forehead, and
in another moment he was asleep.</p>

<h4><!-- Page 113 --><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>CHAPTER
II</h4>
<h5>PHIL'S NEW FRIEND</h5>
<p>Old black Joe had not always been either a boot-black or
fiddler. In his youthful days he had been a house-servant, and had
prided himself on his many accomplishments&mdash;his dexterity at
dinners, his grace at evening parties, the ease and unconcern with
which he could meet embarrassing emergencies at either. But times
had changed for him: his old employers had died, a scolding wife
had made his home unhappy, he had lost the little money he had
saved, and he was no longer the bright, cheerful young fellow he
had been. Age and rheumatism had made him crusty; but beneath the
outward manner, which sometimes was very cross, he had a tender
heart and a pitiful nature.</p>
<p>Of late years he had picked up enough for his support in the
many little ways incident to city life. He could whitewash, sweep
chimneys, run on errands&mdash;or rather walk on them, and that,
too, very slowly. He shovelled snow and carried coal, sawed wood
and helped the <!-- Page 114 --><a name="Page_114"
id="Page_114"></a>servants at whose homes he was employed.</p>
<p>His occupations took him about to many houses, but he always
irritated the people with whom he came in contact by invariably
assuring them that their masters and mistresses were not of the
real stuff that ladies and gentlemen of <i>his</i> day were made
of; that fine feathers did not make fine birds; that people
nowadays were all alike, and had no manners.</p>
<p>He made one exception only, in favor of a maiden lady whose
parents he had known, whose servants were kind to him, and whose
retired and dignified way of living quite suited his
fastidiousness.</p>
<p>This was a Miss Schuyler; and nothing pleased Joe more than to
have this one person, whom he regarded with unqualified admiration,
send for him to bestow the monthly allowance she was in the habit
of giving him. On the day that he expected this summons he always
gave an extra touch to his toilet, exchanged his torn coat for a
patched one, his slouch hat for a very much worn beaver adorned
with a band of rusty crape, and out of the pocket of his coat, but
never upon his hands, was to be seen an old pair of yellow kid
gloves.</p>
<p><!-- Page 115 --><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>In the
course of Joe's wanderings he had chanced to, hear of the invalid
boy Phil, who liked to listen to his fiddle, and it did not take
long to strike up an acquaintance between them.</p>
<p>Often on a rainy day, or when work was dull, Joe would spend an
hour or two with Phil, relieving his loneliness, soothing his pain,
and cheering him with his music and his rambling talk about &quot;old
times&quot; and the people he had seen.</p>
<p>It was the latter part of May, and had been very warm; but Joe
buttoned up his best coat and donned his beaver, for his pay was
due at Miss Schuyler's. She lived in a large house, rather imposing
and handsome, and in the gayest part of the city; but she was by no
means imposing or gay in her own person. A little figure, simply
dressed, a kind face without beauty, a gentle manner, and a certain
gracious kindliness and familiarity had endeared her to Joe. On
this day she was not, as usual, sitting with her work in the
library, where the sun poured in on the bronzes and richly bound
volumes, on the old engravings and the frescoed ceiling&mdash;for
Miss Schuyler liked light and warmth and color&mdash;but she was
away up in the top of the <!-- Page 116 --><a name="Page_116"
id="Page_116"></a>house, directing her maids in the packing of
blankets and woollens and furs, preparatory to leaving her house
for the summer. Joe had mounted stair after stair seeking her, and
by the time he reached her was quite out of breath; this, and the
odor of camphor and cedar-wood, made him sneeze and cough until
Miss Schuyler said to one of the maids in a whisper, &quot;The poor old
soul would have been black in the face had he ever been white.&quot;</p>
<p>To Joe himself she said, very kindly, &quot;My good old friend, you
need not have taken so much trouble to see me; I could have come
down to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Laws, Miss Rachel, I knew you was busy, and nuffin's ever a
trouble to do for you; I go to the tops of houses often&mdash;just
come from one where poor Phil's a-groanin' with pain. That chile'll
die if somebody don't do suthin' fur him soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What child?&quot; asked Miss Schuyler, whose tender point was her
love of children. &quot;You haven't any grandchildren, Joe, have
you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Miss Rachel, de Lord nebber trusted me with any
chil'en.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, who is Phil?&quot; said Miss Schuyler,
<!-- Page 117 --><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>absently;
adding, to one of her maids, &quot;Take care of that afghan; wrap it in
an old linen sheet; it was knitted by a very dear friend, and I do
not want it moth-eaten; I had rather lose a camel's-hair shawl.&quot;
Which evidence or regard seemed very extravagant to the girl who
was obeying instructions, but which Joe thought he appreciated.</p>
<p>&quot;Haven't I tole ye about Phil, Miss Rachel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know. I don't think you have. But come down to my room,
Joe, and then I can listen to your story.&quot;</p>
<p>Giving a few more directions, Miss Rachel led the way to a
lovely sunny room, with flower-baskets in the windows, soft blue
draperies, and delicate appointments. Seating herself at a desk and
pointing Joe to a chair, upon which the old man carefully spread a
silk handkerchief lest his clothes should soil the blue cushions,
she counted out the money due him, and placed it in an envelope,
saying as she did so, &quot;Now tell me about that child.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a white chile, Miss Rachel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I like white children, Joe, though I must confess the
little colored ones are much more interesting,&quot; said Miss Rachel,
smiling.</p>
<p><!-- Page 118 --><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>&quot;I thought
you liked my people, Miss Rachel; but this poor Phil's a
gentleman's son, very much come down far's money goes. He is too
young to know much about it, but the girl who takes care of him was
brought up in his family, and she says they was well off once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what about the boy?&quot; asked Miss Schuyler, a little
impatiently.</p>
<p>&quot;He's a great sufferer, but he's a wonderful chile. He loves to
have me play for him, and then he tells me the thoughts that come
to him from the music. I's no great player, Miss Rachel,&quot; said Joe,
modestly, &quot;but you'd think I was, to hear him talk. He sees fairies
and he dreams beautiful things, and his big brown eyes look as if
he could a'most see 'way up into heaven. Oh, he's a strange chile;
but he'll die if he stays up in that garret room and nebber sees
the green fields he's so hungry for.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Rachel's eyes were moist, but she took a card and pencil
from her desk. &quot;Where does he live&mdash;in what street and what
number?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Miss Rachel&mdash;You jess go up the Avenue, and
turn down the fourth or fifth street, and up a block or two, and
it's the fust house with a high stoop and green shutters. I
<!-- Page 119 --><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>allers go in
the alleyway, so I forgit numbers.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Schuyler bit her lip to keep from smiling, thought a
moment, scribbled a memorandum, rang the bell, and gave some more
directions; left the room, and came back with her bonnet on. &quot;Can
you show me the way to Phil's house, Joe?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Course I can, Miss Rachel,&quot; replied the old man, delighted that
his words had aroused his listener's sympathies.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not very far; he's all alone, 'cause Lisa has to be away
all day. And I shouldn't wonder&quot;&mdash;here he dropped his voice to
a whisper&mdash;&quot;if sometimes he was hungry; but he'd nebber say
so.&quot;</p>
<p>This latter remark made Miss Schuyler bid Joe wait for her in
the hall, while she went to a closet, found a basket, in which she
placed a snowy napkin, some biscuit, some cold chicken, and a few
delicious little cakes. In her pocket she put a little flask of
some strong cordial she had found of service on her many errands of
charity.</p>
<p>How proud Joe was to be her escort! but how meekly he walked
behind the lady whose footsteps he thought were those of a real
gentle<!-- Page 120 --><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>woman,
the only one to whom he would accord this compliment, although he
passed many elegant dames in gay attire.</p>
<p>The little gray figure, with its neat, quiet simplicity, was his
embodiment of elegance, for somehow Joe had detected the delicate
perfume of a sweet nature and a loving heart&mdash;a heart full of
Christian charity and unselfishness.</p>
<p>They walked for some distance, and the day was so warm that Miss
Schuyler moderated her usual rapid pace to suit the old man's
feebler steps. Off the Avenue a long way, up another, down a side
street, until, amid a crowded, disagreeable neighborhood, Joe
stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;You had better lead me still, Joe. The boy might be frightened
or annoyed at seeing a stranger: I dare say he's nervous. Go up,
and I will wait outside the door while you ask him if I may come
and see him. Wait, there's a flower-stall a little way from here; I
will get a bunch. Take my basket, and I will be back in a few
moments. I am glad I thought of the flowers; children always like
them.&quot;</p>
<p>She hastened off, while Joe leaned on his cane and muttered
blessings upon her; but some rude boys beginning to chaff him, he
turned on them <!-- Page 121 --><a name="Page_121"
id="Page_121"></a>with his usual crustiness, and quite forgot his
beatitudes.</p>
<p>Miss Schuyler came back in a few minutes with a lovely bunch of
bright blossoms embosomed in geranium leaves.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, then, Joe, this shall be my card; take it in, and tell
Phil I am coming.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God bless you, Miss Rachel!&quot; was all Joe could reply.</p>
<p>Miss Rachel had her own way of doing things. It was nothing new
for her to carry flowers and dainties to the sick poor. She had
been much with sick people, and she knew that those who have no
luxuries and few necessaries care for the things which do not
really sustain life quite as much as do those who can command
both.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III</h4>
<h5>PHIL HAS A VISITOR</h5>
<p>Phil was alone, as indeed he was always, except on Sundays, or
the few half-holidays that came to Lisa. Once in a while Lisa
begged off, or paid another woman for doing an extra share of work
in her place, if Phil was really
<!-- Page 122 --><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>too ill for
her to leave him. The hot sun was pouring into the garret room,
though a green paper shade made it less blinding, and Phil was
lying back in a rocking-chair, wrapped in a shawl. On a small table
beside him were some loose pictures from a newspaper, a pencil or
two, and an old sketch-book, a pitcher of water, and an empty
plate.</p>
<p>The boy opened his closed eyes as Joe came in, after knocking,
and looked surprised.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Joe, what is the matter?&quot; he asked. &quot;You do not come twice
a day very often.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Joe, &quot;Nor are you always a-sufferin' as you was this
mornin'. I've come to know how you are, and to bring you
<i>that</i>,&quot; said he triumphantly putting the nosegay before the
child's eyes.</p>
<p>The boy nearly snatched the flowers out of Joe's hand in his
eagerness to get them, and putting them to his face he kissed them
in his delight.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Joe dear, I am <i>so</i> much obliged! Oh, you darling,
lovely flowers, how sweet you are! how delicious you smell! I never
saw anything more beautiful. Where did they come from, Joe?&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 123 --><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>&quot;Ah, you
can't guess, I reckon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, of course not; they are so sweet, so perfect, they take all
my pain away; and I have been nearly smothered with the heat
to-day. Just see how cool they look, as if they had just been
picked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a pity the one who sent 'em can't hear ye. Shall I bring
her in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who, Joe&mdash;who do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Joe means me,&quot; said a soft voice; &quot;I sent them to you, and I am
Miss Rachel Schuyler, an old friend of Joe's. I want to know you,
Phil, and see if I cannot do something for that pain I hear you
suffer so much with. Shall I put the flowers in water, so that they
will last a little longer? Ah, no! you want to hold them, and
breathe their sweet fragrance.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Schuyler had opened the door so gently, and appeared so
entirely at home, that Phil took her visit quite as a matter of
course, and though astonished, was not at all flurried. He fastened
his searching gaze upon her, over the flowers which he held close
to his lips, and made up his mind what to say. At last, after
deliberating, he said, simply, &quot;I thank you very much.&quot; His
thoughts ran this way: &quot;She is a real lady, a
<!-- Page 124 --><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>kind, lovely
woman; she has on a nice dress&mdash;nicer than Lisa's; she has
little hands, and what a soft pleasant voice! I wonder if my mother
looked like her?&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Schuyler's thoughts were very pitiful. She was much moved
by the pale little face and brilliant eyes, the pleased, shy
expression, the air of refinement, and the very evident pain and
poverty. She could not say much, and to hide her agitation took up
the sketch-book, saying, &quot;May I look in this, please?&quot;</p>
<p>Phil nodded, still over the flowers.</p>
<p>As the leaves were opened, one after the other, Miss Schuyler
became still more interested. The sketches were simply rude copies
of newspaper pictures, but there was no doubt of the taste and
talent that had directed their pencilling.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you ever had any teaching, Phil?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No, ma'am,&quot; answered Joe for Phil, thinking he might be
bashful. &quot;He hasn't had no larnin' nor teachin' of anythin'; but it
is what he wants, poor chile, and he often asks me things I can't
answer for want of not knowin' nuthin' myself.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 125 --><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>&quot;And what
is this?&quot; said Miss Schuyler, touching the box with violin strings
across it, which was on a chair beside her.</p>
<p>&quot;Please don't touch it,&quot; answered Phil, anxiously; then fearing
he had been rude, added, &quot;It is my harp, and I am so afraid, if it
is handled, that the fairies will never dance on it again. You
ought to hear what lovely music comes out of it when the wind
blows.&quot;</p>
<p>Phil spoke as if fairies were his particular friends. Miss
Schuyler looked at him pitifully, thinking him a little
light-headed. Joe nodded, and looked wise, as much as to say, &quot;I
told you so.&quot;</p>
<p>Just then Phil's pain came on again, and it was as much as he
could do not to scream; but Miss Rachel saw the pallor of his face,
and turning to Joe, asked:</p>
<p>&quot;Does he have a doctor? Is anything done for him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nuthin', Miss Rachel, that I knows of. I never knew of his
havin' a doctor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor child!&quot; said Miss Rachel, smoothing his forehead, and
fanning him. Then she tucked a pillow behind him, and did all so
gently that Phil took her hand and kissed it&mdash;it eased
<!-- Page 126 --><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>his pain so
to have just these little things done for him. Then she poured a
little of her cordial in a glass with some water, and he thought he
had never tasted anything so refreshing. She sent Joe after some
ice, and spreading her napkins out on Phil's table, set all her
little store of dainties before him, tempting the child to eat in
spite of his pain.</p>
<p>Phil thought it was all the fairies' doing and not
Joe's&mdash;poor pleased Joe&mdash;who looked on with a radiant
face of delight. Phil would not eat unless Joe took one of his
cakes, so the old fellow munched one to please him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Miss Schuyler gazed at the boy with more and more
interest; a something she could hardly define attracted her. At
first it had been his suffering and poverty, for her heart was
tender, and she was always doing kind deeds; but now as she looked
at him she saw in his face a likeness to some one she had loved,
the look of an old and familiar friend, a look also of thought and
ability, which only needed fostering to make of Phil a person of
great use in the world&mdash;one who might be a leader rather than
a follower in the path of industry and usefulness. The grateful
little kiss on her hand <!-- Page 127 --><a name="Page_127"
id="Page_127"></a>had gone deeply into her heart. Phil must no
longer be left alone: he must have good food and medical care and
fresh air, and Lisa must be consulted as to how these things should
be gained. So while Phil nibbled at the good things, and Joe
chuckled and talked, half to himself and half to Phil, Miss
Schuyler wrote a note to Lisa, asking her to come and see her that
evening, if convenient, explaining how her interest had been
aroused in Phil, and that she wanted to know more about him, and
wanted to help him, and was sure she could make his life more
comfortable, and that Lisa must take her interference kindly, for
it was offered in a loving spirit. Then she folded the note, and
gave it to Phil for Lisa, and arranging all his little comforts
about him, bade him good-bye.</p>
<p>Phil thought her face like that of an angel's when she stooped
to kiss him; and after Joe, too, had hobbled off, promising to come
again soon with his violin, he took up his pencil, and tried to
sketch Miss Schuyler. Face after face was drawn, but none to his
taste; first the nose was crooked, then the eyes were too small,
then the mouth would be twisted, and just as Lisa came
<!-- Page 128 --><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>in, with a
tired and flushed face, he threw his pencil away and began to
sob.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, my dear Phil,&quot; said Lisa, in surprise, &quot;Are you so very
miserable to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I am not miserable at all,&quot; said Phil, between his tears;
&quot;That is, I have had pain enough, but I have had such a lovely
visitor!&mdash;Joe brought her&mdash;and I wanted to make a little
picture of her, so that you could see what she looked like, and I
cannot. Oh dear! I wish I could ever do anything!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, you are tired; drink this nice milk and you will be
better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have had delicious things to eat, and I saved some for you,
Lisa. Look!&quot; and he showed her the little parcel of cakes Miss
Schuyler had left. &quot;And see the big piece of ice in my glass.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some one has been kind to my boy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; and here is a note for you; and you must dress up, Lisa,
when you go to see our new friend.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa looked down at her shabby garments; they were all she had;
but she did not tell Phil that her only black silk had been sold
long ago. She read the note, and her face brightened.
<!-- Page 129 --><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>There seemed
a chance of better things for Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;I will go to-night, if you can spare me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not till you have rested, Lisa; and you must drink all that
milk your own self. Did you ever hear of Miss Schuyler?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Lisa, meditating; &quot;The name is not strange
to me. But there used to be so many visitors at your father's
house, Phil dear, that I cannot be sure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is so nice and tender and kind&mdash;Have you had a
tiresome day, Lisa,&quot; added Phil, quickly, fearing Lisa might think
herself neglected in his eager praise of the new friend.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, rather; but I can go. So Joe brought her here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; and see these flowers&mdash;yes, you must have some. Put
them in your belt, Lisa.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, flowers don't suit my old clothes, child; keep them
yourself, dear. Well, it is a long lane that has no turning,&quot; she
said, half to herself and half to Phil. &quot;Perhaps God has sent us
Miss Schuyler to do for you what I have not been able to; but I
have tried&mdash;he knows I have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I know it too, dear Lisa,&quot; said Phil pulling her down to
him, and throwing both arms <!-- Page 130 --><a name="Page_130"
id="Page_130"></a>around her. &quot;No one could be kinder, Lisa; and I
love this old garret room, just because it is your home and mine.
Now get me my harp, and when you have put it in the window you can
go; and I will try not to have any pain, so that you won't have to
rub me to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear child!&quot; was all Lisa could say, as she did what he asked
her to do, and then left him alone.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER IV</h4>
<h5>A PROMISE OF BETTER TIMES</h5>
<p>When Phil was alone again, he waited impatiently for the long
twilight to end in darkness, and the stars to come out. It seemed a
very long time. Once in a while a faint murmur came from his harp,
but it was a mere breathing of sound, and he turned restlessly in
his chair. Then he closed his eyes and waited again, and his
waiting was rewarded by a small voice in his ear whispering,</p>
<p>&quot;Here we are! here we are!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Phil, &quot;I thought you never would come again.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 131 --><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>&quot;Tut, tut,
child, you must not be so doubtful,&quot; said the little voice again,
and the starry coronet gleamed in his eyes. &quot;I have brought you
some sweet odors of wild-flowers, and spicy breath of pine and
hemlock, for I thought you needed a tonic.&quot;</p>
<p>Phil smelled something exquisite as she spoke, but all he said
was,</p>
<p>&quot;What is a tonic?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something the doctors give when children are pale and thin, and
do not have enough fresh air. I don't pretend to know what it
means, but I often go to see sick children in hospitals, and so I
hear about such things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hark! is that my wind harp?&mdash;why, it sounds like water
dropping and gurgling over stones.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is the song of a mountain brook that my friends are singing
as they dance over your harp. Look!&quot;</p>
<p>Phil looked, and saw the flock of fairies like white butterflies
swarming again over his harp, and heard the soft, sweet singing
which kept time to their steps.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, how beautiful! how beautiful!&quot; said Phil.</p>
<p><!-- Page 132 --><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>&quot;When you
hear a brook singing, you must remember us,&quot; said the fairy.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed I will; but I am afraid I shall never hear one: only the
hoarse cries of the street and the rumbling of wagons come to me
here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, better times are coming; then you will not need us.&quot;</p>
<p>Phil lay still in his chair, listening intently; the white
figures glanced in shadowy indistinctness across the window, only
the starry ray from each little brow lighting their dance. They
swept up and down, and swayed like flowers in a breeze, and still
the little clear notes of their song fell like dripping water in
cool cascades. Now it flowed smoothly and softly, again it seemed
to dash and foam among pebbly nooks.</p>
<p>&quot;Does it rest you? are you better?&quot; asked the one little fairy
who did all the talking.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, so much!&quot; said Phil.</p>
<p>After a while the song stopped, and the fairies drew all
together in a cluster, and were quite still.</p>
<p>&quot;What does that mean?&quot; asked Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;They are disturbed; there is a storm coming. We shall have to
return.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 133 --><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>&quot;I am so
sorry! I wanted to know more about you, and to see what you
wear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mortals must not approach us too nearly. We may draw near to
you. See, I will stand before you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You seem to be all moonshine,&quot; said Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the fairy, laughing merrily; &quot;These robes of ours
are of mountain mist, spangled with star-dust so fine that it makes
us only glisten. We have to wear the lightest sort of fabric, so
that we are not hindered in our long flights.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know flower fairies?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; but we are of a very different race. I suppose you thought
we dressed in rose-leaves and rode on humble-bees, but we do not;
we are more&mdash;now for a long word&mdash;more ethereal.&quot; And
again the fairy laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Ether means air,&quot; said Phil, quite proudly. &quot;Do you know any
fairy stories?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; shall I tell you one next time I come?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh do, please. So you <i>will</i> come again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, if I can. Now I must go. I thought I heard distant
thunder. We must fly so fast&mdash;so fast!
Good-bye&mdash;good-bye.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 134 --><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>There was
a long rumbling of thunder far off in the distance, and a cooler
air in the hot, close room. Phil lay and dreamed, wondering how
long it took the wind fairies to reach their home. Then the sweet,
spicy odors came to him again, and he lifted the languid flowers
Miss Schuyler had brought him, and put them in his glass of
water.</p>
<p>He dreamed of fair green fields and meadows, of silent lakes
bordered with rushes, out of which sprang wild-fowl slowly flapping
their broad wings; of forests thick and dark, where on fallen trees
the green moss had grown in velvet softness; of mountains lifting
their purple tops into the fleecy clouds, and of long, shady
country roads winding in and out and about the hills; of lanes
bordered with blackberry-bushes and sumac, clematis and wild-rose;
of dewy nooks full of ferns; of the songs of birds and the chirp of
insects; and it seemed to him that he must put some of all this
beauty into some shape of his own creation&mdash;picture or poem,
song or speech; and then came a sudden sharp twinge of pain, and
the brightness faded, and the room was dark, and he was hungry, and
only poor little Phil, sick and sad and weary and poor.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4><!-- Page 135 --><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>CHAPTER
V</h4>
<h5>LISA VISITS MISS SCHUYLER</h5>
<p>&quot;So you are Phil's good friend Lisa?&quot; said Miss Rachel Schuyler,
sitting in her cool white wrapper in the dusk of this warm May
evening. &quot;I want to hear more about Phil. The dear child has quite
won my heart, he looks so like a friend of mine whom I have not
seen for many years. How are you related to him, and who were his
parents?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not related to him at all, Miss Schuyler.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No?&quot; in some surprise. &quot;Why, then, have you the care and charge
of him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was brought up in his mother's family as seamstress, and went
to live with her when she married Mr. Randolph, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who did you say? What Mr. Randolph?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Peyton Randolph.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Rachel seemed much overcome, but she controlled herself,
and hurriedly said, &quot;Go on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was no intercourse between the families after the
marriage, for Mrs. Randolph was <!-- Page 136 --><a name="Page_136"
id="Page_136"></a>poor, and they all had been opposed to her. I
suppose you do not care to hear all the details&mdash;how they went
abroad, and Mr. Randolph died there; and while they were absent
their house was burned; and there was no one to take care of Phil
but me, for Phil had been too sick to go with his father and
mother; and Mrs. Randolph did not live long after her return. I
nursed them both&mdash;Phil and his mother; and when she was gone I
came on to the city, thinking I could do better here, but I have
found it hard, very hard, with no friends. Still, I have pretty
steady work now as shopwoman, though I cannot do all that I would
like to do for Phil.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Schuyler was crying.</p>
<p>&quot;Lisa, you good woman, how glad I am I have found you! Phil's
father was the dearest friend I ever had.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Phil's mother gave the child to me, Miss Schuyler.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be alarmed. I do not wish to separate you. How can I ever
thank you enough for telling me all this? And what a noble,
generous creature you are, to be toiling and suffering for a child
no way related to you, and who must
<!-- Page 137 --><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>have friends
fully able to care for him if they would!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love him as if he were my own. Sometimes I have thought I
ought to try and see if any of his relatives would help us, but I
cannot bear to, and so we have just worried along as we could. But
Phil needs a doctor and medicine, and more than I can give
him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He shall have all he needs, and you too,&quot; said Miss Schuyler,
warmly.</p>
<p>At this Lisa broke down, the kind words were so welcome. And the
two women cried together; but not long, for Miss Schuyler rose and
got Lisa some refreshing drink, and made her take off her bonnet
and quiet herself, and then said:</p>
<p>&quot;Now we must plan a change for Phil, and see how soon it can be
accomplished. And you must leave that tiresome shop, and I will
give you plenty of work to do. See, here are some things I bought
to-day that I shall have to wear this summer.&quot;</p>
<p>She opened the packages&mdash;soft sheer lawn and delicate
cambric that gave Lisa a thrill of pleasure just to touch once
more, for she loved her <!-- Page 138 --><a name="Page_138"
id="Page_138"></a>work. &quot;I shall be so glad to sew again, and I
wish I had some of my work to show you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I know you will do it nicely. I am going out of town in a
few days, and I want you and Phil to go with me. Do you think you
can?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am a little afraid,&quot; said Lisa, hesitating, &quot;That we are not
fit to; and yet&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will see to all that. Now I suppose you cannot leave Phil
alone much longer&mdash;besides, there is a shower coming.
To-morrow I will bring a doctor to visit the dear boy, and we will
see what can be done&quot;; and she put a roll of money in Lisa's hand,
assuring her that she should be as independent as she pleased after
a while, and repay her, but that now she needed help, and should
have it, and that henceforth Phil was to be theirs in
partnership.</p>
<p>Lisa hurried away with a light heart. She had indeed toiled and
suffered, striven early and late, for the child of her affections,
and this timely assistance was a source of great joy.</p>
<p>She was too happy to heed the dashing shower which was now
falling. Herself she had never thought of, and her dear Phil now
was to be helped, to be cheered, perhaps to be made strong
<!-- Page 139 --><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>and well, and
able to do all that his poor weak hands had tried to do so
ineffectually.</p>
<p>She opened the door softly when she reached her room. A little
shiver of sweet, sad sounds came from the wind harp. She lighted a
candle, and looked into the pale face of the sleeping child as he
lay in an attitude of weariness and exhaustion, with hands falling
apart, and a feverish flush on his thin cheeks.</p>
<p>&quot;My poor Phil! I hope help has not come too late,&quot; she
whispered, as she began her preparations for his more comfortable
repose.</p>
<p>The next day Miss Schuyler came, as she had promised, and
brought a physician&mdash;a good, kind surgeon&mdash;who examined
Phil, and pulled this joint and that joint, and touched him here
and there, and found out where the pain was, and what caused it,
and said nice, funny things to make him laugh, and told him he
hoped to make him a strong boy yet. And then they whispered a
little about him, and Joe was sent for, and a carriage came, and
Phil was wrapped in a blanket and laid on pillows, and taken out
for a drive alone with Miss Schuyler, who chatted with him, and got
him more flowers; and when they came back there was a nice dinner
<!-- Page 140 --><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>on a tray,
and ice-cream for his dessert, and Joe was to stay with him until
Lisa came home; and before Lisa came there was a nice new trunk
brought in, and several large parcels. And Phil thought he had
never seen such a day of happiness. After his dinner and a nap, and
while Joe Sat and played on his violin, Phil sketched and made a
lovely little picture of flowers and fairies, in his own simple
fashion, to give to Miss Schuyler. And then Lisa came home, and the
parcels were opened; and there were nice new dresses for Lisa, and
a pretty, thin shawl, and a new bonnet; and for Phil there was a
comfortable flannel gown, and soft slippers, and fine handkerchiefs
and stockings; and Phil found a little parcel too for Joe with a
bright bandanna in it, and the old man was very happy.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems like Christmas,&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>Phil thought he had never seen quite such a Christmas, and said,
&quot;It seems more like Fairy-land, and I only hope it will not all
fade away and come to an end, like a bubble bursting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To me,&quot; said Lisa, &quot;It is God's own goodness that has done it
all, for it was He who gave Miss Schuyler her warm, kind
heart.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 141 --><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>&quot;And,
Joe,&quot; said Phil, &quot;We are to go to the country, and you are to go
with us; is not that nice?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very nice, Phil. I'm glad Miss Rachel's found out your father
was her friend.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Joe took up his violin again, and played &quot;Home, Sweet
Home,&quot; and &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;; and Phil fancied the violin was a
bird, and sang of its own free-will, and thinking this reminded him
how soon he would hear the dear wild birds in the woods, and he
wondered if the fairies would come to him there.</p>
<p>Then Joe went home, and Lisa had errands to do, and again she
put the wind harp in the window, and left Phil alone, keeping very
still in expectation of another visit from his fairy friend.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VI</h4>
<h5>THE FAIRY'S STORY</h5>
<p>&quot;I promised you a story,&quot; said the little voice, to his ear
again.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I know you did; can you tell it now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To be sure I can, if I only have time. I
<!-- Page 142 --><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>did not bring
any of my people to-night; they are helping some of the herb elves.
It is a little late in the season, and some blossoms have been slow
in opening, so that we have to urge them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot; asked Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;By coaxing and persuasion for some of them; others we have to
blow upon quite forcibly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am ready for the story when you are,&quot; said Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a wild affair, and one that all children might not care
to hear; but to you, I fancy, nothing comes amiss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I like almost everything,&quot; said Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall begin just as my grandmother used to. Once upon a time,
in the days of enchantment, there was a dreadful old
ogre&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do not make him too dreadful, or I shall have bad dreams,&quot;
interrupted Phil.</p>
<p>The fairy laughed and flapped her little wings. &quot;Now you must
not be afraid; it will all come out right in the end. When I said
the ogre was dreadful, I meant he was ugly-looking; we fairies like
everything beautiful. Shall I go on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, and please forgive me for stopping you.&quot;</p>

<b>THE APPROACH OF THE SWANLIKE BOAT</b></div>
<br />
<p><!-- Page 144 --><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>
<!-- Page 145 --><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>&quot;This ogre was
ugly, with a shaggy head, a shaggy beard, and fierce eyes, and he
lived all by himself in a great stone castle on the shore of a
large lake. His principal pleasure consisted in tormenting
everything and everybody he came near; but if he had any
preference, it was for boys; to tease and ill-use them had the
power of affording him great happiness. Lazy, loitering little
fellows were in especial danger, for he would catch them quite
easily by throwing over their head's the nets he used in fishing,
drag them off to his castle, and keep them in a dungeon until there
would be no chance of discovery, and the boys' parents would think
them lost forever. Thus he would gain a very useful, active set of
laborers for a stone wall he was building, for so afraid were they
of his displeasure, and so fearful that they might be starved,
since the only food they received was dried and salted fish, that
these boys worked like bees in a hive, only it was a sullen,
painful sort of working, for they never sang or shouted, whistled
or talked, and they were thin and wretched, and more like machines
than boys.</p>
<p>&quot;Now in this lake, on the shore of which was the ogre's castle,
was an island, where lived a <!-- Page 146 --><a name="Page_146"
id="Page_146"></a>Princess whom the ogre had bewitched, but who had
also regained her liberty, and near whom the ogre could never again
come; even to land on her island or bathe in the water near would
at once change him into a shark.</p>
<p>&quot;This Princess, passing the ogre's castle in her beautiful swan-like
sailing-boat, had seen the unhappy little boys at work on the stone
wall; her sympathies had been aroused at so sad a sight, and she
determined to wait her chance, and do what she could to relieve
them. The chance came one day when the ogre had gone on a fishing
excursion, from which he would not return till night. He had given
the boys their rations of salt fish, and had commanded them in the
gruffest tones to be sure and do an unusual amount of work in his
absence, or they should all have chains on again; for when they
were first caught he always chained them for fear they might try to
escape; but they so soon lost all spirit and all desire for freedom
that their chains were removed to enable them to work more
easily.</p>
<p>&quot;He had no sooner disappeared in his great clumsy craft, laden
with seines and harpoons, and baskets and jugs, than a whispering
began <!-- Page 147 --><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>among
the boys, a sad sort of sighing and crying, almost like the
whispering of wind in the tree-tops, which changed again to looks
and glances of surprise as a beautiful vessel with silken sails
floated up to the wharf, and a lovely, gracious-looking lady
clothed in white stepped from the boat, and came rapidly towards
them.</p>
<p>&quot;'Boys,' said she, addressing them in a very soft, sweet voice,
'I have come to release you from this cruel bondage; will you trust
me, and go with me?'</p>
<p>&quot;'Yes, yes,' came from more than a dozen little tongues.</p>
<p>&quot;'Come, then, at once. Drop your work, get into my boat, and we
will be off. We have no time to lose, for your cruel master might
possibly change his course and overtake us; then we should be in
great danger.'</p>
<p>&quot;The boys crowded about her, and with a wild cry followed her to
her little vessel, and almost tumbled into it in their delight. It
was with some difficulty that she kept them balanced, and prevented
their falling out; but once packed, there were so many of them that
they could not move. The vessel seemed to start of itself; its
sails swelled out and spread themselves
<!-- Page 148 --><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>like wings,
and away they dashed over the rippling waves, which rose and fell
and hurried them on their way. The ogre's castle was quickly left
far behind, and the tired boys breathed more freely as it
disappeared entirely from their view. In another minute they fell
fast asleep, and did not waken till the motion of the boat ceased,
and they found themselves gliding into a quiet harbor, fringed on
each side with lovely shrubs that dipped their beautiful flowers
into the calm water. Then the lady bade them follow her as she
stepped from the boat on to the soft grass, and led them past
fruits and flowers, and winding walks and fountains, up to the
dazzling crystal palace in which she lived. Here the boys were
halted while she made them this little speech: 'Boys, this is my
home, these are my gardens; for a while you will have to remain
here. We may have trouble with the ogre, but I want you to have no
trouble among yourselves. Kindness, good-humor, pleasant looks and
words, must prevail. There must be no envy, no selfishness, no
desire to get the better of each other in any way. I demand
obedience. If I receive it, all will be well; if I do not, you will
have to suffer the <!-- Page 149 --><a name="Page_149"
id="Page_149"></a>consequence. Now I have said all that I need.
These flowers, these fruits, are yours to enjoy in moderation.'</p>
<p>&quot;As she ceased speaking she clapped her hands, and a troop of
servants appeared. They led the boys to marble baths, where waters
gushed and flowed in liquid beauty, and groves of orange-trees made
a dense thicket about them. Here each boy was made sweet and clean,
and provided with a suit of white clothes. When they emerged from
the baths, they saw before them on the lawn tables filled with
tempting food&mdash;roasted meats, broiled birds, pitchers of milk
and cream, biscuits and jellies and ices.</p>
<p>&quot;The utmost order prevailed. Starved as the poor boys were, the
grace and beauty of their surroundings made them gentle and
patient. At each plate was a tiny nose-gay held in the beak of a
crystal bird, the body of which was a finger-bowl. Every plate was
of exquisite workmanship. Some had birds of gay plumage; some had
fierce tigers' heads or shaggy-maned lions; others bore designs of
tools or curious instruments; but that which most delighted the
boys was a dish of crystal, an exact imitation of the
<i>Swan</i>&mdash;the <i>Fairy Swan</i>&mdash;in
<!-- Page 150 --><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>which they
had sailed to this lovely island. It was laden with choice fruits.
While the boys feasted as they had never before, strains of sweet
music became audible; they could also hear the soft splash of the
waves on the shore, or the dripping of fountains, as the waters
sparkled and fell in their marble basins.</p>
<p>&quot;After they had feasted, the boys wandered off in most
delightful idleness to all parts of the island. They climbed the
trees, which bore blossoms, fruits, and nuts, all at the same time;
they fished in the little coves; they waded in the shallow basins;
and nothing would have marred their happiness had not one tall boy,
with unnaturally strong and keen vision, declared that he saw the
ogre's sail coming in the direction of the island.</p>
<p>&quot;This was terrible, and had the effect of bringing all the boys
together from their various amusements, just as chickens run from a
hovering hawk. Together they crowded for a moment in mute dismay,
unable to speak, to even hide, waiting the approach of their cruel
foe.</p>
<p>&quot;Nearer came the sail, and now they could
<!-- Page 151 --><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>all discern
it. Its great clumsy shape, its heavy lumbering action, were not to
be mistaken.</p>
<p>&quot;What should they do?</p>
<p>&quot;'Run for the Princess,' said one.</p>
<p>&quot;'Too cowardly, that,' said another; and indeed their good,
abundant meal had begun to put strange courage in their little
hearts.</p>
<p>&quot;'Let's meet him, and fight him,' said one.</p>
<p>&quot;'Let's upset his boat,' said another.</p>
<p>&quot;'How?'</p>
<p>&quot;'By pelting him with stones when he comes near enough.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Good!' cried they all; and they began gathering all the bits
of rock and pebbles they could find.</p>
<p>&quot;Now came a roar of ogreish rage from the boat as it neared
them.</p>
<p>&quot;'I'll have ye again!' screamed the ogre.</p>
<p>&quot;Then began the attack&mdash;a volley of small stones, nuts,
fruits, anything they had in their pockets.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the ogre's eyes was closed, so certain had been the aim
of the tall boy who acted as leader.</p>
<p>&quot;but the boat came nearer, and they were very
<!-- Page 152 --><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>much afraid
the ogre would leap from it, when one of the boys whispered, 'I'll
go out to tempt him. Once get him in the water, and he's a goner.
He'll be bewitched.'</p>
<p>&quot;So he off with his jacket, and out he waded, while the others
looked on in breathless admiration.</p>
<p>&quot;The ogre looked with his one eye in eager derision; then
forgetting his danger, and regarding the boy much as he might do an
unwary fish that he would gobble up, he sprang from his boat into
the shallow water, preparing not only to snatch the one boy, but to
seize them all in a great seine he dragged after him, when suddenly
the waves from the centre of the lake began hissing and seething, a
tremendous swell set in towards the shore, driving the brave little
fellow who had gone out to tempt the enemy completely off his legs,
and obliging him to swim to the land, which he had no sooner
reached than a great shout from all the boys made him look back,
when, lo and behold! there was no ogre, only a great shark, with
open jaws and a shining row of teeth, floundering about, and
dashing himself in angry transports against the sides of the ogre
boat, which he vainly attempted <!-- Page 153 --><a name="Page_153"
id="Page_153"></a>to board. And now could be seen swarms of little
fish attacking the great one, darting hither and thither, now at
his head, now at his tail, but keeping well away from his open
jaws. And the waves began to be colored with the shark's blood. At
last, wearied and wounded, with an angry snap of his jaws he dived
down, and was seen no more.</p>
<p>&quot;Then the boys gave another loud huzza, when, like a broad flash
of sunshine, the lovely Princess came among them.</p>
<p>&quot;'Boys,' said she, 'you have proved yourselves brave youngsters.
The ogre can never again trouble you. He will be a shark for three
thousand years, and he will not care to stay in these waters, with
so many enemies about him. Now, when you have regained your good
looks and strength, I will take you all home. Here is the key to my
sweetmeat closet. Run off, now, and have a good time.'</p>
<p>&quot;The sweetmeat closet was a large enclosure where grew
sugar-almond trees, candied pears, candied plums, and where even
the bark and twigs of trees and bushes were of chocolate. In the
centre was a pond of quivering jelly. Mounds and pyramids of
jumbles and iced <!-- Page 154 --><a name="Page_154"
id="Page_154"></a>cakes abounded. They were too tempting to be long
looked at without tasting, and the boys helped themselves
gladly.</p>
<p>&quot;A long, sweet strain from a bugle called them away from this
delightful spot, and on a broad, smooth field they found bats and
balls, tenpins and velocipedes&mdash;in short, everything a boy
could want to play with.</p>
<p>&quot;After this they supped in simple fashion, each boy with only a
great bowl of bread and milk. Then to more music they were marched
to their beds&mdash;downy white nests, in a great room arched with
glass, through which they could see the moon and stars shining, and
where the dawn could awaken them with its early light.</p>
<p>&quot;Such was their life for two of the most happy weeks of their
lives, and never did boys thrive better. They grew fat and rosy;
they sang, they danced, they played. Every time the Princess came
among them they shouted with glee, and nearly cracked their young
throats in doing her honor. But all fine things come to an end some
time. Once more they were packed in the <i>Fairy Swan</i>, and away
they sailed for the land of reality and for home. The Princess gave
them each a beautiful portrait of herself, of the
<!-- Page 155 --><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>island, and
of the <i>Swan</i>. And each boy promised that whenever he had a
chance to perform a kind action he would do it in remembrance of
the gentle courtesy of the Princess. And so ends my fairy story.
Good-night, Phil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-night. Oh, how nice it was! I thank you so much!&quot; and
sleepy Phil turned to see the little white butterfly wings skimming
out of the window, while a long, sweet sigh came from his wind
harp, sounding like, &quot;Good-night&mdash;good-night,&quot; again.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VII</h4>
<h5>FAREWELL TO THE CITY</h5>
<p>A day or two later, Phil, wrapped in shawls, was carried by Joe
to a carriage, and the carriage rolled away to a wharf where puffed
numerous steamboats; and here he was taken on board one of the
river-steamers, and safely placed in the midst of a heap of pillows
on deck, where he could see all the busy life about him&mdash;see
the newspaper boys and the orange women, and the hurrying hacks and
the great teams, and all the stir and tumult of the
<!-- Page 156 --><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>city's
busiest hours. Miss Schuyler, in her cool gray suit, was on one
side of him, and Lisa, looking tranquil and thoroughly glad and
grateful, on the other, and Joe, just the happiest darkey in the
world, sat at his feet, ready to take charge of all and
everything.</p>
<p>They sailed and they sailed, away from the city and its many
roofs, from the factory chimneys and the steeples, from the cloud
of smoke which hung between the sky and house-tops, until they came
to the hills and dales of pasture-lands and villages. Then they
landed, and were whirled away in the cars, and Phil enjoyed it all,
even the fatigue which made him sleep; and Joe carried him about as
if he were a baby.</p>
<p>It was quite dark when, after a drive over a rather rough road,
they reached the lake-side cottage which was Miss Schuyler's summer
home, and Phil was glad to be put in bed, for the old pain had
begun again.</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes the next morning, it was with a strange
feeling of wonder at his new surroundings. Birds were twittering
out-of-doors, and there was a soft lapping of water on the shore.
The green boughs of a cherry <!-- Page 157 --><a name="Page_157"
id="Page_157"></a>tree almost brushed against the window-panes. He
was no longer in his old garret room, but in a pretty apartment,
with bunches of rosebuds on the walls, and scent-bottles on the
toilet-table, and muslin curtains, and a bright carpet, and pretty
book-shelves, and brackets, and lovely child-faces in the
engravings; and on a broad table was a little easel, and a
paint-box, and drawing-paper; and here too was his old box with the
violin strings.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Phil, softly, &quot;I wonder if heaven is any better than
this!&quot;</p>
<p>He had closed his eyes as he said it, and went over his usual
morning prayer of thankfulness; and when he opened his eyes, there
was Lisa with his breakfast-tray&mdash;poached eggs and toast, and
a goblet of milk.</p>
<p>&quot;Lisa, Lisa, is not this too nice for anything?&quot; asked Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, indeed, dear, it is nice. Miss Schuyler says you must
hurry and get strong, so that you can make the acquaintance of the
hens that laid these eggs for you, and the cow whose milk is to do
you so much good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is the cow's name, Lisa?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Lisa.</p>
<p><!-- Page 158 --><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>&quot;It is
Daisy,&quot; said Miss Schuyler, coming in to say good-morning. &quot;She's a
lovely little Alderney, and her milk is like cream. Oh, you will
soon be strong enough to row my boat for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A boat! Have you a boat?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and you are going out on the lake in her this very
morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is just too much happiness, Miss Schuyler.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we will not overpower you. For a day or two you must
rest, and do nothing but breathe the sweet air. I have to be busy
getting things in order and looking after my garden. Lisa will take
her work on the piazza, and you can lie in one of the easy-chairs.
Joe is to wait on you, and do a little weeding, and keep the paths
in order, and bail out the boat; and the old man seems to be very
much at home already. So that is the order of the day. Now
good-bye, and don't do too much thinking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One moment, Miss Schuyler; do you believe in fairies?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just a little,&quot; said Miss Schuyler, with a quizzical smile.</p>
<p><!-- Page 159 --><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>&quot;Well, I
believe in them,&quot; said Phil, &quot;And I think you are one of the best
of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no, I am very human, dear Phil, as you will find out. And
now I must go look after my strawberry-beds. Good-bye.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Phil, waving her a kiss. &quot;Only think, Lisa, we
will actually see strawberries growing! It is quite fairy-land for
me.&quot;</p>
<p>After that he was carried down to the easy-chair on the piazza,
where he could see the lawn sloping down to the lake, and watch the
birds lighting on the rim of a vase full of daisies and running
vines. He could see that the cottage was low and broad, and painted
in two shades of brown; and that there were arbors covered with
grape-vines on one side, and on the other he knew there were
flower-beds and fruit-trees, for every once in a while Miss Rachel
was to be seen emerging from there in a broad straw hat and with
buck-skin gloves, trailing long bits of string or boughs of green
stuff, with scissors and trowel and watering-can.</p>
<p>Lisa had her work-basket, and with deft fingers and a little
undertone of psalmody was fashioning a pretty summer garment. Then
<!-- Page 160 --><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>Miss Rachel
came and tossed a basketful of early roses and syringa down beside
Phil, and put a little table beside him, with some slender glass
vases and a pitcher of water, and asked him to arrange the flowers
for her. This he was glad to do, and made the bunches up as
prettily as his nice taste suggested. But he was really wearied
with great happiness. It was all so new, so charming, every sense
was so satisfied, that at last he closed his eyes and slept.</p>
<p>It seemed to him only a little while, but when he opened his
eyes again Lisa was beside him with his dinner; and after dinner he
slept again, and when he awakened the lawn was in shadow, and the
sun low in the sky, and the birds were twittering and seeking their
nests, and Miss Rachel was telling Joe to put cushions in the boat,
the <i>Flyaway</i>; and presently Phil found himself floating
gently on the lovely water of the lake, and the cottage and lawn
and arbors were looking like a pretty bit of landscape he had seen
in books.</p>
<p>He dipped his fingers in the clear water, and looked down at the
pebbly bottom, and listened to the even dip of the oars, as old Joe
rowed farther out from shore.</p>
<p><!-- Page 161 --><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>&quot;It must
be fairy-land,&quot; thought Phil, but he said nothing; he was too happy
to talk. And so the day ended&mdash;the first day in the
country.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VIII</h4>
<h5>THE NEW COMPANION</h5>
<p>Miss Schuyler was a very active, industrious lady, and her time
was fully occupied. She had her house and grounds to attend to, her
business affairs, her domestic duties, and her poor
people&mdash;for paradise or fairy-land, whichever Phil chose to
call his present abode, was not without its poor&mdash;and so,
during the day, Lisa was mostly with Phil; but he and Miss Rachel
had always a pleasant chat after breakfast; and in the evening many
a long talk made known to Miss Rachel more of Phil's character than
he had any idea of; and the more she knew of the boy, the warmer
her heart became towards him, and the more thankful she was that
she had been able to do for him just what was wanted, and just at
the right time.</p>
<p>Already there was a little color in his pale
<!-- Page 162 --><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>cheeks, and
an eagerness for his meals. He could endure more fatigue, and he
suffered less pain. Indeed, Dr. Smith, who lived half a mile off,
had promised to send his son, a lad of twelve, down to see Phil in
his stead. "For,&quot; said he, "Graham does not know one bone from
another, and will soon help Phil to forget all about his, or
whether they ache or not.&quot;</p>
<p>And so Graham Smith, a ruddy-cheeked fellow, full of life and
spirit, came to see Phil.</p>
<p>It was a warm June day when they first saw each other.</p>
<p>Phil was sketching, and Lisa was sitting beside him sewing. Joe
was Phil's model, standing patiently by the hour to be made into
studies of heads, arms, trunk, or the whole man.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a loud bark of welcome from Nep, the
Newfoundland dog&mdash;who greeted tramps with growls&mdash;and
Graham Smith came up the garden path, followed by Nep, leaping
frantically upon and about him.</p>
<p>He nodded in a brusque way to Lisa and Phil, and without a word
bent down over the sketch, gave a long, low whistle, and said,
&quot;Isn't that bully?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I knew what bully meant, I could answer
<!-- Page 163 --><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>you,
perhaps,&quot; replied Phil, gazing up with admiration at the brown and
red cheeks, the clear blue eyes, and the tough, hardy-looking frame
of his new acquaintance.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure I can tell you; only you can beat all the boys I
know at this sort of work,&quot; said Graham. &quot;Where did you learn how
to do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I have not learned yet; I am only just beginning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haven't you had any lessons?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; it comes naturally to me to draw. I wish I could do it
better, that's all,&quot; said Phil, with a little sigh.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't want to do any better than that,&quot; said Graham.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, you would,&quot; replied Phil, very much pleased, however,
with such heartfelt admiration of his drawing.</p>
<p>Just then Nep made another leap upon Graham, and the two, after
a friendly tussle, had a race down to the lake, where Graham tossed
a stick, and sent the dog after it.</p>
<p>&quot;That is something <i>I</i> cannot do,&quot; said Phil, as the boy
came up to him again; &quot;And yet you do it as easily as I draw.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 164 --><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>&quot;What&mdash;shy
that stick off on the water? Then you don't play ball?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't even walk,&quot; said Phil.</p>
<p>Graham seemed both astonished and sorry, so he turned it off
with, &quot;but you are going to, you know, when you get well&mdash;and
you can do more than any of us now. Let's go out on the water. May
we?&quot; he asked, turning to Lisa.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Lisa; and Joe was glad to get the <i>Flyaway</i>
ready for a start.</p>
<p>Phil was placed in the stern, where Graham promised to show him
how to steer. Phil was an apt scholar, and delighted to be of use.
Joe addressed Graham as &quot;Captain,&quot; and complimented him on the fine
feathering of his oar. The lad was a good oarsman, and made the
boat respond to her name.</p>
<p>&quot;Where shall we go, mate?&quot; asked Graham of Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;The Captain must give orders,&quot; was Phil's reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you been down to Point of Rocks?&quot; asked Graham, directing
Phil's eyes to a distant promontory.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I have not been so far yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are lots of water-lilies there.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 165 --><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>&quot;Oh, do go
there, then! I want some to copy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right. Pull on your starboard oar, Joe; there, that will
do. Now we will soon reach it.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a lovely little nook where grew the lilies, after they
had turned around the jutting stones which gave a name to the spot,
and Phil soon had his hands full of fragrant buds. The water was so
clear that he could see their long green stems away down to the
black mud from which they sprang. They moored the boat, and Graham
got out to ramble, returning with ferns and mosses and wild-flowers
for Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said he, &quot;If you don't mind, I'm going to have a swim
just around the rocks here where the water is deeper and not so
full of weeds. I wish you could come.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So do I,&quot; said Phil, watching with admiration every movement of
his lively companion. Besides admiration, too, there was a twinge
of envy, which he really did not know to be that hateful fault; but
it passed in a moment, and he laughed loudly to see Graham's antics
in the water.</p>
<p>The bath over, they turned homeward. Miss Rachel was
entertaining guests in the parlor.
<!-- Page 166 --><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>Lisa had gone
off for a walk. Graham had to go home, but promised frequent
visits; and as Phil was tired, Joe carried him up and laid him on
his bed, putting his mosses on the table, and the water-lilies in
an oblong vase which was usually filled with fragrant flowers. The
wind harp was there, too, and as Phil, with closed eyes, was
resting in the half-twilight made by shut blinds, there came from
it a little murmur, which grew into a long, sad monotone. He dared
not move, and would not speak, but between his eyelids, partly
raised, he thought he saw the familiar little winged creature who
had comforted and entertained him in his wretched city home.</p>
<p>&quot;How little people know what they are doing when they pull up
ferns and mosses in the woods!&quot; said the soft voice. &quot;I was
sleeping soundly on the nicest bed imaginable, having travelled far
for just a whiff of water-lily odor that I thought might refresh a
poor little hospital patient tossing with fever in the city, when
with a violent wrench I found myself borne off from my sheltered
and dusky resting-place, and tossed into a boat in the blinding
glare of the <!-- Page 167 --><a name="Page_167"
id="Page_167"></a>sun. Fortunately, I had wrapped myself in some
broad grape-vine leaves, and was mistaken for a moth cocoon; else,
dear Phil, I had not been here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am so glad, so very glad, to see you again!&quot; murmured Phil,
softly.</p>
<p>&quot;And I am so glad you are in the country! You could not have
lived long in the city. What are you doing now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Getting well, they tell me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you ever think of the ones who cannot do that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I do not,&quot; said Phil, in some surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, there are so many. I see them often&mdash;little creatures
who are friendless and helpless. You should not forget them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is not that I forget, I do not think of them at all. I
suppose I would if I saw them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you must think of them, and do something for them. Oh
yes, I know you do not believe you can, but the way will come if
you try. All that I do is to whisper soft songs in their ears, or
give them a little waft of summer freshness, but it sometimes stops
their painful tossing, and brings sleep to their tired eyes.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 168 --><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>&quot;I will
think; I will try,&quot; said Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;That is right,&quot; replied the fairy. &quot;Now I will call some of my
friends, the flower fairies, hidden in these water-lilies, and you
shall see them dance.&quot; She clapped her hands softly together, and
out of each lily crept a tiny shape of radiant whiteness and
lily-like grace, so pure, so exquisite, that they did indeed seem
to be the very essence and spirit of the flower. And now began
another of those fantastic movements which Phil had before
witnessed. Now in wreaths, now apart, and again in couples, they
swayed about in an ecstasy of mirth, and the wind harp gave out
strains of wild and melodious sound. They nodded to each other in
their glee, and Phil could hardly tell whether they really were
fairies or flowers, for they looked just as the flowers might when
blown about in a breeze. As he gazed, his eyelids began to droop.
He was very tired. The music grew fainter and fainter. He seemed to
be again in the boat, listening to the water lapping its sides, and
Graham seemed to be with him, reaching out for lilies; and then all
faded, and Phil was fast asleep.</p>

IX</h4>
<h5>A VISIT FROM THE YOUNG DOCTOR</h5>
<p>&quot;Now, Phil,&quot; said Miss Rachel, &quot;I am not going to be so busy for
a while, and though you cannot study yet, for the doctors say you
must not, I shall read aloud to you a little every day. Graham has
promised to come often to visit you, and with our boating and
driving, and pleasant friends coming to stay with us, I think we
shall have rather a nice summer. What do you think?&quot;</p>
<p>Phil's face lighted up with a grateful smile, which grew into
rather a sober expression.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is all delightful; but&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what, my dear; are you not contented?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, more than that: I am as happy as I can be;
but&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Another but.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Rachel, what becomes of all the poor sick children in the
city who have no such friend as you are to me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They suffer sadly, dear Phil.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 170 --><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>&quot;Then
don't you think I ought to remember them sometimes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, in your prayers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is there no other way?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not sure that there is for a child like you. Perhaps there
may be, and we will think about it; but you must not let such a
thought oppress you; it is too much for a sick child to consider.
Be happy; try to get well; do all you can to make everybody about
you glad that you are here, by pleasant looks and good-nature.
There, that is a little sermon which you hardly need, dear, for you
are blessed with a sweet and patient temper, and are far less
troublesome than many a well child.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose I do not deserve any praise if I was made so,&quot; said
Phil, laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;No, not a bit; the poor cross little things who fret and tease
and worry are the ones who should be praised when they make an
effort not to be disagreeable. But I am not going to preach any
more. I am going down-stairs to make some sponge-cake for the
picnic you and Lisa and I are going to have to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A picnic! a real one in the woods?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and here comes Graham with a basket.
<!-- Page 171 --><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>I wonder what
is in it. Good-bye. I will send him up to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Graham came up in a few moments with the basket on his arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Guess what I have here, Phil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can I?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, you can&mdash;just guess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something to eat?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, little piggy; or rather yes, if you choose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, chickens or eggs?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, neither.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fruit?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Guess again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Medicine for some of your father's sick people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Flowers? Oh no, one cannot eat flowers if they choose. I give
it up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, watch,&quot; and lifting the cover slowly, three cunning
white rabbits poked their little twitching noses over the edge of
the basket.</p>
<p>Phil gazed at them delightedly. &quot;And you call those little
darlings something to eat, do you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you choose, yes.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 172 --><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>&quot;As if any
one could choose to be such a cannibal! What precious little
beauties they are! Oh, how pretty they look!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really! Oh, thank you, Graham. But you must ask Miss
Schuyler.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did, and I am to build them a hutch. Until I do, there is an
empty box in the barn where they can stay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you can build&mdash;handle tools like a carpenter? How nice
that must be!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that's nothing; all boys can do that.&quot;</p>
<p>Graham forgot that Phil was one boy who could not, but seeing
the shade come over his friend's face made him repent his hasty
speech.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; he said, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&quot;No, you need not, Graham. I must get used to being different
from other boys. Well, these are just the loveliest little things I
ever saw. What do they live on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Almost any green thing; they are very fond of lettuce. When you
are able you must come and see my lop-ears.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you many rabbits?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, quite a number. Let me see: there's
<!-- Page 173 --><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>Neb (he's an
old black fellow&mdash;Nebuchadnezzar), and Miss Snowflake, Aunt
Chloe (after the one in <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>), Fanny Elssler
(because she jumps about so), and Mr. Prim&mdash;- he is the
stillest old codger you ever saw.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What other pets have you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've lots of chickens, three dogs, two cats, a squirrel, and a
parrot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A large family.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, almost too large; they will have to be given up soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How soon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the fall, I suppose; I am going to boarding-school.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What fun!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You would be amused with Polly. She is a gay old
thing&mdash;laughs, sings, and dances.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Graham, can she do all that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed she can; sometimes she sings like a nurse putting a
child to sleep, in a sort of humming hush-a-by-baby way; then she
tries dance-music, and hops first on one foot, then on the
other&mdash;this way,&quot; and Graham began mimicking the parrot, and
Phil laughed till the tears came.</p>
<p><!-- Page 174 --><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>&quot;She
screams out 'Fire!' like an old fury, but she is as serene as a May
day when she gets her cup of coffee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that your parrot, Graham?&quot; asked Miss Schuyler.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, ma'am, that's our green-and-golden Polly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to pay it a visit. Can you join our picnic
to-morrow? it is Phil's first one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really! why, he has a good deal to learn of our country
ways.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and I have a little plan to propose in which you may help
us. Promise you will come.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I am always ready, thank you, Miss Schuyler. Shall we go by
boat?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To be sure, to Eagle Island.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then we will go early, I suppose, as it is quite a long pull.
What must I bring, Miss Schuyler?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only your arms, Graham, for alone Joe will perhaps find the
rowing a little too much in the warm sun. I am Commissary-General
for the party. That means, Phil, that I furnish the provisions: a
Commissary-General has to see that his troops are well fed.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 175 --><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>&quot;There is
no danger about that, I am sure,&quot; said Graham, gallantly, &quot;If Miss
Schuyler leads us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, to-morrow at nine, before the sun is too
high&mdash;earlier would not do for Phil. And now be off with
yourself: and your bunnies, Graham, leave them in the barn; and
tell your good, kind father that you are an excellent substitute
for himself, that Phil is improving even faster with your visits
than he did with his.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-bye, then, Phil; good-bye, Miss Schuyler. To-morrow at
nine.&quot;</p>

<h4>CHAPTER X</h4>
<h5>THE PICNIC</h5>
<p>It was a perfect morning. Blue sky, with pure little snow-drop
clouds, as if the angels had dropped them from their baskets as
they tended the flowers in the heavenly gardens. The lake sparkled
and glistened in the sunshine, and every wave seemed to leap
joyously as it broke in soft foam on the shore. In one end of the
<i>Flyaway</i> sat Phil, on a pile of shawls; in the other were
stowed a large basket, a pail of
<!-- Page 176 --><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>ice, and a
pail of milk, and in between were Miss Rachel, Lisa, Joe, and
Graham. Phil had twisted up a little nosegay for each, and had
pinned a broad wreath of grape-leaves around Joe's straw hat,
making the old fellow laugh at his nonsense. They were just pushing
off, when a sudden rattling of chain and some impatient barks from
Nep showed that he began to feel neglected.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought we could get away unnoticed,&quot; said Miss Rachel, &quot;but
I find myself mistaken.&quot;</p>
<p>The boys pleaded for Nep. &quot;Ah, let him come, please let him
come.&quot;</p>
<p>Nep's leaps becoming frantic, Miss Rachel yielded, and Graham
soon had him loosened. He jumped at once into the boat, and crept
under Phil's feet, making a nice warm mat.</p>
<p>&quot;Poor Nep,&quot; said Phil, patting him, "he felt neglected"; and the
big tail wagged thankful thumps against the boat.</p>
<p>The morning air was sweet with all manner of herbage yet fresh
from the morning dew. The trees were in their most brilliant green,
and every leaf seemed newly washed.</p>
<p>Graham began a boating song, and Miss Schuyler joined in the
chorus. Old Joe <!-- Page 177 --><a name="Page_177"
id="Page_177"></a>chuckled and grinned; even quiet Lisa hummed a
little as the song rose louder; and Phil, dipping his hands in the
clear water, imagined that the fishes were frisking a waltz in
their honor. They glided past Point of Rocks, past huge beds of
water-lilies, past lovely little coves and inlets, and spots where
Graham said there was excellent fishing; finally Eagle Island
became more distinct, and its pine-trees began to look
imposing.</p>
<p>&quot;Here we are!&quot; said Graham at last, bringing the <i>Flyaway</i>
up nicely on a pebbly beach, in good boating style.</p>
<p>Graham and Joe made a chair with their hands and arms, and so
carried Phil very comfortably to the place under the trees which
Miss Rachel had chosen for their encampment.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Miss Rachel, as she brought out Phil's portfolio, a
book, her own embroidery, and Lisa's sewing, &quot;I propose that
Graham, being a more active member of society than we are, go off
with Joe and catch some fish for our dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just the thing!&quot; said Graham; &quot;but I did not bring a line.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 178 --><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>&quot;Joe has
everything necessary&mdash;bait and all,&quot; said Miss Schuyler.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Miss Rachel, when the fishermen had gone, seeing
Phil's longing look, and knowing well how much he would have liked
to go with them, &quot;We must go to work too, so that we may enjoy our
play all the more afterwards. I could not let you go with Graham,
my dear Phil; it would have fatigued you too much; but I want you
to try and draw me that drooping bush on the edge of the water, and
while you draw I will read aloud for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Schuyler read, explained, talked to Phil about his drawing,
and gave him the names of the trees about him.</p>
<p>The time flew fast, and it seemed a very little while when Miss
Schuyler said to Lisa, &quot;I think I hear oars; we had better be
getting our feast ready.&quot;</p>
<p>They brought out the basket and pails, spread a nice red dessert
cloth down on a smooth patch of grass, laid broad green leaves down
for the rolls and biscuits; golden balls of butter were in a silver
dish of their own, and so were the berries in a willow basket,
around which they put a few late wild-flowers.</p>
<p><!-- Page 179 --><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>&quot;Now we
want a good flat stone for our fireplace, and&mdash;Ah! here come
our fishermen just in time.&quot;</p>
<p>Graham and Joe now appeared with a few perch, but plenty of
catfish. They went to work with zeal, and soon had enough brush for
the fire, which they built at a good distance. And while Graham fed
it, Joe skinned his catfish, salted the perch, and laid them on the
stone.</p>
<p>Then they all sat around their grassy table, and Joe served them
in fine style, bringing them their fish smoking hot on white
napkins.</p>
<p>How merry they were over the good things, and how eager Graham
was to cook fish for Joe, and serve the old fellow as nicely as he
had done all of them! And Phil cut the very largest slice of cake
for Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;It is just the jolliest picnic I ever was at,&quot; said Graham,
helping to wash and clear away, and re-stow spoons and forks.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it is,&quot; said Phil. &quot;There never can be another quite
so nice: it is my first one, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; just think of it, and it's my fiftieth, I
<!-- Page 180 --><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>suppose; but
then you must not think all picnics like this. It is something
really remarkable to have everything go off so smoothly. Why,
sometimes all the crockery gets smashed, or the fire won't burn, or
if it does, you get the smoke in your eyes, or your potatoes get
burned, and your lemonade gets in your milk, or somebody puts your
ice in the sun, and, to crown it all, down comes a shower.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear, dear, what a chapter of accidents, Graham!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you listening, Miss Rachel?&quot; said Graham, with a quizzical
look. &quot;I was only letting Phil know how much better you manage than
most people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, when you and Phil are ready, I want to tell you about
something else I should like to manage. Come, put away all the
books and work, and listen to my preaching.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Rachel sat on a fallen tree, leaning against some young
birches. &quot;Phil was asking me, yesterday,&quot; said she, &quot;What becomes
of all the poor sick children in the city, and he seemed to think
he ought in some way to help them; so I promised to think about
what he had <!-- Page 181 --><a name="Page_181"
id="Page_181"></a>been considering, and a little plan came into my
head in which I thought you could help us, Graham.&quot;</p>
<p>Graham looked up with a pleased face, and nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;It is just this. In the city hospitals are many sick children
who have to stay in bed almost all the time. Now Phil and I want to
do the little that we can for them, and it seems to me it would be
nice to send fresh flowers and fruit&mdash;all that we can spare
from our gardens&mdash;once or twice a week to some of these sick
city children. What do you think, boys?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would be lovely, Miss Schuyler,&quot; said Phil, &quot;only I do not
see how <i>we</i> could help; it would all come from you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not all, dear child. I mean to give you both a share of the
work&mdash;you in your way, and Graham in his. Are you interested?
Shall I go on and tell you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; both exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;I propose that we set aside a certain part of our flower-garden
and our fruit-trees, you and I, Graham (for I know you have a
garden of your own), which we will call our 'hospital
<!-- Page 182 --><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>fruits and
flowers,' and Phil is to assist in making up boquets, hulling
berries, and packing to send away; besides that, he is to make some
little pictures, just little bits of sketches of anything that he
fancies&mdash;a spray of buds, a single pansy, Joe's old hat and
good-natured face beneath, a fish, or a bit of vine-covered
fence&mdash;and we will sell them for him, and the money shall help
pay the express charges upon our gifts to the sick children, so
that Phil will really be doing more than any of us. How do you like
my plan?&quot;</p>
<p>The boys were pleased, and had begun to say so, when a shout
came from the other part of the island from Joe, and Nep set up a
violent barking.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi! look up dar, Miss Schuyler!&quot; called out Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Quick, Phil!&quot; said Graham; &quot;look! there's an eagle. How
fortunate we are! There he goes, sailing away in all his glory&quot;;
and sure enough, the great bird floated farther and farther up in
the blue sky.</p>
<p>Still Nep kept on barking, and Graham ran down to see what was
the matter. He came back with something dangling from his hand, Joe
and Nep following.</p>
<p><a name="eagle" id="eagle"></a>

<!-- Page 185 --><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>&quot;A black
snake&mdash;oh, what a dreadful creature!&quot; exclaimed Lisa.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, indeed, ma'am,&quot; said Joe; &quot;And if Nep hadn't barked so,
the drefful cretur would have bitten me sure. That dog knows a
heap; you'd better allus take him with you in the woods, Miss
Rachel. I was lyin' off sound asleep, with this critter close
beside me, when Nep come up, and barked just as plain as speakin'.
'Take care,' says he, 'ole Joe, you're in danger,' an' with that I
woke in a hurry, an' jist then I saw that big eagle come soarin'
overhead, and then Marsa Graham come and give that snake his
death-blow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you do it, Graham?&quot; asked Phil, excitedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I pounded him on the head with a stone as he was making
off. He is a pretty big fellow, and he must have swum from the
main-land, Miss Schuyler.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I never saw a snake on this island before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come here, Nep,&quot; said Phil, &quot;dear old fellow; good dog for
taking care of Joe. Your head shall be my first picture for our
sick children.&quot;</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4><!-- Page 186 --><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>CHAPTER
XI</h4>
<h5>A PAIR OF CRUTCHES</h5>
<p>Aunt Rachel's plan was entered into most heartily by both boys,
and Graham became so much interested as to act as express agent on
his own account, going to the city with what he called his first
load of berries and flowers; but on his return was so silent and
uncommunicative that Phil asked him if anything had gone wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't ask me to tell you what I saw,&quot; said he, in reply; &quot;it
was more than I could stand.&quot; Then, as if sorry for his short
answer, he added, &quot;It was the most pitiful thing in the
world&mdash;such a lot of little pale faces all together! and when
I came to give them their share, as the lady in charge told me to
do, I cried right out like any baby&mdash;there, now! But you have
no idea how they brightened up, and how glad they looked when they
took the posies. I don't want to go again, though, unless Miss
Rachel asks me to. I shall see those poor wizened little things as
long as I live. I am going to sell all
<!-- Page 187 --><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>my pets this
fall and give the money to St. Luke's Hospital, and I shall sell
every egg my chickens lay, for the same purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>After that Phil asked no more questions, but worked harder than
ever at his drawings, and as the season advanced, and flowers and
fruit grew more abundant, they were able to despatch a basket twice
a week.</p>
<p>Every day was filled with new life and pleasure. Increasing
strength alone would have been a source of happiness, but in
addition to this Phil had the benefit of Aunt Rachel's
loving-kindness, Lisa's nursing, Joe's good offices, and Graham's
pleasant, friendly attentions. Then he was learning constantly
something new, with eyes and ears, from the book of nature, with
all its wonderful pictures, and from the other books allowed
him.</p>
<p>Driving behind old Slow Coach and floating on the lake in the
<i>Flyaway</i> were some of the delights, and when more visitors
came, and two charming young cousins of Aunt Rachel made the house
resound with melody, Phil thought his happiness complete. But a new
surprise was in store for him when, after repeated consultations
and measurements and whisperings,
<!-- Page 188 --><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>a huge parcel
was brought to his room, and Aunt Rachel and Lisa took off the
wrappings. Neither of them looked particularly joyful as a pair of
stout crutches made their appearance, but their faces changed
wonderfully when Phil gave a cry of glee, and said, hilariously,
&quot;Now I can walk! now I can walk!&quot;</p>
<p>He was eager to use his new helps, but it took a longer time
than he had imagined to get accustomed to them, and it was many
weeks before he could go down the garden paths (followed by Nep
with much gravity, as if Phil were in his especial care) with
desirable ease.</p>
<p>Coming in from one of these rather tiresome attempts one warm
morning, and hearing music and voices in the parlor, Phil strayed
into the dining-room, which was darkened and cool, and fragrant
with fresh flowers. He lay down on a lounge, with his crutches
beside him, and was listening to the pretty waltz being played in
the other room, when he thought he saw a tiny creature light upon
one of his crutches. Supposing it, however, to be a butterfly, he
watched it in a sleepy, dreamy fashion, until it approached more
nearly, and these words startled him:</p>
<p><!-- Page 189 --><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>&quot;You do
not know me?&quot; said a tiny voice, rather reproachfully.</p>
<p>&quot;What! is it you, my dear little wind fairy?&quot; he asked. &quot;I never
dreamed that I should see you again. How did you get here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blown here, to be sure, as I always am, only I have to pilot
myself, or what would be the use of having wings? I came on some
thistle-down this time, for I wanted to have another peep at you,
and I have had hard work to follow you in here, I assure you; but
the vibrations of that lovely music helped me, and here I am. Do
not talk&mdash;let me do it all. I never have much time, you know,
and I want to thank you for your goodness in taking my advice, and
helping some of my little sick friends. You do not begin to know
what good you have done&mdash;nobody does; but doing good is very
like the big snowballs that children make in winter&mdash;a little
ball at first, but as they roll, it grows bigger and bigger, almost
of itself, until it is more than one can manage. So it has been
with your kind action: many have imitated it, and flowers come now
to the hospitals by the bushel. Not only children, but grown
people, sad with suffering, <!-- Page 190 --><a name="Page_190"
id="Page_190"></a>have been cheered and benefited. And you too are
growing strong: how glad I am to see it! Your cheeks are tinged
with just a delicate bloom, and you have grown taller. Ah, the
country is the place for you children! I saw one of your sketches
in the hospital the other day, hung under a little cross made of
moss; it was a water-lily, and out of it was stepping some one who
looked like me. The child who owned it said it came to her tied to
some roses. She did not know I heard her; she was telling a
visitor, and she said it made her happy every time she looked at
it. That was a pretty thought of yours. This is my last visit for a
long while. I am to be sent off to fan her Royal Highness, the
Queen of Kind Wishes, when her coronation takes place. She lives in
her palace of Heart's Ease, in a far-away island. I am to sail part
of the way in a nautilus&mdash;one of those lovely shells you have
seen, I dare say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Phil, &quot;I never saw one. And so you are going
away&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never saw a nautilus!&quot; interrupted the fairy, as if afraid Phil
was going to be doleful over her departure. &quot;It looks like a ship,
for all the world, and it <i>is</i> a ship for me, but it would not
<!-- Page 191 --><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>hold
you&mdash;oh no! not such a gigantic creature as a boy&quot;; and the
fairy laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me,&quot; said Phil; &quot;No more visits, no more fairy stories.
What will I do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shall I tell you just one more story before I say
good-bye?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, shut your eyes and listen.&quot;</p>
<p>Phil obeyed, and the fairy began:</p>
<p>&quot;In the days when fairies had much more power than they now
have, there lived in a little house on the edge of a wood haunted
by elves and brownies a boy named Arthur. He was a bright, handsome
lad, but a little lazy, and much more fond of pleasure than of
work; and he had a way of flinging himself down in the woods to
lounge and sleep when his mother at home was waiting for him to
come back with a message, or to do some little promised task. Now
the fairies knew this, and it displeased them; for they are as busy
as bees, and do not like idleness. Besides, as one bad habit leads
to another, Arthur, in his lounging ways, would often do great
damage to the fairies' flower-beds, switching off the heads of
wild-flowers in the most <!-- Page 192 --><a name="Page_192"
id="Page_192"></a>ruthless fashion, and even pulling them up by the
roots when he felt like it.</p>
<p>&quot;One day he had been indulging this whim without any motive,
hardly even thinking what he was doing, when he began to feel very
strangely: a slight chill made him shiver; his eyes felt as if they
were coming out of his head, his legs as if they were getting
smaller and smaller; he had an irresistible desire to hop, and he
was very thirsty. There was a rivulet near, and instead of walking
to it he leaped, and stooping to drink, he saw himself reflected in
its smooth surface. No longer did he see Arthur; no longer was he a
mortal boy. Instead of this, a frog&mdash;a green speckled frog,
with great bulging eyes and a fishy mouth&mdash;looked up at him.
He tried to call, to shout, but in vain; he could only croak, and
this in the most dismal manner. What was he to do? Sit and stare
about him, try to catch flies, plunge down into the
mud&mdash;charming amusements for the rest of his life! A little
brown bird hopped down for a drink from the rivulet; she stooped
and rose, stooped and rose, again and again.</p>
<p>&quot;A great green tear rolled down from the
<!-- Page 193 --><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>frog's
bulging eye, and splashed beside the bird's drinking-place. She
looked up in alarm, and said, in the sweetest voice imaginable,
'Can I do anything to assist you?'</p>
<p>&quot;'I am sure I don't know,' croaked Arthur, hoarse as if he had
been born with a sore throat.</p>
<p>&quot;'But what <i>is</i> the matter?' persisted the little brown
bird, as more green tears splashed beside her.</p>
<p>&quot;'The matter is that I am a frog, I suppose,' said Arthur,
rather rudely.</p>
<p>&quot;'Well, what of that?' still said the little bird. 'Frogs are
very respectable.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Are they, indeed; then I'd rather not be respectable,' said
Arthur.</p>
<p>&quot;'You shock me,' said the bird.</p>
<p>&quot;'I don't wonder; it has been a great shock to me,' responded
Arthur.</p>
<p>&quot;'What has?' said the bird.</p>
<p>&quot;'Being a frog,' replied Arthur.</p>
<p>&quot;'Have you not always? Oh no; I presume you were once a tadpole;
all frogs are at first.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Indeed I never was a tadpole,' said Arthur, indignantly; and
then, it seeming somewhat a funny idea to him, he began to laugh in
the hoarsest, croakiest <i>kerthumps</i>, which brought
<!-- Page 194 --><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>him to his
senses again. Then he added, to the little brown bird which
fluttered about him in some agitation, 'No, I never was a
tadpole&mdash;I was a boy named Arthur a few moments ago.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Aha!' twittered the little brown bird, 'I see now: you have
been bewitched.'</p>
<p>&quot;'I suppose so,' said Arthur, 'and I would gladly be bewitched
into a boy again, if that would do any good.'</p>
<p>&quot;'I must try and see what I can do for you. I am very busy
repairing my nest&mdash;it was injured in the last storm; but I
will go as soon as I can to see one of the herb elves, and find out
what is to be done. You must have displeased them very much.'</p>
<p>&quot;'You are very kind,' replied Arthur, taking no notice of the
latter words.</p>
<p>&quot;'Oh no, not at all; it is a pleasure,' said the little brown
bird.</p>
<p>&quot;'Can I do anything for you?' asked Arthur, roused into
politeness by the pleasant manners of his little friend.</p>
<p>&quot;'You might gather some twigs or moss. Oh no, it would be all
wet, and I should have great bother in drying it,' said the little
house-keeper. 'I am equally obliged, but you had better just
<!-- Page 195 --><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>stay quiet
and keep cool till I return'; and she flew softly away.</p>
<p>&quot;'I can keep cool enough,' repeated Arthur; 'when one's legs are
in the water, it would be pretty hard to do anything else.'</p>
<p>&quot;It seemed dreadfully long to wait, when all he could do was to
wink and yawn and gobble flies, and yet lounging in the woods and
killing flowers had never seemed tedious when he was a boy. He
tried to go to sleep, but was in too great a bewilderment to
quietly close his eyes in slumber, so he gazed at the brook, and
wondered when the little brown bird would reappear.&quot;</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XII</h4>
<h5>THE FAIRY'S STORY CONTINUED</h5>
<p>&quot;Sooner than he had supposed, Arthur heard the soft little
twitter of his new friend.</p>
<p>&quot;'I have flown really quite a distance, and had the good-fortune
to see the elf who has charge of these woods. He is very much vexed
with you, and will not listen to any excuse;
<!-- Page 196 --><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>though
knowing so little about the matter, I hardly knew what to offer. I
pleaded your youth, however, and made bold to promise your good
behavior in the future, and while I was speaking one of the lesser
elves twitched my wing a little, and whispered,</p>
<p>&quot;'&quot;Promise him something he likes as a ransom, and perhaps he
will answer your request.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'&quot;but I do not know what he likes,&quot; I replied. &quot;Can you suggest
anything?&quot; I added, in the same whisper.</p>
<p>&quot;'&quot;He is very much in need of some sea-weed. I heard him say the
other day that he wanted some iodine, and that he would have to
send a party of us off to the sea-shore to get sea-weed, from which
we make iodine. Now, if your friend can get it, he would be so much
pleased that I am sure he would be willing to forgive him, and
restore him to his proper condition.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'After hearing this, I made the offer in your name, and
received a favorable reply. You are to get two pounds of sea-weed
in less than a fortnight. It is to be laid on the large flat rock
which you will see lower down the stream, under the chestnut-tree.
You are to leave it there, <!-- Page 197 --><a name="Page_197"
id="Page_197"></a>and by no means to remain there, but return here,
and your reward will await you.'</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur thanked the little bird warmly, but inwardly despaired
of accomplishing anything so difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;The little bird hopped restlessly about. 'You will try to do
this, will you not?' she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;'Of course I will try,' said Arthur, rather ashamed, and
striving to put a bold face on the matter. 'I will try, but I do
not know exactly what to do first.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Streams run into rivers, and rivers to the sea,' twittered the
bird.</p>
<p>&quot;'Yes; but I hardly think frogs swim in deep water. I will have
to contrive a boat or a float of some sort.'</p>
<p>&quot;Just then a huge trout sprang up after a fly and missed it.
Quick as a flash the little bird darted up, caught the fly, dropped
it into the trout's open mouth, and twittered something
unintelligible to Arthur. He heard, however, a curious sound of
words from the trout.</p>
<p>&quot;'Jump on my back, jump on my back, and be off, alack!'</p>
<p>&quot;'Go,' said the bird, quickly.</p>
<p><!-- Page 198 --><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>&quot;Arthur
made a bound, and found himself on Mr. Specklesides's back in an
instant.</p>
<p>&quot;'Good-bye,' sang the little bird, loudly, for already the trout
had flashed away into a dark pool beneath a cascade, where the
falling waters made a deafening noise. In another instant he made
another dart, and quick as lightning they were in broad, shallow
water. Again they were whirled from eddy to eddy, and already the
stream had widened into a little river. The bending trees, the
weeds, and grasses, were mirrored in its cool depths, as now with
long, steady stroke the trout swam on.</p>
<p>&quot;Suddenly another shape darkened the glassy surface of the
water. It was the figure of a man in slouched hat and high boots,
and long tapering rod in hand. He seemed to be quite motionless,
but far out near the middle of the stream, just where the trout was
swimming, danced a brilliant fly. A leap, a dash, and then began
such a whirling mad rush through the water that Arthur knew he
would be overthrown. The trout had seized the fly, and the
fisherman, rapidly unreeling his line, waited for the fish to
exhaust himself. Before this was done, however, Arthur was thrown
violently off <!-- Page 199 --><a name="Page_199"
id="Page_199"></a>the trout's back, and by dint of desperate
efforts reached the shore, where for a long while he lay
motionless.</p>
<p>&quot;When he revived he found himself in long sedgy grass, well
shielded from observation. The trout was nowhere to be seen, and
Arthur knew that it was idle to search for him. Poor fellow! his
fate had found him, and no doubt he was lying quietly enough now in
the fisherman's basket.</p>
<p>&quot;'&quot;Streams run into rivers, and rivers to the sea,&quot; and I must
look for some other method than the trout's back.'</p>
<p>&quot;He hopped about wearily, ate a few flies, and then, quite worn
out, fell fast asleep. When he awoke it was dark. Fire-flies
flashed about him brilliantly; stars beamed so brightly that they
seemed double, half above in the sky, and half below in the water.
From some overhanging boughs came a dismal hooting.</p>
<p>&quot;'Hush!' cried Arthur, impatiently. 'Why do you want to spoil
the night with such wailing?'</p>
<p>&quot;'I have lost three lovely little owlets,' was the response.
'Darling little fluffy cherubs! Never had an owl-mother three such
beauties!'</p>
<p><!-- Page 200 --><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>&quot;'Where
are they?' asked Arthur.</p>
<p>&quot;'Devoured by a horrible night-hawk,' sobbed the owl.</p>
<p>&quot;'Where has the night-hawk flown?'</p>
<p>&quot;'Far down the river after prey.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Why do you not go after him and punish him?'</p>
<p>&quot;'It is too far, and I am too sorrowful.'</p>
<p>&quot;'You have no spirit. <i>I</i> would peck his eyes out were I in
your place.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Ah! you are young and strong and brave.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Take me on your back, and we will fly after him.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Come, then, and do battle for me, noble friend.'</p>
<p>&quot;Down flew the owl, and up jumped Arthur quickly on its back,
inwardly wondering how a frog could be a match for a night-hawk,
but quite resolved to aid the poor owl if he could. With a
delightful sense of freedom and glorious liberty, such as he had
never before even imagined, they rose high above the tree-tops.</p>
<p>&quot;The moon had now risen, and the air seemed transparent
silver.</p>
<p>&quot;Keeping near the border of the river, which
<!-- Page 201 --><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>had greatly
widened, they emerged from one forest only to enter another.</p>
<p>&quot;The wild cries of loons saluted them; herds of deer, cooling
themselves in the water, glanced up with startled gaze as they
passed.</p>
<p>&quot;A dark bird flapped low over the water as a fish leaped from
the waves.</p>
<p>&quot;'It is my enemy,' whispered the owl.</p>
<p>&quot;'Pursue him,' returned Arthur.</p>
<p>&quot;'My heart sinks within me; the memory of my owlets subdues all
revengefulness. Though I should make him suffer, it would not
return to me my children.'</p>
<p>&quot;'But if we kill him he can do no further mischief.'</p>
<p>&quot;'True, true; but he is a fearful fellow. What weapons have you
with which to meet him?'</p>
<p>&quot;'None but my eyes and legs; a frog is a poor despicable wretch
under such circumstances. Our weight together might sink him. You
must fly at him with one tremendous blow, get him down in the
water, and all the fish will assist to punish him, for all owe him
a grudge. Or stay: fly close to him, and I will leap upon him; the
weight will surprise and annoy him,
<!-- Page 202 --><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>and you must
then make a dash for his eyes. Pluck them out if you can; it will
be worse than death for him.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Barbaric torture! But the memory of my owlets hardens my
motherly heart; it pulsates with tremendous force; their loss is
the world's loss. I hasten to the combat.'</p>
<p>&quot;They swept down low as the hawk swooped for fish; Arthur sprang
upon its back; the owl darted at the creature's eyes, and with a
furious blow, first at one then at the other, made her enemy
sightless. The hawk, with a cry of pain, fell into the water.
Instantly an enormous fish dragged him beneath, and it was only by
wonderful dexterity on the part of the owl and of the frog that the
latter was unhurt. He nestled once again among the owl's soft
feathers, and they sought the shore.</p>
<p>&quot;'Now how shall I repay you, my brave friend?' asked the owl, as
Arthur leaped upon land.</p>
<p>&quot;'I do not wish for any reward,' replied Arthur.</p>
<p>&quot;'Nevertheless, you will not refuse to grant a sorrowful and
stricken mother the little balm which her grateful spirit seeks in
the return or <!-- Page 203 --><a name="Page_203"
id="Page_203"></a>acknowledgment of so vast a favor as you have
conferred upon me.'</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur thought a moment, and then told the owl of his journey
and errand to the sea-shore. 'Perhaps, as you are so famous for
wisdom, Mother Owl, you may be able to give me some advice which
will assist me to get the sea-weed, and return as speedily as I
can,' he said, as he finished his narration.</p>
<p>&quot;'I will consider,' replied the owl, bending her searching gaze
towards the earth. After a few moments' reflection, in which she
rolled her luminous and cat-like eyes about, ruffled her feathers,
and uttered a few soft 'to-whit to-whoos,' she murmured, 'I have
it. Seldom do I require to deliberate so anxiously, but parental
anguish has clouded my active brain; the recent combat, also, has
exhausted my nervous system. I have the happy thought at last,
though, and you shall be assisted. We will fly to the nest of an
old friend, a celebrated kingfisher. He lives not far from here; he
knows the coast well, and will aid us. Come, mount upon my willing
back, and we will fly at once.'</p>
<p>&quot;This was no sooner said than done. They flew swiftly over the
now broad expanse of <!-- Page 204 --><a name="Page_204"
id="Page_204"></a>water, rolling in a powerful stream, bordered by
a wild and harsh-looking forest. A few tall and leafless trunks in
a cluster contained, high among the bare boughs, a huge nest. From
it, aroused from his sleep, sullenly flapped a large bird.</p>
<p>&quot;'Wait a moment, my friend,' called the owl, in her most
beseeching manner. 'I have a favor to ask. I wish to appeal to your
intelligent geographical, topographical, and comprehensive
intellect for guidance. You know the coast; lead us to it before
the dawn of day.'</p>
<p>&quot;'A most unwarrantable request, upon my word,' was the answer,
in a gruff voice. 'Why should you thus disturb my slumber, and
demand of me this journey in the night?'&quot;</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER XIII</h4>
<h5>THE FAIRY'S STORY CONCLUDED</h5>
<p>&quot;The owl replied softly, telling her errand, praising the
bravery of the frog, and evidently pleasing the kingfisher with the
news of the death of his enemy the night-hawk.</p>
<p>&quot;'I will go,' he answered. 'I do not pretend
<!-- Page 205 --><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>to be
chivalric; I should prefer to sleep; nevertheless, I will go. Rise,
follow-me. I expected to breakfast at home; now we will get some
seafood.'</p>
<p>&quot;'He is always thus,' whispered the owl, as Arthur and she rose
high in the air. 'He is a wonderful naturalist, a student of
ichthyology, has a vast and profound fund of knowledge, but a great
gourmand, always considering what he will eat; but he is reliable;
we may trust him.'</p>
<p>&quot;They sailed now high, now low, over ravines and gulfs, until
the continuous murmur which had accompanied them deepened into the
steady, solemn roar of the ocean. Great crags, broad sands, and
huge waves tossing their white crests now met their eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;The soft faint gray of early dawn lit the heavens. The
kingfisher perched himself on the top of a rock, and watched the
seething waves with a steady and keen outlook. The owl fluttered
down to the long line of breakers, and bade Arthur notice the
immense quantity of sea-weed fringing the rocks in all
directions.</p>
<p>&quot;'Now how to carry it back is the question,' said Arthur, rather
dolorously.</p>
<p><!-- Page 206 --><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>&quot;'My
friend, have no fear,' said the owl. 'Go to work bravely, and
gather all you can, then we will arrange to transport it. Hasten,
however, as much as you can.'</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur hopped about zealously. He was half deafened with the
thunder of the waves, half blinded with the dashing spray, half
drowned with the salt-water pouring from every cliff and cranny of
the rocks. Still he tore and clutched at the sea-weed, dragging it
in masses larger than his own frog body to where the owl waited for
him on the beach, in a sort of grotto hollowed out by the waves.
There they piled it until they both were assured they had the
proper quantity. Then the owl flew to a promontory and hailed the
kingfisher. Arthur, quite worn out, fell asleep. When he awoke, he
found him self most strangely placed.</p>
<p>&quot;So soundly had he slept that the owl and kingfisher, having
completed their arrangements for the removal of the sea-weed, had
removed Arthur also, and he woke to find himself on the back of an
enormous sturgeon, with sea-weed under him, over him, and about
him. Tightly about the sturgeon was bound an old rope, which the
kingfisher had procured from <!-- Page 207 --><a name="Page_207"
id="Page_207"></a><!-- Page 208 --><a name="Page_208"
id="Page_208"></a><!-- Page 209 --><a name="Page_209"
id="Page_209"></a>the remains of a wreck on the rocks, and in which
he had entangled the sturgeon; this rope the owl and kingfisher
took turns in holding, keeping the sturgeon near the surface of the
waves by its check upon his movements, which were very bold and
rapid. Thus, by the double force of flying and swimming, Arthur was
carried with immense speed into the quiet waters of a bay from
which they had emerged on arriving at the ocean.</p>
<p><a name="sturgeon" id="sturgeon"></a></p>
<div class="center">

<b>MAKING THE STURGEON USEFUL</b></div>
<br />
<br />

<p>&quot;From the bay they sailed up into the river, and were coursing
rapidly on to its narrower surface, when the sturgeon suddenly gave
a great leap, very nearly throwing Arthur and his precious load off
his back.</p>
<p>&quot;The owl screamed, the kingfisher shouted hoarsely, but
tightened his hold upon the rope, while the sturgeon dashed madly
on.</p>
<p>&quot;Again he made another frantic leap, whereupon the kingfisher
gave him a thrust with his beak, to which the sturgeon replied,</p>
<p>&quot;'The current is becoming too shallow; I can go no farther. I
<i>must</i> have air. How can you expect me to go up this trout
stream? have you no mercy for such a beast of burden as you have
made me?'</p>
<p><!-- Page 210 --><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>&quot;'Forward
again!' shouted the kingfisher, tightening the rope once more.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur felt the sturgeon shiver, and was conscious that his
movements were weaker. Another leap, and he burst the rope; but as
he jumped he tossed his load of sea-weed high in the air; it fell,
and Arthur with it, on a rock.</p>
<p>&quot;The owl gave a long, dismal cry, the kingfisher swept madly
away after the sturgeon, and Arthur, bruised and sore, lay panting
on the rock. For a long while he could do nothing. The owl went off
in search of food, promising to return at nightfall. The day wore
on. Arthur, weak with hunger, tried to devour some of the sea-weed.
It was too bitter and salty. Leaning over the edge of the rock, he
saw a shoal of tiny fishes playing hide-and-seek in the eddies of
the stream. He clutched at one of them and devoured it. Never had
he tasted a sweeter morsel. He caught another, and another, until
his hunger was fully appeased. Evening came again; the moon shone
early; Arthur was awakened from a long nap by the hooting of the
owl, which said,</p>
<p>&quot;'Here I am again, my distressed friend.'</p>
<p>&quot;At the same moment the kingfisher swooped
<!-- Page 211 --><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>down on them,
and stood tilting and flapping his wings on a corner of the rock.
'Now,' said he, 'as I am a bird of my word, and have promised to
help you, we will proceed to business. This sea-weed is dry, as you
see, and very much lighter. You, Mrs. Owl, can easily carry it,
while I will take your young friend Mr. Frog. Let us be off at
once, you, madam, directing the flight.'</p>
<p>&quot;The kingfisher and Arthur then heaped the sea-weed upon the
owl, and Arthur, clambering on the rather oily back of the
kingfisher, was once again going over the tree-tops.</p>
<p>&quot;Before morning they had reached the desired spot, the flat rock
under the chestnut-tree, placed the sea-weed upon it, and, hardly
waiting for thanks, the kingfisher left them.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur thanked the owl warmly, assuring her of his deep
gratitude. To which the owl replied, 'You have done me quite as
good service, and my thanks are quite as due to you. I return to my
empty nest a desolate mother, but never shall I forget your
generous sympathy. Possibly I may find consolation, but should I
ever raise another brood, it could never equal the beauty of my
lost darlings. Alas! we feathered
<!-- Page 212 --><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>creatures
have great trials: we toil diligently for our families, build nests
at great cost of time and effort, often to see them swept away by
the winds; or, our nests lasting, and unattacked by enemies, many a
young bird is thrown to the earth by the violence of storms, and
comes to an untimely end through starvation. Sympathy, therefore,
we appreciate; it helps us to bear our sorrows with becoming
fortitude. Never shall I forget your gallantry, my friend; the
thought of it will cheer many a solitary hour when all the world is
asleep. I bid you farewell.' So saying, the owl flapped her wings
and was gone.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur hopped away from the chestnut-tree to the place where he
had lost himself. It was early morning, but he was wearied, and
slept in spite of all his anxiety. When he awoke he was no longer a
frog, but a very hungry boy. The noonday sun was shining, and at
his side hopped a little brown bird. It twittered gladly, as if
congratulating him, but not one word could he understand. Before
this adventure he would have probably frightened it away, but now
he reached out his hand softly and stroked its feathers, then
seeking berries, he placed them where
<!-- Page 213 --><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>the little
creature could feast upon them. It peered at him with its bright
little eyes, and even perched upon his shoulder. Never again did
Arthur idly destroy any living creature of the woods&mdash;not the
humblest weed or flower, bright-winged insect or speckled egg. Nor
did he loiter again when sent upon errands. The elves thereafter
left him in peace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-bye, dear Phil; I am off now. This is my last story.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where am I? Has the music stopped? Was it my wind harp&mdash;my
poor little wind harp?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Phil, your wind harp is broken. Did you not know that it
fell from your window last night?&quot; said Lisa, coming into the
dining-room.</p>
<p>&quot;No. I wonder if I shall ever see the wind fairy again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dreaming again, Phil?&quot; said Lisa.</p>
<p>&quot;You always think I dream, Lisa, whenever I speak of
fairies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do I, dear? Well, you must get ready now for Graham; he is
coming to take you out on the lake. Miss Schuyler will not be home
to <!-- Page 214 --><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>dinner,
and we three are to have ours on Eagle Island.&quot;</p>
<p>Phil went up-stairs and gathered together the broken pieces of
his wind harp. He folded each piece up carefully in paper, and put
them all away. &quot;No more fairy stories,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Well,
I suppose I am getting beyond them, and must put up with sober
facts; but they are not half so nice,&quot; he said, with a
sigh&mdash;&quot;Not half so nice.&quot; Then he took out his sketch-book and
pencils, and prepared for work.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XIV</h4>
<h5>PLANS FOR THE WINTER</h5>
<p>Summer had gone. Visitors had gone. Graham had gone to school.
The banks of the lake were red and yellow, brown and purple, with
autumnal foliage. Aunt Rachel was superintending the making of
preserves. Lisa was at work on the piazza. Phil was sketching.</p>
<p>Slowly up the garden path came old Joe. He took off his hat and
stood still a moment waiting for Phil to speak.</p>
<p><!-- Page 215 --><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>&quot;Well,
Joe, what is it?&quot; said Phil, hardly looking up, he was so busy.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just as fine as ever the garden of Eden was, but old
Adam had to go, you know, Massa Phil.&quot; He had lately, of his own
accord, put the Massa before Phil's name.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you driving at, Joe?&quot; asked Phil, absently.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean I's a-gwine home, Massa Phil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To the city?&quot; said Phil, surprised into attention.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, back to New York. I wants to go to work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you not enough to do here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Joe, with a chuckle. &quot;It's all play here&mdash;no
real hard work sich as I's customed to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is time you took it easy, Joe,&quot; said Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;True nuff, but I's not one of the easy sort. Besides, who
knows, Massa Phil, but there may be other chillen&mdash;poor sick
chillen&mdash;waitin' for to hear my fiddle an' be comforted?&quot;</p>
<p>Phil looked up hastily; a bright look of gratitude and love came
into his eyes.</p>
<p>Just then Miss Schuyler appeared, with a
<!-- Page 216 --><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>glass jar of
jelly in her hand; the maid was following with a trayful.</p>
<p>&quot;Joe wants to go to the city, Aunt Rachel,&quot; said Phil.</p>
<p>&quot;I dare say,&quot; was the ready response. &quot;He wants a little gossip
over the kitchen fires, and he wants this nice jar of jelly for his
bread-and-butter when he has company to tea; and as we all are
going home next week, he may as well wait for the rest of us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aunt Rachel!&quot; said Phil, in dismay. Going home to the city
seemed like going back to poverty and illness, and the garret room
he so well remembered.</p>
<p>Aunt Rachel divined it all. &quot;You belong to me now, Phil. Lisa
and I are partners henceforth; and while you and I travel in search
of health, study, and improvement, Lisa is going to keep house for
us in her own nice, quiet way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Travel!&mdash;where?&mdash;when?&quot; said Phil, eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;The doctors suggest our going abroad&mdash;to a warm climate
for the winter&mdash;where we please; in summer, to the German
baths.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Aunt Rachel!&quot;</p>
<p>This was enough for Phil to think of and
<!-- Page 217 --><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>wonder about
all the rest of the happy days at the lake. He could walk now with
comparative ease, not of course without crutches, and the gold and
scarlet glory of the autumn leaves was a perpetual delight to him.
He gathered them for wreaths and bouquets; he pressed them and
ironed them and varnished them, and tried every method suggested to
him for keeping them; and when it came packing time it was found
necessary to get an extra trunk to contain all the woodland
treasures.</p>
<p>The happy summer had ended, and not without a lingering look of
regret that it could not last longer was the farewell said to the
house and lake and every pretty graceful tree or plant that adorned
them.</p>
<p>They found the city house all in nice order for them, for Aunt
Rachel was always wise in her forethought and provision for future
comfort.</p>
<p>Phil's little room near her own had been especially attended to,
and he found it, in all its arrangements, as complete and
satisfactory as the lovely summer nook he had vacated.</p>
<p>In three weeks' time they were to start for Europe. The days
were spent in preparation. <!-- Page 218 --><a name="Page_218"
id="Page_218"></a>Phil must have a steamer-chair, plenty of
clothes, wraps, and contrivances. All Aunt Rachel's thoughts were
for Phil's comfort; but it did not spoil him nor make him selfish;
he had the happy faculty of receiving kindness gracefully, as if
glad to be the means of making others happy by his gratitude, not
as if it were his due in any way. And in his turn he was thoughtful
and considerate for others, in trifles light as air, but
nevertheless showing by the gentle, tender manner that he meant
them as evidences of his affection. He knew Lisa dreaded parting
from him, so before her he was quite silent as to his expected
pleasures, although his imagination was constantly picturing the
details of an ocean voyage. His sketch-book was getting full of
yachts and craft of all sorts and sizes&mdash;some that would have
astonished a sailor very much. Whenever he met Lisa he kissed her,
whether with hat on she was hurrying out on some errand for Miss
Schuyler, or on her return, with arms full of bundles, she was
hastening through the hall.</p>
<p>He was necessarily left much alone, and thus had the chance to
draw a charming little picture for Lisa, and frame it with acorns,
lichen, <!-- Page 219 --><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>and
red maple leaves. He hung it in her room one day when she was out,
and, to his surprise, the next day it was missing. He had expected
some recognition of it, but none coming, he kept still, wondering
what Lisa had done with it. The secret came out in due time.</p>
<p>A day or two before their departure Lisa came to him with tears
in her eyes and a little package in her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Open it, dear; it is for you.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a tiny leather purse with four dollars in it.</p>
<p>&quot;Lisa, you must not give me all this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it is yours&mdash;your own earnings. I sold your little
picture, and bought this purse with part of the money, so that you
might have something to spend just as you pleased.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Lisa!&quot; was all Phil could say, for though grateful, he was
yet disappointed that Lisa had not kept his picture.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, dear,&quot; she said, &quot;you can buy some little trifle for Joe,
and any one else you want to make a present to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Lisa; yes, I will. It is a very nice purse,&quot; he
replied; but as soon as he could find Miss Schuyler he unburdened
his heart.</p>
<p><!-- Page 220 --><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>&quot;After all
the pains I took with that little picture, Aunt Rachel, to think of
Lisa's selling it! Oh, how could she?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hush, dear Phil; Lisa is the most unselfish creature in the
world. Has she not given you up to me? And for the pleasure she
supposed it would give you to have money of your own earning, she
was willing to part with even a thing so precious as a picture
painted by you for her. Do not question her motive for a moment.
Take the money, and buy her something useful. Come, we will go get
a pretty work-basket; she will find it even more to her taste than
a picture.&quot;</p>
<p>So they went out and bought a light, nicely shaped basket, with
little pockets all around it, and Aunt Rachel made it complete with
a silver thimble, a strawberry emery cushion, a morocco
needle-book, and an ample supply of silk, thread, needles, pins,
and buttons.</p>
<p>Lisa was delighted; but Phil could not be satisfied until he had
painted another little picture, and made Lisa promise that no one
else should ever have it.</p>
<p>Joe was made happy with some new bandanna handkerchiefs in
brilliant yellows and <!-- Page 221 --><a name="Page_221"
id="Page_221"></a>reds, a pipe, some tobacco, and a suit of clothes
from Miss Schuyler.</p>
<p>It was a tranquil, lovely day in the fall when the steamship
sailed with Aunt Rachel and Phil on board. All the bay sparkled in
the sunshine, and boats of every shape and size danced upon the
blue water. After the bustle and confusion of getting off, the
leave-takings, the cries and shouts of sailors, the blowing of
whistles and ringing of bells, they sat quietly down to watch the
receding shores, and look out upon the glittering water.</p>
<p>&quot;Aunt Rachel,&quot; said Phil, &quot;It all seems like another fairy story
to me, and we are sailing in a nautilus to the island of Heart's
Ease.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, dear child, so it does. And let us hope that we shall find
that beautiful island, and never wish to leave it.&quot;</p>

<!-- Page 222 --><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>FLORIO AND
FLORELLA</h2>
<h3>A CHRISTMAS FAIRY TALE</h3>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>There was once a child named Florio, who had neither father nor
mother, uncle nor aunt, and so it happened that he was adopted by a
witch. He might have had a fairy godmother if anybody had
remembered to ask one to the christening, but as no one took enough
interest in him for that, it was neglected, and poor Florio became
the property of a hideous, hateful old hag, who was never so happy
as when she was making trouble. Of course Florio was compelled to
do her bidding. Naturally inoffensive and gentle, he was
continually obliged to do violence to his conscience by obeying the
witch.</p>
<p>For instance, the witch&mdash;who was known by the name of
Fussioldfuri, and lived in a miserable cavern when she was not
travelling about&mdash;had <!-- Page 223 --><a name="Page_223"
id="Page_223"></a>great delight in spoiling any one's innocent
amusement or upsetting his or her plans; she even started children
quarrelling and disputing; indeed, she found this one of her
particular pastimes when she was not engaged in annoying older
people.</p>
<p>It was among children that she made Florio particularly
useful&mdash;so useful, in fact, that he never had a friend. If she
found him amusing himself with a happy little company, she made him
do some selfish or ugly thing which at once put a stop to all the
cheerfulness; and often, before he knew what he was about, he would
be struggling and kicking and screaming and flinging himself upon
one or the other of his comrades, while Fuss&mdash;as we must call
her for convenience&mdash;laughed till she shook, and tears of joy
ran down her ugly leathery cheeks. Then Florio, ashamed, miserable,
and unhappy, would creep off to a corner and weep as if his little
heart would break.</p>
<p>It was after one of these dreadful occurrences one day that
Florio, hiding in the woods, heard a strange rustling among the
bushes. He was so used to wandering about after old Fuss, and
living anyhow and anywhere, that he was more
<!-- Page 224 --><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>like a little
creature of the woods himself than anything else, and it took a
good deal to frighten him. Patter, patter, patter it went. What
could it be? He peered in and out and under the bush, but he saw
nothing except a nest full of little blue eggs, which he would not
touch for the world; no, he knew too well how pleased old Fuss
would be to have him disturb this little bird family, and he
concealed it again. As he did so, the sweetest little voice
said,</p>
<p>&quot;That's right.&quot;</p>
<p>Florio jumped as if a wasp had stung him.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; continued the voice, &quot;you couldn't have pleased me
better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But who are you? where are you?&quot; asked Florio, to whom kind
words were unknown, but on whom they had the effect of making his
heart beat with a new and strange emotion.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot tell you anything just now very well, but if you will
meet me here in the moonlight this evening, Florio, I will be glad
to see you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To-night?&quot; questioned the boy, who did not like the
darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, child; have no fear. I am the fairy Florella. Adieu.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 225 --><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>The days
were generally too short for Florio, who hated the nights in the
dismal cavern, when Fuss pulled his hair and pinched his nose and
tripped him up over her staff by way of amusement; but now he
longed for the night to come, although it must be confessed he was
not without fears. Fuss was uglier than usual, but this did not
affect Florio as it might have done had he not had something
unusual and exciting to think of. Soon as the witch tumbled down on
her heap of straw for the night, and showed by her heavy breathing
and frightful snoring that she was asleep, Florio crept softly from
the cavern.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful evening, soft and balmy, but to leave the
bright roadway and enter the dark woods demanded some courage, for
ill-usage had rendered Florio timid in the darkness, though, as I
have said before, he did not fear wild animals. Indeed, when a
young fox came cautiously out of the thicket, and glanced about,
Florio approached near enough to touch his bushy tail.</p>
<p>It was somewhat difficult to find the precise spot of the day's
occurrence, but he noticed that whenever he went in a wrong
direction a crowd <!-- Page 226 --><a name="Page_226"
id="Page_226"></a>of fire-flies would start up and show him the
right way, and thus he was enabled to find the sweet-brier bush. As
he reached it he heard the same patter, patter, patter on the
leaves of the bush, and looking up he saw what caused the sound.
Troops of tiny creatures were fluttering from leaf to leaf. Each
had little silvery wings like butterflies, and each carried sprigs
and sprays of blossoms, while following them came elves of most
grotesque appearance, bearing platters of fruit and wild honey. In
a moment they had formed a circle on the grass, and danced about,
singing as they went, while the elves arranged a feast.</p>
<p>When all was in readiness, one&mdash;of largest size and of
apparent superiority&mdash;beckoned to Florio to come near. Afraid
to disobey, yet equally fearful of treading upon them, Florio
approached, and in a moment he was surrounded, and with gentle
pressure obliged to take their various offerings. One gave him
grape leave cups and baskets woven of perfumed grasses, another
filled them with honey and fruit, while all laughed to see what
appeared to them the enormous quantities necessary for one so
large.</p>
<p><!-- Page 227 --><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>&quot;Florio,
you have done well to obey me,&quot; said the same sweet voice he had
heard in the daytime. &quot;This, added to your consideration for the
bird's-nest to-day, has pleased me, and your evident misery has
aroused my compassion. Fussioldfuri is an enemy of ours, and I
never expected to see one trained by her show a pitiful or kind
spirit. It proves to me that there must be something in you worth
cultivating. Are you willing to be guided by me? Do you want to
leave old Fuss, and become one of my servitors?&quot;</p>
<p>Florio was not quite sure that he fully understood all that was
said to him, but he was delighted at the idea of leaving Fuss, and
said so.</p>
<p>Florella smiled upon him, and continued, &quot;It may not be so easy
as you imagine; those who serve me have to stand a test of
faithfulness, energy, and courage. Our life seems one of careless
mirth, but it is not so. We, of course, are happy, and enjoy
ourselves; but we have many duties, and are not altogether free, as
would be supposed. I am at the head of this little band. We are
Flower Fairies, cousins to the Wind Fairies and Herb Elves. I am
familiar with every wild-flower that grows, and I
<!-- Page 228 --><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>am now
desirous of getting for our forests some seeds of the Swiss
Edelweiss. If you can procure them for me I will reward you
handsomely.&quot;</p>
<p>Poor Florio heard this speech with consternation. He had never
in all his life known one flower from another. Where, when, how
could he go? And if he went, how should he escape Fuss? These
thoughts made the poor child falter and grow pale. It would have
been so much easier to say he could not do it, and have done with
the matter; but the remembrance of his horrible slavery, and the
thought that Florella believed in his ability to aid her,
stimulated his courage, and he said,</p>
<p>&quot;I know nothing of flowers, dear lady; I am a very ignorant
fellow; but if you will direct me, and tell me where to go, I am
ready to try.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Spoken well, my lad,&quot; said the fairy. &quot;I do not expect
impossibilities. <i>We</i> are the only ones who can do what seems
impossible to man. The Edelweiss is a mountain flower, growing on
the highest Alps, and many a man has lost his life striving to
pluck it for one he loved. It is much esteemed for its rarity, and
because of the often great difficulty of getting it. See, here
<!-- Page 229 --><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>is a dried
blossom;&quot; and she put in his hand a small white flower like an
immortelle, though Florio thought that it looked as if it were made
of flannel, it was so soft and woolly.</p>
<p>&quot;This you must keep; see, I will put it in this case of
birch-bark, and you had better place it in your bosom. Now I must
tell you about the journey. To leave Fussioldfuri immediately might
make the task more difficult. She is about starting for the
mountains, and if you keep with her a while longer you will be able
to find the place you need much sooner than if you went alone. But
when you reach Geneva you are to leave her. Can you remember
that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, the rhyme will help me:</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1.3em;">&quot;'When I get to
Geneva,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then I must leave her.'&quot;</span></p>
<p>&quot;Exactly; and then you are to seek the Edelweiss, and when you
have gathered the seeds you are to meet me here in this forest,
whether it be winter or whether it be summer. Adieu.&quot;</p>
<p>The fairy vanished, and with her went her band&mdash;nodding,
waving, and kissing their finger-tips.</p>
<p>Oh, how dreary the woods seemed without the
<!-- Page 230 --><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>little troop!
The wind sighed in the pines, and the moonlight cast fearful
shadows from the gnarled and knotty boughs.</p>
<p>Florio rose with a sigh and stretched his limbs, wondering if it
was worth while to try and do the fairy's bidding when he had to go
back to hear the dreaded voice of old Fuss. Then he made sure of
the birch-bark case, and again with the aid of the fire-flies found
the road. Fuss was sound asleep still when he laid himself down on
his bundle of straw in the farthest corner of the cavern. One thing
he did not notice, and that was the young fox whose bushy tail he
had touched going into the woods. It had followed him home, and
crept in under the straw beside him.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER II</h4>
<p>High up in the Swiss mountains a storm was brewing. On their
cloud-capped summits nothing could be seen but snow&mdash;dazzling,
blinding white snow, and wreaths of vapor which congealed as it
fell. All day the people of the hamlets had been preparing for
<!-- Page 231 --><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>the visitor,
knowing full well that they should be housed for weeks after its
descent, and as Christmas was approaching, it was needful that much
should be done.</p>
<p>As the day grew darker, each hurried to complete his or her
work, and none essayed more eagerly to do this than young Franz,
the goatherd; but try as he would, the heedless, wanton little
flock were constantly escaping from him, and if it had not been for
Jan, the great mastiff of the famous St. Bernard breed, he would
have been still more troubled. As it was, he found one goat missing
when he went to house them, and again he had to take his alpenstock
and try what he could do.</p>
<p>By this time the storm was indeed upon them, and between the
wind and the snow, the icy atmosphere and the darkness, Franz had
about concluded to let the goat go, when Jan began to sniff about
and bark, and show by signs as easily read as print that he was
seeking something. Franz thought it must be on account of the goat,
but just then old Nan appeared with her customary capriciousness,
and made no resistance to the cord with which Franz bound her.</p>
<p><!-- Page 232 --><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>Still Jan
kept up his scratching and sniffing and barking, and Franz knew
only too well that there was no use in opposing him, although his
fingers and toes were half frozen.</p>
<p>As soon as the dog saw that Franz recognized the necessity of
following him he quieted down, and with a zealous industry nosed
the path from side to side, as if in search of something; nor did
he have to go far, for they presently descried what seemed like a
big snow-heap on one side of the now undiscoverable path.</p>
<p>Here Jan halted and looked intently; then he began scratching
and whining again, and Franz saw a bit of cloth. Soon an arm
appeared, and next a leg, and after vigorous work from both Franz
and Jan, the whole figure of a child, clasping something in its
arms, was uncovered. Dead or alive, Franz knew not which it was;
but very well he knew what it was the child carried, for its big
bushy red tail showed it to be a fox, and it too was as motionless
and lifeless as the child.</p>
<p>The goatherd had braved the dangers of the mountains all his
lifetime, and knew how to be cool and decided in the presence of
danger. He had his knife and drinking-cup beside him, and
<!-- Page 233 --><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>his horn
slung over his shoulder. In a moment he had made Nan stand still
while he milked her, and then he pried open the stiff lips of the
lad, and forced the warm liquid within. As he did so, the child
revived and swallowed, for he had not been long unconscious. Then
putting him on Jan's back, and driving Nan before him, Franz made
his way home as best he could.</p>
<p>It was late when tired Franz, whose mother was in the door-way
looking anxiously for him, arrived. All the children were within,
and the fire was burning brightly. On the table the soup was
steaming. An exclamation of surprise arose from all as Jan and his
burden marched in.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is it?&quot; &quot;Where did he come from?&quot; &quot;Where did you find him?&quot;
&quot;What was he doing all alone in the storm?&quot; burst from all their
lips.</p>
<p>&quot;So, so; slowly, please,&quot; answered the cool and courageous
Franz. Then he told them his adventure.</p>
<p>&quot;A stranger lad, lost on the roadside,&quot; murmured the mother, as
she took the boy from Jan and carefully undressed him, the children
meanwhile attending to the nearly frozen fox.</p>
<p><!-- Page 234 --><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>&quot;Poor
child! poor child! he shall be welcome. A sorry Christmas it is for
him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not when he fell into your hands, good mother,&quot; said Franz,
ladling out the soup.</p>
<p>&quot;No indeed&mdash;no indeed,&quot; said one and all.</p>
<p>But the mother's words seemed to be the truth, for though the
child revived, and was able to take nourishment, a fever set in,
from which he did not rally. Day by day he lay in the little
curtained recess where he could see them all with his great
wondering eyes, watching them carve their beautiful toys&mdash;for
this was their winter work&mdash;but saying nothing, for he knew
not their language, and only one word had he uttered which they
could understand.</p>
<p>This word was simply &quot;Edelweiss.&quot; &quot;Edelweiss,&quot; he muttered, when
the fever was at its height, and &quot;Edelweiss&quot; he softly whispered
when dreaming.</p>
<p>The children called him &quot;Little Edelweiss,&quot; and fed his fox,
which lapped their hands and brought a sweet smile to the face of
the little sufferer.</p>
<p>Christmas-eve would be on the morrow, and all were busy dressing
the room with boughs of <!-- Page 235 --><a name="Page_235"
id="Page_235"></a>evergreen. The tree stood in the corner, waiting
for its glittering fruit. Outside the sheaf of grain had been tied
to a pole for the snow-birds. All had some trifling gifts prepared
for a joyful keeping of the day, Franz only seemed to be uneasy. He
would glance at the pale face of his little foundling, and then he
would look out to see if the weather was fine, and at last he
reached up for his thickest wrap and staff, and away he went up the
mountain-side. Nothing could be seen up that way but the red roof
of a convent, and peak after peak of ice piercing the blue sky.</p>
<p>It was late when he returned and put something carefully behind
the tree. All were waiting for their supper, for they were anxious
to go to bed that the dear Christmas might the sooner come.</p>
<p>His mother scolded a little, but the stranger boy put up his
thin hand reprovingly, as if he could not bear to have Franz
rebuked, and then they all laughed, for they all loved Franz.</p>
<p>But soon they were sleeping quietly, and the moon shone upon
happy faces&mdash;only the little guest tossed and murmured
&quot;Edelweiss.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 236 --><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>The morrow
came, and with it many a merry greeting. And now they could hardly
wait for the day to pass. Long before dark the table was set with
its sausages and spice-cake, and beside each plate a mysterious
packet&mdash;for the tree bore only glittering trifles. And when
the girls in their pretty scarlet bodices and whitest chemisettes
sat down, and the mother reverently asked God's blessing on their
food, all broke into a joyful carol. Then they examined their
gifts, and the little stranger was given his share of the good
things.</p>
<p>But just then Franz arose and brought from behind the tree a
curious looking box. Tearing off the papers a small but hardy plant
was revealed, and putting it in the hands of the invalid, Franz
pointed to its buds and said one word, &quot;Edelweiss.&quot;</p>
<p>A cry of joy burst from the boy's lips, and he clasped his
treasure as if it had been indeed a flower from paradise.</p>
<p>&quot;Edelweiss! Edelweiss!&quot; was all he could utter, but the sweet
and grateful tone thanked Franz better than a thousand other words
could have done.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Franz,&quot; they all asked, &quot;Where did you
<!-- Page 237 --><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>get it at
this season? It does not grow in winter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Franz, &quot;I know that it does not, but I have often
found it in summer, and I just happened to remember plucking some
by the roots last spring for Father Gl&uuml;ckner up at the
convent&mdash;he is always gathering roots and herbs for the sick,
and he has a great curiosity to transplant wild-flowers that he may
see what they will produce under cultivation. See; this plant
already has flowers&mdash;months too soon. He has several others,
so he gave me this quite willingly.&quot;</p>
<p>While they were talking, the little stranger had drawn a small
case of birch-bark from his pocket, and was earnestly comparing the
faded and pressed flower it contained with the blooming one beside
him. His face glowed with happiness, and from that moment his
restoration to health began.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER III</h4>
<p>Again the summer-time had come, with all its warmth and beauty.
The fairies were thronging all the wildwood one lovely
<!-- Page 238 --><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>summer
evening, when a tall, handsome lad, with light, quick tread and
merry glancing eyes, entered the woods, followed by a red fox, and
boldly shouted, &quot;Florella! Florella!&quot; making the woods ring with
his voice.</p>
<p>You would not have supposed that this could be the same boy
whose sobbing aroused Florella's compassion&mdash;the poor,
trembling little creature, spiritless and unhappy, who had hardly
dared to say his name was Florio. But so it was; and when he called
so loudly in his cheery voice, Florella quickly came forth from the
sweet-brier bush and stood before him.</p>
<p>Doffing the cap which covered his curly pate, and bending on one
knee, Florio presented without words the small plant which he had
guarded with the utmost care.</p>
<p>A look of gracious sweetness came into the fairy's face, and she
examined the flowers with the eye of one accustomed to look at
things closely. Having assured herself that it was the desired
plant, she turned to her assistants and invited them to examine it
also. All agreed that it was the far-famed Edelweiss, and there was
a great fluttering of wings, and soft exclamations of delight and
excited surprise, until <!-- Page 239 --><a name="Page_239"
id="Page_239"></a>Florella, with a gentle wave of her hand,
commanded silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, young knight of our fair domain,&quot; she said, addressing
Florio, &quot;give me some account of your journeying, for not only have
you done all that I desired, but more: here are not only seeds, but
flowers and root. I pray you be seated while I listen.&quot;</p>
<p>Florio had learned to be mannerly, so with cap in hand he only
leaned against a beech-tree, and began:</p>
<p>&quot;When you bade me depart with that dreadful old Fuss, dear lady,
my heart failed me entirely, and I thought I should not be able to
do your bidding. So long had I been used to her cruel power that
the thought of opposing her filled me with alarm; but curiously
enough the very night I hastened from you to the miserable cavern
we called home, a young fox followed me, and unknown to me slept by
my side. When I awoke the witch was preparing for her journey, for
on her back and by her side she carried bags of all shapes and
sizes, with everything in them that could do mischief. In one was
snuff, in another was pepper, and in a third was mustard, and in
all were flinty pebbles and <!-- Page 240 --><a name="Page_240"
id="Page_240"></a>bits of glass. Some of these were for people's
eyes and some for their feet, and she had hardly room for the
mouldly old crusts and pieces of cheese which furnished us with
food.</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as she saw the fox, which I was petting with delight,
she made a pass at it with her stick, which I am sure would have
killed it had I not caught the blow. The little fellow sprang from
my arms and bit her heel, which made her so very angry that I had
to run for my life&mdash;but, strange to say, after that he was my
only protection.</p>
<p>&quot;Although she bade me drown him, and although I, remembering
your commands, disobeyed her, she did not dare come near me when I
had him in my arms. Day after day he followed me, night after night
he slept beside me, and though I had fewer beatings, old Fuss
watched me closely; she seemed to know that I wanted to get away
from her.</p>
<p>&quot;We toiled along on the roadsides, begging from house to
house.</p>
<p>&quot;At last one day we came to a beautiful sheet of water, blue and
sparkling in the sunshine. Everywhere I went I had gathered
flowers&mdash;sometimes <!-- Page 241 --><a name="Page_241"
id="Page_241"></a>they were only weeds, such as dandelions and
daisies, but here on the banks of this lovely lake I found the
sweetest blossoms. From every one I had tried to learn the names of
the plants, but it was a very difficult matter, for half the time
they misunderstood my signs, and supposed I was only making game of
them; besides, when Fuss came up with her horrible jargon, every
one was so disgusted that he would have nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>&quot;but every day I repeated as a lesson the one word 'Edelweiss,'
and whenever I had the chance I would say this to a stranger.
Generally they took no notice&mdash;sometimes they would smile, and
point to the mountain-peaks before us.</p>
<p>&quot;The day we reached the lake Fuss was in one of her ugliest
moods: she had not received a penny from any passer-by, and she had
not been able to make a young boatman quarrel with his companions,
although she had sprinkled pepper about until they were all
sneezing as if they were crazy. I was weary and disconsolate,
sitting paddling in the water, and the fox was not by me, having
run after a rat that had <!-- Page 242 --><a name="Page_242"
id="Page_242"></a>crawled from the wreck of an old unused craft.
Without a word of warning Fuss came up behind me and gave me a
push.</p>
<p>&quot;Over I went into the water, head and heels both submerged.
Strangling, puffing, battling for my life, I rose to the surface. I
had fallen just where the water was shallow, but where grasses and
water-plants so entangled my feet that I could not swim, and should
certainly have been drowned had not one of the boatmen thrown me a
rope and drawn me to the shore.</p>
<p>&quot;'Hang her!' 'Drown her for an old witch!' were the exclamations
I heard from the rough by-standers, and also, 'Take her to the jail
at Geneva.' This aroused me. Now I knew the name of the fine town
towards which so many were wending their way.</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;'When you get to
Geneva,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then you must leave
her.'</span></p>
<p>&quot;Oh, joy! Then I need no longer follow my dreadful guide! And
there were people about who spoke English.</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as I could discover who these English people were I
made inquiries of them, and <!-- Page 243 --><a name="Page_243"
id="Page_243"></a>found they were servants of some persons
travelling in their own conveyance. Tattered and draggled and wet,
I dared not do more than run after the carriage at a respectful
distance, with my fox in my arms, and so fearful was I of being
overtaken by old Fuss that I darted into the woods whenever a
wayfarer approached. But my fears were needless, for so alarmed had
the witch been at the threats of the boatmen that she disappeared
suddenly. Some said they saw her flying over the woods on a
broomstick, with all her wretched rags and tags fluttering behind
her like the tail of a kite.</p>
<p>&quot;After this I toiled on, often hungry, always weary, but
frequently meeting with kindness. I only wanted to find some place
of shelter from the cold until the warm weather should return
again, and I could renew my search for your flower.</p>
<p>&quot;At last, one bitter day, striving to reach a convent where I
had found out they received poor people like myself, I fell, during
a blinding storm, and had neither the courage nor the wish to make
the effort to rise. Gradually a heavy sleep came on. I forgot my
woes, and dreamed of a garden of roses, among which
<!-- Page 244 --><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>floated
brilliant butterflies and golden bees.</p>
<p>&quot;I was aroused from this sleep by a barking and scratching, and
the forcing open of my mouth to make me swallow some warm milk. A
goatherd had found me, and putting me on the back of his great dog,
carried me home. From that moment my troubles ended. Franz, the boy
who found me, had a warm heart. His home became mine. I was ill,
but all did what they could to make my sufferings less. I had only
the one word, 'Edelweiss,' at my command, and but the one
hope&mdash;that of procuring the flower.</p>
<p>&quot;Christmas-day came. All were rejoicing, all were happy; but
none could appreciate my joy when the noble Franz put this plant in
my possession, his Christmas gift to me. I recovered immediately,
and happiness so inspired me that I learned their language, and was
enabled to tell them my story. All agreed that I must return to
you, but must wait till I was strong for the journey. While with my
friends I watched them carve their beautiful toys, some of which I
have brought you, and learned to do their exquisite work myself. I
also went often to the convent, and learned much from the
celebrated <!-- Page 245 --><a name="Page_245"
id="Page_245"></a>Father Gl&uuml;ckner about herbs and flowers.
See; I have brought these packets of seeds, and a good collection
of remarkable specimens. And all the time my little fox has been my
pet, my companion, my solace. Accept, then, dear lady, these proofs
of my obedience.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying, Florio finished speaking. As he stopped, his cheeks
flushed with pleasant emotion, a nightingale poured forth a
warbling stream of melody. The fairy drew her band around her and
thus spoke:</p>
<p>&quot;Happy mortal, thus to have achieved success. Your faithfulness
and courage shall be well rewarded. Look! this is your home, this
we have prepared for you. Our emissary, the young fox, had warned
us of your approach, and we have all in readiness.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, she led the astonished Florio to a cottage of
twisted vines and roots, built by herself and her attendant elves.
The walls were brilliant with innumerable glow-worms and fireflies,
which sparkled like living gems; the floor was soft with scented
rushes. Garlands of roses festooned the rooms, in one of which was
a table filled with fruit. Smiling with glee, Florella watched her
young friend's admiration, which
<!-- Page 246 --><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>ended in
complete astonishment when from an adjoining apartment came Franz
and Rosa, the goatherd and his sister. His joy was now complete,
but when he turned to thank Florella she was nowhere to be
seen.</p>
<p>Thus it came to pass that we know of the famous gardener and
seedsman Florio, whose plants are of boundless celebrity, and whose
cultivated blossoms outrival the famous exotics of the world. In
this forest he lived, and raised from season to season every flower
that grows. No frost seemed to touch them, no drought withered
them, for Florella was true to her promise of reward, and in
addition to giving Florio a home, gave him also health and wealth
and fame.</p>
<p>The elves were always on guard against moles and injurious
worms, the fairies sprinkled the seeds and protected the young
buds, and basking in the sunshine outside the cottage door was
always to be found Florio's pet, the red fox, whom Florella for a
time had chosen to be his guardian. Franz and Rosa also induced
their family to leave the Alpine snows for the beautiful land of
flowers.</p>

BLUSTER'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT</h2>
<p>&quot;'<i>Tis an ill wind that blows no good</i>.&quot;</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>It had been a hard, cold, cruel winter, and one that just suited
old Frozen Nose, the Storm King, whose palace of ice was on the
north shore of the Polar Sea. He had ordered Rain, Hail, and Snow,
his slaves, to accompany Lord Boreas Bluster on an invasion of the
temperate zone, and when they had done his bidding he harnessed up
his four-in-hand team of polar bears and went as far south as he
dared, just to see how well they had obeyed him. How he roared with
laughter when he found nearly all vegetation killed, and the earth
wrapped in a white mantle as thick as his own bear-skins piled six
feet deep! There was no nonsense about that sort of work.</p>
<p>&quot;Catch any pert, saucy little flowers sticking up their heads
through such a blanket!&quot; said <!-- Page 248 --><a name="Page_248"
id="Page_248"></a>Frozen Nose to himself. &quot;No, no; I've fixed 'em
for a few years, anyhow. They're dead as door-nails, and Spring
with all her airs and graces will never bring them to life again.
Ugh! how I hate 'em and all sweet smells! Wish I might never have
anything but whale-oil on my hair and handkerchiefs for the rest of
my life!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no fear but what you will, and stale at that,&quot; said the
ugliest of his children, young Chilblain, giving his father's big
toe a tweak as he passed, and grinning when he heard Frozen Nose
grumble out,</p>
<p>&quot;There's the gout again, I do believe!&quot;</p>
<p>But Boreas Bluster, coming in just then, saw what was going on,
and gave Chilblain a whack that sent him spinning out of the
room.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, Boreas was not as hardhearted as he looked.
He was the most honest and straightforward of all Frozen Nose's
friends. To be sure, he had to obey stern commands, and do many
things that required a show of fierceness, but in the course of his
travels he often yielded to a kind impulse, and restrained his fury
when to indulge it would have pleased old Frozen Nose mightily.</p>
<p><!-- Page 249 --><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>This very
day he had met with a strange adventure, which had been the
occasion of a hasty return to the palace, and had so stirred his
heart that the whack he gave young Chilblain was but the
safety-valve to his feelings&mdash;a sort of letting off of steam
which otherwise might have exploded and burst every block of ice in
the realm.</p>
<p>In the many furious storms which had occurred of late Boreas had
seen the destruction of numerous forests, and had even assisted in
laying waste the country. But one night an avalanche had buried a
hamlet from which only one living soul had escaped, and that was a
young child&mdash;a mere sprig of a girl, with hair like the flax
and eyes like its flowers, a little, timid, crying child&mdash;whom
B.B. had actually taken in his arms and carried all the way out of
the woods, over the mountains, and finally into Frozen Nose's own
palace by the Polar Sea.</p>
<p>Never had such a thing happened before. Never had the tones of a
child's voice pierced his dull ears, and made that big
sledge-hammer of a heart positively ache with its throbs. It was a
new and even a dangerous feeling; for though he made young
Chilblain's impertinence <!-- Page 250 --><a name="Page_250"
id="Page_250"></a>the pretext of an outburst, he might just as
readily have given a cuff to the hoary-headed Prime-minister, Sir
Solomon Snow-Ball&mdash;and then there would have been a
revolution. But happily for the peace of the Polar Sea palace, B.B.
was satisfied with Chilblain's howl of rage, and in another moment
had sunk down into his favorite arm-chair of twisted walrus tusks,
and was lost in thought.</p>
<p>It was a curious scene, these three old men half asleep in their
bear-skins, smoking long pipes of smouldering sea-weed. No fire
danced on the hearth, no lamp shed its lustre, but the moon's pale
beams gleamed on the glittering walls and lit the ice-crystals with
its silver rays. B.B.'s thoughts seemed to be of a troublesome
nature, for he sighed heavily, almost creating a whirlwind, and at
last, looking cautiously at his companions, and seeing they were
asleep, he rose and went softly from the room. In the hall was a
huge pile of furs, among which B.B. gently pushed until he found
the object of his search, which, lifting carefully, he bound about
him with thongs of reindeer hide. Then pulling on his immense
snow-shoes, and drawing his <!-- Page 251 --><a name="Page_251"
id="Page_251"></a>cap closely about his ears, he went out into the
night.</p>
<p>B.B. was aware that it would be impossible for him to keep his
little Flax-Flower any longer in Frozen Nose's dominions; indeed,
he had only hidden her in the hall until he could decide what
course to pursue, for he knew only too well that Chilblain, in
seeking revenge, would be sure to discover his secret, and do all
he could to injure him. Personally he had little to fear, but the
punishment for mortals entering Frozen Nose's realm was death, and
Flax-Flower was mortal.</p>
<p>With the speed for which he was so celebrated, Boreas slid over
the ground in a southerly direction, never stopping until he had
come upon what seemed to be a river which led down to a dark forest
of pine-trees.</p>
<p>He was now at least three thousand miles from the Storm King's
palace, and could afford to rest Wiping his brow, and panting still
with his recent efforts, Boreas drew a corner of the bundle of furs
away from the face of Flax-Flower, and looked at the sleeping
child. As he did so a thrill of tenderness made him long
<!-- Page 252 --><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>to kiss her,
but he knew that his rough caress would chill her with fear. So,
softly wrapping her up again, he plunged into the pine forest.
Stopping again when in the middle of it, he gave a shrill whistle,
which was responded to by one fainter and farther away, and
presently a dwarf in the garb of an Esquimau emerged from the dusky
gloom, and bending low, said,</p>
<p>&quot;What will you, my master?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would see thy lord, the good St. Nicholas&mdash;the Storm
King's enemy. Is he at home?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is at home, but he is no man's enemy. What message shall I
bear him?'</p>
<p>&quot;Tell him that Boreas, of the Frozen Noses, awaits him.&quot; The
dwarf vanished, and returned.</p>
<p>&quot;My lord bids thee enter, but entreats thee to be gentle, and
remember the manners of his court.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That was a needless charge, considering my errand. Never has my
mood been more peaceful. But it strikes me as passing strange thus
to dictate terms to one of my station,&quot; responded Boreas,
proudly.</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon,&quot; answered the dwarf, &quot;but we are no sticklers for
ceremony, and recognize no rank <!-- Page 253 --><a name="Page_253"
id="Page_253"></a>save goodness. Follow me if it be thy wish to
enter.&quot;</p>
<p>Pushing aside the heavy boughs on which the snow lay in icy
masses that rattled and clashed like bolts and bars, he uncovered a
low-arched opening into what seemed a vast snow-bank. Through this
tunnel he and Boreas made their way to a broad court, which was as
airy as a soap-bubble, round in shape, with pillars and dome of
glass, through which streamed rays of light softer than sunshine
and brighter than moonbeams.</p>
<p>From this court a broad, low stairway led to another apartment,
which was as free from any show or splendor as the kitchen of a
farm-house, and, indeed, in its suggestion of homely comfort and
hospitality it was not unlike that cheery place. A Saxon motto,
meaning &quot;Welcome to those who hunger,&quot; was carved in the wooden
frame of the fireplace. The floor was sanded, the tables and chairs
were of oak, blackened by age, as were also the timbers of the
ceiling, and cut and carved with curious devices.</p>
<p>On a big settle by the fire sat an old man, whose twinkling eyes
could but just see through the shaggy and snowy brows which
overhung <!-- Page 254 --><a name="Page_254"
id="Page_254"></a>them, and whose white beard fell in a flowing
mass upon his breast. What could be seen of his face bore a kind
expression.</p>
<p>&quot;Ho, ho, old Bluster!&quot; he cried, in a clear and merry voice,
drawing up and around him the sheepskin mantle which was beside
him, &quot;What new freak is this of yours to enter our peaceful
dwelling? Methought you were so sworn to do the Storm King's
bidding that no power other than his rough sway could compel your
presence. Come you on your own account or on his? Be it either, you
are free to partake of our bounty. Ho, there, Merrythought! heave
on more logs and heat the poker, that we may thrust it fizzing into
our tankards: 'tis always bitter cold when Boreas is abroad.&quot;</p>
<p>The dwarf skipped quickly to his task, assisted by a dozen
others, and Boreas, unstrapping his bundle, drew little
Flax-Flower, still sleeping, from the furs.</p>
<p>&quot;Mine is a strange errand, good Claus&mdash;so strange, that I
hardly know myself to be myself. Rough and stormy as I am ever, a
child's misery has made me once gentle. You know my mad career, my
furious passions, and that they indeed are the strength of the
Storm King's realm. <!-- Page 255 --><a name="Page_255"
id="Page_255"></a>Too well I knew that I should be but the sport of
mocking derision if I appealed to his mercy in behalf of this
suffering child. Mercy, did I say? He knows none. Death alone could
have met this little creature, whose cries have aroused within me
the deepest feelings I have ever known. To be honest, I have not
always been the fierce being I appear. Many and many a time,
unknown to you, I have followed you on your errands of love and
pity, and watched with admiration the course you have pursued. This
has induced me now to come and ask your favor for my treasure.
Wake, little Flax-Flower, wake!&quot; he continued, gently kissing the
child's eyes, who, so stirred, rubbed her sleepy lids with rosy
little fists, and looked around in astonishment.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha!&quot; said the good St. Nicholas; &quot;This is indeed a strange
story for you to tell, friend Bluster. Ho, there, Merrythought!
send for Mrs. Christmas, my house-keeper. The child may be
frightened at our grim faces. But what a pretty little dear it is!&quot;
said Claus, in the kindest tones, putting out his big fat hand to
caress her. To Boreas's surprise Flax-Flower did not shrink from
his salute, but with a bright smile
<!-- Page 256 --><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>bounded into
the old man's arms and kissed him.</p>
<p>Turning away with a pang of jealousy, Boreas muttered, &quot;She
wouldn't kiss <i>me</i>; but no matter. That settles it. She's in
the right place, and I'll leave her. Farewell, Claus; I'm off. No,
no; I've no time for eating and drinking. Frozen Nose will be
thundering at my absence already. There's a storm brewing even now;
I feel it in my bones.&quot; So saying, he tramped noisily out of the
apartment, nearly knocking over a fleshy dame in ruffled cap and
whitest apron, whose rosy cheeks were like winter apples, and who
bore in her hands a huge mince-pie in which was stuck a sprig of
mistletoe.</p>
<hr style="Width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER II</h4>
<p>&quot;Come mother, cease thy spinning, and look at the lovely tree
that Olaf has brought thee; it stands as straight as himself in the
best room. Surely thou wilt deck it to please him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, Fritz! how can I?&quot; said the forester's wife, rising from
her wheel, with a sad but sweet smile, in obedience to her husbands
wishes.</p>
<p><!-- Page 257 --><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>&quot;But there
is surely no reason for longer indulging thy grief. Our child is
too happy in heaven to wish her return to earth, and whatever the
good God sends of pleasure or innocent mirth we should take with
thankfulness. Look at the tree; it is the very image of Olaf's own
strong youth. Make it pretty to-night, and he will be glad. A good
friend is he for two lonely beings like us to possess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are right, Fritz,&quot; said the wife, wiping a tear from her
eyes. &quot;For Olaf's sake I will dress the tree and bake a cake.&quot; So
saying, she tidied up her best parlor, and took from a brass-bound
chest the gay ribbons and trinkets which had not been used since
the Christmas eve her little one last spent on earth.</p>
<p>Very lonely and sad would these two people have been but for
Olaf, the son of their nearest neighbor. It was he whose clear
ringing voice might be heard in the forest when returning from his
work, and Fritz said that it made labor light but to hear him. It
was he, too, who, when Fritz had been lamed by the fall of a tree,
had borne him home on his strong young shoulders; so it was no
wonder that the good wife was grateful to him. Often at evening he
made their <!-- Page 258 --><a name="Page_258"

and now it was but just that they should shake off their sorrow for
his sake; so the good wife drew out her spotless board, and kneaded
spice-cakes, and spread her best damask, and set out the fine
china.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, if I had my little one!&quot; murmured the good woman. &quot;but God

blessings.</p>
<p>&quot;Here comes Olaf!&quot; shouted Fritz from below. &quot;Come quickly, lest
he think thee tardy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I come. I see him,&quot; was her reply. &quot;but what is that
he carries&mdash;something he has picked up on the way?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A Christmas gift for thee,&quot; was the merry answer from Olaf's
ringing voice, as he laid a strange bundle in her arms.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III</h4>
<p>Little Flax-Flower had been with St. Nicholas a whole long week.
In that time she had been in every nook and corner of his dwelling.
She had seen all his elves and dwarfs
<!-- Page 259 --><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>at work
manufacturing every known toy to be found in the world. She had
watched the dolls' dress-makers; she had ridden the toy horses; she
had blown the brass bugles and beaten the drums until Mrs.
Christmas had to put cotton in her ears.</p>
<p>Now all this was very delightful, and made Santa Claus laugh
long and loud. He would not have cared if she had brought the house
down on his ears, so long as she had a bright smile and a kiss for
him. But when Boreas Bluster stopped to see how his young ward was
getting on, he shook his head gravely and told Mrs. Christmas he
feared she was spoiling Flax-Flower. But Mrs. Christmas laughed
just in the same manner that Santa Claus had done, and declared
that the child must have all she wanted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Flax-Flower went into the kitchen one day, and
finding all the cooks busily making sugar-plums, helped herself so
largely to taffy that she was made very ill; she ate, besides,
quite a menagerie of lemon-candy elephants, camels, and kangaroos,
which disagreed with themselves and with her; so that her head
ached, and she had to be put to bed, with a hot-water bottle and a
mustard draught for companions. This
<!-- Page 260 --><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>happened just
as Boreas had stopped in to inquire about his pet, and he shook his
head gravely when Mrs. Christmas related the incident. But Santa
Claus only laughed till the air seemed full of merriment.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, my dear Claus, I see you have too easy and gentle a nature
to deal with wilful little mortals in an every-day way; besides,
you have to think of so many that it unfits you for the care of a
single one,&quot; said Boreas, in his least gruff manner. &quot;I shall have
to find another home for Flax-Flower.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied St. Nicholas, &quot;I confess I can refuse nothing to
a good child. Children to me are all like so many empty
stockings&mdash;made to be filled. But I have had some doubts about
keeping Flax-Flower. Mrs. Christmas and I are afraid it will make
the others jealous; it is that, and not the stuffing down
lollipops, that makes me think you are right. Now her feast-day
comes soon&mdash;I mean Mrs. Christmas's day,&quot; said Santa Claus,
with a nod&mdash;&quot;And if you will just give my sleigh a lift, I
think I can tuck in Flaxie and carry her to some people I
know&mdash;some people who will appreciate her and be kind to her;
yes, and even cross in a <!-- Page 261 --><a name="Page_261"
id="Page_261"></a>wholesome way, seeing that's what you approve
of.&quot;</p>
<p>Here Santa pretended to be very gruff himself, but Boreas saw
through it. He knew that St. Nicholas, on the whole, believed that
Flaxie would be better off without so much amusement and without so
many temptations to do nothing but play all day long, and this was
the way the matter ended.</p>
<p>Just before Christmas day Santa Claus's sleigh was brought out
into the beautiful court I have described; eight lively young
reindeer were harnessed to it, and thousands of toys were packed in
it; furs were wrapped around Flaxie, who was now quite well, and
Mrs. Christmas herself made up a box of delicacies for her to eat
on the way.</p>
<p>&quot;Think of us often, dear child,&quot; she whispered, &quot;And give my
love to <i>everybody</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>Then the dwarfs gave the sleigh a push from behind, the bells of
the harness rang out a merry peal, the reindeer pranced, Santa
Claus snapped his whip, and away they flew, with Boreas behind them
on his snow-shoes.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Flaxie,&quot; said Santa Claus, after they had skimmed over the
snow with lightning speed <!-- Page 262 --><a name="Page_262"
id="Page_262"></a>for hours, &quot;before you go to sleep, as I see you
are doing, I want to speak to you. I want you always to remember
this visit to my house with pleasure, and tell all the children you
may meet how much I love them, how much it pleases me to know that
they are good, and how it really distresses me when they are not;
tell them, too, that as long as Mrs. Christmas lives we will do all
we can for their happiness, and all we ask in return is a grateful
spirit. Do you think you can remember all this? Well, as you say
you can, tell them also to hang up an extra stocking, whenever
there is room by the chimney, for some little waif that hasn't a
stocking to hang up for himself. Now go to sleep as soon as you
please, and may your dreams be sweet!&quot;</p>
<p>Cuddled down in the comfortable furs, Flaxie knew nothing more
till she found herself awake and in the arms of a tall young fellow
whose name was Olaf, and who carried her into the brightest, nicest
little parlor, and set her down in front of a fine Christmas-tree,
saying,</p>
<p>&quot;There, Mistress Kindheart, see what Christmas has brought you.
I found her in the forest, and a great bearded giant told me to
bring her to you.&quot;</p>
<p><!-- Page 263 --><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>&quot;Oh, Olaf,
it is my little Lena come back, I do believe!&quot; cried the woman,
while tears of joy ran down her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Nay, mother, nay,&quot; said her husband; &quot;but she shall take our
lost one's place. Come, little one, tell us who thou art and from
whence thou art come.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Flaxie told the story of her visit to St. Nicholas, while
Olaf, Fritz, and his wife listened in amazement.</p>
<p>Much as Flax-Flower had enjoyed all she had seen and done, it
was delightful to be again with people of her own flesh and blood,
and learn to say the sweet word &quot;Mother.&quot;</p>
<p>That Christmas was a merry one, but no merrier than the many
which came after, for Flax-Flower became a dutiful daughter to the
kind people who gave her a home. She and Olaf were like sister and
brother to each other, and they were known throughout all the
country-side for their kindness to the poor and unfortunate,
especially at Christmas-time.</p>
<p>Frozen Nose still reigns in his palace on the Polar Sea, and it
is mainly owing to him and his wicked son Chilblain that nothing
more is known of that still unexplored region; but
<!-- Page 264 --><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>Boreas
Bluster spends much of his time with good St. Nicholas and Mrs.
Christmas. He tires of the severity of his life, and likes a snug
corner where he can relate the story of his finding Flax-Flower,
whom he still loves very tenderly. Often on an evening he ventures
down to take a peep at her in her happy home, and little does she
suspect that the cooling breeze at the close of a warm day is
Boreas's gift of thoughtful kindness.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
