<h3>SPARKLING WAVES OVER HIGH EXPLOSIVES</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Was there ever a woman who did not very greatly desire for
herself, at long moments, the doublet and hose of a man, perhaps
also his sword, as well as his attitude in the viewing of life? I
think not. To a very small number of those ladies of great
curiosity it has been granted that they climb to those ramparts of
the life of a man; but it was needful that they be stout of limb
and sturdy of heart to sustain themselves upon that eminence and
not be dashed below upon the rocks of a strange land. I, Roberta,
Marquise de Grez and Bye, have obtained glimpses into a far country
and this is what I bring on returning, not as a spy, but, shall I
say, laden with spices and forbidden fruit?</p>
<p>And for me it has been a very fine dash into the wilds of a land
of strangeness, and I do not know that I have yet found myself
completely returned unto my estate of a woman.</p>
<p>I first began to realize that I was set out upon a great journey
when I stood at the rail of the very large ship and watched it plow
its way through the waves which they told us with their splendor
hid cruel mines. I felt the future might be like unto those great
waves, and it might be that it would break in sparkling crests over
high explosives. I found them!</p>
<p>I had seen a fear of those explosives of life come in my dying
father&rsquo;s eyes, and here I stood at his command out on the
ocean in quest of a woman&rsquo;s fate in a strange country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back to America, Bob, and go straight to your Uncle
Robert at Hayesville in the Harpeth Valley. He cut me loose because
he didn&rsquo;t understand, when I married your mother out of the
French opera in Paris. When I named you Roberta for him he returned
the letter I sent but with a notice of a thousand dollars in Monroe
and Company for you. I didn&rsquo;t tell him when your mother died.
God, I&rsquo;ve been bitter! But these German bullets have cut the
life out of me and I see more plainly. Get the money and take
Nannette and the kiddie on the first boat. There&rsquo;s starvation
and&mdash;maybe worse in Paris for you. Take&mdash;the
money&mdash;and&mdash;get&mdash;to&mdash;brother Robert. God of
America&mdash;take&mdash;them and&mdash;guide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was all. I held him in my arms for a long time, while
old Nannette and small Pierre wept beside me, and then I laid him
upon his pillow and straightened the little tricolor that the good
Sister of the old gray convent in which he lay had given me to
place in his hand when he had begged for it. My mother&rsquo;s
country had meant my mother to him and he had given his life for
her and France in the trenches of the Vosges. And thus at his
bidding I was on the very high seas of adventure. From this thought
of him I was very suddenly recalled by old Nannette who came upon
the deck from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Le bon Dieu</em>,&rdquo; she sighed, as she settled
herself in her steamer chair and took out the lace knitting.
&ldquo;Is it not of a goodness that I have tied in my stocking the
necessary francs that we may land in that America, where all is of
such a good fortune? And also by my skill we have one hundred and
fifty francs above that need which must be almost an hundred of
their huge and wasteful dollars. All is well with us.&rdquo; And as
she spoke she pulled up the collar of Pierre&rsquo;s soft blue
serge blouse around his pale thin face and eased the cushion behind
his crooked small back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is that all which remains of the fifteen hundred
dollars we found to be in that bank, Nannette?&rdquo; I asked of
her with a great uncertainty. My mother&rsquo;s fortune, descended
from her father, the Marquis de Grez and Bye, and the income of my
father from his government post, had made life easy to live in that
old house by the Quay, where so many from the Faubourg St. Germaine
came to hear her sing after her fortune and children took her from
the Opera&mdash;and to go for the summers in the gray old Chateau
de Grez&mdash;but of the investment of francs or dollars and cents
I had no knowledge, in spite of my claims to be an American girl of
much progress. My mother had laughed and very greatly adored my
assumption of an extreme American manner, copied as nearly as
possible after that of my father, and had failed to teach to me
even that thrift which is a part of the dot of every French girl
from the Faubourg St. Germaine to the Boulevard St. Michel. But
even in my ignorance the information of Nannette as to the
smallness of our fortune gave to me an alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you, Mademoiselle? It was necessary that I
purchase the raiment needful to the young Marquis de Grez according
to his state, and for the Marquise his sister also. It was not to
be contemplated that we should travel except in apartments of the
very best in the ship. Is not gold enough in America even for
sending in great sums for relief of suffering? Have I not seen it
given in the streets of Paris? Is it not there for us? Do you make
me reproaches?&rdquo; And Nannette began to weep into the fine lawn
of her nurse&rsquo;s handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Nannette; I know it was of a necessity to us to
have the clothes, and of course we had to travel in the first
class. Do not have distress. If we need more money in America I
will obtain it.&rdquo; I made that answer with a gesture of
soothing upon her old shoulders which I could never remember as not
bent in an attitude of hovering over Pierre or me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Eh bien</em>!&rdquo; she answered with a perfect
satisfaction at my assumption of all the responsibilities of our
three existences.</p>
<p>And as I leaned against the deck rail and looked out into a
future as limitless as that water ahead of us into which the great
ship was plowing, I made a remark to myself that had in it all the
wisdom of those who are ignorant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best of life is not to know what will happen
next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that was so extraordinary coming from a woman that
you must pardon me for listening and making exclamation,&rdquo;
came an answer in a nice voice near at my elbow. The words were
spoken in as perfect English as I had learned from my father, but
in them I observed to be an intonation that my French ear detected
as Parisian. &ldquo;Also, Mademoiselle, are you young women of the
new era to be without that very delightful but often
danger-creating quality of curiosity?&rdquo; As I turned I looked
with startled eyes into the grave face of a man less than forty
years, whose sad eyes were for the moment lighting with a great
tenderness which I did not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the quality which will be most required of the
women of the era which is mine, is&mdash;is courage and then more
courage, Monsieur,&rdquo; I made answer to him as if I had been
discussing some question with him in my father&rsquo;s smoking room
at the Chateau de Grez, as I often came in to do with my father and
his friends after the death of my mother when the evenings seemed
too long alone. They had liked that I so came at times, and the old
Count de Breaux once had remarked that feminine sympathy was the
flux with which men made solid their minds into a unanimous
purpose. He had been speaking of that war a few weeks after
Louvaine and I had risen and had stood very tall and very haughty
before him and my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women of France are to come after this carnage to
mold a nation from what remains to them, Monsieur,&rdquo; I had
said to him as I looked straight into his face. &ldquo;Is not the
courage of women a war supply upon which to rely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God! what are the young women&mdash;such women as
she&mdash;going to do in the years that come after the deluge,
Henri of America?&rdquo; he had made a muttering question to my
father as his old eyes smouldered over me in the fire-light.</p>
<p>From the memory of the smoking room at the Chateau de Grez my
mind suddenly returned to the rail of the ship and the Frenchman
beside me, who was looking into my face with the same kindly
question as to my future that had been in the eyes of my old
godfather and which had stirred my father&rsquo;s heart to its
American depths and made him send me back to his own country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, that courage is a good weapon with which to
adventure in this America of the Grizzled Bear,
Mademoiselle,&rdquo; I found the strange man saying to me with a
nice amusement as well as interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father had shot seven grizzlies before his
twenty-first birthday. We have the skins, four of them, in the
great hall of the Chateau de Grez&mdash;or&mdash;or we did have
them before&mdash;before&mdash;&rdquo; My voice faltered and I
could not continue speaking for the tears that rose in my throat
and eyes.</p>
<p>Quickly the man at my side turned his broad shoulders so that he
should shield me from the laughing and exclaiming groups of people
upon the deck near us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before Ypres, Mademoiselle?&rdquo; he asked with tears
also in the depths of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And I am now going into
the great America with my crippled brother and his
nurse&mdash;alone. It is the land of my father and I have his
courage&mdash;I <em>must</em> have also that of a French woman. I
have it, Monsieur,&rdquo; and as I spoke I drew myself to my full,
broad-shouldered height, which was almost equal to that of the man
beside me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle, I salute the courage born of an American
who fought before the guns of the Marne and of a French woman who
sent him there!&rdquo; And as he spoke thus he removed from his
head his silk deck cap and held it at his shoulder in a way that I
knew was a salute from a French officer to the memory of a brother.
&ldquo;And also may I be permitted to present myself, as it is a
sad necessity that you travel without one from whom I might request
the introduction?&rdquo; he asked of me with a beautiful
reverence.</p>
<p>After a search in his pocket for a few seconds he at last
discovered a case of leather and presented to me a card. As he
handed it to me his color rose up under his black eyes and grave
trouble looked from between their long black lashes. I glanced down
at the card and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capitaine, le Count Armond de Lasselles,</p>
<p class="indent2">Paris,</p>
<p class="indent4">France.</p>
<p>44th Chasseurs de le Republique Francaise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Count, I know, I know why it is that you go
to America!&rdquo; I made exclamation as I clasped to my breast my
hands and my eyes shone with excitement. &ldquo;I have read it in
<em>Le Matin</em> just the day before yesterday. You go to buy
grain against the winter of starvation in the Republique. No man is
so great a financier as you and so brave a soldier, with your wound
not healed from the trenches in the Vosges. Monsieur, I salute
you!&rdquo; and I bent my head and held out my hand to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re to expect nimble wits as well as courage of
you young&mdash;shall I say <em>American</em> women?&rdquo; he
laughed as he bent over my hand. &ldquo;Now shall I not be led for
introduction to the small brother and the old nurse?&rdquo; he
asked with much friendly interest in his kind eyes.</p>
<p>It was a very wonderful thing to observe the wee Pierre listen
to the narration of Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, concerning
the actions of a small boy who had run out of a night of shot and
shell into the heart of his regiment and who had now lived five
months in the trenches with them. Pierre&rsquo;s small face is all
of France and in his heart under his bent chest burns a soul all of
France. It is as if in her death, at his birth, my beautiful mother
had stamped her race upon him with the greater emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that the small Gaston is a daredevil like is my
Bob?&rdquo; he questioned as we all made a laughter at the story of
the Count de Lasselles concerning the sortie of the small idol from
the trenches in the dead of one peaceful night to return with a
very wide thick flannel shirt of one of the <em>Boches</em>, which
he had caught hanging upon a temporary laundry line back of the
German trenches.</p>
<p>At that English &ldquo;daredevil&rdquo; word I was in my mind
again back in the old Chateau de Grez and into my own
childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young daredevil, you, hold tight to that vine until I
get a grip on your wrist, or you&rsquo;ll dash us both on the rocks
below,&rdquo; was the exact sentence with which my father bestowed
my title upon me as he hung by his heels out of a window of the old
vine-covered Chateau de Grez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is one large mistake that my <em>jeune fille</em> is
born what you call a boy in heart. <em>Helas</em>!&rdquo; sobbed my
beautiful young French mother as she regarded us from the garden
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were a boy I&rsquo;d thrash you within an inch of
your life, but as you are a girl I suppose it is permissible for me
to admire your pluck, Mademoiselle Roberta,&rdquo; said my father
as he landed me in the music room by his side while an exchange of
excited sentences went on between my mother and old Nannette in the
garden below. &ldquo;What were you doing out on that ledge, anyway?
It is more than a hundred feet to the ground and the
rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was making the hunt through Yellowstone Park that you
have related to me, father, and I prefer that you give me a
boy&rsquo;s punishment. If I have a boy&rsquo;s what you call
&lsquo;pluck,&rsquo; I should have a boy&rsquo;s what you call
&lsquo;thrashing.&rsquo; Monsieur, I make that demand. I am the
Marquise de Grez and Bye, and it may be that as you are an American
you do not understand fully the honor of the house of Grez.&rdquo;
I can remember that as I spoke I drew my ten-year old body up to
its full height, which must have been over that of twelve years,
and looked my father straight in the face with a glance of extreme
hauteur as near as was possible to that of the portrait of the old
Marquis de Grez, who died fighting on the field of Flanders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Eh, la la</em>, what is it I have produced for you,
Henri of America? It is not a proper <em>jeune fille</em>, nor do I
know what punishment to impose upon her; but with you I must
laugh,&rdquo; with which my beautiful mother from the doorway threw
herself into the arms of her young American husband and her
laughter of silver mingled with his deep laugh of a great joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Celeste; Bob is just a clear
throw-back to her great-grandmother, Nancy Donaldson, who shot two
Indians and a bear in defense of her kiddies one afternoon while my
maternal grandsire was in the stockades presiding over the council
in which was laid down the first broad draft for the formation of
the Commonwealth of Harpeth. I&rsquo;m sorry, dear, that she is so
vigorously American that she has to climb the Rocky Mountains even
here in the garden spot of France. Just now she is French enough to
be dealing with me in the terms of that jolly old boy of Flanders
fame in the hall downstairs; but cheer up, sweetheart, she&rsquo;s
a wild, daredevil American and I&rsquo;m going to send her back to
the plains as soon as she speaks her native tongue with less French
accent. Then the rest of us can be happily French forever
after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will speak as you do, my father, from this moment
forth,&rdquo; I answered him with something that was wild and
fierce and free rising in my child&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;I will not
be a <em>grande dame</em> of France. I am a woman of America. I
speak only United States.&rdquo; And I clung to my father&rsquo;s
arm as he drew me to him and embraced both my laughing mother and
me, before I was delivered to old Nannette who, with affectionate
French grumblings, led me away to the nursery for repairs.</p>
<p>The scene had become fixed in my memory, for from it had sprung
a friendship of a great closeness with my wonderful American father
whom love had chained in France. When he rode the great hunter that
had come across to him from a friend in Kentucky I demanded to
cling behind him or to sit the saddle in front of him, even at
times running at his side as long as my breath held out, to rise on
his stirrup, like the great terrifying Scotchmen do in battles, and
cling as Kentuck made flight over wall or fence. My very slim and
strong hands could not be kept from the steering wheel of his long
blue racing car, and I could bring down a hare out of the field
with any gun he possessed as unerringly as could he. I lived his
life with him hour by hour, learned to think as he thought, to
speak his easy transatlantic speech, and did equal trencher duty
with him at all times, so that muscle and brawn were packed on my
tall, broad woman&rsquo;s body with the same compactness as it was
packed upon his, by the time I had reached my twenty-first
birthday. By that time he and I had been alone together for eight
long years, for my mother had left us with tiny, misshapen Pierre
as a heart burden but with only each other to be companions.</p>
<p>The efforts of some of my mother&rsquo;s distant relatives and
friends to make me into the traditional young French Marquise had
resulted in giving to me a very beautiful <em>grande dame</em>
manner to use when I stood in need of it, which I took a care was
not too often. Because I had been born to a woman&rsquo;s estate I
considered I must manage well beautiful skirts and lacy fans, but
no oftener than was necessary, I decided. I went for the most of my
days habited in English knickerbockers under short corduroy skirts,
worn with a many-pocketed hunting blouse. On the night of my
presentation at the salon of my distant relative, the old Countess
de Rochampierre, I had to apologize to a young Russian
attach&eacute; for searching with desperation for the bit of lace
called a handkerchief, among the laces and ruffles of my evening
gown in the regions where I had been accustomed to find sensible
pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it possible that Mademoiselle Americaine hunts as
well as she makes the dance?&rdquo; was his delighted answer to my
explanation, which led into a half-hour description of a raw
morning in the field just three days before in England, where my
father and I had gone over for a week&rsquo;s hunting with Lord
Gordon Leigh at Leigholm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then some,&rdquo; I returned answer with delight at
his sympathy in my narration of the sport. I liked very well the
American slang that my father&rsquo;s friends were always glad to
teach to me, and that gave to him both amusement and delight when I
used it in his presence.</p>
<p>Also I liked well that young Russian and he came many times to
the Chateau de Grez and Bye before he left to join his regiment of
Russian Cossacks in the Carpathians.</p>
<p>And this time it was from the Carpathians that I returned to the
ship deck to find wee Pierre laughing again over the very small dog
that brought into the French trenches a very large and stupid sheep
from the flock back of the German trenches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your medal of honor, Monsieur le Capitaine; is it
permitted that I lay for a little moment just one finger upon
it?&rdquo; Pierre asked of him as the great soldier stood tall
above the steamer chair and gave to the little Frenchman the salute
of an officer.</p>
<p>Nannette sobbed into her lace and I turned my head away as the
tall man bent and laid the frail little hand against his decoration
which he wore almost entirely hidden under the pocket of his tweed
Norfolk of English manufacture. Only French eyes like wee
Pierre&rsquo;s could have seen it pinned there hidden over his
heart. I think he wore it to give him a large courage for his
mission that meant bread or starvation to so many of his
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Monsieur le Capitaine,&rdquo; I said to him with a
softness of tears in my throat, &ldquo;I would that there was some
little thing that I might do to serve France. I do so long to go
into those awful trenches with that red cross on my arm, as it is
not permitted to me to carry a gun, which I can use much better
than many men now handling them with bullets against the enemy; but
it is necessary that I obey the commands of my soldier father and
take to a safety the small Pierre.&rdquo; And as we spoke he walked
beside me to the prow of the large ship so that to us was a view of
the heavens of blue beyond which lay our America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, there is a great service which you can render
France,&rdquo; he answered me as we stopped to watch the great
white waves flung aside from the ship. &ldquo;France needs friends
in America, great powerful friends who will help her in contracting
for food and all other munitions. A beautiful woman can do much in
winning those friends. You go to your uncle, who is one of those in
power in a State in that fruitful valley of the Mississippi from
which I hope that my lieutenant, Count de Bourdon, whom I sent on
that mission, will get many mules to carry food to the hungry boys
in the trenches when mud is too deep for gasoline. Make of him and
everyone your friend and through you the friend of our struggling
country. Tell them of France, laugh with them for the joy to come
when France, all France, with Alsace and beautiful Lorraine, is
free; and make them weep with you for her struggles. Who knows but
that through you may come some wonderful strength added to your old
country from the new, whose blood runs in your veins as
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of that I will do, <em>mon Capitaine</em>. I so
enlist myself.&rdquo; And as I spoke I drew myself up unto the
greatest height possible to me. &ldquo;I will be of the army that
feeds, rather than of that which kills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu</em>, child, what is possible to you to do
has no limit. Also, I say to you, watch and be on your guard for
aught that may harm France. In America are spies. I have been
warned. Also there are those who practice deceptions in contracts.
It is for the purpose to so guard that I come to
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also will so guard,&rdquo; I made answer to my
Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, as we again came in our walk to
the side of wee Pierre and old Nannette.</p>
<h2><a id="ChII" name="ChII">CHAPTER II</a></h2>
<h3>VIVE LA FRANCE</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>And after that first day there were many hours that the
Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, spent with little Pierre and the
good Nannette, as she sat knitting always with the sun on the water
reddening her round cheeks, while I had much pleasure with many
friends who came to me upon the ship.</p>
<p>A very fine young man who was named William Raines, from the
State of Saint Louis, instructed me in several beautiful dances,
but I do not think he was held in the esteem which he deserved by
another of his American brothers by the name of Peter Scudder,
whose home was in the town of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dancing with Scudder must be like going to your
grandmother&rsquo;s funeral over the old State Road in a
rockaway,&rdquo; was the comment that Mr. William Raines made upon
his friend Mr.</p>
<p>Peter Scudder, and what Mr. Scudder said of him was of the same
unkindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raines&rsquo; dancing is extremely like Saint Louis:
delightfully rapid but crude,&rdquo; was his comment.</p>
<p>I should have been regretful of the unkindness between those two
very nice Americans but for a beautiful good to France that was
brought about by the desire of each to please me more than the
other.</p>
<p>The many ladies upon the ship had been of exceeding kindness to
me because of the loveliness of small Pierre&rsquo;s dark face and
the pity of his crooked back. Old Nannette was of a very great
popularity with all of those ladies and she spent many hours in
recounting the glories of the old Chateau de Grez and Bye and the
family which had inhabited it since the fourteenth century. So it
came about that many friends were made for France among them.</p>
<p>Now that Mr. William Raines had a very nice idea to invite in my
honor all of the ladies who were friends to me, and many
distinguished gentlemen of politics and of universities and other
large affairs, who were returning from business in Europe to more
business in America, to be present while a young boy of France, who
was among those in the steerage going to the freedom of America
with his mother who had been widowed at Ypres, sang in a very
lovely voice many French folk songs and songs of war to all
present. And at that singing many tears flowed and so much money
was put into the hands of the boy that a future for the very sad
little French family was assured in America. And I also wept. I was
taken into the embrace of all of those kind American women and
assured of so much care and affection in that land of my father,
that I felt of a very great richness in spite of the small sum of
money in the heel of Nannette&rsquo;s rough stocking. And as I
received all of these beautiful attentions I perceived the eyes of
my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, fixed upon me with a deep
gratitude and pride. It was all of a great pleasure to me except
that I did not like very well to be so distinguished by a young
man, which made the French <em>grande dame</em> in me to
shrink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mais, vive la France</em>,&rdquo; I murmured to
myself and was happy again.</p>
<p>But, alas! At the joy of all this entertainment there was one
sadness. It was of my dear friend, Mr. Peter Scudder. There was no
pleasure, but great seriousness, in his face during the whole
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind him; poor Pete&rsquo;s chewing a
grouch,&rdquo; was what his good friend Mr. William Raines answered
to my lament over his sadness. And that sadness lasted for three
days, up unto the day before we came to a sight of the Lady of
Liberty of America. Then his face found a great radiance and I
perceived that he was full of much business. I found him with a
notebook, in deep consultation with my Capitaine, the Count de
Lasselles, and then in earnest consultation with many of the other
gentlemen. I had much wonder; but at the dinner that night, which
was the last before we made the landing to America, I discovered
all of his good actions. While we were at the last of the coffee,
Mr. Peter Scudder arose and made a bow to the capitaine of the
ship, beside whom I sat, which salutation did not in any way
include me, and then turned to the direction of my Capitaine, the
Count de Lasselles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said in that very nice voice which it is
said is of Philadelphia, &ldquo;I have the honor to ask you if you
will take charge of a fund of five thousand dollars, which has been
given by the passengers of this boat, to be sent immediately to a
field hospital of France, preferably the nearest in need to the
battlefield of the Marne.&rdquo; And with no more of a speech than
that he seated himself and did not so much as make a glance in my
direction when he mentioned the battlefield on which my father had
died. I think that Mr. Peter Scudder is a very great gentleman and
I sat very still and white, with my head held high and tears rising
from the depths of France in my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My honored friends,&rdquo; answered my Capitaine, the
Count de Lasselles, as he rose from his place at the foot of the
table and stood tall and slim in the manner of a great soldier,
&ldquo;it is impossible that I say to you my gratitude for this
expression of your friendship for my country. So many dollars will
bring life and an end of suffering to many hundreds of my brave
boys, but the good will and sympathy it represents from America to
France will do still more. The fund shall go to the place you
request and I now beg to offer to you a toast that will be of an
understanding to you.&rdquo; And at that moment he raised his glass
of champagne and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the destiny of those born of American and French blood
commingled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All those present arose to their feet and drank that toast with
loving looking at me, and I did not know what I should do until
that good old gray boat capitaine patted me upon the shoulder and
said across his empty glass:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless and keep you, child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank everybody,&rdquo; I answered as I went into the
embrace of my very large lady friend from the State of Cincinnati,
and then into the embrace of the other ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been knitting all day for two months but
I&rsquo;m going to begin to sit up at night,&rdquo; sobbed the lady
from a queer Keokuk name as I took her into my embrace on account
of her extreme smallness.</p>
<p>It was at a very late hour, just before retiring, that I
ascended to the deck with my Capitaine to view the effect of a very
young moon on the waves of the ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that you think now your soldier of France has done
your command well, <em>mon Capitaine</em>?&rdquo; I asked of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most extremely well, and entirely in the mode of a woman.
Those two young men have made of themselves very noble competitors
for your favor, but remember that it is of a truth that only a
&lsquo;daredevil&rsquo; would bring together such high explosives.
I salute you!&rdquo; he made answer to me with a laugh which ended
in a sigh. &ldquo;Child, little child,&rdquo; he continued as he
bent over my hand to kiss it as he did each night before he
conducted me to the head of the stairs leading down into my cabin,
&ldquo;above all take unto yourself all that is possible of joy in
the present, for we do not know what the supply will be for the
future. Perhaps it will be like the harvests of France&mdash;burned
up in a world-conflagration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but, <em>mon Capitaine</em>, will you not dance with
me once to-night for a joy. It will be our last on the ship before
we land to-morrow. You have never danced with me and to-morrow you
are lost from me into the wilds of that English Canada.&rdquo; And
as I spoke I held out my arms to him and began to hum the music of
that remarkable Chin-Chin fox dance that I had been dancing below
with Mr. William Raines and which the band had just begun to play
again. Of course, I knew that I must be very lovely in that young
moonlight in one of the frocks that Nannette had purchased from her
very talented cousin, the <em>couturi&egrave;re</em> on Rue
Leopold, and I could see no reason why I should not make a
happiness for the great gentleman of France as well as the young
boy from Philadelphia and also the one from Saint Louis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <em>are</em> a daredevil, Mademoiselle, to propose
the dance to powder-stained Armond Lasselles, but the joy of you is
of a greatness and I feel from it a healing in the night of my
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he reached out in the moonlight and took me into his arms
and danced me along that deck with a grace that it would not be
possible for either the one from Philadelphia or the one from Saint
Louis to imitate. That nice but very ponderous lady from the State
of Cincinnati who regarded us from her steamer chair, enjoyed it as
much as did I, and she clapped her large hands as Monsieur le
Capitaine swung me around into the quietness beyond one of the tall
chimneys for smoke from the engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is good-bye, <em>mon enfant</em>, for I leave the
ship at dawn with the tug, so that I do avoid those reporters from
newspapers and the contract conspirators. I have advised Nannette
that you go to the Ritz-Carlton to await your Uncle if he be not
upon the dock. I go to the grain fields of Canada and then to the
West of America&hellip;. I would that it could be <em>au
revoir</em>. Upon a day that shall come, beautiful lady, perhaps it
will be permitted to me to&hellip; <em>Non, vive la France! A lies
vite, ch&eacute;rie _&hellip; go while I&mdash;I&mdash;</em>Vive la
France_!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And tears came across my eyes as I did his bidding and left
him&mdash;to France. In my heart was a desire to cling to him in a
great fear at being alone to care for the good Nannette and the
small Pierre, but I knew he must travel fast and far on his quest
and that for France I must let him go without&mdash;a backward
look. Would I find in the great land of America such another
gallant gentleman to care for the fate of the small Pierre and
Nannette and me? What did I know of this cruel Uncle? Nothing but
his hardness of heart. I dreaded the sight of him that I should
find upon the arrival of the ship at the dock, which would be an
answer to the letter I had sent to him to inform him of my coming,
and I spent my long night in hate of him.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the morning came more mines that exploded
for me under the waves of my life that had danced with so little
concern through the days upon the ship. A rain was falling and my
friend of France was gone from me at the beginning of day in a boat
that is called tug. Upon Nannette had fallen a rheumatism and the
small Pierre was in the midst of shivering chills when we at last
were permitted by the very unpleasant officer of America to go from
the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Helas</em>, it was all of the gold that he took from
me for an entry into this savage land where one piece of money is
as five of that of France. There remains but a few sous and a gold
piece,&rdquo; sobbed Nannette as she came from her interview with
the immigration officer while I stood beside Pierre, deposited by a
deck steward on a pile of our steamer blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it take all&mdash;all of the money to land, Nannette?
Not all!&rdquo; I cried as I stretched out my hand to her. I did
not know as I now do, that the money would have been returned to
Nannette had she waited with patience and not made a hurry of
returning to her nurslings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; were the words with which she
answered me, and for some very long moments I stood dazed and
struggled in the waves of that adventure I had thought to be
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Marquise, but here is a letter the
dock steward failed to find you to deliver,&rdquo; came in the
pleasant voice of that Mr. William Raines as he raised a very fine
hat that made him much better to look upon than the cap of the
steamer, and handed me a large letter. I took it and came with my
head out from under the wave which had dashed over me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything I can do to help you through the
customs?&rdquo; then came the nice voice of that Mr. Peter Scudder
of Philadelphia from the other side of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, with much gratitude to you both; I must wait the
arrival of my Uncle,&rdquo; I made answer to them with my head held
very high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll see you at the Ritz for tea at five as
per promise,&rdquo; said Mr. William Raines as he walked away and
left Mr. Peter Scudder, who was assisting the lady from Cincinnati
to transport her very lovely dog to a handsome car which awaited
her. She also had I promised to visit from that great Ritz-Carlton
hotel and she smiled in sweet friendliness to me as I stood with
the letter in my hand and watched all of the friends I had found
upon that ship, depart and leave me with not a place to go. I stood
for many minutes motionless and then my eyes perceived the letter
in my hand. Surely it must be opened and read. It was from the
wicked Uncle, I knew, but it might be that it was not of the
cruelty that I had expected. It would excuse him no doubt from
arrival in person for the expected greeting to his relatives,
Pierre and myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it, Bob,&rdquo; I advised myself in the language I
had heard Mr. Saint Louis use when he was forced to ask a nice
lady, who danced with disagreeable heaviness, to trot the fox with
him because of a friendship with his mother.</p>
<p>And this is the letter that my eyes read with astonishment,
while both the good Nannette and small shivering Pierre sat with
their eyes fixed upon my countenance:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;My dear nephew Robert:
<p>&ldquo;Your arrival in America at this time suits me exactly. I
need you immediately in my business. If you had been the girl,
instead of the little one, I would have had to dispose of you some
way&mdash;even murder. I have no use for women. Leave the little
crippled girl and her nurse, who I feel sure is an old fool, with
my good friend Dr. Mason Burns, of 222 South 32nd St. He has cured
more children of hip joint disease than any man in the world, and
he will straighten her out for us and we can give her away to
somebody. I&rsquo;ve written him instructions. Leave her
immediately and come down here to me on the first train. The deal
is held up without you. Enclosed is a check for a thousand dollars.
If you are like Henry you&rsquo;ll need it, but keep away from
Broadway and the women. Come on, I say, by next train.</p>
<p class="indent4">Your uncle, Robert Carruthers.</p>
Hayesville, Harpeth.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Uncle of America has come to a confusion of the sex
between Pierre and me from a careless memory and the writing of my
hand, which is of a great boldness, but not to be easily
read,&rdquo; I explained as I read the letter aloud to Pierre and
Nannette.</p>
<p>It took me just one hour by the clock, sitting there on the pile
of steamer wraps with the small Pierre in the hollow of my arm, to
explain and translate the sense of that letter to old Nannette, and
I feel sure she would have been sitting upon that spot yet
immovable rather than let me depart from her if I had not put all
of my time and force upon the picturing to her of a Pierre who
could come down with her later to me in a condition to run through
the gardens of Twin Oaks, which was the home of his American
ancestors. With that vision constantly before her she let the
porter and me insert her into a taxicab and extract her at the door
of the small private hospital of the good Dr. Burns who was to
perform the miracle for the back and hip of small and radiant
Pierre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it that I do to permit the <em>jeune
fille</em> of my beloved mistress to depart into this city of
wicked savages not attended by me? I cannot. Do not demand
it!&rdquo; were the words with which I left her arguing with that
very sympathetic and sensible doctor of America. He had not noticed
a confusion of sex was between Pierre and me and he had sent out
the check of my wicked Uncle and procured the American money for
me. Also he had given me a few directions that he appeared to think
of a great sufficiency and had ordered a taxi to be in readiness
for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Nurse,&rdquo; he said to Nannette bruskly but
not with unkindness when I had translated to him Nannette&rsquo;s
weeping protests. &ldquo;A great strapping girl like that can get
down to the Harpeth Valley all right by herself. Nobody&rsquo;s
going to eat her up, and from the size of the biceps I detect under
that chiffon I think she could give a good account of herself if
anybody tried. How like you are to what Henry was at your age,
child, God bless you! I&rsquo;d go to the station with you but
I&rsquo;ve a patient all prepared for an operation. Shall I send a
nurse with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, please, good Doctor, and good-bye,&rdquo; I said,
with a great haste as I hurriedly embraced both Nannette and the
small Pierre and departed down the broad steps into the taxi with
the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pennsylvania Station! Your train may not leave for hours,
but you can get your baggage together. Good-bye,&rdquo; said that
good Doctor as he shut the door and returned to his pursuit of
making human beings either whole or dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Roberta Carruthers, no longer Marquise of Grez
and Bye, you are in your America, and let&rsquo;s see you do some
hustling,&rdquo; as remarked that Mr. Saint Louis to Mr. Peter
Scudder at cards.</p>
<p>And while that very swift taxi conveyed me to the large station
that is as beautiful as a cathedral I did some what I name
&ldquo;tall thinking.&rdquo; What would be the result of my womanly
arrival in that State of Harpeth of my wicked Uncle? Would he be
forced to murder me as his letter had said? And if in his anger
over the mistake he had made from my letter, written in that very
bold and difficult handwriting, he should turn from me, and the
good Nannette and Pierre as well, what would I then do? All must be
enacted that a cure for Pierre be obtained. With great energy I had
been thinking, but I did not know what it was that I should do to
prevent his anger when I arrived to him as a woman until suddenly
the good Doctor Burns&rsquo; kindness in marking the resemblance of
me to my father in his extreme youth made an entry into my brain
and was received with the greatest welcome by the daredevil who
there resides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Robert Carruthers, who is no longer the
beautiful Marquise of Grez and Bye, you will be that husky nephew
to your wicked Uncle in the State of Harpeth whom he &lsquo;needs
in his business.&rsquo; What is it that you lack of a man&rsquo;s
estate save the clothes, which you have money in your pockets to
obtain after you have purchased the ticket upon the railway
train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A decision had been made and action upon it had begun in less
than a half hour after the purchase of the ticket for the State of
Harpeth had been accomplished.</p>
<p>As my father had taught me observation in hunting, I had
remarked a large shop for the clothing of men upon the Sixth Avenue
near to the station. I made my way into it and by a very nice
fiction of an invalid brother whom I was taking to the South of
America I was able to buy for a few dollars less than was in my
pocket two most interesting bags of apparel for a handsome young
man of fashion. The man who assisted me to buy was very large, with
a head only ornamented with a drapery of gray hair around the
edges, and he spoke much of what his son deemed suitable to make
appearance in the prevailing mode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s at tea at the Ritz-Carlton with a lady friend
this afternoon, and I wish you could have saw him when he left the
store to meet her,&rdquo; he said as he laid the last of the silk
scarfs and hose into one of the large flat bags I had purchased and
which he had packed as I selected. &ldquo;He had on the match to
these gray tweeds and was fitted out in lavender from the skin out.
Now what are you going to do about shoes, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I do not know, kind sir,&rdquo; I made answer with a
great perplexity. &ldquo;I think that the feet of my relative are
about the size of those I possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most women would wear shoes near the size of their
brothers&rsquo; if they didn&rsquo;t prefer to waddle and limp
along with their feet scrouged. Go over to the shoe department and
the clerk will fit you out with what you need in about two sizes
larger than you wear. If they are not right you can tell just about
what will be, and exchange &rsquo;em by special messenger.
I&rsquo;ll pack all this shipshape before you come back.&rdquo;
With which direction I left the kind man and made my way to another
of equal kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had upon my feet the shoes of my brother when in
accidents while at hunting and fishing, and I think I can ascertain
a good fitting,&rdquo; I made a falsification to the very polite
young man who stood with attention and sympathy to wait upon
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make a selection and then try one pair
on,&rdquo; he advised me.</p>
<p>And as I gave to him a fine description of the clothing I had
purchased he brought forth in accord many wonderful boots and shoes
for the riding and a walking and also for the dance. I had never
observed that the shoes of men were of such an ugliness; but when
one was upon my foot, in place of the shoe of much beauty which I
discarded, both I and the young man had a fine laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mais</em>, they are of a great comfort,&rdquo; I
further remarked. &ldquo;And they feel about as did those of my
brother, who is of a small frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if they are not right, send &rsquo;em back and
I&rsquo;ll change &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he answered with great
interest.</p>
<p>After the exchange of much money between us, the young man went
with me to the other kind old man of the white hair, and together
they made places in the two bags for the shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just seven hundred dollars all told, and the like of that
outfit couldn&rsquo;t be bought any other place of style in New
York for less than a thousand, Miss,&rdquo; remarked to me the
elderly clerk as he closed and made fast with keys the two bags.
&ldquo;Shall I send &rsquo;em special?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thank you that you call a taxi for me,
Monsieur,&rdquo; I answered, and as he had mentioned that
Ritz-Carlton Hotel, in conversation earlier, that very wicked
daredevil that resides within me awoke at attention with the large
ears of great mischief. I felt in my pocket that there was still
much gold, and the man from whom I had purchased the ticket to the
State of Harpeth had assured me that the train did not depart until
the hour of six in the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Hotel of the Ritz-Carlton,&rdquo; I commanded the
man of the taxi as he made fast the door.</p>
<p>It then transpired that one hour from the time that the young
Mademoiselle Grez, who had registered at that large hotel with all
of her luggage from the steamer while by lies her father was
represented as still engaged with the customs, entered her room,
there emerged young Mr. Robert Carruthers, who, after paying his
bill in his room had a hall boy send his bags on ahead of him to
the Pennsylvania Station while he sauntered into the tea room. I
have never again met with the wonderful dresses I left in that
hotel room. I hope the poor and beautiful domestic, who assisted me
in cutting my hair into a football shortness after the mode of a
very beautiful woman dancer which she said girls of much
foolishness in America have affected, was rewarded with them.</p>
<p>And as I stood in the center of the great room of conversation
and lights and flowers and music I again became the frightened girl
upon the dock of America and I felt as if I must flee, but at that
exact moment I beheld my Mr. William Raines of Saint Louis and my
Mr. Peter Scudder of Philadelphia seated at a table in a very
choice corner and there was a vacant chair between them. Upon each
other they were glaring and before I had a thought I started
towards them to prevent the carnage that had threatened on the
boat.</p>
<h2><a id="ChIII" name="ChIII">CHAPTER III</a></h2>
<h3>THAT MR. G. SLADE OF DETROIT</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>A number of moments in the rapid passing of the next few months
I have wondered what would have resulted if I had taken that vacant
chair between very agreeable Mr. William Raines and very proper Mr.
Peter Scudder so evidently reserved for the young, beautiful and
charming Marquise of Grez and Bye. I have decided that in about the
half of one hour young Mr. Robert Carruthers would have been
extinct and the desired and beloved Marquise in her place between
them sipping her tea while making false excuses for forgiveness. I
did not take that seat but I accepted one which a
<em>gar&ccedil;on</em> offered me next to them and did regard them
with both fear and wistfulness, also with an intense attention so
that I might acquire as much as possible from them of an American
gentleman&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the dame&rsquo;s fussing up for us to the
limit, Peter,&rdquo; observed that Mr. Saint Louis while he emptied
a glass of amber liquid and removed a cherry from its depths with
his fingers and devoured it with the greatest relish. &ldquo;Gee,
but the genuine American cocktail is one great drink! Have another,
Peter. You&rsquo;re so solemn that I am beginning to believe that
<em>belle Marquise</em> did put a dent in your old Quaker heart
after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was something in that girl&rsquo;s eyes as they
followed us, William, that no cocktail ever shaken could get out of
my mind,&rdquo; made answer the very grave Mr. Peter Scudder of
Philadelphia. &ldquo;Do you suppose her Uncle got there or that
anything happened? I wish I had waited with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, either Uncle did arrive or we&rsquo;ll see her in
the Passing Follies week after next, third from the left, in as
little as Comstock allows. When I&rsquo;ve had a good look at bare
arms my judgment connects mighty easily with bare&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>By that moment I had poised in my hand a very fragile cup of
nicely steaming tea and it was a very natural thing that I should
hurl its contents in the face of that Mr. William Raines of the
country of Saint Louis.</p>
<p><em>Voila</em>! What happened? Did I stay to fight the duel with
that, what I know now to call a cad, and thus be put back into the
person of the Marquise de Grez and Bye for a wicked Uncle to
murder. I did not. I placed upon the table two large pieces of
money and I lost myself in the crowd of persons who had risen and
gathered to sympathize with poor Mr. Saint Louis. No one had
remarked my escape, I felt sure, as I had been very agile, but as I
sauntered out into the entresol of the Hotel of Ritz-Carlton, to
which I had given so great a shock in its stately tea room, a
finger was laid upon my arm in its gray tweed coat. I turned and
discovered a very fine and handsome woman standing beside me and in
her hand she had a book of white paper with also a pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sitting just back of Willie Raines and I heard what
he was saying about some woman, whom he and Peter Scudder had met
on the boat over, not keeping her appointment with them. Peter is
of the Philadelphia elect and nobody knows why he consorts with the
gay Willie. I saw them come off the boat together this morning and
I knew that the whole Scudder Meeting House would be in a glum over
their being together. Would you mind telling me just why you soused
your tea into his face? It would make a corking story for my
morning edition. Did you know them or did you know the lady or did
you do it to be launcelotting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it must have been for the third of those reasons,
Madam, but I am not sure that I know the word you use,&rdquo; I
answered with much caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Launcelot, you know, the boy that was always fussing
around over injured women, in Tennyson or somewhere, just for a
love of &rsquo;em that was always perfectly proper. Nice of him but
not progressive. Say, do you mind sitting down in a quiet corner of
the tea room and telling me all about it? Are you French or Russian
or Brazilian, and do you believe in women, or is it just because
you like &rsquo;em that you threw the tea? I&rsquo;ve got a
suffrage article to do and I believe you&rsquo;d make a good
headline, with your militant tea throwing. Want to tell me all
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just one hour before going to the State of
Harpeth, many miles from here, Madam,&rdquo; I made answer with a
great politeness. &ldquo;I thank you but I must make my
regrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can find out all I want to know about you in five
minutes. Just come sit down with me and be a good boy. Do you want
to give me your name? I wish you really were <em>somebody</em> that
had given Willie that tea fight.&rdquo; And while making
protestations and remonstrances I was led again into that tea room
and seated at a great distance from the table which had been
occupied by that Mr. William Raines and Mr. Peter Scudder, who had
now departed. &ldquo;If you really were some big gun it would kill
Willie dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Madam, permit me to present myself to you as Robert
Carruthers, Marquis de Grez and Bye, from Paris on my way to visit
my Uncle, General Robert Carruthers, of the State of Harpeth. I
would very willingly by information or a sword kill that Mr.
William Raines of Saint Louis and I regret
that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo; At the beginning of my sentence I had
drawn myself up into the attitude of the old Marquis of Flanders in
the hall of the ruined Chateau de Grez, but when I had got to the
point&mdash;of, shall I say, my own sword?&mdash;I was forced to
collapse and I could feel my knees under the tea table begin to
shake together and huddle for their accustomed and now missing
skirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine and dandy,&rdquo; answered the nice
woman as she began to write rapidly upon the blank paper. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;d drawn fifty swords on Willie and he had knocked you
down with the butt end of his teaspoon I&rsquo;d have put Willie on
the run in my write-up. Willie has handed me several little blows
below the belt that I don&rsquo;t like. Pretends not to have met
me, when Peter Scudder&rsquo;s own sister, whom I knew at the
settlement, introduced him to me; and what he did to Mabel Wright,
our cub on weddings&mdash;Oh, well, Mabel is another story.
Now&mdash;that copy is ready to turn in when I pad it. I wonder if
I will get a favor from the manager or be turned out of the tea
room permanently for reporting a fight as aristocratic as this in
the sacred halls of the Ritz-Carlton. I&rsquo;d bet my shoe lacings
that fifty people come here every afternoon for a week hoping it
will happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do like this America, whose movement is so
rapid,&rdquo; I made remark as I set down my second cup of tea for
the afternoon, this one emptied into my depths instead of the face
of Mr. Saint Louis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, too,&rdquo; returned my new-found
friend with a laugh as she again wrote a word or two on the nice
white paper. Then she placed her elbow upon the table, leaned her
very firm cheek on her hand, and regarded me with fine and honest
and sympathetic eyes. &ldquo;I wonder what America is going to do
to a beautiful boy like you. I&rsquo;m glad that you are going to
beat it to the tall timbers of the Harpeth Valley. There are women
in New York who would eat you up alive. There&rsquo;s La Frigeda,
alias Maggie Sullivan from Milwaukee, over there devouring you with
her eyes at this moment, and that pretty little Stuyvesant Blaine
debutante hasn&rsquo;t taken her eyes off of you long enough to eat
her spiced ice. I know &rsquo;em both and could land something from
either one if I introduced you in your title and very beautiful
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg a pardon of you that I have not the time to
have an introduction to your friends,&rdquo; I exclaimed with a
very true regret, because I did like that very nice woman and would
have liked much to have brought advantage to her. &ldquo;In less
than an hour I must &lsquo;beat&rsquo; to those &lsquo;tall timbers
of Harpeth&rsquo; you mention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of the State of Harpeth, I don&rsquo;t know as
you&rsquo;ll be so safe after all, young friend, if that is any
sample of the variety of women that flower in that classic land of
the cotton and the magnolia which I met at Mrs. Creed Payne&rsquo;s
war baby tea the other afternoon,&rdquo; mused my fine friend as I
paid the <em>gar&ccedil;on</em> for the very good tea. &ldquo;She
is in high-up political circles down there in Old Harpeth and from
the bunch of women she was with I make a guess she is taking an
interest in war contracts. She was with that Mrs. Benton, who
pulled off that spectacular deal for desiccated soups for Greece
the other day. My stomach is too delicate to feed soldiers dried
dog and rotten cabbage melted down into glue in a can, but they may
like the idea if not the soup. Anyway, the woman was a beauty, so
don&rsquo;t you let her get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not entirely understand you, my dear Madam, and I
wish that I might have many days to talk with you about these
American customs,&rdquo; I said as I put into my pocket the
exchange money handed to me by the <em>gar&ccedil;on</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is not exactly an American custom I have been
putting you next to, and I guess I&rsquo;m patriotically glad that
you don&rsquo;t entirely understand. Now, I&rsquo;m going to put
you on the train for Old Harpeth and kiss you good-bye for your
mother. I&rsquo;m not trusting Frigeda, and she&rsquo;s lingering.
Come on if your train leaves at six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while she spoke, my interesting and fine woman rose and
allowed me to assist her into her gray coat of tweed that was very
like to mine.</p>
<p>It was with regret that I parted from that lady at the door of
the taxicab that had been called for her, and I bent over and
kissed her hand, the first woman that Mr. Robert Carruthers had
ever so saluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, boy! Remember, the tall timbers of Harpeth are
best. Run right down and get a Southern belle and beauty to settle
down and have a dozen babies for you, just like &lsquo;befo&rsquo;
the war.&rsquo; Good-bye! I&rsquo;ll send you down a paper
to-morrow. I don&rsquo;t suppose the New York journals ever
penetrate the Harpeth Valley. Good-bye again.&rdquo; And then my
friend was gone, leaving me once more alone in New York and very
shy of those tweed trousers, which I immediately put with me into
another taxicab which was directed to the Pennsylvania Station.</p>
<p>At that Pennsylvania Station I remembered to send to my wicked
Uncle an announcement by telegram of my arrival to him and then I
got upon the train just in time for its departure.</p>
<p>I have remarked that life is like high waves of fate that break
in sparkling white crests over buried mines, and I am now led to
believe that many of those mines are but the habitation of mermaids
of much mischief. Are all ripples on life due to women at the
bottom of the matter? I do not know, but it would seem true from
the things that immediately began to befall me. And was it not I, a
woman who was called daredevil, who began it all?</p>
<p>These Pullman cars of America in which to travel great
distances, are very remarkable for their many strange adventures,
and I was very much interested but also perturbed when the black
<em>gar&ccedil;on</em> placed my bag and overcoat upon the floor at
the feet of a very prim lady and left me to stand uncomfortably in
the aisle before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your seat, sir, upper five,&rdquo; he said, and departed
with my fifty centimes, which is called a dime in America.</p>
<p>In the little division which I could see was marked five were
two nice seats that were to each other face to face, but it
appeared that neither of them was vacant for Mr. Robert Carruthers.
On one the lady sat with very stiff black silk skirts projecting
from her sides, as did her thin elbows also in the stiffness of
white linen. Beside her, occupying the rest of her seat, was a hat
with large black bows of equal stiffness with the rest of the
lady&rsquo;s apparel and disposition not to be friendly. On the
seat opposite, which from the nature of my ticket and the case I
should have supposed belonged to me, were piled two large bundles,
a shiny black bag, a black silk coat, also stiff like the lady, an
umbrella, two magazines and a basket of fruit. No place was
apparent for me or my bags or my overcoat. It seemed as if it would
be best for me to stand in the middle of the car all the way to the
State of Harpeth so that the lady&rsquo;s stiffness be not
disarranged. I did not know what I should do, and my knees began
again to feel weak in that gray tweed and to be cold for their
accustomed skirts, but the lady looked out of the window and said
not a single word. I did not have any convenient cup of tea in my
hand to throw in that lady&rsquo;s face in a manner that would not
be permitted a gentleman, but if I had had the very lovely
lorgnette that has descended to me from my Great Grandmamma, the
wife of the old Flanders grandsire, I would have settled the matter
with very little trouble in an entirely ladylike manner. As it was,
I did not know what to do but stand and then stand longer. Just at
the moment when I began to feel that I would either be forced to
forget that I was a gentleman or to faint as a lady, a very nice
man touched me on the elbow and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just drop your bag on her feet and come into the smoker.
She&rsquo;s got your game beat,&rdquo; and he passed on down the
aisle of that car. I acted upon that very kind advice and I am glad
that from the weight of the bag I got at least a small action from
the stiff lady if only a groan and a glare. Also I should have been
grateful that she had so discourteously treated me so that I was
fortunate to receive the attention of Mr. George Slade of Detroit
as my first experience in American manhood.</p>
<p>That Mr. Slade of Detroit is a man of remarkable adventures, and
he related to me many of them as he sat with me in the place
reserved for the smoking of gentlemen. They were all about ladies
who resided in the different towns to which he traveled in the
pursuit of selling cigars, and he called them all by the name of
&ldquo;skirts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Mr. Dago, there is a skirt in Louisville,
Kentucky, that is such a peach that you&rsquo;d call for the cream
jug on sight. It would pay you to stop off and see her. She&rsquo;s
on the level all right, but any friend that took a line from me
would be nuts to her. See?&rdquo; And he bestowed upon me a
pleasant wink from his eye. To that I made no response. I could
make none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Robert Carruthers,&rdquo; I had said to myself
at the beginning of the first story of &ldquo;skirts,&rdquo;
&ldquo;you will find yourself obliged to be in the presence of men
as one of their kind and not throw scalding tea in their faces when
they speak of ladies. You are of a great ignorance about the brute
that is known as man and you must learn to know him as you do the
wild hog in hunting.&rdquo; But even for the sake of a larger
education I could not remain, and I fled from that Mr. Slade of
Detroit in one half hour back to the arms of the stiff lady. But
when I arrived there I found she had had me removed from her as far
as possible to the other end of the car, where I found my bags
deposited beside one marked &ldquo;G. Slade, Detroit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took the liberty of transferring you here above the other
gentleman, sir. The lady is nervous,&rdquo; said the conductor of
the car as he handed me another ticket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, old top,&rdquo; said that Mr. G. Slade as he stood
beside us, having followed. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t enjoy
sleeping rock-a-bye-baby we can put our togs up and you can bunk in
with me. I&rsquo;m not nervous.&rdquo; And with a glance at the
very stiff black silk back in the front of the car he made a laugh
that I could not prevent myself from sharing. It is then that the
delicacy of a woman is so easily corrupted?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, conductor, but upper nine is engaged
for my son who is to get on at Philadelphia. I must have him just
opposite my daughter and me. We are nervous.&rdquo; And as the
large and pathetic lady across the aisle from number nine spoke in
a most timid voice, that Mr. G. Slade gave one glance at the
daughter of whom she spoke, who also must have weighed a great many
litre, or what you call in America, pounds, and fled back to the
smoking apartment.</p>
<p>It was a very funny sight to behold that small conductor stand
with my large bags and overcoat and look around at that car full of
ladies for a place in which to deposit me and them, which was not
previously occupied by some female of great nervousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, I will have to use the upper of this
section,&rdquo; he finally turned and said to the occupant of the
number of seven with a very fine determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, conductor; let me remove my hat and
coat,&rdquo; came back the answer in a voice of very great
sweetness as the conductor deposited me and my bags down in front
of the most beautiful lady in all America, I am sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for much graciousness, Madam,&rdquo; I said,
keeping those gray tweed knees straight out in front of me and very
still to prevent trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, sir; I only bought the lower half of this
section. I am not at all <em>nervous</em>,&rdquo; and I could see
her mouth that was curled like the petals of an opening rose
tremble from a mischief as she regarded the stiff black silk back
in the front of the car and the two huge females on our right whose
son and brother was to arrive in Philadelphia for their
protection.</p>
<p>An equally gay mischief rose in my eyes and responded to that in
hers as I responded also by word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For which also let us be in gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many times in the months that followed have I thought of the
lure of the laughing mischief in those eyes that were like
beautiful blue flowers set in crystal, and how they were to lead me
on into the strange land of men in search of those forbidden
fruits. They were the first to offer me affection, excepting
perhaps my fine reporter woman with the paper and pencil.</p>
<p>And from that moment on I did very much enjoy myself in
conversation with that Madam Mischief, while we together did watch
the retirement of all of the persons in the train. She had many
funny remarks to make and made me merry with them so that the hour
of eleven o&rsquo;clock had arrived before we had summoned the very
black male chamber-maid to turn our seats into beds. All others
were in sleep that was a confusion of sound from everywhere and we
must stand in the aisle while the beds were being abstracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I take your bag into the dressing room, sah?&rdquo;
said the black male chamber-maid as if to intimate that I should
leave the aisle free for his operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks, yes,&rdquo; I answered him. &ldquo;Good
night, Madam, and to you again much gratitude for the happiness of
an evening,&rdquo; and with all sincerity I directed Mr. Robert
Carruthers to bend over her very white hand and kiss it with much
fervor that was resulted from the loneliness of the poor Marquise
of Grez and Bye, who was but a girl in a strange and large land,
although habited in trousers and coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a dear boy,&rdquo; she made answer to me with an
equal affection as she disappeared into the curtains of her small
room. Then I departed to that room reserved for the disrobing of
gentlemen. It was without occupation and I opened my large bag and
procured the very beautiful silk night robing that the kind man had
sold to me that afternoon. It was in two pieces that very much
resembled the costume in which gentlemen play tennis, only more
ornamented by silk embroidery and braid and buttons. I was
regarding them with joy when into the small room came that Mr. G.
Slade of Detroit. He was appareled in garments of the same cut only
of a very wide red stripe, his hair was very much in confusion and
he had a bottle in his hand in which was a liquid the color of
cognac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only been awake for two hours listening to
that peach of a skirt trying to make you fuss her a bit, and I
thought I would bring you a nip to pick you up after your fight.
Gee, it is as I suspected. You are off on a wedding tango and that
makes you cold to all wiles! My son, for a wedding garment that
thing you have in your hand is a winner. I can&rsquo;t sleep in
silk myself because it makes me feel like a wet dog, but
you&rsquo;ll be so beautiful in them that the bride will be jealous
of you and say that even if you are so pretty now you will fade
early or that you buy your complexion at the corner emporium. Go
on, put &rsquo;em on, or was you just looking at &rsquo;em for
pleasure and going to save &rsquo;em by sleeping &lsquo;as
is&rsquo;? Me, I always undress to the skin, but some
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was just looking at them with pleasure,&rdquo;
I made haste to answer that Mr. G. Slade of Detroit. &ldquo;When
upon travels I always fear to disrobe myself. I think that I will
now retire,&rdquo; and with a haste that made my hands tremble I
replaced the sleeping garments in the large bag and prepared to
flee down the aisle to the sleeping apartment in which was the
protection of another woman&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even a nip before you go?&rdquo; he asked me as he
held the large bottle to his lips and threw back his head for a
gurgling down his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, with much gratitude, and good night,&rdquo; I
answered as I rapidly departed with my cheeks in a flame of scarlet
and a fear in my heart. In my flight I passed by that number of
seven and came very near opening the curtains of the number of five
and precipitating myself upon the bayonets of black taffeta that
stood firm from a hat so placed as to bar my intrusion. From that
accident I turned and sought the kind black male chamber-maid with
a request that he show me how to insert myself into the right place
for sleeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here, Boss. Climb up on these little steps and then
hand me down your shoes. Soft now; I think the lady am
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, and I&rsquo;m not nervous,&rdquo; I heard a
laugh of mischief come from behind a second and short green
curtain, that veils the lower of the sleeping shelves, just as I
fell onto my shelf above and lay with a panting of relief.</p>
<h2><a id="ChIV" name="ChIV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>
<h3>THE IMPOSSIBLE UNCLE ROBERT</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; I made remark to myself after I had with
difficulty removed the tweed coat and the tweed trousers and neatly
folded them against ugly wrinkles of to-morrow, &ldquo;you must
become a sport and not climb down there and tell that other woman
the truth of your lady&rsquo;s estate and ask her to comfort you
with affection. You were born a daredevil and you must remember
those two Indians and a bear that the Grandmamma Madam Donaldson
murdered for safety for herself and her children. That Mr. G. Slade
is just one bear and he&rsquo;s not as dangerous to you as if you
wore &lsquo;skirts&rsquo; anyway. And, also, if you are brave and
propitiate the wicked Uncle, in just a few months you can travel to
where the lovely lady with the blue flower eyes resides, of whom in
the morning you must get the address of home, and can then make
confession to her and know the joy of having her sisterly embraces
that seem of so much sweetness to you now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose it is that she arises in the night and leaves
the train for her home!&rdquo; I said to myself as I suddenly sat
up in the dark and precipitated my head against the roof of the
sleeping shelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will call down to her and ask the one simple
question,&rdquo; I made answer to myself. Then I reached down my
head over the edge of my shelf and called very softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; came a soft question in answer and I felt
that she arose and brought her beautiful head which had the odor of
violets in the waves so heavy and black, up very near to mine. I
could feel a comfort from her breath on my cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in fear, Madam, that you should leave the train
before I am awake,&rdquo; I said in a voice under my breath.
&ldquo;I do not want that I lose you into this great
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not easily lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am desolated with loneliness and I must know where it
is that you leave the train, immediately, so that I may
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Hayesville, Harpeth, you ridiculous boy. Now
don&rsquo;t disturb me again. Go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I sank back on my pillow, happy with a great relief, I
thought I heard two laughs in the darkness, one in a tone of silver
from beneath me and one of the sound of a choke from opposite me
where was reposed that Mr. G. Slade of Detroit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good chance for you, Robert, that you go to sleep
your first night in America with the sound of a nice laugh from two
persons of kindness towards you, one of whom is to be with you for
a friend in the same&mdash;what was it the gray lady with the
pencil and paper called it?&mdash;&lsquo;tall timbers of Old
Harpeth&rsquo; where all is of such strangeness to you.&rdquo; And
with this remark to myself I fell asleep, &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; I
think it was that Mr. G. Slade of Detroit called my state of not
being disrobed further than trousers and coat.</p>
<p>After many months in which came to me cruel pain and a long hard
fight for the honor of my beloved, I cannot but remember that
feeling of gratitude that came over me as I went into sleep on that
narrow shelf under which lay the beauty of that Madam Patricia
Whitworth.</p>
<p>In the eight years that I had become all of life to my father we
had made many travels into distant lands and had seen all of beauty
that the Old World had to offer seekers after it, but nowhere had I
seen the majestic wonder of this, his own land, that I beheld pass
by like a series of great pictures wrought by a master. All of the
morning I could but sit and gaze with eyes that sometimes dimmed
with tears for him as faster and faster I was carried down into his
own land of the Valley of Harpeth, which he had given up for love
of my Mother and from the cruelness of my wicked Uncle who would
not welcome her to his home. When the great Harpeth hills, in their
spring flush from the rosiness of what I afterwards learned was
their honeysuckle and laurel, shot with the iridescent fire of the
pale yellow and green and purple of redbud and dogwood and maple
leaf, all veiled in a creamy mist over their radiance, came into
view, as we arrived nearer and nearer to Hayesville my hand went
forth and grasped closely the hand of Madam Whitworth. That Mr. G.
Slade had left the train before my awakening and I felt relief from
the absence of his eyes and could express to the beautiful lady the
joy that was in my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the small homes in the valley, Madam, with the sheep
and cattle and grain and children surrounded, they need never fear
the fire of shell and the roar of the cruel guns. This valley is a
fold in the garment across the breast of the good God Himself and
it has His cherishing. Is it that there will be a home for me in
its peace and for the small Pierre and the old and faithful
Nannette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A home and&mdash;and other things, boy&mdash;when you ask
for them,&rdquo; she answered me with a very beautiful look of
affection that while it pleased me greatly also made for me an
unreasonable embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that you think I will obtain the affection of my
Uncle, the General Robert Carruthers, Madam Whitworth?&rdquo; I
asked of her with a great wistfulness, for I had told her of his
summons to me and she knew already the story of his hardness of
heart against my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The General is a very difficult person,&rdquo; she made
answer to me, and I saw that softness of her beautiful mouth become
as steel as she spoke of him. &ldquo;To a woman he is impossible,
as I have found to my cost, but all men adore him and follow him
madly, so I suppose his attitude towards them is different from his
attitude towards women. My husband and I disagree utterly about the
General. In fact, the old gentleman and I are at daggers&rsquo;
points just now and I am afraid&mdash;afraid that he will make it
difficult for you to be&mdash;be friends with me as I&mdash;I want
you to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither the General Carruthers nor any man, Madam,
dictates in matters of the heart to the Marquise de&mdash;that is,
to Robert Carruthers of Grez and Bye, if that is the way I must so
name myself now,&rdquo; I answered in the manner of the old Marquis
of Flanders, tinged with the <em>grande dame</em> manner of the
beautiful young Marquise of Grez and Bye whom I had murdered and
left in that room of the great hotel of Ritz-Carlton in New
York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be delicious to watch his face as you and I
alight from this train together, boy. It will be worth the trouble
of this hurried trip to New York to be introduced to a person who
disappeared suddenly in a tug boat in the open ocean when he should
have landed at the docks with the propriety that would have been
expected of him.&rdquo; And as she spoke I could see that something
had happened in New York which had brought much irritation to the
beautiful Madam Whitworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem that it is one of the customs of these
great ships to send out passengers from them in those very funny
small tug boats,&rdquo; I remarked as I leaned forward to catch a
last fleeting glimpse of a lovely girl standing in the doorway of
an ancient farmhouse, giving food to chickens so near the course of
the railroad train that it would seem we should disperse them with
fright. &ldquo;I wept when I must see my good friend, Capitaine,
the Count de Lasselles, depart from our ship in one of those tug
boats. It was a pain in my breast that he must leave me to go into
the wildness of Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then he went to Canada first?&rdquo; exclaimed that
Madam Whitworth as she leaned back on her seat as if relieved from
some form of a great anxiety about the departure of that Capitaine,
the Count de Lasselles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that you are also a friend of my Capitaine?&rdquo;
I demanded with a great eagerness of pleasure if it should be
so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the beautiful Madam
Whitworth. &ldquo;I was speaking of my own friend who might have
taken a Canadian line instead of the American. She is so careless
about instructions. Now look; we are beginning to wind down into
the very heart of the Harpeth Valley, and by the time you make very
tidy that mop of hair you have on your head and I powder my nose,
we will be in Hayesville to face the General in all of his glory.
Mind you kiss my hand so he can see you! I want to give him that
sensation in payment of a debt I owe him. Now do go and smooth the
mop if it takes a pint of water to do it. That New York tailor has
turned you out wonderfully, but even those very square English
tweeds do not entirely disguise the French cavalier. You&rsquo;re a
beautiful boy and the girls in Hayesville will eat you up&mdash;if
the General ever lets them get a sight of you&mdash;which he
probably won&rsquo;t. Now go to the mop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For many years, since the lonely day just after the death of my
mother, when my father took me into the furthest depths of his sad
heart and told me of his exile from the place in which he had been
born, and about the elder brother who had hated my beautiful
mother, who hated all women, I had spent much time erecting in my
mind a statue that would be the semblance of that wicked and cruel
Uncle. I had taken every disagreeable feature of face and body that
I had beheld in another human, or in a picture, or had read of in
the tales of that remarkable Mr. Dickens, who could so paint in
words a monstrous person to come when the lights are out to haunt
the darkness, and had carefully patched them one upon another so as
to make them into an ideal of an old Uncle of great wickedness. On
that very ship itself I had beheld a man, who came upon the lower
deck from the engine, who had but one eye and a great scar where
that other eye should have been placed. Immediately my image of the
General Robert Carruthers lost one of the wicked eyes I had given
him from out the head of the stepfather who did so cruelly stare at
the poor young David Copperfield, and became a man with only one
eye which still held the malevolence that was hurled at that small
David. And with this squat, crooked, evil image of the General
Robert Carruthers in my heart I alighted from the train into the
City of Hayesville, which is the capital of the great American
State of Harpeth. The black man had swung himself off with my bags
and that of the beautiful Madam Whitworth, who with me was the last
of the passengers to descend from the steps of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Jeff!&rdquo; exclaimed my so lovely new friend as
she raised her veil for a very seemly kiss from a tall and quite
broad gentleman with a very wide hat and long mustachios that
dropped far down with want of wax that it is the custom to use for
their elevation in France, as I well know from my father&rsquo;s
wrathy remarks to his valet if he made a too great use of it upon
his. &ldquo;And this is General Carruthers&rsquo; nephew who came
down on the train with me. My husband, Mr. Carruthers of Grez and
Bye!&rdquo; with which introduction she confronted me with the
gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to know you, young man; glad to know you,&rdquo; he
answered as he took my hand and gave it an embrace of such vigor
that I almost made outcry. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the General over
there looking for you. Come to see us sometime. Come on,
Patsy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Carruthers. I&rsquo;ll see you soon,&rdquo;
said the beautiful Madam Whitworth as she held out her hand to me.
&ldquo;Do it now; there comes the General! Quick, kiss my
hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bent and did as she bade me and as I had promised her to do,
and as I raised myself she slipped away quickly after her husband
with a salutation of great coolness to a person over my shoulder
and a &ldquo;How do you do, General Carruthers&rdquo; remark as she
went.</p>
<p>Instantly I turned and faced the materialization of the ogre it
had taken me years to build up into my wicked Uncle. And what did I
see?</p>
<p>My eyes looked straight into eyes of the greatest kindness and
wisdom I had ever before beheld, and it was with difficulty I
restrained myself from flinging myself and my suit of English tweed
straight into the strong arms and burying my head on the broad deep
chest that confronted me as the huge old gentleman, with as perfect
a mop of white hair as is mine of black, rioting over his large
head, towered over me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gallivanting young idiot, where did you pick up that
dimity?&rdquo; he demanded of me as he laid a large hand with long
strong fingers on my shoulders and gave me a slight shake.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me it was over Pat Whitworth you had that
ruckus at the Ritz-Carlton day before yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur, it was not,&rdquo; I answered, looking him
straight in the eyes and feeling as if I was looking into kind eyes
that I had seen close to me forever in the old convent in France,
and as I spoke I could not help it that I raised my arm in its
covering of a man&rsquo;s tweed and let my woman&rsquo;s fingers
grasp one of the long fingers on my shoulder and cling to it as I
had done other long fingers just like them that had guided my first
footsteps down the sunny garden paths of the old Chateau de
Grez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your Uncle Robert, sonny, and don&rsquo;t you
ever forget that, sir,&rdquo; he answered as he gave me another
shake and I could see a longing for the embrace, which I so
desired, in his keen eyes that had softened with a veil of mist in
the last second. &ldquo;Lord, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re not a
woman! And from now on just stop knowing the creatures
exist&mdash;Pat Whitworth and her kind. None of that tea-throwing
in Hayesville, sir! We&rsquo;ve got work to do to put out a
fire&mdash;fire of dishonor and devastation. No time for
tea-fighting here. Come on to my car over there; we&rsquo;ve no
time to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that you say about that throwing of tea which
occurred only the day before yesterday in the City of New York many
hundreds of miles from here? How did that knowledge arrive here, my
Uncle Robert?&rdquo; I questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Associated Press, sir. The greatest power in this
America. Associated Press! Full account, you and me, titles and
all, printed in this afternoon&rsquo;s paper. Any money left of
that thousand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my Uncle Robert,&rdquo; I faltered. &ldquo;It was
necessary that I spend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me about it. I sent it to you so you
could get as much as possible out of your system. The hussies!
I&rsquo;ve got work for you to do here. Forget &rsquo;em! Hop
in!&rdquo; And he motioned me into a very large blue touring car
that stood beside the station platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive to the Governor&rsquo;s Mansion and don&rsquo;t
sprout grass under your wheels,&rdquo; he commanded the black
chauffeur. &ldquo;The Governor&rsquo;s Mansion, private door on
Sixth Street.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>&ldquo;HERE&rsquo;S MY BOY, GOVERNOR&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>And it was en route to the mansion of the Gouverneur of the
State of Harpeth that my Uncle, the General Robert, did enlighten
me as to the urgent need of me in his affairs of business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a question of mules, sir, and of a dishonor to the
State that I&rsquo;m going to prevent if my hot old head is laid
low in doing it, as it probably will be if I get into the ruckus
with Jefferson Whitworth that now threatens. They have insinuated
themselves into the confidence of Governor Faulkner until they have
made it well-nigh impossible for him to see the matter except as
they put it. They will get his signature to the rental grant of the
lands, make a get-away with the money and let the State crash down
upon his head when it finds out that he has been led into bringing
it and himself into dishonor. Why, damn it, sir, I&rsquo;d like to
have every one of them, especially Jeff Whitworth, at the end of a
halter and feed him a raw mule, hoof and ears. I&rsquo;m probably
going to be done to death all alone before the pack of wolves, but
I&rsquo;m going to die hard&mdash;for Bill Faulkner, who holds in
his hand the honor of his State and my State, I&rsquo;ll die
hard!&rdquo; And he spoke the words with such a fierceness that his
white mustache, which was waxed with the propriety of the world,
divided like crossed silver swords beneath his straight nose with
its thin and trembling nostrils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be that I can help you protect this honor of the
Gouverneur Faulkner and the State of Harpeth, will it not, my Uncle
Robert?&rdquo; I asked with a great anxiety. &ldquo;If you must
fall on the field of honor it will be the glory of Robert
Carruthers of Grez and Bye to fall beside you, sir. I am a very
good sport, my father has said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul, how like Henry you are, boy!&rdquo;
exclaimed my Uncle, the General Robert, and he did lay one of his
long and very strong arms across my shoulder and give to me the
embrace for which I had so longed; but for not enough time for me
to yield myself to it. &ldquo;Henry always wanted to tag
&lsquo;Brother Bob,&rsquo; and he too&mdash;would&mdash;have
died&mdash;fighting for me&mdash;at my side. I&rsquo;ve been
hard&mdash;and when I heard of his death&mdash;I wanted you, boy, I
wanted you more&mdash;Now what do you mean, sir, by making me
forget for one moment the fix Bill Faulkner and I are in?&rdquo;
And my Uncle, the General Robert, gave to me a good shake as he
extracted his very large white handkerchief and blew upon his nose
with such power that the black chauffeur looked around at us and
made the car to jump even as he and I had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those mules that it would be your wish to feed to
that Mr. Jeff Whitworth, my Uncle Robert, will you not tell me
further about them? In Paris it is said that they are a very good
food when made fat after being old or wounded in the army. I
have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, sir. If you&rsquo;ve had to eat mule in
Paris don&rsquo;t tell me about it. My constitution wouldn&rsquo;t
stand that, though during our war, just before Vicksburg, I
ate&mdash;but we won&rsquo;t go into that either. Now this is the
situation, as much as a lad from the wilds of Paris could
understand it. The French Government wants five thousand mules by
the fall of the year, and there are no such mules in the world as
this State produces. They are sending a man over here to try to
make a deal with the State of Harpeth to purchase the mules from
private breeders, graze them on the government lands and deliver
them in a lot for shipment the first of August at Savannah. There
is no authority on the statute book for the State to make such a
deal, but Jeff Whitworth has fixed up a sort of contract, that
wouldn&rsquo;t hold water in the courts, by which the Governor of
the State, Williamson Faulkner, grants the grazing rights on the
State&rsquo;s lands to a private company of which he is to be a
member, which, in a way, guarantees the deal. They&rsquo;ve made
him believe it to be a good financial thing for the State and he
can&rsquo;t see that they are going to buy cheap stock, fatten it
on a low rate from the State and hand it over to the French
Government at a fancy rake-off&mdash;and then leave him with the
bag to hold when the time for settlement and complaint comes. There
is a strong Republican party in this State and they&rsquo;re
keeping quiet, but year after next, when Bill Faulkner comes up for
re-election, downright illegality will be alleged, and he will be
defeated in dishonor and with dishonor to the State. I am his
Secretary of State and I&rsquo;m going to save him if I can. And
you are going to help me, sir!&rdquo; And as he spoke my Uncle, the
General Robert, gave to me a distinguished shake of the hand that
made my pride to rise in my throat, which gave to my speaking a
great huskiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will help in the rescue of the honor of that Gouverneur
Bill Faulkner, my Uncle Robert, with the last breath in my body,
and I will also assist to feed mule to that Mr. Jefferson
Whitworth, though not to his beautiful wife whom I do so much
admire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it; she&rsquo;ll have to eat mule the
first one. She&rsquo;s at the Governor day and night with her
wiles, and in my mind it&rsquo;s her dimity influence that is
making him see things with this slant. They say she put her brand
on him in early youth. He&rsquo;s the soul of honor but what chance
has a man&rsquo;s soul-honor got when a woman wants to cash it in
for a fortune with which to lead a gay life? None! None,
sir!&rdquo; And the countenance of my Uncle, the General Robert,
became so fierce that it was difficult to find words to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my Uncle Robert, is it that a woman would make a
cheat in giving the mule animal of not sufficient strength to carry
food to poor boys of France in the trenches when there is too much
mud for gasoline!&rdquo; I exclaimed with a great horror from
knowledge given me by my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just exactly what she is trying to do, boy. Let those
poor chaps with guns in their hands to defend her civilization as
well as theirs, die for want of a supply train hauled by reliable
mules when unreliable gasoline fails. That&rsquo;s what women are
like.&rdquo; And as he spoke I perceived the depth of dislike that
was in the heart of my Uncle, the General Robert, for all of
womankind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some women who would not so comport themselves,
my Uncle Robert. I give you my word as one&mdash;&rdquo; Then as I
hesitated in terror at the revelation of my woman&rsquo;s estate I
had been about to make, my Uncle, the General Robert, made this
remark to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women are like crows, all black; and the exceptional
white one only makes the rest look blacker. The only way to stop
them in their depredations is to trap them, since the law forbids
shooting them.&rdquo; And as he made this judgment of women I
forgot for a moment that we discussed that Madam Whitworth, whom it
was causing me great pain to discover to be the enemy of France,
and I thought of my beautiful mother, whom he had judged without
ever having encountered, and a great longing rose in my heart so to
comport myself that his heart should learn to trust in me as a man
and then discover the honor of woman through me at some future
time. I took a resolve that such should be the case and to that end
I asked of him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that I can serve you in these serious troubles,
my Uncle Robert?&rdquo; And as I asked that question I made also a
vow in my heart against that black crow woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m coming to. The French
Government is sending an army expert down here to look over the
situation and make the contracts. I can&rsquo;t speak their
heathenish tongue or read it, and I want somebody whom I can
trust&mdash;trust, mind you&mdash;to help me talk with him and make
any necessary translations. That Whitworth hussy has been
translating for us and I don&rsquo;t trust her. Your letter was
handed to me in the Governor&rsquo;s private office and both he and
I saw what a help it would be to have you here when this
Frenchie&mdash;who is a Count Something or Other&mdash;and his
servants and secretaries, what he calls his suite, arrive. By
George, sir, we need your advice in eating and drinking them! Do
you suppose they&rsquo;ll have intelligence enough to eat the manna
of the gods, which is corn pone, and drink the nectar, which is
plain whiskey, or will we be expected to furnish them with snails
and absinthe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that I laughed a very large laugh and made this answer to the
perturbation of my Uncle, the General Robert:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you after luncheon, my Uncle Robert, because
I have not as yet eaten in this Harpeth country of
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll talk about it after you&rsquo;ve
had one of old Kizzie&rsquo;s fried chicken dinners. Here we are at
the Mansion. Remember, you know the <em>whole</em> situation and
are only supposed to know the part that Governor Bill
<em>thinks</em> is the whole. Look at me, boy!&rdquo; And as the
big car drove up to the curb before a great stone house with tall
pillars on guard of its front, he laid both his hands upon my
shoulders and turned me towards him with force and no gentleness
and then with his keen eyes did he look down into the very soul of
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see I can trust you, sir. God bless you,
boy!&rdquo; he said after a very long moment of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Uncle Robert,&rdquo; I answered him without
turning my eyes from his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, here we are. I came to the side door so I
wouldn&rsquo;t have to introduce you to any of the boys this
morning, for we want to have a talk with the Governor before dinner
and I don&rsquo;t dare keep Kizzie waiting. It riles her, and a
riled woman burns up things: masters, husbands, cooking or worse.
Come on.&rdquo; And as we walked up the broad side steps of that
Mansion of the Gouverneur, my Uncle Robert&rsquo;s hand was on my
arm and I felt that I was being marched up to the mouth of the gun
of Fate and I wished very much I could have been habited in my
corduroy or cheviot skirts, no matter how short or narrow they
might be. A number of gentlemen sat upon the wide verandah smoking
pipes or long cigars under the budding rose vine that trailed from
one tall pillar to another, and more stood and talked in groups
beside the large front door that opened into the wide hall. At the
back of the hall before a closed door stood a very large black man
who was very old and bent and who had tufts of white wool of the
aspect of a sheep upon his head. He was attired in a long gray coat
of a military cut that I afterwards learned was of the late
Confederacy, and I soon had much affection for him because of his
reminiscences of that war and also because of his affection for my
noble father, to whom he had told the same stories&rsquo; in his
early youth.</p>
<p>My Uncle, the General Robert, had not paused to present to me
any of the gentlemen with whom he had exchanged jovial greetings,
but he stopped beside the old black man and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Henry&rsquo;s boy, Robert, Cato. Fine young chap,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, Mas&rsquo; Robert,&rdquo; answered Cato as he
peered into my face with the nicest affection in his black eyes set
in large spaces of white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Henry, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Fore God, yes, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look after him, Cato. He&rsquo;ll be about
considerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat I will&mdash;Mas&rsquo; Henry&rsquo;s boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No lobbying dimity chasing him, Cato!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I understands, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the Governor ready for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, you&rsquo;s to go right in, Mas&rsquo; Robert.
Mr. Clendenning is with him jest now, but he&rsquo;ll be out in a
turkey&rsquo;s call of time. Jest walk in, sir, and you, the young
marster,&rdquo; and with a bow that almost allowed that the tails
of the long gray coat swept the floor, the old black man opened the
door and motioned us into the room of the Gouverneur of the State
of Harpeth.</p>
<p>It has been given to me in the very short time of my life to be
often in the home of the President of France, to be presented at
the court of England with my father, to the Czar at Petrograd and
to the old Franz Joseph, as well as to the beloved Albert and
Elizabeth in Brussels, where I did go often to play with the young
princess, and I do know very well how to manage skirts whether very
tight, or very wide with ruffles, in the case of such
presentations, but my heart rose very high up and beat so near to
the roots of my tongue that it was impossible for me to speak as I
was presented, in the traveling tweeds of a young man of American
fashion, to the very wonderful and beautiful and fearful Gouverneur
Williamson Faulkner of the State of Harpeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my boy, Governor,&rdquo; was all the
introduction my Uncle, the General Robert, administered to me, and
I stood and looked into the face of him whom afterwards I
discovered to be the greatest gentleman in the world, with my heart
beating in my throat and yet astir under my woman&rsquo;s breast in
the place it had always before resided.</p>
<h2><a id="ChVI" name="ChVI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>
<h3>&ldquo;WE BOTH NEED YOU&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I do not know how it is that I shall find words in which to
write down the loveliness of that Gouverneur of Old Harpeth. He was
not as tall as my Uncle, the General Robert, and he was slender and
lithe as some wild thing in a forest, but the power in the
broadness of his shoulders and in the strength of his nervous hands
was of a greatness of which to be frightened; that is, I think, of
which a man should be frightened but in which a woman would take
much glory. His hair was of the tarnished gold of a sunset storm
and upon his temples was a curved crest of white that sparkled like
the spray of a wave. All of which I must have seen with some kind
of inward eyes, for from the moment my eyes lifted themselves from
contemplating the carpet in embarrassment over my tweed trousers
they were looking into his in a way which at dawn my eyes have
gazed into the morning star rising near to me over the little wood
at the Chateau de Grez. I did not for many days know whether those
eyes were gray or blue or purple, for when I regarded them I forgot
to decide, and also they were so deep and shadowed by the blackness
of their lashes and brows that such a decision was difficult. At
this time I only knew that in them lay the fire of the lightning
over Old Harpeth when the storm breaks, the laugh of the very small
boy who splashes bare feet in the water with glee, and also a
coldness of the stars upon the frost of winter. I was glad that I
came across the dark ocean to flee from the cruel guns into a
strange land to look into those eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good that you have come, Robert Carruthers, for the
General and I both need you,&rdquo; were the words I heard him
saying to me in a voice that was as deep and of as much interest as
the eyes, and as he spoke those words he took one of my hands in
both of his strong ones. &ldquo;And if you say snails, snails it
shall be, if Cato and I have to invade every rose garden in
Hayesville and vicinity and stay up all night to catch
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall choose that corn pone and whiskey that my
Uncle, the General Robert, has promised to me from one bad tempered
cook at the time of my luncheon,&rdquo; I found myself saying with
a laugh that answered the bare-footed boy who suddenly looked at me
out of the cool eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I would let him have a try-out with Kizzie
before we decided what to feed the savages,&rdquo; also said my
Uncle, the General Robert, with a laugh. &ldquo;Besides, he&rsquo;s
one himself and I&rsquo;ll have to go slow and tame him
gradually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s ours. He&rsquo;s just come back to his own
from a strange land, General, and you&rsquo;ll kill the fatted calf
or rooster, whichever Kizzie decides, with joy at getting
him.&rdquo; And this time the star eyes gave to me the quick
sympathy for which I had prayed before the Virgin with the Infant
in her arms in the little chapel of the old convent just before we
had to flee from the shells, leaving my father to the Sisters to
bury after the enemy had come. I think my eyes did tell that tale
to his and the tears ached in my throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, boy,&rdquo; he said softly and then turned and
presented me to the Mr. Clendenning who was arranging papers at a
desk beside the window.</p>
<p>I do like with my whole heart that funny Buzz Clendenning, who
has the reddest hair, the largest brown speckles on his face and
the widest mouth that I have ever beheld. Also, his laugh is even
wider than is his mouth and overflows the remainder of his face in
ripples of what is called grin. He is not much taller than am I,
but of much more powerful build, as is natural, though he did not
at that moment recognize the reason thereof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake hands, boys; don&rsquo;t stand looking at each
other like young puppies,&rdquo; said my Uncle, the General Robert,
as he clapped his hand on the back of the Mr. Buzz Clendenning.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to fight it out. Your fathers licked
each other week about for twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I even ask him to take off his coat once,
General?&rdquo; answered that Mr. Buzz with the grin all over his
face and spreading to my countenance as he took my hand in his to
administer one of those shakes of which I had had so many since my
arrival in America. For a second he looked startled and glanced
down at my white hand that he held in his and from it to my eyes
that were looking into his with the entire friendliness of my
heart. Suddenly I had a great fright of discovery within me and my
knees began to again tremble together for their skirts, but before
that fright had reached my eyes quite, I had born to me an elder
brother in the person of that Buzz Clendenning, and I now know that
I can never lose him, even when he knows that&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no shakes in the duel, Prince, so let&rsquo;s
kiss and make up before you get out your sword,&rdquo; he said as
he also, as my Uncle, the General Robert, had done, laid an arm
across my shoulders in an embrace of affection. It was then I made
a discovery in the strange land into which I was penetrating: Men
have much sentiment in their hearts that it is impossible for a
woman to discover from behind a fan. They keep it entirely for each
other as comrades, and I received a large portion of such an
affection when that Mr. Buzz Clendenning adopted me in what he
thought was my foreign weakness, as a small brother to be protected
in his large heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very happy to so salute you instead of the
duel,&rdquo; I made answer and did immediately put a kiss on his
one cheek, expecting that he would return it upon my cheeks, first
one and then another, as is the custom of comrades and officers in
France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, help! Don&rsquo;t do that again or I&rsquo;ll call
out the police,&rdquo; responded that funny Mr. Buzz Clendenning,
as he shook me away from him, while my Uncle, the General Robert,
and the great Gouverneur did both indulge in laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am abashed and I beg your pardon for offending against
the customs of your country. I do remember now that my father did
not permit such a salutation from his brother officers, and I will
not do so again, Monsieur Buzz Clendenning,&rdquo; I said as my
cheeks became crimson with mortification and tears would have come
over my eyes had my pride permitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what he meant you to do, Buzz, you duffer. I said
good-bye to twenty-two of my friends this way the day I set sail
from old Heidelberg,&rdquo; and as he spoke, that great and
beautiful and exalted Gouverneur Faulkner did bend his head to mine
and give to me the correct comrade salute of my own country on
first one of my cheeks and then upon the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, your Excellency,&rdquo; I murmured with
gratitude. I wonder what that Russian Count Estzkerwitch or Mr.
Peter Scudder or Lord Leigholm on those Scotch moors, would have
thought to hear Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, express such
gratitude for two small pecks upon her cheek delivered in
America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it&rsquo;s mighty pretty to look at but I
reckon the kid had better stow the habit before he is introduced to
Jeff Whitworth and Miles Menefee and the rest of the bunch,&rdquo;
said that Mr. Buzz as he left off wiping from his cheek with the
back of his hand the kiss I had put there, and administered to me
another embrace on my shoulders with his long arm. &ldquo;Besides,
youngster, there are <em>girls</em> in Hayesville,&rdquo; he added
with a grin that again was reflected on my face without my will and
which did entirely take away my anger and embarrassment at his
repulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls! Girls!&rdquo; exploded my Uncle, the General
Robert. &ldquo;The female young generally known as girls are about
as much use to humanity as a bunch of pin feathers tied with a pink
ribbon would be in the place of the household feather duster that
the Lord lets them grow into after they reach their years of
discretion. Robert has no time to waste with the unfledged.
Don&rsquo;t even suggest it to him, Clendenning. And now you can
take him around to my house and tell Kizzie to begin filling you
both up while I wait for a moment to go over these papers with the
Governor. And both of you avoid the female young, for we&rsquo;ve
work for you; mind you, work and no gallivanting. Now go!
Depart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old boy is a forty-two centimeter gun that fires at
the mention of the lovely sex and doesn&rsquo;t stop until the
ammunition gives out,&rdquo; said Mr. Buzz Clendenning as he slid
into the seat of his slim gray racer beside me and started from the
curb on high without a single kick of the engine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to wish a nice girl, whom he couldn&rsquo;t shake off, onto
him for about a week and watch him squirm along to surrender. Wait
until you see Sue Tomlinson get hold of him down on the street some
day. He shuts his eyes and just fires away at her while she purrs
at him, and it is a sight for the gods. Sue&rsquo;s father died and
left her with her invalid mother and not enough money to invite in
the auctioneer, but the General took some old accounts of the
Doctor&rsquo;s, collected and invested them and made up plenty of
money for Sue&rsquo;s grubstake, though he goes around three blocks
to get past her. Sue adores him and approaches him from all sides,
but has never made a landing yet. Say, you&rsquo;ll like Sue. She
is pretty enough to eat, but don&rsquo;t try to bite. It&rsquo;s no
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that this lovely Mademoiselle Sue does not like
gentlemen save my Uncle, the General Robert?&rdquo; I asked with
great interest. I was glad in my heart that I was soon to see and
speak with a nice girl even if it had to be in character of a
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she loves us&mdash;all,&rdquo; answered that Mr. Buzz
with the greatest gloom. &ldquo;<em>All</em> of us&mdash;every
blamed son-of-a-gun of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I comprehend now that it is your wish that she love
only you, Mr. Clendenning, and are sad that she does not,&rdquo; I
said as I looked at him with much sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is about it, Prince, but don&rsquo;t say I said so.
Everybody chases Susan. She even wins an occasional ice cream smile
from His Excellency. I bet she&rsquo;d go up against that august
iceberg itself in a try-out for a &lsquo;First Lady of the
State&rsquo; badge if Mrs. Pat Whitworth hadn&rsquo;t got the whole
woman bunch to believe she has a corner on his ice. Mrs. Pat is
some little cornerer, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I did like that Madam Whitworth, and I hope that it
will be my pleasure to see her again soon,&rdquo; I said with an
ice in my voice as I caught my breath while Mr. Buzz Clendenning
drove between two cars and a wagon with not so much as an inch to
spare on all three sides of the car. It is as I like to drive when
at the wheel, but sitting beside another&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see her at the Governor&rsquo;s dinner for
you Tuesday, if not sooner, and just watch her and the General war
dance with each other. He opens his eyes when Mrs. Pat attacks and
he imagines he is the whole Harpeth Valley Militia defending His
Excellency of Iceland from her wiles. Just watch him!&rdquo; And
this time it was three wagons that we slid between and beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it that the great Gouverneur Faulkner has such a
coldness for ladies?&rdquo; I asked of that Mr. Buzz. &ldquo;I did
find him to be of such a beautiful kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been too much chased. He&rsquo;s got his
fingers crossed on them, they tell me. Just watch him in action at
his dinner. He side-steps so gently that they never know
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it then that he gives to me this dinner of honor
when he so dislikes all&mdash;that is, I mean to ask of you why is
it that I am so honored by that very great Gouverneur Faulkner of
the State of Harpeth?&rdquo; I asked, and I had a great fright that
I had again so nearly betrayed Robert Carruthers to be one of the
sex so hated by that noble gentleman, the Gouverneur Faulkner.
&ldquo;I must think of myself as a man in future,&rdquo; I
commanded myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the General tell you about it? It is to
introduce you to the flower and chivalry of your native land.
Believe me, it will be some dinner dance. The General wanted it to
be a stag, but Sue fought to the last trench, which was tears, and
he gave in. These days the Governor loses no chance to honor his
Secretary of State for&mdash;for political reasons,&rdquo; and as
he spoke that good Mr. Clendenning looked at the wheel for
steering, and I could see that there was deep concern in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that&mdash;that trouble of mules, Monsieur
Clendenning?&rdquo; I asked of him softly in a woman&rsquo;s way
for administering sympathy for distress but without the masculine
discretion that I was to learn swiftly thereafter to employ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about it, for I don&rsquo;t know how
much either of us knows or our chief wants us to know, but Governor
Williamson Faulkner is a man of honor and I&rsquo;d stake my life
on that. He&rsquo;s being pushed hard and&mdash;Gee! Here we are at
the General&rsquo;s and I can smell Kizzie&rsquo;s cream gravy with
my mind&rsquo;s nose. I understand that your father was the last
Henry Carruthers of five born up in the old mahogany bedstead that
the General inhabits between the hours of one and five A.M. Some
shack, this of the General&rsquo;s, isn&rsquo;t it? Nothing finer
in the State.&rdquo; And as he spoke that Mr. Buzz Clendenning
stopped the car before the home of my Uncle, the General Robert,
and we alighted from it together.</p>
<p>I do not know how it is that I can put into words the beautiful
feeling that rose from the inwardness of me as I stood in front of
the home of my fathers in this far-away America. The entire city of
Hayesville is a city of old homes, I had noticed as I drove in the
gray car so rapidly along with Mr. Buzz Clendenning while he was
speaking to me, but no house had been so beautiful as was this one.
It was old, with almost the vine-covered age of the Chateau de
Grez, but instead of being of gray stone it was of a red brick that
was as warm as the embers of an oak fire with the film of ashes
crusting upon it. Thus it seemed to be both red and gray beneath
the vines that were casting delicate green traceries over its
walls. Great white pillars were to the front of it like at the
Mansion of the Gouverneur, and many wide windows and doors opened
out from it. Two old oak trees which give to it the name of Twin
Oaks stood at each side of the old brick walk that led from the
tall gate, and as I walked under them I felt that I had from a
cruel world come home.</p>

<h3>THE GIRL BUNCH</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>And, if I felt in that manner as I entered the house, I felt it
to a still greater degree when I was welcomed by that most lovely
old black slave woman of the high temper and good cookery. She
opened the door for us herself, though a nice boy the color of a
chocolate bonbon stood in waiting to perform that office. She had a
spoon in her hand and upon her head was a spotless white turban, as
also was an apron of an equal spotlessness tied around her very
large waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Mas&rsquo; Robert, you done come home from the
heathen land to keep my food waiting jest like yo&rsquo; father did
from the minute I ontied him from my apron string. Come right into
the dining room &rsquo;fore my gravy curdles and the liver wing I
done saved for you gits too brown in the skillet,&rdquo; was all of
the introduction or greeting that she gave to me as she waddled
along behind Mr. Buzz Clendenning and myself, driving us down the
hall and into the dining-room. &ldquo;Mas&rsquo; Buzz, how is
yo&rsquo; mother? I &rsquo;lowed to git over to see her soon as
this ruckus of young Mas&rsquo; coming home is over. Now,
here&rsquo;s the place fer you both and that no &lsquo;count boy
will bring in yo&rsquo; dinner proper to you or he&rsquo;ll be
skunt alive.&rdquo; With which she departed through a door, from
which came an aroma that led to madness of hunger, and left the
bonbon servant to attend us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I hope Kizzie killed by the half dozen last night;
if there aren&rsquo;t three chickens apiece you&rsquo;ll be hungry,
L&rsquo;Aiglon,&rdquo; said Mr. Buzz Clendenning with a laugh as he
seated himself beside me and unfolded his napkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that you might call me Robert, Mr.
Clendenning,&rdquo; I said with a great friendliness as I ate a
food that I had not before tasted and that I did so much like that
I was tempted to steal some to put in my pocket for fear I would
come to believe that I had dreamed it to exist. It is called corn
pone and is made of maize, and it will be found in some form at
every meal upon my Uncle, the General Robert&rsquo;s, table, good
Kizzie assured me as I made her a compliment about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though the name of that son of our great Napoleon is very
dear to me,&rdquo; I added at his quick glance, fearing he might
think me offended at what is called a nickname.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Bobbie, and you&rsquo;ll forget that I
wouldn&rsquo;t let you kiss me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he answered
as he drew back from the table and lit a cigarette after passing me
the case. &ldquo;Everybody calls me Buzz the Bumble Bee because of
a historic encounter of mine with a whole nest of bumblebees right
out here in the General&rsquo;s garden. It is a title of heroism
and I&rsquo;d like to have you use it as if we&rsquo;d been kids
together as we were slated to have been. Gee, I bet you could have
beat the bees down some. You looked all soft to me when I first saw
you but you are so quick and lithe and springy that you must be
some steel. What do you weigh out, stripped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;er, about one-thirty,&rdquo; I answered, and I
made a resolve not to blush or show anything of embarrassment, no
matter what was to be said to me in my estate of a young
gentleman.</p>
<p>And I make this note to myself that it is a great pleasure and
interest to sit beside a nice young man with a cigarette in his
mouth and one in my hand as if for smoking, which I do not like to
do from its bitterness, and converse with him about matters of good
sense without having in any way to use that coquetry which breaks
into small sections the usual conversation between a man and a
woman of enthusiastic youngness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tip at one fifty-two, but I&rsquo;m an inch and a half
taller. Do you run? You&rsquo;re good and deep chested,&rdquo; he
further inquired and it was with difficulty that I again controlled
the blush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fence and I&rsquo;m large of lung,&rdquo; I answered
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything ever foaled,&rdquo; I answered in words I had
heard my father use about my horsemanship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some&mdash;wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I play a hurry game myself,&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;Dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a greatness of pleasure,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>After that for a time he puffed at his cigarette and I looked
around the long dining room that was almost as large as the
dining-hall at the Chateau de Grez and which was dark and rich and
full of old silver on the sideboard and old portraits on the walls.
Finally my Buzz put out the stub of his cigarette in his saucer and
looked me keenly in the face as I raised my eyes to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Booze?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, old top. Me neither! Say, let&rsquo;s
go call on Sue and you can get a nice little initiation into the
girl bunch before the General stops you by locking you away from
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that I might, but I must unpack my bags and write
the letters to small Pierre and my nurse Nannette; also be ready
for translations for my Uncle, the General Robert, when he arrives.
Will you persuade the lovely Mademoiselle Sue that she save one
little dance for me on that evening of Tuesday?&rdquo; I said as we
rose and walked down the long hall towards the wide door under the
budding rose vine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll dead sure give you one&mdash;of mine,&rdquo;
he answered me with a laugh, &ldquo;but come along with me now,
L&rsquo;Aiglon. The General won&rsquo;t be home until night. I laid
some letters on his desk that will hold him and Governor Bill until
sunset. They&rsquo;ll have pie and milk sent in and work it all out
together. What&rsquo;s the use of having them to watch the affairs
of the State of Harpeth for us if we don&rsquo;t use the time they
are on watch in having some joy life? Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go,&rdquo; I made answer with a great pleasure.</p>
<p>Then we descended to the gray car of much speed and did use that
speed in turning many streets until we came to another very fine
old house, where, I was informed by my Mr. Buzz Clendenning,
resides that Mademoiselle Susan of so much loveliness.</p>
<p>And it is of a truth that I discovered that loveliness to be as
great as was told to me by her true lover. When I raised my head
from the kiss of presentation I gave to her hand I looked into very
deep and very wonderful girl eyes that had in their depths tears
that were for a sympathy for me, I knew. My heart of an exile beat
very high in my own girl&rsquo;s breast that ached for the refuge
of her woman&rsquo;s arms, and I must have partly betrayed my
yearning to her, for I saw an expression of confused question come
into her eyes that looked into mine; then the beautiful thing that
had come into my Mr. Buzz Clendenning&rsquo;s eyes for me came also
into hers in place of the question. I saw then in those eyes a
sister born to the boy Robert Carruthers of a great French
strangeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you all morning, Mr.
Carruthers, and hoping Buzz would bring you with him to see me
first of all. I wanted to be the first one of the girls to say,
&lsquo;Welcome home&rsquo; to you.&rdquo; And as she spoke those
words of much tenderness I again bent over her hand in salutation
because I could give forth no words from my throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sue, you are the real sweet thing&mdash;and now notice me
a bit, will you?&rdquo; said my fine Mr. Buzz Clendenning with both
emotion and a teasing in his voice. &ldquo;I know I haven&rsquo;t
got French manners and don&rsquo;t look like L&rsquo;Aiglon, but
I&rsquo;m an affectionate rough jewel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t mind Buzz, Mr. Carruthers&mdash;he
just can&rsquo;t help buzzing. Isn&rsquo;t it great about the dance
Tuesday night? I fought hard to save you from a horrid long banquet
with a lot of solemn men. I ought to be the belle of that ball and
you and Buzz will be ungrateful if you neglect me,&rdquo; and as
she made these remarks for laughter, I liked still more this new
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the good, thoughtful little missionary to the
foreigner, Susan. I suppose you wanted to stay at home and tat
socks while Bobbie and I dined and wined&mdash;not,&rdquo; was the
very unappreciative answer that was made to her by that Buzz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For always I will be your humble slave, Mademoiselle
Susan,&rdquo; was the answer I made into her laughing eyes.
&ldquo;All the evening I will wait in loneliness for the small
crumbs of dance that you throw to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Robert; you don&rsquo;t know how spoiled
Susan is and you&rsquo;re making trouble for me. Besides, you
haven&rsquo;t seen the baby Belle in war paint yet. Let&rsquo;s go
call on her now!&rdquo; And that Mr. Buzz Clendenning was in a
moment ready for making more new friends for me. &ldquo;Come on,
Susan, we can tie Prince Bob on the running board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s Belle at the gate now
and&mdash;yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s Mrs. Whitworth with her. I wonder
when she came from New York,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Susan as we
went to meet the guests approaching, I on the one side of her and
the Mr. Buzz on the other.</p>
<h2><a id="ChVIII" name="ChVIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>
<h3>IN THE DRESS OF MAGNIFICENCE</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The beautiful Madam Whitworth came down upon the same
train which I occupied,&rdquo; I said as I remembered to raise from
my head my hat by that action on the part of my Mr. Buzz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you have been presented to
L&rsquo;Aiglon?&rdquo; said Mr. Buzz to that Madam Whitworth who
stood smiling while I was presented to the very lovely girl of
great blondness, who both blushed and what is called giggled as I
kissed her hand, though in her eyes I found a nice friendliness to
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are old friends who know all about each other,
aren&rsquo;t we, Mr. Robert Carruthers?&rdquo; and in her gay
answer to that Mr. Buzz I detected a challenge as her eyes of blue
flowers in snow looked into mine with the keenness of a knife, to
detect if I had yet been told aught of her by my Uncle. And in the
answering look of friendliness I gave her was concealed also a
knife of great keenness, which came from a brain with which I hoped
to do to the death that enemy of France. And also I felt my heart
spring to the protection of the honor of great Gouverneur Faulkner,
who had given me a comrade&rsquo;s salute within a few hours past;
and also to the protection of the honor of my house in the person
of my Uncle, the General Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I have much joy that I was given the opportunity
to know the very beautiful Madam Whitworth at so early a time in my
life in America,&rdquo; I made answer to her question in words as I
bent also over her hand for a kiss of salutation.</p>
<p>And then I had a great amusement at the skill with which that
Madam Whitworth brought it to pass that I walked with her from that
gate and left the three new and lovely friends I had made looking
after me with affection and regret at my departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it was horrid of me to snatch you like that
from those infants, but&mdash;I really had the claim to have you
for a little time to hear your impressions of Hayesville, now,
didn&rsquo;t I?&mdash;you boy with eyes as beautiful as a
girl&rsquo;s!&rdquo; she said to me as I walked down the wide
street beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will always make such claims of me,
Madam,&rdquo; I made answer with the great sweetness with which I
was determined for the time to keep covered the steel knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how to claim&mdash;and also to reward,&rdquo; she
answered me with a warmth that gave me a great discomfort.
&ldquo;And how did you escape from the General into feminine
society on your very first day? Wasn&rsquo;t there work for you at
the Capitol? I understand that they are expecting that French
Commissioner very soon now.&rdquo; She asked the question with an
indifference that I knew to be false.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is that I am allowed to get my&mdash;what you
say in English?&mdash;land legs,&rdquo; I answered with much
unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of that Frenchman who is coming down for the
mule contracts, of which by this time you have doubtless heard, I
wonder why it is that the Count of Lasselles, your friend, is
sending one of his lieutenants instead of coming himself. Did he
say anything of coming down later? I wish he would, for to my mind
he is one of your greatest soldiers and I would like to look into
his face. That portrait in the <em>Review</em> is one of the most
interesting I have almost ever seen. Is there any chance of his
coming down?&rdquo; And I was of a great curiosity at the anxiety
in her face about the movements of my Capitaine, the Count de
Lasselles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me only that he would go to the grain fields of
English Canada, Madam,&rdquo; I answered her by guardedly telling
her no more than my words upon that train had revealed to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he writes to you, you must tell me about it,&rdquo;
she said with great friendliness. &ldquo;I am interested in
everything that happens to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do that, with thanks for your interest,&rdquo; I
answered to her with an air of great devotion. &ldquo;And behold,
is it not the Twin Oaks of my Uncle I see across the street?&rdquo;
I asked as I stopped in front of that fine old home that was now
mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on down the street to my home and I&rsquo;ll give
you a cup of tea,&rdquo; she invited me with very evident desire
for my company for more questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give many thanks, but that is not possible to me, as I
must write notes to my Pierre and old Nannette for the evening
railroad. I bid you good day, beautiful Madam,&rdquo; and again I
bent over her hand in a salutation of departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll see you again soon,&rdquo; she said and
smiled at me as I stood with my hat in my hand as she went away
from me down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Vive la France</em> and Harpeth America!&rdquo; I
said to myself as I ascended the steps, was admitted by the Bonbon
and conducted up the stairway to my apartments by good Kizzie, whom
I met in the wide hall.</p>
<p>And there ensued an hour of the greatest interest to me as the
very good old slave woman led me from one of the rooms in the large
house to another, with many stories of great interest. At last we
came to that room in which had been deposited my bags and my other
equipment for my journey and there we made a very long pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your Grandma Carruthers&rsquo; room, the
General&rsquo;s grandma, and she was the high-headedest lady of the
whole family. That am her portrait over the mantelshelf. You is
jest like her as two peas in the pod and I reckin I&rsquo;ll have
to take a stick to you like I did to yo&rsquo; father when he was
most growed up and stole all the fruitcake I had done baked in July
fer Christmas,&rdquo; she said with a wide smile of great affection
upon her very large mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg that you put under a key that cake, beloved Madam
Kizzie,&rdquo; I made answer to her with also a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never was no key to nothing in this house, chile,&rdquo;
she answered to me. &ldquo;I &rsquo;lowed to the Gener&rsquo;l that
he had oughter git a lock and key fer this here flowered silk dress
in the glass case on the wall dat de ole Mis&rsquo; wore at the
ball where she met up with Mas&rsquo; Carruthers, but they do say
that she comes back and walks as a ha&rsquo;nt all dressed in it
and these here slippers and stockings and folderols in the carved
box on the table here under her picture. Is you &lsquo;fraid of
ha&rsquo;nts, honey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be afraid of this beautiful Grandmamma in this
dress of so great magnificence, my good Kizzie,&rdquo; I made
answer to her with more of courage than I at that moment felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s only in case of a death in the house
that she&mdash;Lands alive, am that my cake burning?&rdquo; With
which exclamation the good Kizzie left me to the company of the
beautiful Grandmamma.</p>
<p>After having unpacked and nicely put away all of the apparel
from my two large bags, the fine Bonbon retired below to answer a
summons from good Kizzie, and left me alone for the first time
since I had opened my eyes that morning while being whirled in the
railway train down into the State of Harpeth. I looked at the
hunting watch strapped to my wrist, which I had worn while
traveling, and saw that it was after five o&rsquo;clock, and I felt
that I must sleep before dining, if for only a moment.</p>
<p>Thereupon I immediately climbed slowly and awkwardly out of that
gray tweed suit of clothes. I did so wonder what could be the best
method of releasing one&rsquo;s self from trousers. It is a feat of
balance to stand on one foot and remove one portion of the two
sides of the trousers, and yet it is an entanglement to drop the
two portions upon the floor and attempt to step out of them with
the shoes upon your feet. Having succeeded in getting out of them
the last night when prone upon the sleeping shelf of the railroad
train, without injury to them, I again prostrated myself upon the
huge bed in my room and disentangled myself from them while in that
position.</p>
<p>After having completely disrobed I took the bath of the
temperature of milk that Nannette is accustomed to administer to
me, inserted myself in the very lovely &lsquo;wedding&rsquo;
garments for sleeping that Mr. G. Slade had so admired, and sank
into deep slumber upon the large bed with a silk covering
beflowered like the skirt of a lady&rsquo;s dress upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, you young sleepyhead, up and into your
clothes, sir. We are late for the Capitol now,&rdquo; were the
words I heard in what seemed almost the first moment after I had
closed my eyes. Behold, my Uncle, the General Robert, fully
dressed, stood beside the bed and a morning sun was shining through
the windows. I had slept through a long night like a small child
upon the bosom of the bed of my beautiful Grandmamma who smiled
down upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my Uncle Robert, how much time is it that I have to
make my toilet?&rdquo; I begged of him as I sat up and made a
rubbing of my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less than an hour, sir, to get out of that heathenish
toggery that the men of your generation have substituted for the
honest nightshirt, into proper garments, and eat your breakfast.
I&rsquo;ll call you when I am ready to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very little more than the hour my Uncle, the General
Robert, had given to me, that I consumed in the accomplishment of a
very difficult toilet in a suit of very beautiful brown cheviot
which the good man in New York from whom I had procured it had said
to be for very especial morning wear. To my good Kizzie I gave a
great uneasiness that I did not consume the very elaborate meal
that resembled a dinner, which she had ready for the Bonbon to
serve to me, and desired only a cup of her coffee and two very
small pieces of white bread called biscuits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the Carruthers men folks is friends with their food,
they is,&rdquo; she admonished me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At luncheon, my Kizzie, just watch me,&rdquo; I said to
her in nice United States words as I departed with my Uncle, the
General Robert, to the Capitol of the State of Harpeth, which is a
tall building set on an equally tall hill.</p>
<p>I found much business awaiting me in the form of making a
correct translation of all of the letters in a very large
portfolio, all of which were pertaining to that very tiresome
animal, the mule. But I made not very much progress, for a very
large number of gentlemen came into the office of my Uncle, the
General Robert, and to all of them I must be presented.</p>
<p>In fact, in all of what remained of that entire week, for most
of my moments in the Capitol I was having very painful shakes of
the hand given to me and receiving assurances of my great
resemblance to my honored father.</p>
<p>All of which I did greatly enjoy, but nothing was of so much
pleasure to me as the visits I accomplished into the office of that
Gouverneur Faulkner with messages of importance from my Uncle, the
General Robert.</p>
<p>It was with a very fine and cold smile of friendliness that he
at first received me, as I stood with humble attention before his
desk upon my first mission to him, but with each message I
perceived that the stars in his eyes, so hid beneath his brows,
shone upon me with a greater interest.</p>
<p>And in observing the many heavy burdens that pressed upon his
strong shoulders until at the close of each day a whiteness was
over his very beautiful face, I grew to desire that I could make
some little things for him easier. I sought to so do and I
discovered that it was possible to beguile many very heavy persons
to tell to me what it was they wished to impose upon him.</p>
<p>I took upon a long ride in the car of my Uncle, the General
Robert, that Road Commissioner, who was making a trouble for my
Gouverneur Faulkner about taking much money from the sum that he
desired to be voted for use on the roads of the State of Harpeth,
thus making my Gouverneur Faulkner not beloved of the people in the
country around the capital city, and when I returned him I had used
many beguilements in the way of flattery about the superiority of
the roads of America to the roads of all of the world, and had also
jolted him to such an extent that he did write a nice letter to my
Gouverneur Faulkner asking that that money be not voted less but
even more, so as to &ldquo;beat out the world with the roads of
Harpeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; was the reward that I got from my
Gouverneur Faulkner for that feat, and a smile that was of such a
loveliness that it lasted me all of the day.</p>
<p>Also I made a hard work for myself in saving that Gouverneur
Faulkner by much flattery from a large lady who was anxious that he
sign a paper by which all women might vote that no more whiskey for
mint julep should exist. I very willingly put the name of Mr.
Robert Carruthers to the paper, for I do not like those juleps, and
I persuaded the nice large lady that she go in that car of my
Uncle, the General Robert, with me away from the proximity to my
chief, the Gouverneur Faulkner, to a place in the city where we
could drink that ice cream soda water that I do so love.</p>
<p>That lady was very like many other persons who came to see my
Gouverneur and whom I persuaded to make me much exhaustion instead
of him. It was while telling him of the lady and the two very
delicious soda ice creams that he very suddenly interrupted me with
a nice smile that had in it a small warmth like the first glow of a
fire, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert, I&rsquo;m going to ask the General to lend you to
me for a couple of weeks while I am so pressed. Buzz can do more
for him than you do and&mdash;and, well, just looking at you and
hearing you tell about the flies you brush from my wearied brow,
rests me. Report to me to-morrow instead of to him. I know it will
be all right, for he really needs Buzz. Now you run home and get
ready for one great time at this party I&rsquo;m giving to you
to-night. And, Robert, remember to tell me everything the flies
say, translated in your United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will and I go, my Gouverneur Faulkner,&rdquo; I made an
answer to him with a laugh in which I did not show entirely all of
the pleasure I experienced when I discovered I was to be in the
place of his secretary, that fine Buzz Clendenning.</p>
<p>And with much haste I took my departure from the Capitol of the
State of Harpeth to Twin Oaks in the car of my Uncle, the General
Robert, for I knew that upon this evening I must make a new and
terrible toilet and I would require much time thereto.</p>
<p>The good old Nannette and my Governess Madam Fournet have always
taught me that the art of a lovely woman&rsquo;s toilet could not
be performed in less than two hours, and I felt that I had better
begin in the way to which I was accustomed and go as far as I could
in that direction, then finish in the manly manner which would now
be of a necessity to me.</p>
<p>The good Bonbon, whom I now know is called Sam, had laid out my
evening apparel, from the queer dancing shoes with flat heels to a
very stiff and high collar, upon a couch in the huge room, and
after my bath I began to put them upon me with as much rapidity as
was possible to me. For a few moments all went well, even up to
having tucked the fine and very stiff white linen shirt garment
into the silky black cloth trousers, but a trouble arose when I put
upon myself the beautiful long coat that is in the shape of a
raven, which the American gentleman wears for evening toilet. My
shoulders were sufficiently broad to hold it nicely in place and it
fell with a gracefulness upon my hips, but at my waist it collapsed
on account of a slimness in that locality. The fit of the tweed,
which had been like to that of a bag, had been very correct and had
not revealed the curve of waist, but now it was manifest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that you must do, Roberta, to disguise your
roundness of a young woman? All is lost!&rdquo; I said to myself in
despair. Then a thought came to me. I had never been habited in a
corset in my life on account of a prejudice entertained to that
garment by my Nannette, but I bethought me to remove that shirt and
also the silk one underneath and swath about me one of the heavy
towels of the bath. Immediately I did so and fastened it in place
with a needle and thread from the gentleman&rsquo;s traveling case
that I found in the pocket of my bag. Over it I then drew the silk
undershirt and then that of fine linen, before again putting myself
into the black raven&rsquo;s dress. Behold, all roundness and
slimness had disappeared and when the collar was added I could see
that I was as beautifully habited as either Mr. Peter Scudder or
that Mr. Saint Louis of the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roberta of Grez and Bye,&rdquo; I said to myself as I
looked into the tall mirror, &ldquo;it is indeed a sorrow to you
that you cannot make your courtesy to that Gouverneur Faulkner
habited in the white lace and tulle garment that is in those trunks
which you have lost in that New York, with your throat that your
Russian Cossack has said was like a lily at the blush of dawn, bare
to his eyes, but you are a nice, clean, upstanding American boy who
can be his friend. You must be and you must play the
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the language of that Mr. Willie Saint Louis, it was
&ldquo;some game.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>&ldquo;O&rsquo;ER THE LAND OF THE FREE&mdash;&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>I have a desire to know if it is into the life of every person
there comes one night which he is never to forget until death and
perhaps even after. I do not know; but I am sure that I shall
always keep the memory of the night upon which Mr. Robert
Carruthers of Grez and Bye was introduced to the friends of his
ancestors. It is my jewel that seems a drop of heart&rsquo;s blood
that I will wear forever hid in my breast.</p>
<p>At dinner I sat beside the Gouverneur Williamson Faulkner and
tears came into my eyes as he rose from beside me at the head of
the table and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to drink to the
homecoming of Robert Carruthers, my friend, your friend, and
everybody his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And from that long table there came to me such beautiful and
loving smiles over the glasses of champagne that they went to my
head instead of the wine I could not even sip because of the tears
in my throat. It was as that day upon the great ship when I saw
fulfilled before my eyes my vow to my Capitaine, the Count de
Lasselles: &ldquo;Friends for France.&rdquo; I sat still for a long
minute; then I rose to my feet with my glass in my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot make to you a speech, but I beg that I may say
to you words that were of the first taught to my infant tongue and
which I last repeated in an old convent close to the trenches in
France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in the rich voice which has come to me from the deep
singing of my mother I repeated very quietly:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;say, can you see, by the dawn&rsquo;s early
light,</p>
<p>What so proudly we hailed at the twilight&rsquo;s last
gleaming;</p>
<p>Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro&rsquo; the perilous
fight,</p>
<p>O&rsquo;er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly
streaming?</p>
<p>And the rocket&rsquo;s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,</p>
<p>Gave proof thro&rsquo; the night that our flag was still
there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>through to the last words which had fallen from my lips as I had
taken my father&rsquo;s dying kiss:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;er the land of the free and the home of the
brave.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Though I had not told them of it, I do believe there was not a
heart among those kind people which did not know of that last
moment in the old convent and I could see it in tears dashed aside
as they all rose and sang the last strain of the American song,
with the musicians in the anteroom leading them.</p>
<p>And as they sang that most wonderful song, Gouverneur Faulkner
laid his arm across my shoulder, and the comfort of its strength
gave to me the courage to send back all the smiles that were sent
to me, as that funny Mr. Buzz Clendenning said while they seated
themselves:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, but L&rsquo;Aiglon is the real un-hyphenated brand
of old Uncle Sam, Jr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God that firebrand isn&rsquo;t a girl,&rdquo; I
heard my Uncle, the General Robert, say to most lovely Mademoiselle
Susan, in a corn-colored gown of fine line, who sat at his
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so grateful to you, General, that he is a
boy,&rdquo; I heard her say in the deepest respect and regard for
my Uncle, the General Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt at all, Madam, that you will succeed
in making me wish that he had been born a girl or not at
all,&rdquo; was the kind reply that he made to her nicely spoken
gratitude as we laughed into each other&rsquo;s eyes across the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; was the answer with which Mademoiselle
Sue comforted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now what have you to say to me, boy, the oldest
friend you&rsquo;ve got in America, who hasn&rsquo;t seen you for
days&mdash;that have been too long,&rdquo; said that Madam
Whitworth, who was seated at my side, and as she spoke she turned
one lovely bare shoulder in the direction of my Uncle, the General
Robert, and the beautiful Mademoiselle Sue and also Buzz, as if to
shut them away from her and me in a little space of world just for
two people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can say with truth, Madam, that your loveliness
to-night is but the flowering of my suspicions of it that morning
upon the railroad train,&rdquo; I answered her in words that were a
very nice translation of what that fine young Cossack had once said
to me at the Chateau de Grez of my own flowering into rose chiffon
after an afternoon&rsquo;s hunting with him in corduroys. And in
truth I spoke no falsehood to that Madam Whitworth, for she was of
a very great beauty of body, very much of which was in view from a
scantiness of bodice that I had never seen excelled in any ballroom
in France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you for a poet from that adorable black mop which
I see you have very nicely plastered in an exact imitation of Buzz
Clendenning&rsquo;s red one,&rdquo; she answered me with a laugh.
&ldquo;Follow me from the ballroom just after supper at midnight
for a half hour&rsquo;s chat alone in a place I know; and
don&rsquo;t let either the General or the Governor see you,&rdquo;
she then said in an undertone as the Gouverneur Faulkner bent
forward and began a laughing conversation with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; I answered her under my breath, and I
leaned back in my chair so that the Gouverneur Faulkner could more
conveniently converse with her. And to that end he placed his arm
across the back of my chair, and thus I sat in his embrace with my
shoulder pressed into his.</p>
<p>I do not know exactly what it was that happened in the depths of
me, but suddenly the daredevil rose from those depths and knew
herself for a very strong woman filled to the brim with a
primitive, savage cunning with which to fight the beautiful woman
at my side for the honor of the man whose strong heart I could feel
beating against my woman&rsquo;s breast strapped down under its
garment of man&rsquo;s attire. And that cunning showed me that I
would have a hundredfold better opportunity to do her and her
schemes against him and against France to the death in my garments
and character of a man, than I could have had if I had come into
his and her world as the beautiful young Roberta, Marquise of Grez
and Bye. Then for those hated garments of a raven my heart beat so
high with gratitude that I moved again forward from the arm of His
Excellency for fear that he might feel the tumult even through that
strong towel of the bath which I had sewed above it, and be in
wonderment as to its cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to your first duel with a woman in which you
use a man&rsquo;s weapons, Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, and
see that you score&mdash;for him&mdash;and for France!&rdquo; I
said to myself as we rose from the table and with the other men I
bowed the ladies from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At midnight,&rdquo; I whispered while I bent for a second
to kiss the hand of the beautiful Madam Whitworth as she left the
room. As I raised my head from the salutation I encountered the
eyes of the Gouverneur Faulkner, which looked into mine with an
expression of calm question. And for a moment I let the woman rise
superior to the raven attire and I looked back into those eyes, in
which I saw the mystery of the dawn star, as would have gazed
Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, had she been attired in the
white tulle and lace abandoned in that New York; then I beat her
back down into my heart and gave him the smile of fealty that was
his due from Robert Carruthers, his friend, along with one similar,
to the fine young Buzz Clendenning, who at that moment came to my
side and claimed my attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You score with Sue. I&rsquo;m to be the gracious little
home city host and give up any dances your Marquisity may choose
with her. Sue foxes like she was born in a fox hole under a hollow
log, but she tangoes like the original Emperor Tang himself, so go
ahead and suit yourself. Don&rsquo;t mind me. I&rsquo;m the loving
little playmate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Mademoiselle Sue is so much of a peach that I am
inclined to request the receptacle of cream that I may devour
her,&rdquo; I then made answer to him in as many of the words of
enthusiasm over a nice lady as I could remember that Mr. George
Slade of Detroit to have used over the &ldquo;skirt&rdquo; in
Louisville in the Country of Kentucky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, Bobby! I&rsquo;ll have to go tell Sue that before
she is two minutes older. I wouldn&rsquo;t want her to live five
minutes longer without having heard it. Sue&rsquo;s dead sure to
tell the rest of the girl bunch, so I hope you have a supply where
that came from, for they&rsquo;ll all cry for &rsquo;em.
There&rsquo;s the Governor making towards the door and Mrs. Pat,
who is always waiting at the gate for him, so come, let me lead you
to the dance.&rdquo; With which my nice Buzz and I followed the
Gouverneur Faulkner and the other gentlemen across the hall into
the long salon of the Mansion, whose floors were polished like unto
a lake of ice, for dancing.</p>
<p>In Touraine it is said that a nice lady fairy comes for a visit
of inspection at the <em>berceau</em>&mdash;in America it is
cradle&mdash;of each small human that is born, and gives to it a
beautiful gift if propitiations are made for it to please her. To
that end sweetmeats and nice presents are placed beside the small
infant with which to beguile the good opinion of that fairy. I
would I could be that exalted person and able to visit every small
infant born a female in all of the world. And the gift I would give
to her, there in her sleep, would be to one time in her life attend
a ball in the raven attire of a man in the city of Hayesville of
America. I could bestow no greater gift.</p>
<p>The hours that followed my entry into the ballroom in the
Mansion of the exalted Gouverneur Faulkner were like minutes of
time that dropped from a golden clock of joy. I danced on feet that
were strong wings to glide over a floor that was a many colored
cloud from the reflection of the soft lights and the silken skirts
which ruffled over it. And, what was most enjoyable to me in this
case, I glided in whatever direction pleased me and took with me
the armful of cloud, which was the girl with whom I was dancing, on
long swoops of my own will, instead of being led in my flights by
another as had always before been the case with my dancing. It was
the most of a joy that I had ever experienced. And as I so enjoyed
that freedom I did not know how it was that I should have such a
feeling of dissatisfaction when I beheld that beautiful Madam
Whitworth dancing within the arms of the Gouverneur Williamson
Faulkner. I blushed that I should be so unworthy, with such an
unreasonable fury in my heart, and I looked away so that I seemed
not to see the smile that he sent to me over the head of the very
sweet Belle girl in blue ruffles and silver slippers I was guiding
past him in the trot of a fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sue Tomlinson <em>is</em> as lovely as a ripe peach,
isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; asked Mademoiselle Blue Cloud of me as I
lowered her almost to the floor over my arm, slid her four steps to
the left then trotted her two back and two forward; and her tone
had a very sweet demand of wistfulness in it as she looked up into
my eyes and pressed very close to that protecting towel of the
bath.</p>
<p>For an instant I could not think of one single bonbon of
compliment to offer the lady and I wished I had sat up all of the
night to talk to that Mr. G. Slade of Detroit in the railroad train
and had had my nice gray lady friend in the Ritz-Carlton there with
her notebook to transcribe the many pleasing things he reported
himself to have said to the ladies whom he called
&ldquo;skirts.&rdquo; Then nice Lord Chisholm came all the way from
England into my memory to assist me in my difficulty. I translated
from him freely in this manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, on me word, you <em>are</em> a ripping good sort and
I could take you on for the whole evening if you&rsquo;d let me.
What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; she answered and by that time I
had thought out a nice little squeeze for her very pretty waist in
its silver girdle under my arm. Then I had to put her into the arms
of a nice young man named Miles Menefee. To get my breath and to
think up some more of the compliments that had been given to me for
my pleasure in the past, I made my retreat behind a very large palm
that was in the corner of the room, and out upon a wide balcony
which hung over a moonlit garden across which I could see dim hills
in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls of all nations are granddaughters of the same
Monsieur Satan, I suspect,&rdquo; I made remark to myself as I
inhaled the perfume of the flower garments of the spring garden
below. &ldquo;I must take a great care that I do
not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, boy, you&rsquo;ll slip on the thin ice when you
least expect it,&rdquo; came in the deep voice of the Gouverneur
Faulkner from a shadow at my elbow. &ldquo;I sometimes think that
they love us just to double-cross our life&rsquo;s ambitions, but
don&rsquo;t you begin to suspect that for years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s life must be rooted in the heart of a woman
if it would bear fruit, Monsieur le Gouverneur,&rdquo; I found
myself saying as in the person of the Roberta, Marquise of Grez and
Bye, I drew myself to my full height with pride in defense of my
own sex. &ldquo;A man doubts that to his own dishonor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it must be a pure heart that nourishes a man to
his full fruitage&mdash;and, boy, don&rsquo;t you take even a
sip&mdash;until you are sure there are such founts of
refreshment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would that you could look into my heart, my Gouverneur
Faulkner,&rdquo; I said as I raised my hand and laid it against the
raven garment that covered my soft breast that was rent with pain
at the sadness of his voice and his deep eyes. &ldquo;There you
would see the heart of one&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly I stopped in the
deepest dismay and the daredevil quaked in her trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would probably see the heart of&mdash;shall I say,
Galahad Junior? God bless you, boy, you are refreshing.&rdquo; And
he laughed as he laid his strong hands on my shoulder and gave to
me a good shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you my comrade Launcelot?&rdquo; I asked him with a
sudden fierce pain again in my breast under the raven coat at the
thought of what that Queen of the yellow hair had done to that
brave Knight of the Round Table of King Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll answer your&mdash;your
impertinence, boy. Just keep foxing with Sue and Belle and the rest
of the posy girls and&mdash;and keep away from the
pools&mdash;of&mdash;of other eyes.&rdquo; And after another
shaking he turned me towards the door of that ballroom of lights
and music.</p>
<p>At the command of the Gouverneur Faulkner there was nothing I
could do but go back to the ballroom and to float for more minutes
in the land of cloud with the &ldquo;girl bunch,&rdquo; as my
friend that Buzz has named them; but at supper I took my seat at
the table with that beautiful Madam Whitworth and her husband of
the very drooping black mustache and eyes that looked at all places
except into those of the person addressing him. And at that moment
I made this resolve to myself: &ldquo;That Gouverneur Launcelot may
ride far out of the white road, but I intend to run at his
stirrup.&rdquo; And I found that it required swift running, for the
road led&mdash;shall I say&mdash;into &ldquo;tall
timbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is with a burning of countenance that arises from a hot
shame, which I do not even to this moment exactly understand, that
I recall to my mind that half hour which Mr. Robert Carruthers of
Grez and Bye spent with the beautiful Madam Patricia Whitworth in
one of the deep windows that looked from the private study of His
Excellency of the State of Harpeth, over into the great hills that
surround the city. Things happened in this wise: That Madam
Whitworth made the commencement of our duel of intelligences by
assuming that I was a simple French infant before whom she could
dangle the very sweet bonbon of affection and take away from it a
treasure that it held in the hollow of its hand as a sacred trust.
That Madam Whitworth did not realize that instead of a very small
young boy from gay Paris, whose eyes were closed like those of a
very young cat, she was dealing with the very wicked girl who
placed the word &ldquo;devil&rdquo; behind the word
&ldquo;dare,&rdquo; speaking in the language of that Mr. Willie
Saint Louis when he informed me that he was the man who had so
placed the &ldquo;go&rdquo; behind Chicago while on a visit to that
city. I was that girl.</p>

<h3>VITRIOL AND THE HOODOO</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is absurd for a staid old matron like myself
to be jealous, really jealous, at seeing a child like you being
consumed alive by a lot of simpering misses in pink and blue
chiffon pinafores, who ought to be in their nursery cots asleep,
but I have been and am, boy. Did you forget that I was your oldest
friend while Sue Tomlinson fed you sweets out of her hand?&rdquo;
And as she spoke she seated herself in the exact center of the
window seat and motioned me to place myself in the portion of the
left side that remained. I inserted myself into the space that was
so indicated and laid my arm along the window ledge behind her very
much undressed back, so that I might give to my lungs space to
expand for air. I think that arrangement made very much for the
comfort of the beautiful Madam Patricia, for she immediately
appropriated that arm as a cushion for her undraped shoulders. We
being thus comfortably wedged, the warfare began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All week I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you, you
wonderful boy, and wondering just what you have been doing and what
has been doing to you. The General is so&mdash;so incomprehensible
in his attitude towards you and yours. All these years he has
been&rdquo;&mdash;and as she spoke she looked up into my eyes and
pressed slightly towards me&mdash;&ldquo;uncompromising,
hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madam, I do find my Uncle, the General Robert, to
be, as you say, uncompromising,&rdquo; I answered as I looked down
at her with a smile. &ldquo;But you are not like that, are you,
beautiful Madam Whitworth? You will compromise yourself, will you
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use English words so carelessly, my dear,
until you are less ignorant of their meaning,&rdquo; she reproved
me as she sat erect and gave to my lungs an inch more breathing
space. I had heard that large lady of the State of Cincinnati on
the ship say that a nice lady from a place called Kansas, and whom
everyone gave the title of Mrs. Grass because of a disagreeable
husband who was not dead, &ldquo;compromised&rdquo; herself with a
very much drinking gentleman from Boston because she sat in a small
space with him behind the chimney for smoke from the engine, and I
thought it was a nice word to fit into the conversation with Madam
Whitworth at that time. And I think it did fit better than I had
quite intended that it should. I saw offense and I hastened to make
a peace so that I should learn all that I wanted to know from her
while letting her learn all that I did not know from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg that you pardon me, beautiful Madam, and teach me
the English words to say that will express all of&mdash;of the most
wonderful things that I think of you. What is the one word that
expresses the beauty of the blue flowers in crystal that I said
your eyes to be, to myself, the first time I looked into them upon
that railroad train when you rescued me from the black taffeta
lady?&rdquo; And as I was at that moment speaking the exact truth I
spoke with a great ardor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think that offsets Sue Tomlinson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;cream jug&rsquo; compliment&mdash;and you <em>are</em> a
dear,&rdquo; she answered as she again diminished the space for my
lung action. &ldquo;I hear the dear General has turned you over to
the Governor completely. What do you think of him?&rdquo; she asked
as if to manufacture conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was made a gift to him last week, and I do not
think very much of that Gouverneur,&rdquo; I made answer with
excellent falseness, because I had had no thoughts since my
presentation to that Gouverneur Faulkner that were not of him. I
had obtained the uncomplimentary remark upon the ship, from the
lady of Cincinnati, who said it about the doctor of the seasickness
from which she suffered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between you and me, boy&mdash;if anything, even an
opinion, can be wedged between us&mdash;I think the Governor is a
great, overrated stupid, encouraged in his denseness by the dear
General whose ideas have&mdash;have&mdash;er&mdash;rather
solidified with age. I rather pity you for having to have all of
your opinions and policies of life moulded by them. Yes, it is a
pity.&rdquo; And she sighed very near to my cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you not mould me to some extent yourself, beautiful
flower-eyed Madam?&rdquo; I asked of her with great gentleness, and
did administer a nice little pressure to her shoulders like I had
adventured upon the waist of the beautiful Belle in blue and silver
dress which Madam Whitworth had named a pinafore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a perfect dear, and I will help you all I can.
Just come and tell me all of your difficulties and I&rsquo;ll try
and smooth them away for you. I suppose you will find it easy to
translate their French documents for them about this very boring
mule deal. I have had to do it and I am glad to turn the burden of
it all over to you. You may have some trouble with the English
technicalities and perhaps you had best bring them in to me and
I&rsquo;ll run over them to see that you get them straight. Only
don&rsquo;t let the General know that I am helping you, for I
verily believe the old dear thinks I am a nihilist ready to blow
the Governor or any of his other old mules into a thousand
bits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, beautiful Madam Whitworth, for your offer of
assistance, and I will avail myself of it at the first opportunity.
Is it at your house that we can be alone?&rdquo; I questioned with
a daring smile that would serve both for a purpose of coquetry and
also to ascertain if I would encounter in a call upon her that very
disagreeable appearing gentleman, Mr. Jefferson Whitworth, who is
the husband to his very beautiful wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come any afternoon at four o&rsquo;clock and telephone me
before you come so that I can get rid of anybody who happens to be
around. And be sure to bring any work you have for me to help you
with. That&rsquo;s the only way I can excuse an ancient matron like
myself for keeping you even for a few minutes away from the
pinafores.&rdquo; And she looked into my eyes with a sigh for her
antiquity. In the language of that Mr. Willie Saint Louis I knew it
was &ldquo;up to me,&rdquo; and I &ldquo;handed the dame
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my country, beautiful Madam, the fruit is much more
regarded than the bud,&rdquo; is what I presented to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are delicious,&rdquo; she laughed as she again
diminished my breathing space. &ldquo;I cannot see why the dear
General has been so violent in his prejudice against all things
from France. You must try to win him over, especially as he is
letting his prejudice to France, if you can call downright hatred
that, stand in the way of lending his aid in doing a great service
to your poor, struggling, brave army, while at the same time
reaping a profit to his own State. Has he told you anything of this
mule deal he is forcing Governor Faulkner to hold up on some others
who want to do a service to France?&rdquo; As she questioned me,
the beautiful Madam&rsquo;s eyes became much narrower and I could
observe that she watched me with intentness for any sign of
intelligence. I gave her none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you not tell me, my Madam of the blue flower eyes,
about all of the matter? It will be of great benefit to me to
understand it all from you, for my Uncle the General Robert is a
man of few words and I am not a man of much business
intelligence.&rdquo; And as I spoke I regarded her with a great and
beseeching humility.</p>
<p>And there, in the Mansion of the Gouverneur of the State of
Harpeth himself, that lovely woman did unfold to me the most
wonderful plan for the most enormous robbery of both her own
government and mine&mdash;or should I say of both of my
governments?&mdash;that it could be in the power of mortal mind to
conceive. It was a beautiful, reasonable, generous, patriotic,
sympathetic drama of the gigantic war mule and it had only one
tiny, hidden obscure line in one of its verses, but in that line
lay all of dishonor that could come to a man and a State who should
allow a smaller nation fighting for its life and its honor to be
defrauded of one of the supplies which were of a deadly necessity
for its success. I think I even saw the dastardly scheme more
plainly than did my Uncle, the General Robert, for I had listened
with more than one ear while my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles,
explained to wee Pierre some of the details of supplying the army
of the Republique. I think he had talked of things that the little
one could not understand just to make an ease of the pressure of
all of his business upon his troubled mind and breaking heart. And
as Madam Whitworth talked I could hear my Pierre&rsquo;s brave
voice as he always gave assurances to his sad idol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of plenty is in America, and she will give to
France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here sat great strong Roberta, the Marquise of Grez and Bye,
holding in the hollow of her arm a beautiful American woman who had
herself contrived a monstrous plan to let a quantity of the
lifeblood of France to turn into gold for her own vain uses. If to
throttle her then and there with my bare strong hands had insured
the great big needful mules to France, and saved the honor of my
Gouverneur of the State of Harpeth, and my Uncle, the General
Robert, I think I might have had a great temptation to administer
that death to her; but instead I held her now closer in my arm and
I began to plot her to death in any other way I could discover, so
that her intrigue should die with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a truth, beautiful Madam, the poor old Uncle, the
General Robert, must not be allowed to interfere with such a
beautiful plan as you have for supplying those very fine strong
mules from the State of Harpeth to poor struggling France, and I
will join with you in convincing the stupid Gouverneur Faulkner
that such must not be the case. You will direct me, will you not? I
am very young and I have but so lately come to this land that I do
not know&mdash;I do not feel exactly what you call at home.&rdquo;
And I spoke again with beseeching humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it for France together, boy,&rdquo; she
whispered as she turned in my arm and pressed herself against my
raven attire above my heart held in restraint by that towel of the
bath. &ldquo;And then you can claim from me
any&mdash;reward&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at this lovely moment, when the beautiful Madam Whitworth
had thrown herself into my arms and I had been obliged by my
cunning to hold her there instead of flinging her to the floor as I
naturally desired, there arrived at the door of the room which we
were occupying with our plotting, my tall and awful Uncle, the
General Robert, and looked down upon us with the lightnings of a
storm in his eyes. Then, before I could make exclamation and betray
his presence to the lady in my arms, whose back was turned in his
direction, he had disappeared. Did I betray that presence to the
lady? I did not. I decided that it would be much to the advantage
of the affair to have the lady in ignorance of his knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go now, boy,&rdquo; she said at about the moment
in which I could no longer keep my dissembling alive. &ldquo;Send
the Governor in here to me, for it is about the time I had promised
to dance with him. I want to talk with him and try to make him see
some at least of this matter in the right light. Go; and come to me
to-morrow at four&mdash;for&mdash;for France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went and it was with much joy in the going. I stopped at a
tall window to get into my lungs a very deep supply of atmosphere
and also to take counsel with myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Robert Carruthers,&rdquo; I said to myself,
&ldquo;you are in what that Mr. G. Slade of Detroit said to be a
&lsquo;hell of a fix&rsquo; when the nice aunt of that beautiful
and refined &lsquo;skirt&rsquo; of Saint Joseph, Missouri,
discovered her to be in his embrace of farewell. I cannot tell to
my Uncle, the General Robert, that it is that I, a woman of honor,
have planned for myself, a man of dishonor, to betray a woman into
his hands, and I shall receive from him what that Buzz Clendenning
calls to be a &lsquo;dressing down.&rsquo; But I must go to send to
Madam Delilah now the great Gouverneur of the State of Harpeth and
for what she does to him that is unholy she will answer to Robert
Carruthers or&mdash;or Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye.&rdquo;
And then immediately I went to deliver the summons of Madam
Whitworth to the Gouverneur Faulkner and I did not look into his
face as I spoke the words, but waited with my eyes cast down to the
floor until he dismissed me.</p>
<p>Then after that very painful hour of intrigue I allowed to Mr.
Robert Carruthers another of very delightful gayety with all of the
&ldquo;chiffon pinafore&rdquo; ladies upon the ballroom floor. I
have in my blood that gayety which led some of my ancestors to
laugh and compliment each other and play piquet up even to the edge
of the guillotine, and I refused to see the countenance of my
Uncle, the General Robert, regarding me from the door in the end of
the ballroom. I considered that an hour of pleasure was a sacred
thing not to be interfered with, and I danced with that sweet Sue
Tomlinson right past the edge of his toes while I could feel the
delicious giggle within her, which was answering that within me, at
his fierce regard of us both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll eat you up before daylight, Mr.
Carruthers,&rdquo; she said as she cast a sweet and loving glance
at my Uncle, the General Robert, which, I could see as I lowered
her over my arm and slid away from him, was giving to him much nice
fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will request that Madam black Kizzie to make a good
cream gravy to me,&rdquo; I made answer to her with merriment.
&ldquo;I am very tender,&rdquo; I added with audacity that I was
learning with such a rapidity that I trembled for the reputation of
Mr. Robert Carruthers, and as I spoke the words I gave to her a
little embrace in a turn of the dance. It should not have been
done, but if that sweet Sue had known that a very lonely girl
danced in that raven garb of a man, who wanted to hold her close
for her comforting, she would have forgiven it, I feel sure. That
Sue is a young woman of such a good sense that I must forever
cherish her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that again, Bobby Carruthers,&rdquo; she
said, looking up at me with a lovely seriousness in her honest
young eyes. &ldquo;I know you are French, and queer, but&mdash;but
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; After a little she added: &ldquo;We are
going to be grand friends, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,
lovely Sue, and I beg of you pardon,&rdquo; I answered her with all
of the friendliness of Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, in my
eyes and voice, which seemed to give to her a beautiful
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I&rsquo;ll tell you what let&rsquo;s do. You come
by for me to-morrow afternoon and I&rsquo;ll go with you to the
Capitol and I&rsquo;ll beard the General Lion in his den and ask
him to let us be friends, and then we&rsquo;ll take him out to the
Confederate Soldiers&rsquo; Home for &lsquo;flags
down&rsquo;&mdash;it mellowed him so once, when I was about ten,
that he let me trot home beside him holding his hand, though he
didn&rsquo;t speak to me for a week after. Want to?&rdquo; I did
enjoy the mischief in those merry eyes that I laughed into.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll steal his big car and come and help
you&mdash;what do you say?&mdash;kidnap my Uncle, the General
Robert,&rdquo; I answered her with delight as I released her into
the arms of that Buzz Clendenning before the fox had been more than
half trotted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go pick roses out of your own garden,
L&rsquo;Aiglon,&rdquo; he said as he slid her away from me.</p>
<p>And for the reason that I was very slightly fatigued and also
slightly warm from being obliged to dance in the very heavy
swathings of a gentleman, when I had been accustomed to the
coolness of chiffon and tulle and thin lace of a lady, I went again
into the broad hall and to the wide window that looked away to
those comforting blue hills. Below me the garden was coming out of
a veil of mist as the moon, which was now very old, came slowly up
from behind the dim ridge of hills that my Uncle the General Robert
had told me to be called Paradise Ridge. All the spring flowers
below me seemed to be sending up to me greetings of perfumes and
the tall purple and white lilac flowers waved plumes of
friendliness at me, while large round pink blossoms that I think
are called peonies, nodded and beckoned to me with sweet
countenances. I felt that they were flower friends who in their
turn were saying messages of welcome to the lonely girl who had
come across the dark waters to them and in my throat I began to hum
that &ldquo;Say can you see&mdash;&rdquo; Star Spangled hymn to
them, and was just preparing to step from the window onto a balcony
and descend to them, when a movement of human beings caught my eye
upon the side of that balcony and I paused in the darkness of the
window curtain. What did I see?</p>
<p>A man stood at the rail of the balcony in the dim moonlight and
he was speaking to a woman whom his broad shoulders hid from me.
The man was the Gouverneur Faulkner of the State of Harpeth and in
a moment I discovered the identity of the lady with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, can&rsquo;t you see, you great big stupid man,
what an opportunity I have procured for all of you?&rdquo; was the
question that came in the soft voice of the beautiful Madam
Patricia Whitworth. &ldquo;All my life I have worked just to get a
little ease and comfort, carrying the burden of Jeff in his
incompetency strapped to my shoulders, and now you, who know how
I&rsquo;ve suffered and slaved, are going to take it all from me
when it is just within my reach, and all from no earthly reason
than a fancied scruple of honor which that old doddering
woman-hater imposes on you. I cannot believe that you would so
treat me.&rdquo; And there were sobs in her words that were wooing
and compelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot do a thing that my Secretary of State and his
lawyers declare unconstitutional, Patricia,&rdquo; answered the
voice of the Gouverneur Faulkner, in which were notes of pain.
&ldquo;You know how it pains me&mdash;my God, don&rsquo;t tempt me
to&mdash;&rdquo; His voice shook as I saw the beautiful, bare white
arms of Madam Whitworth raise themselves and go about his neck like
great white grappling hooks from which he was unable to defend
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to have nothing from life&mdash;no ease or luxury
and no&mdash;love or&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice ended in sobs as she
pressed her head down into his shoulder as his arm folded about her
to prevent that she should fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patricia&mdash;&rdquo; the deep voice of the strong man
was beginning to say as I was starting to spring forward in his
defense and to do&mdash;I do not know what&mdash;when a firm grasp
was laid upon my shoulder and I was turned away from the window
into the light of the wide hall and found my Uncle, the General
Robert, looking down into my flashing eyes with a great and very
cool calmness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he said as he gave to me a very
powerful shake, &ldquo;all women are poison but some are vitriol
and others just&mdash;Oh, well, paregoric. Go out there and take
another dose of that soothing syrup labeled Susan Tomlinson, before
I take you home, and
you&mdash;keep&mdash;away&mdash;from&mdash;vitriol&mdash;or&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;break&mdash;your&mdash;hot&mdash;young&mdash;
head. Vitriol, mind you!&rdquo; With which command my Uncle, the
General Robert, strode down the hall in the direction of the
smoking room and left me blinking in the lights of the wide
hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Mas&rsquo; Robert,&rdquo; came in a soft voice at
my elbow as I stood tottering, &ldquo;is you got a picture of
yo&rsquo; mudder you could show Cato some day when the General
ain&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo;. &rsquo;Fore I dies I wants to set my
eyes on de woman dat drawed little Mas&rsquo; Henry away from us
all. Dey <em>is</em> such a thing in dis hard old world as love
what you goes &rsquo;crost many waters&rsquo; to git, and he
shorely got it.&rdquo; And I looked into the eyes of that old black
man to find a truth that all the white humans about me, myself
included, were acting in the terms of a lie.</p>
<p>Before I could answer the old man, in through the window came
the Gouverneur Faulkner and the beautiful Madam Whitworth, and from
his white face set in sternness and hers with its smile of the
opening rose upon its red mouth I could not tell whether his honor
had been slain or had been spared for another round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll want you in my office at the Capitol at eleven
to-morrow, Robert,&rdquo; he said to me, and there was a cold
sternness in his glance as they passed by me and the old Cato into
the ballroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At four,&rdquo; murmured the beautiful Madam Whitworth as
she swept past me with a soft smile but in a tone of voice too low
for any ears save my own and I think of the old Cato&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>For a very short moment the old black man detained me as he
searched one of the pockets of his long gray coat and then he
handed to me a tiny flat parcel apparently folded in some kind of
thin red cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wear that in your left shoe, honey, day and night.
You&rsquo;ll need it if she&rsquo;s got her eye on you,&rdquo; he
said as he hurried away from me into the smoking room.</p>
<p>After disrobing that night, or rather in the early morning of
the following day, I investigated the contents of that package. In
it were a gray feather off of an apparently very nice chicken, a
very old and rusty pin bent in two places and a flat little black
seed I had never before beheld.</p>
<p>I gazed at the package for several long moments, then I put back
upon my left foot the silk sock I had removed, placed the token of
old Cato within it under my heel, dived into that large bed of my
ancestors and in the darkness covered up my head tightly with the
silk comforter.</p>

<h3>BUSINESS AND PIE</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>That Mr. Buzz Clendenning has in the composition of his nature a
very large portion of nice foolishness which makes the heart of a
lonely person most comfortable. He decided, upon that very first
day of our introduction, that I was to be as a small brother to him
who was much loved but also to be much joked about a quaintness
which he chose to call &ldquo;French greenness,&rdquo; and for
which I was most grateful because with that excuse I could cover
all mistakes that arose from my being a girl who was ignorant of
the exact methods of being a man. And, also, that nice attitude
towards me was of quite a contagion, for all of the young ladies
and gentlemen of the city of Hayesville became the same to me and
all of the time my heart was warm and rejoiced at their affection
shown in banter and jokes.</p>
<p>The morning after that very much enjoyed dinner dance, with
which the Governor Faulkner complimented my Uncle, the General
Robert, through me, I was standing in front of the mirror in my
room without my coat or my collar, endeavoring to reduce the wave
in my black hair to the sleekness of that of my beloved Buzz, which
had a difficulty because of one lock over my temple whose
waywardness I had for the last few years trained to fall upon my
cheek for purposes of coquetry and which would persist in trying
still to fulfill that unworthy function. And right in the center of
my punishment of that lovelock with the stiff brush without a
handle, which was twins with another that had come with the
gentleman&rsquo;s traveling bag which I had purchased in New York
of the nice fat gentleman in the store of clothing for men, into my
room came that Buzz without any ceremony save a rap upon my door
which did not allow sufficient time for any response from me. I
blushed with alarm at the thought that his entrance might have come
at a much earlier stage of my toilet and I made a resolve to lock
the door tight in future, at the same time turning to greet him
with a fine and great composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Bobby, are you in for side-stepping the chiefs at
eleven-thirty and going with me to take a nice bunch of calicoes
out to the Country Club for a little midday sandwich dance? You can
eat a thin ham and fox trot at the same time. Sue and Belle and
Kate Keith all want to get on to that long slide you&rsquo;ve
brought over direct from Paree. It stuck in their systems last
evening and they want more. Want to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a greatness of pleasure, but His Excellency has
commanded me at eleven o&rsquo;clock and will I be through the
tasks at the hour for escorting those calicoes out to your Club for
a dance?&rdquo; I asked with great delight as I continued my
operations with the brush upon the rebellious lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have time if you stop that primping and
hustle into your collar and coat. Here, let me show you how to
doctor that place where the cow licked you. Why don&rsquo;t you
take both brushes to it? Like this!&rdquo; With which Mr. Buzz took
from my hand the one brush and from the high dressing table the
other, for which my ignorance had discovered no use, and did then
commence a vigorous assault on my enemy the curl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it you said of a cow, my Buzz?&rdquo; I
questioned him as I made a squirming under the vigor of his attack
upon my hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When hair acts up like this we call it a cowlick in
United States language. See here, L&rsquo;Aiglon, old boy, this
hair looks as if it had at one time been curled. Did you wear it
that way in Paris?&rdquo; And as he asked the question he gave that
side of my hair one more vigorous sweep and stood off to admire his
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my Buzz, I assure you that it was the cruelty of that
cow you mention, while I was at a very tender age,&rdquo; I
answered with a laugh into his eyes that covered nicely the blush
that rose to my cheek at his accusation concerning the
lovelock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, knot that tie now in a jiffy and climb into your
coat. Let&rsquo;s get to the Capitol and give the old boys as
little of our attention as they&rsquo;ll stand for, and then beat
it for the girls. Bet my chief growls blue blazes at me over the
way Sue ragged him about you last night. He&rsquo;ll issue a
command at the point of the bayonet to me to keep you away from the
bunch, and I&rsquo;ll agree just so as to make the slide from under
easy. Come on.&rdquo; And while he spoke to me, that Buzz raced me
down the hall of my ancestors and out into his very slim, fast car
before I could get breath for speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose His Excellency the Gouverneur Faulkner
requires my presence beyond that half hour after eleven
o&rsquo;clock, my Buzz, is it that you will await me for a few
short minutes?&rdquo; I asked of him as we ascended the steps of
the Capitol of the State of Harpeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bill won&rsquo;t keep you any longer than that.
He&rsquo;ll have twenty other interviews on the string for to-day.
Fifteen minutes will be about right for you; you wait for me in the
General&rsquo;s anteroom. I&rsquo;ll have to get heroics before
instructions. I always do. Now beat it.&rdquo; With which words my
Buzz left me in the wide hall of the great Capitol before a door
marked: &ldquo;Office of the Governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon that door I knocked and it was immediately opened to me by
fine black Cato, whose eyes shone in recognition of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it in yo&rsquo; shoe?&rdquo; he demanded in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my good Cato,&rdquo; I responded also in a low tone
of voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Den pass on in to de Governor; he am waitin&rsquo; fer
you. You&rsquo;s safe, chile.&rdquo; And he escorted me past
several gentlemen seated and standing in groups, to another door,
which he opened for me and through which he motioned me to
pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Robert Carruthers,&rdquo; he announced me with the
greatest ceremony. &ldquo;Go in, honey,&rdquo; he said softly and I
passed into the room whose door he closed quietly behind me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Robert,&rdquo; said the Gouverneur Faulkner
to me as I came and stood opposite him at the edge of his wide
desk. And he smiled at me with a great gentleness that had also
humor playing into it from the corners of his eyes and mouth.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that you&rsquo;ve landed in the midst of a
genuine case of American hustle this &lsquo;morning after.&rsquo;
Here are two lists of specifications, one in English weights and
measurements and the other in French. I want you to compare them
carefully, checking them as you go and then re-checking them. I
want to be sure they are the same. Also make a good literal
translation of any notes that may be in French and compare them
with the notes in English. Do you think it can be done for me by
three o&rsquo;clock, in time for a conference I have at that
hour?&rdquo; With which request he, the Gouverneur Faulkner, handed
me two large sheets of paper down which were many long columns of
figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu</em>,&rdquo; I said to myself under my
breath, for always I have had to count out the pieces of money
necessary to give to Nannette for the washer of the linen at the
Chateau de Grez, upon the fingers of my hands, which often seemed
too few to furnish me sufficient aid. But in a small instant I had
recovered my courage, which brought with it a determination to do
that task if it meant my death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Excellency,&rdquo; I answered him with a great
composure in the face of the tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the small office between my office and
that of General Carruthers empty. A ring of the bell under the desk
means for you to come to me. I&rsquo;ll try not to interrupt you.
Two rings means to go to the General. That is about all.&rdquo;
With a wave of his hand the Gouverneur Faulkner dismissed me to my
death.</p>
<p>With my head up in the air I turned from him and prepared to
retire to my prison from which I could see no release, when again I
heard his summons. He had risen and was standing beside his desk
and as I turned he held out his hand into which I laid mine as he
drew me near to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Youngster,&rdquo; he said and the smile which all persons
call cold was all of gentleness into my eyes, &ldquo;these are
going to be some hard days for us all, these next ten, and if I
drive you too hard, balk, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the death for you I&rsquo;ll go, my Gouverneur
Faulkner,&rdquo; I answered him, looking straight into his tired
eyes that were so deep under the black, silver-tipped wings of his
brows. I did not mean that death I had threatened myself from the
mathematics in the paper, but in my heart there was something that
rose and answered the sadness in his eyes with again all that
savageness of a barbarian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take you to the point of
demise&mdash;almost&mdash;if I need you,&rdquo; he answered me with
a laugh that hid a quiver of emotion in his voice as something that
was like unto a spark shot from the depths of his eyes into the
depths of mine. &ldquo;Go get the papers verified and let me know
when you have finished.&rdquo; And this time I was in reality
dismissed. I went; but in my heart was a strange smoulder that the
spark had kindled.</p>
<p>In the small room that opened off of that of the Gouverneur
Faulkner, with a door that I knew to lead into the room of my
Uncle, the General Robert, I seated myself at a table by a window
which looked down upon the city spread at the foot of the Capitol
hill lying shimmering in the young spring mists that drifted across
its housetops. I laid down the papers, took a pencil from a tray
close beside my hand and then faced the most dreadful of any
situation that I had ever brought down upon my own head. I also
faced at the same time the smiling countenance of my Buzz, who
looked into the door from the room of my Uncle, the General Robert,
slipped through that door and closed it gently behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe on first base! The old boy of the bayonets has been
called to the Governor and he&rsquo;ll not be back before they both
have luncheon sent in to them. I have taken his letters and now
I&rsquo;m off. What did Bill hand you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death and also destruction,&rdquo; I answered in an
expletive often used by my father in times of a catastrophe, and
with those words I showed to my Buzz the two long papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoo, that&rsquo;s no big job. I looked over and verified
this one myself yesterday in ten minutes. Hello, this other one is
in French. Just run it through and if it is to tally, call it; and
I&rsquo;ll hold this one. We can do it in fifteen minutes. Go ahead
from the top line across.&rdquo; And my Buzz held the paper in his
hand as he seated himself in readiness upon the corner of my desk
beside me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my Buzz, I have such a mortification that I cannot
add one to another of these long figures. When I place one number
to another I must use my fingers, and in this case you see that it
is impossible.&rdquo; Tears I did not allow in my eyes, but they
were in my voice, and I looked into the eyes of my Buzz with a
great terror. &ldquo;What is it that I shall do? I am in
disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You complete edition of a kid, you, don&rsquo;t you know
I can do it for you? That is, if you know what all these kilo
things stand for in English. Do you?&rdquo; As he spoke, that kind
Buzz put his hand on my shoulder with a nice rough shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know from my governess, Madam Fournet, and I will
write it all down for you, my Buzz, for whom I feel so much
gratitude for help,&rdquo; I answered with quickness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stow the gratitude and write &rsquo;em all out. It will
take us about an hour but it is good to keep calicoes waiting
occasionally,&rdquo; he said, and did thereupon seat himself beside
the table and draw to himself the two sheets of paper, while I
quickly wrote out the table of French weights and measurements
translated into English.</p>
<p>I did very much enjoy that hour in which my Buzz labored with a
pencil and a great industry while I called to him the list of long
figures and then verified as he showed me the units upon the page
in the French language. He made jokes at me between workings while
he attended his cigarette and we, together, had much laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are just three places where these figures disagree
and I have marked them carefully, L&rsquo;Aiglon,&rdquo; he said as
at last he laid down both pieces of the paper. &ldquo;These French
specifications and figures that floored you, represent the ideal
mule in bulk and these United States figures promise the same
multitude in scrub. I thought as much. You just run in there to
Bill with them and then forget you ever saw them, and we&rsquo;ll
be on our way to the girls in ten minutes. Bobby, I mean it when I
say that men in your and my positions of trust just forget facts
and figures the minute we get out of sight of our chiefs. And we
forget the chiefs too, believe me. Now run along and come out to
the car on the same trot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it of honor not to tell to the Gouverneur Faulkner
that you assisted me in this task, my Buzz?&rdquo; I asked of him
with anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to tell him&mdash;it&rsquo;s all in the same
office and will come to me for filing. Don&rsquo;t say anything
that will bring on talk that keeps us from Sue and the gang. Just
run!&rdquo; With which advice my kind Buzz disappeared through the
door into the office of my Uncle, the General Robert, as I softly
opened the door of the room of the Gouverneur Faulkner and entered
into his presence. And in that presence I found also my Uncle, the
General Robert, in a very grave consultation with the Gouverneur
Faulkner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The papers completed, Your Excellency,&rdquo; I said in a
very low and meek tone of my voice as I laid the papers beside him
on the table and prepared to take the running departure that my
Buzz had commanded of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul, are you here and at work, young man? I
thought you were asleep after all that gallivanting, and was just
preparing to blow you up out of bed over the telephone,&rdquo;
exclaimed my Uncle, the General Robert, with great fierceness of
manner but also a great pleasure of eyes at the sight of me in the
character of such a nice Secretary to the Gouverneur of
Harpeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert arrived five minutes after I did and ten minutes
before you came into the building, General,&rdquo; said that
Gouverneur Faulkner, with a twinkle of great enjoyment in his eyes.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done a day&rsquo;s work before we have begun.
Will you have your luncheon sent up from the restaurant with ours,
Robert? Just order the usual things for us and any kind of frills
you care for. Shall I say snails?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank Your Excellency deeply but I am engaged that I
luncheon and dance with Mr. Buzz Clendenning in his club in the
country if I may be given permission to go,&rdquo; I answered as I
laid my fingers with affection on the arm of my Uncle, the General
Robert, as I stood beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, sir! You&rsquo;ll not join those jackanapes in
their gambols during business hours. Order yourself up a slice of
pie and a glass of buttermilk along with mine and sit down here to
listen to matters of business by which you can profit. Luncheon and
dancing! No, pie and business, I say, pie and business!&rdquo; And
the fierceness of my Uncle, the General Robert, made me retire
several feet away from him in astonishment and in the direction of
the Gouverneur Faulkner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, General, don&rsquo;t tie the boy down to pie and the
company of two musty old gentlemen like ourselves. He&rsquo;s
earned a dance. You may go, Robert, and I wish&mdash;I wish my
heels were light enough to go with yours,&rdquo; that kind
Gouverneur said in my behalf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light heels, light head! And I say he shall&mdash;&rdquo;
And another explosion of fierceness was about to arrive from my
Uncle, the General Robert, when I said with great and real
humility:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be my great pleasure to sit at the feet of you
and His Excellency, which are not light for dancing, my Uncle
Robert, and eat a large piece of pie and also milk.&rdquo; I spoke
with a sincerity, for suddenly I knew that there would be nothing
at that dance of girls in the club of my Buzz that I would so
desire as to sit near to that Gouverneur Faulkner, in whose eyes
came that sadness when he spoke of the dance for which he had not
the light feet, and eat with him and my Uncle, the General Robert,
a piece of that American pie of which I had heard my father speak
many times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he means it, General,&rdquo; said the Gouverneur
Faulkner with a great softness in his eyes that answered the
affection that was in mine that pleaded for the pie and a place at
his side. &ldquo;Run, youngster, run, before the General says
another word. You are dismissed. Go!&rdquo; And with a great laugh
the Gouverneur Faulkner rose, put his arm around my shoulder and
put me out of that room before my Uncle, the General Robert, could
begin any more words of remonstrance. And I ran away from that door
to my Buzz in the waiting car with both light and reluctant
feet.</p>
<p>The two hours that I spent with my Buzz at his club in the
country with what he called in front of their very faces, bunches
of calico, passed with such a rapidity that I felt I must grasp
each minute and remonstrate with them for their fleetness. That
Mademoiselle Sue was even much more lovely in her gray costume of
golf with a tie the color of the one worn by my Buzz, than she had
been in her chiffon of the dinner dance, and the beautiful Belle
was much the same, with an added gayety and charm, while I
discovered a very sweet Kate Keith and a Mildred Summers who was
not of a great beauty but of many interesting remarks which induced
much laughing. With them were that Miles Menefee whom my Buzz had
recommended to me, and also several young gentlemen of America whom
I liked exceedingly. One Mr. Phillips Taylor took me by my heart
with a great force when, as we were all seated on the steps of the
wide porch eating the promised sandwich and consuming breath for
another dance in a very few minutes, he said to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mr. Robert Carruthers, my mater wants to see you
over in the east card room directly. She says she had it on with
your father in their dancing school days and it was only by the
intervention of some sort of love ruckus that you and I are not
brothers or maybe what would be worse, brother and sister. If that
had happened you would have had to be it. I wouldn&rsquo;t. But
that&rsquo;s not our quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have been a woman unless you had
received a much better finishing polish before being sent to bless
the earth, Phil, dear,&rdquo; said that funny Mademoiselle Mildred
Summers, and that Mr. Phillips Taylor returned the insult by
lifting her off of her feet and gliding her halfway across the
porch verandah in the beginning of one tango dance to the music
that was again to be heard from the hall within the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mildred and Phil fight like aborigines, and their love
for combat will lead to matrimony in their early youth if they are
not reconciled to each other soon,&rdquo; said lovely Sue as she
fitted herself into my arms for our tango.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this dance with you will you lead me to that Madam
Taylor, the friend of my father, beautiful Sue?&rdquo; I asked of
her. &ldquo;It makes happy my heart to see one who loved
him.&rdquo; And as I spoke, the longing for my father that will
ever be in my heart made a sadness in my voice and a dimness in my
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think everybody loved him just as we are all beginning
to&mdash;to like you, Bobby dear,&rdquo; said that sweet girl as
she smiled up at me in a way that sent the dimness in my eyes back
to my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very grateful that you like me, lovely Sue,&rdquo; I
said with great humility. &ldquo;I will endeavor to win and deserve
more and more of that liking, until it is with me as if I had been
born in a house near to yours, as is the case with my dear Buzz and
also that funny Mildred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t like you any better, Bobby, if you had
torn the hair off of my doll&rsquo;s head or broken my slate a
dozen times,&rdquo; she laughed at me again as we slid together the
last slide in the dance. &ldquo;Now come over and be introduced to
Mrs. Taylor. You have only a few minutes, for you and Buzz must
both be back at the Capitol at two. I feel in honor bound to the
State to send you both back on time.&rdquo; And while she spoke she
led me across the hall of the clubhouse and into a room full of
ladies, who sat at card tables consuming very beautiful food while
also preparing to resume playing the cards.</p>
<h2><a id="ChXII" name="ChXII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>
<h3>THE BEAUTIFUL MADAM WHITWORTH</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Sue then made for me many introductions and all of those lovely
<em>grande dames</em> gave to me affectionate welcomes. Some of
them I had encountered at the dance of the Gouverneur Faulkner and
all of them had smiles for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, boy, you are Henry&rsquo;s very self come back to us
after all these years&mdash;only with a lot of added deviltry in
the way of French beauty,&rdquo; said that Madam Taylor, who was
very stately, with white hair and a very young countenance of
sweetness. &ldquo;The daredevil&mdash;it was like him to send you
back to us as&mdash;as revenge,&rdquo; she added with something
that almost seemed like anger under the sweetness of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is what my father always named me, Madam, the
&lsquo;daredevil,&rsquo; and will you not accept me for your
cherishing?&rdquo; I spoke those words to her from an impulse that
I could not understand but I saw them soothe a hurt in her eyes as
she laughed and kissed my cheek as I raised my head from kissing
her jeweled hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered me softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, L&rsquo;Aiglon; it&rsquo;s time to beat it. We
are late and Sue is beginning to shoo,&rdquo; called my Buzz from
the door of the card room. &ldquo;We are coming home with Phil for
supper to-night, Mrs. Taylor, and the Prince wants an introduction
to your custard pie. Yes&rsquo;m, seven sharp! Come on,
Bob!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Buzz,&rdquo; I said to that Mr. Buzz Clendenning as he
raced the slim car through the country and the city up to the
Capitol hill, &ldquo;you give to me a life of much joy in only a
few days. I would that it could so continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just will until we are jolly old boys with long white
beards and canes, Bobby,&rdquo; he answered me with an affectionate
grin as we rounded a corner on two wheels of the car. &ldquo;Say,
let&rsquo;s get out of this politics soon, go in for selling timber
lands, marry two of the calicoes and found families. We&rsquo;ll
call the firm Carruthers and Clendenning and I choose Sue. You can
decide about your dame later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly something very cold and dead was there in place of my
heart that had danced with happiness. What should I do at that time
of disclosing myself as one large lie to all of these kind friends
who were giving me affection on the account of my honored father
and Uncle, the General Robert? That daredevil in me had led me into
this dishonor, with the excuse, it is true, of fear that the wicked
Uncle would not have mended the hip of small Pierre if I did not
obey his summons as a nephew. And now I must stay to be of service
to him and to the Gouverneur Faulkner but also to be more involved
in that lie and to accept more confidence and affection with
thievery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot sell the lands of timber with you, my
Buzz,&rdquo; I made answer to him quickly and with fierceness.
&ldquo;As soon as this business of the mules is settled and my
Uncle, the General Robert, no longer requires my services, I must
return and go into the trenches of France.&rdquo; And I felt as I
spoke that my fate was decided, and a great calmness came over me.
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; answered me that Buzz
with a look of the steadfast affection which might have grown with
years of comradeship. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and fight for France
with you if you&rsquo;ll come back and build an American family
alongside of mine. Jump out&mdash;we are fifteen minutes
late&mdash;and watch the General scalp me. Come in through his
office and take a part of it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even in the very short time which I had known my Uncle, the
General Robert, I had discovered that the times at which could be
anticipated explosions, none came, and also the reverse of that
fact. When my Buzz and I entered his office he very hastily
concealed a book that had some variety of richly colored pictures
in it in his desk and smiled with a wink of the eye at my Buzz.
Later I should know about that book to my great joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter for you, Robert, and go get to your
knitting with Governor Bill,&rdquo; he said to me with kindness in
his smile as he handed me a large letter and motioned me from the
room into the small anteroom that I now knew to be the place
assigned to my Buzz and me when not wanted in the offices of my
Uncle, the General Robert, or the Gouverneur Faulkner. I made a low
bow to my Uncle, the General Robert, and also to Monsieur the
Bumble Bee and departed thence.</p>
<p>On seating myself at my table to await the bell of the
Gouverneur Faulkner, without which ringing my Buzz had instructed
me I must never on pain of extinction as a secretary enter His
Excellency&rsquo;s office, I opened that letter and began to read
with difficulty a letter of a few words from my wee Pierre, now in
the hospital of that kind Doctor Burns. I read not more than one
sentence when I leaped to my feet with a cry of joy and my heart
beat very high with happiness. To whom should I turn to tell of
that happiness? I did not pause to answer that question in my heart
but I quickly opened the door of the august Gouverneur of Harpeth
and presented myself to him in a disobedience of strict orders. And
then what befell me?</p>
<p>Seated at his desk was that great and good man, with his head
bowed upon his hands; and at my entrance he raised that head with
an alarm. I could see that his face was heavy and sad with deep
pondering and I was instantly thrown into mortification that I had
so interrupted him. I faltered there beside him and found halting
words to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is a pardon I ask Your Excellency for intruding
into your door, but it is that my small Pierre has stood upon two
feet for perhaps a whole minute in the hospital of that good Dr.
Burns and I must run to tell you of my joy. Is it quite possible
now that Pierre will no longer be for life crooked in the
back?&rdquo; And as I spoke I held out to him the letter upon which
tears were dripping and one of my hands I clasped trembling at my
breast that shook under that stylish cheviot bag of a coat I had
that morning put upon me for the first time. And did that great
Gouverneur Faulkner repulse his wicked secretary? He did not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, youngster! Of course you run right to tell
me when a big thing like that happens. Sure that back will be all
straight in no time and we&rsquo;ll have the little maid down,
running in and out at her will in just a few months,&rdquo; and as
he spoke that Gouverneur Faulkner came to my side and took the hand
that held the tear-besprinkled letter and also drew the one from my
breast into his own two large and warm ones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
hearing people&rsquo;s troubles for what seems like an eternity,
boy, but not a single son-of-a-gun has run to me with his joy until
you have. Here, use one corner of my handkerchief while I use the
other,&rdquo; and as he spoke that very large and broad-shouldered
man released one of my hands, dabbed his own eyes that were
sparkling with perhaps a tear, and then handed that handkerchief to
me.</p>
<p>And those tears of both of us ended in a large laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my habit that I shed tears when in joy,&rdquo; I
said with apology, as I returned that large white handkerchief to
that Gouverneur Faulkner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you don&rsquo;t tell anybody that Governor Bill
Faulkner does the same thing,&rdquo; he answered with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a feeling that is of longing to rush to small
Pierre and to prostrate myself at the feet of that good
Doctor,&rdquo; I said as again the great joy of that news rushed
upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, boy, not right now,&rdquo; answered that great
Gouverneur Faulkner as he turned and laid a large warm hand on each
of my shoulders. &ldquo;The crisis is at hand and I need you here
for a little time. I can&rsquo;t explain it, but&mdash;but you seem
to feed&mdash;feed my faith in myself. In just a few days
I&rsquo;ve grown to depend on you to&mdash;to&mdash;. You
ridiculous boy, you, with your storms and joy sunbursts, get out of
here and tell Cato to send Mr. Whitworth and Mr. Brown into my
office immediately.&rdquo; And with a laugh and a shake of me away
from his side, the Gouverneur Faulkner picked up the two long
sheets of paper which had been of so much labor to my Buzz and me
and began to scowl back of his black, white-tipped eyebrows over
them. I departed with great rapidity.</p>
<p>Then with much more calmness I told the great news of the back
of Pierre to my Uncle, the General Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine&mdash;now we can give her away without
any trouble. I knew Burns could do the trick. It&rsquo;s a bargain
at two thousand dollars to get a girl in the shape to give away.
She could give us no end of bother if we had to keep her. Go find
that flea, Clendenning, and tell him to come to me immediately; I
think he is buzzing in the telephone closet to that Susan. And you
go get busy yourself to earn your salary from the State of Harpeth.
Telegraph twenty dollars to that fool nurse to buy a doll for the
girl. Now go!&rdquo; That was the way that my Uncle, the General
Robert, received my news of the improved health of the back of
small Pierre, and with my two eyes I shed a few secret tears that
did roll down into my mouth which was broad from a laugh as I went
in search of my Buzz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully, old top,&rdquo; said my Bumble Bee as I imparted
also my joy to him. &ldquo;Say, if that kid is eight years old and
is going to walk all right, we must see to it that she starts in
with a good dancing teacher as soon as she can spin around. We want
to make a real winner out of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do love you, my Buzz,&rdquo; I answered to him as I
clung with both my hands to his arm across my shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Prince, but don&rsquo;t talk
about it,&rdquo; he answered me with a laugh and a shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, say, let&rsquo;s get to work, because at about four
o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;ll have something that&rsquo;ll give you a
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, my Buzz, at four o&rsquo;clock I must go for tea
to the home of beautiful Madam Whitworth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whe-ee-uh!&rdquo; whistled my Buzz as he looked at me
from the top of my head to the toe of my shoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would give me a much greater pleasure to be startled
by you, my Buzz, but this is a promise I did make the last
evening,&rdquo; I pleaded to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, sport, but accept it from me that Madam Pat is
the genuine and original pump; so don&rsquo;t let her empty you. Do
you want me to come by and extract you at about fifteen to five?
I&rsquo;m sorry, but I really must have a business interview with
you before six.&rdquo; And my Buzz&rsquo;s eyes twinkled with
something that was of a great pleasure to him I could observe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be of more pleasure to me if you came at the
half of five, my Buzz,&rdquo; I made a hurry to assure him, for I
had a great dread of all of the falsehoods I was to say to that
Madam Whitworth that afternoon for the purpose of extracting
perhaps a little wicked truth from her to help in the defense of my
Gouverneur Faulkner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on,&rdquo; answered my Buzz promptly.
&ldquo;Beat it! I hear the old boy growling.&rdquo; And he
disappeared behind the door of my Uncle, the General Robert. I went
to the duty of assuring the nice gentleman in very rough clothing
that the Gouverneur would in the morning read the paper on the
subject of making a long road past his property in good condition
by a vote, and I was of a very great success in my efforts, the
good Cato assured me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;s got a fine oiled tongue tied in the middle
and loose at both ends, honey. Yo&rsquo; father had the
same,&rdquo; he assured me as he handed me my hat and walking cane
at the hour of four, which ended my duties for the day. Roberta,
Marquise of Grez and Bye, did so long to go into that room of the
Gouverneur Faulkner and receive upon her hand one nice kiss of good
night from him, but Mr. Robert Carruthers walked down from the
Capitol and only paused to lift for a little second his very
handsome hat towards the window of His Excellency&rsquo;s room high
up above.</p>
<p>And the encounter with the beautiful Madam Whitworth was much
worse than I had thought that it would be, though also it was of a
very interesting excitement. She had made armaments for the
encounter in the shape of a very lovely tea apparel of an
increditable thinness to be used for covering, a little low fire in
the golden grate, and curtains of rose to throw somewhat of glow
over the situation. Immediately I was seated beside her on a small
divan upon which there was room for only one and a half persons,
and my stupidity was called into vigorous action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have spent the day in translating a lot of
those long and tiresome French documents for the General and the
Governor. Thank goodness, that is no longer my task,&rdquo; she
remarked as she tipped the cognac bottle over my tea and handed the
cup to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of a great fatigue to work upon a matter that one
does not at all understand,&rdquo; I answered her as I sipped at
that tea of a very disagreeable taste because of the cognac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they give you the two sets of specifications to
compare?&rdquo; she asked of me with not much of interest apparent
in her manner, though her hand shook as she poured for herself a
very small cup of tea, which was then filled complete with the
cognac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Helas</em>,&rdquo; I answered with a sigh. &ldquo;And
it is impossible for me to add more figures to each other than my
fingers will allow. I cannot even use my toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he didn&rsquo;t get them ready for the conference
this afternoon?&rdquo; she demanded with a great illumination of
joy in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, I handed them back completed to His
Excellency in a short space of time. Is not one mule like to
another exactly, and why should a paper make them different?&rdquo;
I questioned with deceit of stupidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a dear boy,&rdquo; laughed that Madam Whitworth.
&ldquo;Of course those specifications agree, for I worked a whole
day over them; and I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t tire your eyes
out with them. You know you are really a very beautiful creature
and I think I&rsquo;ll kiss you just once, purely for the pleasure
of it.&rdquo; And I thereupon received a kiss upon my lips from the
curled flower which was the mouth of that beautiful Madam
Whitworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that the stupid Gouverneur Faulkner must very soon
sign that paper that sends the many strong mules to carry food to
the soldiers of France fighting in the trenches?&rdquo; I asked of
her as I made her comfortable in the hollow of my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t sign them in a very few days the deal
is all off,&rdquo; she answered me. &ldquo;Jeff has got his capital
to put up from some Northern men who are&mdash;are restless
and&mdash;and suspicious. It must go through and
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must be accomplished immediately,&rdquo; I
answered her with decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The agent of the French Government will be here on
Tuesday and all of these preliminary papers must be signed before
he can close the matter up finally. I hope that the conference over
those specifications this afternoon will be the last. Are you sure
you discovered no flaw over which the old General or the big stupid
Governor can haggle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I discovered not a flaw,&rdquo; I answered her with a
great positiveness. &ldquo;Do you say that it is soon that those
representatives of my government come to make a last signing of the
papers about the excellent mules to be sent from the great State of
Harpeth to France who is at a war of death? I had not heard of the
nearness of the visit at the Capitol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know it&mdash;that is, Governor Faulkner
does, but has told only me. He sees things my way but of&mdash;of
course, he has to keep his councils from his Secretary of State for
the time being. And I&rsquo;m telling you all about it,
because&mdash;because it is for France we plot and because
I&mdash;this is the way to say it.&rdquo; And with those wicked
words, which involved the honor of the great Gouverneur Faulkner,
she pressed her body close to mine and her lips upon my mouth.</p>
<p>For that caress of that wicked woman I had not sufficient
endurance and I pushed her from me with roughness and sprang to my
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not true, Madam Whitworth, that&mdash;&rdquo; I was
exclaiming when I caught myself in the midst of my own betrayal,
just as I was about to be shown into a plot which it was of much
value to know. And as my words ceased I stood and trembled before
her wickedness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Mr. Robert Carruthers, I do not entirely
understand you,&rdquo; she said with a great and beautiful calmness
as she lighted a cigarette and looked at me trembling before her.
&ldquo;You are a very bold young cavalier but you have the
shrinking nature of&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;a
French&mdash;<em>girl</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke those words, which began in sarcasm but ended in a
queer uncertain tone of suspicion, as if she had blundered on a
reason to soothe her vanity for the recoil of my lips from hers, an
ugly gleam shot from under her lowered lashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the son of the house of Carruthers as well as of
Grez and Bye, beautiful Madam, and I cannot endure that you put
upon my very good Uncle, the General Carruthers, an unfriendliness
to France,&rdquo; I exclaimed with a quickness of my brain that I
had not before discovered. &ldquo;On points of honor I have that
sensitiveness that you say to be&mdash;be of a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my darling boy, I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you about
that absurd old feud of&mdash;&rdquo; And as she spoke the
beautiful Madam Patricia rose and came upon me with outstretched
arms for another abhorred embrace, which it was to my good fortune
to have interrupted. But I had a fear of that suspicion I had seen
flashed into her mind even though lulled by my fine assumption of
the attitude of a man of honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely and beautiful Madam,&rdquo; I made a beginning to
say, when&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mr. Carruthers is here, for I have an
appointment to call for him,&rdquo; an interruption came in the
voice of my Buzz in remonstrance with the black maid of Madam
Whitworth in the hall of her house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Buzz, dear,&rdquo; called that beautiful Madam
Whitworth as in one small instant she changed both her position
with arms on my shoulder and her countenance of anger and anxiety.
She was a very wise and beautiful and much experienced woman, was
that Madam Whitworth, but she had given to me, unlessoned as I was
in the art of politics, the fact that I most wanted: that the two
papers containing the specifications concerning the mules had been
mistranslated by her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put a shawl around you, Madam Pat, and come out here to
the street a minute to see what is going to happen to the Prince of
Carruthers,&rdquo; said my rescuer as he inserted his head into the
room for one little minute and beckoned us to follow him.</p>
<p>And what did I find out there upon that street?</p>
<h2><a id="ChXIII" name="ChXIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>
<h3>BROTHERS BY BLOODSHED</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I then experienced a surprise that gave to me a very great
pleasure and which made my heart to expand until it almost burst
the restraint of that towel of the bath under the bag of my brown
cheviot coat. Before the door of the house of the beautiful Madam
Whitworth stood the gray racing car of my Buzz, and before it stood
a slim car of a similar make, only it was of the darkest amethyst
that seemed to be almost a black, while behind it stood one of
equal if not superior elegance of shape which had the beautiful
blackness of jet. That was not all! Across the street stood also a
car of a golden brown and to the front of it one of the red of a
very dark cherry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; said my Buzz with a wave of his
hand. &ldquo;Pick one, with the compliments of the General. I think
the amethyst is a jewel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is not possible to me to accept a present of such
delight from my good Uncle, the General Robert. I must go to him
and say that I am not worthy!&rdquo; I exclaimed with a large
faltering in my voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; just jump into the one you like best and drive
on down to the Old Hickory Club and say it to him. Sorry that you
can&rsquo;t come along, Mrs. Pat, but that glad rag you&rsquo;ve
got on is too great a beauty with which to appear in public. Better
take it into the house before you catch a cold in this
breeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I must run in,&rdquo; answered Madam Whitworth with
a slight shivering in her gown of great thinness. &ldquo;They are
perfectly wonderful, boy, and I say choose the brown
darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Governor Bill picked the cherry from the catalogue for us
day before yesterday, but I think the amethyst has got it
beat,&rdquo; answered my Buzz as he started towards his own car.
&ldquo;Jump into your choice and lead me on down to hear you refuse
it to old Forty-Two Centimeter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then without further remark, I followed him down the steps and
got into that car which was the color of the heart of the cherry
and I raced that Mr. Bumble Bee through the city of Hayesville in a
manner which put to flight a large population thereof. I had not
had my hands on the wheel of a racing car for the many months since
my father in his had left the small Pierre and Nannette and me
weeping on the terrace of the Chateau de Grez when he went to the
battlefield of the Marne, and I drove with all of that accumulated
fury within me. And I could see that my Buzz enjoyed it as much as
did I, though in his face was a great fear as several very large
policemen waved their hands at us and then savagely transcribed the
numbers of his car in books from their pockets when we whirled on
with refusal to stop and listen to their remarks.</p>
<p>And this is what my Uncle, the General Robert, answered to me as
I told him of my unworthiness of his gift of the most beautiful
cherry car:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a just return for your consideration for me in
being born a boy, and I hope you&rsquo;ll break the necks of about
two dozen young females in this town before the week&rsquo;s out.
Begin on that baggage, Susan, right away.&rdquo; And as he spoke,
my Uncle, the General Robert, came down the steps of the great Club
of Old Hickory with the Gouverneur Faulkner and stood beside my
Cherry with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no better man than I, General, and I&rsquo;ve
been trying it all year,&rdquo; answered my Buzz with one of those
delectable grinnings upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my much loved Uncle Robert, it is impossible that
I accept your gift in gratitude that I am not a woman, because for
the good reason&mdash;&rdquo; and my honor was about to rise up in
arms and betray the daredevil and her schemes within me when that
good and most beloved Gouverneur Faulkner interrupted me by
stepping into the Cherry beside me with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, General; this is just what I need in all of my
business with Robert. We&rsquo;ll be back in time to dine with you
at seven here at the Club. Go out to the West End, Robert.&rdquo;
And with his hand on the spark he started the Cherry, and I was
forced to sweep away from my Buzz and my Uncle, the General Robert,
into the traffic and away from the Club of Old Hickory, which is
named for a very great general of America and is a club of much
fashion and some bad behavior, my Buzz has said to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t mean to kidnap you and the car,
youngster, but I&rsquo;ve had a pain under my left pocket all day,
and I have got to operate on it. A sudden impulse told me that it
would be easier if I took you with me to&mdash;to sort of stand
by,&rdquo; said my beautiful Gouverneur Faulkner in a grave tone of
voice as I whirled him out the broad avenue that led to the west
end of the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my Gouverneur Faulkner, is it that you are ill,
perhaps to die by a knife?&rdquo; I exclaimed and for a second I
let that wild Cherry run in a very dangerous manner almost upon
another large car in the act of turning into the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that, Robert,&rdquo; he answered me quickly and
he laid his hand on my arm beside him for an instant as if to give
a steadiness to me. &ldquo;I want you to take me out to the State
Prison. I want to talk face to face with a man who killed his own
brother, in cold blood, it is said. A pretty powerful influence is
at me day and night for a reprieve and I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
what to do about it. It is a difficult case. If I went in my
official capacity to see the man it might give his friends undue
hopes; and suddenly I felt that I could run away from the whole
bunch at this hour of the day and see the man himself without
anybody&rsquo;s knowing it save the superintendent of the prison
and myself. You don&rsquo;t count, because in this case you are
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always I would be yourself to you, my reverenced
Gouverneur Faulkner,&rdquo; I made reply to him as I raised my eyes
to his deep ones that smiled down into them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that is as good as it sounds, boy,&rdquo;
asked my Gouverneur Faulkner gently, as he looked down at me with
both a laugh and a sadness influencing the smile of his mouth.
&ldquo;Sometimes I badly need two of myself. They are at me from
waking to sleeping and I often feel cut into little bits and I
can&rsquo;t even say so. In fact, youngster, I&rsquo;m squealing to
you more than I&rsquo;ve let myself do since I became the chief
executive of this State of Harpeth. Now, turn off into this road
and go straight ahead. The prison is about a mile back there at the
foot of that hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;like those squeals,&rdquo; I answered to his
smile as I put my Cherry against the spring wind and raced down
that long road at a great speed that prevented any more
conversation at that moment. My pride bade me show to that
Gouverneur of Harpeth what good driving in a fine car I was able to
accomplish.</p>
<p>Therefore it was not many minutes before we stood within the
doors of that very grim and terrible home of the human beings who
have sinned with a great crime. I know that I am never to forget
that hour and am to carry forever the wound that it inflicted upon
my heart as I walked through the dimness and grayness and stillness
of that dark house.</p>
<p>At last, with many unlockings of heavy doors by the director of
that prison, we stood in a room that was as a cage in which to keep
the human animal that crouched down upon a hard bed in one of its
corners and leaned a head shaved bare of any hair upon a very thin
and white hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me, Superintendent, for a few minutes. The young
man will stay by the door to let you know when I want you,&rdquo;
said that Gouverneur Faulkner to the superintendent, who nodded and
left the room as I took a position over beside the heavy iron bars
that swung together after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My man,&rdquo; said the Gouverneur Faulkner in a voice
that was so gentle as that which a mother uses to a child in severe
illness, &ldquo;I want you to let me sit down on your cot beside
you and talk to you about your trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got nothing to say, parson. I done it and I want to swing
as quick as the law sends me,&rdquo; answered the poor human from
behind his hands without even raising his bowed head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a minister, and I&rsquo;ve come to talk to you
because some of your neighbors and friends think that there may be
a reason why you should not be hanged for the death of your
brother. It is my duty to help them keep you from the penalty of
the law, which you may not deserve even if you desire it. Can you
tell me your story as man to man, with the hope that it will help
you to a reprieve?&rdquo; And as he spoke I observed a tone of
command come into the voice of my Gouverneur Faulkner, that was as
clear and beautiful as the call of the bugle to men for a
battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I done what I had to and I&rsquo;m ready to die for it.
I&rsquo;ve got nothing to say,&rdquo; answered the man with still
more of the determination of misery in his voice. &ldquo;My
neighbors don&rsquo;t know nothing about it and I don&rsquo;t want
&rsquo;em to. Just let them keep quiet and let it all die when the
State swings me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there is some secret about the matter that you are
willing to die to keep, is there?&rdquo; asked the Gouverneur
Faulkner with a quickness of command in his voice. &ldquo;What had
your brother done to Mary Brown that you killed him for
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you, what&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo; snarled the
man as he sprang up from beside the Gouverneur and leaned, crouched
and panting, against the bars of the cage in which the three of us
were inclosed. &ldquo;Who are you anyway? My State has said I was
to swing for killing him and there&rsquo;s no more to question
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Governor of your State,&rdquo; answered that
Gouverneur Faulkner as he rose and stood tall and commanding before
the poor human being who was cowering as a dog that had felt the
lash of a whip. &ldquo;You are my son because you are a son of the
State of Harpeth, and as a representative of that State I am going
to exercise my guardianship and if possible prevent the State from
the crime of taking your life if you do not deserve
punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m condemned by the laws of the State. You
can&rsquo;t go back on that, Governor or no Governor,&rdquo; made
answer the man, with a panting of misery in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you know, there are certain unwritten laws which have
more influence in some cases as to the guilt of a murderer than any
on the statute books,&rdquo; said the Gouverneur Faulkner with a
very great slowness, so that the poor human dog might comprehend
him. &ldquo;If you killed your brother to save&mdash;save Mary
Brown from worse than death, then you have not the right to demand
execution from your State to shelter her from publicity when she is
no longer in danger of anything worse. Did you get to her in time
to save her or&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, good God, I did and I
had&mdash;damn you, now I&rsquo;ll have to kill you for getting
words out of me that all the lawyers have tried to make me say all
this time,&rdquo; and with the oath and a snarl the man made a
lunge at my Gouverneur Faulkner with something keen and shining
that he had drawn from the top of his coarse boot. But that poor
human being of the prison was not of enough quickness to do the
killing of his desire in the face of Roberta, Marquise of Grez and
Bye, who had twice with her foil pricked the red cloth heart of the
young Count de Couertoir, the best swordsman of France, in gay
combat in the great hall of the old Chateau de Grez. With my
walking cane of a young gentleman of American fashion, which I had
taken with me to call upon the beautiful Madam Whitworth before my
Cherry had befallen me as a gift, and which I had without thought
brought into that prison with me, I parried the blow of the knife
at my beloved Gouverneur Faulkner, but not in such a manner as to
prevent a glancing of that knife, which inflicted a scratch of
considerable depth upon my forearm under its sleeve of brown
cheviot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, boy!&rdquo; exclaimed that Gouverneur Faulkner as
he caught the knife from the floor where it had fallen from the
hand of the poor man who had sunk down on the cot, trembling and
panting. &ldquo;Two inches to the left and a little more force and
the knife would have stuck in your heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not better my heart than yours, my great Gouverneur
Faulkner? And behold it is the heart of neither and only a small
scratch upon my humble arm, which will not even prevent the driving
of that new Cherry car,&rdquo; I answered him as I put that arm
behind me and pressed it close in its sleeve of brown cheviot so
that there would be no drippings of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go to hurt the young gentleman nor you
either, Governor,&rdquo; said the man from the cot as he sobbed and
buried his head in his arms. &ldquo;I was always a good man and now
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say another word, Timms,&rdquo; interrupted
my Gouverneur Faulkner in a voice that was as gentle as that father
of State which he had said himself to be to Timms. &ldquo;Nobody
will know of this, for your sake. I was&mdash;was baiting you. I
know what I want to know now and you&rsquo;ll not hang on the
sixteenth. The State will try you again. Call the superintendent,
Robert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say nothing to hurt Mary, Governor. Jest let
me hang and I won&rsquo;t never care what&mdash;&rdquo; the poor
human began to plead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after Mary&mdash;and you too, Timms.
I&rsquo;ll see to it that&mdash;&rdquo; my Gouverneur Faulkner was
answering the trembling plea for his mercy when the superintendent
came in and unlocked the cage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him know of the&mdash;accident,
youngster,&rdquo; whispered the Gouverneur Faulkner to me, and in a
very few minutes we were out of that prison into the Cherry car,
and whirling with great rapidity down the country road with its
tall trees upon both sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Robert,&rdquo; commanded His Excellency as we came
under a large group of very old trees which made a thick shelter of
their green leaves as they leaned together over the stone wall that
bordered the side of the road. &ldquo;Now let me see just what did
happen to that arm which came between poor Timms&rsquo; sharpened
case knife and my life. We are out of sight of the prison now. It
would have all been up with Timms if that attack upon me had been
discovered. Your pluck will have saved Timms, if he&rsquo;s saved,
as well as your Governor. Here, turn towards me and let me see that
arm.&rdquo; And as he spoke, my Gouverneur Faulkner put his arm
across my shoulder and turned me towards him so that he could put
his right hand on the sleeve of that cheviot bag in which was a
long slash from the knife and which was now wet with my blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I very much fear my beloved brown cheviot, which I have
worn only a few times, is now dead; and how will I find another for
my need!&rdquo; I exclaimed with a great alarm when I saw that that
knife had thus devastated my good clothing of which I had not many
and for the procuring of which I was many thousand miles from my
good friend and tailor in New York. If I sought another suit in the
city of Hayesville might there not be dangers of discoveries in the
adjustment thereof? &ldquo;Is it not a vexation?&rdquo; I asked as
the Gouverneur Faulkner attempted to push back that murdered sleeve
from my forearm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the language of my friend Buzz, you are one sport,
Robert. Shell out of that coat immediately. I want to see just how
much of a scratch that is and I can&rsquo;t get the sleeve up high
enough,&rdquo; commanded my Gouverneur Faulkner. The tone of his
voice was the same he had used to me in commanding that I take his
mail to his nice lady stenographer, but his face was very white and
his hand that he laid upon the collar of my coat for assisting me
to lay it aside trembled with a great degree of violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my Gouverneur Faulkner, it is but a scratch
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of that coat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off with that coat, Robert!&rdquo; he commanded me, and
before I could make resistance, my coat was almost completely off
of me by his aid and I was obliged to let it slip into his hands.
He laid it on the back of the seat behind him, and with hands that
were as gentle as those of old Nannette when dealing with one of my
injuries of a great number in childhood, he rolled up the sleeve of
my nice white shirt with the brown strip of coloring in accord with
that beloved and regretted cheviot, and bared my forearm, which was
very strong and white but which also appeared to me to be
dangerously rounded for his gaze. I was glad that that arm was
covered with a nice gore which had come from the long slit but
which had now well-nigh ceased to run from me, so that he could not
observe that it was of such a feminine mould.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just a deep scratch that I can fix all right myself
in my own bathroom when we get back to the Mansion in time for
dinner with the General by seven-thirty, I hope,&rdquo; said my
beloved Gouverneur as he helped me again to assume the ruined
garment of cheviot. &ldquo;I was born in the mountains of the State
of Harpeth, boy, where when one man sheds his blood for the life of
another, that other is said to be under bond to his rescuer and
that means a tie closer than the ordinary one of brother by birth.
I acknowledge the bond to you for all time, little brother. Now
drive on quickly to the Mansion before we are in danger of being
late for dinner with the General. It will take me some few minutes
to get you out of that shirt and into your dinner coat. I&rsquo;ll
send for it and you can dress with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, my beloved Gouverneur Faulkner; I must go
immediately to home and there make myself presentable for a dinner
of some very wonderful pie that my Buzz demanded of that very
lovely Madam Taylor in my honor. That nice black lady, Kizzie, will
with joy attend on this scratch upon my arm, assisted by my good
Bonbon,&rdquo; I exclaimed with great alarm for fear that that very
strong mind of my Gouverneur would command me to make my toilet in
his company in the Mansion. &ldquo;Please do not command me that I
shall not so do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, youngster, go to your frolic with the rest of
the babes and sucklings, only remember that I always like to have
you with me, but&mdash;never command you when it is not your
pleasure,&rdquo; answered that Gouverneur Faulkner to me with
gentleness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is always my pleasure to be with you, my Gouverneur,
and I do like that you command me,&rdquo; I said to him in answer
to that gentleness that had something of a sad longing in
it&mdash;for that custard pie of Madam Taylor, I suppose, of which
he had probably heard famous mention, but which I would have
believed to have been a longing for Roberta, Marquise of Grez and
Bye, if I had heard it so spoken, with an English or Russian or
French accent, to me in a robe of tulle or sheer linen. &ldquo;And
may I not return immediately after that supper to that Club of Old
Hickory for conversation with you and my Uncle, the General
Robert?&rdquo; I asked with eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, by the time you have eaten that fatted pie at the
Taylors&rsquo; and danced at least a portion of it off of your
system I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;be burning the midnight oil going over
the papers in the case of Timms. I want to weigh all the testimony
carefully in the case given in Court about his own and his
brother&rsquo;s relations with the woman Mary Brown. As long as I
am the Governor of the State of Harpeth, no honest man is going to
swing for protecting a good woman from the outrages of a brute. And
yet Timms confessed the crime and denied the motive.
Cross-examining failed to get the statement from the woman that
would justify my reprieving or pardoning him. I cannot even seem to
dishonor the proceedings of the courts of the State and, boy,
I&rsquo;m just plain&mdash;up&mdash;against&mdash;it. Here we are
at my own side door. Good night, and make a lightning toilet if you
want to get to that pie on time. Good night, again!&rdquo; And with
those words, which explained his very deep trouble to me, my
Gouverneur Faulkner descended from the seat beside me in the Cherry
to the pavement beside his Mansion and bade me hurry from him.</p>
<h2><a id="ChXIV" name="ChXIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>
<h3>TO BEAR MEN AND TO SAVE THEM</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>In going I turned and looked back at him to see that he was
standing looking after me with a very great weariness in the manner
of the drooping of his shoulders and the sadness of his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roberta,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;a woman who so
reverences and regards a man as you do that Gouverneur Faulkner
will find a way to help him so that he shall not suffer as he does
in regard to not knowing with surety the reason of that Mr.
Timms&rsquo; making a murder upon his brother. What is it that you
shall do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to that question to myself I found an answer in only two
short hours while partaking of the very famous custard pie at the
table of that very lovely Madam Taylor.</p>
<p>All of those very gay and nice &ldquo;babes and sucklings&rdquo;
which the Gouverneur Faulkner had mentioned, were with me at the
table of Madam Taylor with very much laughter and merriment, also
much conversation. And in that conversation were very many jokes
upon my Buzz because he had been transported to the Capitol by my
Uncle, the General Robert, and given hard labor until almost the
time to arrive for that nice supper, which he was eating with much
hunger. On account of lateness he had not been able to come to the
house of lovely Sue to escort her with him to the home of Madam
Taylor. That Sue with pretended haughtiness was looking very high
above the head of the humble Buzz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not my fault that Timms up and biffed
his brother into eternity all for buzzing pretty Mary Brown, and I
don&rsquo;t see why I had to be rung in to sort out of a million
sheets of trial evidence the lies he told about it, for poor old
Governor Bill to moil over all night. I say when a man wants to be
hung as badly as that, he ought to get what he&rsquo;s crying for,
and not butt in on a perfectly innocent man&rsquo;s afternoon fox
trot,&rdquo; was that Mr. Buzz Clendenning&rsquo;s wailing to all
of the company. &ldquo;Look the other way, Sue, so as not to turn
this muffin cold until I get it buttered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told my washwoman, who is Mary&rsquo;s sister, that
Mary ought to be made to tell just what did happen and then it
could all be arranged so that the poor man could be saved to her. I
think it is hard on Mary to lose both lovers,&rdquo; said that very
intelligent Mildred Summers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They live just over beyond our back gate. Suppose we all
go and put it up to the attractive Mary to speak up and keep Buzz
from the danger of overwork a second time,&rdquo; said that nice
young Mr. Taylor with what I considered a great intelligence but
which caused much laughter.</p>
<p>And at that suggestion which caused the much merriment, that
daredevil within Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, again arose and
commanded me to attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, Robert Carruthers, and obtain that paper of statement
from that Mary, so that your chief, that good Gouverneur Faulkner,
does not work in the night which is for rest, and that your beloved
Buzz may not again have to work in his afternoon which is for
dancing. Go and find that Mary as soon as this dinner is at an
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what was it possible for me to do but to answer the command
of the daredevil person within me? All of which I did. I made
excuse of myself on account of a lie which involved my attendance
on my Uncle, the General Robert, and departed after I had had but
one nice slide with the lovely Sue, but had obtained a promise of
one from Mademoiselle Belle if I found it possible to return by the
hour of ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>After many inquiries at the back of the house of Madam Taylor in
small streets I was at last led to the home of the Mary Brown. All
was dark within the very small house, but upon the steps, in the
light from the moon and also a street arc, sat the person that a
man, of whom I had asked guidance, said to be the woman whom I
sought. She rested her head in her hands as had done that poor
human in the cage in that State Prison and from her I heard the
sounds of slow weeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that I shall say to her?&rdquo; I asked of
myself. And then suddenly something answered from within me from
the same place that had arisen that knowledge to spring in between
my Gouverneur Faulkner and the bright knife I had not even seen.
That place is located in the heart of Roberta, Marquise of Grez and
Bye, and not in that daredevil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Brown,&rdquo; I said to her with all of the
gentleness in my voice that was commanded by my sympathy for her,
&ldquo;if a person were going to kill with a rope the man I loved I
would lay down my own life that he should live. If you write one
little paper to say that he murdered in defense of you, the good
Gouverneur Faulkner will save him to you. Give to me that
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; she moaned as she shook her head and
cried into her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Mary: Here is the pencil and the paper to write the
words of life for Timms to that Gouverneur Faulkner,&rdquo; I said
as I seated myself beside her and extracted my notebook and pencil
from the pocket of my overcoat where I had placed them on leaving
my room as is always best, I deemed, for a secretary. &ldquo;There
are just two things that are the duty of women, Mary: to bear men
and to save them. Save yours now, Mary. Much will happen, it may
be; but that Timms is a good man and must live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dassent. He told me not to, Timms did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a knife was aimed at Timms&rsquo; heart, would you not
throw yourself between him and its cut, Mary, even though commanded
by him not to so save him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The knife is aimed and here&rsquo;s the paper by which
you can throw your person on that knife. Is it of such moment that
it cut into your own heart, that you stand and let it give death to
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give up! I give up, Mister! I can&rsquo;t let nobody
murder him. Nobody ever put it that way to me. Give me that paper
and let me git to him fer jest one minute to-morrow,&rdquo; she
made answer to me as she seized the paper and pencil and began to
write with the paper spread beside her upon the step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will myself send you in my car with good black Kizzie
to see Timms to-morrow, Mary,&rdquo; I promised her while she
wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got ter get my arms around his neck once more
&rsquo;fore he kills me fer telling,&rdquo; she answered as she
signed her name to the paper and handed it to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Place those arms in that position, Mary, before telling
him of your action and all will be well,&rdquo; I advised of her
with much wisdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will that do, Mister?&rdquo; she asked with anxiety as I
began to fold the paper.</p>
<p>On that paper she had written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hen Timms had locked me in the room and was forcing me when
Gabe broke in and got me away from him. He had to bust his head
with a flatiron to make him let go of me. I am a good woman.</p>
<p class="indent4">Mary Brown"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, good Mary, this will shield Timms from that knife, I
feel a certainty, and I will send for you and see that you go to an
interview with him at ten o&rsquo;clock of the to-morrow morning.
And now good night, with great respect to you for a brave
woman,&rdquo; I said as I rose to my feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, Mister, that have spoke to my heart like
they ain&rsquo;t nobody spoke to its suffering yet, though you
ain&rsquo;t said many words and them is curious like?&rdquo; she
asked of me as I prepared to take a hurried departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the secretary of the Gouverneur Faulkner, Mary,
and&mdash;and&mdash;I know&mdash;how women&mdash;love&mdash;men.
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet a many of &rsquo;em have loved you, God bless your
sweet eyes. Good night, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with those kind words from the poor female, who was
beginning again to sob but with another motive in her weeping, I
took my departure down the street&mdash;or up&mdash;I did not know
in just which direction. I had the intention of returning to the
house of Madam Taylor to obtain the Cherry, which I had left
standing before her door, and in it convey the message to my
Gouverneur Faulkner that should bring relief to his anxiety, but I
soon found that I had lost myself upon streets that I had never
seen before.</p>
<p>What was it that I should do? My heart suffered that my
Gouverneur Faulkner should not know the relief of that paper I had
in the pocket of my dinner coat, but I could not find myself and I
did not know exactly what questions I should ask. Then I bethought
me of that telephone, which in America is so much used, but not in
France. I entered into a store for medicines upon the corner of one
of the streets in my wandering, looked diligently in a book to find
the number for the Mansion of the Gouverneur, and after many
tellings of my desire, at last my Gouverneur Faulkner made an
answer in my ear that was as beautiful in voice as the words he
spoke to me in his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Robert Carruthers who speaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, youngster. How did the fatted pie
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a very nice pie, Your Excellency, and I have a
paper from that Mary Brown concerning the murder of the brother of
good Timms for cruelty to Mary. I wish to give it to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then bring it here to me at once and tell me how you got
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll come to you. Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know. I am lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, boy, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in a store of medicine that is many streets from
that house of good Mary Brown, and also from the house of Madam
Taylor. I have the intention of calling on the telephone my
faithful Bonbon and asking that he come and find me and deliver me
to the home of Madam Taylor and from thence transport this paper to
you that you go to sleep for a much needed rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You helpless young idiot, call a taxi and come right here
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am promised to a dance with Mademoiselle Belle by the
hour of ten, of which it lacks now only a quarter. Cannot I go in
that taxicab, which it is of much intelligence of you to suggest to
me, and send by that taxicab to you the paper from Mary Brown while
I stay to dance that dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;no, I can&rsquo;t say it over
the telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, my Gouverneur Faulkner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it in the morning to you in person.
I&rsquo;ll just hold up the wheels of state until that dance is
over. Go ahead, youngster; call the taxi and get back to Belle.
I&rsquo;ll have Jenkins waiting at the Taylor&rsquo;s to get the
paper and you can&mdash;can tell me all about it in the morning.
Will nine o&rsquo;clock be too early to call you from&mdash;your
rosy dreams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not have coffee until nine o&rsquo;clock, my
Gouverneur Faulkner, and I do not make a very hurried toilet, but I
will come to you at the Capitol at that nine o&rsquo;clock if you
so command&mdash;very gladly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we&rsquo;ll all of us just&mdash;just cool our
heels until you get your coffee and toilet. Don&rsquo;t hurry, I
beg of you! Good night, and beat it to Belle, as Buzz would say.
Good night, you&mdash;you&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll say it all in the
morning if it takes a half day. Good night again.&rdquo; And with
that parting salutation my Gouverneur Faulkner&rsquo;s voice died
from the telephone with what I thought had the sound of a very nice
laugh.</p>
<p>That Mademoiselle Belle Keith is a dancer of the greatest
beauty, and also is the homely Mildred Summers. The two hours until
midnight at the home of my lovely Madam Taylor seemed as one short
half of an hour to me. I also had the pleasure of conducting the
nice Belle home in the Cherry so that I could make a fine display
to her of my skill with a motor. In France it would be of a great
scandal to allow a beautiful <em>jeune fille</em>, as is that
Belle, and a nice gentleman, such as I declare Mr. Robert
Carruthers to be, to go out into the midnight alone and unattended;
but is it that in America the gentlemen are of a greater virtue
than in France, or is it that the ladies have that great virtue? I
do not know, but I declare it to be of much interest to remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find old Forty-Two Centimeter firing off
overtime, L&rsquo;Aiglon, because when the Whitworth gang got
caught up on those specifications they side-stepped with another
proposition and he&rsquo;s scouting for holes in it. Better climb
the grapevine into bed and side-step him,&rdquo; advised Buzz to me
while we waited beside our cars for the beautiful Belle and
beautiful Sue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much gratitude for your advice, and good night,&rdquo; I
called to him as we separated the Cherry and the Gray and went in
diverse directions.</p>
<p>I understood that &ldquo;climb the grapevine into bed&rdquo; to
mean entering my home and that of my Uncle, the General Robert,
with much stealth and that thing I did, dropping into a deep sleep
in the moment of inserting myself between the sheets of that
bed.</p>
<p>And when I awakened, because of that much dancing, behold, it
was ten of the clock and eleven thereto before I arrived in a very
great hurry with much pinkness of cheeks in the office of the
Gouverneur Faulkner at the Capitol of the State of Harpeth.</p>
<p>And in that office I also discovered my Uncle, the General
Robert, performing the action of the forty-two centimeter gun with
words about my extreme lateness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young fox trotter, you, I&rsquo;d break every bone in
your body if I wasn&rsquo;t so damned proud of you,&rdquo; he
exploded directly in front of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General, if you&rsquo;ll let me take Robert into his
office for five minutes alone I&rsquo;ll help you take the hide off
of him later,&rdquo; said that Gouverneur Faulkner as he beamed the
great kindness to me. &ldquo;Just stay here and get that Timms
pardon crowd ready to hear the news of Mary&rsquo;s confession and
I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it when I&rsquo;ve settled with
Robert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir, very well,&rdquo; answered my Uncle, the
General Robert, with a further explosion of words.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll also expect you to give him commands about this
dance the young females in this town are leading him.&rdquo; With
which my Uncle, the General Robert, himself went into the anteroom
and left me alone with the beloved Gouverneur Faulkner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Robert,&rdquo; he said to me with a laugh
as he came and stood close beside me. That Roberta, Marquise of
Grez and Bye, will blush within me, when that beloved Gouverneur
comes very close beside her, in a way that is an embarrassment to
Robert Carruthers, his secretary. &ldquo;And now tell me what you
said to that stupid Mary Brown that made her see the light,&rdquo;
he asked me with his fine eyes looking into mine with a great
interest and something of admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked of her if she would not throw herself before that
beloved good Timms if a knife was aimed at his heart; and she
perceived from that question that she must give to me the paper. A
heart that has felt a great tragedy draw near a beloved one can
speak without words to another who sees also a beloved in danger.
Is it that you slept in ease, my Gouverneur Faulkner, after you had
received that paper? It grieved me that you should sit at work
while I was at dancing,&rdquo; I answered to him as I drew nearer
and laid my hand with timidity upon the sleeve of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, boy, do they grow many like you in France?&rdquo;
was the answer that the great Gouverneur Faulkner made to me as he
looked down into the adoration of my eyes raised to his, with a
question that was of deep bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;France has grown many young and fine men who&mdash;who
die, my Gouverneur Faulkner for her in the trenches, where I must
soon go,&rdquo; I answered him with my head drawn to its entire
height in the likeness of the old Marquis of Grez and Flanders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you go into the trenches of France, youngster, the
State of Harpeth will have a Governor on leave in the same
trench,&rdquo; answered me that Gouverneur Faulkner with a very
gentle hand laid on the sleeve of my coat above the bandages of my
wound, and a glow of the star in his eyes. &ldquo;Brothers by
bloodshed, Marquis of Grez and Bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, how will you even gain
the refuge of your petticoats and get away from these lies of
dishonor if you are to be so pursued by&mdash;&rdquo; I was asking
of myself when my Uncle, the General Robert, opened the door and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better see this pardon delegation now, Governor. That
other matter is going to go to hell as fast as it can if we
don&rsquo;t scotch it. Robert, get those letters on your desk into
United States as quickly as possible. That French deluge is upon
us. Come back as soon as you can.&rdquo; With which I was dismissed
into my own small anteroom.</p>
<p>And what did I find in those letters?</p>
<h2><a id="ChXV" name="ChXV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>
<h3>&ldquo;BEHOLD, I AM A SPY!&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>As I sat and held in my hand those papers in which were two long
messages, the one written in a very poor English and the other in a
very elegant French, the woman Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye,
trembled with fear of a discovery of her woman&rsquo;s estate while
that daredevil Robert Carruthers raged within and also turned with
a deadly hatred and distrust of the greatest gentleman that <em>le
bon Dieu</em> had ever given to him to know. It was as I say, and
for this reason: In the letters were announcements of the arrival
of the Lieutenant, Count Edouard de Bourdon, on that Tuesday which
the Madam Whitworth had mentioned. They were written with great
ceremony to my Uncle, the General Robert Carruthers, as Secretary
of the State of Harpeth, to give to him that information to be
conveyed to His Excellency, the Gouverneur Faulkner, in due form
though he already had that information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They make into a fool my revered Uncle, the General
Robert Carruthers, who would keep his State and the Gouverneur of
that State from dishonor!&rdquo; I exclaimed to myself in my rage.
&ldquo;And this woman thinks to play with the life of French
soldiers as she has with that same Gouverneur Faulkner, does she?
No, there is Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, who is a soldier of
her Republique by appointment from the great Capitaine, the Count
de Lasselles, to both watch and further the interests of France,
whom she must meet in combat first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as I said these words to myself I made a rapid writing of
both papers and with them asked admittance to the room of that
false Gouverneur Faulkner, who had just dismissed the good men who
had come to thank him for his mercy shown to that poor creature
Timms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk right in, sir,&rdquo; said old Cato to me as he gave
a low bow of very great courtesy. Then he looked with eyes of great
keenness into my stormy face. &ldquo;Make a cross on the floor with
that hoodoo in your shoe, little mas&rsquo;, ef you git in danger
or need of luck,&rdquo; he whispered to me, coming very close. And
as he directed I so performed at the very entrance of the audience
chamber of the great Gouverneur of the State of Harpeth. Then, with
a fine relief on his face, good Cato flung open the door and
announced me with great ceremony.</p>
<p>In that room I found my Uncle, the General Robert, and the
Gouverneur Faulkner in deep consultation and they both turned
towards me with anxiety in their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you make of the letters, boy?&rdquo; asked my
Uncle, the General Robert, with keen anxiety. The great Gouverneur
was silent and for the first time since I had looked into his face
my eyes did not glance in his direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both announce the arrival on Tuesday of the
Lieutenant, the Count de Bourdon, to sign the contracts concerning
the mules to be sold by the State of Harpeth to the Republique of
France, sir,&rdquo; I answered in a cold and formal voice and then
stood at an attention for any more questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil they do!&rdquo; exclaimed my Uncle, the General
Robert, while still the Gouverneur Faulkner was silent. &ldquo;Do
they give no excuse for being nearly ten days ahead of time,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, honored Uncle,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Madam
Whitworth said to me that the Gouverneur Faulkner had set that date
for the arrival of the Commission, and had so informed her; and I
think that to be the reason for absence of such excuses.&rdquo; And
as I made that answer, which was one of great impertinence from a
secretary to a chief who was a great gouverneur, I looked with cold
calmness into the dark star eyes under their black lashes, which
were darting lightnings of anger at my words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo; exclaimed my Uncle, the General Robert
Carruthers, and he turned white with a trembling as he faced the
lightning in those eyes of the stars. But it was not to his
Secretary of State that the great Gouverneur Faulkner made his
denial but to his humble secretary, Robert Carruthers, who looked
without fear into the very depths of those lightnings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first time I have heard of a change of date
for the arrival of the commission, Robert,&rdquo; he said in a calm
voice as for a second his eyes held mine, a second which was
sufficient for a truth to pass from his heart and still the storm
in mine. I did not understand all that his eyes said of a great
hurt but I knew that what he spoke was true and would always
be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what were you doing gossiping with that lying hussy,
sir?&rdquo; demanded my Uncle, the General Robert, with instant
belief in the word of that Gouverneur Faulkner, turning his anger
upon me, who stood and took it with such a joy in my heart from the
truth that had come into it from those eyes of the night stars,
that I did not even feel its violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Vive la France</em> and the State of Harpeth! Behold,
I am a spy!&rdquo; I answered him as I drew myself to my greatest
height and gave the salute which his old soldiers give to him at
that raising of the banner of the Cause that he had lost in his
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young daredevil, you, I&rsquo;m a great mind to break
every bone in your body, as I have said before,&rdquo; he said to
me, but I could see a smile of pride making a lightning of the
gloom in his countenance over the trouble of his affairs of state.
&ldquo;You keep away from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; was the interruption made by my great
beloved Gouverneur Faulkner, &ldquo;upon you will fall the task of
making the plans for the entertainment of this countryman of yours.
The General and I will be too busy
getting-ready-to-meet-them-on-their-own-grounds to give any time to
that. Remember, they will have to be shown the best grazing land in
the valley, in motor cars. When they are done sizing us up,
we&rsquo;ll be ready for them. The Count and his secretaries will,
of course, be entertained at the Mansion and you can make
arrangements at the hotel for the rest of the suite. Also will you
please instruct my servants, from Cato down, how to make them
comfortable and, Robert, will you confer with Mrs. Whitworth, who,
as the wife of the Treasurer of the State of Harpeth while neither
the General nor I have wives, must be considered as the official
social representative of the State, as to what form the official
entertainments must take?&rdquo; And as he asked that question of
me my Gouverneur Faulkner did not so much as glance at my Uncle,
the General Robert, who gave an exclamation of contempt in his
throat as he began a reading of the two papers which I had handed
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also I suppose this means I must give up all hope of
services from that fly-up-the-creek, Clendenning,&rdquo; he
grumbled as he read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do as you bid me, my Gouverneur Faulkner, in all
things, and I will be much helped by both my excellent Buzz and the
beautiful Madam Whitworth,&rdquo; I made answer to the question and
command given to me by the Gouverneur Faulkner, and as I mentioned
the name of that lady I lowered my eyes to the floor and waited for
my dismissal. I did not want to look into his eyes, for I did not
know even then if I might not find that Madam Whitworth there. I
only knew that whatever she did or was to him, his honor was
inviolable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, get to it all,&rdquo; commanded my Uncle, the
General Robert. &ldquo;Get vouchers for what you spend and pay with
State Department checks. Don&rsquo;t blow in a fortune, you young
spendthrift, you, but also remember that the State of Harpeth is
one of the richest in America and knows how to show France real
hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That State of Harpeth has shown that hospitality to one
humble youth of France, my Uncle Robert, who has a great
gratitude,&rdquo; I made answer to him as I laid my cheek upon the
sleeve of his coat, which was of a cut in the best style for
gentlemen of his age but always of that Confederate gray, likewise
affected by good Cato. Try as hard as Robert Carruthers will, he
cannot force that Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, at all times
to refrain from a caress to the Uncle whom she so greatly
loves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear out, sir! Depart!&rdquo; was the response I got to
that caress; but always that wicked Roberta, Marquise of Grez and
Bye, finds in the face of her relative something that assures her
that she can so venture at a later time.</p>
<p>And as I turned away from that coldness on the part of my august
relative I found a glow of warmth for my reviving in the eyes of my
beautiful Gouverneur Faulkner, who held out his hand to me as I
started to the door for that departure commanded me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood brothers never doubt each other, Robert,&rdquo; he
said to me as with one hand he grasped my right hand and laid the
other on my above my bandage, over the wound Timms had given to me,
which was now almost entirely healed.</p>
<p>With the quickness of lightning I laid my cheek against the
sleeve of his coat, in exactly the caress I had given to my Uncle,
the General Robert, and then did depart with an equal rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat him, Bill?&rdquo; I heard my Uncle, the
General Robert, demand as I closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; was the answer I thought was
returned.</p>
<p>And from that audience chamber I went quickly and alone in my
good Cherry to Twin Oaks, was admitted by Bonbon, whom I instructed
not in any way to allow that I be interrupted, ascended to my own
apartment and seated myself in a large chair before the glowing
ashes of a small fire of fragrant chip twigs, which kind Madam
Kizzie had had lighted, against what she called a &ldquo;May
chill,&rdquo; during my toilet of the morning. Above me from the
mantelshelf, that Grandmamma Carruthers looked down with her great
and noble smile, while the flame in her eyes seemed to answer that
in my soul as I communed with myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that you will now do, Roberta, Marquise of
Grez and Bye?&rdquo; I asked of myself with a slight shaking of my
knees in their cheviot trousers. &ldquo;It is hardly possible that
you will escape from revealing your woman&rsquo;s estate to this
Frenchman of your own class. Here all mistakes of a man&rsquo;s
estate are forgiven you and laid to the fact of your being an
alien, but that Lieutenant, Count de Bourdon, will ask questions of
you and perhaps has a knowledge of your relatives and
friends&mdash;indeed, must have. Also, already that wicked Madam
Whitworth entertains suspicions of you. What is it that you will
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after I had asked myself for a second time that question I
sat and looked into the eyes of that Grandmamma Carruthers for many
long moments and had an argument with myself; then I answered to
her as I rose to my feet so that my eyes came more nearly on a
level with hers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Madam Ancestress, born of her whom not an Indian or a
fierce bear could frighten away from her duty of protection to
those of her affections, I will not flee. I will stay here by the
side of my Uncle, the General Robert, and my great chief, that
Gouverneur Faulkner, to fight for their honor and to protect France
from robbery. Then, if I be discovered and can do no more for them,
I will go from their presence quickly in the night and be lost in
the trenches of France before I am detained. And if it be that I am
not discovered before all is made well concerning those mules for
transportation of food to the soldiers of France, then I will still
go away to the battlefields of France before it is discovered by
all who have given affection to Robert Carruthers, that he is
a&mdash;lie. I will leave love for me and for France in all of
these kind hearts, which will comfort me when I fight for the
Republique, or live for her during long years. I grieve
exceedingly; but I go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after that long conference with myself I called upon the
telephone my Buzz and asked of him that he meet me at the Club of
Old Hickory, of which, after the required time of waiting, I was
soon to be an enrolled member.</p>
<p>And when I told to my Mr. Bumble Bee the fact that in the space
of barely three days the great gentleman of France would be in
Hayesville for the purpose of a visit and the signing of the
contracts concerning our much discussed friend, the mule, he gave a
very long and loud whistle and placed his elbows upon the smoking
table between us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this does call for hustle,&rdquo; he said as he
knocked from his cigarette the ashes. &ldquo;What are your plans,
L&rsquo;Aiglon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know what it is best to plan, my Buzz,&rdquo; I
answered in perplexity. &ldquo;Of course, there must be the
official reception by His Excellency, the Gouverneur Faulkner, upon
the evening of their arrival, but more I cannot think. Also, I am
commanded by His Excellency to consult the beautiful Madam
Whitworth as the only official wife of the State, on account of the
title of Treasurer of her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Pat will be satisfied to shine at the elbow of
Governor Bill at the reception and we can trust her to arrange
little odd cosy hours for herself and any of the bunch who pleases
her. It&rsquo;s the man end of it we want to handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is that man end you speak of I wish you to
perform for me, my Buzz,&rdquo; I assented eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what let&rsquo;s do,&rdquo; exclaimed
that Buzz with a very great light of enthusiasm coming into his
countenance. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t try to imitate London,
Paris or New York in blowing &rsquo;em off; let&rsquo;s give them a
taste of the genuine rural thing. Let&rsquo;s take the bunch down
to the Brice stock farm, Glencove, give &rsquo;em a barbecue done
by old Cato and let &rsquo;em see the horses run. Gee, they have
got a string of youngsters there! It will take two and a half days,
for it&rsquo;s fifty miles down over a mighty poor road, but
it&rsquo;s worth it when you get there. The Brice farm is the heart
of the Harpeth Valley. We took that English Lordkin, who came to
visit Governor Bill last year, down to see old Brice, and it took
us ten days to get him to break away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we will do, my fine Mr. Bumble Bee,&rdquo; I
answered with gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s the thing,&rdquo; said my Buzz with
conviction. &ldquo;We pass right through the grazing land of the
State and we can show them the mule in the making&mdash;the right
kind of mule. We&rsquo;d have to do that anyway, for that is what
they are here for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I feel a certainty that if I should continue to be an American
man for all of the days I may live, to that three score and ten
age, I would never be able to gain in any way even a small portion
of what my fine Mr. Buzz Clendenning calls &ldquo;hustle.&rdquo; I
went at his side for the three days which intervened between the
news of the arrival of that Lieutenant, Count de Bourdon, and that
actual arrival, in what seemed to me to be the pace of a very fleet
horse or even as the flight of a bird. And as fast as we went from
the arrangement of one detail of entertainment to another, the
beautiful Madam Whitworth went with us, with her eyes of the flower
blue very bright with a great excitement. I was glad that in all
matters it was necessary that my fine Buzz also consult with her
and thus I was not exposed to any of her wickedness alone.</p>
<p>And in my own heart was also a great excitement, for it seemed
to me that I was fighting a great battle for France all alone. All
day I could see that that Mr. Jefferson Whitworth and the other men
of wealth who with him were seeking to be robbers to my Country,
were first in consultation with themselves and then with my Uncle,
the General Robert, and also the Gouverneur Faulkner. Would their
powerful wickedness prevail and be able to force a signing of that
paper on the Gouverneur? Was that in their power, I asked of
myself, and in my ignorance I did not know an answer and had no
person to demand one from. There was no ease of heart to me, when
the days went by and I was so at work with my Buzz that I had no
time for words from my Gouverneur Faulkner or glance from those
eyes of the dawn star. I could only murmur to myself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Vive la France</em> and Harpeth America!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a id="ChXVI" name="ChXVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>
<h3>&ldquo;IMMEDIATELY I COME TO YOU!&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>And so the time passed until the morning upon which the same
railroad train which had brought young Robert Carruthers down into
the valley home of his forefathers, arrived with yet another son of
France and his secretaries and servants. All were in attendance at
the station of arrival, from the Secretary of State, the General
Carruthers, who in his large car was to take the Count de Bourdon
to the Gouverneur&rsquo;s Mansion for immediate introduction, down
to good Cato in a very new gray coat and a quite shiny black
hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand right alongside, Robert,&rdquo; commanded my Uncle,
the General Robert, as he arranged with impatience a large white
rose I had placed upon the lapel of his very elegant gray coat.
&ldquo;I never did like heathens. They make my flesh crawl. Be sure
and repeat slowly all he says, damn him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will speak to you in English very like unto that I
use, I feel sure, my Uncle Robert,&rdquo; I said with a great
soothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not, sir, he will not!&rdquo; answered my Uncle,
the General Robert, with a great impatience. &ldquo;Half the blood
in your veins is the good red blood I gave you, sir, and never
forget that. Look what a man it has made of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Uncle Robert,&rdquo; I answered with a great
sadness but also some amusement. In my heart I prayed that always
when I had left him he would think that blood to be the good red
blood of a man of honor and not of a woman of lies. It might be
that some day he would be proud that still another man of his house
had died in battle for France and&mdash;never know.</p>
<p>It was while my eyes were covered with a mist of tears that I
heard the great railway train approaching, which was perhaps to
bring me my dishonor, and I drew those tears back into my heart and
stepped forward to the steps of the car from which I could see a
very slight and short but very distinguished looking Frenchman
about to descend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank the good God I have never before encountered
him,&rdquo; I said in my heart as I stood in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant, the Count de Bourdon, I make you welcome to
the State of Harpeth, in the name of my Uncle, the Secretary of
that State,&rdquo; I said to him in the language of his own country
as I clapped together my heels and gave to him the bow from the
waist of a French gentleman who is not a soldier. &ldquo;Will you
permit that I lead you to that Uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks, Monsieur, is it Carruthers I name you after
your distinguished relative?&rdquo; he made answer to me as he
returned my bow with first one of its kind and then a military
salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert Carruthers, sir, and at your service,&rdquo; I
made answer to him with a great formality. And as I spoke I saw
that he gave to me a glance of great curiosity and would have asked
a question but at that moment my Uncle, the General Robert, stood
beside us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I present to you the General Carruthers, Secretary of the
State of Harpeth, Monsieur the Lieutenant, the Count de Bourdon of
the forty-fourth Chasseurs of the Republique of France.&rdquo; I
said with again a great ceremony and a very deep bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad to welcome you to Old Harpeth,
Count. How did you make the trip down? said my Uncle, the General
Robert, as he held out his large and beautiful old hand and gave to
the Count Edouard de Bourdon such a clasp that must have been to
him most painful. And as I beheld that very tall grand old soldier
of that Lost Cause look down upon that very polished and small
representative of the French army, that American eagle began a
flapping of his wings against the strings of my heart where I had
not before discovered him to reside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is not as my Capitaine, the Count de
Lasselles,&rdquo; I said in reproof to that eagle, which made a
quiet in my heart so that I could listen to the words returned by
the man of France to the man of America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Monsieur the Secretary of Harpeth; my
journey was of great pleasure and comfort,&rdquo; were the words
which he returned in very nice English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go right up and see Governor Faulkner at
the Capitol before lunch, Count, if that suits you,&rdquo; my
Uncle, the General Robert, said with a very evident relief at those
words of English coming from that French mouth. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
my car over this way and this is Mr. Clendenning, who&rsquo;ll look
after the rest of the gentlemen in your party and bring them on up
to the Capitol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the Lieutenant, Count de Bourdon,
with another bow and then a quick recovery as he saw that he must
take the hand of Buzz, held out to him in great cordiality. These
handshakes of America are very confusing to those of Europe.</p>
<p>I saw a great laughter almost to explosion in the eyes of my
Buzz at the very little man who had such a great manner, and I made
a hurrying of him and my Uncle, the General Robert, to the large
car standing beside the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will precede you in my Cherry,&rdquo; I said as I saw
both the gentlemen seated together upon the back seat of the large
black machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t; you take your seat right in here with
us, to be on hand if any bridge of this international conversation
breaks down under the Count and me,&rdquo; answered my Uncle, the
General Robert, with stern command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that the young Monsieur Carruthers had an education
in France?&rdquo; asked the Lieutenant, the Count de Bourdon.
&ldquo;He has the air of French&mdash;shall I say, youth?&rdquo;
And as he spoke again I saw a gleam of deeply aroused interest in
his eyes which made my knees to tremble in their tweed
trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Born there; son of my brother, who died at the
Marne,&rdquo; made answer to the question my Uncle, the General
Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now that I make a remembrance. That Capitaine
Carruthers was the husband to the very beautiful Marquise de Grez
and Bye. In her youth I was her friend. I did not
know&mdash;&rdquo; but as the Lieutenant, the Count de Bourdon, was
making this discovery which sent a thrill of fear into the toes of
my very shoes, the car stopped at the main entrance of the Capitol
and halfway down the long flight of steps stood His Excellency, the
great Gouverneur Faulkner of the State of Harpeth, waiting to
receive the guest who came on a mission to him from a great land
across the waters. Until I die and even into a space beyond that, I
shall take that picture of magnificence which was made by my
beloved Gouverneur Faulkner as he stood in the May sunlight with
his bronze hair in a gleaming. I thought him to be a great statue
of Succor as he held out both of his strong hands to the smaller
man who had come from a stricken land for his help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Le bon Dieu</em> keep of his heart a friend of
France,&rdquo; I prayed as I watched those hands clasp as my Uncle,
the General Robert, made the introduction.</p>
<p>And all the long hours of that long day were as dreams of
sadness and fear to me as I went about the many duties of
entertainment laid upon me. At luncheon at that Club of Old Hickory
I sat opposite the small Frenchman who sat on the right hand of my
Gouverneur Faulkner, and opposite to me sat my Uncle, the General
Robert. No business was in discussion at that time but I could see
those eyes of French shrewdness make a darting from one face to
another and ever they came back to me with a great puzzle which
gave to me terrible fear.</p>
<p>To all the plans for his entertainment he gave an assent of
delight and for that two days&rsquo; journey down into the grazing
lands of the Harpeth Valley he had a great eagerness until told
that it was to be undertaken upon the morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not that we will be occupied on the morning of
to-morrow with the signing of those papers of importance, Your
Excellency?&rdquo; he asked with a grave annoyance which was under
a fine control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Secretary of State, General Carruthers, and I think
it will be best that you see the grazing lands of Harpeth and some
of the mules being put into condition before the signing of the
contracts,&rdquo; was what was &ldquo;handed out to him,&rdquo; as
my Buzz would have expressed it, by my Gouverneur Faulkner with a
great courtesy and kindliness as he helped himself to some
excellent chicken prepared in a fry. I could see a great start of
alarm come into the eyes of that small Lieutenant, the Count de
Bourdon, at those calm words, but he gave not a sign of it. In my
heart was a great hope that something had been discovered for the
protection of my soldiers of France, and I also took to myself a
portion of that excellent chicken and did make the attempt to
consume it as I beheld all of those great gentlemen performing. I
believe that under excitement men possess a much greater calmness
of appetite than do women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Gouverneur, it is not necessary that I behold
those lands and those mules; the signature of the great Gouverneur
of the State of Harpeth will make a mule to grow from a desert, in
the eyes of the French Government,&rdquo; he said with a smile of
great charm spreading over his very small countenance.</p>
<p>But just at this moment, when a reply would have been of an
awkwardness to make, the music, which is made by a most delightful
band of black men for all eating in that Club of Old Hickory, began
to play the great Marseillaise, and with one motion all of the
gentlemen in that dining room rose to their feet in respect to the
distinguished guest of that Old Hickory Club. Also many friendly
glances were cast upon me, which I returned with a smile of great
gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the pen is mightier than the mule stick in his eyes,
the scoundrel,&rdquo; remarked my Uncle, the General Robert, as I
drove to the Capitol with him in his car, while the Gouverneur
Faulkner took his guest with him in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is any proof been found that he shall not do this robbery
to France, my Uncle Robert?&rdquo; I asked with great
eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trap is about ready to spring, but not quite. God, but
Jeff Whitworth is a skilled thief! I know what he is up to but I
can&rsquo;t quite get it on the surface. Keep the French robber
busy, boy, for a little longer, and I&rsquo;ll land him. Here we
are at the office! Now you get busy keeping them busy&mdash;and
I&rsquo;ll land &rsquo;em. If not, I&rsquo;ll go and show France
what real fighting is and I&rsquo;ll take you with me into the
worst trench they&rsquo;ve got! Battles, indeed&mdash;they ought to
have been at Chickamauga. Now depart!&rdquo; With which words my
Uncle, the General Robert, got out of the car and left me to direct
it to wherever I chose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a warmth at heart that the three men most beloved
of me would go onto the French battle line with me,&rdquo; I
murmured to myself as the black chauffeur drove me back to that
Club of Old Hickory to get me again in company of my Buzz.
&ldquo;And yet it is the custom of women to believe that they
command the deepest affection of which a man is possessed. And,
<em>helas</em>, it is believed to be impossible for a comrade that
he be also a lover!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been my good fortune to be one of the guests at many very
brilliant receptions of much state in some of the very grand and
ancient palaces of the different countries of Europe, but at none
of them have I seen a greater brilliancy than at the one given in
his Mansion by the Gouverneur Faulkner of the State of Harpeth in
America. All of that old Mansion, which has the high ceilings and
the decorations of a palace, if not quite the size, was adorned
with very large masses of a most lovely and handsome flower, which
is of many shades of a pink hue set in dark and shining leaves and
which is called the rhododendron. There were many lights and music
of a softness I have never heard equaled, because the souls of
those black men seem to be formed for a very strange kind of music.
Also I had never beheld women of a more loveliness than those of
the State of Harpeth, who had come from many small cities near to
Hayesville at an invitation of very careful selection for their
beauty by my Buzz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give him a genuine dazzle,&rdquo; he had
remarked while making a list for the sending of the cards.</p>
<p>And most beautiful of all those beautiful <em>grande dames</em>
was that Madam Patricia Whitworth, who, with her husband, stood at
the side of His Excellency, the great Gouverneur Faulkner, for the
receiving of his guests. Her eyes of the blue flowers set in the
snow of crystals were in a gleaming and the costume that she wore
was but a few wisps of gossamer used for the revealing of her
radiant body. In my black and stiff attire of the raven I stood
near to the other hand of the Gouverneur Faulkner and there was
such an anger for her in my heart that it was difficult that I made
a return of the smile she cast upon me at every few minutes. Was
there a mockery in that smile, that she had discovered my
woman&rsquo;s estate and was using her own beauty for a challenge
to me? I could not tell nor could I judge exactly what the smile of
boldness which the Lieutenant, the Count de Bourdon, cast upon me,
might mean. And in doubt and anxiety I stood there in that great
salon for many hours to make conversation with the guest of honor
easy with those who came to him for presentation, until at last I
was so weary that I could not make even a good night to my Uncle,
the General Robert, when we entered, long after midnight, the doors
of Twin Oaks.</p>
<p>When in my own apartment, alone with the beautiful Grandmamma, I
cast myself upon the bed upon which my father had had birth, and
wept with all my woman&rsquo;s heart which beat so hard under that
attire of the raven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarcely one more day and perhaps I must flee in dishonor
from all the love of these friends,&rdquo; I sobbed to myself, but
deeper than all that I wept for the picture of that beautiful woman
at the side of my beloved Gouverneur Faulkner.</p>
<p>And then suddenly as I lay in my weeping the telephone upon the
table beside my bed gave a loud ringing in the darkness that was
long after midnight. Very quickly from fear I covered my head with
my pillow and waited with a great fluttering of heart.</p>
<p>Then a second time it rang with a great fury and I perceived
that I must make a response to it.</p>
<p>I arose and took that receiver into my hand and spoke with a
fine though husky calmness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Robert?&rdquo; came the voice of my beloved
Gouverneur, which made the heart of that anguished Roberta,
Marquise of Grez and Bye, beat into a sudden great happiness though
also alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you dress very quietly, get your car and come up here
to the Mansion without letting anybody know of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do what you command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need you, boy, and I need you quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop the car at the street beyond the side door and come
in that way. Cato will let you in. Come to my bedroom quietly so as
not to wake Jenkins. Can you find your way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For just one single long second that <em>grande dame</em>,
Roberta, the Marquise of Grez and Bye, cowered in fear upon her
warm bed in the house of her Uncle, the General Robert, at the
thought of going out into the night at the command of a man, and
then that devoted daredevil, Mr. Robert Carruthers, answered into
the telephone to the Gouverneur Faulkner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately I come to you.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE TALL TIMBERS OF OLD HARPETH</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Is it that there comes to the world an hour in the twenty and
four in which it lays aside the mortality of the earth and clothes
itself in an immortality of a very great awe? I think that it is
so; and it was out into the whiteness of that hour that I stepped
when I had successfully passed from my room to the garden of the
home of my Uncle, the General Robert, which is also the home of my
American ancestors. A command for my presence had come to me from
the loved Gouverneur Faulkner and it was needful that I make all
possible haste; but it seemed to me that all of the beautiful faded
flowers of my dead grandmammas in that garden rose up around me for
beguilement and gave to me a perfume that they had kept in saving
for the Roberta, some day to come across the waters to them. And
all of their little descendants, the opening blossoms of spring,
also gave perfume to me in a mist in the white moonlight, while a
few fragrant rose vines bent to detain me as I left that home of my
grandmothers to go out into that sleeping city, alone. I had a
great fear, but yet a great devotion drew me and in a very few
minutes I had driven my Cherry from the garage and was on my way
through the silent streets to&mdash;I did not know what.</p>
<p>At the door of the Mansion I was admitted by my good Cato, who
was attired in a very long red flannel sleeping garment, with a red
cap also of the flannel tied down upon the white wool of his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has you got dat hoodoo, little Mas&rsquo;?&rdquo; he
demanded of me as I passed into the hall beneath the candle in a
tall stand of silver which he held high over my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, good Cato,&rdquo; I made answer to him and I was
indeed glad that I had now of a habit put his gift under the heel
of my left foot. It gave me great courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;De Governor is up in his room and you kin go right up. I
never heard of no such doings as is going on in dis house dis night
with that there wild man with a gun five feet long, coming and
going like de wind. Go on up, honey, and see what you kin do to dem
with dat hoodoo.&rdquo; With which information good Cato started me
up the stairs. &ldquo;First door to the right, front, and
don&rsquo;t knock,&rdquo; he called in a whisper that might have
come from his tomb in death as he slowly retired into the darkness
below with his candle.</p>
<p>For a very long minute I stood before that door in the dim light
that came through one of the wide windows from the moon
without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this madness that you perform, Roberta, Marquise
of Grez and Bye?&rdquo; I made demand of myself while my knees
trembled in the trousers of heavy gray worsted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert Carruthers goes to his chief in an hour of need
and he is descended of that Madam Donaldson who had no fear of the
Indian or the bear when there was danger to her beloved,&rdquo; I
made answer to myself and softly I turned the handle of that door
and entered the room of the Gouverneur Faulkner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Robert?&rdquo; came a question in his voice
from a large table over by the window. The room was entirely in
shadow, except for the shaded light upon the table, under whose
rays I remarked the head and shoulders of that Gouverneur Faulkner,
at whose bidding I had come out into the dead of the night.
&ldquo;Come over here and walk softly, so as not to stir up
Jenkins,&rdquo; he commanded me and I went immediately to his side,
even if I did experience a difficulty in the breath of Roberta,
Marquise of Grez and Bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that you wish, my Gouverneur Faulkner?&rdquo;
I asked as I looked down upon him as he sat with a paper in his
hand regarding it intently. And as I looked I observed that he, as
well as I, had not entirely disrobed after that very brilliant
reception. He had discarded his coat of the raven and also what is
called a vest in America, and he was very beautiful to me in the
whiteness of his very fine linen above which his dark bronze hair
with its silver crests, that I had always observed to be in a very
sleek order, was tossed into a mop that resembled the usual
appearance of my own. His eyes were very deep under their heavy
lashes but of the brilliancy of the stars in the blackness of a
dark night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down here under the light beside me,&rdquo; was his
next command to me, and he reached out one of his slender and
powerful hands and drew me down into a chair very close beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked as my head came so close to
his that I felt the warmth of his breath on my cold cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold these two fragments of paper together and translate
the French written upon them literally,&rdquo; he said to me as he
handed me two small pieces of paper upon which there was
writing.</p>
<p>And this is what I discovered to be written:</p>
<blockquote>"Honored Madam:
<p>"The one at the head of all has sent me to this place to inspect
grazing lands and make report. I send in a report of what is not
here and the signing of the papers by your Gouverneur Faulkner must
be done quickly in blindness before a discovery of what is
not--"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is written to a woman,&rdquo; I said very quietly as I
made a finish of reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, boy, to a woman. I have made my last fight
to&mdash;to hold an old belief, which in some way seemed to
be&mdash;be one of my foundation stones. The General is right: they
are all alike, the soft, beautiful, lying things. The truth is not
in them, and their own or a man&rsquo;s honor is a plaything. That
piece of paper was sent me by a man up in the mountains of Old
Harpeth, who loves me with the same blood bond that I love you,
boy, all on account of a gun struck up in the hands of his enemy.
Here&rsquo;s the note he sent with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bill, we cotched a furren man fer a revenue up by the
still at Turkey Gulch and this was in his pocket. I made out to
read yo name. I send it. The man is kept tied. What is mules worth?
Send price and what to do with this man critter by son Jim. Hell,
Bill, they ain&rsquo;t no grazing fer five thousand mules on
Paradise Ridge, but I know a place.</p>
<p class="indent4">&ldquo;Jim Todd.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What is the significance of this paper, my Gouverneur
Faulkner?&rdquo; I asked after I had made the attempt to translate
to myself the very peculiar writing he had given to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know just exactly myself, Robert,&rdquo;
answered my Gouverneur Faulkner as he dropped his head upon his
hands while he rested his elbows on the polished table among its
scattered papers. &ldquo;I am convinced now that this mule contract
business is the plot against my honor that the General believes it
to be and has been trying to get to a legal surface. In some way
Jim Todd has got hold of one end of the conspiracy. It has been
hard for me to believe that a woman would sell me out. If I take it
to her in the morning I&rsquo;ll perhaps get an explanation that
will satisfy me. The men who are in with Jeff Whitworth are the
best financiers in the State and it is impossible to believe
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very suddenly it happened in my heart to know what to compel
that very large man beside me to do for the rescue of his honor. He
must see the matter, not through the lies of that beautiful Madam
Whitworth, the instrument of that very ugly husband, but he must
look into the matter with his blood friend, that Mr. Jim Todd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go immediately to that Mr. Jim Todd and his
prisoner to discover truth, Your Excellency,&rdquo; I said with a
very firm determination as I looked straight into his sad eyes that
had in them almost the look of shame for dishonor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s twenty-four hours on horseback across Old
Harpeth from Springtown, boy. The trip would take three days. I
can&rsquo;t do it with these guests here, even if they are robbers.
I&rsquo;ll have to stay and dig down to the root of the matter
here. I may find it in the hearts of my friends,&rdquo; he answered
me with a look of great despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The root of the matter is that man who is a prisoner, my
Gouverneur Faulkner. I say that you go; that you start while yet it
is night and while no man can advise you not to take that journey.
It can be done while this entertainment to the farm of the Brices
is made for the inspection of mules and also the running of horses.
It is necessary!&rdquo; As I spoke to him in that manner a great
force rose in me that I poured out to him through my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heavens, boy, I believe I&rsquo;ll do it. I could
never get anything if I went when they knew I was going, but I
might find out the whole thing if I went to it in secret. If I go
now they&rsquo;ll not have time to get their breath before I am
back. I&rsquo;ll be able to think out there is those hills and
I&rsquo;m&mdash;a&mdash;man who needs to think&mdash;with a vision
unobscured.&rdquo; For a long minute my Gouverneur Faulkner sat
with his head bowed in his hands as he rested his elbows on that
table, then he rose to his feet. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get away while
it is still the dead of night, Robert. I&rsquo;ll leave a note with
Cato to tell the General that I&rsquo;ve taken you, and nobody
except himself must know where I have gone or why. He&rsquo;ll put
up the right bluff and we&rsquo;ll be back before they get anything
out of him. It&rsquo;s three o&rsquo;clock and we must be far out
on the road by daybreak. We&rsquo;ll take your car and leave it in
hiding at Springtown, where by sunup we&rsquo;ll get horses to
cross the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that I must go for three days out into those
mountains with you, my Gouverneur Faulkner?&rdquo; faltered that
ridiculous and troublesome Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Robert, unless&mdash;unless&mdash;Oh, well, I
suppose this prisoner of Jim&rsquo;s can speak English as they all
can. I rather wanted you&mdash;but perhaps it is best for me to
fight it out alone. Will you help me pack a bag? Get the one from
my dressing room while I take a plunge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Robert Carruthers, make an excuse to that Roberta,
Marquise of Grez and Bye, who is of such a foolishness, that you
must go with your beloved Gouverneur Faulkner for his aid,&rdquo; I
said to myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is necessary that your foreign secretary accompany you
to deal with that gentleman of France who is in prison, my
Gouverneur Faulkner,&rdquo; I said with decision as I rose from the
side of the table with a great quickness. &ldquo;I must return home
for a few necessities of my toilet for those three days, but I will
be back in what that good Kizzie says to be a jiffy, when speaking
of cooking that is delayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; answered me my beloved Gouverneur Faulkner.
Then he laid his hand upon my shoulder as we stood together in the
dimness out from the rays of the light. &ldquo;There is something
in your eyes, Robert, that renews my faith in the truths
of&mdash;of life. I&rsquo;m going out into the wilderness on a
grave mission whose result may shake down some houses of&mdash;of
cards, but because of your being with me I feel as if I were
starting off on a picnic or a day&rsquo;s fishing at the age of
ten. Now, I&rsquo;ll hurry.&rdquo; And as he spoke my Gouverneur
Faulkner made a start in the direction of his room for the
bath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that I may begin the packing of your bag for you,
Your Excellency, before I go for those necessities of my
own?&rdquo; I asked of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be time for you to go home, boy,&rdquo; he
answered me, looking at a clock upon the mantel over his large
fireplace. &ldquo;You are still in your evening clothes, I see. But
that&rsquo;s easy: you climb into that pink coat and a pair of
those corduroy trousers of mine you see hanging in my dressing
room. I haven&rsquo;t hunted for two years but they are still
there. Put linen in that saddlebag on the shelf for us both out of
the drawers in the old chest over there. Take heavy socks to go
under the leggings. You&rsquo;d better put on a flannel shirt, too,
and take an extra one for both of us. We&rsquo;ll travel light.
I&rsquo;ll only be in the bath a couple of minutes.&rdquo; With
which assurance he entered the room of the bath and closed the door
upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu</em>, Roberta, Marquise of Grez and
Bye!&rdquo; was all that I allowed myself to exclaim as I made a
very quick rush for that dressing room, switched on the light,
flung off my coat, seized a pair of corduroy riding breeches that
hung in a corner beside another pair, discarded my own of
broadcloth and struggled with both of my legs the same moment into
them. Then in a hurry as great as I shall ever know I discovered a
gray flannel shirt in a drawer of the very tall old mahogany chest
and inserted myself into that with an equal rapidity. A wide
leather belt made the two very large garments secure around my
waist and I again allowed breath to come into my lungs. I then
opened a very queer bag which I knew to be for a saddle, that was
upon a shelf in the dressing room, and began to put things into it
according to directions of the Gouverneur Faulkner. The other pair
of those riding breeches I laid with another of the flannel shirts
in a great conspicuousness upon a chair in the bedroom directly in
front of the door from the dressing room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to make a record get-away, boy,&rdquo;
said that Gouverneur Faulkner to me as in a few minutes he came,
clothed in those riding trousers and that flannel shirt, to the
door of his dressing room, where I was just making a finish of
putting needful clothing into his bag. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the
other things we need in the bathroom. Put it all in while I get
together a few papers I want. We can start now in two
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is ready now, my Gouverneur Faulkner,&rdquo; I made
the announcement after a wading into that very wet room of the bath
and a return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, give me the bag, and you go ahead with this
electric torch. Quiet now,&rdquo; admonished that Gouverneur
Faulkner to me as we took our departure through the dark hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the maddest escapade that a Governor of this
ancient State has ever undertaken, and the weight of years has slid
from me, boy,&rdquo; said that Gouverneur Faulkner to me as the
Cherry made a long glide from the city out into the open road.</p>
<p>The day was just beginning to come with its light from behind
the very large and crooked old mountain that is called Old Harpeth,
when my Gouverneur Faulkner made me to turn my good Cherry from off
the main road into a little road, of much narrowness and of
beautiful brown dirt the color of the riding trousers that I wore,
and stop beside a very humble, small house, which was covered with
a vine in beautiful bud, and around which many chickens hovered in
waiting for a morning breakfast. Behind the small house was a large
barn and as I made a nice turn and stop beside the white gate a man
in a blue garment that I now know is called overalls, came to the
door of the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bud. Are Lightfoot and Steady in good condition
for a trip across to Turkey-Gulch?&rdquo; called my Gouverneur
Faulkner as he alighted from the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fit as fiddles, Governor Bill,&rdquo; answered the man as
he came to the gate to shake hands with the Gouverneur Faulkner.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Light and come in to breakfast. Granny has got a
couple of chickens already in the skillet. And say, I want you to
see what Mandy have got in the bed with her. Ten pounds,
Gov.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, Bud; that is some&mdash;boy?&rdquo; said
my Gouverneur Faulkner with a question as he again grasped the hand
of the large man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw, Gov; we didn&rsquo;t have no luck this first shot
but I tells Mandy that we&rsquo;ve got about a dozen more chanstes
if she does as well by me as she oughter. Anyway what&rsquo;s the
matter with a gal child?&rdquo; And the nice young father of the
poor little female made a bristle of his disposition in defense of
his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing on earth, Bud; except that the whole sex are
the unknown quantity. This is my secretary, Robert Carruthers, the
General&rsquo;s nephew. Come in, Robert, and you&rsquo;ll have one
square meal in your life if you never get another. Get me the usual
food wallet together, Bud, please, and let me have it and the
horses the very moment I&rsquo;ve swallowed the last bite of my
drum bone, will you? We&rsquo;ve got to ride fast and far to-day
and I want nobody on my trail. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, Gov,&rdquo; was the answer that good Bud man made as
my Gouverneur Faulkner and I took our way through many chickens
into the low little house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul, if here ain&rsquo;t the Governor come
for a bite with Granny Bell this fine morning!&rdquo; exclaimed a
very nice old lady from above a stove, which was steaming with food
of such an odor as to create a madness in my very empty
stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than any bite, Granny,&rdquo; answered my Gouverneur
Faulkner as he came beside the stove to shake hands with the nice
hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to feed you some gold, fried in silk.
Governor Bill, fer that mercy to my nephew Timms. I can&rsquo;t say
what I feels and finish this cream gravy the right color for
you,&rdquo; and as she spoke the fine old friend of my Gouverneur
Faulkner wept as she shook a steaming sauce in a black pan and
turned with the left hand a golden piece of bread upon another part
of the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need anything more than your &lsquo;well
done,&rsquo; Granny,&rdquo; answered my Gouverneur Faulkner as he
laid a gentle hand on the trembling shoulder of the nice old lady.
&ldquo;This youngster here got the word from Mary and you can give
him both of the liver wings if you want to show your gratitude to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, young gentleman, and you shall have
anything that Granny Bell has to give you in gratitude. Now draw up
two chairs and fall to, boys,&rdquo; and as she spoke she set the
dishes of a beautiful odor upon a very clean table beside the
stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that I may wash the grease stains of the car from
my hands before eating, dear Madam?&rdquo; I asked of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back porch, you&rsquo;ll find the bucket and pan and
towel, youngster. I can&rsquo;t wait for you,&rdquo; made answer my
Gouverneur Faulkner as he laughed and began upon the repast that
must of necessity be a hurried one.</p>
<h2><a id="ChXVIII" name="ChXVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>
<h3>THE CAMP HEAVEN</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>And I was very glad indeed that he did not go with me for that
toilet to my hands, for it might have happened that a noise would
have deprived me of a very beautiful thing that I discovered,
through a window under a vine of roses that opened upon that back
porch.</p>
<p>A very pretty young girl, with hair the color of the maize in
the fields, lay upon a white bed beneath a quilt of many colors.
Her sleeping garment was drawn back from her breast, against which
lay a little human person drinking therefrom with much energy. The
eyes of the mother were closed and her arm held the babe loosely as
if in a deep dreaming. I softly poured the water into the basin,
made clean my hands and quietly withdrew into the kitchen, with
much care that I did not awaken her. On my cheeks I could feel a
deep glow of color, and something within my heart pounded with
force against my own breast under its gay red coat of a hunting
man. I could not raise my eyes to those of my Gouverneur Faulkner
and I ate not as much of that good breakfast as Robert Carruthers
could have consumed if the woman in his heart had not been so
stirred.</p>
<p>And all of that long day in the soft early spring which was
bursting into a budding and a flowering under the feet of our
horses and above our heads in the trees, it was the woman Roberta
that rode at the side of my Gouverneur Faulkner, with her heart at
an ache under her coat of a man. It was with a difficulty that I
forced my eyes to meet and make answer to the merriment and joy of
the woods in his deep ones; and I was of a great gladness when the
descending of the sun brought a moon-silvered twilight down upon us
from the young green branches of the large trees of the forest
through which we rode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to make camp. We&rsquo;ve got to old Jutting Rock.
You are halfway up between heaven and earth, youngster,&rdquo; said
my Gouverneur Faulkner as he drew to a halt his horse in front of
me and pointed down into the dim valley that lay at our feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad that we have made this Camp Heaven,&rdquo; I
answered to him as I slid from my horse, ungirthed him, and drew
from his back the heavy saddle he had worn for the day, as I had
been taught by my father to do after a day&rsquo;s hunting, if no
grooms came immediately. &ldquo;Is it that you have hunger, my
Gouverneur Faulkner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only about ten pounds of food craving,&rdquo; he made
answer to me with a large laugh that was the first I had ever heard
him to give forth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rustle the fire and water if
you&rsquo;ll open the food wallet and feed the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately I will do all of that,&rdquo; I made an
answer to him and because of the happiness of that laugh he had
given forth, a gladness rose in my heart that made me again that
merry boy Robert.</p>
<p>And it was with a great industry for a short hour that we
prepared the Camp Heaven for a sojourn of a night. Upon a very nice
hot fire I put good bacon to cook and my Gouverneur set also the
pot of coffee upon the coals. Then, while I made crisp with the
heat the brown corn pones, with which that Granny Bell had provided
us, he brought a large armful of a very fragrant kind of tree and
threw it not far into the shadow of the great tree which was the
roof to our Camp Heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bed,&rdquo; he said as he came and stood beside the fire
in a large towering over me. I dropped beyond rescue a fragment of
that corn bread into the extreme heat of the coals, but I said with
a great composure and a briefness like unto his words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it that a man thinks he wants more of life&rsquo;s
goods than fatigue, supper and bed, do you suppose, boy?&rdquo;
questioned my Gouverneur Faulkner to me as at last in repletion he
leaned back against our giant rooftree, between two of whose
hospitable large roots we had made our repast, and lighted a pipe
of great fragrance which he had taken from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not possess happiness even though I had this nice
supper, if I was alone in this great forest, Your Excellency; I
would have fear,&rdquo; I answered him with a small laugh as I took
my corduroy knees into my embrace and looked off into that distant
valley below us which was beginning to glow with stars of home
lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you once that you don&rsquo;t count,
that you are just myself, youngster? You ought not to know I am
here. I don&rsquo;t know you exist except as a form of pleasure of
which I do not ask the reason,&rdquo; was the answer that my
Gouverneur Faulkner made to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I excuse myself away with humbleness for impertinence,
Your Excellency,&rdquo; I returned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you tried, do you think you could call me Bill, just
for to-night, boy?&rdquo; was the answer he made to my excuses as
he puffed a beautiful ring of smoke at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not,&rdquo; I answered with an indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you call Sue Tomlinson &lsquo;Sue&rsquo; the
first night you danced with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that Mademoiselle Sue is a woman, my Gouverneur
Faulkner,&rdquo; I answered with haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason that women get at us to do us,
youngster; we don&rsquo;t approach them as human to human but we go
up on their blind side and they come back at us in the dark with a
knife.&rdquo; And as he spoke all of the gayness of joy was lost
from the voice of my beloved Gouverneur and in its place was a
bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pardon I say that it is not a truth of all women,
Your Excellency,&rdquo; I answered with pride as my head went up
high at his condemnation of the sex of which I was one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about,
youngster. They all think I am cold and pass me along, except a few
experienced ladies who&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;adventure for graft
with me. I&rsquo;ve been too busy really to love or let love but I
know &rsquo;em and you don&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s stop talking about
what concerns neither of us and go to bed. See this young cedar
tree? I&rsquo;m going to throw my blanket across it and with these
extra boughs I&rsquo;ll make a genuine cradle for each of us on the
opposite sides of the trunk. Then we&rsquo;ll cover with your
blanket and be as comfortable as two middies in their hammocks in a
man of war. This is a piece of woodcraft of my own invention and
I&rsquo;m proud of it, old scout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while he talked my Gouverneur Faulkner had prepared those
cradles of our blankets unstrapped from the saddles of the horses
at feeding time, seated himself upon the edge of one of them and
began to pull from his feet his riding boots. &ldquo;Take off your
boots and your coat, youngster, and turn in. I&rsquo;ll take the
windward side and you can bivouac against the fire. Good
night!&rdquo; As he finished speaking my Gouverneur Faulkner rolled
beneath that blanket upon the outer edge and left for me the
hammock next to the fire, sheltered from a cool wind that had begun
to come up from the valley.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, so that I should not have a fright, I lifted
the blanket and crawled into the branches of the fragrant tree.
Even as I did so I perceived a loud breathing of deep sleep from my
Gouverneur Faulkner; but to me came no repose.</p>
<p>Awake through the bright night, I lay there in the sweet
branches of the young tree beside the great Gouverneur of one of
the greatest states of America and perceived clearly the pass to
which my course of lies and dishonor had led me. And from that wild
daredevil, Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, was born the honest
woman Roberta who must extricate herself from a situation not to be
longer endured, even if discovery was not upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will finish this journey with my beloved Gouverneur
Faulkner,&rdquo; I counseled myself, &ldquo;upon which it is of a
certainty that this plot for his ruin in the world of his politics
will be averted, and I will return to the home of my Uncle, the
General Robert. If I be not discovered in my woman&rsquo;s estate
in a few days&rsquo; space of time I will endeavor to do some piece
of loving kindness that will keep me in the memory of all who have
given me love, from poor black Bonbon up to His Excellency himself
here beside me, and then I will go into those trenches of France to
give my life for my country, perhaps not as a soldier but as a good
nurse of the Red Cross. And never, never, must any living person
who has loved Robert Carruthers know that he is a human of
dishonor. Nannette will be true to my directions to hide my secret,
and wee Pierre will keep it forever because I go to fight for
France as he cannot. I will put with great firmness into the mind
of Pierre that he is to be of a great devotion to my Uncle, the
General Robert, through life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will you do for that great Gouverneur Faulkner,
from whom each day you have stolen more and more affection with
your false attitude of much loyalty, to keep from him grief at the
loss of you?&rdquo; I asked myself with a sob in my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, my beloved chief. When away from you I must
die of a coldness,&rdquo; I said to myself in a very low tone into
the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold? Do you want the whole blanket, youngster? Snuggle
into your cradle closer,&rdquo; suddenly answered me my Gouverneur
Faulkner as he reached his long arm across the tree trunk to tuck
in the blanket about me and again he was immediately in the deep
sleep from which my spoken words had but partly awakened him. And
then at his bidding I did settle myself down into the fragrant
boughs and I wept myself also into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>The round sun was high over that Old Harpeth hill when I opened
my eyes. For a moment I did not see clearly and then I looked
straight into the deep eyes of my Gouverneur Faulkner. which for
that first time I had been able to see to be the color of violets
in the twilight. He was seated beside me smoking the fragrant pipe
and looking down at me with a great wonderment that was mingled
with as great a tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he asked softly, &ldquo;are you sure God has
got that pattern of you put away carefully in France?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I could make answer to him a picture flashed into my
mind. When still a child one morning I opened my eyes to find my
loved father bending over me and in the hollow of his arm he held
my mother in her breakfast gown of lace and ribbons. He spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day, Celeste, a man will bend over her and watch her
waken. God grant it will be with the love&mdash;that produced that
beauty. Look at that love curl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at the recall of that picture of me into my mind, my hands
flew to my face to find that same treacherous curl had descended to
my cheek from the mop above. With a fury of embarrassment I sprang
to my feet from under that blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a great hunger,&rdquo; I said as I observed a very
crisp breakfast to be prepared upon the coals of the fire. &ldquo;I
must have a fragment of bacon upon the instant.&rdquo; And I bent
over the fire to obtain what I had demanded for a cover to my
confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t, until you&rsquo;ve washed that face
and those hands that still have the supper smudge on them, in the
pool down there. I left the soap and the dry sleeves and bosom of a
flannel shirt for you. Don&rsquo;t you pack towels in a kit in your
country?&rdquo; With which laughing answer my Gouverneur Faulkner
denied unto me an immediate breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought him to admire the love curl, while he was
remarking the soil upon your face, Roberta, Marquise of Grez and
Bye,&rdquo; I laughed to myself as I plunged my face into the icy
pool.</p>
<p>After a finish to the breakfast, my Gouverneur Faulkner gave to
me the information that we must tether the good horses and make the
remainder of the journey by walking, which we did for hardly a
short hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wildcat still is straight up Turkey Gulch and
we&rsquo;ll have to scramble for it. It&rsquo;s hid like the nest
of an old turkey hen,&rdquo; he said to me as we set out upon the
mounting of a very steep precipice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that word, &lsquo;wildcat still&rsquo;?&rdquo; I
asked as I slid over a great rock with emerald moss encrusted, and
struggled beside my Gouverneur Faulkner through a heavy underbrush
of leafy greenness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A place where men make whiskey in defiance of the law of
their State,&rdquo; he answered me as he held aside a long branch
of green that was pink tipped, so that I might slip thereunder
without a scratching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not the law of the State, my Gouverneur
Faulkner?&rdquo; I asked of him as I pulled myself by his arm
through the thickness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all that, but I&rsquo;m the son of Old Harpeth
and Jim Todd&rsquo;s blood brother first. Some day I&rsquo;ll smoke
Jim out of his hole and get him a good job. Now, wait a minute and
see what happens,&rdquo; and as he spoke my Gouverneur Faulkner
stood very still for a long minute. As I sat at his side upon the
fallen trunk of a large tree I regarded him with admiration,
because he had the aspect of some beautiful, lithe animal of the
woods as he listened with a deep attention. Then very quickly he
put his two long fingers to his mouth, and behold the call of a
wild bird came from between his lips. Twice it was repeated and
then he stood again in deep attention. I made not even a little
breathing as I too listened.</p>
<p>Then came three clear notes of that same wild bird in reply from
not very far up the mountain from us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jim, the old turkey; come on!&rdquo; said my
Gouverneur Faulkner as he again began to break through the leafy
barriers of the low trees.</p>
<p>And in a very short space of time a man emerged from a little
path that led behind a tall cliff of the gray rocks. He was a very
large and a very fierce man and I might have had a fright of him if
his blue eyes had not held such a kindness and joy in them at the
sight of my Gouverneur Faulkner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Bill,&rdquo; he said with no handshake or other
form of a comrade&rsquo;s greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Jim,&rdquo; returned my Gouverneur Faulkner in a
manner of the same indifference but with also an expression in his
face of delight at the sight of his blood brother, that Mr. Jim
Todd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thar boy a shet-mouth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Bob, and as hard as a nut,&rdquo; was the
introduction I had from my Gouverneur Faulkner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come on,&rdquo; with which command that wild man led
us around the tall cliff of gray rock, over which climbed a sweet
vine of rosy blossoming, which I now know to call a laurel, and we
arrived in front of a small and low hut that was built against the
rocks. A clear, small stream made a very noisy way past the door of
the hut, but save for its clamor all was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the boys?&rdquo; asked my Gouverneur
Faulkner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hid in the bushes. I&rsquo;ve got the man tied back in
the still room. I &rsquo;low he ain&rsquo;t no revenue but they
&rsquo;low different. Come back and see if you kin make out his
gibberish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Robert,&rdquo; said my Gouverneur Faulkner to me
as he followed the wild Jim into the hut and back into a room that
was as a cave cut into the rock. And I, Robert Carruthers, followed
him&mdash;to my death.</p>
<p>Seated upon a rude bench in that cave room, bound with a rope of
great size, disheveled and soiled, but with all of the nobility of
his great estate in his grave face, was my adored friend,
Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles! As we entered he rose beside the
bench and in that rising displayed a chain by which one of his feet
was made fast to the rock of the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; said my Gouverneur Faulkner, as
if greeting a gentleman upon the street of that city of
Hayesville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also a good morning, sir,&rdquo; made reply my poor
Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles. And he stood with a fine and
great courtesy waiting for my Gouverneur Faulkner to state to him
what his visit could portend, as would he have done in his
regimental room at Tour.</p>
<p>And as he stood, for that very long minute, there expired the
last moments of the life of Robert Carruthers. A stream of light
fell from the little window high in the rock upon his luckless head
as he stood as if frozen into a statue of great fear. And as he so
stood, the eyes of the Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, fell upon
him and he started forward as far as the length of the chain by
which he was bound would allow him and from there held out his hand
to the frozen boy standing in the stream of light from high
heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My most beautiful lady Roberta, do I find that it is you
who have come to my rescue?&rdquo; he questioned. &ldquo;I lost
you, <em>mon enfant</em>, in that great New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My beloved Capitaine, how is it that I find you
thus?&rdquo; I exclaimed as I went to within his reach and allowed
that he take my two hands in his poor shackled ones and put warm
kisses of greeting upon them.</p>
<p>And it was while I was shedding tears of pity for the
imprisonment of that great man of France in that mountain hut in
America, as he kissed my hands, that I raised my eyes to encounter
a cold lightning as of a flash on steel, from under the black brows
of my Gouverneur Faulkner of the State of Harpeth, that again froze
the blood in my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; he asked of me in a voice that was of the
same coldness and sharpness as that steel, and his beautiful mouth
was set into one straight line as he flung into my face that one
word.</p>
<h2><a id="ChXIX" name="ChXIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>
<h3>ALL IS LOST</h3>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>And to that word of challenge I made no answer, but I raised my
head and looked into his eyes with a dignity that came to me as my
right from suffering. So regarding each other, we stood for a very
short minute in which the Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, raised
his head from his kisses of salutation upon my hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, <em>mon enfant</em>, is this the good Uncle to whose
care you came into America?&rdquo; asked that Capitaine, the Count
de Lasselles, as he reached out his imprisoned hands for a greeting
to my relative.</p>
<p>I did not make any answer to that question. My head raised
itself yet higher, and I looked my Gouverneur Faulkner again full
in the face while I waited to hear what he would answer of my
kinship to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I am the friend of General Carruthers and I am also
the Governor of the State of Harpeth. I have come across the
mountains to talk with you about the business of this contract for
mules for your army and I have brought your young friend to assist
me if I should need translating from or to you. We Americans,
Captain, are poor handlers of any language not our own, and the
matter is of much gravity.&rdquo; And as the Gouverneur Faulkner
spoke those words to my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, with a
great courtesy but also a great sternness, in which he named me not
as his friend but as the friend of that Capitaine, the Count de
Lasselles, I knew that I was placed by him among all women liars of
the world and that to him his boy Robert of honor was of a truth
dead forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed of such a gravity that I have come from the
English Canada to make all clear to myself,&rdquo; answered my
beloved Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, as he drew himself to
his entire height, which was well-nigh as great as that of the
Gouverneur of the State of Harpeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have ridden a day and a night, sir, for the same
purpose,&rdquo; answered my great Gouverneur Faulkner with that
beautiful courtesy of business I have always observed him to use in
the transaction of his affairs in his office at the Capitol of the
State of Harpeth. &ldquo;And as one of us must make a beginning,
will you not tell me, Captain, why you are here and in this
predicament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few words I will make all clear to you, Your
Excellency,&rdquo; made answer my Capitaine, the Count de
Lasselles, with an air of courtesy equal to that of the Gouverneur
Faulkner. &ldquo;I sent down into your State of Harpeth one of my
Commission, to whom I gave the direction that with a lack of
annoying publicity he should investigate the preparedness of the
State of Harpeth to deliver those five thousand of mules to the
Republique of France as was being proposed. Behold, a report that
all is well comes to me, but&mdash;ah, it is with sorrow and shame
that such a thing could be done by a son of poor France who
struggles for life!&mdash;among the sheets of that report was left
by mistake the fragments of a draft of a letter to an American
woman, which made a partial disclosure of an intended falseness of
that statement to me. Immediately I came alone to interview that
false officer and I find him gone from that small town not far from
here into your Capital. I was seeking to rapidly ride alone by
directions into your Capital city to prevent that he make a
signature, which I had given to him the authority to write, to
those papers of so great an importance. I was thus arrested by that
man of great wildness, whose <em>patois</em> I could not understand
as he could not comprehend the English I make use of, and you see
me thus. I beg of you to tell me if that wicked signature has been
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The papers have not been signed, thank God, Captain, and
your very impatient lieutenant is being shown some Southern
hospitality by the flower and chivalry of Old Harpeth. And I beg
your pardon for allowing you to be a prisoner a minute longer than
necessary,&rdquo; was the answer made to him by my Gouverneur
Faulkner. &ldquo;Untie the Captain, Jim; he&rsquo;s all right. And
you can bring us a little of your mountain dew while I clear this
table here to use for the papers of our business.&rdquo; And still
my Gouverneur Faulkner did not speak or look at me and in my heart
I then knew that he never would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make all ready,&rdquo; I said as I lifted a large
gun, a horn of a beast full of powder and several pipes with
tobacco, from the table of rough boards that stood under the window
for light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is a good release! Thank you that you did not
make tight enough for abrasions your cords, my good man,&rdquo;
said my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, as he stretched out his
arms and then bent to make a rubbing of his ankle upon which had
been the chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said you warn&rsquo;t no revenue. Here, drink,
stranger!&rdquo; answered the wild Jim as he handed a bottle of
white liquid to my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, and also
another to my Gouverneur Faulkner. &ldquo;That boy can suck the
drippings,&rdquo; he added as he looked at me with humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get cups and water, Jim,&rdquo; commanded my Gouverneur
Faulkner with a smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drink it straight,
Captain. It will knock you down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will procure the cups and the water,&rdquo; I said with
rapidity, for I longed to leave that room for a few moments in
which to shake from my eyes some of the tears that were making a
mist before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git a fresh bucket from the spring up the gulch, Bob,
while I go beat the boys outen the bushes with the news that they
ain&rsquo;t no revenue. They&rsquo;ll want to see Bill,&rdquo; was
the direction that wild Jim gave to me as he placed in my hand a
rude bucket and pointed up the side of the hill of great steepness.
After so doing he descended around the rock by the path which we
had ascended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that you shall do now, Roberta, Marquise of
Grez and Bye?&rdquo; I wept a question to myself as I dipped that
bucket into a clear pool and made ready to return to the hut.
&ldquo;All is lost to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; I answered to myself.</p>
<p>And when I had made a safe return to the hut with a small
portion of the water only remaining in the bucket, for the cause of
many slides in the steep descent from the pool, I found my
Gouverneur Faulkner and my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles,
engaged deeply in a mass of papers on the table between them and
with no thanks to Roberta, the Marquise of Grez and Bye, when she
served to them tin cups of the water and a liquid that I had
ascertained by tasting to be of fire. I believe it to be thus that
in affairs of business, in the minds of men all women are become
drowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you write this out for His Excellency, my dear
Mademoiselle?&rdquo; would request my good Capitaine, the Count de
Lasselles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; would be the reply I received from the
Gouverneur Faulkner of the State of Harpeth, with never one small
look into my eyes that so besought his.</p>
<p>And for all of the hours of that very long afternoon I sat on a
low stool beside the feet of those two great gentlemen and served
them in their communications while the heart in my breast was going
into death by a slow, cruel torture.</p>
<p>The exact meaning of those papers and words of business I did
not know, but once I observed my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles,
throw down his pencil and look into the face of the Gouverneur
Faulkner with a great and stern astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work of grafters, Captain Lasselles, with a woman as
a tool. But I yet don&rsquo;t see just how it was that she worked
it. My Secretary of State, General Carruthers, and I have been at
work for weeks and we could not catch the exact fraud,&rdquo; made
answer my Gouverneur Faulkner with a cold sternness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was warned in Paris that beautiful American women were
very much interested in the placing of war contracts, Monsieur le
Gouverneur. I fled upon a tug boat from the ship that I escape some
for whom I had letters of introduction which I could not
ignore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, whom that
Madam Whitworth sought upon the ship, Roberta,&rdquo; I said to
myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think women are alike the world over, Captain, and the
discussion of them and their mental and moral processes
is&mdash;fruitless,&rdquo; answered my Gouverneur Faulkner as he
again took up his pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it happened to me to find the fragment of the letter
to the lady of America from my false lieutenant, I had a deep
distress that tenderness for the sufferings of poor France should
fail to be in even one American woman&rsquo;s heart. And now I am
in deep concern. Where am I to obtain the good strong mules by
which to transport through fields heavy with mud the food to my
poor boys in their trenches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here, Captain, I feel reasonably sure. I think I
see a way to give you what you want at a better figure; and from it
no man shall reap more than a just wage for honest work. As the
Governor of the State of Harpeth, I can give you at least that
assurance.&rdquo; And as he spoke my Gouverneur Faulkner looked the
Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, in the eyes with a fine honesty
that carried with it the utmost of conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give thanks to <em>le bon Dieu</em>,&rdquo; I said with
words that were very soft in my throat, but at which I observed the
mouth of that Gouverneur Faulkner to again become as one straight
line of coldness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, thanks to <em>le bon Dieu</em>,
Mademoiselle,&rdquo; made courteous answer to me my Capitaine, the
Count de Lasselles. &ldquo;But how will you accomplish that
purpose. Monsieur le Gouverneur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I&rsquo;ve done with these figures I&rsquo;ll
have in Jim, your jailer, and then you&rsquo;ll hear some things
about the American mountain mule that you never heard before, I
believe.&rdquo; As he spoke, my Gouverneur Faulkner proceeded with
making figures with his pencil, a fine glow of eagerness added to
that of rage in his eyes very deep under their brows. &ldquo;Now,
I&rsquo;ll go and call in Jim,&rdquo; he said after a few minutes
of waiting, and left the room in which I was then alone with my
Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, who came to me with outstretched
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mademoiselle Roberta,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I
am in a debt of gratitude to you for bringing this great gentleman,
your friend, to my rescue and also to the solving of this very
strange situation concerning these contracts. Indeed have you
accomplished the mission for which you enlisted: your
&lsquo;Friends for France.&rsquo; But before procedure I must ask
you, little lady, why it was that you made a vanishment from that
hotel of Ritz-Carlton in New York. I sought you. I sought out that
Monsieur Peter Scudder to inquire for you. Behold, he also is in
sorrow over the loss of you and had for me a strange news of a cup
of tea thrown in the face of that Mr. Raines of Saint Louis by a
member of your family who had departed immediately into the south
of America. I said to myself, &lsquo;The beautiful child does not
know that your heart is in anxiety for her,&rsquo; and immediately
I intended to seek you in the city, to which the very fine lady,
who had reported that &lsquo;tea fight&rsquo; as she so spoke of it
to her paper, directed me after my finding of her. It is a great
ease to my unhappy heart to find you in the care of a family and
friends. I make compliments on your costume of the ride. I also
observed the custom of attire masculine to be on those plains of
the great West where I sought the wheat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great joy to me, <em>mon Capitaine</em>, that you
give to me your approval. Much has happened to me in these short
weeks since you left me in loneliness on that great ship that I
must tell to you,&rdquo; I said as a sob rose into my words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little girl, it will not be many hours now before I
can say to you the things that have been growing in my heart for
you since that night upon the ship,&rdquo; he said to me in a great
tenderness as he raised my hand and bent to kiss it just as entered
the great Gouverneur Faulkner and the wild Jim.</p>
<p>I had not the courage to gaze upon the face of my Gouverneur
Faulkner, but I felt its coldness strike into my body and turn it
to hardness.</p>
<p>For a second I stood as a stone, then a sudden resolve rose in
me and again that daredevil seized upon my thought. I took a piece
of that white paper with caution and also a pencil, and with them
slipped from the room, while that wild Jim seated himself upon my
lowly stool beside the table at which again the two great men were
writing.</p>
<p>And out in the soft light that was now slowly fading from the
side of the mountain because of the retirement of the sun, I sat me
down upon the step of the hut and wrote to my Gouverneur Faulkner
this small letter:</p>
<blockquote>"Honored Excellency, the Gouverneur Faulkner, of the
State of Harpeth:
<p>"I go from you into the trenches of France. If your humble boy
Robert has done for you any small service, I beg of you in that
name that my Uncle, the General Robert, and my friends never know
of my dishonor of lies about my woman's estate, but believe me to
die as a soldier for France as will be the case. Make all clear for
me to my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles. It is that all women
are not lies.</p>
<p class="indent4">Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I left that letter upon the doorstep, held in place by the
weight of a stone, and very softly slipped out into the shadows of
the twilight and down the mountain by the path up which that
morning I had come with my beloved Gouverneur Faulkner, then my
friend. I felt a certainty that as many as two hours would those
men continue in a consulting with that wild Jim and in that time by
going fleetingly I could gain the place where were tethered the
horses, before a complete darkness had come. From my honored father
I had learned the ways of woods in hunting and also I knew that the
good Lightfoot would in darkness carry me in safety to his stall in
the barn of Mr. Bud Bell, beside which stood my Cherry. From there
I could gain the city of Hayesville in the dead hours of the night
and in those same dead hours depart to France, after obtaining the
money I had left in my desk and which I had earned by my labors and
would not be in the act of stealing from the State of Harpeth. Only
one night and day would I be alone in the forest and I did not care
if a death should overtake me. In my body my heart was dead and why
should I desire the life of that body?</p>
<p>And as I had planned I then accomplished. I discovered that
Lightfoot at pasture and I quickly had placed the saddle upon him
and had turned him down the mountain to choose a safe path for both
himself and me. I did not look upon those cradles of fragrant
boughs in which the boy Robert had lain at rest beside his great
friend, the Gouverneur Faulkner, from whom he had stolen faith and
affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did not you also steal his pocketbook as he lay
asleep beside you, Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye?&rdquo; I
questioned myself with scorn and torture, as good Lightfoot crashed
down from that Camp Heaven into the dark night.</p>
<p>And on we rode, the large horse with the woman upon his back,
for a long night, through fragrant thickets that caught at my
riding breeches with rose tendril fingers and under thick forests
of budding trees, through whose branches of tender leaves the wise
old stars looked down upon my bitter weeping with nothing of
comfort, perhaps because they had grown of a hardness of heart from
having seen so many tears of women drop in the silence of a lonely
night.</p>
<p>Then came a dawn and a noon and a twilight through which I
pushed forward the large horse with great cruelty, only pausing
beside streams to allow that he drink of the water and also to
throw myself down on my face and lap the cool refreshment like do
all humble things. And, when at last the stars were again there to
look down upon me, we arrived behind the barn of that Bud Bell to
find all in the little house at rest. I thought of that small child
in sleep in the arms of that woman, and a great sobbing came from
my heart as I threw myself into my Cherry, after giving a supper to
good Lightfoot, and fled down the long road to the distant city of
Hayesville that lay away in the valley like a great nest of
glowworms in a glade of the leaves of darkness. And among those
glowworms I knew that more than a hundred friends to me were
beginning to go into sleep with deep affection in their hearts for
that Robert Carruthers whom wicked Roberta, Marquise of Grez and
Bye, was about to steal from them. I wept as I turned my Cherry
through the back street and into the garage of my Uncle, the
General Robert. Then I paused. All was quiet in the house and no
light burned in the apartments of my beloved protector and
relative. From the watch at my wrist I ascertained the hour to be
half after ten o&rsquo;clock, and I knew that he was safely in
cards at that Club of Old Hickory, whose lists now bore the added
one of another Robert Carruthers, man of honor and descendant of
its founders. Also there was no light in the rear of the house in
the apartment of that kind Kizzie, in whose affections I had made a
large place. A dim light burned in the hall and I knew that there I
would find my faithful chocolate Bonbon sitting upon a chair by the
great door in a deep sleep. And in a very few minutes I so found
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hello there, good Bonbon,&rdquo; I greeted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Mr. Robert,&rdquo; he answered me by a very large
smile with very white teeth set in his face of extreme blackness.
&ldquo;The Gen&rsquo;l said to call him on the &lsquo;fome as soon
as you come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will attend to from my apartment,&rdquo; I
answered him and then ascended the wide dark stairway with feet
which were as a weight to my ankles.</p>
<p>Very slowly I entered that apartment and turned on the bright
light. All was in readiness for me, and on the small table under
the glass case that contained that beflowered robe of state of the
dead Grandmamma Carruthers stood a vase of very fresh and innocent
young roses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would that I could remain and fulfill the destiny of a
woman of your house, Madam Grandmamma,&rdquo; I whispered to her
lovely and smiling portrait on the wall opposite. &ldquo;I am the
last of the ladies Carruthers but I have made a forfeit of that
destiny and I must go out in the night again in man&rsquo;s attire
to a death that will tear asunder the tender flesh that you have
borne. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I made a commencement of a very rapid packing, in one of
those bags which I had purchased from the kind gentleman in the
City of New York, of what raiment I knew would be suitable for a
man in very hurried traveling. I put into it the two suits of
clothing for wear in the daytime, but I discarded all of my
clothing for the pursuits of pleasure. The bag was at that moment
full and I did not know that it could be closed. Then I bethought
me of that brown coat that had upon it the blood which I had been
allowed to shed for my beloved Gouverneur Faulkner who was now lost
to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will take and discard the night raiment, to sleep
&lsquo;as is&rsquo; in the manner spoken of by my friend, that Mr.
G. Slade of Detroit,&rdquo; I counseled myself as I laid aside the
silken garments that I did so like and placed in their stead the
bloody coat of many wrinkles.</p>
<p>After all of that was accomplished I went into a hot bath and
again quickly began to assume my man&rsquo;s clothing, while from
my eyes dripped the slow tears that bleed from the heart of a
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must make a great hurry, thief Roberta, for it draws
near midnight and that is the hour that the train departs to the
North,&rdquo; I cautioned my weeping self. &ldquo;At that hour you
go forth into the world alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then what ensued?</p>
<p>Very suddenly I heard the noise of a car being drawn to the curb
in front of the house and the rapid steps of a man progress along
the pavings of brick to the front door, at which he made a loud
ringing. In not a moment was the good Bonbon at my door with a
knocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Governor is here to see you, Mr. Robert,&rdquo; he
informed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall you do, Roberta, Marquise of Grez and
Bye?&rdquo; I asked of myself. &ldquo;How is it that you can be
able to support the cold reproaches he will give to you while
requiring that you stay to bring dishonor to your Uncle, the
General Robert? You are caught in a trap as is an
animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then as I cowered there in my agony, very suddenly that
terrible daredevil rose within me and gave to me a very strange
counsel. As it was speaking to me my gaze was fixed upon the robe
of state of the beautiful Grandmamma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, that great Gouverneur Faulkner can give
his chastisement and lay his commands upon the beautiful and wicked
Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, in proper person, and not have
the privilege of again addressing his faithful and devoted comrade
Robert, who is dead. I, the Marquise Roberta of Grez and Bye, will
accord to him an interview and in the language of this United
States it will be &lsquo;some&rsquo; interview!&rdquo; With which
resolve I turned to make an answer to the faithful Bonbon at the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where awaits His Excellency, the Gouverneur
Faulkner?&rdquo; I questioned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hall at the bottom of the steps,&rdquo; he made
reply to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attend him into the large drawing room for a waiting and
make all of the lights to burn. Say to him that I will descend in a
very small space of time,&rdquo; I commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he made reply and departed.</p>

<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>And then in my wickedness I began to commit a desecration on the
memory of my beautiful and honored Grandmamma Carruthers. I walked
to that glass case in which reposed that gown of the beautiful
flowered silk and took it therefrom and laid it upon a chair above
the soiled riding breeches of corduroy I had so lately discarded. I
opened the carved wooden box on the table underneath and took from
it the silver slippers and the stockings of silk, also the lace fan
and the silver band for the hair. Thereupon I walked to my mirror
and commenced to make a toilet of great care but of a great
rapidity.</p>
<p>My first action was to take down that lovelock and with the oil
of roses to lay it in its accustomed place upon my cheek, which
burned with a beautiful rose of shame and at the same moment with
some other emotion that I did not understand; which emotion also
made my eyes as bright as the night stars out in that Camp Heaven.
The silver band held closely the rest of my mop and gave it the
appearance of the very close coiffure which is the fashion of this
day, and one very sweet young rose I put into it just above the
curl with an effect of great and wicked beauty.</p>
<p>The coiffure having been accomplished, the rest of the toilet,
from the slippers of the cloth of silver to the edge of fine old
lace, now the color of rich cream, that rested upon the arch of my
bare white breast was only a matter of a few moments, and then I
stood away from my mirror and beheld myself therein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are as beautiful as you are wicked, Roberta, Marquise
of Grez and Bye, but you go to your death in a manner befitting a
<em>grande dame</em> of your ancient house of France, whose
daughters once showed the rabble how to approach a guillotine,
costumed in magnificence. Descend for that cold knife to your
heart!&rdquo; And so speaking, I picked up my fan and made my way
through the hall to the halfway of the wide steps. At that point a
commotion occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lordee! It&rsquo;s the old lady come to
ha&rsquo;nt!&rdquo; exclaimed my good Bonbon and with a groan he
fled into the darkness in the back regions of the house.</p>
<p>And it happened that his loud cry brought a response which came
to me before I was quite in readiness for it. As I reached the last
step of the wide staircase, under the bright light I raised my
eyes, and behold, the Gouverneur Faulkner to whom I had descended
for the purpose of mortal combat, stood before me!</p>
<p>And was it that cruel and wicked and cold Gouverneur Faulkner
who was to scourge me and keep me in the house of my Uncle, the
General Robert, for a dishonor? It was not. Before me stood a tall
man who was of a great paleness and a terrible fatigue also,
covered with the dust of a long, hard ride, with eyes that were
full of a fear, who stood and looked at me with not one word of any
kind.</p>
<p>Suddenly I bowed my head and stretched out my bare arms, the one
of which bore the red scar from the wound suffered for him, and
thus suppliant I waited to receive the reproaches that were due to
me.</p>
<p>And for a long minute I waited and then again for another long
period of time and no word came to me. Then I raised my head!</p>
<p>For all women now in the world who have the love of a man in
their hearts, and for those unborn who will come into that
possession, I pray that they may be given the opportunity to plant
in the hearts of those men of their desire the seed of a fine
loyalty and service and comradeship, and that they may some day
look into his eyes and see that seed slowly expand into a great
white flower of mate love, as I beheld bloom for me in the eyes of
my beloved Gouverneur Faulkner. Long we stood there and looked into
the soul of each other and let the flower grow, drinking from our
hearts and the veins of our bodies until at last it was fully open;
and then I went with a love cry into his arms held out to me, and
pressed the heart of my soft woman&rsquo;s body close against his
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think my heart has always known, though my mind&rsquo;s
eyes were blind. God, if I had lost you into that hell of war, you
daredevil!&rdquo; he whispered and I tasted the salt of his tears
on my lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a lie,&rdquo; I whispered back to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are&mdash;myself,&rdquo; he laughed through a sob,
and then, while with his large warm hand he held my throat as a
person does the stem of a flower, he pressed his lips into mine
until they reached to the heart within me. In a moment with my
hands I held him back from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go, my beloved, even as I have said,&rdquo; I
cried to him. &ldquo;I cannot stay to my dishonor and to the rage
and unhappiness my Uncle, the General Robert, will experience when
he discovers that a girl has cheated him in his great affection and
generosity to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> going to be hard on the General to have
his grandmother come to life on his hands like this,&rdquo; laughed
my Gouverneur Faulkner, bending and placing upon the creamy lace of
my Grandmamma a kiss which was warm to my heart through the
beflowered silk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me die in those trenches so that he will never
know,&rdquo; I pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sweetheart, that would be too easy. You are going to
stay right here and face the old Forty-Two Centimeter,&rdquo; he
made a reply to my pleading request as he bent and laid his cheek
upon the lovelock. &ldquo;That curl ought to have opened my eyes
when I sat and watched you open yours day before yesterday
morning,&rdquo; was the remark he added to his cruel command that I
stay and face my very dreadful and so very much beloved Uncle, the
General Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; I answered as I clung to him with a
trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you are afraid of him&mdash;or
anything,&rdquo; laughed my beloved Gouverneur Faulkner with a
shake of my bare shoulders under his strong hands. &ldquo;But
perhaps these papers I have in my pocket from Captain Lasselles,
who is at the Mansion getting rid of dust, will help you out after
the first explosion, which you will have to stand in a very few
minutes from now, if that hall clock is correct and I know the
General&rsquo;s habits as I think I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let me ascend and get once again into my
trousers!&rdquo; I exclaimed as I sought to leave the arms that
again held me close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said my Gouverneur Faulkner after another
kiss upon the lace on my breast. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just wear this
ball gown until you can get some dimity, Madam, and don&rsquo;t you
ever even mention to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just here an interruption arrived, and I sprang from the
arms of my Gouverneur Faulkner only in time to avoid being
discovered therein. My beloved Uncle, the General Robert, entered
the door in a great hurry, with that much frightened Bonbon
following close at his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this that fool nigger phoned about
ghosts walking and&mdash;&rdquo; Then he stood very still in the
spot upon which his feet were placed and regarded me as I turned
from the arms of my Gouverneur Faulkner and faced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, Governor, what has happened to my boy?&rdquo; he
asked, and his fine old face was of a great whiteness and
trembling. &ldquo;Sam says he&rsquo;s dead and the
ghost&mdash;&rdquo; and then came another pause in which all of the
persons present held for a long minute their breath.</p>
<p>Did I make excuses and explanations and pleadings to my beloved
Uncle, the General Robert, in such suffering over the death of that
Robert? I did not. I opened my strong young arms wide and took him
into them with a tenderness of such great force that it would of a
necessity go into his very heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a wicked girl who has come to you in lies as a boy,
my Uncle Robert, but I have a love that is so great for you that I
will be in death if you do not accept of it from me,&rdquo; I said
as I pressed my cheek in its tears against his.</p>
<p>And for still another long minute all of the persons present
waited again and I forced to remain in my throat a sob, while my
beloved Gouverneur Faulkner laid one of his hands on the shoulder
of my Uncle, the General Robert.</p>
<p>And then did come that explosion!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young limb of Satan, you! I could shake the life out
of you if I didn&rsquo;t prefer a live girl to a dead boy. I knew
just such a thing as this would happen to me in my old age for a
long life of cussedness. And what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll wager
I&rsquo;ll never be able to give a great husky thing like you away.
You cost as much to feed as a man. Who&rsquo;d want you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even as he stormed at me I felt his strong old arms cease
from their tremblings and clasp me with a very rough
tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, General,&rdquo; said my Gouverneur Faulkner as he
attempted to take me from that very rough embrace of my Uncle, the
General Robert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take her off your
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I never ask personal favors of my
friends,&rdquo; answered my Uncle, the General Robert, as he held
me away from the arms of the Gouverneur Faulkner with a very great
determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Carruthers,&rdquo; then said my beloved
Gouverneur Faulkner as he drew his beautiful body to all the height
that was possible to him, and looked into the eyes of my beloved
Uncle Robert with his own, which are stars of the dawn, so that all
of his heart and soul and honor shone therefrom in a radiance,
&ldquo;the Marquise of Grez and Bye went a three days&rsquo;
journey into the wilds of the Harpeth mountains with me to rescue
my honor and for the welfare of this great State and of France. And
because we thought not of ourselves but of the welfare of Harpeth
and of France, and did but what was necessary as two comrades, God
has revealed to us his gift of gifts&mdash;love. As you see, she is
returned to you radiant and unharmed. Have I your consent to try to
win her hand in marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For no more than a long minute my Uncle, the General Robert,
gazed straight into the eyes of my beloved Gouverneur Faulkner, and
then a very beautiful smile did break from under those white swords
crossed above his lips, as he spoke with a great urgency:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to take the baggage along with you
to-night, Governor? Don&rsquo;t leave her here. I don&rsquo;t want
a woman about my house. I can wake up the county court clerk for a
license,&rdquo; he said with a fine twinkling of the eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but all friends must forgive me my deception; and
then must not a courtship of great decorum be made from my
Gouverneur Faulkner for the hand of the lady whom he would make his
wife?&rdquo; I asked with an uncertainty as I looked from my Uncle,
the General Robert, to my Gouverneur Faulkner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir, but I think the Marquise is right
and under the circumstances I&rsquo;ll have to make a very public
courtship, which out of consideration for you I&rsquo;ll make as
ardent and rapid as possible. Only we three know the wonderful
truth and we&rsquo;ll keep it to ourselves.&rdquo; And as he spoke
that great Gouverneur Faulkner bent and laid a kiss of great
ceremony upon the hand of Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir, I&rsquo;ll keep her for a few days and
have her fitted out in a lot of folderols for you, but only for a
short period, mind you. A very short period!&rdquo; answered my
Uncle, the General Robert, with a smile that showed much delight in
me. I flew to him and gave to him an embrace with my arms and also
laid my cheek against his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am for always your most humble and obedient girl, my
Uncle Robert,&rdquo; I whispered to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humble and obedient&mdash;no woman would know those words
if she met them in her own drawing-room,&rdquo; he answered to me
with a great scorn but he also gave to me a shake that was of a
seeming great fierceness, but that I knew to be a caress.</p>
<p>And into that caress came also another interruption of great
hurry. My Buzz entered the door with a rapidity and this
exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, General? I just got your phone
and&mdash;&rdquo; Then he too stood in a great and sudden
stillness, regarding me as I stood from the shelter of the arms of
my Uncle, the General Robert, and looked into his eyes of great
fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Buzz,&rdquo; I said to him softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with terror in his
eyes as he backed away from me. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had but one
glass of draft beer, General.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Buzz,&rdquo; answered my very wise
Gouverneur Faulkner, in a voice of great soothing. &ldquo;This is
just&mdash;just Robert in a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much Bobby, that,&rdquo; answered my Buzz as he
backed farther towards the door. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll step
outside in the cool air. I haven&rsquo;t felt well all day.
I&mdash;&rdquo; and with which remark my good Buzz turned himself
into the arms of the lovely Mademoiselle Sue entering the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of waiting out there in that car, Buzz,
and&mdash;&rdquo; And again came an awful pause of terror. But is
it not that women have a wit that is very much more rapid than is
that of men? I think it is so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I thought Bobby was a queer kind of man and he
is a perfectly lovely girl,&rdquo; she said as she came towards me
with a laugh and her lovely arms outstretched. &ldquo;I read about
two French girls who got into Germany in German uniforms, just last
night in a magazine. You are some kind of a French spy about those
dreadful mules, aren&rsquo;t you, Bobby dear?&rdquo; And as she
asked that question of me, my lovely Sue gave to me a kiss upon my
lips that I valued with a great gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please make it that my Buzz also understands,&rdquo; I
pleaded to her within her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, Buzz, and be nice to Bobby, even if he is a
girl. Just when did you begin not to like girls, I&rsquo;d like to
know?&rdquo; questioned my Sue of him with a great emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see why it is that I cannot go into that business of
timber with you and be married to&mdash;&rdquo; I made a
commencement to say to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, L&rsquo;Aiglon,&rdquo; interrupted my Buzz
with a great haste and a glance in the direction of lovely Sue.
&ldquo;Forget it! It is an awful shame, for you were one nice
youngster and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a sport, Buzz, and forgive her and&mdash;love her
again,&rdquo; said my Gouverneur Faulkner with a laugh. &ldquo;That
is, as much as Miss Susan will&mdash;&rdquo; But at this point my
Uncle, the General Robert, caused an interruption in the
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, sir, when I left you to watch
the side-steps of that French popinjay and the Whitworth woman? Did
you hear what all that powwow was about at her tea fight this
afternoon?&rdquo; he demanded of fine Buzz, with a great anxiety.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been hell to pay, since you left, Governor,
and I think this French scoundrel and Jeff&rsquo;s gang are
preparing to put through some sort of a private steal if you jump
the track on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam Pat has got &rsquo;em all up at the Club, plotting
in a corner at the little dinner dance we got up when his
High-and-Mightiness refused the rural expedition, as soon as they
heard you were not to go, Governor,&rdquo; said my Buzz with a
great anxiety in his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see anybody put
out Mrs. Pat&rsquo;s light when she is once lit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Buzz, and don&rsquo;t worry.
Something has arrived to stop it all. It&rsquo;s up at the Mansion
now and is man-sized,&rdquo; answered my beloved Gouverneur
Faulkner with a great soothing.</p>
<p>And after that remark there were many very long explanations
that made a beginning about the crooked back of the wee Pierre,
which, in a letter come to my Uncle, the General Robert, that day,
was declared by that great Doctor Burns to be of a certainty
straight within the year, and that ended in the library where my
Uncle, the General Robert, and my Gouverneur Faulkner, with good
Buzz, read and read yet again the papers that my great Capitaine,
the Count de Lasselles, had signed for an honest delivery of the
many mules to France. I do not know all that my beloved Gouverneur
Faulkner said to my Uncle, the General Robert, for I remained in
the hall with my Sue in a discussion about the telling without
offense of the departure of Robert Carruthers to my Belle and other
loved ones. And to us soon returned my Buzz of great curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no humbleness that I will not perform for their
forgiveness, my Buzz and my Sue,&rdquo; I said to them. &ldquo;Seek
that they grant it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will be so exciting and up-to-date with its spy
and war flavor that everybody will forgive you. You are a lovely
darling and they&rsquo;ll all be glad you are a girl&mdash;all the
boys especially,&rdquo; said to me my Sue, with a defiance at my
Buzz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Bobbyette, I&rsquo;ll see that you&rsquo;re no
wall-flower,&rdquo; he made answer to her in the person of me, with
a return of that defiance. &ldquo;Come on, Susan, let me take you
home. Good night, old top&mdash;no, I mean <em>belle
Marquise</em>&rdquo; and it was a very funny thing to see that Buzz
with a great awkwardness, bend and kiss my hand at a laugh from my
Sue as they left me.</p>
<p>It was not for many moments that I stood alone in the hall after
the departure of my Sue and my Buzz, before there entered my
beloved Uncle, the General Robert, and also my beloved Gouverneur
Faulkner, who came to stand, one upon the one side of me and one
upon the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you wouldn&rsquo;t like to take her along with you
to-night, Governor?&rdquo; again asked my Uncle, the General
Robert, with a great fierceness but also a twinkling of the
eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only as far as your garden for a few minutes,
General,&rdquo; answered my Gouverneur Faulkner with that laugh of
a boy I had remarked once before up in those mountains of Old
Harpeth, and he took my hand in his as if to lead me through one of
the tall windows out into the fragrant night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, take her and don&rsquo;t return her until you
have to,&rdquo; remarked my Uncle, the General Robert, as he handed
me in the direction of my Gouverneur Faulkner and immediately took
his departure up the stairs.</p>
<p>And it was under the light of the old moon, in the garden of
those <em>grande dames</em> Carruthers, that Roberta, Marquise of
Grez and Bye, who is the last of their line, walked with the great
gentleman who was and is her lover. Is it that those beautiful dead
Grandmammas each planted her flowers in her own great happiness so
that they would give forth a very tender perfume in which to enfold
the wooings of their daughters then not come into the world? I
think it is so, and I was thus enwrapped in their fragrance as I
was in the arms of that great Gouverneur Faulkner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am a truth that I do love you,&rdquo; I made answer
to a question that was pressed upon my lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His woman is God&rsquo;s gift of truth to a man,&rdquo;
were the words that were heard by those listening flowers and
Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, who from a world at war had come
home.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
