				<p>
				<span class="largecap">T</span>he Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea<br />
				<span class="i4">In a beautiful pea-green boat:</span>
				They took some honey, and plenty of money<br />
				<span class="i2">Wrapped up in a five-pound note.</span>
				The Owl looked up to the stars above,<br />
				<span class="i2">And sang to a small guitar,</span>
				"O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,<br />
				<span class="i2">What a beautiful Pussy you are,</span>
				<span class="i6">You are,</span>
				<span class="i6">You are!</span>

				<a class="pagenumber" name="page090" id="page090" title="090"></a>
				</p>
				<p class="versenumber">II.</p>
				<p>
				Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl,<br />
				<span class="i2">How charmingly sweet you sing!</span>
				Oh! let us be married; too long we have tarried:<br />
				<span class="i2">But what shall we do for a ring?"</span>
				They sailed away, for a year and a day,<br />
				<span class="i2">To the land where the bong-tree grows;</span>
				And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,<br />
				<span class="i2">With a ring at the end of his nose,</span>
				<span class="i6">His nose,</span>
				<span class="i6">His nose,</span>
				<span class="i2">With a ring at the end of his nose.</span>
				</p>
				<img src="images/118.gif" alt="The Owl and the Pussy-cat" />
				<p class="versenumber">III.</p>
				<p>
				"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling<br />
				<span class="i2">Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I will."</span>
				So they took it away, and were married next day<br />
				<span class="i2">By the Turkey who lives on the hill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page091" id="page091" title="091"></a>
				They dined on mince and slices of quince,<br />
				<span class="i2">Which they ate with a runcible spoon;</span>
				And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,<br />
				<span class="i2">They danced by the light of the moon,</span>
				<span class="i4">The moon,</span>
				<span class="i4">The moon,</span>

				<span class="i2">"Good gracious! how you hop</span>
				Over the fields, and the water too,<br />
				<span class="i2">As if you never would stop!</span>
				My life is a bore in this nasty pond;<br />
				And I long to go out in the world beyond:<br />
				<span class="i2">I wish I could hop like you,"</span>

				<p class="versenumber">II.</p>
				<p>
				"Please give me a ride on your back,"<br />
				<span class="i2">Said the Duck to the Kangaroo:</span>

				<span class="i2">The whole of the long day through;</span>
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page093" id="page093" title="093"></a>
				And we 'd go the Dee, and the Jelly Bo Lee,<br />
				Over the land, and over the sea:<br />
				<span class="i2">Please take me a ride! oh, do!"</span>
				<span class="i2">Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.</span>

				<img src="images/121.gif" alt="The Duck and the Kangaroo" />
				<p class="versenumber">
				III.<br />
				</p>
				<p>
				Said the Kangaroo to the Duck,<br />
				<span class="i2">"This requires some little reflection.</span>
				Perhaps, on the whole, it might bring me luck;<br />
				<span class="i2">And there seems but one objection;</span>
				Which is, if you'll let me speak so bold,<br />
				Your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold,<br />
				<span class="i2">And would probably give me the roo-</span>
				<span class="i2">Matiz," said the Kangaroo.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page094" id="page094" title="094"></a>
				</p>
				<p class="versenumber">IV.</p>
				<p>
				Said the Duck, "As I sate on the rocks,<br />
				<span class="i2">I have thought over that completely;</span>
				And I bought four pairs of worsted socks,<br />
				<span class="i2">Which fit my web-feet neatly;</span>
				And, to keep out the cold, I've bought a cloak;<br />
				And every day a cigar I'll smoke;<br />
				<span class="i2">All to follow my own dear true</span>
				<span class="i2">Love of a Kangaroo."</span>
				</p>
				<p class="versenumber">V.</p>
				<p>
				Said the Kangaroo, "I'm ready,<br />
				<span class="i2">All in the moonlight pale;</span>
				But to balance me well, dear Duck, sit steady,<br />
				<span class="i2">And quite at the end of my tail."</span>

				<img src="images/122.gif" alt="The Duck and the Kangaroo" />
				<p>
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page095" id="page095" title="095"></a>
				So away they went with a hop and a bound;<br />
				And they hopped the whole world three times round.<br />
				<span class="i2">And who so happy, oh! who,</span>
				<span class="i2">As the Duck and the Kangaroo?</span>

				<p class="versenumber">I.</p>
				<p>
				<span class="largecap">O</span>nce Mr. Daddy Long-legs,<br />
				<span class="i2">Dressed in brown and gray,</span>
				Walked about upon the sands<br />
				<span class="i2">Upon a summer's day:</span>
				And there among the pebbles,<br />
				<span class="i2">When the wind was rather cold,</span>
				He met with Mr. Floppy Fly,<br />
				<span class="i2">All dressed in blue and gold;</span>
				And, as it was too soon to dine,<br />
				They drank some periwinkle-wine,<br />
				And played an hour or two, or more,<br />
				At battlecock and shuttledore.<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page097" id="page097" title="097"></a>
				</p>
				<p class="versenumber">II.</p>
				<p>
				Said Mr. Daddy Long-legs<br />
				<span class="i4">To Mr. Floppy Fly,</span>
				"Why do you never come to court?<br />
				<span class="i4">I wish you 'd tell me why.</span>
				All gold and shine, in dress so fine,<br />
				<span class="i4">You'd quite delight the court.</span>
				Why do you never go at all?<br />
				<span class="i4">I really think you <i>ought</i>.</span>
				And, if you went, you'd see such sights!<br />
				Such rugs and jugs and candle-lights!<br />
				And, more than all, the king and queen,&#8212;<br />
				One in red, and one in green."<br />
				</p>
				<p class="versenumber">III.</p>
				<p>
				"O Mr. Daddy Long-legs!"<br />
				<span class="i4">Said Mr. Floppy Fly,</span>
				"It's true I never go to court;<br />
				<span class="i4">And I will tell you why.</span>
				If I had six long legs like yours,<br />
				<span class="i4">At once I'd go to court;</span>
				But, oh! I can't, because <i>my</i> legs<br />
				<span class="i4">Are so extremely short.</span>
				And I'm afraid the king and queen<br />
				(One in red, and one in green)<br />
				Would say aloud, 'You are not fit,<br />
				You Fly, to come to court a bit!'"<br />
				</p>
				<p class="versenumber">IV.</p>
				<p>
				"Oh, Mr. Daddy Long-legs!"<br />
				<span class="i4">Said Mr. Floppy Fly,</span>
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page098" id="page098" title="098"></a>
				"I wish you 'd sing one little song,<br />
				<span class="i2">One mumbian melody.</span>
				You used to sing so awful well<br />
				<span class="i2">In former days gone by;</span>
				But now you never sing at all:<br />
				<span class="i2">I wish you'd tell me why:</span>
				For, if you would, the silvery sound<br />
				Would please the shrimps and cockles round,<br />
				And all the crabs would gladly come<br />
				To hear you sing, 'Ah, Hum di Hum!'"<br />
				</p>
				<p class="versenumber">V.</p>
				<p>
				Said Mr. Daddy Long-legs,<br />
				<span class="i2">"I can never sing again;</span>
				And, if you wish, I'll tell you why,<br />
				<span class="i2">Although it gives me pain.</span>
				For years I cannot hum a bit,<br />
				<span class="i2">Or sing the smallest song;</span>
				And this the dreadful reason is,&#8212;<br />
				<span class="i2">My legs are grown too long!</span>
				My six long legs, all here and there,<br />
				Oppress my bosom with despair;<br />
				And, if I stand or lie or sit,<br />
				I cannot sing one single bit!"<br />
				</p>
				<p class="versenumber">VI.</p>
				<p>
				So Mr. Daddy Long-legs<br />
				<span class="i2">And Mr. Floppy Fly</span>
				Sat down in silence by the sea,<br />
				<span class="i2">And gazed upon the sky.</span>
				They said, "This is a dreadful thing!<br />
				<span class="i2">The world has all gone wrong,</span>
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page099" id="page099" title="099"></a>
				Since one has legs too short by half,<br />
				<span class="i2">The other much too long.</span>
				One never more can go to court,<br />
				Because his legs have grown too short;<br />
				The other cannot sing a song,<br />
				Because his legs have grown too long!"
				</p>
				<p class="versenumber">VII.</p>
				<p>
				Then Mr. Daddy Long-legs<br />
				<span class="i2">And Mr. Floppy Fly</span>
				Rushed downward to the foamy sea<br />
				<span class="i2">With one sponge-taneous cry:</span>
				And there they found a little boat,<br />
				<span class="i2">Whose sails were pink and gray;</span>
				And off they sailed among the waves,<br />
				<span class="i2">Far and far away:</span>
				They sailed across the silent main,<br />
				And reached the great Gromboolian Plain;<br />
				And there they play forevermore<br />
				At battlecock and shuttledore.<br />

				<span class="i2">In a sieve they went to sea:</span>
				In spite of all their friends could say,<br />
				On a winter's morn, on a stormy day,<br />
				<span class="i2">In a sieve they went to sea.</span>
				And when the sieve turned round and round,<br />
				And every one cried, "You'll all be drowned!"<br />
				They called aloud, "Our sieve ain't big;<br />
				But we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:<br />
				<span class="i2">In a sieve we'll go to sea!"</span>
				<span class="i6">Far and few, far and few,</span>

				<span class="i6">Their heads are green, and their hands are blue</span>
				<span class="i8">And they went to sea in a sieve.</span>

				<p class="versenumber">II.</p>
				<p>
				They sailed away in a sieve, they did,<br />
				<span class="i2">In a sieve they sailed so fast,</span>
				With only a beautiful pea-green veil<br />
				Tied with a ribbon, by way of a sail,<br />
				<span class="i2">To a small tobacco-pipe mast.</span>
				And every one said who saw them go,<br />
				"Oh! won't they be soon upset, you know?<br />
				For the sky is dark, and the voyage is long;<br />
				And, happen what may, it's extremely wrong<br />
				<span class="i2">In a sieve to sail so fast."</span>
				<span class="i4">Far and few, far and few,</span>
				<span class="i6">Are the lands where the Jumblies live:</span>

				<p class="versenumber">III.</p>
				<p>
				The water it soon came in, it did;<br />
				<span class="i2">The water it soon came in:</span>
				So, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet<br />
				In a pinky paper all folded neat;<br />
				<span class="i2">And they fastened it down with a pin.</span>
				And they passed the night in a crockery-jar;<br />
				And each of them said, "How wise we are!<br />
				Though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,<br />
				Yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,<br />
				<span class="i2">While round in our sieve we spin."</span>
				<span class="i4">Far and few, far and few,</span>
				<span class="i6">Are the lands where the Jumblies live:</span>
				<span class="i4">Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;</span>

				<p>
				And all night long they sailed away;<br />
				<span class="i2">And when the sun went down,</span>

				<span class="i2">So idle and weary, so full of remorse,</span>

					<h3>THE STORY OF THE FOUR LITTLE CHILDREN WHO WENT ROUND THE WORLD.</h3>
					<p>
					Once upon a time, a long while ago, there were four little
					people whose names were<br />
					<br />
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/139.gif" alt="Violet, Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel;" />
					<br />
					and they all thought they should like to see the world. So they
					bought a large boat to sail quite round the world by sea, and then
					they were to come back on the other side by land. The boat was
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page122" id="page122" title="122"></a>
					painted blue with green spots, and the sail was yellow with red
					stripes: and, when they set off, they only took a small Cat to steer
					and look after the boat, besides an elderly Quangle-Wangle, who
					had to cook the dinner and make the tea; for which purposes they
					took a large kettle.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/140.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					For the first ten days they sailed on beautifully, and found plenty
					to eat, as there were lots of fish; and they had only to take them
					out of the sea with a long spoon, when the Quangle-Wangle instantly
					cooked them; and the Pussy-Cat was fed with the bones,
					with which she expressed herself pleased, on the whole: so that all
					the party were very happy.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/141.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page123" id="page123" title="123"></a>
					<p>
					During the daytime, Violet chiefly occupied herself in putting
					salt water into a churn; while her three brothers churned it violently,
					in the hope that it would turn into butter, which it seldom
					if ever did; and in the evening they all retired into the tea-kettle,
					where they all managed to sleep very comfortably, while Pussy and
					the Quangle-Wangle managed the boat.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/142.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					After a time, they saw some land at a distance; and, when they
					came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded
					by earth. Besides that, it was bordered by evanescent
					isthmuses, with a great gulf-stream running about all over it; so
					that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree,
					503 feet high.
					</p>
					<p>
					<img src="images/143.gif" align="left" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." /><br />
					When they had landed, they walked about, but found, to their
					great surprise, that the island was quite full of veal-cutlets and
					chocolate-drops, and nothing else. So they all climbed up the
					single high tree to discover, if possible, if there were any people;
					but having remained on the top of the tree for a week, and not
					seeing anybody, they naturally concluded that there were no inhabitants;
					and accordingly, when they came down, they loaded
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page124" id="page124" title="124"></a>
					the boat with two thousand veal-cutlets
					and a million of chocolate-drops;
					and these afforded
					them sustenance for more than
					a month, during which time
					they pursued their voyage with
					the utmost delight and apathy.
					</p>
					<p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/144.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World."/><br />
					After this they came to a
					shore where there were no less than sixty-five
					great red parrots with blue tails, sitting
					on a rail all of a row, and all fast asleep.
					And I am sorry to say that the Pussy-Cat
					and the Quangle-Wangle crept softly, and
					bit off the tail-feathers of all the sixty-five
					parrots; for which Violet reproved them
					both severely.
					</p>
					<p>
					Notwithstanding which, she proceeded
					to insert all the feathers&#8212;two hundred
					and sixty in number&#8212;in her bonnet;
					thereby causing it to have a lovely and
					glittering appearance, highly prepossessing
					and efficacious.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/145.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					The next thing that happened to them
					was in a narrow part of the sea, which was
					so entirely full of fishes that the boat could
					go on no farther: so they remained there
					about six weeks, till they had eaten nearly
					all the fishes, which were soles, and all
					ready-cooked, and covered with shrimp-sauce,
					so that there was no trouble whatever.
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page125" id="page125" title="125"></a>
					</p>
					<p>
					And as the few fishes who remained uneaten complained of
					the cold, as well as of the difficulty they had in getting any sleep on
					account of the extreme noise made by the arctic bears and the tropical
					turnspits, which frequented the neighborhood in great numbers,
					Violet most amiably knitted a small woollen frock for several of
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page126" id="page126" title="126"></a>
					the fishes, and Slingsby administered some opium-drops to them;
					through which kindness they became quite warm, and slept soundly.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/146.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					Then they came to a country which was wholly covered with
					immense orange-trees of a vast size, and quite full of fruit. So they
					all landed, taking with them the tea-kettle, intending to gather some
					of the oranges, and place them in it. But, while they were busy
					about this, a most dreadfully high wind rose, and blew out most of
					the parrot-tail feathers from Violet's bonnet. That, however, was
					nothing compared with the calamity of the oranges falling down on
					their heads by millions and millions, which thumped and bumped
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page127" id="page127" title="127"></a>
					and bumped and thumped them all so seriously, that they were
					obliged to run as hard as they could for their lives; besides that
					the sound of the oranges rattling on the tea-kettle was of the most
					fearful and amazing nature.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/147.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					Nevertheless, they got safely to the boat, although considerably
					vexed and hurt; and the Quangle-Wangle's right foot was so
					knocked about, that he had to sit with his head in his slipper for
					at least a week.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/148.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." /><br />
					<p>
					This event made them all for a time rather melancholy: and perhaps
					they might never have become less so, had not Lionel, with a
					most praiseworthy devotion and perseverance, continued to stand
					on one leg,<br />
					and whistle to them in a loud and lively manner; which
					diverted the whole party so extremely
					that they gradually recovered
					their spirits, and agreed
					that whenever they should reach
					home, they would subscribe towards
					a testimonial to Lionel, entirely
					made of gingerbread and
					raspberries, as an earnest token of
					their sincere and grateful infection.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/149.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />

					<p>
					After sailing on calmly for
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page128" id="page128" title="128"></a>
					several more days, they came to another country, where they were
					much pleased and surprised to see a countless multitude of white
					Mice with red eyes, all sitting in a great circle, slowly eating
					custard-pudding with the most satisfactory and polite demeanor.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/150.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					And as the four travellers were rather hungry, being tired of eating
					nothing but soles and oranges for so long a period, they held
					a council as to the propriety of asking the Mice for some of their
					pudding in a humble and affecting manner, by which they could
					hardly be otherwise than gratified. It was agreed, therefore, that
					Guy should go and ask the Mice, which he immediately did; and
					the result was, that they gave a walnut-shell only half full of custard
					diluted with water. Now, this displeased Guy, who said, "Out of
					such a lot of pudding as you have got, I must say, you might have
					spared a somewhat larger quantity." But no sooner had he finished
					speaking than the Mice turned round at once, and sneezed at him
					in an appalling and vindictive manner (and it is impossible to
					imagine a more scroobious and unpleasant sound than that caused by
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page129" id="page129" title="129"></a>
					the simultaneous sneezing of many millions of angry Mice); so that
					Guy rushed back to the boat, having first shied his cap into the
					middle of the custard-pudding, by which means he completely
					spoiled the Mice's dinner.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/151.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					By and by the four children came to a country where there were
					no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large
					bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue
					color. Each of these blue bottles contained a Blue-Bottle-Fly; and
					all these interesting animals live continually together in the most
					copious and rural harmony: nor perhaps in many parts of the world
					is such perfect and abject happiness to be found. Violet and
					Slingsby and Guy and Lionel were greatly struck with this singular
					and instructive settlement; and, having previously asked permission
					of the Blue-Bottle-Flies (which was most courteously granted), the
					boat was drawn up to the shore, and they proceeded to make tea in
					front of the bottles: but as they had no tea-leaves, they merely
					placed some pebbles in the hot water; and the Quangle-Wangle
					played some tunes over it on an accordion, by which, of course, tea
					was made directly, and of the very best quality.
					</p>
				<img class="centeredimage" src="images/152.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					The four children then entered into conversation with the Blue-Bottle-Flies,
					who discoursed in a placid and genteel manner, though
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page130" id="page130" title="130"></a>
					with a slightly buzzing accent, chiefly owing to the fact that they
					each held a small clothes-brush between their teeth, which naturally
					occasioned a fizzy, extraneous utterance.
					</p>
					<p>
					"Why," said Violet, "would you kindly inform us, do you reside
					in bottles; and, if in bottles at all, why not, rather, in green or purple,
					or, indeed, in yellow bottles?"
					</p>
					<p>
					To which questions a very aged Blue-Bottle-Fly answered, "We
					found the bottles here all ready to live in; that is to say, our
					great-great-great-great-great-grandfathers did: so we occupied them at
					once. And, when the winter comes on, we turn the bottles upside
					down, and consequently rarely feel the cold at all; and you know
					very well that this could not be the case with bottles of any other
					color than blue."
					</p>
					<p>
					"Of course it could not," said Slingsby. "But, if we may take
					the liberty of inquiring, on what do you chiefly subsist?"
					</p>
					<p>
					"Mainly on oyster-patties," said the Blue-Bottle-Fly; "and,
					when these are scarce, on raspberry vinegar and Russian leather
					boiled down to a jelly."
					</p>
					<p>
					"How delicious!" said Guy.
					</p>
					<p>
					To which Lionel added, "Huzz!" And all the Blue-Bottle-Flies
					said, "Buzz!"
					</p>
					<p>
					At this time, an elderly Fly said it was the hour for the evening-song
					to be sung; and, on a signal being given, all the Blue-Bottle-Flies
					began to buzz at once in a sumptuous and sonorous manner,
					the melodious and mucilaginous sounds echoing all over the waters,
					and resounding across the tumultuous tops of the transitory titmice
					upon the intervening and verdant mountains with a serene and
					sickly suavity only known to the truly virtuous. The Moon was
					shining slobaciously from the star-bespangled sky, while her light
					irrigated the smooth and shiny sides and wings and backs of the
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page131" id="page131" title="131"></a>
					Blue-Bottle-Flies with a peculiar and trivial splendor, while all
					Nature cheerfully responded to the cerulean and conspicuous
					circumstances.
					</p>
					<p>
					In many long-after years, the four little travellers looked back to
					that evening as one of the happiest in all their lives; and it was
					already past midnight when&#8212;the sail of the boat having been set
					up by the Quangle-Wangle, the tea-kettle and churn placed in their
					respective positions, and the Pussy-Cat stationed at the helm&#8212;the
					children each took a last and affectionate farewell of the Blue-Bottle-Flies,
					who walked down in a body to the water's edge to see the
					travellers embark.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/153.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					As a token of parting respect and esteem, Violet made a courtesy
					quite down to the ground, and stuck one of her few remaining
					parrot-tail feathers into the back hair of the most pleasing of the
					Blue-Bottle-Flies; while Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel offered them
					three small boxes, containing, respectively, black pins, dried figs,
					and Epsom salts; and thus they left that happy shore forever.
					</p>
					<p>
					Overcome by their feelings, the four little travellers instantly
					jumped into the tea-kettle, and fell fast asleep. But all along
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page132" id="page132" title="132"></a>
					the shore, for many hours, there was distinctly heard a sound of
					severely-suppressed sobs, and of a vague multitude of living creatures
					using their pocket-handkerchiefs in a subdued simultaneous
					snuffle, lingering sadly along the walloping waves as the boat sailed
					farther and farther away from the Land of the Happy Blue-Bottle-Flies.
					</p>
					<p>
					Nothing particular occurred for some days after these events,
					except that, as the travellers were passing a low tract of sand, they
					perceived an unusual and gratifying spectacle; namely, a large
					number of Crabs and Crawfish&#8212;perhaps six or seven hundred&#8212;sitting
					by the water-side, and endeavoring to disentangle a vast
					heap of pale pink worsted, which they moistened at intervals with
					a fluid composed of lavender-water and white-wine negus.
					</p>
					<p>
					"Can we be of any service to you, O crusty Crabbies?" said the
					four children.
					</p>
					<p>
					"Thank you kindly," said the Crabs consecutively. "We are
					trying to make some worsted mittens, but do not know how."
					</p>
					<p>
					On which Violet, who was perfectly acquainted with the art of
					mitten-making, said to the Crabs, "Do your claws unscrew, or are
					they fixtures?"
					</p>
					<p>
					"They are all made to unscrew," said the Crabs; and forthwith
					they deposited a great pile of claws close to the boat, with which
					Violet uncombed all the pale pink worsted, and then made the loveliest
					mittens with it you can imagine. These the Crabs, having
					resumed and screwed on their claws, placed cheerfully upon their
					wrists, and walked away rapidly on their hind-legs, warbling songs
					with a silvery voice and in a minor key.
					</p>
					<p>
					After this, the four little people sailed on again till they came to
					a vast and wide plain of astonishing dimensions, on which nothing
					whatever could be discovered at first; but, as the travellers walked
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page133" id="page133" title="133"></a>
					onward, there appeared in the extreme and dim distance a single
					object, which on a nearer approach, and on an accurately cutaneous
					inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig, sitting on
					an arm-chair made of sponge-cakes and oyster-shells. "It does not
					quite look like a human being," said Violet doubtfully; nor could
					they make out what it really was, till the Quangle-Wangle (who had
					previously been round the world) exclaimed softly in a loud voice,
					"It is the co-operative Cauliflower!"
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/154.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					And so, in truth, it was: and they soon found that what they had
					taken for an immense wig was in reality the top of the Cauliflower;
					and that he had no feet at all, being able to walk tolerably well with
					a fluctuating and graceful movement on a single cabbage-stalk,&#8212;an
					accomplishment which naturally saved him the expense of stockings
					and shoes.
					</p>
					<p>
					Presently, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at
					him with mingled affection and disgust, he suddenly arose, and,
					in a somewhat plumdomphious manner, hurried off towards the
					setting sun,&#8212;his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential
					Cucumbers, and a large number of Waterwagtails proceeding
					in advance of him by three and three in a row,&#8212;till he finally
					disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of
					sudorific sand.
					</p>
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page134" id="page134" title="134"></a>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/155.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					So remarkable a sight, of course, impressed the four children very
					deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong
					sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.
					</p>
					<p>
					Shortly after this, the travellers were obliged to sail directly below
					some high overhanging rocks, from the top of one of which a particularly
					odious little boy, dressed in rose-colored knickerbockers,
					and with a pewter plate upon his head, threw an enormous pumpkin
					at the boat, by which it was instantly upset.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/156.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					But this upsetting was of no consequence, because all the party
					knew how to swim very well: and, in fact, they preferred swimming
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page135" id="page135" title="135"></a>
					about till after the moon rose; when, the water growing chilly, they
					sponge-taneously entered the boat. Meanwhile the Quangle-Wangle
					threw back the pumpkin with immense force, so that it hit the rocks
					where the malicious little boy in rose-colored knickerbockers was
					sitting; when, being quite full of lucifer-matches, the pumpkin
					exploded surreptitiously into a thousand bits; whereon the rocks
					instantly took fire, and the odious little boy became unpleasantly
					hotter and hotter and hotter, till his knickerbockers were turned
					quite green, and his nose was burnt off.
					</p>
					<p>
					Two or three days after this had happened, they came to another
					place, where they found nothing at all except some wide and deep
					pits full of mulberry-jam. This is the property of the tiny, yellow-nosed
					Apes who abound in these districts, and who store up the
					mulberry-jam for their food in winter, when they mix it with pellucid
					pale periwinkle-soup, and serve it out in wedgewood china-bowls,
					which grow freely all over that part of the country. Only
					one of the yellow-nosed Apes was on the spot, and he was fast
					asleep; yet the four travellers and the Quangle-Wangle and Pussy
					were so terrified by the violence and sanguinary sound of his snoring,
					that they merely took a small cupful of the jam, and returned
					to re-embark in their boat without delay.
					</p>
					<p>
					What was their horror on seeing the boat (including the churn
					and the tea-kettle) in the mouth of an enormous Seeze Pyder, an
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page136" id="page136" title="136"></a>
					aquatic and ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and,
					happily, only met with in those excessive longitudes! In a moment,
					the beautiful boat was bitten into fifty-five thousand million hundred
					billion bits; and it instantly became quite clear that Violet, Slingsby,
					Guy, and Lionel could no longer preliminate their voyage by sea.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/157.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					The four travellers were therefore obliged to resolve on pursuing
					their wanderings by land: and, very fortunately, there happened
					to pass by at that moment an elderly Rhinoceros, on which they
					seized; and, all four mounting on his back,&#8212;the Quangle-Wangle
					sitting on his horn, and holding on by his ears, and the Pussy-Cat
					swinging at the end of his tail,&#8212;they set off, having only four small
					beans and three pounds of mashed potatoes to last through their
					whole journey.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/158.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					They were, however, able to catch numbers of the chickens and
					turkeys and other birds who incessantly alighted on the head of the
					Rhinoceros for the purpose of gathering the seeds of the rhododendron-plants which grew there; and these creatures they cooked in
					the most translucent and satisfactory manner by means of a fire
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page137" id="page137" title="137"></a>
					lighted on the end of the Rhinoceros's back. A crowd of Kangaroos
					and gigantic Cranes accompanied them, from feelings of curiosity
					and complacency; so that they were never at a loss for company,
					and went onward, as it were, in a sort of profuse and triumphant
					procession.
					</p>
					<p>
					Thus in less than eighteen weeks they all arrived safely at
					home, where they were received by their admiring relatives with
					joy tempered with contempt, and where they finally resolved to
					carry out the rest of their travelling-plans at some more favorable
					opportunity.
					</p>
					<p>
					As for the Rhinoceros, in token of their grateful adherence, they
					had him killed and stuffed directly, and then set him up outside
					the door of their father's house as a diaphanous doorscraper.

						<p>
						In former days,&#8212;that is to say, once upon a time,&#8212;there lived
						in the Land of Gramble-Blamble seven families. They lived
						by the side of the great Lake Pipple-Popple (one of the seven
						families, indeed, lived <i>in</i> the lake), and on the outskirts of the city
						of Tosh, which, excepting when it was quite dark, they could see
						plainly. The names of all these places you have probably heard
						of; and you have only not to look in your geography-books to
						find out all about them.
						</p>
						<p>
						Now, the seven families who lived on the borders of the great

						<p class="chapternumber">CHAPTER III.</p>
						<p class="chapterdescription">THE HABITS OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES.</p>
						<p>
						The Parrots lived upon the Soffsky-Poffsky trees, which were
						beautiful to behold, and covered with blue leaves; and they
						fed upon fruit, artichokes, and striped beetles.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Storks walked in and out of the Lake Pipple-Popple, and
						ate frogs for breakfast, and buttered toast for tea; but on account
						of the extreme length of their legs they could not sit down, and so
						they walked about continually.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Geese, having webs to their feet, caught quantities of flies,
						which they ate for dinner.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Owls anxiously looked after mice, which they caught, and
						made into sago-puddings.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Guinea Pigs toddled about the gardens, and ate lettuces
						and Cheshire cheese.
						</p>
						<p>
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page142" id="page142" title="142"></a>
						The Cats sate still in the sunshine, and fed upon sponge biscuits.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Fishes lived in the lake, and fed chiefly on boiled periwinkles.
						</p>
						<p>
						And all these seven families lived together in the utmost fun and

					<div class="chapter" id="pipplechapter4">
						<p class="chapternumber">CHAPTER IV.</p>
						<p class="chapterdescription">THE CHILDREN OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES ARE SENT AWAY.</p>
						<p>
						One day all the seven fathers and the seven mothers of the
						seven families agreed that they would send their children
						out to see the world.
						</p>
						<p>
						So they called them all together, and gave them each eight
						shillings and some good advice, some chocolate-drops, and a small
						green morocco pocket-book to set down their expenses in.
						</p>
						<p>
						They then particularly entreated them not to quarrel; and all
						the parents sent off their children with a parting injunction.
						</p>
						<p>
						"If," said the old Parrots, "you find a cherry, do not fight
						about who should have it."
						</p>
						<p>
						"And," said the old Storks, "if you find a frog, divide it carefully
						into seven bits, but on no account quarrel about it."
						</p>
						<p>
						And the old Geese said to the seven young Geese, "Whatever
						you do, be sure you do not touch a plum-pudding flea."
						</p>
						<p>
						And the old Owls said, "If you find a mouse, tear him up into
						seven slices, and eat him cheerfully, but without quarrelling."
						</p>
						<p>
						And the old Guinea Pigs said, "Have a care that you eat your
						lettuces, should you find any, not greedily, but calmly."
						</p>
						<p>
						And the old Cats said, "Be particularly careful not to meddle
						with a clangle-wangle if you should see one."
						</p>
						<p>
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page143" id="page143" title="143"></a>
						And the old Fishes said, "Above all things, avoid eating a blue
						boss-woss; for they do not agree with fishes, and give them a pain
						in their toes."
						</p>
						<p>
						So all the children of each family thanked their parents; and,
						making in all forty-nine polite bows, they went into the wide
						world.

						The seven young Parrots had not gone far, when they saw

						When the seven young Storks set out, they walked or flew for
						fourteen weeks in a straight line, and for six weeks more in
						a crooked one; and after that they ran as hard as they could for
						one hundred and eight miles; and after that they stood still, and
						made a himmeltanious chatter-clatter-blattery noise with their bills.
						</p>
						<p>
						About the same time they perceived a large frog, spotted with
						green, and with a sky-blue stripe under each ear.
						</p>
						<p>
						So, being hungry, they immediately flew at him, and were going
						to divide him into seven pieces, when they began to quarrel as to
						which of his legs should be taken off first. One said this, and
						another said that; and while they were all quarrelling, the frog
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page145" id="page145" title="145"></a>
						hopped away. And when they saw that he was gone, they began
						to chatter-clatter,<br />
						<span class="i7">blatter-platter,</span>
						<span class="i9">patter-blatter,</span>
						<span class="i11">matter-clatter,</span>
						<span class="i13">flatter-quatter,</span>
						more violently than ever; and after they
						had fought for a week, they pecked each other all to little pieces,
						so that at last nothing was left of any of them except their bills.
						</p>
						<p>
						And that was the end of the seven young Storks.

						<p class="chapterdescription">THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG GEESE.</p>
						<p>
						When the seven young Geese began to travel, they went over
						a large plain, on which there was but one tree, and that was,
						a very bad one.
						</p>
						<p>
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page146" id="page146" title="146"></a>
						</p>
						<p>
						So four of them went up to the top of it, and looked about
						them; while the other three waddled up and down, and repeated
						poetry, and their last six lessons in arithmetic, geography, and
						cookery.
						</p>
						<p>
						Presently they perceived, a long way off, an object of the most
						interesting and obese appearance, having a perfectly round body
						exactly resembling a boiled plum-pudding, with two little wings, and
						a beak, and three feathers growing out of his head, and only one
						leg.
						</p>
						<p>
						So, after a time, all the seven young Geese said to each
						other, "Beyond all doubt this beast must be a Plum-pudding
						Flea!"
						</p>
						<p>
						On which they incautiously began to sing aloud,
						</p>
						<blockquote>
						<span class="i12">"Plum-pudding Flea,</span>
						<span class="i12">Plum-pudding Flea,</span>
						<span class="i12">Wherever you be,</span>
						<span class="i12">Oh! come to our tree,</span>
						<span class="i8">And listen, oh! listen, oh! listen to me!"</span>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
						And no sooner had they sung this verse than the Plum-pudding
						Flea began to hop and skip on his one leg with the
						most dreadful velocity, and came straight to the tree, where he
						stopped, and looked about him in a vacant and voluminous
						manner.
						</p>
						<p>
						On which the seven young Geese were greatly alarmed, and all
						of a tremble-bemble: so one of them put out his long neck, and
						just touched him with the tip of his bill; but no sooner had he
						done this than the Plum-pudding Flea skipped and hopped about
						more and more, and higher and higher; after which he opened
						his mouth, and, to the great surprise and indignation of the seven
						Geese, began to bark so loudly and furiously and terribly, that
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page147" id="page147" title="147"></a>
						they were totally unable to bear the noise; and by degrees every
						one of them suddenly tumbled down quite dead.
						</p>
						<p>
						So that was the end of the seven young Geese.

						<p class="chapterdescription">THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG OWLS.</p>
						<p>
						When the seven young Owls set out, they sate every now and
						then on the branches of old trees, and never went far at
						one time.
						</p>
						<p>
						And one night, when it was quite dark, they thought they heard
						a mouse; but, as the gas-lamps were not lighted, they could not
						see him.
						</p>
						<p>
						So they called out, "Is that a mouse?"
						</p>
						<p>
						On which a mouse answered, "Squeaky-peeky-weeky! yes, it is!"
						</p>
						<p>
						And immediately all the young Owls threw themselves off the
						tree, meaning to alight on the ground; but they did not perceive
						that there was a large well below them, into which they all fell superficially,
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page148" id="page148" title="148"></a>
						and were every one of them drowned in less than half a
						minute.
						</p>
						<p>
						So that was the end of the seven young Owls.

						<p>
						The seven young Guinea Pigs went into a garden full of goose-berry-bushes
						and tiggory-trees, under one of which they fell
						asleep. When they awoke, they saw a large lettuce, which had
						grown out of the ground while they had been sleeping, and which
						had an immense number of green leaves. At which they all
						exclaimed,&#8212;
						</p>
						<blockquote>
						"Lettuce! O lettuce<br />
						Let us, O let us,<br />
						O lettuce-leaves,<br />
						O let us leave this tree, and eat<br />
						Lettuce, O let us, lettuce-leaves!"
						</blockquote>
						<p>
										<a class="pagenumber" name="page149" id="page149" title="149"></a>
						</p>
						<p>
						And instantly the seven young Guinea Pigs rushed with such extreme
						force against the lettuce-plant, and hit their heads so vividly
						against its stalk, that the concussion brought on directly an incipient
						transitional inflammation of their noses, which grew worse and worse
						and worse and worse, till it incidentally killed them all seven.
						</p>
						<p>
						And that was the end of the seven young Guinea Pigs.

						<p class="chapterdescription">THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG CATS.</p>
						<p>
						The seven young Cats set off on their travels with great delight
						and rapacity. But, on coming to the top of a high hill, they
						perceived at a long distance off a Clangle-Wangle (or, as it is more
						properly written, Clangel-Wangel); and, in spite of the warning
						they had had, they ran straight up to it.
						</p>
						<p>
						(Now, the Clangle-Wangle is a most dangerous and delusive
						beast, and by no means commonly to be met with. They live in
						the water as well as on land, using their long tail as a sail when in
						the former element. Their speed is extreme; but their habits of
						life are domestic and superfluous, and their general demeanor pensive
										<a class="pagenumber" name="page150" id="page150" title="150"></a>
						and pellucid. On summer evenings, they may sometimes be
						observed near the Lake Pipple-Popple, standing on their heads, and
						humming their national melodies. They subsist entirely on vegetables,
						excepting when they eat veal or mutton or pork or beef or
						fish or saltpetre.)
						</p>
						<p>
						The moment the Clangle-Wangle saw the seven young Cats approach,
						he ran away; and as he ran straight on for four months,
						and the Cats, though they continued to run, could never overtake
						him, they all gradually <i>died</i> of fatigue and exhaustion, and never
						afterwards recovered.
						</p>
						<p>
						And this was the end of the seven young Cats.

						The seven young Fishes swam across the Lake Pipple-Popple,
						and into the river, and into the ocean; where, most unhappily
						for them, they saw, on the fifteenth day of their travels, a
						bright-blue Boss-Woss, and instantly swam after him. But the Blue
						Boss-Woss plunged into a perpendicular,<br />

						<p>
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page151" id="page151" title="151"></a>
						And the seven young Fishes, swimming with great and uncomfortable

						and, not being accustomed to it, were all suffocated in a very short
						period.

						to be labelled with parchment or any other anti-congenial succedaneum,

			<hr />
			<h3>THREE RECEIPTS FOR DOMESTIC COOKERY.</h3>
			<hr />
			<div class="recipe" id="cook1">
				<h4>TO MAKE AN AMBLONGUS PIE.</h4>
				<p>
				Take 4 pounds (say 4&#189; pounds) of fresh Amblongusses, and
				put them in a small pipkin.
				</p>
				<p>
				Cover them with water, and boil them for 8 hours incessantly;
				after which add 2 pints of new milk, and proceed to boil for 4
				hours more.
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page157" id="page157" title="157"></a>						</p>
				<p>
				When you have ascertained that the Amblongusses are quite
				soft, take them out, and place them in a wide pan, taking care to
				shake them well previously.
				</p>
				<p>
				Grate some nutmeg over the surface, and cover them carefully
				with powdered gingerbread, curry-powder, and a sufficient quantity
				of Cayenne pepper.
				</p>
				<p>
				Remove the pan into the next room, and place it on the floor.
				Bring it back again, and let it simmer for three-quarters of an hour.
				Shake the pan violently till all the Amblongusses have become of a
				pale purple color.
				</p>
				<p>
				Then, having prepared the paste, insert the whole carefully;
				adding at the same time a small pigeon, 2 slices of beef, 4 cauliflowers,
				and any number of oysters.
				</p>
				<p>
				Watch patiently till the crust begins to rise, and add a pinch of
				salt from time to time.
				</p>
				<p>
				Serve up in a clean dish, and throw the whole out of window
				as fast as possible.
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr />
			<div class="recipe" id="cook2">
				<h4>TO MAKE CRUMBOBBLIOUS CUTLETS.</h4>
				<p>
				Procure some strips of beef, and, having cut them into the
				smallest possible slices, proceed to cut them still smaller,&#8212;
				eight, or perhaps nine times.
				</p>
				<p>
				When the whole is thus minced, brush it up hastily with a new
				clothes-brush, and stir round rapidly and capriciously with a salt-spoon
				or a soup-ladle.
				</p>
				<p>
				Place the whole in a saucepan, and remove it to a sunny place,
				&#8212;say the roof of the house, if free from sparrows or other birds,&#8212;
				and leave it there for about a week.
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page158" id="page158" title="158"></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				At the end of that time add a little lavender, some oil of almonds,
				and a few herring-bones; and then cover the whole with
				4 gallons of clarified Crumbobblious sauce, when it will be ready
				for use.
				</p>
				<p>
				Cut it into the shape of ordinary cutlets, and serve up in a clean
				table-cloth or dinner-napkin.
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr />
			<div class="recipe" id="cook3">
				<h4>TO MAKE GOSKY PATTIES.</h4>
				<p>
				Take a pig three or four years of age, and tie him by the off
				hind-leg to a post. Place 5 pounds of currants, 3 of sugar, 2
				pecks of peas, 18 roast chestnuts, a candle, and 6 bushels of turnips,
				within his reach: if he eats these, constantly provide him
				with more.
				</p>
				<p>
				Then procure some cream, some slices of Cheshire cheese, 4
				quires of foolscap paper, and a packet of black pins. Work the
				whole into a paste, and spread it out to dry on a sheet of clean
				brown waterproof linen.
				</p>
				<p>
				When the paste is perfectly dry, but not before, proceed to beat
				the pig violently with the handle of a large broom. If he squeals,
				beat him again.
				</p>
				<p>
				Visit the paste and beat the pig alternately for some days, and
				ascertain if, at the end of that period, the whole is about to turn
				into Gosky Patties.
				</p>
				<p>
				If it does not then, it never will; and in that case the pig
				may be let loose, and the whole process may be considered as
				finished.

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
