<br>
<br>

<p>TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.</p>
<br>

<p>In preparing the following pages, my aim has been, to produce a book
alike entertaining and instructive;&mdash;one which, in the reading, should
afford an amusement to the mind, pleasant as the spring-blossoms on the
tree; and, in its influences on the heart in after life, be like the
good fruits that succeed and ripen, to refresh and nourish us, when the
vernal season is over and gone, and the voices of the singing-birds are
lost in the distance.</p>

<p>Choosing an appropriate title for such a presentation, I have borrowed
my idea from the words of the wise king of Israel:&mdash;&quot;Hear the
instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother; for
they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head,&quot; &amp;c., and other
Scripture passages of similar figurative meaning; for, though often
given in a sportive way, it is my design that no moral shall be
conveyed in the volume, but such as a good and judicious parent would
wish a child to imbibe.</p>

<p>Accept, then, my young Friends, this new CORONAL of the little flowers
of poesy which I have woven for you. When you shall have examined and
scented it, and found no thorn to pierce&mdash;no juice or odor to poison you
in its whole circle, wear it for the giver's sake; and enjoy it and
profit by its healthful influences, for your own.</p>

<p>Gladly would I feel assured that, in some future years,&mdash;when I shall
have done with earthly flowers, and you will be engaged in the busy
scenes and arduous duties of mature life,&mdash;the import of these leaves
may from time to time arise to your memory, in all its dewy freshness,
like the fragrance which the summer-breeze wafts after us, from the
lilies and violets we have passed and left far behind us, in our morning
rambles. Then, if not to-day, you will be convinced that I was&mdash;as now I
am,</p>

<p>Your true Friend,</p>

<p>H. F. GOULD.</p>

<p><i>Newburyport, Mass</i>., August, 1850.</p>

And these would sometimes come, and cheer<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The widow with a song,</span><br>
To let her feel a neighbor near,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wing an hour along.</span><br>
<br>
A pond, supplied by hidden springs,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With lilies bordered round,</span><br>
Was found among the richest things,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That blessed the widow's ground.</span><br>
<br>
She had, besides, a gentle brook,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wound the meadow through,</span><br>
Which from the pond its being took,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And had its treasures too.</span><br>
<br>
Her eldest orphan was a son;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For, children she had three;</span><br>
She called him, though a little one,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her hope for days to be.</span><br>
<br>
And well he might be reckoned so;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If, from the tender shoot,</span><br>
We know the way the branch will grow;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or, by the flower, the fruit.</span><br>
<br>
His tongue was true, his mind was bright;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His temper smooth and mild:</span><br>
He was&mdash;the parent's chief delight&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A good and pleasant child.</span><br>
<br>
He'd gather chips and sticks of wood<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The winter fire to make;</span><br>
And help his mother dress their food,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or tend the baking cake.</span><br>
<br>
In summer time he'd kindly lead<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His little sisters out,</span><br>
To pick wild berries on the mead,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fish the brook for trout.</span><br>
<br>
He stirred his thoughts for ways to earn<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some little gain; and hence,</span><br>
Contrived the silver pond to turn.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In part, to silver pence.</span><br>
<br>
He found the lilies blooming there<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So spicy sweet to smell,</span><br>
And to the eye so pure and fair,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He plucked them up to sell.</span><br>
<br>
He could not to the market go:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He had too young a head,</span><br>
The distant city's ways to know;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The route he could not tread.</span><br>
<br>
But, when the coming coach-wheels rolled<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To pass his humble cot,</span><br>
His bunch of lilies to be sold<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was ready on the spot.</span><br>
<br>
He'd stand beside the way, and hold<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His treasures up to show,</span><br>
That looked like yellow stars of gold<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just set in leaves of snow.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;O buy my lilies!&quot; he would say;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;You'll find them new and sweet:</span><br>
So fresh from out the pond are they,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I haven't dried my feet!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
And then he showed the dust that clung<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon his garment's hem,</span><br>
Where late the water-drops had hung,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he had gathered them.</span><br>
<br>
And while the carriage checked its pace,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To take the lilies in,</span><br>
His artless orphan tongue and face<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some bright return would win.</span><br>
<br>
For many a noble stranger's hand,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With open purse, was seen,</span><br>
To cast a coin upon the sand,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or on the sloping green.</span><br>
<br>
And many a smiling lady threw<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The child a silver piece;</span><br>
And thus, as fast as lilies grew,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He saw his wealth increase.</span><br>
<br>
While little more&mdash;and little more,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was gathered by their sale,</span><br>
His widowed mother's frugal store<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would never wholly fail.</span><br>
<br>
For He, who made, and feeds the bird,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her little children fed.</span><br>
He knew her trust: her cry he heard;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And answered it with bread.</span><br>
<br>
And thus, protected by the Power,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who made the lily fair,</span><br>
Her orphans, like the meadow flower,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grew up in beauty there.</span><br>
<br>
Her son, the good and prudent boy,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who wisely thus began,</span><br>
Was long the aged widow's joy;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lived an honored man.</span><br>
<br>
He had a ship, for which he chose<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The LILY&quot; as a name,</span><br>
To keep in memory whence he rose,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And how his fortune came.'</span><br>
<br>
He had a lily carved, and set,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her emblem, on her stem;</span><br>
And she was called, by all she met,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A beauteous ocean gem.</span><br>
<br>
She bore sweet spices, treasures bright;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, on the waters wide,</span><br>
Her sails as lily-leaves were white:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her name was well applied.</span><br>
<br>
Her feeling owner never spurned<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The presence of the poor;</span><br>
And found that all he gave returned<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In blessings rich and sure.</span><br>
<br>
The God who by the lily-pond<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had drawn his heart above,</span><br>
In after life preserved the bond<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of grateful, holy love.</span><br>



<hr style="width: 65%;">
<a name="The_Humming-Bird's_Anger"></a><h2><b>The Humming-Bird's Anger</b></h2>

<p>&quot;Small as the humming-bird is, it has great courage and violent
passions. If it find a flower that has been deprived of its honey, it
will pluck it off, throw it on the ground, and sometimes tear it to
pieces.&quot; BUFFON.</p>

On light little wings as the humming-birds fly,<br>
With plumes many-hued as the bow of the sky,<br>
Suspended in ether, they shine to the light<br>
As jewels of nature high-finished and bright.<br>
<br>
Their vision-like forms are so buoyant and small<br>
They hang o'er the flowers, as too airy to fall,<br>
Up-borne by their beautiful pinions, that seem<br>
Like glittering vapor, or parts of a dream.<br>
<br>
The humming-bird feeds upon honey; and so,<br>
Of course, 'tis a sweet little creature, you know.<br>
But sweet little creatures have sometimes, they say,<br>
A great deal that's bitter, or sour, to betray!<br>
<br>
And often the humming-bird's delicate breast<br>
Is found of a very high temper possessed.<br>
Such essence of anger within it is pent,<br>
'Twould burst did no safety-valve give it a vent.<br>
<br>
Displeased, it will seem a bright vial of wrath,<br>
Uncorked by its heat, the offender to scath;<br>
And, taking occasion to let off its ire,<br>
'Tis startling to witness how high it will fire.<br>
<br>
A humming-bird once o'er a trumpet-flower hung,<br>
And darted that sharp little member, the tongue,<br>
At once to the nectarine cell, for the sweet<br>
She felt at the bottom most certain to meet.<br>
<br>
But, finding some other light child of the air<br>
To rifle its store, had already been there;<br>
And no drop of honey for her to draw up,<br>
Her vengeance broke forth on the destitute cup.<br>
<br>
She flew in a passion, that heightened her power;<br>
And cuffing, and shaking the innocent flower,<br>
Its tender corolla in shred after shred<br>
She hastily stripped; then she snapped off its head.<br>
<br>
A delicate ruin, on earth as it lay,<br>
That bright little fury went, humming, away,<br>
With gossamer softness, and fair to the eye,<br>
Like some living brilliant, just dropped from the sky.<br>
<br>
And since, when that curious bird I behold<br>
Arrayed in rich colors, and dusted with gold,<br>
I cannot but think of the wrath and the spite<br>
She has in reserve, though they're now out of sight.<br>
<br>
Ye two-footed, beautiful, passionate things,<br>
If plumy or plumeless&mdash;without, or with wings,<br>
Beware, lest ye break, in some hazardous hour,<br>
Your vials of wrath, hot, or bitter, or sour!<br>
<br>
And would ye but know how at times ye do seem<br>
Transformed to bright furies, or frights in a dream,<br>
Go, stand at the glass&mdash;to the painter go sit,<br>
When anger is just at the height of its fit!<br>



<hr style="width: 65%;">
<a name="The_Butterfly's_Dream"></a><h2><b>The Butterfly's Dream</b></h2>

A tulip, just opened, had offered to hold<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A butterfly gaudy and gay;</span><br>
And rocked in his cradle of crimson and gold,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The careless young slumberer lay.</span><br>
<br>
For the butterfly slept;&mdash;as such thoughtless ones will,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At ease, and reclining on flowers;&mdash;</span><br>
If ever they study, 'tis how they may kill<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The best of their mid-summer hours!</span><br>
<br>
And the butterfly dreamed, as is often the case<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With <i>indolent</i> lovers of change,</span><br>
Who, keeping the body at ease in its place,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give fancy permission to range.</span><br>
<br>
He dreamed that he saw, what he could but despise,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The swarm from a neighboring hive;</span><br>
Which, having come out for their winter supplies,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had made the whole garden alive.</span><br>
<br>
He looked with disgust, as the proud often do,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the diligent movements of those,</span><br>
Who, keeping both present and future in view,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Improve every hour as it goes.</span><br>
<br>
As the brisk little alchymists passed to and fro,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With anger the butterfly swelled;</span><br>
And called them mechanics&mdash;a rabble too low<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To come near the station he held.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;Away from my presence!&quot; said he, in his sleep,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Ye humble plebeians! nor dare</span><br>
Come here with your colorless winglets to sweep<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The king of this brilliant parterre!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
He thought, at these words, that together they flew,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, facing about, made a stand;</span><br>
And then, to a terrible army they grew,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fenced him on every hand.</span><br>
<br>
Like hosts of huge giants, his numberless foes<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seemed spreading to measureless size:</span><br>
Their wings with a mighty expansion arose,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And stretched like a veil o'er the skies.</span><br>
<br>
Their eyes seemed like little volcanoes, for fire,&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their hum, to a cannon-peal grown,&mdash;</span><br>
Farina to bullets was rolled in their ire,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, he thought, hurled at him and his throne.</span><br>
<br>
He tried to cry quarter! his voice would not sound,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His head ached&mdash;his throne reeled and fell;</span><br>
His enemy cheered, as he came to the ground,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cried, &quot;King Papilio, farewell!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
His fall chased the vision&mdash;the sleeper awoke,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wonderful dream to expound;</span><br>
The lightning's bright flash from the thunder-cloud broke,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hail-stones were rattling around.</span><br>
<br>
He'd slumbered so long, that now, over his head,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tempest's artillery rolled;</span><br>
The tulip was shattered&mdash;the whirl-blast had fled,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And borne off its crimson and gold.</span><br>
<br>
'Tis said, for the fall and the pelting, combined<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With suppressed ebullitions of pride.</span><br>
This vain son of summer no balsam could find,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he crept under covert and died!</span><br>



<hr style="width: 65%;">
<a name="The_Boy_and_the_Cricket"></a><h2><b>The Boy and the Cricket</b></h2>

At length I have thee! my brisk new-comer,<br>
Sounding thy lay to departing summer;<br>
And I'll take thee up from thy bed of grass,<br>
And carry thee home to a house of glass;<br>
Where thy slender limbs, and the faded green<br>
Of thy close-made coat, can all be seen.<br>
For I long to know if the cricket <i>sings</i>,<br>
Or <i>plays</i> the tune with his gauzy wings;&mdash;<br>
To bring that shrill-toned pipe to light<br>
Which kept me awake so long last night,<br>
That I told the hours by the lazy clock,<br>
Till I heard the crow of the noisy cock;<br>
When, tossing and turning, at length I fell<br>
In a sleep so strange, that the dream I'll tell.<br>
<br>
Methought, on a flowery bank I lay,<br>
By a beautiful stream; and watched the play<br>
Of the sparkling wavelets, that fled so fast,<br>
I could not number them as they passed.<br>
But I marked the things which they carried by;<br>
And a neat little skiff first caught my eye.<br>
'Twas woven of reeds, and its sides were bound<br>
By a tender vine, that had clasped it round;<br>
And spreading within, had made it seem<br>
A basket of leaves, borne down the stream.<br>
And the skiff had neither a sail nor oar;<br>
But a bright little boy stood up, and bore,<br>
On his outstretched hands, a wreath so gay,<br>
It looked like a crown for the Queen of May.<br>
And while he was going, I heard him sing,<br>
&quot;O seize the garland of passing <i>Spring!</i>&quot;<br>
But I dared not reach, for the bank was steep;<br>
And he bore it away, to the far off deep!<br>
<br>
There came, then, a lady;&mdash;her eye was bright&mdash;<br>
She was young and fair, and her bark was light;<br>
Its mast was a living tree, that spread<br>
Its boughs for a sail, o'er the lady's head.<br>
And some of its fruits had just begun<br>
To flush, on the side that was next the sun;<br>
And some with the crimson streak were stained;<br>
While others their size had not yet gained.<br>
In passing she cried, &quot;Oh! who can insure<br>
The fruits of <i>Summer</i> to get mature?<br>
For, fast as the waters beneath me flowing,<br>
Beyond recall, I'm going! I'm going!&quot;<br>
<br>
I turned my eye, and beheld another,<br>
That seemed as she might be Summer's mother.<br>
She looked more grave; while her cheek was tinged<br>
With a deeper brown; and her bark was fringed<br>
With the tasselled heads of the wheaten sheaves<br>
Along its sides; and the yellow leaves,<br>
That had covered the deck concealed a throng<br>
Of <i>Crickets!</i>&mdash;I knew by their choral song.<br>
And at <i>Autumn's</i> feet lay the golden corn,<br>
While her hands were raised, to invert a horn<br>
That was filled with a sweet and mellow store,<br>
And the purple clusters were hanging o'er.<br>
She bade me seize on the fruit that should last<br>
When the harvest was gone, and Autumn had past.<br>
But, when I had paused to make the choice,<br>
I saw no bark! and I heard no voice!<br>
<br>
Then I looked on a sight that chilled my blood!<br>
'Twas a mass of ice, where an old man stood<br>
On his frozen float; while his shrivelled hand<br>
Had clenched, as a staff by which to stand,<br>
A whitened branch that the blast had broke<br>
From the lifeless trunk of an aged oak.<br>
The icicles hung from the naked limb,<br>
And the old man's eye was sunken and dim.<br>
But his scattering locks were silver bright,<br>
His beard with gathering frost was white;<br>
The tears congealed on his furrowed cheek,<br>
His garb was thin, and the winds were bleak.<br>
He faintly uttered, while drawing near,<br>
&quot;<i>Winter</i>, the death of the short-lived year,<br>
Can yield thee nought, as I downward tend<br>
To the boundless sea, where the Seasons end!<br>
But I trust from others, who've gone before,<br>
Thou'st clothed thy form, and supplied thy store<br>
And now, what tidings am I to bear<br>
Of thee&mdash;for I shall be questioned there?&quot;<br>
<br>
I asked my mother, who o'er me bent,<br>
What all this show of the Seasons meant?<br>
She said 'twas a picture of Life, I saw;<br>
And the useful moral myself must draw!<br>
<br>
I woke, and found that thy song was stilled,<br>
And the sun's bright beams my room had filled!<br>
But I think, my Cricket, I long shall keep<br>
In mind the dream of my morning sleep!<br>

<p><b>Fanny Spy</b></p>

Lucy, Lucy, come away!<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never climb for things so high.</span><br>
Don't you know, the other day,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What fell out with Fanny Spy?</span><br>
<br>
Fanny spied, a loaf of cake,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wisely set above her reach;</span><br>
Yet did Fanny think to make<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In its tempting side a breach.</span><br>
<br>
When she thought the family<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of sight and hearing too,</span><br>
Forth a polished table she<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quickly to the closet drew.</span><br>
<br>
First, she stepped upon a chair;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then the table&mdash;then a shelf;</span><br>
Thinking she securely there<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might, unnoticed, help herself.</span><br>
<br>
Then she seized a heavy slice,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leaving in the loaf a cleft</span><br>
Wider than a dozen mice,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Feasted there all night, had left.</span><br>
<br>
Stepping backward, Fanny slid<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the table's polished face:&mdash;</span><br>
Down she came, with dish and lid,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Silver&mdash;glass&mdash;and china vase!</span><br>
<br>
In, from every room they rushed,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Father&mdash;mother&mdash;servants&mdash;all,</span><br>
Thinking all the closet crushed,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the racket and the fall.</span><br>
<br>
'Mid the uproar of the house,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fanny, in her shame and fright,</span><br>
Wished herself indeed a mouse,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But to run and hide from sight.</span><br>
<br>
Yet was she to learn how vain,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor and worthless, is a wish.</span><br>
Wishing could not lull her pain,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hide her shame, nor mend a dish.</span><br>
<br>
There she lay, but could not speak;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a tooth had made a pass</span><br>
Through her lip; and to her cheek<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clung a piece of shivered glass.</span><br>
<br>
From her altered features gushed<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rolling tears, and streaming gore;</span><br>
While, untasted still, and crushed,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay her cake upon the floor.</span><br>
<br>
Then the doctor hurried in:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fanny at his needle swooned,</span><br>
As he held her crimson chin,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And together stitched the wound.</span><br>
<br>
Now her face a scar must wear,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ever till her dying day!</span><br>
Questioned how it happened there,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What can blushing Fanny say?</span><br>

Harry had a dog and gun;<br>
And he loved to set the one,<br>
Barking, out upon the run,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While he held the other,</span><br>
Often charged so heavily,<br>
'Twas a dangerous thing to be<br>
With so young a wight as he<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mindless of his mother.</span><br>
<br>
Earnestly she warned her child<br>
To forego a sport so wild;<br>
While he, turning, frowned or smiled,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And away would sidle.</span><br>
For, to give him short and long,<br>
Harry had a head so strong,<br>
In the right or in the wrong,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was hard to bridle.</span><br>
<br>
On his gunning madly bent,<br>
Often in his clothes a rent<br>
Told the reckless way he went,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over hedge and brambles.</span><br>
Homeward then would Harry slouch,<br>
With his gun and empty pouch,<br>
Looking like a scaramouch<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Coming from his rambles.</span><br>
<br>
Sometimes when he scaled a wall,<br>
Headlong there to pitch and fall,<br>
Ratling stones, and gun and all.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down together tumbled.</span><br>
Tray would bark to tell the news<br>
Of his master with a bruise,<br>
Hatless, and with grated shoes,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lying flat and humbled!</span><br>
<br>
Where he saw the bushes stirred,<br>
Harry, sure of hare or bird,<br>
Drew,&mdash;and at a flash was heard<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Noise like little thunder.</span><br>
When he ran his game to find,<br>
Disappointment 'mazed his mind;&mdash;<br>
Finding he'd but shot the wind,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dumb he stood with wonder!</span><br>
<br>
Over muddy pool or bog,<br>
Not so nimble as his dog,<br>
When he walked the plank or log,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There his balance losing,</span><br>
Splash! he went&mdash;a rueful plight!<br>
If his face before was white,<br>
'Twas like morning turned to night,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Much against his choosing.</span><br>
<br>
Now, like many a hasty one,<br>
Whether quadruped or gun,<br>
Or a mother's wayward son<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Given to disaster,</span><br>
Harry's gun was rather quick;<br>
And it had a naughty trick,&mdash;<br>
It would snap itself, and kick<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fiercely at its master.</span><br>
<br>
So, this snappish habit grew<br>
With a power for him to rue;<br>
Just as all bad habits do<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grow, as age increases.</span><br>
When, one day, with noise and smoke,<br>
Over-charged, the barrel broke,<br>
Harry's hand the mischief spoke&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was blown to pieces!</span><br>
<br>
Tray came crouching round, and growled,&mdash;<br>
Saw the gore, and whined, and howled,<br>
While his owner groaned and scowled,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the blood was running.</span><br>
With the horrors of his state,<br>
And with anguish desperate,<br>
Then poor Harry owned too late,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was <i>sick of gunning</i>!</span><br>
<br>
While his mother bent to mourn<br>
As her froward son was borne,<br>
With his hand all burnt and torn,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faint and pale, before her,</span><br>
Harry's pain must be endured,&mdash;<br>
And the wound&mdash;it might be cured;<br>
But, for fingers uninsured,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There was no restorer!</span><br>

&quot;I am a Pebble! I yield to none!&quot;<br>
Were the swelling words of a tiny stone,<br>
&quot;Nor time nor season can alter me;<br>
I am abiding, while ages flee.<br>
The pelting hail and the drizzling rain<br>
Have tried to soften me, long, in vain;<br>
And the dew has tenderly sought to melt,<br>
Or touch my heart; but it was not felt.<br>
There's none to tell you about my birth,<br>
For I am as old as the big, round earth.<br>
The children of men arise, and pass<br>
Out of the world, like blades of grass;<br>
And many foot that on me has trod<br>
Is gone from sight, and under the sod!<br>
I am a Pebble! but who art <i>thou</i>,<br>
Rattling along from the restless bough?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Acorn was shocked at this rude salute,<br>
And lay for a moment abashed and mute:<br>
She never before had been so near<br>
This gravelly ball, the mundane sphere;<br>
And she felt for a time at loss to know<br>
How to answer a thing so coarse and low.<br>
But to give reproof of a nobler sort<br>
Than the angry look, or the keen retort,<br>
At length she said, in a gentle tone,<br>
&quot;Since it has happened that I am thrown,<br>
From the lighter element where I grew,<br>
Down to another, so hard and new,<br>
And beside a personage so august,<br>
Abased, I'll cover my head with dust,<br>
And quick retire from the sight of one<br>
Whom time, nor season, nor storm, nor sun,<br>
Nor the gentle dew, nor the grinding heel<br>
Has ever subdued, or made to feel!&quot;<br>
And soon in the earth she sank away<br>
From the cheerless spot where the Pebble lay.<br>
<br>
But 'twas not long ere the soil was broke<br>
By the jeering head of an infant oak!<br>
As it arose, and its branches spread,<br>
The Pebble looked up, and, wondering, said,<br>
&quot;Ah, modest Acorn! never to tell<br>
What was enclosed in its simple shell;&mdash;<br>
That the pride of the forest was folded up<br>
In the narrow space of its little cup!&mdash;<br>
And meekly to sink in the darksome earth,<br>
Which proves that nothing could hide her worth!<br>
And O, how many will tread on me,<br>
To come and admire the beautiful tree,<br>
Whose head is towering towards the sky,<br>
Above such a worthless thing as I!<br>
Useless and vain, a cumberer here,<br>
Have I been idling from year to year.<br>
But never, from this, shall a vaunting word<br>
From the humbled Pebble again be heard,<br>
Till something without me or within<br>
Shall show the purpose for which I've been!&quot;<br>
The Pebble could ne'er its vow forget,<br>
And it lies there wrapt in silence yet.<br>

Ant, let me tell you 'tis not <i>&agrave; la mode</i><br>

Ant trudged along, while the grasshopper sung,<br>
Minding her business and holding her tongue,<br>
Until she got home her own people among;<br>

&quot;What will become of that poor, idle one<br>
When the light sports of the summer are done?<br>

&quot;Oh! if I only could tell him how sweet<br>
Toil makes my rest and the morsel I eat,<br>
While hope gives a spur to my little black feet,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He'd never pity my lot!</span><br>
He'd never ask me my burden to drop,<br>
To join in his folly&mdash;to spring, and to hop;<br>
And thus make the ant and her labor to stop,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When time, I am certain, would not.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;When the cold frost all the herbage has nipped,<br>
When the bare branches with ice-drops are tipped,<br>
Where will the grasshopper then be, that skipped<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So careless and lightly to-day?</span><br>
Frozen to death! '<i>a sad picture</i>,' indeed,<br>
Of reckless indulgence and what must succeed,<br>
That all his gymnastics can't shelter or feed,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or quicken his pulse into play!</span><br>
<br>
&quot;I must prepare for a winter to come,<br>
I shall be glad of a home and a crumb,<br>
When my frail form out of doors would be numb,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I in the snow-storm should die.</span><br>
Summer is lovely, but soon will be past.<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With pride in her air,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She'd go round, here and there,</span><br>
For all whom she knew to see that.<br>
<br>
Her folly was chiefly in this:<br>
More highly she valued fine looks,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than virtue or truth,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or devoting her youth</span><br>
To usefulness, friendship, or books.<br>
<br>
Her passion for show was unchecked;<br>
And therefore, it happened one day,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Arrayed in bright hues,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with new hat and shoes,</span><br>
Miss Vain walked abroad for display.<br>
<br>
She took the most populous streets.<br>
To cause but aversion in those,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who saw how she prinked,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the bystanders winked.</span><br>
While the boys cried, &quot;Halloo! there she goes!&quot;<br>
<br>
It chanced, that, in passing on way,<br>
She came near a pool, and a green<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With fence close and high;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, as Vivy drew nigh,</span><br>
A donkey stood near it unseen.<br>
<br>
He put his mouth over its top,<br>
The moment she came by his place;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gave a loud bray</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In her ear, when, away</span><br>
She sprang, shrieked, and fell on her face.<br>
<br>
She thought she was swallowed alive,<br>
Awhile upon earth lying flat;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the terrible sound</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seemed to furrow the ground</span><br>
She embraced in her fine gown and hat.<br>
<br>
She gathered herself up, and ran,<br>
Yet heeded not whither or whence,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To flee from the roar,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That continued to pour</span><br>
Behind her, from over the fence.<br>
<br>
In passing a slope near the pool,<br>
She slipped and rolled down to its brim;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The geese gave a shout,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And at length hissed her out</span><br>
Of the bounds, where they'd gathered to swim.<br>
<br>
In turning a corner, she met<br>
Abruptly, the horns of a cow<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That mooed, while the cur,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At her heels, turned from her,</span><br>
And aimed at Miss Vain his &quot;bow-wow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then Vivy's bright ribbons and skirt,<br>
As she flew, flirted high on the wind;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The children at play,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Paused to see one so gay,</span><br>
And all in a flutter behind.<br>
<br>
A group of glad schoolboys came by:<br>
Said they, &quot;So it seems, that to-day,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Miss Vain carries marks</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At which the dog barks,</span><br>
And that make sober Long-Ears to bray.&quot;<br>
<br>
And when, all bedraggled and pale,<br>
Poor Vivy approached her own door,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She went, swift and straight</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As a dart, through the gate,</span><br>
Abhorring the gay gear she wore.<br>
<br>
She sat down, and thought of the scene<br>
With humiliation and tears:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The words, and the noise</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the brutes and the boys</span><br>
Were echoing still in her ears.<br>
<br>
She reasoned, and came at the cause,<br>
Resolving that cause to remove;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thence, her desire</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was for modest attire,</span><br>
And her heart and her mind to improve.<br>
<br>
And soon, all who knew her before<br>
Remarked on the change and the gain<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In mind, and in mien,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in dress, that were seen</span><br>
In the once flashy Miss Vivy Vain.<br>

&quot;My kite! my kite! I've lost my kite!<br>
Oh! when I saw the steady flight,<br>
With which she gained her lofty height,<br>
How could I know, that letting go<br>
That naughty string, would bring so low<br>
My pretty, buoyant, darling kite,<br>
To pass for ever out of sight?<br>
<br>
&quot;A purple cloud was sailing by,<br>
With silver fringes, o'er the sky;<br>
And then I thought, it seemed so nigh,<br>
I'd make my kite go up and light<br>
Upon its edge, so soft and bright;<br>
To see how noble, high and proud<br>
She'd look, while riding on a cloud!<br>
<br>
&quot;As near her shining mark she drew<br>
I clapped my hands; the line slipped through<br>
My silly fingers; and she flew,<br>
Away! away! in airy play,<br>
Right over where the water lay!<br>
She veered and fluttered, swung and gave<br>
A plunge, then vanished with the wave!<br>
<br>
&quot;I never more shall want to look<br>
On that false cloud, or babbling brook;<br>
Nor e'er to feel the breeze that took<br>
My dearest joy, to thus destroy<br>
The pastime of your happy boy.<br>
My kite! my kite! how sad to think<br>
She flew so high, so soon to sink!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be this,&quot; the mother said, and smiled,<br>
&quot;A lesson to thee, simple child!<br>
And when by fancies vain and wild,<br>
As that which cost the kite that's lost,<br>
The busy brain again is crossed,<br>
Of shining vapor then beware,<br>
Nor trust thy joys to fickle air.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a darling treasure, too,<br>
That sometimes would, by slipping through<br>
My guardian hands, the way pursue,<br>
From which, more tight than thou thy kite,<br>
I hold my jewel, new and bright,<br>
Lest he should stray without a guide,<br>
To drown my hopes in sorrow's tide!&quot;<br>

Oh! the happy Summer hours.<br>
With their butterflies and flowers,<br>
And the birds among the bowers<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sweetly singing;&mdash;</span><br>
With the spices from the trees,<br>
Vines, and lilies, while the bees<br>
Come floating on the breeze,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Honey bringing!</span><br>
<br>
All the East was rosy red,<br>
When we woke and left our bed;<br>
And to gather flowers we sped,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gay and early.</span><br>
Every clover-top was wet,<br>
And the spider's silken net<br>
With a thousand dew-drops set,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pure and pearly.</span><br>
<br>
With their modest eyes of blue<br>
Were the violets peeping through<br>
Tufts of grasses, where they grew,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Full of beauty,</span><br>
At the lamb in snowy white,<br>
O'er the meadow bounding light,<br>
And the crow just taking flight,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Grave and sooty.</span><br>
<br>
On our floral search intent,<br>
Still away, away we went,&mdash;<br>
Up and down the rugged bent,&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through the wicket,&mdash;</span><br>
Where the rock with water drops,&mdash;<br>
Through the bushes and the copse,&mdash;<br>
Where the greenwood pathway stops<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the thicket.</span><br>
<br>
We heard the fountain gush,<br>
And the singing of the thrush;<br>
And we saw the squirrel's brush<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the hedges,</span><br>
As along his back 't was thrown,<br>
Like a glory of his own.<br>
While the sun behind it, shone<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through its edges.</span><br>
<br>
All the world appeared so fair,<br>
And so fresh and free the air,&mdash;<br>
Oh! it seemed that all the care<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In creation</span><br>
Belonged to God alone;<br>
And that none beneath his throne,<br>
Need to murmur or to groan<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At his station.</span><br>
<br>
Dear little brother Will!<br>
He has leaped the hedge and rill,&mdash;<br>
He has clambered up the hill,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ere the beaming</span><br>
Of the rising sun, to sweep<br>
With its golden rays the steep,<br>
Till he's tired, and dropped asleep,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sweetly dreaming.</span><br>
<br>
See, he threw aside his cap,<br>
And the roses from his lap,<br>
When his eyes were, for the nap,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Slowly closing:</span><br>
Wit his sunny curls outspread,<br>
On its fragrant mossy bed,<br>
Now his precious infant head<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is reposing.</span><br>
<br>
He is dreaming of his play&mdash;<br>
How he rose at break of day,<br>
And he frolicked all the way<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On his ramble.</span><br>
And before his fancy's eye,<br>
He has still the butterfly<br>
Mocking him, where not so high<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He could scramble.</span><br>
<br>
In his cheek the dimples dip,<br>
And a smile is on his lip,<br>
While his tender finger-tip<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seems as aiming</span><br>
At some wild and lovely thing<br>
That is out upon the wing,<br>
Which he longs to catch and bring<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Home for taming.</span><br>
<br>
While he thus at rest is laid<br>
In the old oak's quiet shade,<br>
Let's cull our flowers to braid,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or unite them</span><br>
In bunches trim and neat,<br>
That for every friend we meet,<br>
We may have a token sweet<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To delight them.</span><br>
<br>
'Tis the very crowning art<br>
Of a happy, grateful heart<br>
To others to impart<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of its pleasure.</span><br>
Thus its joys can never cease,<br>
For it brings an inward peace,<br>
Like an every day increase<br>

Where, snug in his shop, he defied all weather,<br>
A-drawing his quarters and sole together:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A happy old man was he!</span><br>
<br>
This happy old man was so wise and knowing,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The worth of his time he knew.</span><br>
He bristled his ends, and he kept them going;<br>
And felt to each moment a stitch was owing,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until he got round the shoe.</span><br>

Of every deed that his wax was sealing,<br>

The prick of his steel never caused a feeling<br>

Whenever you gave him a foot to measure.<br>

He took its proportions, with looks of pleasure,<br>
As if you were giving the costliest treasure,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or dubbing him lord of the land.</span><br>
<br>
And many a one did he save from getting<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fever, or cold or cough:</span><br>
For many a sole did he save from wetting,<br>
When, whether in water or snow 'twas setting,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His shoeing would keep them off</span><br>
<br>
And when he had done with his making and mending,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With hope and a peaceful breast,</span><br>
Resigning his awl, as his thread was ending,<br>

It snows, it snows! a merry play<br>
Is o'er us, on this sombre day.<br>

Though high and low the wind and sea<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might toss him up and down.</span><br>

Amid the waters dark and deep,<br>

When all around was storm, to keep<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair weather in his heart.</span><br>
<br>
Though winds were wild, and waves were rough,<br>

And when his only hat and shoes<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The waters plucked from him,</span><br>
Why, these, he felt, were small to lose,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could he keep up and swim!</span><br>
<br>
Then through the billows, foam, and spray,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That rose on every hand,</span><br>
He'd, somehow, always find a way<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of getting safe to land.</span><br>
<br>
The secret was, the fear and love<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Heaven had filled his soul:</span><br>
His trust was firm in One above,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Howe'er the seas might roll.</span><br>
<br>
And Tom had sailed to many a shore,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many a wonder seen:</span><br>
The stories he could tell would more<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than fill a magazine.</span><br>
<br>
He'd seen mankind in every state,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Almost, that man can know;</span><br>
But envied not the rich and great,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor scorned the poor and low.</span><br>
<br>
The monarch in his sight had stood,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Superb, in glittering vest;</span><br>
The savage, too, that roams the wood,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In skins and feathers dressed.</span><br>
<br>
The tribes of many an isle he knew;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And beasts, and birds, and flowers,</span><br>
And fruits, of many a shape and hue,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In lands remote from ours.</span><br>
<br>
He'd seen the wide-winged albatros<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her breast in ocean lave;</span><br>
And bold sea-lions, playing, toss<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their heads above the wave.</span><br>
<br>
He'd seen the dolphin, while his back<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went flashing to the sun,</span><br>
A swarm of flying fish attack,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And swallow every one!</span><br>
<br>
The porpoise and the spouting whale<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had sported in his view;</span><br>
And hungry sharks pursued his sail,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if they'd eat the crew.</span><br>
<br>
And ever, when Tom Tar got home,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The children, at their play,</span><br>
Were glad to have the Sailor come,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And greet them by the way.</span><br>
<br>
Then, oft, some curious stone, or shell,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The laughing girls and boys</span><br>
Would find, upon their aprons fell,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To put among their toys.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;These pearly shells,&quot; said he, &quot;I found<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where gloomy waters roar:</span><br>
These polished stones, so smooth and round,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rough surges washed ashore.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;Though small to us a pebble seems,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis made and marked by One,</span><br>
Who gave the warmth, and lit the beams<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of yon great shining sun.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;And when these pretty shells I find,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along the ocean strand,</span><br>
Their beauteous finish brings to mind<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their Maker's perfect hand.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;When on the wildest shore I'm thrown<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And far from human eye,</span><br>
I think of him who made the stone,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shell, and sea, and sky.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;For he's my Friend and I am his!<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though strong and cold the blast,</span><br>
My safest guide I know he is<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where'er my lot is cast.&quot;</span><br>
<br>
When Tom passed on, the children said,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;These treasures from afar</span><br>
He brought us! Blessings on his head!<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he's a good Tom Tar!&quot;</span><br>

<p>A FABLE</p>

A Lobster from the water came,<br>
And saw another, just the same<br>
In form and size; but gayly clad<br>
In scarlet clothing; while she had<br>
No other clothing on her back<br>
Than her old suit of greenish black.<br>
<br>
&quot;So ho!&quot; she cried, &quot;'tis very fine!<br>
Your dress was yesterday like mine;<br>
And in the mud below the sea,<br>
You lived, a crawling thing like me.<br>
But now, because you've come ashore,<br>
You've grown so proud, that what you wore&mdash;<br>
Your strong old suit of bottle-green,<br>
You think improper to be seen.<br>
<br>
&quot;To tell the truth, I don't see why<br>
You should be better dressed than I.<br>
And I should like a suit of red<br>
As bright as yours, from feet to head.<br>
I think I'm quite as good as you,<br>
And might be clothed in scarlet too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Will you be <i>boiled</i>&quot; her owner said,<br>
&quot;To be arrayed in glowing red?<br>
Come here, my discontented miss,<br>
And hear the scalding kettle hiss!<br>
Will you go in, and there be boiled,<br>
To have your dress, so old and soiled,<br>
Exchanged for one of scarlet hue?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; cried the Lobster, &quot;that I'll do,<br>
And twice as much, if needs must be,<br>
To be as gayly clad as she.&quot;<br>
Then, in she made a fatal dive,<br>
And never more was seen alive!<br>
<br>
Now, if you ever chance to know,<br>
Of one as fond of dress and show<br>
As that vain Lobster, and withal<br>
As envious you'll perhaps recall<br>
To mind her folly, and the plight<br>
In which she reappeared to sight.<br>
<br>
She had obtained a bright array,<br>
But for it, thrown her life away!<br>
Her life and death were best untold,<br>
But for the moral they unfold!<br>

Down in my solitude, under the snow,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where nothing cheering can reach me&mdash;</span><br>
Here, without light to see how I should grow,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I trust to nature to teach me.</span><br>
I'll not despair, nor be idle, nor frown;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though locked in so gloomy a dwelling!</span><br>
My leaves shall shoot up, while my root's running down,<br>

<a name="The_Bee_Clover_and_Thistle"></a><h2><b>The Bee, Clover, and Thistle</b></h2>

A bee from the hive one morning flew,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A tune to the daylight humming;</span><br>
And away she went o'er the sparkling dew,<br>
Where the grass was green, the violet blue,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the gold of the sun was coming.</span><br>
<br>
And what first tempted the roving Bee,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was a head of the crimson clover.</span><br>
&quot;I've found a treasure betimes!&quot; said she,<br>
&quot;And perhaps a greater I might not see,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I travelled the field all over.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;My beautiful Clover, so round and red,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is not a thing in twenty,</span><br>
That lifts this morning so sweet a head<br>
Above its leaves, and its earthy bed,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With so many horns of plenty!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
The flow'rets were thick which the Clover crowned,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the plumes in the helm of Hector;</span><br>
And each had a cell that was deep and round,<br>
Yet it would not impart, as the Bee soon found,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One drop of its precious nectar.</span><br>
<br>
She cast in her eye where the honey lay,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her pipe she began to measure;</span><br>
But she saw at once it was clear as day,<br>
That it would not go down one half the way<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the place of the envied treasure.<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span><br>
<br>
Said she, in a pet, &quot;One thing I know,&quot;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As she rose, and in haste departed,</span><br>
&quot;It is not those of the <i>greatest show,</i><br>
To whom for a favor 'tis best to go,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or that prove most generous-hearted!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
A fleecy flock came into the field;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When one of its members followed</span><br>
The scent of the clover, till between<br>
Her nibbling teeth its head was seen,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then in a moment swallowed.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;Ha, ha!&quot; said the Bee, as the Clover died,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Her fortune's smile was fickle!</span><br>
And now I can get my wants supplied<br>
By a homely flower, with a rough outside.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And even with scale and prickle!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
Then she flew to one, that, by man and beast<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was shunned for its stinging bristle;</span><br>
But it injured not the Bee in the least;<br>
And she filled her pocket, and had a feast,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the bloom of the purple Thistle.</span><br>
<br>
The generous Thistle's life was spared<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the home where the Bee first found her,</span><br>
Till she grew so old she was hoary-haired,<br>
And her snow-white locks with the silk compared,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they shone where the sun beamed round her.</span><br>

<a name="The_Sea-Eagle's_Fall"></a><h2><b>The Sea-Eagle's Fall</b></h2>

An Eagle, on his towering wing,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hung o'er the summer sea;</span><br>
And ne'er did airy, feathered king<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Look prouder there than he.</span><br>
<br>
He spied the finny tribes below,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amid the limpid brine;</span><br>
And felt it now was time to know<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereon he was to dine.</span><br>
<br>
He saw a noble, shining fish<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So near the surface swim,</span><br>
He felt at once a hungry wish<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make a feast of him.</span><br>
<br>
Then straight he took his downward course;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sudden plunge he gave;</span><br>
And, pouncing, seized, with murderous force,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His tempter in the wave.</span><br>
<br>
He struck his talons firm and deep,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the slippery prize,</span><br>
In hope his ruffian grasp to keep,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And high and dry to rise.</span><br>
<br>
But ah! it was a fatal stoop,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As ever monarch made;</span><br>
And, for that rash&mdash;that cruel swoop,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He soon most dearly paid!</span><br>
<br>
The fish had too much gravity<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To yield to this attack.</span><br>
His feet the eagle could not free<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From off the scaly back.</span><br>
<br>
He'd seized on one too strong and great;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His mastery now was gone!</span><br>
And on, by that preponderant weight,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And downward, he was drawn.</span><br>
<br>
Nor found he here the element<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where he could move with grace;</span><br>
And flap, and dash, his pinions went,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In ocean's wrinkled face.</span><br>
<br>
They could not bring his talons out,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His forfeit life to save;</span><br>
And planted thus, he writhed about<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon his gaping grave.</span><br>
<br>
He raised his head, and gave a shriek,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To bid adieu to light:</span><br>
The water bubbled in his beak&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He sank from human sight!</span><br>
<br>
The children of the sea came round,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The foreigner to view.</span><br>
To see an airy monarch drowned,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To them was something new</span><br>
<br>
Some gave a quick, astonished look,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And darted swift away;</span><br>
While some his parting plumage shook,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nibbled him for prey.</span><br>
<br>
O! who that saw that bird at noon<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So high and proudly soar,</span><br>
Could think how awkwardly&mdash;how soon,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He'd fall to rise no more?</span><br>
<br>
Though glory, majesty, and pride<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were his an hour ago,</span><br>
Deprived of all, that eagle died,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For stooping once too low!</span><br>
<br>
Now, have you ever known or heard<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of biped, from his sphere</span><br>
Descending, like that silly bird<br>

<a name="The_Two_Thieves"></a><h2><b>The Two Thieves</b></h2>

A lady, they called her Miss Mouse,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a slate-colored dress, like a Quaker,</span><br>
Once lived in a snug little house,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of which she herself was the maker.</span><br>
<br>
There lived in another close by,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dame, whom they called Lady Kitty;</span><br>
But that she was stationed so nigh,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Miss Mouse often thought a great pity.</span><br>
<br>
For she, though so soberly clad,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never inclined to ill-speaking,</span><br>
Had often a fancy to gad,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or more than her own might be seeking.</span><br>
<br>
She did not then like to be scanned,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or questioned respecting her duty,</span><br>
When some little theft she had planned,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or seen coming home with her booty.</span><br>
<br>
So modest she was, and so shy,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Although an inveterate sinner,</span><br>
She'd nip out her part of the pie<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before it was brought up to dinner.</span><br>
<br>
She held that 'twas folly to ask<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For what her own wits would allow her;</span><br>
And, making her way through the cask,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She helped herself well to the flour.</span><br>
<br>
The candles she scraped to their wicks;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, mischievous in her invention,</span><br>
Would do many more naughty tricks,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which I, as her friend, cannot mention.</span><br>
<br>
Kit, too, had her living to make,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet, she was so above toiling,</span><br>
She'd sooner attack the beef-steak,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the cook had prepared it for broiling.</span><br>
<br>
And so, near a dish of warm toast,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She often most patiently lingered,</span><br>
To seize her first chance; yet, could boast<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That none ever called her <i>light-fingered</i>.</span><br>
<br>
But mending, or minding herself,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She thought would be quite too much labor,</span><br>
And so peeped about on the shelf,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To spy out the faults of her neighbor.</span><br>
<br>
For Mouse loved to promenade there,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While Kit would watch close to waylay her;</span><br>
And once, in the midst of her fare,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up bounded Miss Kitty to slay her!</span><br>
<br>
But this was as luckless a jump<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As ever Kit made, with the clatter</span><br>
Of knife, skimmer, spoon, and a thump,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which she got, as she threw down the platter.</span><br>
<br>
While Mouse glided under a dish.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Escaping the mortal disaster,</span><br>
Miss Kitty turned off to a fish,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The breakfast elect for her master.</span><br>
<br>
Said she to herself, &quot;Tis clear gain,&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This rarity, fresh from the water,</span><br>
Will save my white mittens the stain&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And me from the trouble of slaughter!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
But her racket, she found to her cost,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The plot had most fatally thickened;</span><br>
And all hope of mercy was lost,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As Jack's coming footstep was quickened.</span><br>
<br>
He seized her, and binding her fast.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Declared he could never forgive her;</span><br>
So Kitty was sentenced and cast,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a stone at her neck, in the river!</span><br>
<br>
But Mouse still continued to thieve;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And often, alone in her dwelling,</span><br>
Would silently laugh in her sleeve,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the scene in the tale I've been telling&mdash;</span><br>
<br>
Till once, by a fatal mishap,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The little unfortunate rover</span><br>
Perceived herself close in a trap,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And felt that her race was now over.</span><br>
<br>
She knew she must leave all behind;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus, in the midst of her terrors,</span><br>
As every thing rushed to her mind,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Began her confession of errors:&mdash;</span><br>
<br>
&quot;You'll find, on the word of a Mouse,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom hope has for ever forsaken,</span><br>
The following things in my house,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which I have unlawfully taken:</span><br>
<br>
&quot;A cork, that was soaked in the beer,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which I nibbled until I was merry;</span><br>
Some kernels of corn from the ear,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The skin and the stone of a cherry:&mdash;</span><br>
<br>
&quot;Some hemp-seed I took from the bird,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And found most deliriously tasted,</span><br>
While safe in my covert, I heard<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its owner complain that 'twas wasted:&mdash;</span><br>
<br>
&quot;You'll find a few cucumber seeds,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which I thought, if they could but be hollowed,</span><br>
Would answer to string out for beads;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So the inside of all I have swallowed:&mdash;</span><br>
<br>
&quot;A few crumbs of biscuit and cheese,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which I thought might a long time supply me</span><br>
With luncheon&mdash;some rice and split peas,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which seemed well prepared to keep by me:&mdash;</span><br>
<br>
&quot;A cluster of curls which I stole<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At night from a young lady's toilet,</span><br>
And made me a bed of it whole,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As tearing it open would spoil it;&mdash;</span><br>
<br>
&quot;And as, in a long summer day<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd time both or reading and spelling,</span><br>
I gnawed up the whole of a play,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And carried it home to my dwelling.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;I wish you'd set fire to my place;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pray you at once to despatch me,</span><br>
That none of my enemy's race,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the form of Miss Kitty, may catch me!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
Disgrace thus will follow on vice,<br>

I knew a little heedless boy,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A child that seldom cared,</span><br>
If he could get his cake and toy,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How other matters fared.</span><br>
<br>
He always bore upon his foot<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A signal of the thing,</span><br>
For which, on him his playmates put<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The name of Jemmy String.</span><br>
<br>
No malice in his heart was there;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He had no fault beside,</span><br>
So great as that of wanting care.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To keep his shoe-strings tied.</span><br>
<br>
You'd often see him on the run,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To chase the geese about,</span><br>
While both his shoe-ties were undone,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With one end slipping out.</span><br>
<br>
He'd tread on one, then down he'd go,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all around would ring</span><br>
With bitter cries, and sounds of woe,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That came from Jemmy String.</span><br>
<br>
And oft, by such a sad mishap,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would Jemmy catch a hurt;</span><br>
The muddy pool would catch his cap,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His clothes would catch the dirt!</span><br>
<br>
Then home he'd hasten through the street,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To tell about his fall;</span><br>
While, on his little sloven feet,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cause was plain to all.</span><br>
<br>
For while he shook his aching hand,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Complaining of the bruise,</span><br>
The strings were trailing through the sand<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From both his loosened shoes.</span><br>
<br>
One day, his father thought a ride<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would do his children good;</span><br>
But Jemmy's shoe-strings were untied,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on the stairs he stood.</span><br>
<br>
In hastening down to take his place<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the carriage seat,</span><br>
Poor Jemmy lost his joyous face;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor could he keep his feet.</span><br>
<br>
The dragging string had made him trip,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bump! bump! went his head;&mdash;</span><br>
The teeth had struck and cut his lip,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tears and blood were shed.</span><br>
<br>
His aching wounds he meekly bore;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But with a swelling heart</span><br>
He heard the carriage from the door,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With all but him, depart.</span><br>
<br>
This grievous lesson taught him care,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gave his mind a spring;</span><br>
For he resolved no more to bear<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The name of JEMMY STRING!</span><br>

Upon the humble worm to tread,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As though it could not feel.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;Don't kill me! and I'll crawl away<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hide awhile, and try</span><br>
To come and look, another day,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More pleasing to your eye.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;I know I'm now among the things<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Uncomely to your sight;</span><br>
But by and by on splendid wings<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You'll see me high and light!</span><br>
<br>
&quot;And then, perhaps, you may be glad<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To watch me on the flower;</span><br>
And that you spared the worm you had<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-day within your power!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
Then Caterpillar went and hid<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In some secreted place,</span><br>
Where none could look on what he did<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To change his form and face.</span><br>
<br>
And by and by, when Charles had quite<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forgotten what I've told,</span><br>
A Butterfly appeared in sight,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most beauteous to behold.</span><br>
<br>
His shining wings were trimmed with gold,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many a brilliant dye</span><br>
Was laid upon their velvet fold,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To charm the gazing eye!</span><br>
<br>
Then, near as prudence would allow,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Charles's ear he drew</span><br>
And said, &quot;You may not know me, now<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My form and name are new!</span><br>
<br>
&quot;But I'm the worm that once you raised<br>

For sparing me, I long have praised,<br>

&quot;The lowest reptile at your feet,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When power is not abused,</span><br>
May prove the fruit of mercy sweet,<br>

Imbosomed by the foliage and flower.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there he sat and sang,</span><br>

With sounds, from out the merry mimic's bower.<br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The little satirist</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Piped, chattered, shrieked, and hissed;</span><br>
He then would moan, and whistle, quack, and caw;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, carol, drawl, and croak,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if he'd pass a joke</span><br>
On every other winged one he saw.<br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Together he would catch</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A gay and plaintive snatch,</span><br>
And mingle notes of half the feathered throng.<br>

To imitate the manner and the song.<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And paused awhile to hear</span><br>
How well he gave their voices and their airs.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some became amused;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While some, disturbed, refused</span><br>
To own the sounds that others said were theirs.<br>

On a plain rush-hurdle a silk-worm lay,<br>
When a proud young princess came that way.<br>
The haughty child of a human king<br>
Threw a sidelong glance at the humble thing,<br>
That received with a silent gratitude<br>
From the mulberry-leaf her simple food;<br>
And shrunk, half scorn, and half disgust,<br>
Away from her sister child of the dust;<br>
Declaring she never yet could see<br>
Why a reptile form like this should be;&mdash;<br>
And that she was not made with nerves so firm,<br>
As calmly to stand by a <i>crawling worm</i>!<br>
<br>
With mute forbearance the silk-worm took<br>
The taunting words and the spurning look.<br>
<br>
Alike a stranger to self and pride,<br>
She'd no disquiet from aught beside;<br>
And lived of a meekness and peace possest<br>
Which these debar from the human breast.<br>
She only wished, for the harsh abuse,<br>
To find some way to become of use<br>
To the haughty daughter of lordly man;<br>
And thus did she lay her noble plan<br>
To teach her wisdom, and make it plain<br>
That the humble worm was not made in vain;&mdash;<br>
A plan so generous, deep and high,<br>
That to carry it out, she must even die!<br>
<br>
&quot;No more,&quot; said she, &quot;will I drink or eat!<br>
I'll spin and weave me a winding-sheet,<br>
To wrap me up from the sun's clear light,<br>
And hide my form from her wounded sight.<br>
In secret then, till my end draws nigh,<br>
I will toil for her; and when I die,<br>
I'll leave behind, as a farewell boon<br>
To the proud young princess, my whole cocoon,<br>
To be reeled, and wove to a shining lace,<br>
And hung in a veil o'er her scornful face!<br>
And when she can calmly draw her breath<br>
Through the very threads that have caused my death;<br>
&quot;When she finds at length, she has nerves so firm,<br>
As to wear the shroud of a <i>crawling worm</i>,<br>
May she bear in mind that she walks with pride<br>
In the winding-sheet where the silk-worm died!&quot;<br>

<a name="Dame_Biddy"></a><h2><b>Dame Biddy</b></h2>

Dame Biddy abode in a coop,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because it so chanced that dame Biddy</span><br>
Had round her a family group<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of chicks, young, and helpless, and giddy.</span><br>
<br>
And when she had freedom to roam,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She fancied the life of a ranger;</span><br>
And led off her brood, far from home,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fall into mischief or danger.</span><br>
<br>
She'd trail through the grass to be mown,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And call all her children to follow;</span><br>
And scratch up the seeds that were sown,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, lie in their places and wallow.</span><br>
<br>
She'd go where the corn in the hill,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its first little blade had been shooting,</span><br>
And try, by the strength of her bill,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To learn if the kernel was rooting.</span><br>
<br>
And when she went out on a walk<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of pleasure, through thicket and brambles,</span><br>
The covetous eye of a Hawk<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Delighted in marking her rambles.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;I spy,&quot; to himself he would say,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A prize of which I'll be the winner!&quot;</span><br>
So down would he pounce on his prey,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bear off a chicken for dinner.</span><br>
<br>
The poor frighted matron, that heard<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cry of her youngling in dying,</span><br>
Would scream at the merciless bird,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That high with his booty was flying.</span><br>
<br>
But shrieks could not ease her distress,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor grief her lost darling recover.</span><br>
She now had a chicken the less,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For acting the part of a rover.</span><br>
<br>
And there lay the feathers, all torn.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And flying one way and another,</span><br>
That still her dear child might have worn,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had she been more wise as a mother.</span><br>
<br>
Her owner then thought he must teach<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dame Biddy a little subjection;</span><br>
And cooped her up, out of the reach<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of hawking, with time for reflection.</span><br>
<br>
And, throwing a net o'er a pile<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of brush-wood that near her was lying,</span><br>
He hoped to its meshes to wile<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fowler, that o'er her was flying.</span><br>
<br>
For Hawk, not forgetting his fare,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And having a taste to renew it,</span><br>
Sailed round near the coop, high in air,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With cruel intention, to view it.</span><br>
<br>
The owner then said, &quot;Master Hawk,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If you love my chickens so dearly,</span><br>
Come down to my yard for a walk,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That you may address them more nearly.&quot;</span><br>
<br>
But, &quot;No,&quot; thought the sharp-taloned foe<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Biddy, &quot;my circuit is higher!</span><br>
If I to his premises go.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twill be when I see he's not nigh her.&quot;</span><br>
<br>
The Farmer strewd barley, and toled<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The chickens the brush to run under,</span><br>
And left them, while Hawk growing bold,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus tempted, came near for his plunder.</span><br>
<br>
As closer and closer he drew,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With appetite stronger and stronger,</span><br>
He found he'd but one thing to do,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And plunged, to defer it no longer.</span><br>
<br>
But now he had come to a pause,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At once in the net-work entangled,</span><br>
While through it his head and his claws<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In hopeless vacuity dangled.</span><br>
<br>
The chicks saw him hang overhead,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where they for their barley had huddled;</span><br>
And all in a flutter they fled,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And soon through the coop holes had scuddled.</span><br>
<br>
The Farmer came out to his snare,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He saw the bold captive was in it;</span><br>
And said, &quot;If this play be unfair,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remember, I did not begin it!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
He then put a cork on his beak,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The airy assassin disarming,</span><br>
Unspurred him, and rendered him weak,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By blunting each talent for harming.</span><br>
<br>
And into the coop he was thrown:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The chickens hid under their mother,</span><br>
For he, by his feathers was known<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he, who had murdered their brother</span><br>
<br>
Dame Biddy, beholding his plight,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Determined to show him no quarter,</span><br>
In action gave vent to her spite;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As motherly tenderness taught her.</span><br>
<br>
She shouted, and blustered; and then<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Attacked the poor captive unfriended;</span><br>
And you, (who have witnessed a hen<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In anger,) may guess how it ended.</span><br>
<br>
She made him a touching address,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If pecking and scratching could do it;</span><br>
Till sinking in silent distress,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He perished before she got through it.</span><br>
<br>
We would not, however, convey<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A thought like approving the fury,</span><br>
That gave, in this summary way,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Punition without judge or jury.</span><br>
<br>
Whenever 'tis given, it tends<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To lessen the angry bestower.</span><br>
The <i>fowl</i> that inflicts it descends&mdash;<br>

So, up went her feet on the window-seat,<br>

Then over the carpet she tossed it,<br>

<br>
By and by her young mistress entered,<br>

I'll show you how I sport and flit,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And make my wings go up!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
The lid was raised; the prisoner said,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Behold my airy play!&quot;</span><br>
Then quickly on the wing he fled<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Away, away, away!</span><br>
<br>
From flower to flower he gayly flew,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To cool his aching feet,</span><br>
And slake his thirst with morning dew,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where liberty was sweet!</span><br>

I'm sorry they gave me the line and the hook;<br>
And wish I had staid at home with my book!<br>

Old Winter is coming, to play off his tricks&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make your ears tingle&mdash;your fingers to numb!</span><br>
So I, with my trowel, new mortar and bricks,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To guard you against him, already am come.</span><br>
<br>
An ounce of prevention in time, I have found,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is worth pounds of remedy taken too late!</span><br>
And proof that the sense of my maxim is sound,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will shine where I fasten stove, furnace or grate.</span><br>
<br>
The Summer leaves now whirling fast from the trees,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By Autumn's chill blast are tossed yellow and sere;</span><br>
And soon, with the breath of his nostrils to freeze<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each thing he can puff at, will Winter be here!</span><br>
<br>
But hardly he'll dare to steal in at the door,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your elbows to bite with his keen cutting air,</span><br>
And give you an ague, where I've been before,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To set the defence I to-day can prepare.</span><br>
<br>
And when he comes blustering on from the north,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To give you blue faces, and shakes by the chin,</span><br>
You'll find what the craft of the mason was worth,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you from abroad to your parlor step in!</span><br>
<br>
For all will around be so pleasant and warm,&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your hearth bright and cheering&mdash;your coal in a glow;</span><br>
You'll not heed the winds whistling up the rough storm<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To sift o'er your dwellings its clouds full of snow!</span><br>
<br>
You'll then think of me;&mdash;how I handled to-day<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cold stone and iron&mdash;the brick and the lime:</span><br>
And all, but the surer foundation to lay<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For comfort to give in the drear winter time.</span><br>

'Twould melt&mdash;should he enter&mdash;his hard hand and arm.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When loud for admission he threatens and roars.</span><br>
<br>
If gratitude then should come, warming your <i>heart</i>,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As peaceful you sit by your warm <i>fireside</i>;</span><br>
Perhaps it may teach you some good to impart<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To those, where the gifts you enjoy are denied.</span><br>
<br>
For He in whose favor all blessedness is;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And out of whose kingdom no treasure is sure,</span><br>
Was poor when on earth;&mdash;and the poor still are his:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His charge to his friends is &quot;<i>Remember the poor</i>.&quot;</span><br>
<br>
Nor would his disciple be higher than He,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who once on the dwellings of men, for his bread,</span><br>
In lowliness wrought! but contentedly, we<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will work by the light that our Master has shed.</span><br>

For our winter's honey is all to make,<br>

Come here and sit thee down by me!<br>
I've read a tale, I'll tell to thee;<br>
And precious will the moral be,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though simple is the story.</span><br>
It is about a brilliant flower,<br>
With beauty scarce possessed of power<br>
Its opening to survive an hour&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An airy Morning-Glory.</span><br>
<br>
'Tis common parlance names it thus;<br>
But 'twas a gay convolvulus:<br>
Yet we'll not stop to here discuss<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its species or its genus.</span><br>
We'll just suppose a blooming vine<br>
With many leaf and bud to shine,<br>
And curling tendrils thrown to twine<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And form a bower, between us.</span><br>
<br>
And we'll suppose a happy boy,<br>
With face lit up by hope and joy,<br>
Who thinks that nothing shall destroy<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His vine, his pride and pleasure,</span><br>
Is standing near, with kindling eye,<br>
As if its very look would pry<br>
The cup apart, therein to spy<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The growing floral treasure.</span><br>
<br>
And now the petal, twisted tight,<br>
Above the calyx peers to sight<br>
With apex tipped with purple, bright<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if the rainbow dyed it.</span><br>
While on the air it vacillates,<br>
Its owner's bosom palpitates<br>
To see it open, as he waits<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Impatient close beside it.</span><br>
<br>
Another rising sun has thrown<br>
Its beams upon the vine, and shown<br>
The splendid Morning-Glory blown,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if some little fairy,</span><br>
When early from his couch he went,<br>
On some ethereal journey bent,<br>
Had there inverted left his tent<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of purple, high and airy.</span><br>
<br>
And many a fair and shining flower<br>
As bright as this adorned the bower,<br>
Displayed like jewels in an hour,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where'er the vine was clinging.</span><br>
As each corolla lost its twist,<br>
The zephyr fanned, the sunbeam kissed<br>
The little vase of amethyst;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And round it birds were singing.</span><br>
<br>
And now the little boy comes out<br>
To see his vine. He gives a shout,<br>
And sings and laughs, and jumps about<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like one two-thirds demented.</span><br>
His little playmates, one, two, three,<br>
Come round the beauteous vine to see,<br>
And each cries, &quot;Give a flower to me,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I'll go off contented.&quot;</span><br>
<br>
But &quot;No,&quot; the selfish owner cried,<br>
And pushed his comrades all aside,<br>
While walking round his bower with pride,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Not one of you shall sever</span><br>
A floweret from the stem so gay;<br>
I own them, not to give away!<br>
I'll come to see them every day;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And keep them mine for ever!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
So, when at noon from school he came,<br>
To see his vine was first his aim:<br>
But oh! his feelings who can name,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As mute he stood and eyed it?</span><br>
For not a flower could he behold,<br>
While each corolla, inward rolled,<br>
Appeared as shrivelled, dead, and old<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if a fire had dried it.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;Alas!&quot; the selfish owner said,<br>
&quot;My Glories----oh! they all are dead!<br>
And all my little friends have fled<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Aggrieved! for I've abused them.</span><br>
They'll keep away, and but deride<br>
My sorrow, when they hear my pride<br>

To keep us up in flesh and heart,<br>

Could we contain our riches thus,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On such mysterious shelves,</span><br>
Why, none could rob or beggar us;<br>

<br>
But ah! my Toadie, there's the rub,<br>

To live as in the cynic's tub,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet be self-possessed!</span><br>
<br>
For, how to let no boast get round<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond our tub, to show</span><br>
That we in head and heart are sound,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is one great thing to know.</span><br>
<br>
And yet, the prison-staves and hoop<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To let no murmur through,</span><br>
However hard we find the coop,<br>

<br>
Then go, thou sage, resigned and calm,<br>

And to thy burrow bear the palm<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For victory over fate.</span><br>

And Frisk looked up with a grateful eye,<br>
As to him they dropped some crust of pie:<br>
For he, good dog, was his master's guide,<br>
By a cord to the ring of his collar tied.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now, would you like to hear me play,&quot;<br>
Said the traveller, &quot;ere you go your way?<br>
O, I did not think that aught so soon<br>
Could have put my poor old heart in tune.<br>
But you have touched it at the spring,<br>
And it seems as if it could dance and sing.<br>
Your kindness makes my spirit light,<br>
Till I hardly feel that I've lost my sight!&quot;<br>
<br>
He took up his violin and bow,<br>
And made his voice to their music flow;<br>
And the children, listening sat around<br>
As if by a spell to the circle bound.<br>
While thus they were fastened to the spot,<br>
And their first pursuit almost forgot,<br>
They felt they could ask no pleasure more,<br>
And their picnic frolic at once gave o'er.<br>
<br>
And there they staid till the sun went down,<br>
When they led the old Raymond safe to town;<br>
While Frisk went sporting all the way,<br>
To speak his thanks by his joyous play.<br>
They found him a room with a table spread,<br>
And a pillow to rest his hoary head.<br>
Then feeling their time and pence well-spent,<br>
They all went back to their homes content.<br>

O, I cannot bring to mind<br>
When I've had a look so kind,<br>
Gentle lady, as thine eye<br>
Gives me, while I'm limping by!<br>
Then, thy little boy appears<br>
To regard me but with tears.<br>
Think'st thou he would like to know<br>
What has brought my state so low?<br>
<br>
When not half so old as he,<br>
I was bounding, light and free,<br>
By my happy mother's side,<br>
Ere my mouth the bit had tried,<br>
Or my head had felt the rein<br>
Drawn, my spirits to restrain.<br>
But I'm now so worn and old,<br>
Half my sorrows can't be told.<br>
<br>
When my services began,<br>
How I loved my master, man!<br>
I was pampered and caressed,&mdash;<br>
Housed, and fed upon the best.<br>
Many looked with hearts elate<br>
At my graceful form and gait,&mdash;<br>
At my smooth and glossy hair<br>
Combed and brushed with daily care.<br>
<br>
Studded trappings then I wore,<br>
And with pride my master bore,&mdash;<br>
Glad his kindness to repay<br>
In my free, but silent way.<br>
Then was found no nimble steed<br>

So untiring, and so fleet<br>
Were these now, old, aching feet.<br>

But my troubles soon drew nigh:<br>
Less of kindness marked his eye,<br>
When my strength began to fail;<br>
And he put me off at sale.<br>
Constant changes were my fate,<br>
Far too grievous to relate.<br>
Yet I've been, to say the least,<br>
Through them all a patient beast.<br>
<br>
Older&mdash;weaker&mdash;still I grew:<br>
Kind attentions all withdrew!<br>
Little food, and less repose;<br>
Harder burdens&mdash;heavier blows,&mdash;<br>
These became my hapless lot,<br>
Till I sunk upon the spot!<br>
This maimed limb beneath me bent<br>
With the pain it underwent.<br>
<br>
Now I'm useless, old, and poor,<br>
They have made my sentence sure;<br>
And to-morrow is the day,<br>
Set for me to limp away,<br>
To some far, sequestered place,<br>
There at once to end my race.<br>
I stood by, and heard their plot&mdash;<br>
Soon my woes shall be forgot!<br>
<br>
Gentle lady, when I'm dead<br>
By the blow upon my head,<br>
Proving thus, the truest friend,<br>

Wilt thou bid them dig a grave<br>
For their faithful, patient slave;<br>

<a name="The_Bat's_Flight_By_Daylight_An_Allegory"></a><h2><b>The Bat's Flight By Daylight An Allegory</b></h2>

A Bat one morn from his covert flew,<br>
To show the world what a Bat could do,<br>
By soaring off on a lofty flight,<br>
In the open day, by the sun's clear light!<br>
He quite forgot that he had for wings<br>
But a pair of monstrous, plumeless things;<br>
That, more than half like a fish's fin,<br>
With a warp of bone, and a woof of skin,<br>
Were only fit in the dark to fly,<br>
In view of a bat's or an owlet's eye.<br>
<br>
He sallied forth from his hidden hole,<br>
And passed the door of his neighbor, Mole,<br>
Who shrugged, and said, &quot;Of the two so blind<br>
The wisest, surely, stays behind!&quot;<br>
But he could not cope with the glare of day:<br>
He lost his sight, and he missed his way;&mdash;<br>
He wheeled on his flapping wings, till, &quot;bump!&quot;<br>
His head went, hard on the farm-yard pump.<br>
Then, stunned and posed, as he met the ground,<br>
A stir and a shout in the yard went round;<br>
For its tenants thought they had one come there,<br>
That seemed not of water, earth, or air.<br>
The Hen, &quot;Cut, cut, cut-dah-cut!&quot; cried,<br>
For all to cut at the thing she spied;<br>
While the taunting Duck said, &quot;Quack, quack, quack!&quot;<br>
As her muddy mouth to the pool went back,<br>
For something denser than sound, to show<br>
Her sage disgust, at the quack to throw.<br>
The old Turk strutted, and gobbled aloud,<br>
Till he gathered around him a babbling crowd;<br>
When each proud neck in the whole doomed group<br>
Was poked with a condescending stoop,<br>
And a pointed beak, at the prostrate Bat,<br>
Which they eyed askance, as to ask, &quot;What's <i>that</i>?&quot;<br>
But none could tell; and the poults moved off,<br>
In their <i>select circle</i> to leer and scoff.<br>
<br>
The Goslings skulked; but their wise mamma,<br>
She hissed, and screamed, till the Lambs cried, &quot;Ba-a!&quot;<br>
When up from his straw sprang the gaping Calf,<br>
With a gawky leap and a clammy laugh.<br>
He stared&mdash;retreated&mdash;and off he went,<br>
The wondrous news in his voice to vent,&mdash;<br>
That he had discovered a <i>monster</i> there&mdash;<br>
A <i>bird four-footed, and clothed with hair</i>!<br>
And had dashed his heel at the sight so odd,<br>
It looked, he thought, like a <i>heathen god</i>!<br>
<br>
The scuddling Chicks cried, &quot;Peep, peep, peep!<br>
For Boss looks high, but not very deep!<br>
It is not a fowl! 'tis the worst of things,&mdash;<br>
low, mean beast, with the use of wings,<br>
So noiseless round on the air to skim,<br>
You know not when you are safe from him.&quot;<br>
<br>
There stood by, some of the bristly tribe,<br>
Who felt so touched by the peeper's gibe,<br>
Their backs were up; for they thought, at least,<br>
It aimed at them the <i>low, mean beast:</i><br>
And they challenged Chick to her tiny face,<br>
In their sharp, high notes, and their awful base.<br>
<br>
Then old Chanticleer to his mount withdrew,<br>
And gave from his rostrum a loud halloo.<br>
He blew his clarion strong and shrill,<br>
Till he turned all eyes to his height, the hill;<br>
When he noised it round with his loudest crow,<br>
That 't was none of the <i>plumed</i> ones brought so low.<br>
<br>
And, &quot;Bow-wow-wow!&quot; went the sentry Cur;<br>
But he soon strolled off in a grave demur,<br>
When he saw on the wonder, <i>hair</i>, like his,<br>
<i>Two ears</i>, and a kind of <i>doubtful phiz;</i><br>
And he deemed it prudent to pause, and hark<br>
In silence, for fear that the sight might <i>bark</i>!<br>
<br>
At last came Puss, with a cautious pat<br>
To feel the pulse of the quivering Bat,<br>
That had not, under her tender paw,<br>
A limb to move, nor a breath to draw!<br>
Then she called her kit for a mother's gift,<br>
And stilled its mew with the racy lift.<br>
<br>
When Mole of the awful death was told,<br>
&quot;Alas!&quot; cried she, &quot;he had grown too bold&mdash;<br>
Too vain and proud! Had he only kept,<br>
Like the <i>prudent Mole</i>, in his nest, and slept.<br>
Or worked underground, where none could see,<br>
He might have still been alive, like me!&quot;<br>
<br>
While thus, so early the poor Bat died,<br>
A cry, that it was but the fall of pride,<br>
And signs of mirth, or of scorn, were all<br>
He had from those who beheld his fall.<br>
They each could triumph, and each condemn;<br>
But no kind pity was shown by them.<br>
<br>
And now, should we, as a mirror, place<br>
This story out for the world to face,<br>
How many, think you, would there perceive<br>
Likeness to children of Adam and Eve?<br>

Or cracks a nut in time of prayer,<br>
Till many wish that Jack would come,<br>
A better boy, or stay at home.<br>
<br>
In short, he shows, beyond a doubt,<br>
That, if he does not turn about,<br>
And mend his morals and his ways,<br>
He yet must come to evil days;<br>

<a name="David_and_Goliath"></a><h2><b>David and Goliath</b></h2>

Young David was a ruddy lad<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With silken, sunny locks,</span><br>
The youngest son that Jesse had:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He kept his father's flocks.</span><br>
<br>
Goliath was a Philistine,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A giant, huge and high;</span><br>
He lifted, like a towering pine,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His head towards the sky.</span><br>
<br>
He was the foe of Israel's race.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A mighty warrior, too;</span><br>
And on he strode from place to place,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many a man he slew.</span><br>
<br>
So Saul, the king of Israel then,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Proclaimed it to and fro,</span><br>
That most he'd favor of his men<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The one, who'd kill the foe.</span><br>
<br>
Yet all, who saw this foe draw near,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would feel their courage fail;</span><br>
For not an arrow, sword, or spear,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could pierce the giant's mail.</span><br>
<br>
But Jesse's son conceived a way,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That would deliverance bring;</span><br>
Whereby he might Goliath slay,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus relieve the king.</span><br>
<br>
Then quick he laid his shepherd's crook<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon a grassy bank;</span><br>
And off he waded in the brook<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From which the lambkins drank.</span><br>
<br>
He culled and fitted to his sling<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Five pebbles, smooth and round;</span><br>
And one of these he meant should bring<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The giant to the ground.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;I've killed a lion and a bear,&quot;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said he, &quot;and now I'll slay</span><br>
The Philistine, and by the hair<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll bring his head away!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
Then onward to the battle-field<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The youthful hero sped;</span><br>
He knew Goliath by his shield,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by his towering head.</span><br>
<br>
But when, with only sling and staff,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The giant saw him come,</span><br>
In triumph he began to laugh;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet David struck him dumb.</span><br>
<br>
He fell! 'twas David's puny hand<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That caused his overthrow!</span><br>
Though long the terror of the land,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A pebble laid him low.</span><br>
<br>
The blood from out his forehead gushed.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He rolled, and writhed, and roared:</span><br>
The little hero on him rushed,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drew his ponderous sword.</span><br>
<br>
Before its owner's dying eye<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He held the gleaming point</span><br>
Upon his throbbing neck to try;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then severed cord and joint.</span><br>
<br>
He took the head, and carried it<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And laid it down by Saul;</span><br>
And showed him where the pebble hit<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That caused the giant's fall.</span><br>
<br>
The lad, who had Goliath slain<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With pebbles and a sling,</span><br>
Was raised in after years to reign<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As Israel's second king!</span><br>
<br>
'Twas not the courage, skill, or might<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which David had, alone,</span><br>
That helped him Israel's foe to fight<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And conquer, with a stone.</span><br>
<br>
But, when the shepherd stripling went<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The giant thus to kill,</span><br>
God used him as an instrument<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His purpose to fulfil!</span><br>

But their delicate heads by the frost had been nipped;<br>
Their stalks by the blast were all twisted and stripped;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nothing but ruin was there.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;Oh! how the rude autumn has spoiled the green hills!&quot;<br>
Exclaimed little Charles, &quot;and has choked the bright rills<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With leaves that are faded and dead!</span><br>
The few on the trees are fast losing their hold.<br>
And leaving the branches so naked and cold.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the beautiful birds have all fled.&quot;</span><br>

&quot;I know,&quot; replied Edward, &quot;the country has lost<br>
A great many charms by the touch of the frost,<br>

But then, it has opened the chestnut-burr too,<br>
The walnut released from the case where it grew;<br>

&quot;They'd queer kind of sights, I have heard Grandma' say,<br>

&quot;She says they had buttons as large as our dollars,<br>
To wear on their coats with their square, standing collars;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then, there's a droll sort of hat,</span><br>
Which Mary once fixed me one like, out of paper,<br>
And said she believed 'twas called <i>three-cornered scraper</i>;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perhaps, too, she'll let us see that.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;Oh! a glorious time we shall have! If they knew<br>
At the south, what it is, I guess they'd have one too;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I have heard somebody say,</span><br>
That, there, they call all the New England folks <i>Bumpkins,</i><br>
Because we eat puddings, and pies made of pumpkins,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And have our good Thanksgiving-day.&quot;</span><br>
<br>
&quot;I think, brother Charles,&quot; returned Edward &quot;at least,<br>
That they might go to church, if they don't like the feast;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For to me it is much the best part,</span><br>
To hear the sweet anthems of praise, that we give<br>
To Him, on whose bounty we constantly live:&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is feasting the ear and the heart.</span><br>
<br>
&quot;From Him, who has brought us another year round,<br>
Who gives every blessing, wherewith we are crowned,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their gratitude who can withhold?</span><br>
And now how I wish I could know all the poor<br>
Their Thanksgiving-stores had already secure,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their fuel, and clothes for the cold!&quot;</span><br>
<br>
&quot;I'm glad,&quot; said their father, &quot;to hear such a wish;<br>
But wishes alone, can fill nobody's dish,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or clothe them, or build them a fire.</span><br>
And now I will give you the money, my sons,<br>
Which I promised, you know, for your drum and your guns,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To spend in the way you desire.&quot;</span><br>
<br>
The brothers went home, thinking o'er by the way,<br>
For how many comforts this money might pay,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In something for clothing or food:</span><br>
At length they resolved, if their mother would spend it,<br>
For what she thought best, they would get her to send it<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where she thought it would do the most good.</span><br>

On our mountain of Savoy,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the shadow of a rock,</span><br>
Once I sat, a shepherd-boy,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Watching o'er my father's flock.</span><br>
<br>
We'd a happy cottage-home,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peaceful as the sparrow's nest,</span><br>
Where, at evening, we could come<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From our roamings to our rest.</span><br>
<br>
I'd a minstrel's voice and ear:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I could whistle, pipe and sing,</span><br>
While I roving, seemed to hear<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Music stir in every thing.</span><br>
<br>
But misfortune, like a blast.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swift upon my father rushed;</span><br>
From our dwelling we were cast&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At a stroke our peace was crushed.</span><br>
<br>
All we had was seized for debt:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the sudden overthrow,</span><br>
Even my fond, fleecy pet,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My white cosset, too, must go.</span><br>
<br>
Then I wandered, sad and lone,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where I'd once a flock to feed;</span><br>
All the treasure now my own<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was my simple pipe of reed.</span><br>
<br>
But a noble, pitying friend,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who had seen me sadly stray,</span><br>
Made me to his lute attend;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he taught me how to play.</span><br>
<br>
Then his lute to me he gave;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And abroad he bade me roam,</span><br>
Till the earnings I could save<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would redeem our cottage-home.</span><br>
<br>
Glad, his counsel straight I took&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I received his gift with joy;</span><br>
All my former ways forsook,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And became a minstrel-boy.</span><br>
<br>
With my mountain airs to sing,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forward then I roamed afar,</span><br>
Sweeping still the tuneful string&mdash;<br>
Having hope my leading star.<br>
<br>
In the hamlets where I've gone,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Groups would gather&mdash;music-bound:</span><br>
In the cities I have drawn<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">List'ners till my hopes were crowned.</span><br>
<br>
Ever saving as I earned,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I of one dear object dreamed;</span><br>
To my mountain then returned,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our cottage-home redeemed.</span><br>
<br>
Time has wiped away our tears;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here we dwell together blest;</span><br>
All our sorrows, doubts and fears<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have played and sung to rest.</span><br>
<br>
Here my aged parents live<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Free from want, and toil, and cares;</span><br>
All the bliss that earth can give<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deem they in this home of theirs.</span><br>
<br>
Life's night-shades fast o'er them creep;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All their wrongs have been forgiven&mdash;</span><br>
They have but to fall asleep<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In their cot, to wake in heaven.</span><br>
<br>
Gentle friend, dost thou inquire<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What's the lineage whence I came?</span><br>
Jesse is my shepherd sire&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">David-Jesse is my name!</span><br>

&quot;Come, grandfather, show how you carried your gun<br>
To the field, where America's freedom was won,<br>
Or bore your old sword, which you say was new then,<br>
When you rose to command, and led forward your men;<br>
And tell how you felt with the balls whizzing by,<br>
Where the wounded fell round you, to bleed and to die!&quot;<br>
<br>
The prattler had stirred, in the veteran's breast,<br>
The embers of fire that had long been at rest.<br>
The blood of his youth rushed anew through his veins;<br>
The soldier returned to his weary campaigns;<br>
His perilous battles at once fighting o'er,<br>
While the soul of nineteen lit the eye of four-score.<br>
<br>
&quot;I carried my musket, as one that must be<br>
But loosed from the hold of the dead, or the free!<br>
And fearless I lifted my good, trusty sword,<br>
In the hand of a mortal, the strength of the Lord!<br>
In battle, my vital flame freely I felt<br>
Should go, but the chains of my country to melt!<br>
<br>
&quot;I sprinkled my blood upon Lexington's sod,<br>
And Charlestown's green height to the war-drum I trod.<br>
From the fort, on the Hudson, our guns I depressed,<br>
The proud coming sail of the foe to arrest.<br>
I stood at Stillwater, the Lakes and White Plains,<br>
And offered for freedom to empty my veins!<br>
<br>
&quot;Dost now ask me, child, since thou hear'st here I've been,<br>
Why my brow is so furrowed, my locks white and thin&mdash;<br>
Why this faded eye cannot go by the line,<br>
Trace out little beauties, and sparkle like thine;<br>
Or why so unstable this tremulous knee,<br>
Who bore 'sixty years since,' such perils for thee?<br>
<br>
&quot;What! sobbing so quick? are the tears going to start?<br>
Come! lean thy young head on thy grandfather's heart!<br>
It has not much longer to glow with the joy<br>
I feel thus to clasp thee, so noble a boy!<br>
But when in earth's bosom it long has been cold,<br>
A man, thou'lt recall, what, a babe, thou art told.&quot;<br>



<hr style="width: 65%;">
<a name="Captain_Kidd"></a><h2><b>Captain Kidd</b></h2>

There's many a one who oft has heard<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The name of Robert Kidd,</span><br>
Who cannot tell, perhaps, a word<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of him, or what he did.</span><br>
<br>
So, though I never saw the man,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lived not in his day;</span><br>
I'll tell you how his guilt began&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To what it paved the way.</span><br>
<br>
'Twas in New York Kidd had his home;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there he left his wife</span><br>
And children, when he went to roam,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lead a seaman's life.</span><br>
<br>
Now Robert had as firm a hand,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A heart as stern and brave,</span><br>
As ever met in one on land,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or on the briny wave.</span><br>
<br>
'Twas in the third king William's time,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When many a pirate bold</span><br>
Committed on the seas the crime<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of shedding blood for gold.</span><br>
<br>
So Captain Kidd was singled out<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As one devoid of fears,</span><br>
To take a ship and cruise about<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against the Bucaniers.</span><br>
<br>
The ship was armed with many a gun,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And manned with many a man,</span><br>
Across the southern seas to run<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To foil the pirate's plan.</span><br>
<br>
But when she long, from isle to isle,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without success had sailed,</span><br>
And made no capture all the while,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her master's patience failed.</span><br>
<br>
The prizes he so oft had sought,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He found he sought in vain;</span><br>
And soon a wicked, bloody thought,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came into Robert's brain!</span><br>
<br>
His mind he opened to his men;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And found his guilty crew</span><br>
Agreed with him, that they, from then,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would all turn pirates too!</span><br>
<br>
He threw his Bible in the deep,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Defied its Author's will;</span><br>
And, with his conscience put to sleep,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Began to rob and kill.</span><br>
<br>
And now the desperado reigned,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A tyrant on the waves;</span><br>
While they whose blood his hands had stained,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went down to watery graves.</span><br>
<br>
No merchant ship could near him go,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which he would not annoy;</span><br>
For Kidd was passing to and fro,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seeking to destroy.</span><br>
<br>
He seized the vessel, plunged the knife<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the seamen's breast:</span><br>
And by a cruel waste of life,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His evil gains possessed.</span><br>
<br>
He then would make the nearest isle.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And go at night by stealth,</span><br>
To hide within the earth awhile<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His last ill-gotten wealth.</span><br>
<br>
Thus, many a shining wedge of gold<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This modern Achan hid;</span><br>
And many a frightful tale was told<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About the pirate, Kidd.</span><br>
<br>
But Justice does not slumber long;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If slow, she's ever sure.</span><br>
There's none too artful, quick, or strong<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For her to make secure!</span><br>
<br>
To Boston, with a brazen face,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pirate boldly went,</span><br>
Where he was seized; and in disgrace<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And chains, to England sent.</span><br>
<br>
The captain and his crew were there,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A solemn, fearful sight;</span><br>
Resigning life high up in air,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">E'en at the gibbet's height!</span><br>
<br>
For many a year their bodies hung<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along the river side;</span><br>
As beacons, showing old and young<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How they had lived and died.</span><br>
<br>
The wealth they hid was never found.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though often sought of men.</span><br>
'Tis where they placed it in the ground,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till they should come again!</span><br>
<br>
The earth has seemed by Heaven constrained.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The treasures to withhold</span><br>
That price of blood has none obtained,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or used the pirate's gold!</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am glad to quit the world.</span><br>
While with bitterness I'm thinking<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the evil I have done,</span><br>
To my caverns deep I'm sinking<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the coming of the sun.</span><br>
<br>
Oh! the heart of man will sicken<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that pure and holy light,</span><br>
When he feels the hopes I've stricken<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With an everlasting blight!</span><br>
For, so wildly in my madness<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have I poured abroad my wrath,</span><br>
I've been changing joy to sadness;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with ruins strewed my path.</span><br>
<br>
Earth has shuddered at my motion:&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She my power in silence owns;</span><br>
While the troubled, roaring ocean<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er my deeds of horror moans.</span><br>
I have sunk the dearest treasure&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've destroyed the fairest form:</span><br>
Sadly have I filled my measure;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I'm now a dying Storm!</span><br>
<br>
Yet, to man among the living,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With my final gasp and sigh,</span><br>
I, a solemn caution giving,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fain would serve him while I die.</span><br>
Not like me, shall he, descending<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swift to death, from being cease.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To eternal pain or peace!</span><br>

I am the tiniest child of earth!<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But still, I would like to be known to fame;</span><br>
Though next to nothing I had my birth,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lowest of all in my lowly name.</span><br>
<br>
Yet, if so humble my native place,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This I can say, in family pride&mdash;</span><br>
That I'm of the world's most numerous race,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made by the Maker of all beside.</span><br>
<br>
Although I'm so poor, I naught to lose;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still I'm so little I can't be lost!</span><br>
I journey about, wherever I choose,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And those who carry me bear the cost.</span><br>
<br>
The most forgiving of earthly things,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I often cling to my deadly foe;</span><br>
And, spite of the cruellest flirts and flings,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Arise by the force that has cast me low.</span><br>
<br>
When beauty has trodden me under foot,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've quietly risen, her face to seek,&mdash;</span><br>
Embraced her forehead, and calmly put<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Myself to rest in her dimpled cheek.</span><br>
<br>
I've ridden to war on the soldier's plume;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But startled and sprung, at the wild affray,&mdash;</span><br>
The sights of horror&mdash;of fire and fume;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fled on the wings of the wind away.</span><br>
<br>
I've visited courts, and been ushered in<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the proudest guest of the stately scene;</span><br>
I've touched his majesty's bosom-pin,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the nuptial ring of his lofty queen.</span><br>
<br>
At the royal board, in the grand parade,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've oft been one familiar and free:</span><br>
The fairest lady has smiled, and laid<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her delicate, gloveless hand on me.</span><br>
<br>
Philosopher, poet, the learned, the sage,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never declines a call from me;</span><br>
And all, of every rank and age.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Admit me into their <i>coteri</i>.</span><br>
<br>
I visit the lions of every where,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If human, or brute, and can testify</span><br>
To what they do, to what they wear,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wonders none ever beheld but I!</span><br>
<br>
And now, reviewing the things I've done,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forgetting my name, my rank and birth,</span><br>
I begin to think I am number ONE,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the great and manifold things of earth.</span><br>
<br>
I've still much more, I yet might tell,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which modesty bids me here withhold;</span><br>
For fear with my travels I seem to swell,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or grow, for an ATOM OF DUST, too bold!</span><br>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
