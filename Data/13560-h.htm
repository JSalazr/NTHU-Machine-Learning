<p>No use talking, it's perplexing,</p>

<p class="i2">Everything don't look the same;</p>

<p>Never had these curious feelin's</p>

<p class="i2">Till those MacIntyres came.</p>

<p>Quit my plowing long 'fore dinner,</p>

<p class="i2">Didn't hitch my team again;</p>

<p>Spent the day with these new neighbors,</p>

<p class="i2">Getting 'quainted with the men.</p>

<p>Talk about the prairie roses!</p>

<p class="i2">Purtiest flow'rs in all the world,</p>

<p>But they look like weeds for beauty</p>

<p class="i2">When I think of that new girl.</p>

<p>Strange, she seems so kind of friendly</p>

<p class="i2">When I'm awkward, every way,</p>

<p>And my tongue gets hitched and hobbled,</p>

<p class="i2">Everything I try to say!</p>

<p>There's one person, that Jim Johnson,</p>

<p class="i2">That there man I can't abide;</p>

<p>He's been milling around near Nancy,--</p>

<p class="i2">Durn his dirty, yaller hide!</p>

<p>Never really liked that Johnson;</p>

<p class="i2">Now, each time I hear his name,</p>

<p>Feel this state's too thickly settled,--</p>

<p class="i2">That is, since that new girl came.</p>

<p>If this making love to women</p>

<p class="i2">Went like breaking in a horse,</p>

<p>I might stand some show of winning,</p>

<p class="i2">'Cause I've learned that game, of course;</p>

<p>But this moonshine folks call 'courting,'</p>

<p class="i2">I ain't never played that part;</p>

<p>I can't keep from talking foolish</p>

<p class="i2">When I'm thinking with my heart.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">

</p>

<p>Now, those women that you read of</p>

<p class="i2">In these story picture books,</p>

<p>They can't ride in roping distance</p>

<p class="i2">Of that girl in style and looks.</p>

<p>They have waists more like an insect,</p>

<p class="i2">Corset shaped and double cinched;</p>

<p>Feet just right to make a watch charm,</p>

<p class="i2">Small, of course, because they're pinched.</p>

<p>This here Nancy's like God made her,--</p>

<p class="i2">She don't wear no saddle girth,</p>

<p>But she's supple as a willow,</p>

<p class="i2">And the purtiest thing on earth.</p>

<p>I'm in earnest; let me ask you--</p>

<p class="i2">'Cause I want to reason fair--</p>

<p>What durn business has that rope-necked</p>

<p class="i2">Johnson sneaking over there?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="header">4<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>Hands so soft and strong and tender,</p>

<p class="i2">When I shook a "how de do,"</p>

<p>They was loaded sure with something</p>

<p class="i2">Seemed to thrill me through and through;</p>

<p>Hair as black as fire-burnt prairie;</p>

<p class="i2">Eyes that dance and flash and flirt;</p>

<p>Every time she smiled she showed you</p>

<p class="i2">Teeth as white's my Sunday shirt.</p>

<p>Baked us biscuits light as cotton;</p>

<p class="i2">I can't eat mine any more,--</p>

<p>I must get some better breeches,--</p>

<p class="i2">Kind o' 'shamed of those I wore;</p>

<p>But I'm goin' there to-morrow,</p>

<p class="i2">Like enough I'll stay all day,</p>

<p>Seems to me too dry for plowing--</p>

<p class="i2">Durn that Johnson, anyway!</p>

</p>

<p>I ain't much on deep-down thinkin',</p>

<p class="i2">Reasoning out the way things go,</p>

<p>So I s'pose I'll keep on foolin'</p>

<p class="i2">Till in time I get to know.</p>

<p>I've had chills and fever 'n' ague;</p>

<p class="i2">Suffered till their course was run.</p>

<p>Maybe love just keeps on runnin',</p>

<p class="i2">Till a man has lost--or won.</p>

<p>One thing certain: I have got it;</p>

<p class="i2">Seems to struck in good and hard.</p>

<p>Makes me sometimes soft and tender;</p>

<p class="i2">Next thing I would fight my pard.</p>

<p>Appetite is surely failing,</p>

<p class="i2">Sometimes I don't eat a bite;</p>

<p>Dream of Nancy all the daytime,</p>

<p class="i2">That durn Johnson, half the night.</p>

<p>I've just got to get to plowin',</p>

<p class="i2">Break a fire-guard 'round my shack,</p>

<p>Plant my sod corn, fix my garden;</p>

<p class="i2">Everything is goin' to rack.</p>

<p>I can't work the way I used to;</p>

<p class="i2">Got to quittin' early now,</p>

<p>Since a little thing that happened,</p>

<p class="i2">I can't just remember how.</p>

<p>I was takin' leave of Nancy,</p>

<p class="i2">Standin' out there in the night,</p>

<p>And I put my arms around her--</p>

<p class="i2">Heart stopped beatin', just from fright.</p>

<p>Can't express the kind of feelin',--</p>

<p class="i2">Words wa'n't never made for this,--</p>

<p>As I drew her face up closer,</p>

<p class="i2">And I stole my first sweet kiss.</p>

<p>Through the dingy sodhouse window</p>

<p class="i2">Gleamed a sickly yellow light,</p>

<p>Where I helped you from the wagon,</p>

<p class="i2">Holding you so loving tight.</p>

<p>Then they called out, "Choose your pardners,</p>

<p class="i2">Numbers five, six, seven, and eight,"</p>

<p>To that mess of cowhide-covered</p>

<p class="i2">Feet that stomped at every call.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the thing I looked for</p>

<p class="i2">Come to pass when Aleck Rose</p>

<p>Tried to <i>dos-a-dos</i>by you, dear,</p>

<p class="i2">And, instead, waltzed on your toes.</p>

<p>Recollect? I stopped the fiddler,</p>

<p class="i2">And I stopped that stomping crowd,</p>

<p>Using language that was decent,</p>

<p class="i2">But was mighty clear and loud:</p>

<p>"Now, you fellers from the Sand Hills,</p>

<p class="i2">Fight me, or if you refuse</p>

<p>You don't dance with me and Nancy</p>

<p class="i2">In respect for you and me,</p>

<p>Putting all on equal footing,</p>

<p class="i2">Just the way it ought to be.</p>

<p class="i2">That we knew in that quadrille,</p>

<p>But it didn't seem like dancin',</p>

<p class="i2">Steppin' round so awful still.</p>

<p>Fiddler, even, did his calling</p>

<p class="i2">In a sort of quiet hush--</p>

<p>"Swing your pardners," "Back to places,"</p>

<p>Rode a speckled chestnut pony</p>

<p class="i2">With a white star in his face;</p>

<p>Asked some questions 'bout the country,</p>

<p class="i2">'Bout the proper crossing-place.</p>

<p>Pulled out sometime long 'fore daylight.</p>

<p class="i2">He'll find grass that's mighty fine.</p>

<p>Chances are that he'll keep goin'</p>

<p class="i2">Till he strikes Nebraska's line.</p>

<p>It was just the next day after</p>

<p class="i2">That my cattle scattered so;</p>

<p>Some strayed off 'way south to Jimson's,</p>

<p class="i2">One bunch in the bend below.</p>

<p>Hid from view the sloughs and hollows,</p>

<p class="i2">Billy took the northern trail.</p>

<p>Through the sunflowers in the low land,</p>

<p class="i2">Plodding over sandstone knolls,</p>

<p>Winding through the level stretches</p>

<p class="i2">Dotted thick with treacherous holes</p>

<p>Where the prairie dogs sat chattering,</p>

<p class="i2">Bolt upright upon their mounds,</p>

<p>While the ground owls sought their burrows,</p>

<p class="i2">Startled by the warning sounds;</p>

<p>Stumbling into buffalo wallows,</p>

<p>As a greeting to the trav'ler,</p>

<p class="i2">Solace to the toilsome hours.</p>

<p>Old Jack Rabbit hopped before him,</p>

<p class="i2">Then sat up, to watch him pass,</p>

<p>Dusky horned-toads scurried nimbly</p>

<p class="i2">Through the withered buffalo grass.</p>

<p>Here and there the buzzing rattler</p>

<p class="i2">Whirred a warning, head alert,</p>

<p>Then retreated from the snapping,</p>

<p class="i2">Stinging strokes of Billy's quirt.</p>

<p>Day by day the wild breeze flying,</p>

<p class="i2">With'ring in its scorching heat,</p>

<p>Day by day this panorama</p>

<p class="i2">Passing slowly, dully by,</p>

<p>With the sun's brass disc high gleaming</p>

<p class="i2">From a white and cloudless sky,</p>

<p>Sometimes drew fantastic pictures.</p>

<p class="i2">Many a strange and gruesome sign--</p>

<p>Phantom trees and fairy castles--</p>

<p class="i2">Blurred the far horizon line.</p>

<p class="i2">Nectar to his thirsty lips.</p>

<p class="i2">And reclining there alone,</p>

<p>Heard the swiftly sweeping breezes</p>

<p class="i2">Sing in dreary monotone</p>

<p>Strange wild anthems, weird and lonesome,</p>

<p>Stamped along the endless roadway</p>

<p class="i2">Printed by the turning wheel,</p>

<p>Pressed its image on the memory</p>

<p class="i2">Of the settlers coming back,</p>

<p>Who, when questioned by the searcher,</p>

<p class="i2">Told him that the telltale track</p>

<p>Had begun to veer to westward</p>

<p class="i2">After crossing by the way</p>

<p>Billy paused beside the cripple</p>

<p class="i2">Of a wind-torn twisted tree,</p>

<p>Standing there, marooned forever,</p>

<p class="i2">Where its hapless seed had blown,</p>

<p>Miles on miles from forest neighbor,</p>

<p class="i2">Struggling out its life alone.</p>

<p>Here he stopped, with head uncovered,</p>

<p class="i2">Conscious of a strange appeal,</p>

<p>Yielding to the voiceless longing</p>

<p class="i2">Human hearts are bound to feel</p>

<p>When their lot is isolation,</p>

<p class="i2">And a field of sterile soil</p>

<p>And they held that sacred converse</p>

<p class="i2">Which the soul alone can hear.</p>

<p>While the horses browsed the sage brush,</p>

<p class="i2">And the sun withdrew his light,</p>

<p>And the moon in mournful splendor</p>

<p class="i2">Ushered in the lonely night,</p>

<p>He lay down beneath the branches,</p>

<p class="i2">Wrapped in musings strange and deep--</p>

<p>Seated on a throne of glory</p>

<p class="i2">Bearing royal title, Day.</p>

<p>Then some mighty power transcendent,</p>

<p class="i2">Thrust him from his gorgeous throne,</p>

<p>Turning all the realm to darkness,</p>

<p>As the silent winter prairie</p>

<p class="i2">Lies beneath its shroud of death.</p>

<p>Ofttimes when the raging sickness</p>

<p class="i2">Sent the hot blood to his brain,</p>

<p>One day, o'er the hill's low summit,</p>

<p class="i2">Whence the prairie dipped away,</p>

<p>There appeared a moving wagon</p>

<p class="i2">With its canvas patched and gray,</p>

<p>Like a vessel on the ocean</p>

<p class="i2">Under taut and close-reefed sail,</p>

<p>Rising slowly on the billows</p>

<p class="i2">Heaped up by the driving gale.</p>

<p>Veering towards the little dug-out,</p>

<p class="i2">Making for a friendly shore,</p>

<p>Heaving to, the schooner anchored</p>

<p class="i2">Close beside the open door.</p>

<p>Loud and hearty were the greetings,</p>

<p class="i2">For the driver of the team</p>

<p>Was Tom Frothingham, a neighbor,</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="header">14<br>

<p>Bit by bit he told the story--</p>

<p class="i2">How he'd wandered all around</p>

<p>Since he left his Kansas homestead</p>

<p class="i2">And the folks near North Pole mound;</p>

<p>How he'd traveled all through Texas</p>

<p class="i2">With the roving fever on,</p>

<p>Camping oft in strange new places,</p>

<p class="i2">Where no other soul had gone.</p>

<p>So the news, now half forgotten</p>

<p class="i2">In his absence from the place,</p>

<p>Came in broken recollections--</p>

<p class="i2">Careful efforts to retrace</p>

<p>All the incidents of interest</p>

<p class="i2">To the sick one listening there,</p>

<p>Who, with pale and careworn features,</p>

<p>"Three weeks after you left Kansas</p>

<p class="i2">Running spring and good clear land--</p>

<p>Everything a body needed</p>

<p class="i2">For a starter, right at hand.</p>

<p>Well, some others left 'fore I did--</p>

<p class="i2">You remember Mac, of course,</p>

<p>How he got the moving notion</p>

<p class="i2">When Bill Kelly missed his horse?</p>

<p>Chased him clear to Old Man's crossing,</p>

<p class="i2">So I heard the posse say;</p>

<p class="i2">What is natural may seem queer,</p>

<p>One thing happened since you left there</p>

<p class="i2">That I call a burning shame--</p>

<p>Did you know that rope-necked Johnson</p>

<p class="i2">Jumped your eighty-acre claim?</p>

<p>Last I saw him, he was plowing,</p>

<p class="i2">And he laughed and tried to joke:</p>

<p>Said 'twas kind of you to leave him</p>

<p class="i2">All the ground that you had broke;</p>

<p>Said your house was so untidy</p>

<p class="i2">He was sleeping out of doors,</p>

<p>Here no lighted torch or camp fire</p>

<p class="i2">With its weak and fitful ray,</p>

<p>Could illume the mystic journey</p>

<p class="i2">Of prayer's consecrated way.</p>

<p>Here the silence brought its message</p>

<p>Seated on a throne of glory,</p>

<p class="i2">Bearing royal title, Day.</p>

<p>Then some mighty power transcendent,</p>

<p class="i2">Splashed with demon-tinted blood</p>

<p>From the hue of burning prairie</p>

<p class="i2">Throbbed above the fiery flood.</p>

<p>Leaping o'er the rounded bluff-tops,</p>

<p class="i2">Crackling flames swept all before.</p>

<p>Then the driftwood's rifted breastwork,</p>

<p class="i2">Left there by the waters high,</p>

<p>Flashed up in a hissing furnace,</p>

<p class="i2">As the red-armed fiends leaped by.</p>

<p>Clinging to the swaying saddle</p>

<p>Uncontrolled, his furious anger</p>

<p class="i2">Spoke in quick and murderous roar</p>

<p class="i2">Through the barred and bolted door.</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
