    <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

    <h2>THE WRECK OF THE <i>SIRDAR</i></h2>

    <p>Lady Tozer adjusted her gold-rimmed eye-glasses with an air
    of dignified aggressiveness. She had lived too many years in
    the Far East. In Hong Kong she was known as the "Mandarin." Her
    powers of merciless inquisition suggested torments long drawn
    out. The commander of the <i>Sirdar</i>, homeward bound from
    Shanghai, knew that he was about to be stretched on the rack
    when he took his seat at the saloon table.</p>

    <p>"Is it true, captain, that we are running into a typhoon?"
    demanded her ladyship.</p>

    <p>"From whom did you learn that, Lady Tozer?" Captain Ross was
    wary, though somewhat surprised.</p>

    <p>"From Miss Deane. I understood her a moment ago to say that
    you had told her."</p>

    <p>"I?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't you? Some one told me this morning. I couldn't have
    guessed it, could I?" Miss Iris Deane's large blue eyes
    surveyed him with innocent indifference to strict accuracy.
    Incidentally, she had obtained the information from her maid, a
    nose-tilted coquette who extracted ship's secrets from a
    youthful quartermaster.</p>

    <p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;I had forgotten," explained the tactful
    sailor.</p>

    <p>"Is it true?"</p>

    <p>Lady Tozer <i>was</i> unusually abrupt today. But she was
    annoyed by the assumption that the captain took a mere girl
    into his confidence and passed over the wife of the ex-Chief
    Justice of Hong Kong.</p>

    <p>"Yes, it is," said Captain Ross, equally curt, and silently
    thanking the fates that her ladyship was going home for the
    last time.</p>

    <p>"How horrible!" she gasped, in unaffected alarm. This return
    to femininity soothed the sailor's ruffled temper.</p>

    <p>Sir John, her husband, frowned judicially. That frown
    constituted his legal stock-in-trade, yet it passed current for
    wisdom with the Hong Kong bar.</p>

    <p>"What evidence have you?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"Do tell us," chimed in Iris, delightfully unconscious of
    interrupting the court. "Did you find out when you squinted at
    the sun?"</p>

    <p>The captain smiled. "You are nearer the mark than possibly
    you imagine, Miss Deane," he said. "When we took our
    observations yesterday there was a very weird-looking halo
    around the sun. This morning you may have noticed several light
    squalls and a smooth sea marked occasionally by strong ripples.
    The barometer is falling rapidly, and I expect that, as the day
    wears, we will encounter a heavy swell. If the sky looks wild
    tonight, and especially if we observe a heavy bank of cloud
    approaching from the north-west, you see the crockery dancing
    about the table at dinner. I am afraid you are not a good
    sailor, Lady Tozer. Are you, Miss Deane?"</p>

    <p>"Capital! I should just love to see a real storm. Now
    promise me solemnly that you will take me up into the
    charthouse when this typhoon is simply tearing things to
    pieces."</p>

    <p>"Oh dear! I do hope it will not be very bad. Is there no way
    in which you can avoid it, captain? Will it last long?"</p>

    <p>The politic skipper for once preferred to answer Lady Tozer.
    "There is no cause for uneasiness," he said. "Of course,
    typhoons in the China Sea are nasty things while they last, but
    a ship like the <i>Sirdar</i> is not troubled by them. She will
    drive through the worst gale she is likely to meet here in less
    than twelve hours. Besides, I alter the course somewhat as soon
    as I discover our position with regard to its center. You see,
    Miss Deane&mdash;"</p>

    <p>And Captain Ross forthwith illustrated on the back of a menu
    card the spiral shape and progress of a cyclone. He so
    thoroughly mystified the girl by his technical references to
    northern and southern hemispheres, polar directions, revolving
    air-currents, external circumferences, and diminished
    atmospheric pressures, that she was too bewildered to reiterate
    a desire to visit the bridge.</p>

    <p>Then the commander hurriedly excused himself, and the
    passengers saw no more of him that day.</p>

    <p>But his short scientific lecture achieved a double result.
    It rescued him from a request which he could not possibly
    grant, and reassured Lady Tozer. To the non-nautical mind it is
    the unknown that is fearful. A storm classed as "periodic,"
    whose velocity can be measured, whose duration and direction
    can be determined beforehand by hours and distances, ceases to
    be terrifying. It becomes an accepted fact, akin to the
    steam-engine and the electric telegraph, marvelous yet
    commonplace.</p>

    <p>So her ladyship dismissed the topic as of no present
    interest, and focused Miss Deane through her eye-glasses.</p>

    <p>"Sir Arthur proposes to come home in June, I understand?"
    she inquired.</p>

    <p>Iris was a remarkably healthy young woman. A large banana
    momentarily engaged her attention. She nodded affably.</p>

    <p>"You will stay with relatives until he arrives?" pursued
    Lady Tozer.</p>

    <p>The banana is a fruit of simple characteristics. The girl
    was able to reply, with a touch of careless hauteur in her
    voice:</p>

    <p>"Relatives! We have none&mdash;none whom we specially
    cultivate, that is. I will stop in town a day or two to
    interview my dressmaker, and then go straight to Helmdale, our
    place in Yorkshire."</p>

    <p>"Surely you have a chaperon!"</p>

    <p>"A chaperon! My dear Lady Tozer, did my father impress you
    as one who would permit a fussy and stout old person to make my
    life miserable?"</p>

    <p>The acidity of the retort lay in the word "stout." But Iris
    was not accustomed to cross-examination. During a three months'
    residence on the island she had learnt how to avoid Lady Tozer.
    Here it was impossible, and the older woman fastened upon her
    asp-like. Miss Iris Deane was a toothsome morsel for gossip.
    Not yet twenty-one, the only daughter of a wealthy baronet who
    owned a fleet of stately ships&mdash;the <i>Sirdar</i> amongst
    them&mdash;a girl who had been mistress of her father's house
    since her return from Dresden three years ago&mdash;young,
    beautiful, rich&mdash;here was a combination for which men
    thanked a judicious Heaven, whilst women sniffed enviously.</p>

    <p>Business detained Sir Arthur. A war-cloud over-shadowed the
    two great divisions of the yellow race. He must wait to see how
    matters developed, but he would not expose Iris to the
    insidious treachery of a Chinese spring. So, with tears, they
    separated. She was confided to the personal charge of Captain
    Ross. At each point of call the company's agents would be
    solicitous for her welfare. The cable's telegraphic eye would
    watch her progress as that of some princely maiden sailing in
    royal caravel. This fair, slender, well-formed
    girl&mdash;delightfully English in face and figure&mdash;with
    her fresh, clear complexion, limpid blue eyes, and shining
    brown hair, was a personage of some importance.</p>

    <p>Lady Tozer knew these things and sighed complacently.</p>

    <p>"Ah, well," she resumed. "Parents had different views when I
    was a girl. But I assume Sir Arthur thinks you should become
    used to being your own mistress in view of your approaching
    marriage."</p>

    <p>"My&mdash;approaching&mdash;marriage!" cried Iris, now
    genuinely amazed.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Is it not true that you are going to marry Lord
    Ventnor?"</p>

    <p>A passing steward heard the point-blank question.</p>

    <p>It had a curious effect upon him. He gazed with fiercely
    eager eyes at Miss Deane, and so far forgot himself as to
    permit a dish of water ice to rest against Sir John Tozer's
    bald head.</p>

    <p>Iris could not help noting his strange behavior. A flash of
    humor chased away her first angry resentment at Lady Tozer's
    interrogatory.</p>

    <p>"That may be my happy fate," she answered gaily, "but Lord
    Ventnor has not asked me."</p>

    <p>"Every one says in Hong Kong&mdash;" began her ladyship.</p>

    <p>"Confound you, you stupid rascal! what are you doing?"
    shouted Sir John. His feeble nerves at last conveyed the
    information that something more pronounced than a sudden
    draught affected his scalp; the ice was melting.</p>

    <p>The incident amused those passengers who sat near enough to
    observe it. But the chief steward, hovering watchful near the
    captain's table, darted forward. Pale with anger he
    hissed&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Report yourself for duty in the second saloon tonight," and
    he hustled his subordinate away from the judge's chair.</p>

    <p>Miss Deane, mirthfully radiant, rose.</p>

    <p>"Please don't punish the man, Mr. Jones," she said sweetly.
    "It was a sheer accident. He was taken by surprise. In his
    place I would have emptied the whole dish."</p>

    <p>The chief steward smirked. He did not know exactly what had
    happened; nevertheless, great though Sir John Tozer might be,
    the owner's daughter was greater.</p>

    <p>"Certainly, miss, certainly," he agreed, adding
    confidentially:&mdash;"It <i>is</i> rather hard on a steward to
    be sent aft, miss. It makes such a difference in
    the&mdash;er&mdash;the little gratuities given by the
    passengers."</p>

    <p>The girl was tactful. She smiled comprehension at the
    official and bent over Sir John, now carefully polishing the
    back of his skull with a table napkin.</p>

    <p>"I am sure you will forgive him," she whispered. "I can't
    say why, but the poor fellow was looking so intently at me that
    he did not see what he was doing."</p>

    <p>The ex-Chief Justice was instantly mollified. He did not
    mind the application of ice in that way&mdash;rather liked it,
    in fact&mdash;probably ice was susceptible to the fire in Miss
    Deane's eyes.</p>

    <p>Lady Tozer was not so easily appeased. When Iris left the
    saloon she inquired tartly: "How is it, John, that Government
    makes a ship-owner a baronet and a Chief Justice only a
    knight?"</p>

    <p>"That question would provide an interesting subject for
    debate at the Carlton, my dear," he replied with equal
    asperity.</p>

    <p>Suddenly the passengers still seated experienced a prolonged
    sinking sensation, as if the vessel had been converted into a
    gigantic lift. They were pressed hard into their chairs, which
    creaked and tried to swing round on their pivots. As the ship
    yielded stiffly to the sea a whiff of spray dashed through an
    open port.</p>

    <p>"There," snapped her ladyship, "I knew we should run into a
    storm, yet Captain Ross led us to believe&mdash;&mdash; John,
    take me to my cabin at once."</p>

    <p>From the promenade deck the listless groups watched the
    rapid advance of the gale. There was mournful speculation upon
    the <i>Sirdar's</i> chances of reaching Singapore before the
    next evening.</p>

    <p>"We had two hundred and ninety-eight miles to do at noon,"
    said Experience. "If the wind and sea catch us on the port bow
    the ship will pitch awfully. Half the time the screw will be
    racing. I once made this trip in the <i>Sumatra</i>, and we
    were struck by a south-east typhoon in this locality. How long
    do you think it was before we dropped anchor in Singapore
    harbor?"</p>

    <p>No one hazarded a guess.</p>

    <p>"Three days!" Experience was solemnly pompous. "Three whole
    days. They were like three years. By Jove! I never want to see
    another gale like that."</p>

    <p>A timid lady ventured to say&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Perhaps this may not be a typhoon. It may only be a little
    bit of a storm."</p>

    <p>Her sex saved her from a jeer. Experience gloomily shook his
    head.</p>

    <p>"The barometer resists your plea," he said. "I fear there
    will be a good many empty saddles in the saloon at dinner."</p>

    <p>The lady smiled weakly. It was a feeble joke at the best.
    "You think we are in for a sort of marine steeple-chase?" she
    asked.</p>

    <p>"Well, thank Heaven, I had a good lunch," sniggered a
    rosy-faced subaltern, and a ripple of laughter greeted his
    enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>Iris stood somewhat apart from the speakers. The wind had
    freshened and her hat was tied closely over her ears. She
    leaned against the taffrail, enjoying the cool breeze after
    hours of sultry heat. The sky was cloudless yet, but there was
    a queer tinge of burnished copper in the all-pervading
    sunshine. The sea was coldly blue. The life had gone out of it.
    It was no longer inviting and translucent. That morning, were
    such a thing practicable, she would have gladly dived into its
    crystal depths and disported herself like a frolicsome mermaid.
    Now something akin to repulsion came with the fanciful
    remembrance.</p>

    <p>Long sullen undulations swept noiselessly past the ship.
    Once, after a steady climb up a rolling hill of water, the
    <i>Sirdar</i> quickly pecked at the succeeding valley, and the
    propeller gave a couple of angry flaps on the surface, whilst a
    tremor ran through the stout iron rails on which the girl's
    arms rested.</p>

    <p>The crew were busy too. Squads of Lascars raced about,
    industriously obedient to the short shrill whistling of
    jemadars and quartermasters. Boat lashings were tested and
    tightened, canvas awnings stretched across the deck forward,
    ventilator cowls twisted to new angles, and hatches clamped
    down over the wooden gratings that covered the holds. Officers,
    spotless in white linen, flitted quietly to and fro. When the
    watch was changed. Iris noted that the "chief" appeared in an
    old blue suit and carried oilskins over his arm as he climbed
    to the bridge.</p>

    <p>Nature looked disturbed and fitful, and the ship responded
    to her mood. There was a sense of preparation in the air, of
    coming ordeal, of restless foreboding. Chains clanked with a
    noise the girl never noticed before; the tramp of hurrying men
    on the hurricane deck overhead sounded heavy and hollow. There
    was a squeaking of chairs that was abominable when people
    gathered up books and wraps and staggered ungracefully towards
    the companion-way. Altogether Miss Deane was not wholly pleased
    with the preliminaries of a typhoon, whatever the realities
    might be.</p>

    <p>And then, why did gales always spring up at the close of
    day? Could they not start after breakfast, rage with furious
    grandeur during lunch, and die away peacefully at dinner-time,
    permitting one to sleep in comfort without that straining and
    groaning of the ship which seemed to imply a sharp attack of
    rheumatism in every joint?</p>

    <p>Why did that silly old woman allude to her contemplated
    marriage to Lord Ventnor, retailing the gossip of Hong Kong
    with such malicious emphasis? For an instant Iris tried to
    shake the railing in comic anger. She hated Lord Ventnor. She
    did not want to marry him, or anybody else, just yet. Of course
    her father had hinted approval of his lordship's obvious
    intentions. Countess of Ventnor! Yes, it was a nice title.
    Still, she wanted another couple of years of careless freedom;
    in any event, why should Lady Tozer pry and probe?</p>

    <p>And finally, why did the steward&mdash;oh, poor old Sir
    John! What <i>would</i> have happened if the ice had slid down
    his neck? Thoroughly comforted by this gleeful hypothesis, Miss
    Deane seized a favorable opportunity to dart across to the
    starboard side and see if Captain Ross's "heavy bank of cloud
    in the north-west" had put in an appearance.</p>

    <p>Ha! there it was, black, ominous, gigantic, rolling up over
    the horizon like some monstrous football. Around it the sky
    deepened into purple, fringed with a wide belt of brick red.
    She had never seen such a beginning of a gale. From what she
    had read in books she imagined that only in great deserts were
    clouds of dust generated. There could not be dust in the dense
    pall now rushing with giant strides across the trembling sea.
    Then what was it? Why was it so dark and menacing? And where
    was desert of stone and sand to compare with this awful expanse
    of water? What a small dot was this great ship on the visible
    surface! But the ocean itself extended away beyond there,
    reaching out to the infinite. The dot became a mere speck,
    undistinguishable beneath a celestial microscope such as the
    gods might condescend to use.</p>

    <p>Iris shivered and aroused herself with a startled laugh.</p>

    <p>A nice book in a sheltered corner, and perhaps forty winks
    until tea-time&mdash;surely a much more sensible proceeding
    than to stand there, idly conjuring up phantoms of
    affright.</p>

    <p>The lively fanfare of the dinner trumpet failed to fill the
    saloon. By this time the <i>Sirdar</i> was fighting resolutely
    against a stiff gale. But the stress of actual combat was
    better than the eerie sensation of impending danger during the
    earlier hours. The strong, hearty pulsations of the engines,
    the regular thrashing of the screw, the steadfast onward
    plunging of the good ship through racing seas and flying scud,
    were cheery, confident, and inspiring.</p>

    <p>Miss Deane justified her boast that she was an excellent
    sailor. She smiled delightedly at the ship's surgeon when he
    caught her eye through the many gaps in the tables. She was
    alone, so he joined her.</p>

    <p>"You are a credit to the company&mdash;quite a sea-king's
    daughter," he said.</p>

    <p>"Doctor, do you talk to all your lady passengers in that
    way?"</p>

    <p>"Alas, no! Too often I can only be truthful when I am
    dumb."</p>

    <p>Iris laughed. "If I remain long on this ship I will
    certainly have my head turned," she cried. "I receive nothing
    but compliments from the captain down to&mdash;to&mdash;</p>

    <p>"The doctor!"</p>

    <p>"No. You come a good second on the list."</p>

    <p>In very truth she was thinking of the ice-carrying steward
    and his queer start of surprise at the announcement of her
    rumored engagement. The man interested her. He looked like a
    broken-down gentleman. Her quick eyes traveled around the
    saloon to discover his whereabouts. She could not see him. The
    chief steward stood near, balancing himself in apparent
    defiance of the laws of gravitation, for the ship was now
    pitching and rolling with a mad zeal. For an instant she meant
    to inquire what had become of the transgressor, but she
    dismissed the thought at its inception. The matter was too
    trivial.</p>

    <p>With a wild swoop all the plates, glasses, and cutlery on
    the saloon tables crashed to starboard. Were it not for the
    restraint of the fiddles everything must have been swept to the
    floor. There were one or two minor accidents. A steward, taken
    unawares, was thrown headlong on top of his laden tray. Others
    were compelled to clutch the backs of chairs and cling to
    pillars. One man involuntarily seized the hair of a lady who
    devoted an hour before each meal to her coiffure. The
    <i>Sirdar</i>, with a frenzied bound, tried to turn a
    somersault.</p>

    <p>"A change of course," observed the doctor. "They generally
    try to avoid it when people are in the saloon, but a typhoon
    admits of no labored politeness. As its center is now right
    ahead we are going on the starboard tack to get behind it."</p>

    <p>"I must hurry up and go on deck," said Miss Deane.</p>

    <p>"You will not be able to go on deck until the morning."</p>

    <p>She turned on him impetuously. "Indeed I will. Captain Ross
    promised me&mdash;that is, I asked him&mdash;"</p>

    <p>The doctor smiled. She was so charmingly insistent. "It is
    simply impossible," he said. "The companion doors are bolted.
    The promenade deck is swept by heavy seas every minute. A boat
    has been carried away and several stanchions snapped off like
    carrots. For the first time in your life, Miss Deane, you are
    battened down."</p>

    <p>The girl's face must have paled somewhat. He added hastily,
    "There is no danger, you know, but these precautions are
    necessary. You would not like to see several tons of water
    rushing down the saloon stairs; now, would you?"</p>

    <p>"Decidedly not." Then after a pause, "It is not pleasant to
    be fastened up in a great iron box, doctor. It reminds one of a
    huge coffin."</p>

    <p>"Not a bit. The <i>Sirdar</i> is the safest ship afloat.
    Your father has always pursued a splendid policy in that
    respect. The London and Hong Kong Company may not possess fast
    vessels, but they are seaworthy and well found in every
    respect."</p>

    <p>"Are there many people ill on board?"</p>

    <p>"No; just the usual number of disturbed livers. We had a
    nasty accident shortly before dinner."</p>

    <p>"Good gracious! What happened?"</p>

    <p>"Some Lascars were caught by a sea forward. One man had his
    leg broken."</p>

    <p>"Anything else?"</p>

    <p>The doctor hesitated. He became interested in the color of
    some Burgundy. "I hardly know the exact details yet," he
    replied. "Tomorrow after breakfast I will tell you all about
    it."</p>

    <p>An English quartermaster and four Lascars had been licked
    from off the forecastle by the greedy tongue of a huge wave.
    The succeeding surge flung the five men back against the
    quarter. One of the black sailors was pitched aboard, with a
    fractured leg and other injuries. The others were smashed
    against the iron hull and disappeared.</p>

    <p>For one tremulous moment the engines slowed. The ship
    commenced to veer off into the path of the cyclone. Captain
    Ross set his teeth, and the telegraph bell jangled "Full speed
    ahead."</p>

    <p>"Poor Jackson!" he murmured. "One of my best men. I remember
    seeing his wife, a pretty little woman, and two children coming
    to meet him last homeward trip. They will be there again. Good
    God! That Lascar who was saved has some one to await him in a
    Bombay village, I suppose."</p>

    <p>The gale sang a mad requiem to its victims. The very surface
    was torn from the sea. The ship drove relentlessly through
    sheets of spray that caused the officers high up on the bridge
    to gasp for breath. They held on by main force, though
    protected by strong canvas sheets bound to the rails. The main
    deck was quite impassable. The promenade deck, even the lofty
    spar deck, was scourged with the broken crests of waves that
    tried with demoniac energy to smash in the starboard bow, for
    the <i>Sirdar</i> was cutting into the heart of the
    cyclone.</p>

    <p>The captain fought his way to the charthouse. He wiped the
    salt water from his eyes and looked anxiously at the
    barometer.</p>

    <p>"Still falling!" he muttered. "I will keep on until seven
    o'clock and then bear three points to the southward. By
    midnight we should be behind it."</p>

    <p>He struggled back into the outside fury. By comparison the
    sturdy citadel he quitted was Paradise on the edge of an
    inferno.</p>

    <p>Down in the saloon the hardier passengers were striving to
    subdue the ennui of an interval before they sought their
    cabins. Some talked. One hardened reprobate strummed the piano.
    Others played cards, chess, draughts, anything that would
    distract attention.</p>

    <p>The stately apartment offered strange contrast to the
    warring elements without. Bright lights, costly upholstery,
    soft carpets, carved panels and gilded cornices, with uniformed
    attendants passing to and fro carrying coffee and
    glasses&mdash;these surroundings suggested a floating palace in
    which the raging seas were defied. Yet forty miles away,
    somewhere in the furious depths, four corpses swirled about
    with horrible uncertainty, lurching through battling currents,
    and perchance convoyed by fighting sharks.</p>

    <p>The surgeon had been called away. Iris was the only lady
    left in the saloon. She watched a set of whist players for a
    time and then essayed the perilous passage to her stateroom.
    She found her maid and a stewardess there. Both women were
    weeping.</p>

    <p>"What is the matter?" she inquired.</p>

    <p>The stewardess tried to speak. She choked with grief and
    hastily went out. The maid blubbered an explanation.</p>

    <p>"A friend of hers was married, miss, to the man who is
    drowned."</p>

    <p>"Drowned! What man?"</p>

    <p>"Haven't you heard, miss? I suppose they are keeping it
    quiet. An English sailor and some natives were swept off the
    ship by a sea. One native was saved, but he is all smashed up.
    The others were never seen again."</p>

    <p>Iris by degrees learnt the sad chronicles of the Jackson
    family. She was moved to tears. She remembered the doctor's
    hesitancy, and her own idle phrase&mdash;"a huge coffin."</p>

    <p>Outside the roaring waves pounded upon the iron walls.</p>

    <p>Were they not satiated? This tragedy had taken all the
    grandeur out of the storm. It was no longer a majestic phase of
    nature's power, but an implacable demon, bellowing for a
    sacrifice. And that poor woman, with her two children,
    hopefully scanning the shipping lists for news of the great
    steamer, news which, to her, meant only the safety of her
    husband. Oh, it was pitiful!</p>

    <p>Iris would not be undressed. The maid sniveled a request to
    be allowed to remain with her mistress. She would lie on a
    couch until morning.</p>

    <p>Two staterooms had been converted into one to provide Miss
    Deane with ample accommodation. There were no bunks, but a cozy
    bed was screwed to the deck. She lay down, and strove to read.
    It was a difficult task. Her eyes wandered from the printed
    page to mark the absurd antics of her garments swinging on
    their hooks. At times the ship rolled so far that she felt sure
    it must topple over. She was not afraid; but subdued, rather
    astonished, placidly prepared for vague eventualities. Through
    it all she wondered why she clung to the belief that in another
    day or two the storm would be forgotten, and people playing
    quoits on deck, dancing, singing coon songs in the music-room,
    or grumbling at the heat.</p>

    <p>Things were ridiculous. What need was there for all this
    external fury? Why should poor sailors be cast forth to instant
    death in such awful manner? If she could only sleep and
    forget&mdash;if kind oblivion would blot out the storm for a
    few blissful hours! But how could one sleep with the
    consciousness of that watery giant thundering his summons upon
    the iron plates a few inches away?</p>

    <p>Then came the blurred picture of Captain Ross high up on the
    bridge, peering into the moving blackness. How strange that
    there should be hidden in the convolutions of a man's brain an
    intelligence that laid bare the pretences of that ravenous
    demon without. Each of the ship's officers, the commander more
    than the others, understood the why and the wherefore of this
    blustering combination of wind and sea. Iris knew the language
    of poker. Nature was putting up a huge bluff.</p>

    <p>What was it the captain said in his little lecture? "When a
    ship meets a cyclone north of the equator on a westerly course
    she nearly always has the wind at first on the port side, but,
    owing to the revolution of the gale, when she passes its center
    the wind is on the starboard side."</p>

    <p>Yes, that was right, as far as the first part was concerned.
    Evidently they had not yet passed the central path. Oh, dear!
    She was so tired. It demanded a physical effort to constantly
    shove away an unseen force that tried to push you over. How
    funny that a big cloud should travel up against the wind! And
    so, amidst confused wonderment, she lapsed into an uneasy
    slumber, her last sentient thought being a quiet thankfulness
    that the screw went thud-thud, thud-thud with such firm
    determination.</p>

    <p>After the course was changed and the <i>Sirdar</i> bore away
    towards the south-west, the commander consulted the barometer
    each half-hour. The tell-tale mercury had sunk over two inches
    in twelve hours. The abnormally low pressure quickly created
    dense clouds which enhanced the melancholy darkness of the
    gale.</p>

    <p>For many minutes together the bows of the ship were not
    visible. Masthead and sidelights were obscured by the pelting
    scud. The engines thrust the vessel forward like a lance into
    the vitals of the storm. Wind and wave gushed out of the vortex
    with impotent fury.</p>

    <p>At last, soon after midnight, the barometer showed a slight
    upward movement. At 1.30 a.m. the change became pronounced;
    simultaneously the wind swung round a point to the
    westward.</p>

    <p>Then Captain Ross smiled wearily. His face brightened. He
    opened his oilskin coat, glanced at the compass, and nodded
    approval.</p>

    <p>"That's right," he shouted to the quartermaster at the
    steam-wheel. "Keep her steady there, south 15 west."</p>

    <p>"South 15 west it is, sir," yelled the sailor, impassively
    watching the moving disk, for the wind alteration necessitated
    a little less help from the rudder to keep the ship's head true
    to her course.</p>

    <p>Captain Ross ate some sandwiches and washed them down with
    cold tea. He was more hungry than he imagined, having spent
    eleven hours without food. The tea was insipid. He called
    through a speaking-tube for a further supply of sandwiches and
    some coffee.</p>

    <p>Then he turned to consult a chart. He was joined by the
    chief officer. Both men examined the chart in silence.</p>

    <p>Captain Ross finally took a pencil. He stabbed its point on
    the paper in the neighborhood of 14&deg; N. and 112&deg; E.</p>

    <p>"We are about there, I think."</p>

    <p>The chief agreed. "That was the locality I had in my mind."
    He bent closer over the sheet.</p>

    <p>"Nothing in the way tonight, sir," he added.</p>

    <p>"Nothing whatever. It is a bit of good luck to meet such
    weather here. We can keep as far south as we like until
    daybreak, and by that time&mdash;How did it look when you came
    in?"</p>

    <p>"A trifle better, I think."</p>

    <p>"I have sent for some refreshments. Let us have another
    <i>dekko</i><a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
       "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> before we tackle them."</p>

    <p>The two officers passed out into the hurricane. Instantly
    the wind endeavored to tear the charthouse from off the deck.
    They looked aloft and ahead. The officer on duty saw them and
    nodded silent comprehension. It was useless to attempt to
    speak. The weather was perceptibly clearer.</p>

    <p>Then all three peered ahead again. They stood, pressing
    against the wind, seeking to penetrate the murkiness in front.
    Suddenly they were galvanized into strenuous activity.</p>

    <p>A wild howl came from the lookout forward. The eyes of the
    three men glared at a huge dismasted Chinese junk, wallowing
    helplessly in the trough of the sea, dead under the bows.</p>

    <p>The captain sprang to the charthouse and signaled in fierce
    pantomime that the wheel should be put hard over.</p>

    <p>The officer in charge of the bridge pressed the telegraph
    lever to "stop" and "full speed astern," whilst with his
    disengaged hand he pulled hard at the siren cord, and a raucous
    warning sent stewards flying through the ship to close
    collision bulkhead doors. The "chief" darted to the port rail,
    for the <i>Sirdar's</i> instant response to the helm seemed to
    clear her nose from the junk as if by magic.</p>

    <p>It all happened so quickly that whilst the hoarse signal was
    still vibrating through the ship, the junk swept past her
    quarter. The chief officer, joined now by the commander, looked
    down into the wretched craft. They could see her crew lashed in
    a bunch around the capstan on her elevated poop. She was laden
    with timber. Although water-logged, she could not sink if she
    held together.</p>

    <p>A great wave sucked her away from the steamer and then
    hurled her back with irresistible force. The <i>Sirdar</i> was
    just completing her turning movement, and she heeled over,
    yielding to the mighty power of the gale. For an appreciable
    instant her engines stopped. The mass of water that swayed the
    junk like a cork lifted the great ship high by the stern. The
    propeller began to revolve in air&mdash;for the third officer
    had corrected his signal to "full speed ahead" again&mdash;and
    the cumbrous Chinese vessel struck the <i>Sirdar</i> a terrible
    blow in the counter, smashing off the screw close to the
    thrust-block and wrenching the rudder from its bearings.</p>

    <p>There was an awful race by the engines before the engineers
    could shut off steam. The junk vanished into the wilderness of
    noise and tumbling seas beyond, and the fine steamer of a few
    seconds ago, replete with magnificent energy, struggled like a
    wounded leviathan in the grasp of a vengeful foe.</p>

    <p>She swung round, as if in wrath, to pursue the puny
    assailant which had dealt her this mortal stroke. No longer
    breasting the storm with stubborn persistency, she now drifted
    aimlessly before wind and wave. She was merely a larger
    plaything, tossed about by Titantic gambols. The junk was burst
    asunder by the collision. Her planks and cargo littered the
    waves, were even tossed in derision on to the decks of the
    <i>Sirdar</i>. Of what avail was strong timber or bolted iron
    against the spleen of the unchained and formless monster who
    loudly proclaimed his triumph? The great steamship drifted on
    through chaos. The typhoon had broken the lance.</p>

    <p>But brave men, skilfully directed, wrought hard to avert
    further disaster. After the first moment of stupor, gallant
    British sailors risked life and limb to bring the vessel under
    control.</p>

    <p>By their calm courage they shamed the paralyzed Lascars into
    activity. A sail was rigged on the foremast, and a sea anchor
    hastily constructed as soon as it was discovered that the helm
    was useless. Rockets flared up into the sky at regular
    intervals, in the faint hope that should they attract the
    attention of another vessel she would follow the disabled
    <i>Sirdar</i> and render help when the weather moderated.</p>

    <p>When the captain ascertained that no water was being
    shipped, the damage being wholly external, the collision doors
    were opened and the passengers admitted to the saloon, a
    brilliant palace, superbly indifferent to the wreck and ruin
    without.</p>

    <p>Captain Ross himself came down and addressed a few
    comforting words to the quiet men and pallid women gathered
    there. He told them exactly what had happened.</p>

    <p>Sir John Tozer, self-possessed and critical, asked a
    question.</p>

    <p>"The junk is destroyed, I assume?" he said.</p>

    <p>"It is."</p>

    <p>"Would it not have been better to have struck her end
    on?"</p>

    <p>"Much better, but that is not the view we should take if we
    encountered a vessel relatively as big as the <i>Sirdar</i> was
    to the unfortunate junk."</p>

    <p>"But," persisted the lawyer, "what would have been the
    result?"</p>

    <p>"You would never have known that the incident had happened,
    Sir John."</p>

    <p>"In other words, the poor despairing Chinamen, clinging to
    their little craft with some chance of escape, would be quietly
    murdered to suit our convenience."</p>

    <p>It was Iris's clear voice that rang out this downright
    exposition of the facts. Sir John shook his head; he carried
    the discussion no further.</p>

    <p>The hours passed in tedious misery after Captain Ross's
    visit. Every one was eager to get a glimpse of the unknown
    terrors without from the deck. This was out of the question, so
    people sat around the tables to listen eagerly to Experience
    and his wise saws on drifting ships and their prospects.</p>

    <p>Some cautious persons visited their cabins to secure
    valuables in case of further disaster. A few hardy spirits
    returned to bed.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in the charthouse, the captain and chief officer
    were gravely pondering over an open chart, and discussing a
    fresh risk that loomed ominously before them. The ship was a
    long way out of her usual course when the accident happened.
    She was drifting now, they estimated, eleven knots an hour,
    with wind, sea, and current all forcing her in the same
    direction, drifting into one of the most dangerous places in
    the known world, the south China Sea, with its numberless
    reefs, shoals, and isolated rocks, and the great island of
    Borneo stretching right across the path of the cyclone.</p>

    <p>Still, there was nothing to be done save to make a few
    unobtrusive preparations and trust to idle chance. To attempt
    to anchor and ride out the gale in their present position was
    out of the question.</p>

    <p>Two, three, four o'clock came, and went. Another half-hour
    would witness the dawn and a further clearing of the weather.
    The barometer was rapidly rising. The center of the cyclone had
    swept far ahead. There was only left the aftermath of heavy
    seas and furious but steadier wind.</p>

    <p>Captain Ross entered the charthouse for the twentieth
    time.</p>

    <p>He had aged many years in appearance. The smiling,
    confident, debonair officer was changed into a stricken,
    mournful man. He had altered with his ship. The <i>Sirdar</i>
    and her master could hardly be recognized, so cruel were the
    blows they had received.</p>

    <p>"It is impossible to see a yard ahead," he confided to his
    second in command. "I have never been so anxious before in my
    life. Thank God the night is drawing to a close. Perhaps, when
    day breaks&mdash;"</p>

    <p>His last words contained a prayer and a hope. Even as he
    spoke the ship seemed to lift herself bodily with an unusual
    effort for a vessel moving before the wind.</p>

    <p>The next instant there was a horrible grinding crash
    forward. Each person who did not chance to be holding fast to
    an upright was thrown violently down. The deck was tilted to a
    dangerous angle and remained there, whilst the heavy buffeting
    of the sea, now raging afresh at this unlooked-for resistance,
    drowned the despairing yells raised by the Lascars on duty.</p>

    <p>The <i>Sirdar</i> had completed her last voyage. She was now
    a battered wreck on a barrier reef. She hung thus for one
    heart-breaking second. Then another wave, riding triumphantly
    through its fellows, caught the great steamer in its tremendous
    grasp, carried her onward for half her length and smashed her
    down on the rocks. Her back was broken. She parted in two
    halves. Both sections turned completely over in the utter
    wantonness of destruction, and everything&mdash;masts, funnels,
    boats, hull, with every living soul on board&mdash;was at once
    engulfed in a maelstrom of rushing water and far-flung
    spray.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

    <h2>THE SURVIVORS</h2>

    <p>When the <i>Sirdar</i> parted amidships, the floor of the
    saloon heaved up in the center with a mighty crash of rending
    woodwork and iron. Men and women, too stupefied to sob out a
    prayer, were pitched headlong into chaos. Iris, torn from the
    terrified grasp of her maid, fell through a corridor, and would
    have gone down with the ship had not a sailor, clinging to a
    companion ladder, caught her as she whirled along the steep
    slope of the deck.</p>

    <p>He did not know what had happened. With the instinct of
    self-preservation he seized the nearest support when the vessel
    struck. It was the mere impulse of ready helpfulness that
    caused him to stretch out his left arm and clasp the girl's
    waist as she fluttered past. By idle chance they were on the
    port side, and the ship, after pausing for one awful second,
    fell over to starboard.</p>

    <p>The man was not prepared for this second gyration. Even as
    the stairway canted he lost his balance; they were both thrown
    violently through the open hatchway, and swept off into the
    boiling surf. Under such conditions thought itself was
    impossible. A series of impressions, a number of fantastic
    pictures, were received by the benumbed faculties, and
    afterwards painfully sorted out by the memory. Fear, anguish,
    amazement&mdash;none of these could exist. All he knew was that
    the lifeless form of a woman&mdash;for Iris had happily
    fainted&mdash;must be held until death itself wrenched her from
    him. Then there came the headlong plunge into the swirling sea,
    followed by an indefinite period of gasping oblivion. Something
    that felt like a moving rock rose up beneath his feet. He was
    driven clear out of the water and seemed to recognize a
    familiar object rising rigid and bright close at hand. It was
    the binnacle pillar, screwed to a portion of the deck which
    came away from the charthouse and was rent from the upper
    framework by contact with the reef.</p>

    <p>He seized this unlooked-for support with his disengaged
    hand. For one fleet instant he had a confused vision of the
    destruction of the ship. Both the fore and aft portions were
    burst asunder by the force of compressed air. Wreckage and
    human forms were tossing about foolishly. The sea pounded upon
    the opposing rocks with the noise of ten thousand mighty
    steam-hammers.</p>

    <p>A uniformed figure&mdash;he thought it was the
    captain&mdash;stretched out an unavailing arm to clasp the
    queer raft which supported the sailor and the girl. But a
    jealous wave rose under the platform with devilish energy and
    turned it completely over, hurling the man with his inanimate
    burthen into the depths. He rose, fighting madly for his life.
    Now surely he was doomed! But again, as if human existence
    depended on naught more serious than the spinning of a coin,
    his knees rested on the same few staunch timbers, now the
    ceiling of the music-room, and he was given a brief respite.
    His greatest difficulty was to get his breath, so dense was the
    spray through which he was driven. Even in that terrible moment
    he kept his senses. The girl, utterly unconscious, showed by
    the convulsive heaving of her breast that she was choking. With
    a wild effort he swung her head round to shield her from the
    flying scud with his own form.</p>

    <p>The tiny air-space thus provided gave her some relief, and
    in that instant the sailor seemed to recognize her. He was not
    remotely capable of a definite idea. Just as he vaguely
    realized the identity of the woman in his arms the unsteady
    support on which he rested toppled over. Again he renewed the
    unequal contest. A strong resolute man and a typhoon sea
    wrestled for supremacy.</p>

    <p>This time his feet plunged against something gratefully
    solid. He was dashed forward, still battling with the raging
    turmoil of water, and a second time he felt the same firm yet
    smooth surface. His dormant faculties awoke. It was sand. With
    frenzied desperation, buoyed now by the inspiring hope of
    safety, he fought his way onwards like a maniac.</p>

    <p>Often he fell, three times did the backwash try to drag him
    to the swirling death behind, but he staggered blindly on, on,
    until even the tearing gale ceased to be laden with the
    suffocating foam, and his faltering feet sank in deep soft
    white sand.</p>

    <p class="figcenter"><a href="images/wm_2_1.png"><img alt=

    <p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">With frenzied
    desperation, buoyed now by the inspiring hope of safety, he
    fought his way onward like a maniac.</span></p>

    <p>Then he fell, not to rise again. With a last weak flicker of
    exhausted strength he drew the girl closely to him, and the two
    lay, clasped tightly together, heedless now of all things.</p>

    <p>How long the man remained prostrate he could only guess
    subsequently. The <i>Sirdar</i> struck soon after daybreak and
    the sailor awoke to a hazy consciousness of his surroundings to
    find a shaft of sunshine flickering through the clouds banked
    up in the east. The gale was already passing away. Although the
    wind still whistled with shrill violence it was more blustering
    than threatening. The sea, too, though running very high, had
    retreated many yards from the spot where he had finally
    dropped, and its surface was no longer scourged with venomous
    spray.</p>

    <p>Slowly and painfully he raised himself to a sitting posture,
    for he was bruised and stiff. With his first movement he became
    violently ill. He had swallowed much salt water, and it was not
    until the spasm of sickness had passed that he thought of the
    girl.</p>

    <p>She had slipped from his breast as he rose, and was lying,
    face downwards, in the sand. The memory of much that had
    happened surged into his brain with horrifying suddenness.</p>

    <p>"She cannot be dead," he hoarsely murmured, feebly trying to
    lift her. "Surely Providence would not desert her after such an
    escape. What a weak beggar I must be to give in at the last
    moment. I am sure she was living when we got ashore. What on
    earth can I do to revive her?"</p>

    <p>Forgetful of his own aching limbs in this newborn anxiety,
    he sank on one knee and gently pillowed Iris's head and
    shoulders on the other. Her eyes were closed, her lips and
    teeth firmly set&mdash;a fact to which she undoubtedly owed her
    life, else she would have been suffocated&mdash;and the pallor
    of her skin seemed to be that terrible bloodless hue which
    indicates death. The stern lines in the man's face relaxed, and
    something blurred his vision. He was weak from exhaustion and
    want of food. For the moment his emotions were easily
    aroused.</p>

    <p>"Oh, it is pitiful," he almost whimpered. "It cannot
    be!"</p>

    <p>With a gesture of despair he drew the sleeve of his thick
    jersey across his eyes to clear them from the gathering mist.
    Then he tremblingly endeavored to open the neck of her dress
    and unclasp her corsets. He had a vague notion that ladies in a
    fainting condition required such treatment, and he was
    desperately resolved to bring Iris Deane back to conscious
    existence if it were possible. His task was rendered difficult
    by the waistband of her dress. He slipped out a clasp-knife and
    opened the blade.</p>

    <p>Not until then did he discover that the nail of the
    forefinger on his right hand had been torn out by the quick,
    probably during his endeavors to grasp the unsteady support
    which contributed so materially to his escape. It still hung by
    a shred and hindered the free use of his hand. Without any
    hesitation he seized the offending nail in his teeth and
    completed the surgical operation by a rapid jerk.</p>

    <p>Bending to resume his task he was startled to find the
    girl's eyes wide open and surveying him with shadowy alarm. She
    was quite conscious, absurdly so in a sense, and had noticed
    his strange action.</p>

    <p>"Thank God!" he cried hoarsely. "You are alive."</p>

    <p>Her mind as yet could only work in a single groove.</p>

    <p>"Why did you do that?" she whispered.</p>

    <p>"Do what?"</p>

    <p>"Bite your nail off!"</p>

    <p>"It was in my way. I wished to cut open your dress at the
    waist. You were collapsed, almost dead, I thought, and I wanted
    to unfasten your corsets."</p>

    <p>Her color came back with remarkable rapidity. From all the
    rich variety of the English tongue few words could have been
    selected of such restorative effect.</p>

    <p>She tried to assume a sitting posture, and instinctively her
    hands traveled to her disarranged costume.</p>

    <p>"How ridiculous!" she said, with a little note of annoyance
    in her voice, which sounded curiously hollow. But her brave
    spirit could not yet command her enfeebled frame. She was
    perforce compelled to sink back to the support of his knee and
    arm.</p>

    <p>"Do you think you could lie quiet until I try to find some
    water?" he gasped anxiously.</p>

    <p>She nodded a childlike acquiescence, and her eyelids fell.
    It was only that her eyes smarted dreadfully from the salt
    water, but the sailor was sure that this was a premonition of a
    lapse to unconsciousness.</p>

    <p>"Please try not to faint again," he said. "Don't you think I
    had better loosen these things? You can breathe more
    easily."</p>

    <p>A ghost of a smile flickered on her lips. "No&mdash;no," she
    murmured. "My eyes hurt me&mdash;that is all. Is
    there&mdash;any&mdash;water?"</p>

    <p>He laid her tenderly on the sand and rose to his feet. His
    first glance was towards the sea. He saw something which made
    him blink with astonishment. A heavy sea was still running over
    the barrier reef which enclosed a small lagoon. The contrast
    between the fierce commotion outside and the comparatively
    smooth surface of the protected pool was very marked. At low
    tide the lagoon was almost completely isolated. Indeed, he
    imagined that only a fierce gale blowing from the northwest
    would enable the waves to leap the reef, save where a strip of
    broken water, surging far into the small natural harbor,
    betrayed the position of the tiny entrance.</p>

    <p>Yet at this very point a fine cocoanut palm reared its
    stately column high in air, and its long tremulous fronds were
    now swinging wildly before the gale. From where he stood it
    appeared to be growing in the midst of the sea, for huge
    breakers completely hid the coral embankment. This sentinel of
    the land had a weirdly impressive effect. It was the only fixed
    object in the waste of foam-capped waves. Not a vestige of the
    <i>Sirdar</i> remained seaward, but the sand was littered with
    wreckage, and&mdash;mournful spectacle!&mdash;a considerable
    number of inanimate human forms lay huddled up amidst the
    relics of the steamer.</p>

    <p>This discovery stirred him to action. He turned to survey
    the land on which he was stranded with his helpless companion.
    To his great relief he discovered that it was lofty and
    tree-clad. He knew that the ship could not have drifted to
    Borneo, which still lay far to the south. This must be one of
    the hundreds of islands which stud the China Sea and provide
    resorts for Ha&iuml;nan fishermen. Probably it was inhabited,
    though he thought it strange that none of the islanders had put
    in an appearance. In any event, water and food, of some sort,
    were assured.</p>

    <p>But before setting out upon his quest two things demanded
    attention. The girl must be removed from her present position.
    It would be too horrible to permit her first conscious gaze to
    rest upon those crumpled objects on the beach. Common humanity
    demanded, too, that he should hastily examine each of the
    bodies in case life was not wholly extinct.</p>

    <p>So he bent over the girl, noting with sudden wonder that,
    weak as she was, she had managed to refasten part of her
    bodice.</p>

    <p>"You must permit me to carry you a little further inland,"
    he explained gently.</p>

    <p>Without another word he lifted her in his arms, marveling
    somewhat at the strength which came of necessity, and bore her
    some little distance, until a sturdy rock, jutting out of the
    sand, offered shelter from the wind and protection from the sea
    and its revelations.</p>

    <p>"I am so cold, and tired," murmured Iris. "Is there any
    water? My throat hurts me."</p>

    <p>He pressed back the tangled hair from her forehead as he
    might soothe a child.</p>

    <p>"Try to lie still for a very few minutes," he said.</p>

    <p>"You have not long to suffer. I will return
    immediately."</p>

    <p>His own throat and palate were on fire owing to the brine,
    but he first hurried back to the edge of the lagoon. There were
    fourteen bodies in all, three women and eleven men, four of the
    latter being Lascars. The women were saloon passengers whom he
    did not know. One of the men was the surgeon, another the first
    officer, a third Sir John Tozer. The rest were passengers and
    members of the crew. They were all dead; some had been
    peacefully drowned, others were fearfully mangled by the rocks.
    Two of the Lascars, bearing signs of dreadful injuries, were
    lying on a cluster of low rocks overhanging the water. The
    remainder rested on the sand.</p>

    <p>The sailor exhibited no visible emotion whilst he conducted
    his sad scrutiny. When he was assured that this silent company
    was beyond mortal help he at once strode away towards the
    nearest belt of trees. He could not tell how long the search
    for water might be protracted, and there was pressing need for
    it.</p>

    <p>When he reached the first clump of brushwood he uttered a
    delighted exclamation. There, growing in prodigal luxuriance,
    was the beneficent pitcher-plant, whose large curled-up leaf,
    shaped like a teacup, not only holds a lasting quantity of
    rain-water, but mixes therewith its own palatable and natural
    juices.</p>

    <p>With his knife he severed two of the leaves, swearing
    emphatically the while on account of his damaged finger, and
    hastened to Iris with the precious beverage. She heard him and
    managed to raise herself on an elbow.</p>

    <p>The poor girl's eyes glistened at the prospect of relief.
    Without a word of question or surprise she swallowed the
    contents of both leaves.</p>

    <p>Then she found utterance. "How odd it tastes! What is it?"
    she inquired.</p>

    <p>But the eagerness with which she quenched her thirst renewed
    his own momentarily forgotten torture. His tongue seemed to
    swell. He was absolutely unable to reply.</p>

    <p>The water revived Iris like a magic draught. Her quick
    intuition told her what had happened.</p>

    <p>"You have had none yourself," she cried. "Go at once and get
    some. And please bring me some more."</p>

    <p>He required no second bidding. After hastily gulping down
    the contents of several leaves he returned with a further
    supply. Iris was now sitting up. The sun had burst royally
    through the clouds, and her chilled limbs were gaining some
    degree of warmth and elasticity.</p>

    <p>"What is it?" she repeated after another delicious
    draught.</p>

    <p>"The leaf of the pitcher-plant. Nature is not always cruel.
    In an unusually generous mood she devised this method of
    storing water."</p>

    <p>Miss Deane reached out her hand for more. Her troubled brain
    refused to wonder at such a reply from an ordinary seaman. The
    sailor deliberately spilled the contents of a remaining leaf on
    the sand.</p>

    <p>"No, madam," he said, with an odd mixture of deference and
    firmness. "No more at present. I must first procure you some
    food."</p>

    <p>She looked up at him in momentary silence.</p>

    <p>"The ship is lost?" she said after a pause.</p>

    <p>"Yes, madam."</p>

    <p>"Are we the only people saved?"</p>

    <p>"I fear so."</p>

    <p>"Is this a desert island?"</p>

    <p>"I think not, madam. It may, by chance, be temporarily
    uninhabited, but fishermen from China come to all these places
    to collect tortoise-shell and <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>. I have
    seen no other living beings except ourselves; nevertheless, the
    islanders may live on the south side."</p>

    <p>Another pause. Amidst the thrilling sensations of the moment
    Iris found herself idly speculating as to the meaning of
    <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>, and why this common sailor
    pronounced French so well. Her thoughts reverted to the
    steamer.</p>

    <p>"It surely cannot be possible that the <i>Sirdar</i> has
    gone to pieces&mdash;a magnificent vessel of her size and
    strength?"</p>

    <p>He answered quietly&mdash;"It is too true, madam. I suppose
    you hardly knew she struck, it happened so suddenly.
    Afterwards, fortunately for you, you were unconscious."</p>

    <p>"How do you know?" she inquired quickly. A flood of vivid
    recollection was pouring in upon her.</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;well, I happened to be near you, madam,
    when the ship broke up, and we&mdash;er&mdash;drifted ashore
    together."</p>

    <p>She rose and faced him. "I remember now," she cried
    hysterically. "You caught me as I was thrown into the corridor.
    We fell into the sea when the vessel turned over. You have
    saved my life. Were it not for you I could not possibly have
    escaped."</p>

    <p>She gazed at him more earnestly, seeing that he blushed
    beneath the crust of salt and sand that covered his face.
    "Why," she went on with growing excitement, "you are the
    steward I noticed in the saloon yesterday. How is it that you
    are now dressed as a sailor?"</p>

    <p>He answered readily enough. "There was an accident on board
    during the gale, madam. I am a fair sailor but a poor steward,
    so I applied for a transfer. As the crew were short-handed my
    offer was accepted."</p>

    <p>Iris was now looking at him intently.</p>

    <p>"You saved my life," she repeated slowly. It seemed that
    this obvious fact needed to be indelibly established in her
    mind. Indeed the girl was overwrought by all that she had gone
    through. Only by degrees were her thoughts marshaling
    themselves with lucid coherence. As yet, she recalled so many
    dramatic incidents that they failed to assume due
    proportion.</p>

    <p>But quickly there came memories of Captain Ross, of Sir John
    and Lady Tozer, of the doctor, her maid, the hundred and one
    individualities of her pleasant life aboard ship. Could it be
    that they were all dead? The notion was monstrous. But its
    ghastly significance was instantly borne in upon her by the
    plight in which she stood. Her lips quivered; the tears
    trembled in her eyes.</p>

    <p>"Is it really true that all the ship's company except
    ourselves are lost?" she brokenly demanded.</p>

    <p>The sailor's gravely earnest glance fell before hers.
    "Unhappily there is no room for doubt," he said.</p>

    <p>"Are you quite, quite sure?"</p>

    <p>"I am sure&mdash;of some." Involuntarily he turned
    seawards.</p>

    <p>She understood him. She sank to her knees, covered her face
    with her hands, and broke into a passion of weeping. With a
    look of infinite pity he stooped and would have touched her
    shoulder, but he suddenly restrained the impulse. Something had
    hardened this man. It cost him an effort to be callous, but he
    succeeded. His mouth tightened and his expression lost its
    tenderness.</p>

    <p>"Come, come, my dear lady," he exclaimed, and there was a
    tinge of studied roughness in his voice, "you must calm
    yourself. It is the fortune of shipwreck as well as of war, you
    know. We are alive and must look after ourselves. Those who
    have gone are beyond our help."</p>

    <p>"But not beyond our sympathy," wailed Iris, uncovering her
    swimming eyes for a fleeting look at him. Even in the utter
    desolation of the moment she could not help marveling that this
    queer-mannered sailor, who spoke like a gentleman and tried to
    pose as her inferior, who had rescued her with the utmost
    gallantry, who carried his Quixotic zeal to the point of first
    supplying her needs when he was in far worse case himself,
    should be so utterly indifferent to the fate of others.</p>

    <p>He waited silently until her sobs ceased.</p>

    <p>"Now, madam," he said, "it is essential that we should
    obtain some food. I don't wish to leave you alone until we are
    better acquainted with our whereabouts. Can you walk a little
    way towards the trees, or shall I assist you?"</p>

    <p>Iris immediately stood up. She pressed her hair back
    defiantly.</p>

    <p>"Certainly I can walk," she answered. "What do you propose
    to do?"</p>

    <p>"Well, madam&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"What is your name?" she interrupted imperiously.</p>

    <p>"Jenks, madam. Robert Jenks."</p>

    <p>"Thank you. Now, listen, Mr. Robert Jenks. My name is Miss
    Iris Deane. On board ship I was a passenger and you were a
    steward&mdash;that is, until you became a seaman. Here we are
    equals in misfortune, but in all else you are the
    leader&mdash;I am quite useless. I can only help in matters by
    your direction, so I do not wish to be addressed as 'madam' in
    every breath. Do you understand me?"</p>

    <p>Conscious that her large blue eyes were fixed indignantly
    upon him Mr. Robert Jenks repressed a smile. She was still
    hysterical and must be humored in her vagaries. What an odd
    moment for a discussion on etiquette!</p>

    <p>"As you wish, Miss Deane," he said. "The fact remains that I
    have many things to attend to, and we really must eat
    something."</p>

    <p>"What can we eat?"</p>

    <p>"Let us find out," he replied, scanning the nearest trees
    with keen scrutiny.</p>

    <p>They plodded together through the sand in silence.
    Physically, they were a superb couple, but in raiment they
    resembled scarecrows. Both, of course, were bare-headed. The
    sailor's jersey and trousers were old and torn, and the
    sea-water still soughed loudly in his heavy boots with each
    step.</p>

    <p>But Iris was in a deplorable plight. Her hair fell in a
    great wave of golden brown strands over her neck and shoulders.
    Every hairpin had vanished, but with a few dexterous twists she
    coiled the flying tresses into a loose knot. Her beautiful
    muslin dress was rent and draggled. It was drying rapidly under
    the ever-increasing power of the sun, and she surreptitiously
    endeavored to complete the fastening of the open portion about
    her neck. Other details must be left until a more favorable
    opportunity.</p>

    <p>She recalled the strange sight that first met her eyes when
    she recovered consciousness.</p>

    <p>"You hurt your finger," she said abruptly. "Let me see
    it."</p>

    <p>They had reached the shelter of the trees, pleasantly
    grateful now, so powerful are tropical sunbeams at even an
    early hour.</p>

    <p>He held out his right hand without looking at her. Indeed,
    his eyes had been studiously averted during the past few
    minutes. Her womanly feelings were aroused by the condition of
    the ragged wound.</p>

    <p>"Oh, you poor fellow," she said. "How awful it must be! How
    did it happen? Let me tie it up."</p>

    <p>"It is not so bad now," he said. "It has been well soaked in
    salt water, you know. I think the nail was torn off when
    we&mdash;when a piece of wreckage miraculously turned up
    beneath us."</p>

    <p>Iris shredded a strip from her dress. She bound the finger
    with deft tenderness.</p>

    <p>"Thank you," he said simply. Then he gave a glad shout. "By
    Jove! Miss Deane, we are in luck's way. There is a fine
    plantain tree."</p>

    <p>The pangs of hunger could not be resisted. Although the
    fruit was hardly ripe they tore at the great bunches and ate
    ravenously. Iris made no pretence in the matter, and the sailor
    was in worse plight, for he had been on duty continuously since
    four o'clock the previous afternoon.</p>

    <p>At last their appetite was somewhat appeased, though
    plantains might not appeal to a gourmand as the solitary
    joint.</p>

    <p>"Now," decided Jenks, "you must rest here a little while,
    Miss Deane. I am going back to the beach. You need not be
    afraid. There are no animals to harm you, and I will not be far
    away."</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do on the beach?" she demanded.</p>

    <p>"To rescue stores, for the most part."</p>

    <p>"May I not come with you&mdash;I can be of some little
    service, surely?"</p>

    <p>He answered slowly: "Please oblige me by remaining here at
    present. In less than an hour I will return, and then, perhaps,
    you will find plenty to do."</p>

    <p>She read his meaning intuitively and shivered. "I could not
    do <i>that</i>," she murmured. "I would faint. Whilst you are
    away I will pray for them&mdash;my unfortunate friends."</p>

    <p>As he passed from her side he heard her sobbing quietly.</p>

    <p>When he reached the lagoon he halted suddenly. Something
    startled him. He was quite certain that he had counted fourteen
    corpses. Now there were only twelve. The two Lascars' bodies,
    which rested on the small group of rocks on the verge of the
    lagoon, had vanished.</p>

    <p>Where had they gone to?</p>
    <hr>
    <a name="CHAPTER_III"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

    <h2>DISCOVERIES</h2>

    <p>The sailor wasted no time in idle bewilderment. He searched
    carefully for traces of the missing Lascars. He came to the
    conclusion that the bodies had been dragged from off the
    sun-dried rocks into the lagoon by some agency the nature of
    which he could not even conjecture.</p>

    <p>They were lying many feet above the sea-level when he last
    saw them, little more than half an hour earlier. At that point
    the beach shelved rapidly. He could look far into the depths of
    the rapidly clearing water. Nothing was visible there save
    several varieties of small fish.</p>

    <p>The incident puzzled and annoyed him. Still thinking about
    it, he sat down on the highest rock and pulled off his heavy
    boots to empty the water out. He also divested himself of his
    stockings and spread them out to dry.</p>

    <p>The action reminded him of Miss Deane's necessities. He
    hurried to a point whence he could call out to her and
    recommend her to dry some of her clothing during his absence.
    He retired even more quickly, fearing lest he should be seen.
    Iris had already displayed to the sunlight a large portion of
    her costume.</p>

    <p>Without further delay he set about a disagreeable but
    necessary task. From the pockets of the first officer and
    doctor he secured two revolvers and a supply of cartridges,
    evidently intended to settle any dispute which might have
    arisen between the ship's officers and the native members of
    the crew. He hoped the cartridges were uninjured; but he could
    not test them at the moment for fear of alarming Miss
    Deane.</p>

    <p>Both officers carried pocket-books and pencils. In one of
    these, containing dry leaves, the sailor made a careful
    inventory of the money and other valuable effects he found upon
    the dead, besides noting names and documents where possible.
    Curiously enough, the capitalist of this island morgue was a
    Lascar jemadar, who in a belt around his waist hoarded more
    than one hundred pounds in gold. The sailor tied in a
    handkerchief all the money he collected, and ranged
    pocket-books, letters, and jewelry in separate little heaps.
    Then he stripped the men of their boots and outer clothing. He
    could not tell how long the girl and he might be detained on
    the island before help came, and fresh garments were essential.
    It would be foolish sentimentality to trust to stores thrown
    ashore from the ship.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, when it became necessary to search and disrobe
    the women he almost broke down. For an instant he softened.
    Gulping back his emotions with a savage imprecation he doggedly
    persevered. At last he paused to consider what should be done
    with the bodies. His first intent was to scoop a large hole in
    the sand with a piece of timber; but when he took into
    consideration the magnitude of the labor involved, requiring
    many hours of hard work and a waste of precious time which
    might be of infinite value to his helpless companion and
    himself, he was forced to abandon the project. It was not only
    impracticable but dangerous.</p>

    <p>Again he had to set his teeth with grim resolution. One by
    one the bodies were shot into the lagoon from the little quay
    of rock. He knew they would not be seen again.</p>

    <p>He was quite unnerved now. He felt as if he had committed a
    colossal crime. In the smooth water of the cove a number of
    black fins were cutting arrow-shaped ripples. The sharks were
    soon busy. He shuddered. God's Providence had ferried him and
    the girl across that very place a few hours ago. How wonderful
    that he and she should be snatched from the sea whilst hundreds
    perished! Why was it? And those others&mdash;why were they
    denied rescue? For an instant he was nearer to prayer than he
    had been for years.</p>

    <p>Some lurking fiend of recollection sprang from out the vista
    of bygone years and choked back the impulse. He arose and shook
    himself like a dog. There was much to be done. He gathered the
    clothes and other articles into a heap and placed portions of
    shattered packing-cases near&mdash;to mislead Iris. Whilst thus
    engaged he kicked up out of the sand a rusty kriss, or Malay
    sword. The presence of this implement startled him. He examined
    it slowly and thrust it out of sight.</p>

    <p>Then he went back to her, after donning his stockings and
    boots, now thoroughly dry.</p>

    <p>"Are you ready now, Miss Deane?" he sang out cheerily.</p>

    <p>"Ready? I have been waiting for you."</p>

    <p>Jenks chuckled quietly. "I must guard my tongue: it betrays
    me," he said to himself.</p>

    <p>Iris joined him. By some mysterious means she had effected
    great improvement in her appearance. Yet there were manifest
    gaps.</p>

    <p>"If only I had a needle and thread&mdash;" she began.</p>

    <p>"If that is all," said the sailor, fumbling in his pockets.
    He produced a shabby little hussif, containing a thimble,
    scissors, needles and some skeins of unbleached thread. Case
    and contents were sodden or rusted with salt water, but the
    girl fastened upon this treasure with a sigh of deep
    content.</p>

    <p>"Now, please," she cried, "I want a telegraph office and a
    ship."</p>

    <p>It was impossible to resist the infection of her high
    spirits. This time he laughed without concealment.</p>

    <p>"We will look for them, Miss Deane. Meanwhile, will you
    oblige me by wearing this? The sun is climbing up rapidly."</p>

    <p>He handed her a sou'wester which he carried. He had secured
    another for himself. The merriment died away from her face. She
    remembered his errand. Being an eminently sensible young woman
    she made no protest, even forcing herself to tie the strings
    beneath her chin.</p>

    <p>When they reached the sands she caught sight of the pile of
    clothes and the broken woodwork, with the small heaps of
    valuables methodically arranged. The harmless subterfuge did
    not deceive her. She darted a quick look of gratitude at her
    companion. How thoughtful he was! After a fearful glance around
    she was reassured, though she wondered what had become
    of&mdash;them.</p>

    <p>"I see you have been busy," she said, nodding towards the
    clothes and boots.</p>

    <p>It was his turn to steal a look of sharp inquiry. 'Twere an
    easier task to read the records of time in the solid rock than
    to glean knowledge from the girl's face.</p>

    <p>"Yes," he replied simply. "Lucky find, wasn't it?"</p>

    <p>"Most fortunate. When they are quite dry I will replenish my
    wardrobe. What is the first thing to be done?"</p>

    <p>"Well, Miss Deane, I think our programme is, in the first
    place, to examine the articles thrown ashore and see if any of
    the cases contain food. Secondly, we should haul high and dry
    everything that may be of use to us, lest the weather should
    break again and the next tide sweep away the spoil. Thirdly, we
    should eat and rest, and finally, we must explore the island
    before the light fails. I am convinced we are alone here. It is
    a small place at the best, and if any Chinamen were ashore they
    would have put in an appearance long since."</p>

    <p>"Do you think, then, that we may remain here long?"</p>

    <p>"It is impossible to form an opinion on that point. Help may
    come in a day. On the other hand&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Yes?"</p>

    <p>"It is a wise thing, Miss Deane, to prepare for other
    contingencies."</p>

    <p>She stood still, and swept the horizon with comprehensive
    eyes. The storm had vanished. Masses of cloud were passing away
    to the west, leaving a glorious expanse of blue sky. Already
    the sea was calming. Huge breakers roared over the reef, but
    beyond it the waves were subsiding into a heavy unbroken
    swell.</p>

    <p>The sailor watched her closely. In the quaint oilskin hat
    and her tattered muslin dress she looked bewitchingly pretty.
    She reminded him of a well-bred and beautiful society lady whom
    he once saw figuring as Grace Darling at a fashionable
    bazaar.</p>

    <p>But Miss Iris's thoughts were serious.</p>

    <p>"Do you mean," she said slowly, without moving her gaze from
    the distant meeting-place of sky and water, "that we may be
    imprisoned here for weeks, perhaps months?"</p>

    <p>"If you cast your mind back a few hours you will perhaps
    admit that we are very fortunate to be here at all."</p>

    <p>She whisked round upon him. "Do not fence with my question,
    Mr. Jenks. Answer me!"</p>

    <p>He bowed. There was a perceptible return of his stubborn
    cynicism when he spoke.</p>

    <p>"The facts are obvious, Miss Deane. The loss of the
    <i>Sirdar</i> will not be definitely known for many days. It
    will be assumed that she has broken down. The agents in
    Singapore will await cabled tidings of her whereabouts. She
    might have drifted anywhere in that typhoon. Ultimately they
    will send out a vessel to search, impelled to that course a
    little earlier by your father's anxiety. Pardon me. I did not
    intend to pain you. I am speaking my mind."</p>

    <p>"Go on," said Iris bravely.</p>

    <p>"The relief ship must search the entire China Sea. The gale
    might have driven a disabled steamer north, south, east or
    west. A typhoon travels in a whirling spiral, you see, and the
    direction of a drifting ship depends wholly upon the locality
    where she sustained damage. The coasts of China, Java, Borneo,
    and the Philippines are not equipped with lighthouses on every
    headland and cordoned with telegraph wires. There are river
    pirates and savage races to be reckoned with. Casting aside all
    other possibilities, and assuming that a prompt search is made
    to the south of our course, this part of the ocean is full of
    reefs and small islands, some inhabited permanently, others
    visited occasionally by fishermen." He was about to add
    something, but checked himself.</p>

    <p>"To sum up," he continued hurriedly, "we may have to remain
    here for many days, even months. There is always a chance of
    speedy help. We must act, however, on the basis of detention
    for an indefinite period. I am discussing appearances as they
    are. A survey of the island may change all these views."</p>

    <p>"In what way?"</p>

    <p>He turned and pointed to the summit of the tree-covered hill
    behind them.</p>

    <p>"From that point," he said, "we may see other and larger
    islands. If so, they will certainly be inhabited. I am
    surprised this one is not."</p>

    <p>He ended abruptly. They were losing time. Before Iris could
    join him he was already hauling a large undamaged case out of
    the water.</p>

    <p>He laughed unmirthfully. "Champagne!" he said, "A good
    brand, too!"</p>

    <p>This man was certainly an enigma. Iris wrinkled her pretty
    forehead in the effort to place him in a fitting category. His
    words and accent were those of an educated gentleman, yet his
    actions and manners were studiously uncouth when he thought she
    was observing him. The veneer of roughness puzzled her. That he
    was naturally of refined temperament she knew quite well, not
    alone by perception but by the plain evidence of his earlier
    dealings with her. Then why this affectation of coarseness,
    this borrowed aroma of the steward's mess and the
    forecastle?</p>

    <p>To the best of her ability she silently helped in the work
    of salvage. They made a queer collection. A case of champagne,
    and another of brandy. A box of books. A pair of night glasses.
    A compass. Several boxes of ship's biscuits, coated with salt,
    but saved by their hardness, having been immersed but a few
    seconds. Two large cases of hams in equally good condition.
    Some huge dish-covers. A bit of twisted ironwork, and a great
    quantity of cordage and timber.</p>

    <p>There was one very heavy package which their united strength
    could not lift. The sailor searched round until he found an
    iron bar that could be wrenched from its socket. With this he
    pried open the strong outer cover and revealed the
    contents&mdash;regulation boxes of Lee-Metford ammunition, each
    containing 500 rounds.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" he cried, "now we want some rifles."</p>

    <p>"What good would they be?" inquired Iris.</p>

    <p>He softly denounced himself as a fool, but he answered at
    once: "To shoot birds, of course, Miss Deane. There are plenty
    here, and many of them are edible."</p>

    <p>"You have two revolvers and some cartridges."</p>

    <p>"Yes. They are useful in a way, but not for pot
    hunting."</p>

    <p>"How stupid of me! What you really need is a shot-gun."</p>

    <p>He smiled grimly. At times his sense of humor forced a way
    through the outward shield of reserve, of defiance it might
    be.</p>

    <p>"The only persons I ever heard of," he said, "who landed
    under compulsion on a desert island with a ship-load of
    requisites, were the Swiss Family Robinson."</p>

    <p>"Good gracious!" cried Iris irrelevantly; "I had not even
    thought of Robinson Crusoe until this moment. Isn't it odd?
    I&mdash;we&mdash;"</p>

    <p>She pulled herself up short, firmly resolved not to blush.
    Without flinching she challenged him to complete her sentence.
    He dared not do it. He could not be mean enough to take
    advantage of her slip.</p>

    <p>Instantly he helped her embarrassment. "I hope the parallel
    will not hold good," he said. "In any event, you, Miss Deane,
    fill a part less familiar in fiction."</p>

    <p>The phrase was neat. It meant much or little, as fancy
    dictated. Iris at first felt profoundly grateful for his tact.
    Thinking the words over at leisure she became hot and very
    angry.</p>

    <p>They worked in silence for another hour. The sun was nearing
    the zenith. They were distressed with the increasing heat of
    the day. Jenks secured a ham and some biscuits, some pieces of
    driftwood and the binoculars, and invited Miss Deane to
    accompany him to the grove. She obeyed without a word, though
    she wondered how he proposed to light a fire. To contribute
    something towards the expected feast she picked up a dish-cover
    and a bottle of champagne.</p>

    <p>The sailor eyed the concluding item with disfavor. "Not
    whilst the sun is up." he said. "In the evening, yes."</p>

    <p>"It was for you," explained Iris, coldly. "I do not drink
    wine."</p>

    <p>"You must break the pledge whilst you are here, Miss Deane.
    It is often very cold at night in this latitude. A chill would
    mean fever and perhaps death."</p>

    <p>"What a strange man!" murmured the girl.</p>

    <p>She covertly watched his preparations. He tore a dry leaf
    from a notebook and broke the bullet out of a cartridge,
    damping the powder with water from a pitcher-plant. Smearing
    the composition on the paper, he placed it in the sun, where it
    dried at once. He gathered a small bundle of withered spines
    from the palms, and arranged the driftwood on top, choosing a
    place for his bonfire just within the shade. Then, inserting
    the touch-paper among the spines, he unscrewed one of the
    lenses of the binoculars, converted it into a burning-glass,
    and had a fine blaze roaring merrily in a few minutes. With the
    aid of pointed sticks he grilled some slices of ham, cut with
    his clasp-knife, which he first carefully cleaned in the earth.
    The biscuits were of the variety that become soft when toasted,
    and so he balanced a few by stones near the fire.</p>

    <p>Iris forgot her annoyance in her interest. A most appetizing
    smell filled the air. They were having a picnic amidst
    delightful surroundings. Yesterday at this time&mdash;she
    almost yielded to a rush of sentiment, but forced it back with
    instant determination. Tears were a poor resource, unmindful of
    God's goodness to herself and her companion. Without the sailor
    what would have become of her, even were she thrown ashore
    while still living? She knew none of the expedients which
    seemed to be at his command. It was a most ungrateful
    proceeding to be vexed with him for her own thoughtless
    suggestion that she occupied a new r&ocirc;le as Mrs.
    Crusoe.</p>

    <p>"Can I do nothing to help?" she exclaimed. So contrite was
    her tone that Jenks was astonished.</p>

    <p>"Yes," he said, pointing to the dish-cover. "If you polish
    the top of that with your sleeve it will serve as a plate.
    Luncheon is ready."</p>

    <p>He neatly dished up two slices of ham on a couple of
    biscuits and handed them to her, with the clasp-knife.</p>

    <p>"I can depend on my fingers," he explained. "It will not be
    the first time."</p>

    <p>"Have you led an adventurous life?" she asked, by way of
    polite conversation.</p>

    <p>"No," he growled.</p>

    <p>"I only thought so because you appear to know all sorts of
    dodges for prolonging existence&mdash;things I never heard
    of."</p>

    <p>"Broiled ham&mdash;and biscuits&mdash;for instance?"</p>

    <p>At another time Iris would have snapped at him for the
    retort. Still humbly regretful for her previous attitude she
    answered meekly&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Yes, in this manner of cooking them, I mean. But there are
    other items&mdash;methods of lighting fires, finding water,
    knowing what fruits and other articles may be found on a desert
    island, such as plantains and cocoanuts, certain sorts of
    birds&mdash;and <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>."</p>

    <p>For the life of her she could not tell why she tacked on
    that weird item to her list.</p>

    <p>The sailor inquired, more civilly&mdash;"Then you are
    acquainted with trepang?"</p>

    <p>"Who?"</p>

    <p>"Trepang&mdash;<i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>, you know."</p>

    <p>Iris made a desperate guess. "Yes," she said, demurely. "It
    makes beautiful backs for hair brushes. And it looks so nice as
    a frame for platinotype photographs. I have&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Jenks swallowed a large piece of ham and became very red. At
    last he managed to say&mdash;"I beg your pardon. You are
    thinking of tortoise-shell. <i>B&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> is a sort
    of marine slug."</p>

    <p>"How odd!" said Iris.</p>

    <p>She had discovered at an early age the tactical value of
    this remark, and the experience of maturer years confirmed the
    success of juvenile efforts to upset the equanimity of
    governesses. Even the sailor was silenced.</p>

    <p>Talk ceased until the meal was ended. Jenks sprang lightly
    to his feet. Rest and food had restored his faculties. The girl
    thought dreamily, as he stood there in his rough attire, that
    she had never seen a finer man. He was tall, sinewy, and well
    formed. In repose his face was pleasant, if masterful. Its
    somewhat sullen, self-contained expression was occasional and
    acquired. She wondered how he could be so energetic. Personally
    she was consumed with sleepiness.</p>

    <p>He produced a revolver.</p>

    <p>"Do you mind if I fire a shot to test these cartridges?" he
    inquired. "The powder is all right, but the fulminate in the
    caps may be damaged."</p>

    <p>She agreed promptly. He pointed the weapon at a cluster of
    cocoanuts, and there was a loud report. Two nuts fell to the
    ground, and the air was filled with shrill screams and the
    flapping of innumerable wings. Iris was momentarily dismayed,
    but her senses confirmed the sailor's
    explanation&mdash;"Sea-birds."</p>

    <p>He reloaded the empty chamber, and was about to say
    something, when a queer sound, exactly resembling the gurgling
    of water poured from a large bottle, fell upon their ears. It
    came from the interior of the grove, and the two exchanged a
    quick look of amazed questioning. Jenks took a hasty step in
    the direction of the noise, but he stopped and laughed at his
    own expense. Iris liked the sound of his mirth. It was genuine,
    not forced.</p>

    <p>"I remember now," he explained. "The wou-wou monkey cries in
    that peculiar warble. The presence of the animal here shows
    that the island has been inhabited at some time."</p>

    <p>"You remember?" repeated the girl. "Then you have been in
    this part of the world before?"</p>

    <p>"No. I mean I have read about it."</p>

    <p>Twice in half an hour had he curtly declined to indulge in
    personal reminiscences.</p>

    <p>"Can you use a revolver?" he went on.</p>

    <p>"My father taught me. He thinks every woman should know how
    to defend herself if need be."</p>

    <p>"Excellent. Well, Miss Deane, you must try to sleep for a
    couple of hours. I purpose examining the coast for some
    distance on each side. Should you want me, a shot will be the
    best sort of signal."</p>

    <p>"I am very tired," she admitted. "But you?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, I am all right. I feel restless; that is, I mean I will
    not be able to sleep until night comes, and before we climb the
    hill to survey our domain I want to find better quarters than
    we now possess."</p>

    <p>Perhaps, were she less fatigued, she would have caught the
    vague anxiety, the note of distrust, in his voice. But the
    carpet of sand and leaves on which she lay was very seductive.
    Her eyes closed. She nestled into a comfortable position, and
    slept.</p>

    <p>The man looked at her steadily for a little while. Then he
    moved the revolver out of harm's way to a spot where she must
    see it instantly, pulled his sou'wester well over his eyes and
    walked off quietly.</p>

    <p>They were flung ashore on the north-west side of the island.
    Except for the cove formed by the coral reef, with its
    mysterious palm-tree growing apparently in the midst of the
    waves, the shape of the coast was roughly that of the concave
    side of a bow, the two visible extremities being about
    three-quarters of a mile apart.</p>

    <p>He guessed, by the way in which the sea raced past these
    points, that the land did not extend beyond them. Behind him,
    it rose steeply to a considerable height, 150 or 200 feet. In
    the center was the tallest hill, which seemed to end abruptly
    towards the south-west. On the north-east side it was connected
    with a rocky promontory by a ridge of easy grade. The sailor
    turned to the south-west, as offering the most likely direction
    for rapid survey.</p>

    <p>He followed the line of vegetation; there the ground was
    firm and level. There was no suggestion of the mariner's roll
    in his steady gait. Alter his clothing, change the heavy boots
    into spurred Wellingtons, and he would be the <i>beau
    id&eacute;al</i> of a cavalry soldier, the order of Melchisedec
    in the profession of arms.</p>

    <p>He was not surprised to find that the hill terminated in a
    sheer wall of rock, which stood out, ominous and massive, from
    the wealth of verdure clothing the remainder of the ridge.
    Facing the precipice, and separated from it by a strip of
    ground not twenty feet above the sea-level in the highest part,
    was another rock-built eminence, quite bare of trees, blackened
    by the weather and scarred in a manner that attested the
    attacks of lightning.</p>

    <p>He whistled softly. "By Jove!" he said. "Volcanic, and
    highly mineralized."</p>

    <p>The intervening belt was sparsely dotted with trees,
    casuarinas, poon, and other woods he did not know, resembling
    ebony and cedar. A number of stumps showed that the axe had
    been at work, but not recently. He passed into the cleft and
    climbed a tree that offered easy access. As he expected, after
    rising a few feet from the ground, his eyes encountered the
    solemn blue line of the sea, not half a mile distant.</p>

    <p>He descended and commenced a systematic search. Men had been
    here. Was there a house? Would he suddenly encounter some
    hermit Malay or Chinaman?</p>

    <p>At the foot of the main cliff was a cluster of fruit-bearing
    trees, plantains, areca-nuts, and cocoa-palms. A couple of
    cinchonas caught his eye. In one spot the undergrowth was rank
    and vividly green. The cassava, or tapioca plant, reared its
    high, passion-flower leaves above the grass, and some
    sago-palms thrust aloft their thick-stemmed trunks.</p>

    <p>"Here is a change of menu, at any rate," he communed.</p>

    <p>Breaking a thick branch off a poon tree he whittled away the
    minor stems. A strong stick was needful to explore that leafy
    fastness thoroughly.</p>

    <p>A few cautious strides and vigorous whacks with the stick
    laid bare the cause of such prodigality in a soil covered with
    drifted sand and lumps of black and white speckled coral. The
    trees and bushes enclosed a well&mdash;safe-guarded it, in
    fact, from being choked with sand during the first gale that
    blew.</p>

    <p>Delighted with this discovery, more precious than diamonds
    at the moment, for he doubted the advisability of existing on
    the water supply of the pitcher-plant, he knelt to peer into
    the excavation. The well had been properly made. Ten feet down
    he could see the reflection of his face. Expert hands had
    tapped the secret reservoir of the island. By stretching to the
    full extent of his arm, he managed to plunge the stick into the
    water. Tasting the drops, he found that they were quite sweet.
    The sand and porous rock provided the best of filter-beds.</p>

    <p>He rose, wall pleased, and noted that on the opposite side
    the appearance of the shrubs and tufts of long grass indicated
    the existence of a grown-over path towards the cliff. He
    followed it, walking carelessly, with eyes seeking the prospect
    beyond, when something rattled and cracked beneath his feet.
    Looking down, he was horrified to find he was trampling on a
    skeleton.</p>

    <p>Had a venomous snake coiled its glistening folds around his
    leg he would not have been more startled. But this man of iron
    nerve soon recovered. He frowned deeply after the first
    involuntary heart-throb.</p>

    <p>With the stick he cleared away the undergrowth, and revealed
    the skeleton of a man. The bones were big and strong, but
    oxidized by the action of the air. Jenks had injured the left
    tibia by his tread, but three fractured ribs and a smashed
    shoulder-blade told some terrible unwritten story.</p>

    <p>Beneath the mournful relics were fragments of decayed cloth.
    It was blue serge. Lying about were a few blackened
    objects&mdash;brass buttons marked with an anchor. The dead
    man's boots were in the best state of preservation, but the
    leather had shrunk and the nails protruded like fangs.</p>

    <p>A rusted pocket-knife lay there, and on the left breast of
    the skeleton rested a round piece of tin, the top of a
    canister, which might have reposed in a coat pocket. Jenks
    picked it up. Some curious marks and figures were punched into
    its surface. After a hasty glance he put it aside for more
    leisurely examination.</p>

    <p>No weapon was visible. He could form no estimate as to the
    cause of the death of this poor unknown, nor the time since the
    tragedy had occurred.</p>

    <p>Jenks must have stood many minutes before he perceived that
    the skeleton was headless. At first he imagined that in
    rummaging about with the stick he had disturbed the skull. But
    the most minute search demonstrated that it had gone, had been
    taken away, in fact, for the plants which so effectually
    screened the lighter bones would not permit the skull to
    vanish.</p>

    <p>Then the frown on the sailor's face became threatening,
    thunderous. He recollected the rusty kriss. Indistinct memories
    of strange tales of the China Sea crowded unbidden to his
    brain.</p>

    <p>"Dyaks!" he growled fiercely. "A ship's officer, an
    Englishman probably, murdered by head-hunting Dyak
    pirates!"</p>

    <p>If they came once they would come again.</p>

    <p>Five hundred yards away Iris Deane was sleeping. He ought
    not to have left her alone. And then, with the devilish
    ingenuity of coincidence, a revolver shot awoke the echoes, and
    sent all manner of wildfowl hurtling through the trees with
    clamorous outcry.</p>

    <p>Panting and wild-eyed, Jenks was at the girl's side in an
    inconceivably short space of time. She was not beneath the
    shelter of the grove, but on the sands, gazing, pallid in cheek
    and lip, at the group of rocks on the edge of the lagoon.</p>

    <p>"What is the matter?" he gasped.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I don't know," she wailed brokenly. "I had a dream,
    such a horrible dream. You were struggling with some awful
    thing down there." She pointed to the rocks.</p>

    <p>"I was not near the place," he said laboriously. It cost him
    an effort to breathe. His broad chest expanded inches with each
    respiration.</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes, I understand. But I awoke and ran to save you.
    When I got here I saw something, a thing with waving arms, and
    fired. It vanished, and then you came."</p>

    <p>The sailor walked slowly to the rocks. A fresh chip out of
    the stone showed where the bullet struck. One huge boulder was
    wet, as if water had been splashed over it. He halted and
    looked intently into the water. Not a fish was to be seen, but
    small spirals of sand were eddying up from the bottom, where it
    shelved steeply from the shore.</p>

    <p>Iris followed him. "See," she cried excitedly. "I was not
    mistaken. There <i>was</i> something here."</p>

    <p>A creepy sensation ran up the man's spine and passed behind
    his ears. At this spot the drowned Lascars were lying. Like an
    inspiration came the knowledge that the cuttlefish, the dreaded
    octopus, abounds in the China Sea.</p>

    <p>His face was livid when he turned to Iris. "You are
    over-wrought by fatigue, Miss Deane," he said. "What you saw
    was probably a seal;" he knew the ludicrous substitution would
    not be questioned. "Please go and lie down again."</p>

    <p>"I cannot," she protested. "I am too frightened."</p>

    <p>"Frightened! By a dream! In broad daylight!"</p>

    <p>"But why are <i>you</i> so pale? What has alarmed you?"</p>

    <p>"Can you ask? Did you not give the agreed signal?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Her inquiring glance fell. He was breathless from agitation
    rather than running. He was perturbed on her account. For an
    instant she had looked into his soul.</p>

    <p>"I will go back," she said quietly, "though I would rather
    accompany you. What are you doing?"</p>

    <p>"Seeking a place to lay our heads," he answered, with gruff
    carelessness. "You really must rest, Miss Deane. Otherwise you
    will be broken up by fatigue and become ill."</p>

    <p>So Iris again sought her couch of sand, and the sailor
    returned to the skeleton. They separated unwillingly, each
    thinking only of the other's safety and comfort. The girl knew
    she was not wanted because the man wished to spare her some
    unpleasant experience. She obeyed him with a sigh, and sat
    down, not to sleep, but to muse, as girls will, round-eyed,
    wistful, with the angelic fantasy of youth and innocence.</p>
    <hr>
    <a name="CHAPTER_IV"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

    <h2>RAINBOW ISLAND</h2>

    <p>Across the parched bones lay the stick discarded by Jenks in
    his alarm. He picked it up and resumed his progress along the
    pathway. So closely did he now examine the ground that he
    hardly noted his direction. The track led straight towards the
    wall of rock. The distance was not great&mdash;about forty
    yards. At first the brushwood impeded him, but soon even this
    hindrance disappeared, and a well-defined passage meandered
    through a belt of trees, some strong and lofty, others quite
    immature.</p>

    <p>More bushes gathered at the foot of the cliff. Behind them
    he could see the mouth of a cave; the six months' old growth of
    vegetation about the entrance gave clear indication as to the
    time which had elapsed since a human foot last disturbed the
    solitude.</p>

    <p>A few vigorous blows with the stick cleared away obstructing
    plants and leafy branches. The sailor stooped and looked into
    the cavern, for the opening was barely five feet high. He
    perceived instantly that the excavation was man's handiwork,
    applied to a fault in the hard rock. A sort of natural shaft
    existed, and this had been extended by manual labor. Beyond the
    entrance the cave became more lofty. Owing to its position with
    reference to the sun at that hour Jenks imagined that
    sufficient light would be obtainable when the tropical
    luxuriance of foliage outside was dispensed with.</p>

    <p>At present the interior was dark. With the stick he tapped
    the walls and roof. A startled cluck and the rush of wings
    heralded the flight of two birds, alarmed by the noise. Soon
    his eyes, more accustomed to the gloom, made out that the place
    was about thirty feet deep, ten feet wide in the center, and
    seven or eight feet high.</p>

    <p>At the further end was a collection of objects inviting
    prompt attention. Each moment he could see with greater
    distinctness. Kneeling on one side of the little pile he
    discerned that on a large stone, serving as a rude bench, were
    some tin utensils, some knives, a sextant, and a quantity of
    empty cartridge cases. Between the stone and what a miner terms
    the "face" of the rock was a four-foot space. Here, half
    imbedded in the sand which covered the floor, were two
    pickaxes, a shovel, a sledge-hammer, a fine timber-felling axe,
    and three crowbars.</p>

    <p>In the darkest corner of the cave's extremity the "wall"
    appeared to be very smooth. He prodded with the stick, and
    there was a sharp clang of tin. He discovered six square
    kerosene-oil cases carefully stacked up. Three were empty, one
    seemed to be half full, and the contents of two were untouched.
    With almost feverish haste he ascertained that the half-filled
    tin did really contain oil.</p>

    <p>"What a find!" he ejaculated aloud. Another pair of birds
    dashed from a ledge near the roof.</p>

    <p>"Confound you!" shouted the sailor. He sprang back and
    whacked the walls viciously, but all the feathered intruders
    had gone.</p>

    <p>So far as he could judge the cave harbored no further
    surprises. Returning towards the exit his boots dislodged more
    empty cartridges from the sand. They were shells adapted to a
    revolver of heavy caliber. At a short distance from the doorway
    they were present in dozens.</p>

    <p>"The remnants of a fight," he thought. "The man was
    attacked, and defended himself here. Not expecting the arrival
    of enemies he provided no store of food or water. He was killed
    whilst trying to reach the well, probably at night."</p>

    <p>He vividly pictured the scene&mdash;a brave, hardy European
    keeping at bay a boatload of Dyak savages, enduring manfully
    the agonies of hunger, thirst, perhaps wounds. Then the siege,
    followed by a wild effort to gain the life-giving well, the
    hiss of a Malay parang wielded by a lurking foe, and the last
    despairing struggle before death came.</p>

    <p>He might be mistaken. Perchance there was a less dramatic
    explanation. But he could not shake off his, first impressions.
    They were garnered from dumb evidence and developed by some
    occult but overwhelming sense of certainty.</p>

    <p>"What was the poor devil doing here?" he asked. "Why did he
    bury himself in this rock, with mining utensils and a few rough
    stores? He could not be a castaway. There is the indication of
    purpose, of preparation, of method combined with ignorance, for
    none who knew the ways of Dyaks and Chinese pirates would
    venture to live here alone, if he could help it, and if he
    really were alone." The thing was a mystery, would probably
    remain a mystery for ever.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Be it steel or be it lead,</p>

            <p>Anyhow the man is dead."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>There was relief in hearing his own voice. He could hum, and
    think, and act. Arming himself with the axe he attacked the
    bushes and branches of trees in front of the cave. He cut a
    fresh approach to the well, and threw the litter over the
    skeleton. At first he was inclined to bury it where it lay, but
    he disliked the idea of Iris walking unconsciously over the
    place. No time could be wasted that day. He would seize an
    early opportunity to act as grave-digger.</p>

    <p>After an absence of little more than an hour he rejoined the
    girl. She saw him from afar, and wondered whence he obtained
    the axe he shouldered.</p>

    <p>"You are a successful explorer," she cried when he drew
    near.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Miss Deane. I have found water, implements, a shelter,
    even light."</p>

    <p>"What sort of light&mdash;spiritual, or material?"</p>

    <p>"Oil."</p>

    <p>"Oh!"</p>

    <p>Iris could not remain serious for many consecutive minutes,
    but she gathered that he was in no mood for frivolity.</p>

    <p>"And the shelter&mdash;is it a house?" she continued.</p>

    <p>"No, a cave. If you are sufficiently rested you might come
    and take possession."</p>

    <p>Her eyes danced with excitement. He told her what he had
    seen, with reservations, and she ran on before him to witness
    these marvels.</p>

    <p>"Why did you make a new path to the well?" she inquired
    after a rapid survey.</p>

    <p>"A new path!" The pertinent question staggered him.</p>

    <p>"Yes, the people who lived here must have had some sort of
    free passage."</p>

    <p>He lied easily. "I have only cleared away recent growth," he
    said.</p>

    <p>"And why did they dig a cave? It surely would be much more
    simple to build a house from all these trees."</p>

    <p>"There you puzzle me," he said frankly.</p>

    <p>They had entered the cavern but a little way and now came
    out.</p>

    <p>"These empty cartridges are funny. They suggest a fort, a
    battle." Woman-like, her words were carelessly chosen, but they
    were crammed with inductive force.</p>

    <p>Embarked on the toboggan slope of untruth the sailor slid
    smoothly downwards.</p>

    <p>"Events have colored your imagination, Miss Deane. Even in
    England men often preserve such things for future use. They can
    be reloaded."</p>

    <p>"Yes, I have seen keepers do that. This is different. There
    is an air of&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"There is a lot to be done," broke in Jenks emphatically.
    "We must climb the hill and get back here in time to light
    another fire before the sun goes down. I want to prop a canvas
    sheet in front of the cave, and try to devise a lamp."</p>

    <p>"Must I sleep inside?" demanded Iris.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Where else?"</p>

    <p>There was a pause, a mere whiff of awkwardness.</p>

    <p>"I will mount guard outside," went on Jenks. He was trying
    to improve the edge of the axe by grinding it on a soft
    stone.</p>

    <p>The girl went into the cave again. She was inquisitive,
    uneasy.</p>

    <p>"That arrangement&mdash;" she began, but ended in a sharp
    cry of terror. The dispossessed birds had returned during the
    sailor's absence.</p>

    <p>"I will kill them," he shouted in anger.</p>

    <p>"Please don't. There has been enough of death in this place
    already."</p>

    <p>The words jarred on his ears. Then he felt that she could
    only allude to the victims of the wreck.</p>

    <p>"I was going to say," she explained, "that we must devise a
    partition. There is no help for it until you construct a sort
    of house. Candidly, I do not like this hole in the rock. It is
    a vault, a tomb."</p>

    <p>"You told me that I was in command, yet you dispute my
    orders." He strove hard to appear brusquely good-humored,
    indifferent, though for one of his mould he was absurdly
    irritable. The cause was over-strain, but that explanation
    escaped him.</p>

    <p>"Quite true. But if sleeping in the cold, in dew or rain, is
    bad for me, it must be equally bad for you. And without you I
    am helpless, you know."</p>

    <p>His arms twitched to give her a reassuring hug. In some
    respects she was so childlike; her big blue eyes were so
    ingenuous. He laughed sardonically, and the harsh note clashed
    with her frank candor. Here, at least, she was utterly
    deceived. His changeful moods were incomprehensible.</p>

    <p>"I will serve you to the best of my ability, Miss Deane," he
    exclaimed. "We must hope for a speedy rescue, and I am inured
    to exposure. It is otherwise with you. Are you ready for the
    climb?"</p>

    <p>Mechanically she picked up a stick at her feet. It was the
    sailor's wand of investigation. He snatched it from her hands
    and threw it away among the trees.</p>

    <p>"That is a dangerous alpenstock," he said. "The wood is
    unreliable. It might break. I will cut you a better one," and
    he swung the axe against a tall sapling.</p>

    <p>Iris mentally described him as "funny." She followed him in
    the upward curve of the ascent, for the grade was not difficult
    and the ground smooth enough, the storms of years having
    pulverized the rock and driven sand into its clefts. The
    persistent inroads of the trees had done the rest. Beyond the
    flight of birds and the scampering of some tiny monkeys
    overhead, they did not disturb a living creature.</p>

    <p>The crest of the hill was tree-covered, and they could see
    nothing beyond their immediate locality until the sailor found
    a point higher than the rest, where a rugged collection of hard
    basalt and the uprooting of some poon trees provided an open
    space elevated above the ridge.</p>

    <p>For a short distance the foothold was precarious. Jenks
    helped the girl in this part of the climb. His strong, gentle
    grasp gave her confidence. She was flushed with exertion when
    they stood together on the summit of this elevated perch. They
    could look to every point of the compass except a small section
    on the south-west. Here the trees rose behind them until the
    brow of the precipice was reached.</p>

    <p>The emergence into a sunlit panorama of land and sea, though
    expected, was profoundly enthralling. They appeared to stand
    almost exactly in the center of the island, which was
    crescent-shaped. It was no larger than the sailor had
    estimated. The new slopes now revealed were covered with
    verdure down to the very edge of the water, which, for nearly a
    mile seawards, broke over jagged reefs. The sea looked
    strangely calm from this height. Irregular blue patches on the
    horizon to south and east caught the man's first glance. He
    unslung the binoculars he still carried and focused them
    eagerly.</p>

    <p>"Islands!" he cried, "and big ones, too!"</p>

    <p>"How odd!" whispered Iris, more concerned in the scrutiny of
    her immediate surroundings. Jenks glanced at her sharply. She
    was not looking at the islands, but at a curious hollow, a
    quarry-like depression beneath them to the right, distant about
    three hundred yards and not far removed from the small plateau
    containing the well, though isolated from it by the south angle
    of the main cliff.</p>

    <p>Here, in a great circle, there was not a vestige of grass,
    shrub, or tree, nothing save brown rock and sand. At first the
    sailor deemed it to be the dried-up bed of a small lake. This
    hypothesis would not serve, else it would be choked with
    verdure. The pit stared up at them like an ominous eye, though
    neither paid further attention to it, for the glorious prospect
    mapped at their feet momentarily swept aside all other
    considerations.</p>

    <p>"What a beautiful place!" murmured Iris. "I wonder what it
    is called."</p>

    <p>"Limbo."</p>

    <p>The word came instantly. The sailor's gaze was again fixed
    on those distant blue outlines. Miss Deane was
    dissatisfied.</p>

    <p>"Nonsense!" she exclaimed. "We are not dead yet. You must
    find a better name than that."</p>

    <p>"Well, suppose we christen it Rainbow Island?"</p>

    <p>"Why 'Rainbow'?"</p>

    <p>"That is the English meaning of 'Iris,' in Latin, you
    know."</p>

    <p>"So it is. How clever of you to think of it! Tell me, what
    is the meaning of 'Robert,' in Greek?"</p>

    <p>He turned to survey the north-west side of the island. "I do
    not know," he answered. "It might not be far-fetched to
    translate it as 'a ship's steward: a menial.'"</p>

    <p>Miss Iris had meant her playful retort as a mere
    light-hearted quibble. It annoyed her, a young person of much
    consequence, to have her kindly condescension repelled.</p>

    <p>"I suppose so," she agreed; "but I have gone through so much
    in a few hours that I am bewildered, apt to forget these nice
    distinctions."</p>

    <p>Where these two quareling, or flirting? Who can tell?</p>

    <p>Jenks was closely examining the reef on which the
    <i>Sirdar</i> struck. Some square objects were visible near the
    palm tree. The sun, glinting on the waves, rendered it
    difficult to discern their significance.</p>

    <p>"What do you make of those?" he inquired, handing the
    glasses, and blandly ignoring Miss Deane's petulance. Her brain
    was busy with other things while she twisted the binoculars to
    suit her vision. Rainbow Island&mdash;Iris&mdash;it was a nice
    conceit. But "menial" struck a discordant note. This man was no
    menial in appearance or speech. Why was he so deliberately
    rude?</p>

    <p>"I think they are boxes or packing-cases," she
    announced.</p>

    <p>"Ah, that was my own idea. I must visit that locality."</p>

    <p>"How? Will you swim?"</p>

    <p>"No," he said, his stern lips relaxing in a smile, "I will
    not swim; and by the way, Miss Deane, be careful when you are
    near the water. The lagoon is swarming with sharks at present.
    I feel tolerably assured that at low tide, when the remnants of
    the gale have vanished, I will be able to walk there along the
    reef."</p>

    <p>"Sharks!" she cried. "In there! What horrible surprises this
    speck of land contains! I should not have imagined that sharks
    and seals could live together."</p>

    <p>"You are quite right," he explained, with becoming gravity.
    "As a rule sharks infest only the leeward side of these
    islands. Just now they are attracted in shoals by the
    wreck."</p>

    <p>"Oh." Iris shivered slightly.</p>

    <p>"We had better go back now. The wind is keen here, Miss
    Deane."</p>

    <p class="figcenter"><a href="images/wm_4_1.png"><img alt=

    <p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">He was so busy that he
    paid little heed to iris, but the odor of fried ham was wafted
    to him.</span></p>

    <p>She knew that he purposely misunderstood her gesture. His
    attitude conveyed a rebuke. There was no further room for
    sentiment in their present existence; they had to deal with
    chill necessities. As for the sailor, he was glad that the
    chance turn of their conversation enabled him to warn her
    against the lurking dangers of the lagoon. There was no need to
    mention the devil-fish now; he must spare her all avoidable
    thrills.</p>

    <p>They gathered the stores from the first <i>al fresco</i>
    dining-room and reached the cave without incident. Another fire
    was lighted, and whilst Iris attended to the kitchen the sailor
    felled several young trees. He wanted poles, and these were the
    right size and shape. He soon cleared a considerable space. The
    timber was soft and so small in girth that three cuts with the
    axe usually sufficed. He dragged from the beach the smallest
    tarpaulin he could find, and propped it against the rock in
    such manner that it effectually screened the mouth of the cave,
    though admitting light and air.</p>

    <p>He was so busy that he paid little heed to Iris. But the
    odor of fried ham was wafted to him. He was lifting a couple of
    heavy stones to stay the canvas and keep it from flapping in
    the wind, when the girl called out&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Wouldn't you like to have a wash before dinner?"</p>

    <p>He straightened himself and looked at her. Her face and
    hands were shining, spotless. The change was so great that his
    brow wrinkled with perplexity.</p>

    <p>"I am a good pupil," she cried. "You see I am already
    learning to help myself. I made a bucket out of one of the
    dish-covers by slinging it in two ropes. Another dish-cover,
    some sand and leaves supplied basin, soap, and towel. I have
    cleaned the tin cups and the knives, and see, here is my
    greatest treasure."</p>

    <p>She held up a small metal lamp.</p>

    <p>"Where in the world did you find that?" he exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"Buried in the sand inside the cave."</p>

    <p>"Anything else?"</p>

    <p>His tone was abrupt She was so disappointed by the seeming
    want of appreciation of her industry that a gleam of amusement
    died from her eyes and she shook her head, stooping at once to
    attend to the toasting of some biscuits.</p>

    <p>This time he was genuinely sorry.</p>

    <p>"Forgive me, Miss Deane," he said penitently. "My words are
    dictated by anxiety. I do not wish you to make discoveries on
    your own account. This is a strange place, you know&mdash;an
    unpleasant one in some respects."</p>

    <p>"Surely I can rummage about my own cave?"</p>

    <p>"Most certainly. It was careless of me not to have examined
    its interior more thoroughly."</p>

    <p>"Then why do you grumble because I found the lamp?"</p>

    <p>"I did not mean any such thing. I am sorry."</p>

    <p>"I think you are horrid. If you want to wash you will find
    the water over there. Don't wait. The ham will be frizzled to a
    cinder."</p>

    <p>Unlucky Jenks! Was ever man fated to incur such unmerited
    odium? He savagely laved his face and neck. The fresh cool
    water was delightful at first, but it caused his injured nail
    to throb dreadfully. When he drew near to the fire he
    experienced an unaccountable sensation of weakness. Could it be
    possible that he was going to faint? It was too absurd. He sank
    to the ground. Trees, rocks, and sand-strewn earth indulged in
    a mad dance. Iris's voice sounded weak and indistinct. It
    seemed to travel in waves from a great distance. He tried to
    brush away from his brain these dim fancies, but his iron will
    for once failed, and he pitched headlong downwards into
    darkness.</p>

    <p>When he recovered the girl's left arm was round his neck.
    For one blissful instant he nestled there contentedly. He
    looked into her eyes and saw that she was crying. A gust of
    anger rose within him that he should be the cause of those
    tears.</p>

    <p>"Damn!" he said, and tried to rise.</p>

    <p>"Oh! are you better?" Her lips quivered pitifully.</p>

    <p>"Yes. What happened? Did I faint?"</p>

    <p>"Drink this."</p>

    <p>She held a cup to his mouth and he obediently strove to
    swallow the contents. It was champagne. After the first spasm
    of terror, and when the application of water to his face failed
    to restore consciousness, Iris had knocked the head off the
    bottle of champagne.</p>

    <p>He quickly revived. Nature had only given him a warning that
    he was overdrawing his resources. He was deeply humiliated. He
    did not conceive the truth, that only a strong man could do all
    that he had done and live. For thirty-six hours he had not
    slept. During part of the time he fought with wilder beasts
    than they knew at Ephesus. The long exposure to the sun, the
    mental strain of his foreboding that the charming girl whose
    life depended upon him might be exposed to even worse dangers
    than any yet encountered, the physical labor he had undergone,
    the irksome restraint he strove to place upon his conduct and
    utterances&mdash;all these things culminated in utter
    relaxation when the water touched his heated skin.</p>

    <p>But he was really very much annoyed. A powerful man always
    is annoyed when forced to yield. The revelation of a limit to
    human endurance infuriates him. A woman invariably thinks that
    the man should be scolded, by way of tonic.</p>

    <p>"How <i>could</i> you frighten me so?" demanded Iris,
    hysterically. "You must have felt that you were working too
    hard. You made me rest. Why didn't you rest yourself?"</p>

    <p>He looked at her wistfully. This collapse must not happen
    again, for her sake. These two said more with eyes than lips.
    She withdrew her arm; her face and neck crimsoned.</p>

    <p>"There," she said with compelled cheerfulness. "You are all
    right now. Finish the wine."</p>

    <p>He emptied the tin. It gave him new life. "I always
    thought," he answered gravely, "that champagne was worth its
    weight in gold under certain conditions. These are the
    conditions."</p>

    <p>Iris reflected, with elastic rebound from despair to relief,
    that men in the lower ranks of life do not usually form
    theories on the expensive virtues of the wine of France. But
    her mind was suddenly occupied by a fresh disaster.</p>

    <p>"Good gracious!" she cried. "The ham is ruined."</p>

    <p>It was burnt black. She prepared a fresh supply. When it was
    ready, Jenks was himself again. They ate in silence, and shared
    the remains of the bottle. The man idly wondered what was the
    <i>plat du jour</i> at the Savoy that evening. He remembered
    that the last time he was there he had called for <i>Jambon de
    York aux &eacute;pinards</i> and half a pint of Heidseck.</p>

    <p>"<i>Coelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currant</i>,"
    he thought. By a queer trick of memory he could recall the very
    page in Horace where this philosophical line occurs. It was in
    the eleventh epistle of the first book. A smile illumined his
    tired face.</p>

    <p>Iris was watchful. She had never in her life cooked even a
    potato or boiled an egg. The ham was her first attempt.</p>

    <p>"My cooking amuses you?" she demanded suspiciously.</p>

    <p>"It gratifies every sense," he murmured. "There is but one
    thing needful to complete my happiness."</p>

    <p>"And that is?"</p>

    <p>"Permission to smoke."</p>

    <p>"Smoke what?"</p>

    <p>He produced a steel box, tightly closed, and a pipe, "I will
    answer you in Byron's words," he said&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"'Sublime tobacco! which from east to west</p>

            <p>Cheers the tar's labour or the Turkman's rest.'"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"Your pockets are absolute shops," said the girl, delighted
    that his temper had improved. "What other stores do you carry
    about with you?"</p>

    <p>He lit his pipe and solemnly gave an inventory of his
    worldly goods. Beyond the items she had previously seen he
    could only enumerate a silver dollar, a very soiled and
    crumpled handkerchief, and a bit of tin. A box of Norwegian
    matches he threw away as useless, but Iris recovered them.</p>

    <p>"You never know what purpose they may serve," she said. In
    after days a weird significance was attached to this simple
    phrase.</p>

    <p>"Why do you carry about a bit of tin?" she went on.</p>

    <p>How the atmosphere of deception clung to him! Here was a man
    compelled to lie outrageously who, in happier years, had prided
    himself on scrupulous accuracy even in small things.</p>

    <p>"Plague upon it!" he silently protested. "Subterfuge and
    deceit are as much at home in this deserted island as in
    Mayfair."</p>

    <p>"I found it here, Miss Deane," he answered.</p>

    <p>Luckily she interpreted "here" as applying to the cave.</p>

    <p>"Let me see it. May I?"</p>

    <p>He handed it to her. She could make nothing of it, so
    together they puzzled over it. The sailor rubbed it with a
    mixture of kerosene and sand. Then figures and letters and a
    sort of diagram were revealed. At last they became
    decipherable. By exercising patient ingenuity some one had
    indented the metal with a sharp punch until the marks assumed
    this aspect (see cut, following page).</p>

    <p>Iris was quick-witted. "It is a plan of the island," she
    cried.</p>

    <p>"Also the latitude and the longitude."</p>

    <p>"What does 'J.S.' mean?"</p>

    <p>"Probably the initials of a man's name; let us say John
    Smith, for instance."</p>

    <p>"And the figures on the island, with the 'X' and the
    dot?"</p>

    <p>"I cannot tell you at present," he said. "I take it that the
    line across the island signifies this gap or canyon, and the
    small intersecting line the cave. But 32 divided by 1, and an
    'X' surmounted by a dot are cabalistic. They would cause even
    Sherlock Holmes to smoke at least two pipes. I have barely
    started one."</p>

    <p class="figcenter"><img alt="tin map"
         src="images/wm_4_2_th.png" width="300"></p>

    <br />

    <p>She ran to fetch a glowing stick to enable him to relight
    his pipe.</p>

    <p>"Why do you give me such nasty little digs?" she asked. "You
    need not have stopped smoking just because I stood close to
    you."</p>

    <p>"Really, Miss Deane&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"There, don't protest. I like the smell of that tobacco. I
    thought sailors invariably smoked rank, black stuff which they
    call thick twist."</p>

    <p>"I am a beginner, as a sailor. After a few more years before
    the mast I may hope to reach perfection."</p>

    <p>Their eyes exchanged a quaintly pleasant challenge. Thus the
    man&mdash;"She is determined to learn something of my past, but
    she will not succeed."</p>

    <p>And the woman&mdash;"The wretch! He is close as an oyster.
    But I will make him open his mouth, see if I don't."</p>

    <p>She reverted to the piece of tin. "It looks quite
    mysterious, like the things you read of in stories of pirates
    and buried treasure."</p>

    <p>"Yes," he admitted. "It is unquestionably a plan, a
    guidance, given to a person not previously acquainted with the
    island but cognizant of some fact connected with it.
    Unfortunately none of the buccaneers I can bring to mind
    frequented these seas. The poor beggar who left it here must
    have had some other motive than searching for a cache."</p>

    <p>"Did he dig the cave and the well, I wonder?"</p>

    <p>"Probably the former, but not the well. No man could do it
    unaided."</p>

    <p>"Why do you assume he was alone?"</p>

    <p>He strolled towards the fire to kick a stray log. "It is
    only idle speculation at the best, Miss Deane," he replied.
    "Would you like to help me to drag some timber up from the
    beach? If we get a few big planks we can build a fire that will
    last for hours. We want some extra clothes, too, and it will
    soon be dark."</p>

    <p>The request for co-operation gratified her. She complied
    eagerly, and without much exertion they hauled a respectable
    load of firewood to their new camping-ground. They also brought
    a number of coats to serve as coverings. Then Jenks tackled the
    lamp. Between the rust and the soreness of his index finger it
    was a most difficult operation to open it.</p>

    <p>Before the sun went down he succeeded, and made a wick by
    unraveling a few strands of wool from his jersey. When night
    fell, with the suddenness of the tropics, Iris was able to
    illuminate her small domain.</p>

    <p>They were both utterly tired and ready to drop with fatigue.
    The girl said "Good night," but instantly reappeared from
    behind the tarpaulin.</p>

    <p>"Am I to keep the lamp alight?" she inquired.</p>

    <p>"Please yourself, Miss Deane. Better not, perhaps. It will
    only burn four or five hours, any way."</p>

    <p>Soon the light vanished, and he lay down, his pipe between
    his teeth, close to the cave's entrance. Weary though he was,
    he could not sleep forthwith. His mind was occupied with the
    signs on the canister head.</p>

    <p>"32 divided by 1; an 'X' and a dot," he repeated several
    times. "What do they signify?"</p>

    <p>Suddenly he sat up, with every sense alert, and grabbed his
    revolver. Something impelled him to look towards the spot, a
    few feet away, where the skeleton was hidden. It was the
    rustling of a bird among the trees that had caught his ear.</p>

    <p>He thought of the white framework of a once powerful man,
    lying there among the bushes, abandoned, forgotten, horrific.
    Then he smothered a cry of surprise.</p>

    <p>"By Jove!" he muttered. "There is no 'X' and dot. That sign
    is meant for a skull and cross-bones. It lies exactly on the
    part of the island where we saw that queer-looking bald patch
    today. First thing tomorrow, before the girl awakes, I must
    examine that place."</p>

    <p>He resolutely stretched himself on his share of the
    spread-out coats, now thoroughly dried by sun and fire. In a
    minute he was sound asleep.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

    <h2>IRIS TO THE RESCUE</h2>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Before mine eyes in opposition sits</p>

            <p>Grim death."</p>

            <p class="i20">&mdash;<i>Milton</i>.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>He awoke to find the sun high in the heavens. Iris was
    preparing breakfast; a fine fire was crackling cheerfully, and
    the presiding goddess had so altered her appearance that the
    sailor surveyed her with astonishment.</p>

    <p>He noiselessly assumed a sitting posture, tucked his feet
    beneath him, and blinked. The girl's face was not visible from
    where he sat, and for a few seconds he thought he must surely
    be dreaming. She was attired in a neat navy-blue dress and
    smart blouse. Her white canvas shoes were replaced by strong
    leather boots. She was quite spick and span, this island
    Hebe.</p>

    <p>So soundly had he slept that his senses returned but slowly.
    At last he guessed what had happened. She had risen with the
    dawn, and, conquering her natural feeling of repulsion,
    selected from the store he accumulated yesterday some more
    suitable garments than those in which she escaped from the
    wreck.</p>

    <p>He quietly took stock of his own tattered condition, and
    passed a reflective hand over the stubble on his chin. In a few
    days his face would resemble a scrubbing-brush. In that
    mournful moment he would have exchanged even his pipe and
    tobacco-box&mdash;worth untold gold&mdash;for shaving tackle.
    Who can say why his thoughts took such trend? Twenty-four hours
    can effect great changes in the human mind if controlling
    influences are active.</p>

    <p>Then came a sharp revulsion of feeling. His name was
    Robert&mdash;a menial. He reached for his boots, and Iris heard
    him.</p>

    <p>"Good morning," she cried, smiling sweetly. "I thought you
    would never awake. I suppose you were very, very tired. You
    were lying so still that I ventured to peep at you a long time
    ago."</p>

    <p>"Thus might Titania peep at an ogre," he said.</p>

    <p>"You didn't look a bit like an ogre. You never do. You only
    try to talk like one&mdash;sometimes."</p>

    <p>"I claim a truce until after breakfast. If my rough
    compliment offends you, let me depend upon a more gentle tongue
    than my own&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i10">"'Her Angel's face</p>

            <p>As the great eye of heaven, shyned bright,</p>

            <p>And made a sunshine in the shady place.'</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"Those lines are surely appropriate. They come from the
    <i>Faerie Queene</i>."</p>

    <p>"They are very nice, but please wash quickly. The eggs will
    be hard."</p>

    <p>"Eggs!"</p>

    <p>"Yes; I made a collection among the trees. I tasted one of a
    lot that looked good. It was first-rate."</p>

    <p>He had not the moral courage to begin the day with a rebuke.
    She was irrepressible, but she really must not do these things.
    He smothered a sigh in the improvised basin which was placed
    ready for him.</p>

    <p>Miss Deane had prepared a capital meal. Of course the ham
    and biscuits still bulked large in the bill of fare, but there
    were boiled eggs, fried bananas and an elderly cocoanut. These
    things, supplemented by clear cold water, were not so bad for a
    couple of castaways, hundreds of miles from everywhere.</p>

    <p>For the life of him the man could not refrain from
    displaying the conversational art in which he excelled. Their
    talk dealt with Italy, Egypt, India. He spoke with the ease of
    culture and enthusiasm. Once he slipped into anecdote
    <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the helplessness of British soldiers
    in any matter outside the scope of the King's Regulations.</p>

    <p>"I remember," he said, "seeing a cavalry subaltern and the
    members of an escort sitting, half starved, on a number of bags
    piled up in the Suakin desert. And what do you think were in
    the bags?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know," said Iris, keenly alert for deductions.</p>

    <p>"Biscuits! They thought the bags contained patent fodder
    until I enlightened them."</p>

    <p>It was on the tip of her tongue to pounce on him with the
    comment: "Then you have been an officer in the army." But she
    forbore. She had guessed this earlier. Yet the mischievous
    light in her eyes defied control. He was warned in time and
    pulled himself up short.</p>

    <p>"You read my face like a book," she cried, with a delightful
    little <i>moue</i>.</p>

    <p>"No printed page was ever so&mdash;legible."</p>

    <p>He was going to say "fascinating," but checked the impulse.
    He went on with brisk affectation&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Now, Miss Deane, we have gossiped too long. I am a laggard
    this morning; but before starting work, I have a few serious
    remarks to make."</p>

    <p>"More digs?" she inquired saucily.</p>

    <p>"I repudiate 'digs.' In the first place, you must not make
    any more experiments in the matter of food. The eggs were a
    wonderful effort, but, flattered by success, you may poison
    yourself."</p>

    <p>"Secondly?"</p>

    <p>"You must never pass out of my sight without carrying a
    revolver, not so much for defence, but as a signal. Did you
    take one when you went bird's-nesting?"</p>

    <p>"No. Why?"</p>

    <p>There was a troubled look in his eyes when he
    answered&mdash;</p>

    <p>"It is best to tell you at once that before help reaches us
    we may be visited by cruel and blood-thirsty savages. I would
    not even mention this if it were a remote contingency. As
    matters stand, you ought to know that such a thing may happen.
    Let us trust in God's goodness that assistance may come soon.
    The island has seemingly been deserted for many months, and
    therein lies our best chance of escape. But I am obliged to
    warn you lest you should be taken unawares."</p>

    <p>Iris was serious enough now.</p>

    <p>"How do you know that such danger threatens us?" she
    demanded.</p>

    <p>He countered readily. "Because I happen to have read a good
    deal about the China Sea and its frequenters," he said. "I am
    the last man in the world to alarm you needlessly. All I mean
    to convey is that certain precautions should be taken against a
    risk that is possible, not probable. No more."</p>

    <p>She could not repress a shudder. The aspect of nature was so
    beneficent that evil deeds seemed to be out of place in that
    fair isle. Birds were singing around them. The sun was mounting
    into a cloudless sky. The gale had passed away into a pleasant
    breeze, and the sea was now rippling against the distant reef
    with peaceful melody.</p>

    <p>The sailor wanted to tell her that he would defend her
    against a host of savages if he were endowed with many lives,
    but he was perforce tongue-tied. He even reviled himself for
    having spoken, but she saw the anguish in his face, and her
    woman's heart acknowledged him as her protector, her
    shield.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Jenks," she said simply, "we are in God's hands. I put
    my trust in Him, and in you. I am hopeful, nay more, confident.
    I thank you for what you have done, for all that you will do.
    If you cannot preserve me from threatening perils no man could,
    for you are as brave and gallant a gentleman as lives on the
    earth today."</p>

    <p>Now, the strange feature of this extraordinary and
    unexpected outburst of pent-up emotion was that the girl
    pronounced his name with the slightly emphasized accentuation
    of one who knew it to be a mere disguise. The man was so taken
    aback by her declaration of faith that the minor incident,
    though it did not escape him, was smothered in a tumult of
    feeling.</p>

    <p>He could not trust himself to speak. He rose hastily and
    seized the axe to deliver a murderous assault upon a sago palm
    that stood close at hand.</p>

    <p>Iris was the first to recover a degree of self-possession.
    For a moment she had bared her soul. With reaction came a
    sensitive shrinking. Her British temperament, no less than her
    delicate nature, disapproved these sentimental displays. She
    wanted to box her own ears.</p>

    <p>With innate tact she took a keen interest in the felling of
    the tree.</p>

    <p>"What do you want it for?" she inquired, when the sturdy
    trunk creaked and fell.</p>

    <p>Jenks felt better now.</p>

    <p>"This is a change of diet," he explained. "No; we don't boil
    the leaves or nibble the bark. When I split this palm open you
    will find that the interior is full of pith. I will cut it out
    for you, and then it will be your task to knead it with water
    after well washing it, pick out all the fiber, and finally
    permit the water to evaporate. In a couple of days the residuum
    will become a white powder, which, when boiled, is sago."</p>

    <p>"Good gracious!" said Iris.</p>

    <p>"The story sounds unconvincing, but I believe I am correct.
    It is worth a trial."</p>

    <p>"I should have imagined that sago grew on a stalk like rice
    or wheat."</p>

    <p>"Or Topsy!"</p>

    <p>She laughed. A difficult situation had passed without undue
    effort. Unhappily the man reopened it. Whilst using a crowbar
    as a wedge he endeavored to put matters on a straightforward
    footing.</p>

    <p>"A little while ago," he said, "you seemed to imply that I
    had assumed the name of Jenks."</p>

    <p>But Miss Deane's confidential mood had gone. "Nothing of the
    kind," she said, coldly. "I think Jenks is an excellent
    name."</p>

    <p>She regretted the words even as they fell from her lips. The
    sailor gave a mighty wrench with the bar, splitting the log to
    its clustering leaves.</p>

    <p>"You are right," he said. "It is distinctive, brief,
    dogmatic. I cling to it passionately."</p>

    <p>Soon afterwards, leaving Iris to the manufacture of sago, he
    went to the leeward side of the island, a search for turtles
    being his ostensible object. When the trees hid him he
    quickened his pace and turned to the left, in order to explore
    the cavity marked on the tin with a skull and cross-bones. To
    his surprise he hit upon the remnants of a roadway&mdash;that
    is, a line through the wood where there were no well-grown
    trees, where the ground bore traces of humanity in the shape of
    a wrinkled and mildewed pair of Chinese boots, a wooden sandal,
    even the decayed remains of a palki, or litter.</p>

    <p>At last he reached the edge of the pit, and the sight that
    met his eyes held him spellbound.</p>

    <p>The labor of many hands had torn a chasm, a quarry, out of
    the side of the hill. Roughly circular in shape, it had a
    diameter of perhaps a hundred feet, and at its deepest part,
    towards the cliff, it ran to a depth of forty feet. On the
    lower side, where the sailor stood, it descended rapidly for
    some fifteen feet.</p>

    <p>Grasses, shrubs, plants of every variety, grew in profusion
    down the steep slopes, wherever seeds could find precarious
    nurture, until a point was reached about ten or eleven feet
    from the bottom. There all vegetation ceased as if forbidden to
    cross a magic circle.</p>

    <p>Below this belt the place was a charnel-house. The bones of
    men and animals mingled in weird confusion. Most were mere
    skeletons. A few bodies&mdash;nine the sailor counted&mdash;yet
    preserved some resemblance of humanity. These latter were
    scattered among the older relics. They wore the clothes of
    Dyaks. Characteristic hats and weapons denoted their
    nationality. The others, the first harvest of this modern
    Golgotha, might have been Chinese coolies. When the sailor's
    fascinated vision could register details he distinguished
    yokes, baskets, odd-looking spades and picks strewed amidst the
    bones. The animals were all of one type, small, lanky, with
    long pointed skulls. At last he spied a withered hoof. They
    were pigs.</p>

    <p>Over all lay a thick coating of fine sand, deposited from
    the eddying winds that could never reach the silent depths. The
    place was gruesome, horribly depressing. Jenks broke out into a
    clammy perspiration. He seemed to be looking at the secrets of
    the grave.</p>

    <p>At last his superior intelligence asserted itself. His brain
    became clearer, recovered its power of analysis. He began to
    criticize, reflect, and this is the theory he
    evolved&mdash;</p>

    <p>Some one, long ago, had discovered valuable minerals in the
    volcanic rock. Mining operations were in full blast when the
    extinct volcano took its revenge upon the human ants gnawing at
    its vitals and smothered them by a deadly outpouring of
    carbonic acid gas, the bottled-up poison of the ages. A horde
    of pigs, running wild over the island&mdash;placed there, no
    doubt, by Chinese fishers&mdash;had met the same fate whilst
    intent on dreadful orgy.</p>

    <p>Then there came a European, who knew how the anhydrate gas,
    being heavier than the surrounding air, settled like water in
    that terrible hollow. He, too, had striven to wrest the
    treasure from the stone by driving a tunnel into the cliff. He
    had partly succeeded and had gone away, perhaps to obtain help,
    after crudely registering his knowledge on the lid of a tin
    canister. This, again, probably fell into the hands of another
    man, who, curious but unconvinced, caused himself to be set
    ashore on this desolate spot, with a few inadequate stores.
    Possibly he had arranged to be taken off within a fixed
    time.</p>

    <p>But a sampan, laden with Dyak pirates, came first, and the
    intrepid explorer's bones rested near the well, whilst his head
    had gone to decorate the hut of some fierce village chief. The
    murderers, after burying their own dead&mdash;for the white man
    fought hard, witness the empty cartridges&mdash;searched the
    island. Some of them, ignorantly inquisitive, descended into
    the hollow. They remained there. The others, superstitious
    barbarians, fled for their lives, embarking so hastily that
    they took from the cave neither tools nor oil, though they
    would greatly prize these articles.</p>

    <p>Such was the tragic web he spun, a compound of fact and
    fancy. It explained all perplexities save one. What did "32
    divided by 1" mean? Was there yet another fearsome riddle
    awaiting solution?</p>

    <p>And then his thoughts flew to Iris. Happen what might, her
    bright picture was seldom absent from his brain. Suppose,
    egg-hunting, she had stumbled across this Valley of Death! How
    could he hope to keep it hidden from her? Was not the ghastly
    knowledge better than the horror of a chance ramble through the
    wood and the shock of discovery, nay, indeed, the risk of a
    catastrophe?</p>

    <p>He was a man who relieved his surcharged feelings with
    strong language&mdash;a habit of recent acquisition. He
    indulged in it now and felt better. He rushed back through the
    trees until he caught sight of Iris industriously kneading the
    sago pith in one of those most useful dish-covers.</p>

    <p>He called to her, led her wondering to the track, and
    pointed out the fatal quarry, but in such wise that she could
    not look inside it.</p>

    <p>"You remember that round hole we saw from the summit rock?"
    he said. "Well, it is full of carbonic acid gas, to breathe
    which means unconsciousness and death. It gives no warning to
    the inexperienced. It is rather pleasant than otherwise.
    Promise me you will never come near this place again."</p>

    <p>Now, Iris, too, had been thinking deeply. Robert Jenks
    bulked large in her day-dreams. Her nerves were not yet quite
    normal. There was a catch in her throat as she
    answered&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I don't want to die. Of course I will keep away. What a
    horrid island this is! Yet it might be a paradise."</p>

    <p>She bit her lip to suppress her tears, but, being the Eve in
    this garden, she continued&mdash;</p>

    <p>"How did you find out? Is there
    anything&mdash;nasty&mdash;in there?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, the remains of animals, and other things. I would not
    have told you were it not imperative."</p>

    <p>"Are you keeping other secrets from me?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, quite a number."</p>

    <p>He managed to conjure up a smile, and the ruse was
    effective. She applied the words to his past history.</p>

    <p>"I hope they will not be revealed so dramatically," she
    said.</p>

    <p>"You never can tell," he answered. They were in prophetic
    vein that morning. They returned in silence to the cave.</p>

    <p>"I wish to go inside, with a lamp. May I?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"Certainly. Why not?"</p>

    <p>He had an odd trick of blushing, this bronzed man with a
    gnarled soul. He could not frame a satisfactory reply, but
    busied himself in refilling the lamp.</p>

    <p>"May I come too?" she demanded.</p>

    <p>He flung aside the temptation to answer her in kind, merely
    assenting, with an explanation of his design. When the lamp was
    in order he held it close to the wall and conducted a
    systematic survey. The geological fault which favored the
    construction of the tunnel seemed to diverge to the left at the
    further end. The "face" of the rock exhibited the marks of
    persistent labor. The stone had been hewn away by main force
    when the dislocation of strata ceased to be helpful.</p>

    <p>His knowledge was limited on the subject, yet Jenks believed
    that the material here was a hard limestone rather than the
    external basalt. Searching each inch with the feeble light, he
    paused once, with an exclamation.</p>

    <p>"What is it?" cried Iris.</p>

    <p>"I cannot be certain," he said, doubtfully. "Would you mind
    holding the lamp whilst I use a crowbar?"</p>

    <p>In the stone was visible a thin vein, bluish white in color.
    He managed to break off a fair-sized lump containing a
    well-defined specimen of the foreign metal.</p>

    <p>They hurried into the open air and examined the fragment
    with curious eyes. The sailor picked it with his knife, and the
    substance in the vein came off in laminated layers, small,
    brittle scales.</p>

    <p>"Is it silver?" Iris was almost excited.</p>

    <p>"I do not think so. I am no expert, but I have a vague
    idea&mdash;I have seen&mdash;"</p>

    <p>He wrinkled his brows and pressed away the furrows with his
    hand, that physical habit of his when perplexed.</p>

    <p>"I have it," he cried. "It is antimony."</p>

    <p>Miss Deane pursed her lips in disdain. Antimony! What was
    antimony?</p>

    <p>"So much fuss for nothing," she said.</p>

    <p>"It is used in alloys and medicines," he explained. "To us
    it is useless."</p>

    <p>He threw the piece of rock contemptuously among the bushes.
    But, being thorough in all that he undertook, he returned to
    the cave and again conducted an inquisition. The silver-hued
    vein became more strongly marked at the point where it
    disappeared downwards into a collection of rubble and sand.
    That was all. Did men give their toil, their lives, for this?
    So it would appear. Be that as it might, he had a more pressing
    work. If the cave still held a secret it must remain there.</p>

    <p>Iris had gone back to her sago-kneading. Necessity had made
    the lady a bread-maid.</p>

    <p>"Fifteen hundred years of philology bridged by
    circumstance," mused Jenks. "How Max M&uuml;ller would have
    reveled in the incident!"</p>

    <p>Shouldering the axe he walked to the beach. The tide was low
    and the circular sweep of the reef showed up irregularly, its
    black outlines sticking out of the vividly green water like
    jagged teeth.</p>

    <p>Much d&eacute;bris from the steamer was lying high and dry.
    It was an easy task for an athletic man to reach the palm tree,
    yet the sailor hesitated, with almost imperceptible qualms.</p>

    <p>"A baited rat-trap," he muttered. Then he quickened his
    pace. With the first active spring from rock to rock his
    unacknowledged doubts vanished. He might find stores of
    priceless utility. The reflection inspired him. Jumping and
    climbing like a cat, in two minutes he was near the tree.</p>

    <p>He could now see the true explanation of its growth in a
    seemingly impossible place. Here the bed of the sea bulged
    upwards in a small sand cay, which silted round the base of a
    limestone rock, so different in color and formation from the
    coral reef. Nature, whose engineering contrivances can force
    springs to mountain tops, managed to deliver to this isolated
    refuge a sufficient supply of water to nourish the palm, and
    the roots, firmly lodged in deep crevices, were well protected
    from the waves.</p>

    <p>Between the sailor and the tree intervened a small stretch
    of shallow water. Landward this submerged saddle shelved
    steeply into the lagoon. Although the water in the cove was
    twenty fathoms in depth, its crystal clearness was remarkable.
    The bottom, composed of marvelously white sand and broken
    coral, rendered other objects conspicuous. He could see plenty
    of fish, but not a single shark, whilst on the inner slope of
    the reef was plainly visible the destroyed fore part of the
    <i>Sirdar</i>, which had struck beyond the tree, relatively to
    his present standpoint. He had wondered why no boats were cast
    ashore. Now he saw the reason. Three of them were still
    fastened to the davits and carried down with the hull.</p>

    <p>Seaward the water was not so clear. The waves created
    patches of foam, and long submarine plants swayed gently in the
    undercurrent.</p>

    <p>To reach Palm-tree Rock&mdash;anticipating its subsequent
    name&mdash;he must cross a space of some thirty feet and wade
    up to his waist.</p>

    <p>He made the passage with ease.</p>

    <p>Pitched against the hole of the tree was a long narrow case,
    very heavy, iron-clamped; and marked with letters in black
    triangles and the broad arrow of the British Government.</p>

    <p>"Rifles, by all the gods!" shouted the sailor. They were
    really by the Enfield Small Arms Manufactory, but his glee at
    this stroke of luck might be held to excuse a verbal
    inaccuracy.</p>

    <p>The <i>Sirdar</i> carried a consignment of arms and
    ammunition from Hong Kong to Singapore. Providence had decreed
    that a practically inexhaustible store of cartridges should be
    hurled across the lagoon to the island. And here were
    Lee-Metfords enough to equip half a company. He would not risk
    the precious axe in an attempt to open the case. He must go
    back for a crowbar.</p>

    <p>What else was there in this storehouse, thrust by Neptune
    from the ocean bed? A chest of tea, seemingly undamaged. Three
    barrels of flour, utterly ruined. A saloon chair, smashed from
    its pivot. A battered chronometer. For the rest, fragments of
    timber intermingled with pulverized coral and broken
    crockery.</p>

    <p>A little further on, the deep-water entrance to the lagoon
    curved between sunken rocks. On one of them rested the
    <i>Sirdar's</i> huge funnel. The north-west section of the reef
    was bare. Among the wreckage he found a coil of stout rope and
    a pulley. He instantly conceived the idea of constructing an
    aerial line to ferry the chest of tea across the channel he had
    forded.</p>

    <p>He threaded the pulley with the rope and climbed the tree,
    adding a touch of artistic completeness to the ruin of his
    trousers by the operation. He had fastened the pulley high up
    the trunk before he realized how much more simple it would be
    to break open the chest where it lay and transport its contents
    in small parcels.</p>

    <p>He laughed lightly. "I am becoming addleheaded," he said to
    himself. "Anyhow, now the job is done I may as well make use of
    it."</p>

    <p>Recoiling the rope-ends, he cast them across to the reef. In
    such small ways do men throw invisible dice with death. With
    those two lines he would, within a few fleeting seconds, drag
    himself back from eternity.</p>

    <p>Picking up the axe, he carelessly stepped into the water,
    not knowing that Iris, having welded the incipient sago into a
    flat pancake, had strolled to the beach and was watching
    him.</p>

    <p>The water was hardly above his knees when there came a
    swirling rush from the seaweed. A long tentacle shot out like a
    lasso and gripped his right leg. Another coiled round his
    waist.</p>

    <p>"My God!" he gurgled, as a horrid sucker closed over his
    mouth and nose. He was in the grip of a devil-fish.</p>

    <p>A deadly sensation of nausea almost overpowered him, but the
    love of life came to his aid, and he tore the suffocating
    feeler from his face. Then the axe whirled, and one of the
    eight arms of the octopus lost some of its length. Yet a fourth
    flung itself around his left ankle. A few feet away, out of
    range of the axe, and lifting itself bodily out of the water,
    was the dread form of the cuttle, apparently all head, with
    distended gills and monstrous eyes.</p>

    <p>The sailor's feet were planted wide apart. With frenzied
    effort he hacked at the murderous tentacles, but the water
    hindered him, and he was forced to lean back, in superhuman
    strain, to avoid losing his balance. If once this terrible
    assailant got him down he knew he was lost. The very need to
    keep his feet prevented him from attempting to deal a mortal
    blow.</p>

    <p>The cuttle was anchored by three of its tentacles. Its
    remaining arm darted with sinuous activity to again clutch the
    man's face or neck. With the axe he smote madly at the curling
    feeler, diverting its aim time and again, but failing to
    deliver an effective stroke.</p>

    <p>With agonized prescience the sailor knew that he was
    yielding. Were the devil-fish a giant of its tribe he could not
    have held out so long. As it was, the creature could afford to
    wait, strengthening its grasp, tightening its coils, pulling
    and pumping at its prey with remorseless certainty.</p>

    <p>He was nearly spent. In a paroxysm of despair he resolved to
    give way, and with one mad effort seek to bury the axe in the
    monster's brain. But ere he could execute this fatal
    project&mdash;for the cuttle would have instantly swept him
    into the trailing weeds&mdash;five revolver shots rang out in
    quick succession. Iris had reached the nearest rock.</p>

    <p>The third bullet gave the octopus cause to reflect. It
    squirted forth a torrent of dark-colored fluid. Instantly the
    water became black, opaque. The tentacle flourishing in air
    thrashed the surface with impotent fury; that around Jenks's
    waist grew taut and rigid. The axe flashed with the inspiration
    of hope. Another arm was severed; the huge dismembered coil
    slackened and fell away.</p>

    <p>Yet was he anchored immovably. He turned to look at Iris.
    She never forgot the fleeting expression of his face. So might
    Lazarus have looked from the tomb.</p>

    <p>"The rope!" she screamed, dropping the revolver and seizing
    the loose ends lying at her feet.</p>

    <p>She drew them tight and leaned back, pulling with all her
    strength. The sailor flung the axe to the rocks and grasped the
    two ropes. He raised himself and plunged wildly. He was free.
    With two convulsive strides he was at the girl's side.</p>

    <p>He stumbled to a boulder and dropped in complete collapse.
    After a time he felt Iris's hand placed timidly on his
    shoulder. He raised his head and saw her eyes shining.</p>

    <p>"Thank you," he said. "We are quits now."</p>
    <hr>
    <a name="CHAPTER_VI"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

    <h2>SOME EXPLANATIONS</h2>

    <p>Fierce emotions are necessarily transient, but for the hour
    they exhaust the psychic capacity. The sailor had gone through
    such mental stress before it was yet noon that he was benumbed,
    wholly incapable of further sensation. Seneca tells how the
    island of Theres&aelig;a arose in a moment from the sea,
    thereby astounding ancient mariners, as well it might. Had this
    manifestation been repeated within a cable's length from the
    reef, Jenks was in mood to accept it as befitting the new order
    of things.</p>

    <p>Being in good condition, he soon recovered his physical
    powers. He was outwardly little the worse for the encounter
    with the devil-fish. The skin around his mouth was sore. His
    waist and legs were bruised. One sweep of the axe had cut clean
    through the bulging leather of his left boot without touching
    the flesh. In a word, he was practically uninjured.</p>

    <p>He had the doglike habit of shaking himself at the close of
    a fray. He did so now when he stood up. Iris showed clearer
    signs of the ordeal. Her face was drawn and haggard, the pupils
    of her eyes dilated. She was gazing into depths, illimitable,
    unexplored. Compassion awoke at sight of her.</p>

    <p>"Come," said Jenks, gently. "Let us get back to the
    island."</p>

    <p>He quietly resumed predominance, helping her over the rough
    pathway of the reef, almost lifting her when the difficulties
    were great.</p>

    <p>He did not ask her how it happened that she came so speedily
    to his assistance. Enough that she had done it, daring all for
    his sake. She was weak and trembling. With the acute vision of
    the soul she saw again, and yet again, the deadly malice of the
    octopus, the divine despair of the man.</p>

    <p>Reaching the firm sand, she could walk alone. She limped.
    Instantly her companion's blunted emotions quickened into life.
    He caught her arm and said hoarsely&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Are you hurt in any way?"</p>

    <p>The question brought her back from dreamland. A waking
    nightmare was happily shattered into dim fragments. She even
    strove to smile unconcernedly.</p>

    <p>"It is nothing," she murmured. "I stumbled on the rocks.
    There is no sprain. Merely a blow, a bit of skin rubbed off,
    above my ankle."</p>

    <p>"Let me carry you."</p>

    <p>"The idea! Carry me! I will race you to the cave."</p>

    <p>It was no idle jest. She wanted to run&mdash;to get away
    from that inky blotch in the green water.</p>

    <p>"You are sure it is a trifle?"</p>

    <p>"Quite sure. My stocking chafes a little; that is all. See,
    I will show you."</p>

    <p>She stooped, and with the quick skill of woman, rolled down
    the stocking on her right leg. Modestly daring, she stretched
    out her foot and slightly lifted her dress. On the outer side
    of the tapering limb was an ugly bruise, scratched deeply by
    the coral.</p>

    <p>He exhibited due surgical interest. His manner, his words,
    became professional.</p>

    <p>"We will soon put that right," he said. "A strip off your
    muslin dress, soaked in brandy, will&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Brandy!" she exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"Yes; we have some, you know. Brandy is a great tip for
    bruised wounds. It can be applied both ways, inside and
    out."</p>

    <p>This was better. They were steadily drifting back to the
    commonplace. Whilst she stitched together some muslin strips he
    knocked the head off a bottle of brandy. They each drank a
    small quantity, and the generous spirit brought color to their
    wan cheeks. The sailor showed Iris how to fasten a bandage by
    twisting the muslin round the upper part of his boot. For the
    first time she saw the cut made by the axe.</p>

    <p>"Did&mdash;the thing&mdash;grip you there?" she nervously
    inquired.</p>

    <p>"There, and elsewhere. All over at once, it felt like. The
    beast attacked me with five arms."</p>

    <p>She shuddered. "I don't know how you could fight it," she
    said. "How strong, how brave you must be."</p>

    <p>This amused him. "The veriest coward will try to save his
    own life," he answered. "If you use such adjectives to me, what
    words can I find to do justice to you, who dared to come close
    to such a vile-looking creature and kill it. I must thank my
    stars that you carried the revolver."</p>

    <p>"Ah!" she said, "that reminds me. You do not practice what
    you preach. I found your pistol lying on the stone in the cave.
    That is one reason why I followed you."</p>

    <p>It was quite true. He laid the weapon aside when delving at
    the rock, and forgot to replace it in his belt.</p>

    <p>"It was stupid of me," he admitted; "but I am not
    sorry."</p>

    <p>"Why?"</p>

    <p>"Because, as it is, I owe you my life."</p>

    <p>"You owe me nothing," she snapped. "It is very thoughtless
    of you to run such risks. What will become of me if anything
    happens to you? My point of view is purely selfish, you
    see."</p>

    <p>"Quite so. Purely selfish." He smiled sadly. "Selfish people
    of your type are somewhat rare, Miss Deane."</p>

    <p>Not a conversation worth noting, perhaps, save in so far as
    it is typical of the trite utterances of people striving to
    recover from some tremendous ordeal. Epigrams delivered at the
    foot of the scaffold have always been carefully prepared
    beforehand.</p>

    <p>The bandage was ready; one end was well soaked in brandy.
    She moved towards the cave, but he cried&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Wait one minute. I want to get a couple of crowbars."</p>

    <p>"What for?"</p>

    <p>"I must go back there." He jerked his head in the direction
    of the reef. She uttered a little sob of dismay.</p>

    <p>"I will incur no danger this time," he explained. "I found
    rifles there. We must have them; they may mean salvation."</p>

    <p>When Iris was determined about anything, her chin dimpled.
    It puckered delightfully now.</p>

    <p>"I will come with you," she announced.</p>

    <p>"Very well. I will wait for you. The tide will serve for
    another hour."</p>

    <p>He knew he had decided rightly. She could not bear to be
    alone&mdash;yet. Soon the bandage was adjusted and they
    returned to the reef. Scrambling now with difficulty over the
    rough and dangerous track, Iris was secretly amazed by the
    remembrance of the daring activity she displayed during her
    earlier passage along the same precarious roadway.</p>

    <p>Then she darted from rock to rock with the fearless
    certainty of a chamois. Her only stumble was caused, she
    recollected, by an absurd effort to avoid wetting her dress.
    She laughed nervously when they reached the place. This time
    Jenks lifted her across the intervening channel.</p>

    <p>"Is this the spot where you fell?" he asked, tenderly.</p>

    <p>"Yes; how did you guess it?"</p>

    <p>"I read it in your eyes."</p>

    <p>"Then please do not read my eyes, but look where you are
    going."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps I was doing that too," he said.</p>

    <p>They were standing on the landward side of the shallow water
    in which he fought the octopus.</p>

    <p>Already the dark fluid emitted by his assailant in its final
    discomfiture was passing away, owing to the slight movement of
    the tide.</p>

    <p>Iris was vaguely conscious of a double meaning in his words.
    She did not trouble to analyze them. All she knew was that the
    man's voice conveyed a subtle acknowledgment of her feminine
    divinity. The resultant thrill of happiness startled, even
    dismayed her. This incipient flirtation must be put a stop to
    instantly.</p>

    <p>"Now that you have brought me here with so much difficulty,
    what are you going to do?" she said. "It will be madness for
    you to attempt to ford that passage again. Where there is one
    of those horrible things there are others, I suppose."</p>

    <p>Jenks smiled. Somehow he knew that this strict adherence to
    business was a cloak for her real thoughts. Already these two
    were able to dispense with spoken word.</p>

    <p>But he sedulously adopted her pretext.</p>

    <p>"That is one reason why I brought the crowbars," he
    explained. "If you will sit down for a little while I will have
    everything properly fixed."</p>

    <p>He delved with one of the bars until it lodged in a crevice
    of the coral. Then a few powerful blows with the back of the
    axe wedged it firmly enough to bear any ordinary strain. The
    rope-ends reeved through the pulley on the tree were lying
    where they fell from the girl's hand at the close of the
    struggle. He deftly knotted them to the rigid bar, and a few
    rapid turns of a piece of wreckage passed between the two lines
    strung them into a tautness that could not be attained by any
    amount of pulling.</p>

    <p>Iris watched the operation in silence. The sailor always
    looked at his best when hard at work. The half-sullen, wholly
    self-contained expression left his face, which lit up with
    enthusiasm and concentrated intelligence. That which he essayed
    he did with all his might. Will power and physical force worked
    harmoniously. She had never before seen such a man. At such
    moments her admiration of him was unbounded.</p>

    <p>He, toiling with steady persistence, felt not the inward
    spur which sought relief in speech, but Iris was compelled to
    say something.</p>

    <p>"I suppose," she commented with an air of much wisdom, "you
    are contriving an overhead railway for the safe transit of
    yourself and the goods?"</p>

    <p>"Y&mdash;yes."</p>

    <p>"Why are you so doubtful about it?"</p>

    <p>"Because I personally intended to walk across. The ropes
    will serve to convey the packages."</p>

    <p>She rose imperiously. "I absolutely forbid you to enter the
    water again. Such a suggestion on your part is quite shameful.
    You are taking a grave risk for no very great gain that I can
    see, and if anything happens to you I shall be left all alone
    in this awful place."</p>

    <p>She could think of no better argument. Her only resource was
    a woman's expedient&mdash;a plea for protection against
    threatening ills.</p>

    <p>The sailor seemed to be puzzled how best to act.</p>

    <p>"Miss Deane," he said, "there is no such serious danger as
    you imagine. Last time the cuttle caught me napping. He will
    not do so again. Those rifles I must have. If it will serve to
    reassure you, I will go along the line myself."</p>

    <p>He made this concession grudgingly. In very truth, if danger
    still lurked in the neighboring sea, he would be far less able
    to avoid it whilst clinging to a rope that sagged with his
    weight, and thus working a slow progress across the channel,
    than if he were on his feet and prepared to make a rush
    backwards or forwards.</p>

    <p>Not until Iris watched him swinging along with vigorous
    overhead clutches did this phase of the undertaking occur to
    her.</p>

    <p>"Stop!" she screamed.</p>

    <p>He let go and dropped into the water, turning towards
    her.</p>

    <p>"What is the matter now?" he said.</p>

    <p>"Go on; do!"</p>

    <p>He stood meekly on the further side to listen to her
    rating.</p>

    <p>"You knew all the time that it would be better to walk, yet
    to please me you adopted an absurdly difficult method. Why did
    you do it?"</p>

    <p>"You have answered your own question."</p>

    <p>"Well, I am very, very angry with you."</p>

    <p>"I'll tell you what," he said, "if you will forgive me I
    will try and jump back. I once did nineteen feet three inches
    in&mdash;er&mdash;in a meadow, but it makes such a difference
    when you look at a stretch of water the same width."</p>

    <p>"I wish you would not stand there talking nonsense. The tide
    will be over the reef in half an hour," she cried.</p>

    <p>Without another word he commenced operations. There was
    plenty of rope, and the plan he adopted was simplicity itself.
    When each package was securely fastened he attached it to a
    loop that passed over the line stretched from the tree to the
    crowbar. To this loop he tied the lightest rope he could find
    and threw the other end to Iris. By pulling slightly she was
    able to land at her feet even the cumbrous rifle-chest, for the
    traveling angle was so acute that the heavier the article the
    more readily it sought the lower level.</p>

    <p>They toiled in silence until Jenks could lay hands on
    nothing more of value. Then, observing due care, he quickly
    passed the channel. For an instant the girl gazed affrightedly
    at the sea until the sailor stood at her side again.</p>

    <p>"You see," he said, "you have scared every cuttle within
    miles." And he thought that he would give many years of his
    life to be able to take her in his arms and kiss away her
    anxiety.</p>

    <p>But the tide had turned; in a few minutes the reef would be
    partly submerged. To carry the case of rifles to the mainland
    was a manifestly impossible feat, so Jenks now did that which,
    done earlier, would have saved him some labor&mdash;he broke
    open the chest, and found that the weapons were apparently in
    excellent order.</p>

    <p>He snapped the locks and squinted down the barrels of half a
    dozen to test them. These he laid on one side. Then he rapidly
    constructed a small raft from loose timbers, binding them
    roughly with rope, and to this argosy he fastened the box of
    tea, the barrels of flour, the broken saloon-chair, and other
    small articles which might be of use. He avoided any difficulty
    in launching the raft by building it close to the water's edge.
    When all was ready the rising tide floated it for him; he
    secured it to his longest rope, and gave it a vigorous push off
    into the lagoon. Then he slung four rifles across his
    shoulders, asked Iris to carry the remaining two in like
    manner, and began to manoeuvre the raft landwards.</p>

    <p>"Whilst you land the goods I will prepare dinner," announced
    the girl.</p>

    <p>"Please be careful not to slip again on the rocks," he
    said.</p>

    <p>"Indeed I will. My ankle gives me a reminder at each
    step."</p>

    <p>"I was more concerned about the rifles. If you fell you
    might damage them, and the incoming tide will so hopelessly
    rust those I leave behind that they will be useless."</p>

    <p>She laughed. This assumption at brutality no longer deceived
    her.</p>

    <p>"I will preserve them at any cost, though with six in our
    possession there is a margin for accidents. However, to
    reassure you, I will go back quickly. If I fall a second time
    you will still be able to replace any deficiencies in our
    armament."</p>

    <p>Before he could protest she started off at a run, jumping
    lightly from rock to rock, though the effort cost her a good
    deal of pain. Disregarding his shouts, she persevered until she
    stood safely on the sands. Then saucily waving a farewell, she
    set off towards the cave.</p>

    <p>Had she seen the look of fierce despair that settled down
    upon Jenks's face as he turned to his task of guiding the raft
    ashore she might have wondered what it meant. In any case she
    would certainly have behaved differently.</p>

    <p>By the time the sailor had safely landed his cargo Iris had
    cooked their midday meal. She achieved a fresh culinary
    triumph. The eggs were fried!</p>

    <p>"I am seriously thinking of trying to boil a ham," she
    stated gravely. "Have you any idea how long it takes to cook
    one properly?"</p>

    <p>"A quarter of an hour for each pound."</p>

    <p>"Admirable! But we can measure neither hours nor
    pounds."</p>

    <p>"I think we can do both. I will construct a balance of some
    kind. Then, with a ham slung to one end, and a rifle and some
    cartridges to the other, I will tell you the weight of the ham
    to an ounce. To ascertain the time, I have already determined
    to fashion a sun-dial. I remember the requisite divisions with
    reasonable accuracy, and a little observation will enable us to
    correct any mistakes."</p>

    <p>"You are really very clever, Mr. Jenks," said Iris, with
    childlike candor. "Have you spent several years of your life in
    preparing for residence on a desert island?"</p>

    <p>"Something of the sort. I have led a queer kind of
    existence, full of useless purposes. Fate has driven me into a
    corner where my odds and ends of knowledge are actually
    valuable. Such accidents make men millionaires."</p>

    <p>"Useless purposes!" she repeated. "I can hardly credit that.
    One uses such a phrase to describe fussy people, alive with
    foolish activity. Your worst enemy would not place you in such
    a category."</p>

    <p>"My worst enemy made the phrase effective at any rate, Miss
    Deane."</p>

    <p>"You mean that he ruined your career?"</p>

    <p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;yes. I suppose that describes the
    position with fair accuracy."</p>

    <p>"Was he a very great scoundrel?"</p>

    <p>"He was, and is."</p>

    <p>Jenks spoke with quiet bitterness. The girl's words had
    evoked a sudden flood of recollection. For the moment he did
    not notice how he had been trapped into speaking of himself,
    nor did he see the quiet content on Iris's face when she
    elicited the information that his chief foe was a man. A
    certain tremulous hesitancy in her manner when she next spoke
    might have warned him, but his hungry soul caught only the warm
    sympathy of her words, which fell like rain on parched
    soil.</p>

    <p>"You are tired," she said. "Won't you smoke for a little
    while, and talk to me?"</p>

    <p>He produced his pipe and tobacco, but he used his right hand
    awkwardly. It was evident to her alert eyes that the torn quick
    on his injured finger was hurting him a great deal. The
    exciting events of the morning had caused him temporarily to
    forget his wound, and the rapid coursing of the blood through
    the veins was now causing him agonized throbs.</p>

    <p>With a cry of distress she sprang to her feet and insisted
    upon washing the wound. Then she tenderly dressed it with a
    strip of linen well soaked in brandy, thinking the while, with
    a sudden rush of color to her face, that although he could
    suggest this remedy for her slight hurt, he gave no thought to
    his own serious injury. Finally she pounced upon his pipe and
    tobacco-box.</p>

    <p>"Don't be alarmed," she laughed. "I have often filled my
    father's pipe for him. First, you put the tobacco in loosely,
    taking care not to use any that is too finely powdered. Then
    you pack the remainder quite tightly. But I was nearly
    forgetting. I haven't blown, through the pipe to see if it is
    clean."</p>

    <p>She suited the action to the word, using much needless
    breath in the operation.</p>

    <p>"That is a first-rate pipe," she declared. "My father always
    said that a straight stem, with the bowl at a right angle, was
    the correct shape. You evidently agree with him."</p>

    <p>"Absolutely."</p>

    <p>"You will like my father when you meet him. He is the very
    best man alive, I am sure."</p>

    <p>"You two are great friends, then?"</p>

    <p>"Great friends! He is the only friend I possess in the
    world."</p>

    <p>"What! Is that quite accurate?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, quite. Of course, Mr. Jenks, I can never forget how
    much I owe to you. I like you immensely, too, although you are
    so&mdash;so gruff to me at times. But&mdash;but&mdash;you see,
    my father and I have always been together. I have neither
    brother nor sister, not even a cousin. My dear mother died from
    some horrid fever when I was quite a little girl. My father is
    everything to me."</p>

    <p>"Dear child!" he murmured, apparently uttering his thoughts
    aloud rather than addressing her directly. "So you find me
    gruff, eh?"</p>

    <p>"A regular bear, when you lecture me. But that is only
    occasionally. You can be very nice when you like, when you
    forget your past troubles. And pray, why do you call me a
    child?</p>

    <p>"Have I done so?"</p>

    <p>"Not a moment ago. How old are you, Mr. Jenks? I am
    twenty&mdash;twenty last December."</p>

    <p>"And I," he said, "will be twenty-eight in August."</p>

    <p>"Good gracious!" she gasped. "I am very sorry, but I really
    thought you were forty at least."</p>

    <p>"I look it, no doubt. Let me be equally candid and admit
    that you, too, show your age markedly."</p>

    <p>She smiled nervously. "What a lot of trouble you must have
    had to&mdash;to&mdash;to give you those little wrinkles in the
    corners of your mouth and eyes," she said.</p>

    <p>"Wrinkles! How terrible!"</p>

    <p>"I don't know. I think they rather suit you; besides, it was
    stupid of me to imagine you were so old. I suppose exposure to
    the sun creates wrinkles, and you must have lived much in the
    open air."</p>

    <p>"Early rising and late going to bed are bad for the
    complexion," he declared, solemnly.</p>

    <p>"I often wonder how army officers manage to exist," she
    said. "They never seem to get enough sleep, in the East, at any
    rate. I have seen them dancing for hours after midnight, and
    heard of them pig-sticking or schooling hunters at five o'clock
    next morning."</p>

    <p>"So you assume I have been in the army?"</p>

    <p>"I am quite sure of it."</p>

    <p>"May I ask why?"</p>

    <p>"Your manner, your voice, your quiet air of authority, the
    very way you walk, all betray you."</p>

    <p>"Then," he said sadly, "I will not attempt to deny the fact.
    I held a commission in the Indian Staff Corps for nine years.
    It was a hobby of mine, Miss Deane, to make myself acquainted
    with the best means of victualing my men and keeping them in
    good health under all sorts of fanciful conditions and in every
    kind of climate, especially under circumstances when ordinary
    stores were not available. With that object in view I read up
    every possible country in which my regiment might be engaged,
    learnt the local names of common articles of food, and
    ascertained particularly what provision nature made to sustain
    life. The study interested me. Once, during the Soudan
    campaign, it was really useful, and procured me promotion."</p>

    <p>"Tell me about it."</p>

    <p>"During some operations in the desert it was necessary for
    my troop to follow up a small party of rebels mounted on
    camels, which, as you probably know, can go without water much
    longer than horses. We were almost within striking distance,
    when our horses completely gave out, but I luckily noticed
    indications which showed that there was water beneath a portion
    of the plain much below the general level. Half an hour's spade
    work proved that I was right. We took up the pursuit again, and
    ran the quarry to earth, and I got my captaincy."</p>

    <p>"Was there no fight?"</p>

    <p>He paused an appreciable time before replying. Then he
    evidently made up his mind to perform some disagreeable task.
    The watching girl could see the change in his face, the sharp
    transition from eager interest to angry resentment.</p>

    <p>"Yes," he went on at last, "there was a fight. It was a
    rather stiff affair, because a troop of British cavalry which
    should have supported me had turned back, owing to the want of
    water already mentioned. But that did not save the officer in
    charge of the 24th Lancers from being severely
    reprimanded."</p>

    <p>"The 24th Lancers!" cried Iris. "Lord Ventnor's
    regiment!"</p>

    <p>"Lord Ventnor was the officer in question."</p>

    <p>Her face crimonsed. "Then you know him?" she said.</p>

    <p>"I do."</p>

    <p>"Is he your enemy?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"And that is why you were so agitated that last day on the
    <i>Sirdar</i>, when poor Lady Tozer asked me if I were engaged
    to him?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"How could it affect you? You did not even know my name
    then?"</p>

    <p>Poor Iris! She did not stop to ask herself why she framed
    her question in such manner, but the sailor was now too
    profoundly moved to heed the slip. She could not tell how he
    was fighting with himself, fiercely beating down the inner
    barriers of self-love, sternly determined, once and for all, to
    reveal himself in such light to this beautiful and bewitching
    woman that in future she would learn to regard him only as an
    outcast whose company she must perforce tolerate until relief
    came.</p>

    <p>"It affected me because the sudden mention of his name
    recalled my own disgrace. I quitted the army six months ago,
    Miss Deane, under very painful circumstances. A general
    court-martial found me guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer
    and a gentleman. I was not even given a chance to resign. I was
    cashiered."</p>

    <p>He pretended to speak with cool truculence. He thought to
    compel her into shrinking contempt. Yet his face blanched
    somewhat, and though he steadily kept the pipe between his
    teeth, and smoked with studied unconcern, his lips twitched a
    little.</p>

    <p>And he dared not look at her, for the girl's wondering eyes
    were fixed upon him, and the blush had disappeared as quickly
    as it came.</p>

    <p>"I remember something of this," she said slowly, never once
    averting her gaze. "There was some gossip concerning it when I
    first came to Hong Kong. You are Captain Robert
    Anstruther?"</p>

    <p>"I am."</p>

    <p>"And you publicly thrashed Lord Ventnor as the result of a
    quarrel about a woman?"</p>

    <p>"Your recollection is quite accurate."</p>

    <p>"Who was to blame?"</p>

    <p>"The lady said that I was."</p>

    <p>"Was it true?"</p>

    <p>Robert Anstruther, late captain of Bengal Cavalry, rose to
    his feet. He preferred to take his punishment standing.</p>

    <p>"The court-martial agreed with her, Miss Deane, and I am a
    prejudiced witness," he replied.</p>

    <p>"Who was the&mdash;lady?"</p>

    <p>"The wife of my colonel, Mrs. Costobell."</p>

    <p>"Oh!"</p>

    <p>Long afterwards he remembered the agony of that moment, and
    winced even at the remembrance. But he had decided upon a fixed
    policy, and he was not a man to flinch from consequences. Miss
    Deane must be taught to despise him, else, God help them both,
    she might learn to love him as he now loved her. So, blundering
    towards his goal as men always blunder where a woman's heart is
    concerned, he blindly persisted in allowing her to make such
    false deductions as she chose from his words.</p>

    <p>Iris was the first to regain some measure of
    self-control.</p>

    <p>"I am glad you have been so candid, Captain Anstruther," she
    commenced, but he broke in abruptly&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Jenks, if you please, Miss Deane. Robert Jenks."</p>

    <p>There was a curious light in her eyes, but he did not see
    it, and her voice was marvelously subdued as she
    continued&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Certainly, Mr. Jenks. Let me be equally explicit before we
    quit the subject. I have met Mrs. Costobell. I do not like her.
    I consider her a deceitful woman. Your court-martial might have
    found a different verdict had its members been of her sex. As
    for Lord Ventnor, he is nothing to me. It is true he asked my
    father to be permitted to pay his addresses to me, but my dear
    old dad left the matter wholly to my decision, and I certainly
    never gave Lord Ventnor any encouragement. I believe now that
    Mrs. Costobell lied, and that Lord Ventnor lied, when they
    attributed any dishonorable action to you, and I am glad that
    you beat him in the Club. I am quite sure he deserved it."</p>

    <p>Not one word did this strange man vouchsafe in reply. He
    started violently, seized the axe lying at his feet, and went
    straight among the trees, keeping his face turned from Iris so
    that she might not see the tears in his eyes.</p>

    <p>As for the girl, she began to scour her cooking utensils
    with much energy, and soon commenced a song. Considering that
    she was compelled to constantly endure the company of a
    degraded officer, who had been expelled from the service with
    ignominy, she was absurdly contented. Indeed, with the happy
    inconsequence of youth, she quickly threw all care to the
    winds, and devoted her thoughts to planning a surprise for the
    next day by preparing some tea, provided she could
    surreptitiously open the chest.</p>
    <hr>
    <a name="CHAPTER_VII"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

    <h2>SURPRISES</h2>

    <p>Before night closed their third day on the island Jenks
    managed to construct a roomy tent-house, with a framework of
    sturdy trees selected on account of their location. To these he
    nailed or tied crossbeams of felled saplings; and the
    tarpaulins dragged from the beach supplied roof and walls. It
    required the united strength of Iris and himself to haul into
    position the heavy sheet that topped the structure, whilst he
    was compelled to desist from active building operations in
    order to fashion a rough ladder. Without some such contrivance
    he could not get the topmost supports adjusted at a sufficient
    height.</p>

    <p>Although the edifice required at least two more days of hard
    work before it would be fit for habitation Iris wished to take
    up her quarters there immediately. This the sailor would not
    hear of.</p>

    <p>"In the cave," he said, "you are absolutely sheltered from
    all the winds that blow or rain that falls. Our villa, however,
    is painfully leaky and draughty at present. When asleep, the
    whole body is relaxed, and you are then most open to the
    attacks of cold or fever, in which case, Miss Deane, I shall be
    reluctantly obliged to dose you with a concoction of that tree
    there."</p>

    <p>He pointed to a neighboring cinchona, and Iris naturally
    asked why he selected that particular brand.</p>

    <p>"Because it is quinine, not made up in nice little tabloids,
    but <i>au naturel</i>. It will not be a bad plan if we prepare
    a strong infusion, and take a small quantity every morning on
    the excellent principle that prevention is better than
    cure."</p>

    <p>The girl laughed.</p>

    <p>"Good gracious!" she said; "that reminds me&mdash;"</p>

    <p>But the words died away on her lips in sudden fright. They
    were standing on the level plateau in front of the cave, well
    removed from the trees, and they could see distinctly on all
    sides, for the sun was sinking in a cloudless sky and the air
    was preternaturally clear, being free now from the tremulous
    haze of the hot hours.</p>

    <p>Across the smooth expanse of sandy ground came the agonized
    shrieks of a startled bird&mdash;a large bird, it would
    seem&mdash;winging its way towards them with incredible
    swiftness, and uttering a succession of loud full-voiced notes
    of alarm.</p>

    <p>Yet the strange thing was that not a bird was to be seen. At
    that hour the ordinary feathered inhabitants of the island were
    quietly nestling among the branches preparatory to making a
    final selection of the night's resting-place. None of them
    would stir unless actually disturbed.</p>

    <p>Iris drew near to the sailor. Involuntarily she caught his
    arm. He stepped a half-pace in front of her to ward off any
    danger that might be heralded by this new and uncanny
    phenomenon. Together they strained their eyes in the direction
    of the approaching sound, but apparently their sight was
    bewitched; as nothing whatever was visible.</p>

    <p>"Oh, what is it?" wailed Iris, who now clung to Jenks in a
    state of great apprehension.</p>

    <p>The clucking noise came nearer, passed them within a yard,
    and was already some distance away towards the reef when the
    sailor burst into a hearty laugh, none the less genuine because
    of the relief it gave to his bewildered senses.</p>

    <p>Reassured, but still white with fear, Iris cried: "Do speak,
    please, Mr. Jenks. What was it?"</p>

    <p>"A beetle!" he managed to gasp.</p>

    <p>"A beetle?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, a small, insignificant-looking fellow, too&mdash;so
    small that I did not see him until he was almost out of range.
    He has the loudest voice for his size in the whole of creation.
    A man able to shout on the same scale could easily make himself
    heard for twenty miles."</p>

    <p>"Then I do not like such beetles; I always hated them, but
    this latest variety is positively detestable. Such nasty things
    ought to be kept in zoological gardens, and not turned loose.
    Moreover, my tea will be boiled into spinach."</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, the tea, though minus sugar or milk, was
    grateful enough and particularly acceptable to the sailor, who
    entertained Iris with a disquisition on the many virtues of
    that marvelous beverage. Curiously enough, the lifting of the
    veil upon the man's earlier history made these two much better
    friends. With more complete acquaintance there was far less
    tendency towards certain passages which, under ordinary
    conditions, could be construed as nothing else than downright
    flirtation.</p>

    <p>They made the pleasing discovery that they could both sing.
    There was hardly an opera in vogue that one or other did not
    know sufficiently well to be able to recall the chief musical
    numbers. Iris had a sweet and sympathetic mezzo-soprano voice,
    Jenks an excellent baritone, and, to the secret amazement of
    the girl, he rendered one or two well-known Anglo-Indian
    barrack-room ditties with much humor.</p>

    <p>This, then, was the <i>mise-en-sc&eacute;ne</i>.</p>

    <p>Iris, seated in the broken saloon-chair, which the sailor
    had firmly wedged into the sand for her accommodation, was
    attired in a close-fitting costume selected from the small
    store of garments so wisely preserved by Jenks. She wore a pair
    of clumsy men's boots several sizes too large for her. Her hair
    was tied up in a gipsy knot on the back of her head, and the
    light of a cheerful log fire danced in her blue eyes.</p>

    <p>Jenks, unshaven and ragged, squatted tailor wise near her.
    Close at hand, on two sides, the shaggy walls of rock rose in
    solemn grandeur. The neighboring trees, decked now in the sable
    livery of night, were dimly outlined against the deep misty
    blue of sea and sky or wholly merged in the shadow of the
    cliffs.</p>

    <p>They lost themselves in the peaceful influences of the hour.
    Shipwrecked, remote from human land, environed by dangers known
    or only conjectured, two solitary beings on a tiny island,
    thrown haphazard from the depths of the China Sea, this young
    couple, after passing unscathed through perils unknown even to
    the writers of melodrama, lifted up their voices in the sheer
    exuberance of good spirits and abounding vitality.</p>

    <p>The girl was specially attracted by "The Buffalo Battery," a
    rollicking lyric known to all Anglo-India from Peshawur to
    Tuticorin. The air is the familiar one of the "Hen Convention,"
    and the opening verse runs in this wise:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I love to hear the sepoy with his bold and martial
            tread,</p>

            <p>And the thud of the galloping cavalry re-echoes
            through my head.</p>

            <p>But sweeter far than any sound by mortal ever
            made</p>

            <p>Is the tramp of the Buffalo Battery a-going to
            parade.</p>

            <p class="i2"><i>Chorus</i>: &nbsp;&nbsp; For it's
            "Hainya! hainya! hainya! hainya!"</p>

            <p class="i12">Twist their tails and go.</p>

            <p class="i10">With a "H&acirc;thi! h&acirc;thi!
            h&acirc;thi!" ele-<i>phant</i> and buffa<i>lo</i>,</p>

            <p class="i10">"Chow-chow, chow-chow, chow-chow,
            chow-chow,"</p>

            <p class="i12">"T&egrave;ri ma!" "Chel-lo!"</p>

            <p class="i10">Oh, that's the way they shout all day,
            and drive the buffalo.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Iris would not be satisfied until she understood the meaning
    of the Hindustani phrases, mastered the nasal pronunciation of
    "hainya," and placed the artificial accent on <i>phant</i> and
    <i>lo</i> in the second line of the chorus.</p>

    <p>Jenks was concluding the last verse when there came,
    hurtling through the air, the weird cries of the singing
    beetle, returning, perchance, from successful foray on
    Palm-tree Rock. This second advent of the insect put an end to
    the concert. Within a quarter of an hour they were asleep.</p>

    <p>Thenceforth, for ten days, they labored unceasingly,
    starting work at daybreak and stopping only when the light
    failed, finding the long hours of sunshine all too short for
    the manifold tasks demanded of them, yet thankful that the
    night brought rest. The sailor made out a programme to which he
    rigidly adhered. In the first place, he completed the house,
    which had two compartments, an inner room in which Iris slept,
    and an outer, which served as a shelter for their meals and
    provided a bedroom for the man.</p>

    <p>Then he constructed a gigantic sky-sign on Summit Rock, the
    small cluster of boulders on top of the cliff. His chief
    difficulty was to hoist into place the tall poles he needed,
    and for this purpose he had to again visit Palm-tree Rock in
    order to secure the pulley. By exercising much ingenuity in
    devising shear-legs, he at last succeeded in lifting the masts
    into their allotted receptacles, where they were firmly
    secured. Finally he was able to swing into air, high above the
    tops of the neighboring trees, the loftiest of which he felled
    in order to clear the view on all sides, the name of the ship
    <i>Sirdar</i>, fashioned in six-foot letters nailed and spliced
    together in sections and made from the timbers of that
    ill-fated vessel.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile he taught Iris how to weave a net out of the
    strands of unraveled cordage. With this, weighted by bullets,
    he contrived a casting-net and caught a lot of small fish in
    the lagoon. At first they were unable to decide which varieties
    were edible, until a happy expedient occurred to the girl.</p>

    <p>"The seabirds can tell us," she said. "Let us spread out our
    haul on the sands and leave them. By observing those specimens
    seized by the birds and those they reject we should not go far
    wrong."</p>

    <p>Though her reasoning was not infallible it certainly proved
    to be a reliable guide in this instance. Among the fish
    selected by the feathered connoisseurs they hit upon two
    species which most resembled whiting and haddock, and these
    turned out to be very palatable and wholesome.</p>

    <p>Jenks knew a good deal of botany, and enough about birds to
    differentiate between carnivorous species and those fit for
    human food, whilst the salt in their most fortunate supply of
    hams rendered their meals almost epicurean. Think of it, ye
    dwellers in cities, content with stale buns and leathery
    sandwiches when ye venture into the wilds of a railway
    refreshment-room, these two castaways, marooned by queer chance
    on a desert island, could sit down daily to a banquet of
    vegetable soup, fish, a roast bird, ham boiled or fried, and a
    sago pudding, the whole washed down by cool spring water, or,
    should the need arise, a draught of the best champagne!</p>

    <p>From the rusty rifles on the reef Jenks brought away the
    bayonets and secured all the screws, bolts, and other small
    odds and ends which might be serviceable. From the barrels he
    built a handy grate to facilitate Iris's cooking operations,
    and a careful search each morning amidst the ashes of any burnt
    wreckage accumulated a store of most useful nails.</p>

    <p>The pressing need for a safe yet accessible bathing place
    led him and the girl to devote one afternoon to a complete
    survey of the coast-line. By this time they had given names to
    all the chief localities. The northerly promontory was
    naturally christened North Cape; the western, Europa Point; the
    portion of the reef between their habitation and Palm-tree Rock
    became Filey Brig; the other section North-west Reef. The flat
    sandy passage across the island, containing the cave, house,
    and well, was named Prospect Park; and the extensive stretch of
    sand on the south-east, with its guard of broken reefs, was at
    once dubbed Turtle Beach when Jenks discovered that an immense
    number of green turtles were paying their spring visit to the
    island to bury their eggs in the sand.</p>

    <p>The two began their tour of inspection by passing the scene
    of the first desperate struggle to escape from the clutch of
    the typhoon. Iris would not be content until the sailor showed
    her the rock behind which he placed her for shelter whilst he
    searched for water. For a moment the recollection of their
    unfortunate companions on board ship brought a lump into her
    throat and dimmed her eyes.</p>

    <p>"I remember them in my prayers every night," she confided to
    him. "It seems so unutterably sad that they should be lost,
    whilst we are alive and happy."</p>

    <p>The man distracted her attention by pointing out the embers
    of their first fire. It was the only way to choke back the
    tumultuous feelings that suddenly stormed his heart. Happy!
    Yes, he had never before known such happiness. How long would
    it last? High up on the cliff swung the signal to anxious
    searchers of the sea that here would be found the survivors of
    the <i>Sirdar</i>. And then, when rescue came, when Miss Deane
    became once more the daughter of a wealthy baronet, and he a
    disgraced and a nameless outcast&mdash;! He set his teeth and
    savagely struck at a full cup of the pitcher-plant which had so
    providentially relieved their killing thirst.</p>

    <p>"Oh, why did you do that?" pouted Iris. "Poor thing! it was
    a true friend in need. I wish I could do something for it to
    make it the best and leafiest plant of its kind on the
    island."</p>

    <p>"Very well!" he answered; "you can gratify your wish. A
    tinful of fresh water from the well, applied daily to its
    roots, will quickly achieve that end."</p>

    <p>The moroseness of his tone and manner surprised her. For
    once her quick intuition failed to divine the source of his
    irritation.</p>

    <p>"You give your advice ungraciously," she said, "but I will
    adopt it nevertheless."</p>

    <p>A harmless incident, a kindly and quite feminine resolve,
    yet big with fate for both of them.</p>

    <p>Jenks's unwonted ill-humor&mdash;for the passage of days had
    driven from his face all its harshness, and from his tongue all
    its assumed bitterness&mdash;created a passing cloud until the
    physical exertion of scrambling over the rocks to round the
    North Cape restored their normal relations.</p>

    <p>A strong current raced by this point to the south-east, and
    tore away the outlying spur of the headland to such an extent
    that the sailor was almost inclined to choose the easier way
    through the trees. Yet he persevered, and it may be confessed
    that the opportunities thus afforded of grasping the girl's
    arm, of placing a steadying hand on her shoulder, were dominant
    factors in determining his choice.</p>

    <p>At last they reached the south side, and here they at once
    found themselves in a delightfully secluded and tiny bay,
    sandy, tree-lined, sheltered on three sides by cliffs and
    rocks.</p>

    <p>"Oh," cried Iris, excitedly, "what a lovely spot! a perfect
    Smugglers' Cove."</p>

    <p>"Charming enough to look at," was the answering comment,
    "but open to the sea. If you look at the smooth riband of water
    out there, you will perceive a passage through the reef. A
    great place for sharks, Miss Deane, but no place for
    bathers."</p>

    <p>"Good gracious! I had forgotten the sharks. I suppose they
    must live, horrid as they are, but I don't want them to dine on
    me."</p>

    <p>The mention of such disagreeable adjuncts to life on the
    island no longer terrified her. Thus do English newcomers to
    India pass the first three months' residence in the country in
    momentary terror of snakes, and the remaining thirty years in
    complete forgetfulness of them.</p>

    <p>They passed on. Whilst traversing the coral-strewn south
    beach, with its patches of white soft sand baking in the direct
    rays of the sun, Jenks perceived traces of the turtle which
    swarmed in the neighboring sea.</p>

    <p>"Delicious eggs and turtle soup!" he announced when Iris
    asked him why he was so intently studying certain marks on the
    sand, caused by the great sea-tortoise during their nocturnal
    visits to the breeding-ground.</p>

    <p>"If they are green turtle," he continued, "we are in the lap
    of luxury. They lard the alderman and inspire the poet. When a
    ship comes to our assistance I will persuade the captain to
    freight the vessel with them and make my fortune."</p>

    <p>"I suppose, under the circumstances, you were not a rich
    man, Mr. Jenks," said Iris, timidly.</p>

    <p>"I possess a wealthy bachelor uncle, who made me his heir
    and allowed me four hundred a year; so I was a sort of Croesus
    among Staff Corps officers. When the smash came he disowned me
    by cable. By selling my ponies and my other belongings I was
    able to walk out of my quarters penniless but free from
    debt."</p>

    <p>"And all through a deceitful woman!"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Iris peeped at him from under the brim of her sou'wester. He
    seemed to be absurdly contented, so different was his tone in
    discussing a necessarily painful topic to the attitude he
    adopted during the attack on the pitcher-plant.</p>

    <p>She was puzzled, but ventured a further step.</p>

    <p>"Was she very bad to you, Mr. Jenks?"</p>

    <p>He stopped and laughed&mdash;actually roared at the
    suggestion.</p>

    <p>"Bad to me!" he repeated. "I had nothing to do with her. She
    was humbugging her husband, not me. Fool that I was, I could
    not mind my own business."</p>

    <p>So Mrs. Costobell was not flirting with the man who suffered
    on her account. It is a regrettable but true statement that
    Iris would willingly have hugged Mrs. Costobell at that moment.
    She walked on air during the next half-hour of golden silence,
    and Jenks did not remind her that they were passing the
    gruesome Valley of Death.</p>

    <p>Rounding Europa Point, the sailor's eyes were fixed on their
    immediate surroundings, but Iris gazed dreamily ahead. Hence it
    was that she was the first to cry in amazement&mdash;</p>

    <p>"A boat! See, there! On the rocks!"</p>

    <p>There was no mistake. A ship's boat was perched high and dry
    on the north side of the cape. Even as they scrambled towards
    it Jenks understood how it had come there.</p>

    <p>When the <i>Sirdar</i> parted amidships the after section
    fell back into the depths beyond the reef, and this boat must
    have broken loose from its davits and been driven ashore here
    by the force of the western current.</p>

    <p>Was it intact? Could they escape? Was this ark stranded on
    the island for their benefit? If it were seaworthy, whither
    should they steer&mdash;to those islands whose blue outlines
    were visible on the horizon?</p>

    <p>These and a hundred other questions coursed through his
    brain during the race over the rocks, but all such wild
    speculations were promptly settled when they reached the craft,
    for the keel and the whole of the lower timbers were smashed
    into matchwood.</p>

    <p>But there were stores on board. Jenks remembered that
    Captain Ross's foresight had secured the provisioning of all
    the ship's boats soon after the first wild rush to steady the
    vessel after the propeller was lost. Masts, sails, oars,
    seats&mdash;all save two water-casks&mdash;had gone; but Jenks,
    with eager hands, unfastened the lockers, and here he found a
    good supply of tinned meats and biscuits. They had barely
    recovered from the excitement of this find when the sailor
    noticed that behind the rocks on which the craft was firmly
    lodged lay a small natural basin full of salt water,
    replenished and freshened by the spray of every gale, and
    completely shut off from all seaward access.</p>

    <p>It was not more than four feet deep, beautifully carpeted
    with sand, and secluded by rocks on all sides. Not the tiniest
    crab or fish was to be seen. It provided an ideal bath.</p>

    <p>Iris was overjoyed. She pointed towards their
    habitation.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Jenks," she said, "I will be with you at tea-time."</p>

    <p>He gathered all the tins he was able to carry and strode
    off, enjoining her to fire her revolver if for the slightest
    reason she wanted assistance, and giving a parting warning that
    if she delayed too long he would come and shout to her.</p>

    <p>"I wonder," said the girl to herself, watching his
    retreating figure, "what he is afraid of. Surely by this time
    we have exhausted the unpleasant surprises of the island.
    Anyhow, now for a splash!"</p>

    <p>She was hardly in the water before she began to be afraid on
    account of Jenks. Suppose anything happened to him whilst she
    was thoughtlessly enjoying herself here. So strongly did the
    thought possess her that she hurriedly dressed again and ran
    off to find him.</p>

    <p>He was engaged in fastening a number of bayonets
    transversely to a long piece of timber.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing that for?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"Why did you return so soon? Did anything alarm you?"</p>

    <p>"I thought you might get into mischief," she confessed.</p>

    <p>"No. On the other hand, I am trying to make trouble for any
    unwelcome visitors," he replied. "This is a <i>cheval de
    frise</i>, which I intend to set up in front of our cave in
    case we are compelled to defend ourselves against an attack by
    savages. With this barring the way they cannot rush the
    position."</p>

    <p>She sighed. Rainbow Island was a wild spot after all. Did
    not thorns and briers grow very close to the gates of Eden?</p>

    <p>On the nineteenth day of their residence on the island the
    sailor climbed, as was his invariable habit, to the Summit Rock
    whilst Iris prepared breakfast. At this early hour the horizon
    was clearly cut as the rim of a sapphire. He examined the whole
    arc of the sea with his glasses, but not a sail was in sight.
    According to his calculations, the growing anxiety as to the
    fate of the <i>Sirdar</i> must long ere this have culminated in
    the dispatch from Hong Kong or Singapore of a special search
    vessel, whilst British warships in the China Sea would be
    warned to keep a close lookout for any traces of the steamer,
    to visit all islands on their route, and to question fishermen
    whom they encountered. So help might come any day, or it might
    be long deferred. He could not pierce the future, and it was
    useless to vex his soul with questionings as to what might
    happen next week. The great certainty of the hour was
    Iris&mdash;the blue-eyed, smiling divinity who had come into
    his life&mdash;waiting for him down there beyond the trees,
    waiting to welcome him with a sweet-voiced greeting; and he
    knew, with a fierce devouring joy, that her cheek would not
    pale nor her lip tremble when he announced that at least
    another sun must set before the expected relief reached
    them.</p>

    <p>He replaced the glasses in their case and dived into the
    wood, giving a passing thought to the fact that the wind, after
    blowing steadily from the south for nearly a week, had veered
    round to the north-east during the night. Did the change
    portend a storm? Well, they were now prepared for all such
    eventualities, and he had not forgotten that they possessed,
    among other treasures, a box of books for rainy days. And a
    rainy day with Iris for company! What gale that ever blew could
    offer such compensation for enforced idleness?</p>

    <p>The morning sped in uneventful work. Iris did not neglect
    her cherished pitcher-plant. After luncheon it was her custom
    now to carry a dishful of water to its apparently arid roots,
    and she rose to fulfil her self-imposed task.</p>

    <p>"Let me help you," said Jenks. "I am not very busy this
    afternoon."</p>

    <p>"No, thank you. I simply won't allow you to touch that
    shrub. The dear thing looks quite glad to see me. It drinks up
    the water as greedily as a thirsty animal."</p>

    <p>"Even a cabbage has a heart, Miss Deane."</p>

    <p>She laughed merrily. "I do believe you are offering me a
    compliment," she said. "I must indeed have found favor in your
    eyes."</p>

    <p>He had schooled himself to resist the opening given by this
    class of retort, so he turned to make some corrections in the
    scale of the sun-dial he had constructed, aided therein by
    daily observations with the sextant left by the former
    inhabitant of the cave.</p>

    <p>Iris had been gone perhaps five minutes when he heard a
    distant shriek, twice repeated, and then there came faintly to
    his ears his own name, not "Jenks," but "Robert," in the girl's
    voice. Something terrible had happened. It was a cry of supreme
    distress. Mortal agony or overwhelming terror alone could wring
    that name from her lips. Precisely in such moments this man
    acted with the decision, the unerring judgment, the
    instantaneous acceptance of great risk to accomplish great
    results, that marked him out as a born soldier.</p>

    <p>He rushed into the house and snatched from the rifle-rack
    one of the six Lee-Metfords reposing there in apple-pie order,
    each with a filled magazine attached and a cartridge already in
    position.</p>

    <p>Then he ran, with long swift strides, not through the trees,
    where he could see nothing, but towards the beach, whence, in
    forty yards, the place where Iris probably was would become
    visible.</p>

    <p>At once he saw her, struggling in the grasp of two
    ferocious-looking Dyaks, one, by his garments, a person of
    consequence, the other a half-naked savage, hideous and
    repulsive in appearance. Around them seven men, armed with guns
    and parangs, were dancing with excitement.</p>

    <p>Iris's captors were endeavoring to tie her arms, but she was
    a strong and active Englishwoman, with muscles well knit by the
    constant labor of recent busy days and a frame developed by
    years of horse-riding and tennis-playing. The pair evidently
    found her a tough handful, and the inferior Dyak, either to
    stop her screams&mdash;for she was shrieking "Robert, come to
    me!" with all her might&mdash;or to stifle her into submission,
    roughly placed his huge hand over her mouth.</p>

    <p>These things the sailor noticed instantly. Some men, brave
    to rashness, ready as he to give his life to save her, would
    have raced madly over the intervening ground, scarce a furlong,
    and attempted a heroic combat of one against nine.</p>

    <p>Not so Jenks.</p>

    <p>With the methodical exactness of the parade-ground he
    settled down on one knee and leveled the rifle. At that range
    the Lee-Metford bullet travels practically point-blank. Usually
    it is deficient in "stopping" power, but he had provided
    against this little drawback by notching all the cartridges in
    the six rifles after the effective manner devised by an expert
    named Thomas Atkins during the Tirah campaign.</p>

    <p>None of the Dyaks saw him. All were intent on the
    sensational prize they had secured, a young and beautiful white
    woman so contentedly roaming about the shores of this Fetish
    island. With the slow speed advised by the Roman philosopher,
    the backsight and foresight of the Lee-Metford came into line
    with the breast of the coarse brute clutching the girl's
    face.</p>

    <p>Then something bit him above the heart and simultaneously
    tore half of his back into fragments. He fell, with a queer
    sob, and the others turned to face this unexpected danger.</p>

    <p>Iris, knowing only that she was free from that hateful
    grasp, wrenched herself free from the chief's hold, and ran
    with all her might along the beach, to Jenks and safety.</p>

    <p>Again, and yet again, the rifle gave its short, sharp snarl,
    and two more Dyaks collapsed on the sand. Six were left, their
    leader being still unconsciously preserved from death by the
    figure of the flying girl.</p>

    <p>A fourth Dyak dropped.</p>

    <p>The survivors, cruel savages but not cowards, unslung their
    guns. The sailor, white-faced, grim, with an unpleasant gleam
    in his deep-set eyes and a lower jaw protruding, noticed their
    preparations.</p>

    <p>"To the left!" he shouted. "Run towards the trees!"</p>

    <p>Iris heard him and strove to obey. But her strength was
    failing her, and she staggered blindly. After a few despairing
    efforts she lurched feebly to her knees, and tumbled face
    downwards on the broken coral that had tripped her faltering
    footsteps.</p>

    <p>Jenks was watching her, watching the remaining Dyaks, from
    whom a spluttering volley came, picking out his quarry with the
    murderous ease of a terrier in a rat-pit. Something like a bee
    in a violent hurry hummed past his ear, and a rock near his
    right foot was struck a tremendous blow by an unseen agency. He
    liked this. It would be a battle, not a battue.</p>

    <p>The fifth Dyak crumpled into the distortion of death, and
    then their leader took deliberate aim at the kneeling marksman
    who threatened to wipe him and his band out of existence. But
    his deliberation, though skilful, was too profound. The sailor
    fired first, and was professionally astonished to see the
    gaudily attired individual tossed violently backward for many
    yards, finally pitching headlong to the earth. Had he been
    charged by a bull in full career he could not have been more
    utterly discomfited. The incident was sensational but
    inexplicable.</p>

    <p>Yet another member of the band was prostrated ere the two as
    yet unscathed thought fit to beat a retreat. This they now did
    with celerity, but they dragged their chief with them. It was
    no part of Jenks's programme to allow them to escape. He aimed
    again at the man nearest the trees. There was a sharp click and
    nothing more. The cartridge was a mis-fire. He hastily sought
    to eject it, and the rifle jammed. These little accidents will
    happen, even in a good weapon like the Lee-Metford.</p>

    <p>Springing to his feet with a yell he ran forward. The flying
    men caught a glimpse of him and accelerated their movements.
    Just as he reached Iris they vanished among the trees.</p>

    <p>Slinging the rifle over his shoulder, he picked up the girl
    in his arms. She was conscious, but breathless.</p>

    <p>"You are not hurt?" he gasped, his eyes blazing into her
    face with an intensity that she afterwards remembered as
    appalling.</p>

    <p>"No," she whispered.</p>

    <p>"Listen," he continued in labored jerks. "Try and obey
    me&mdash;exactly. I will carry you&mdash;to the cave. Stop
    there. Shoot any one you see&mdash;till I come."</p>

    <p>She heard him wonderingly. Was he going to leave her, now
    that he had her safely clasped to his breast? Impossible! Ah,
    she understood. Those men must have landed in a boat. He
    intended to attack them again. He was going to fight them
    single-handed, and she would not know what happened to him
    until it was all over. Gradually her vitality returned. She
    almost smiled at the fantastic conceit that <i>she</i> would
    desert <i>him</i>.</p>

    <p>Jenks placed her on her feet at the entrance to the
    cave.</p>

    <p>"You understand," he cried, and without waiting for an
    answer, ran to the house for another rifle. This time, to her
    amazement, he darted back through Prospect Park towards the
    south beach. The sailor knew that the Dyaks had landed at the
    sandy bay Iris had christened Smugglers' Cove. They were
    acquainted with the passage through the reef and came from the
    distant islands. Now they would endeavor to escape by the same
    channel. They must be prevented at all costs.</p>

    <p>He was right. As they came out into the open he saw three
    men, not two, pushing off a large sampan. One of them,
    <i>mirabile dictu</i>, was the chief. Then Jenks understood
    that his bullet had hit the lock of the Dyak's uplifted weapon,
    with the result already described. By a miracle he had
    escaped.</p>

    <p>He coolly prepared to slay the three of them with the same
    calm purpose that distinguished the opening phase of this
    singularly one-sided conflict. The distance was much greater,
    perhaps 800 yards from the point where the boat came into view.
    He knelt and fired. He judged that the missile struck the craft
    between the trio.</p>

    <p>"I didn't allow for the sun on the side of the foresight,"
    he said. "Or perhaps I am a bit shaky after the run. In any
    event they can't go far."</p>

    <p>A hurrying step on the coral behind him caught his ear.
    Instantly he sprang up and faced about&mdash;to see Iris.</p>

    <p>"They are escaping," she said.</p>

    <p>"No fear of that," he replied, turning away from her.</p>

    <p>"Where are the others?"</p>

    <p>"Dead!"</p>

    <p>"Do you mean that you killed nearly all those men?"</p>

    <p>"Six of them. There were nine in all."</p>

    <p>He knelt again, lifting the rifle. Iris threw herself on her
    knees by his side. There was something awful to her in this
    chill and business-like declaration of a fixed purpose.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Jenks," she said, clasping her hands in an agony of
    entreaty, "do not kill more men for my sake!"</p>

    <p>"For my own sake, then," he growled, annoyed at the
    interruption, as the sampan was afloat.</p>

    <p>"Then I ask you for God's sake not to take another life.
    What you have already done was unavoidable, perhaps right. This
    is murder!"</p>

    <p>He lowered his weapon and looked at her.</p>

    <p>"If those men get away they will bring back a host to avenge
    their comrades&mdash;and secure you," he added.</p>

    <p>"It may be the will of Providence for such a thing to
    happen. Yet I implore you to spare them."</p>

    <p>He placed the rifle on the sand and raised her tenderly, for
    she had yielded to a paroxysm of tears. Not another word did
    either of them speak in that hour. The large triangular sail of
    the sampan was now bellying out in the south wind. A figure
    stood up in the stern of the boat and shook a menacing arm at
    the couple on the beach.</p>

    <p>It was the Malay chief, cursing them with the rude eloquence
    of his barbarous tongue. And Jenks well knew what he was
    saying.</p>
    <hr>
    <a name="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

    <h2>PREPARATIONS</h2>

    <p>They looked long and steadfastly at the retreating boat.
    Soon it diminished to a mere speck on the smooth sea. The even
    breeze kept its canvas taut, and the sailor knew that no ruse
    was intended&mdash;the Dyaks were flying from the island in
    fear and rage. They would return with a force sufficient to
    insure the wreaking of their vengeance.</p>

    <p>That he would again encounter them at no distant date Jenks
    had no doubt whatever. They would land in such numbers as to
    render any resistance difficult and a prolonged defence
    impossible. Would help come first?&mdash;a distracting question
    to which definite answer could not be given. The sailor's brow
    frowned in deep lines; his brain throbbed now with an anxiety
    singularly at variance with his cool demeanor during the fight.
    He was utterly unconscious that his left arm encircled the
    shoulder of the girl until she gently disengaged herself and
    said appealingly&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Please, Mr. Jenks, do not be angry with me. I could not
    help it. I could not bear to see you shoot them."</p>

    <p>Then he abruptly awoke to the realities of the moment.</p>

    <p>"Come." he said, his drawn features relaxing into a
    wonderfully pleasing smile. "We will return to our castle. We
    are safe for the remainder of this day, at any rate."</p>

    <p>Something must be said or done to reassure her. She was
    still grievously disturbed, and he naturally ascribed her
    agitation to the horror of her capture. He dreaded a complete
    collapse if any further alarms threatened at once. Yet he was
    almost positive&mdash;though search alone would set at rest the
    last misgiving&mdash;that only one sampan had visited the
    island. Evidently the Dyaks were unprepared as he for the
    events of the preceding half-hour. They were either visiting
    the island to procure turtle and <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> or
    had merely called there <i>en route</i> to some other
    destination, and the change in the wind had unexpectedly
    compelled them to put ashore. Beyond all doubt they must have
    been surprised by the warmth of the reception they
    encountered.</p>

    <p>Probably, when he went to Summit Rock that morning, the
    savages had lowered their sail and were steadily paddling north
    against wind and current. The most careful scrutiny of the sea
    would fail to reveal them beyond a distance of six or seven
    miles at the utmost.</p>

    <p>After landing in the hidden bay on the south side, they
    crossed the island through the trees instead of taking the more
    natural open way along the beach. Why? The fact that he and
    Iris were then passing the grown-over tract leading to the
    Valley of Death instantly determined this point. The Dyaks knew
    of this affrighting hollow, and would not approach any nearer
    to it than was unavoidable. Could he twist this circumstance to
    advantage if Iris and he were still stranded there when the
    superstitious sea-rovers next put in an appearance? He would
    see. All depended on the girl's strength. If she gave way
    now&mdash;if, instead of taking instant measures for safety, he
    were called upon to nurse her through a fever&mdash;the outlook
    became not only desperate but hopeless.</p>

    <p>And, whilst he bent his brows in worrying thought, the color
    was returning to Iris's cheeks, and natural buoyancy to her
    step. It is the fault of all men to underrate the marvelous
    courage and constancy of woman in the face of difficulties and
    trials. Jenks was no exception to the rule.</p>

    <p>"You do not ask me for any account of my adventures," she
    said quietly, after watching his perplexed expression in
    silence for some time.</p>

    <p>Her tone almost startled him, its unassumed cheerfulness was
    so unlooked for.</p>

    <p>"No," he answered. "I thought you were too overwrought to
    talk of them at present."</p>

    <p>"Overwrought! Not a bit of it! I was dead beat with the
    struggle and with screaming for you, but please don't imagine
    that I am going to faint or treat you to a display of hysteria
    now that all the excitement has ended. I admit that I cried a
    little when you pushed me aside on the beach and raised your
    gun to fire at those poor wretches flying for their lives. Yet
    perhaps I was wrong to hinder you."</p>

    <p>"You were wrong," he gravely interrupted.</p>

    <p>"Then you should not have heeded me. No, I don't mean that.
    You always consider me first, don't you? No matter what I ask
    you to do you endeavor to please me, even when you know all the
    time that I am acting or speaking foolishly."</p>

    <p>The unthinking <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of her words sent
    the blood coursing wildly through his veins.</p>

    <p>"Never mind," she went on with earnest simplicity. "God has
    been very good to us. I cannot believe that He has preserved us
    from so many dangers to permit us to perish miserably a few
    hours, or days, before help comes. And I <i>do</i> want to tell
    you exactly what happened."</p>

    <p>"Then you shall," he answered. "But first drink this." They
    had reached their camping-ground, and he hastened to procure a
    small quantity of brandy.</p>

    <p>She swallowed the spirit with a protesting <i>moue</i>. She
    really needed no such adventitious support, she said.</p>

    <p>"All right," commented Jenks. "If you don't want a drink, I
    do."</p>

    <p>"I can quite believe it," she retorted. "<i>Your</i> case is
    very different. <i>I</i> knew the men would not hurt
    me&mdash;after the first shock of their appearance had passed,
    I mean&mdash;I also knew that you would save me. But you, Mr.
    Jenks, had to do the fighting. You were called upon to rescue
    precious me. Good gracious! No wonder you were excited."</p>

    <p>The sailor mentally expressed his inability to grasp the
    complexities of feminine nature, but Iris rattled on&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I carried my tin of water to the pitcher-plant, and was
    listening to the greedy roots gurgling away for dear life, when
    suddenly four men sprang out from among the trees and seized my
    arms before I could reach my revolver."</p>

    <p>"Thank Heaven you failed."</p>

    <p>"You think that if I had fired at them they would have
    retaliated. Yes, especially if I had hit the chief. But it was
    he who instantly gave some order, and I suppose it meant that
    they were not to hurt me. As a matter of fact, they seemed to
    be quite as much astonished as I was alarmed. But if they could
    hold my hands they could not stop my voice so readily. Oh!
    didn't I yell?"</p>

    <p>"You did."</p>

    <p>"I suppose you could not hear me distinctly?"</p>

    <p>"Quite distinctly."</p>

    <p>"Every word?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>She bent to pick some leaves and bits of dry grass from her
    dress. "Well, you know," she continued rapidly, "in such
    moments one cannot choose one's words. I just shouted the first
    thing that came into my head."</p>

    <p>"And I," he said, "picked up the first rifle I could lay
    hands on. Now, Miss Deane, as the affair has ended so happily,
    may I venture to ask you to remain in the cave until I
    return?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, please&mdash;" she began.</p>

    <p>"Really, I must insist. I would not leave you if it were not
    quite imperative. You <i>cannot</i> come with me."</p>

    <p>Then she understood one at least of the tasks he must
    perform, and she meekly obeyed.</p>

    <p>He thought it best to go along Turtle Beach to the cove, and
    thence follow the Dyaks' trail through the wood, as this line
    of advance would entail practically a complete circuit of the
    island. He omitted no precautions in his advance. Often he
    stopped and listened intently. Whenever he doubled a point or
    passed among the trees he crept back and peered along the way
    he had come, to see if any lurking foes were breaking shelter
    behind him.</p>

    <p>The marks on the sand proved that only one sampan had been
    beached. Thence he found nothing of special interest until he
    came upon the chief's gun, lying close to the trees on the
    north side. It was a very ornamental weapon, a muzzle-loader.
    The stock was inlaid with gold and ivory, and the piece had
    evidently been looted from some mandarin's junk surprised and
    sacked in a former foray.</p>

    <p>The lock was smashed by the impact of the Lee-Metford
    bullet, but close investigation of the trigger-guard, and the
    discovery of certain unmistakable evidences on the beach,
    showed that the Dyak leader had lost two if not three fingers
    of his right hand.</p>

    <p>"So he has something more than his passion to nurse," mused
    Jenks. "That at any rate is fortunate. He will be in no mood
    for further enterprise for some time to come."</p>

    <p>He dreaded lest any of the Dyaks should be only badly
    wounded and likely to live. It was an actual relief to his
    nerves to find that the improvised Dum-dums had done their work
    too well to permit anxiety on that score. On the principle that
    a "dead Injun is a good Injun" these Dyaks were good Dyaks.</p>

    <p>He gathered the guns, swords and krisses of the slain, with
    all their uncouth belts and ornaments. In pursuance of a
    vaguely defined plan of future action he also divested some of
    the men of their coarse garments, and collected six
    queer-looking hats, shaped like inverted basins. These things
    he placed in a heap near the pitcher-plants. Thenceforth, for
    half an hour, the placid surface of the lagoon was disturbed by
    the black dorsal fins of many sharks.</p>

    <p>To one of the sailor's temperament there was nothing
    revolting in the concluding portion of his task. He had a
    God-given right to live. It was his paramount duty, remitted
    only by death itself, to endeavor to save Iris from the
    indescribable fate from which no power could rescue her if ever
    she fell into the hands of these vindictive savages. Therefore
    it was war between him and them, war to the bitter end, war
    with no humane mitigation of its horrors and penalties, the
    last dread arbitrament of man forced to adopt the methods of
    the tiger.</p>

    <p>His guess at the weather conditions heralded by the change
    of wind was right. As the two partook of their evening meal the
    complaining surf lashed the reef, and the tremulous branches of
    the taller trees voiced the approach of a gale. A tropical
    storm, not a typhoon, but a belated burst of the periodic
    rains, deluged the island before midnight. Hours earlier Iris
    retired, utterly worn by the events of the day. Needless to
    say, there was no singing that evening. The gale chanted a wild
    melody in mournful chords, and the noise of the watery downpour
    on the tarpaulin roof of Belle Vue Castle was such as to render
    conversation impossible, save in wearying shouts.</p>

    <p>Luckily, Jenks's carpentry was effective, though rough. The
    building was water-tight, and he had calked every crevice with
    unraveled rope until Iris's apartment was free from the tiniest
    draught.</p>

    <p>The very fury of the external turmoil acted as a lullaby to
    the girl. She was soon asleep, and the sailor was left to his
    thoughts.</p>

    <p>Sleep he could not. He smoked steadily, with a magnificent
    prodigality, for his small stock of tobacco was fast
    diminishing. He ransacked his brains to discover some method of
    escape from this enchanted island, where fairies jostled with
    demons, and hours of utter happiness found their bane in
    moments of frightful peril.</p>

    <p>Of course he ought to have killed those fellows who escaped.
    Their sampan might have provided a last desperate expedient if
    other savages effected a landing. Well, there was no use in
    being wise after the event, and, scheme as he might, he could
    devise no way to avoid disaster during the next attack.</p>

    <p>This, he felt certain, would take place at night. The Dyaks
    would land in force, rush the cave and hut, and overpower him
    by sheer numbers. The fight, if fight there was, would be
    sharp, but decisive. Perhaps, if he received some warning, Iris
    and he might retreat in the darkness to the cover of the trees.
    A last stand could be made among the boulders on Summit Rock.
    But of what avail to purchase their freedom until daylight? And
    then&mdash;</p>

    <p>If ever man wrestled with desperate problem, Jenks wrought
    that night. He smoked and pondered until the storm passed, and,
    with the changefulness of a poet's muse, a full moon flooded
    the island in glorious radiance. He rose, opened the door, and
    stood without, listening for a little while to the roaring of
    the surf and the crash of the broken coral swept from reef and
    shore by the backwash.</p>

    <p>The petty strife of the elements was soothing to him. "They
    are snarling like whipped dogs," he said aloud. "One might
    almost fancy her ladyship the Moon appearing on the scene as a
    Uranian Venus, cowing sea and storm by the majesty of her
    presence."</p>

    <p>Pleased with the conceit, he looked steadily at the
    brilliant luminary for some time. Then his eyes were attracted
    by the strong lights thrown upon the rugged face of the
    precipice into which the cavern burrowed. Unconsciously
    relieving his tired senses, he was idly wondering what trick of
    color Turner would have adopted to convey those sharp yet
    weirdly beautiful contrasts, when suddenly he uttered a
    startled exclamation.</p>

    <p>"By Jove!" he murmured. "I never noticed that before."</p>

    <p>The feature which so earnestly claimed his attention was a
    deep ledge, directly over the mouth of the cave, but some forty
    feet from the ground. Behind it the wall of rock sloped darkly
    inwards, suggesting a recess extending by haphazard computation
    at least a couple of yards. It occurred to him that perhaps the
    fault in the interior of the tunnel had its outcrop here, and
    the deodorizing influences of rain and sun had extended the
    weak point thus exposed in the bold panoply of stone.</p>

    <p>He surveyed the ledge from different points of view. It was
    quite inaccessible, and most difficult to estimate accurately
    from the ground level. The sailor was a man of action. He chose
    the nearest tall tree and began to climb. He was not eight feet
    from the ground before several birds flew out from its leafy
    recesses, filling the air with shrill clucking.</p>

    <p>"The devil take them!" he growled, for he feared that the
    commotion would awaken Iris. He was still laboriously worming
    his way through the inner maze of branches when a well-known
    voice reached him from the ground.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Jenks, what on earth are you doing up there?"</p>

    <p>"Oh! so those wretched fowls aroused you?" he replied.</p>

    <p>"Yes; but why did you arouse them?"</p>

    <p>"I had a fancy to roost by way of a change"</p>

    <p>"Please be serious."</p>

    <p>"I am more than serious. This tree grows a variety of small
    sharp thorn that induces a maximum of gravity&mdash;before one
    takes the next step."</p>

    <p>"But why do you keep on climbing?"</p>

    <p>"It is sheer lunacy, I admit. Yet on such a moonlit night
    there is some reasonable ground for even a mad excuse."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Jenks, tell me at once what you are doing."</p>

    <p>Iris strove to be severe, but there was a touch of anxiety
    in her tone that instantly made the sailor apologetic. He told
    her about the ledge, and explained his half-formed notion that
    here they might secure a safe retreat in case of further
    attack&mdash;a refuge from which they might defy assault during
    many days. It was, he said, absolutely impossible to wait until
    the morning. He must at once satisfy himself whether the
    project was impracticable or worthy of further
    investigation.</p>

    <p>So the girl only enjoined him to be careful, and he
    vigorously renewed the climb. At last, some twenty-five feet
    from the ground, an accidental parting in the branches enabled
    him to get a good look at the ledge. One glance set his heart
    beating joyously. It was at least fifteen feet in length; it
    shelved back until its depth was lost in the blackness of the
    shadows, and the floor must be either nearly level or sloping
    slightly inwards to the line of the fault.</p>

    <p>The place was a perfect eagle's nest. A chamois could not
    reach it from any direction; it became accessible to man only
    by means of a ladder or a balloon.</p>

    <p>More excited by this discovery than he cared for Iris to
    know, he endeavored to appear unconcerned when he regained the
    ground.</p>

    <p>"Well," she said, "tell me all about it."</p>

    <p>He described the nature of the cavity as well as he
    understood it at the moment, and emphasized his previous
    explanation of its virtues. Here they might reasonably hope to
    make a successful stand against the Dyaks.</p>

    <p>"Then you feel sure that those awful creatures will come
    back?" she said slowly.</p>

    <p>"Only too sure, unfortunately."</p>

    <p>"How remorseless poor humanity is when the veneer is
    stripped off! Why cannot they leave us in peace? I suppose they
    now cherish a blood feud against us. Perhaps, if I had not been
    here, they would not have injured you. Somehow I seem to be
    bound up with your misfortunes."</p>

    <p>"I would not have it otherwise were it in my power," he
    answered. For an instant he left unchallenged the girl's
    assumption that she was in any way responsible for the
    disasters which had broken up his career. He looked into her
    eyes and almost forgot himself. Then the sense of fair dealing
    that dominates every true gentleman rose within him and gripped
    his wavering emotions with ruthless force. Was this a time to
    play upon the high-strung sensibilities of this youthful
    daughter of the gods, to seek to win from her a confession of
    love that a few brief days or weeks might prove to be only a
    spasmodic, but momentarily all-powerful, gratitude for the
    protection he had given her?</p>

    <p>And he spoke aloud, striving to laugh, lest his words should
    falter&mdash;</p>

    <p>"You can console yourself with the thought, Miss Deane, that
    your presence on the island will in no way affect my fate at
    the hands of the Dyaks. Had they caught me unprepared today my
    head would now be covered with a solution of the special
    varnish they carry on every foreign expedition."</p>

    <p>"Varnish?" she exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"Yes, as a preservative, you understand."</p>

    <p>"And yet these men are human beings!"</p>

    <p>"For purposes of classification, yes. Keeping to strict
    fact, it was lucky for me that you raised the alarm, and gave
    me a chance to discount the odds of mere numbers. So, you see,
    you really did me a good turn."</p>

    <p>"What can be done now to save our lives? Anything will be
    better than to await another attack."</p>

    <p>"The first thing to do is to try to get some sleep before
    daylight. How did you know I was not in the Castle?"</p>

    <p>"I cannot tell you. I awoke and knew you were not near me.
    If I wake in the night I can always tell whether or not you are
    in the next room. So I dressed and came out."</p>

    <p>"Ah!" he said, quietly. "Evidently I snore."</p>

    <p>This explanation killed romance.</p>

    <p>Iris retreated and the sailor, tired out at last, managed to
    close his weary eyes.</p>

    <p>Next morning he hastily constructed a pole of sufficient
    length and strong enough to bear his weight, by tying two
    sturdy young trees together with ropes. Iris helped him to
    raise it against the face of the precipice, and he at once
    climbed to the ledge.</p>

    <p>Here he found his observations of the previous night
    abundantly verified. The ledge was even wider than he dared to
    hope, nearly ten feet deep in one part, and it sloped sharply
    downwards from the outer lip of the rock. By lying flat and
    carefully testing all points of view, he ascertained that the
    only possible positions from which even a glimpse of the
    interior floor could be obtained were the branches of a few
    tall trees and the extreme right of the opposing precipice,
    nearly ninety yards distant. There was ample room to store
    water and provisions, and he quickly saw that even some sort of
    shelter from the fierce rays of the sun and the often piercing
    cold of the night might be achieved by judiciously rigging up a
    tarpaulin.</p>

    <p>"This is a genuine bit of good luck," he mused. "Here,
    provided neither of us is hit, we can hold out for a week or
    longer, at a pinch. How can it be possible that I should have
    lived on this island so many days and yet hit upon this nook of
    safety by mere chance, as it were?"</p>

    <p>Not until he reached the level again could he solve the
    puzzle. Then he perceived that the way in which the cliff
    bulged out on both sides prevented the ledge from becoming
    evident in profile, whilst, seen <i>en plein face</i> in the
    glare of the sunlight, it suggested nothing more than a slight
    indentation.</p>

    <p>He rapidly sketched to Iris the defensive plan which the
    Eagle's Nest suggested. Access must be provided by means of a
    rope-ladder, securely fastened inside the ledge, and capable of
    being pulled up or let down at the will of the occupants. Then
    the place must be kept constantly stocked with a judicious
    supply of provisions, water, and ammunition. They could be
    covered with a tarpaulin, and thus kept in fairly good
    condition.</p>

    <p>"We ought to sleep there every night," he went on, and his
    mind was so engrossed with the tactical side of the
    preparations that he did not notice how Iris blanched at the
    suggestion.</p>

    <p>"Surely not until danger actually threatens?" she cried.</p>

    <p>"Danger threatens us each hour after sunset. It may come any
    night, though I expect at least a fortnight's reprieve.
    Nevertheless, I intend to act as if tonight may witness the
    first shot of the siege."</p>

    <p>"Do you mean that?" she sighed. "And my little room is
    becoming so very cozy!"</p>

    <p>Belle Vue Castle, their two-roomed hut, was already a home
    to them.</p>

    <p>Jenks always accepted her words literally.</p>

    <p>"Well," he announced, after a pause, "it may not be
    necessary to take up our quarters there until the eleventh
    hour. After I have hoisted up our stores and made the ladder, I
    will endeavor to devise an efficient cordon of sentinels around
    our position. We will see."</p>

    <p>Not another word could Iris get out of him on the topic.
    Indeed, he provided her with plenty of work. By this time she
    could splice a rope more neatly than her tutor, and her
    particular business was to prepare no less than sixty rungs for
    the rope-ladder. This was an impossible task for one day, but
    after dinner the sailor helped her. They toiled late, until
    their fingers were sore and their backbones creaked as they sat
    upright.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Jenks swarmed up the pole again, and drew up after
    him a crowbar, the sledge-hammer, and the pickaxe. With these
    implements he set to work to improve the accommodation. Of
    course he did not attempt seriously to remove any large
    quantity of rock, but there were projecting lumps here and
    inequalities of floor there which could be thumped or pounded
    out of existence.</p>

    <p>It was surprising to see what a clearance he made in an
    hour. The existence of the fault helped him a good deal, as the
    percolation of water at this point had oxidized the stone to
    rottenness. To his great joy he discovered that a few prods
    with the pick laid bare a small cavity which could be easily
    enlarged. Here he contrived a niche where Iris could remain in
    absolute safety when barricaded by stores, whilst, with a
    squeeze, she was entirely sheltered from the one dangerous
    point on the opposite cliff, nor need she be seen from the
    trees.</p>

    <p>Having hauled into position two boxes of
    ammunition&mdash;for which he had scooped out a special
    receptacle&mdash;the invaluable water-kegs from the stranded
    boat, several tins of biscuits and all the tinned meats,
    together with three bottles of wine and two of brandy, he
    hastily abandoned the ledge and busied himself with fitting a
    number of gun-locks to heavy faggots.</p>

    <p>Iris watched his proceedings in silence for some time. At
    last the interval for luncheon enabled her to demand an
    explanation.</p>

    <p>"If you don't tell me at once what you intend to do with
    those strange implements," she said, "I will form myself into
    an amalgamated engineer and come out on strike."</p>

    <p>"If you do," he answered, "you will create a precedent.
    There is no recorded case of a laborer claiming what he calls
    his rights when his life is at stake. Even an American tramp
    has been known to work like a fiend under that condition."</p>

    <p>"Simply because an American tramp tries, like every other
    mere male, to be logical. A woman is more heroic. I once read
    of a French lady being killed during an earthquake because she
    insisted on going into a falling house to rescue that portion
    of her hair which usually rested on the dressing-table whilst
    she was asleep."</p>

    <p>"I happen to know," he said, "that you are personally
    unqualified to emulate her example."</p>

    <p>She laughed merrily, so lightly did yesterday's adventure
    sit upon her. The allusion to her disheveled state when they
    were thrown ashore by the typhoon simply impressed her as
    amusing. Thus quickly had she become inured to the strange
    circumstances of a new life.</p>

    <p>"I withdraw the threat and substitute a more genuine
    plea&mdash;curiosity," she cried.</p>

    <p>"Then you will be gratified promptly. These are our
    sentinels. Come with me to allot his post to the most distant
    one."</p>

    <p>He picked up a faggot with its queer attachment, shouldered
    a Lee-Metford, and smiled when he saw the business-like air
    with which Iris slung a revolver around her waist.</p>

    <p>They walked rapidly to Smugglers' Cove, and the girl soon
    perceived the ingenuity of his automatic signal. He securely
    bound the block of wood to a tree where it was hidden by the
    undergrowth. Breaking the bullet out of a cartridge, he placed
    the blank charge in position in front of the striker, the case
    being firmly clasped by a bent nail. To the trigger, the spring
    of which he had eased to a slight pressure, he attached a piece
    of unraveled rope, and this he carefully trained among the
    trees at a height of six inches from the ground, using as
    carriers nails driven into the trunks. The ultimate result was
    that a mere swish of Iris's dress against the taut cord
    exploded the cartridge.</p>

    <p>"There!" he exclaimed, exultantly. "When I have driven
    stakes into the sand to the water's edge on both sides of the
    cove, I will defy them to land by night without giving us
    warning."</p>

    <p>"Do you know," said Iris, in all seriousness, "I think you
    are the cleverest man in the world."</p>

    <p>"My dear Miss Deane, that is not at all a Trades Unionist
    sentiment. Equality is the key-note of their propaganda."</p>

    <p>Nevertheless he was manifestly pleased by the success of his
    ingenious contrivance, and forthwith completed the cordon. To
    make doubly sure, he set another snare further within the
    trees. He was certain the Dyaks would not pass along Turtle
    Beach if they could help it. By this time the light was
    failing.</p>

    <p>"That will suffice for the present," he told the girl.
    "Tomorrow we will place other sentries in position at strategic
    points. Then we can sleep in the Castle with tolerable
    safety."</p>

    <p>By the meager light of the tiny lamp they labored sedulously
    at the rope-ladder until Iris's eyes were closing with sheer
    weariness. Neither of them had slept much during the preceding
    night, and they were both completely tired.</p>

    <p>It was with a very weak little smile that the girl bade him
    "good night," and they were soon wrapped in that sound slumber
    which comes only from health, hard work, and wholesome
    fare.</p>

    <p>The first streaks of dawn were tipping the opposite crags
    with roseate tints when the sailor was suddenly aroused by what
    he believed to be a gunshot. He could not be sure. He was still
    collecting his scattered senses, straining eyes and ears
    intensely, when there came a second report.</p>

    <p>Then he knew what had happened. The sentries on the
    Smugglers' Cove post were faithful to their trust. The enemy
    was upon them.</p>

    <p>At such a moment Jenks was not a man who prayed. Indeed, he
    was prone to invoke the nether powers, a habit long since
    acquired by the British army, in Flanders, it is believed.</p>

    <p>There was not a moment to be lost. He rushed into Iris's
    room, and gathered in his arms both her and the weird medley of
    garments that covered her. He explained to the protesting girl,
    as he ran with her to the foot of the rock, that she must cling
    to his shoulders with unfaltering courage whilst he climbed to
    the ledge with the aid of the pole and the rope placed there
    the previous day. It was a magnificent feat of strength that he
    essayed. In calmer moments he would have shrunk from its
    performance, if only on the score of danger to the precious
    burden he carried. Now there was no time for thought. Up he
    went, hand over hand, clinging to the rough pole with the
    tenacity of a limpet, and taking a turn of the rope over his
    right wrist at each upward clutch. At last, breathless but
    triumphant, he reached the ledge, and was able to gasp his
    instructions to Iris to crawl over his bent back and head until
    she was safely lodged on the broad platform of rock.</p>

    <p>Then, before she could expostulate, he descended, this time
    for the rifles. These he hastily slung to the rope, again
    swarmed up the pole, and drew the guns after him with infinite
    care.</p>

    <p>Even in the whirl of the moment he noticed that Iris had
    managed to partially complete her costume.</p>

    <p>"Now we are ready for them," he growled, lying prone on the
    ledge and eagerly scanning both sides of Prospect Park for a
    first glimpse of their assailants.</p>

    <p>For two shivering hours they waited there, until the sun was
    high over the cliff and filled sea and land with his
    brightness. At last, despite the girl's tears and prayers,
    Jenks insisted on making a reconnaissance in person.</p>

    <p>Let this portion of their adventures be passed over with
    merciful brevity. Both watch-guns had been fired by the troupe
    of tiny wou-wou monkeys! Iris did not know whether to laugh or
    cry, when Jenks, with much difficulty, lowered her to mother
    earth again, and marveled the while how he had managed to carry
    forty feet into the air a young woman who weighed so
    solidly.</p>

    <p>They sat down to a belated breakfast, and Jenks then became
    conscious that the muscles of his arms, legs, and back were
    aching hugely. It was by that means he could judge the true
    extent of his achievement. Iris, too, realized it gradually,
    but, like the Frenchwoman in the earthquake, she was too
    concerned with memories of her state of deshabille to
    appreciate, all at once, the incidents of the dawn.</p>
    <hr>
    <a name="CHAPTER_IX"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

    <h2>THE SECRET OF THE CAVE</h2>

    <p>The sailor went after those monkeys in a mood of relentless
    severity. Thus far, the regular denizens of Rainbow Island had
    dwelt together in peace and mutual goodwill, but each
    diminutive wou-wou must be taught not to pull any strings he
    found tied promiscuously to trees or stakes. As a preliminary
    essay, Jenks resolved to try force combined with artifice.
    Failing complete success, he would endeavor to kill every
    monkey in the place, though he had in full measure the inherent
    dislike of Anglo-India to the slaying of the tree-people.</p>

    <p>This, then, is what he did. After filling a biscuit tin with
    good-sized pebbles, he donned a Dyak hat, blouse, and belt,
    rubbed earth over his face and hands, and proceeded to pelt the
    wou-wous mercilessly. For more than an hour he made their lives
    miserable, until at the mere sight of him they fled, shrieking
    and gurgling like a thousand water-bottles. Finally he
    constructed several Dyak scarecrows and erected one to guard
    each of his alarm-guns. The device was thoroughly effective.
    Thenceforth, when some adventurous monkey&mdash;swinging with
    hands or tail among the treetops in the morning search for
    appetizing nut or luscious plantain&mdash;saw one of those
    fearsome bogies, he raised such a hubbub that all his
    companions scampered hastily from the confines of the wood to
    the inner fastnesses.</p>

    <p>In contriving these same scarecrows&mdash;which, by the way,
    he had vaguely intended at first to erect on the beach in order
    to frighten the invaders and induce them to fire a warning
    volley&mdash;the sailor paid closer heed to the spoils gathered
    from the fallen. One, at least, of the belts was made of human
    hair, and some among its long strands could have come only from
    the flaxen-haired head of a European child. This fact, though
    ghastly enough, confirmed him in his theory that it was
    impossible to think of temporizing with these human fiends.
    Unhappily such savage virtues as they possess do not include
    clemency to the weak or hospitality to defenceless strangers.
    There was nothing for it but a fight to a finish, with the law
    of the jungle to decide the terms of conquest.</p>

    <p>That morning, of course, he had not been able to visit
    Summit Rock until after his cautious survey of the island. Once
    there, however, he noticed that the gale two nights earlier had
    loosened two of the supports of his sky sign. It was not a
    difficult or a long job to repair the damage. With the
    invaluable axe he cut several wedges and soon made all
    secure.</p>

    <p>Now, during each of the two daily examinations of the
    horizon which he never omitted, he minutely scrutinized the sea
    between Rainbow Island and the distant group. It was, perhaps,
    a needless precaution. The Dyaks would come at night. With a
    favorable wind they need not set sail until dusk, and their
    fleet sampans would easily cover the intervening forty miles in
    five hours.</p>

    <p>He could not be positive that they were actual inhabitants
    of the islands to the south. The China Sea swarms with
    wandering pirates, and the tribe whose animosity he had earned
    might be equally noxious to some peaceable fishing community on
    the coast. Again and again he debated the advisability of
    constructing a seaworthy raft and endeavoring to make the
    passage. But this would be risking all on a frightful
    uncertainty, and the accidental discovery of the Eagle's Nest
    had given him new hope. Here he could make a determined and
    prolonged stand, and in the end help <i>must</i> come. So he
    dismissed the navigation project, and devoted himself wholly to
    the perfecting of the natural fortress in the rock.</p>

    <p>That night they finished the rope-ladder. Indeed, Jenks was
    determined not to retire to rest until it was placed <i>in
    situ</i>; he did not care to try a second time to carry Iris to
    that elevated perch, and it may be remarked that thenceforth
    the girl, before going to sleep, simply changed one ragged
    dress for another.</p>

    <p>One of the first things he contemplated was the destruction,
    if possible, of the point on the opposite cliff which commanded
    the ledge. This, however, was utterly impracticable with the
    appliances at his command. The top of the rock sloped slightly
    towards the west, and nothing short of dynamite or regular
    quarrying operations would render it untenable by hostile
    marksmen.</p>

    <p>During the day his Lee-Metfords, at ninety yards' range,
    might be trusted to keep the place clear of intruders. But at
    night&mdash;that was the difficulty. He partially solved it by
    fixing two rests on the ledge to support a rifle in exact line
    with the center of the enemy's supposed position, and as a
    variant, on the outer rest he marked lines which corresponded
    with other sections of the entire front available to the
    foe.</p>

    <p>Even then he was not satisfied. When time permitted he made
    many experiments with ropes reeved through the pulley and
    attached to a rifle action. He might have succeeded in his main
    object had not his thoughts taken a new line. His aim was to
    achieve some method of opening and closing the breech-block by
    means of two ropes. The difficulty was to secure the
    preliminary and final lateral movement of the lever bolt, but
    it suddenly occurred to him that if he could manage to convey
    the impression that Iris and he had left the island, the Dyaks
    would go away after a fruitless search. The existence of ropes
    along the face of the rock&mdash;an essential to his mechanical
    scheme&mdash;would betray their whereabouts, or at any rate
    excite dangerous curiosity. So he reluctantly abandoned his
    original design, though not wholly, as will be seen in due
    course.</p>

    <p>In pursuance of his latest idea he sedulously removed from
    the foot of the cliff all traces of the clearance effected on
    the ledge, and, although he provided supports for the tarpaulin
    covering, he did not adjust it. Iris and he might lie
    <i>perdu</i> there for days without their retreat being found
    out. This development suggested the necessity of hiding their
    surplus stores and ammunition, and what spot could be more
    suitable than the cave?</p>

    <p>So Jenks began to dig once more in the interior, laboring
    manfully with pick and shovel in the locality of the fault with
    its vein of antimony. It was thus that he blundered upon the
    second great event of his life.</p>

    <p>Rainbow Island had given him the one thing a man prizes
    above all else&mdash;a pure yet passionate love for a woman
    beautiful alike in body and mind. And now it was to endow him
    with riches that might stir the pulse of even a South African
    magnate. For the sailor, unmindful of purpose other than
    providing the requisite <i>cache</i>, shoveling and delving
    with the energy peculiar to all his actions, suddenly struck a
    deep vein of almost virgin gold.</p>

    <p>To facilitate the disposal at a distance of the disturbed
    debris, he threw each shovelful on to a canvas sheet, which he
    subsequently dragged among the trees in order to dislodge its
    contents. After doing this four times he noticed certain
    metallic specks in the fifth load which recalled the presence
    of the antimony. But the appearance of the sixth cargo was so
    remarkable when brought out into the sunlight that it invited
    closer inspection. Though his knowledge of geology was
    slight&mdash;the half-forgotten gleanings of a brief course at
    Eton&mdash;he was forced to believe that the specimens he
    handled so dubiously contained neither copper nor iron pyrites
    but glittering yellow gold. Their weight, the distribution of
    the metal through quartz in a transition state between an oxide
    and a telluride, compelled recognition.</p>

    <p>Somewhat excited, yet half skeptical, he returned to the
    excavation and scooped out yet another collection. This time
    there could be no mistake. Nature's own alchemy had fashioned a
    veritable ingot. There were small lumps in the ore which would
    need alloy at the mint before they could be issued as
    sovereigns, so free from dross were they.</p>

    <p>Iris had gone to Venus's Bath, and would be absent for some
    time. Jenks sat down on a tree-stump. He held in his hand a
    small bit of ore worth perhaps twenty pounds sterling. Slowly
    the conjectures already pieced together in his mind during
    early days on the island came back to him.</p>

    <p>The skeleton of an Englishman lying there among the bushes
    near the well; the Golgotha of the poison-filled hollow; the
    mining tools, both Chinese and European; the plan on the piece
    of tin&mdash;ah, the piece of tin! Mechanically the sailor
    produced it from the breast-pocket of his jersey. At last the
    mysterious sign "32/1" revealed its significance.
    Measure thirty-two feet from the mouth of the tunnel, dig one
    foot in depth, and you came upon the mother-lode of this
    gold-bearing rock. This, then, was the secret of the cave.</p>

    <p>The Chinese knew the richness of the deposit, and exploited
    its treasures by quarrying from the other side of the hill. But
    their crass ignorance of modern science led to their undoing.
    The accumulation of liberated carbonic acid gas in the workings
    killed them in scores. They probably fought this unseen demon
    with the tenacity of their race, until the place became
    accursed and banned of all living things. Yet had they dug a
    little ditch, and permitted the invisible terror to flow
    quietly downwards until its potency was dissipated by sea and
    air, they might have mined the whole cliff with impunity.</p>

    <p>The unfortunate unknown, J.S.&mdash;he of the whitened
    bones&mdash;might have done this thing too. But he only
    possessed the half-knowledge of the working miner, and whilst
    shunning the plague-stricken quarry, adopted the more laborious
    method of making an adit to strike the deposit. He succeeded,
    to perish miserably in the hour when he saw himself a
    millionaire.</p>

    <p>Was this a portent of the fate about to overtake the latest
    comers? Jenks, of course, stood up. He always, stood square on
    his feet when the volcano within him fired his blood.</p>

    <p>"No, by God!" he almost shouted. "I will break the spell. I
    am sent here by Providence, not to search for gold but to save
    a woman's life, and if all the devils of China and Malay are in
    league against me I will beat them!"</p>

    <p>The sound of his own voice startled him. He had no notion
    that he was so hysterical. Promptly his British phlegm
    throttled the demonstration. He was rather ashamed of it.</p>

    <p>What was all the fuss about? With a barrow-load of gold he
    could not buy an instant's safety for Iris, not to mention
    himself. The language difficulty was insuperable. Were it
    otherwise, the Dyaks would simply humbug him until he revealed
    the source of his wealth, and then murder him as an effective
    safeguard against foreign interference.</p>

    <p>Iris! Not once since she was hurled ashore in his arms had
    Jenks so long forgotten her existence. Should he tell her? They
    were partners in everything appertaining to the
    island&mdash;why keep this marvelous intelligence from her?</p>

    <p>Yet was he tempted, not ignobly, but by reason of his love
    for her. Once, years ago, when his arduous professional studies
    were distracted by a momentary infatuation for a fair face, a
    woman had proved fickle when tempted by greater wealth than he
    possessed. For long he was a confirmed misogynist, to his great
    and lasting gain as a leader of men. But with more equable
    judgment came a fixed resolution not to marry unless his
    prospective bride cared only for him and not for his position.
    To a Staff Corps officer, even one with a small private income,
    this was no unattainable ideal. Then he met with his
    <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> in the shame and agony of the
    court-martial. Whilst his soul still quivered under the lash of
    that terrible downfall, Iris came into his life. He knew not
    what might happen if they were rescued. The time would quickly
    pass until the old order was resumed, she to go back to her
    position in society, he to become again a disgraced ex-officer,
    apparently working out a mere existence before the mast or
    handing plates in a saloon.</p>

    <p>Would it not be a sweet defiance of adversity were he able,
    even under such conditions, to win her love, and then disclose
    to her the potentialities of the island? Perchance he might
    fail. Though rich as Croesus he would still be under the social
    ban meted out to a cashiered officer. She was a girl who could
    command the gift of coronets. With restoration to her father
    and home, gratitude to her preserver would assuredly remain,
    but, alas! love might vanish like a mirage. Then he would act
    honorably. Half of the stored wealth would be hers to do as she
    chose with it.</p>

    <p>Yes, this was a possible alternative. In case of accident to
    himself, and her ultimate escape, he must immediately write
    full details of his discovery, and entrust the document to her,
    to be opened only after his death or six months after their
    release.</p>

    <p>The idea possessed him so thoroughly that he could brook no
    delay. He searched for one of the note-books taken from the
    dead officers of the <i>Sirdar</i>, and scribbled the following
    letter:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"DEAR MISS DEANE:</p>

        <p>"Whether I am living or dead when you read these words,
        you will know that I love you. Could I repeat that avowal a
        million times, in as many varied forms, I should find no
        better phrase to express the dream I have cherished since a
        happy fate permitted me to snatch you from death. So I
        simply say, 'I love you.' I will continue to love you
        whilst life lasts, and it is my dearest hope that in the
        life beyond the grave I may still be able to voice my love
        for you.</p>

        <p>"But perhaps I am not destined to be loved by you.
        Therefore, in the event of my death before you leave the
        island, I wish to give you instructions how to find a gold
        mine of great value which is hidden in the rock containing
        the cave. You remember the sign on the piece of tin which
        we could not understand. The figure 32 denotes the utmost
        depth of the excavation, and the 1 signifies that one foot
        below the surface, on reaching the face of the rock, there
        is a rich vein of gold. The hollow on the other side of the
        cliff became filled with anhydrate gas, and this stopped
        the operations of the Chinese, who evidently knew of the
        existence of the mine. This is all the information the
        experts employed by Sir Arthur Deane will need. The facts
        are unquestionable.</p>

        <p>"Assuming that I am alive, we will, of course, be
        co-partners in the mine. If I am dead, I wish one-sixth
        share to be given to my uncle, William Anstruther,
        Crossthwaite Manor, Northallerton, Yorkshire, as a
        recompense for his kindness to me during my early life. The
        remainder is to be yours absolutely.</p>

        <p class="author">"ROBERT ANSTRUTHER."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>He read this remarkable document twice through to make sure
    that it exactly recorded his sentiments. He even smiled
    sarcastically at the endowment of the uncle who disinherited
    him. Then, satisfied with the perusal, he tore out the two
    leaves covered by the letter and began to devise a means of
    protecting it securely whilst in Iris's possession.</p>

    <p>At that moment he looked up and saw her coming towards him
    across the beach, brightly flushed after her bath, walking like
    a nymph clothed in tattered garments. Perceiving that he was
    watching her, she waved her hand and instinctively quickened
    her pace. Even now, when they were thrown together by the
    exigencies of each hour, she disliked to be long separated from
    him.</p>

    <p>Instantly the scales fell from his mental vision. What!
    Distrust Iris! Imagine for one second that riches or poverty,
    good repute or ill, would affect that loyal heart when its
    virginal font was filled with the love that once in her life
    comes to every true woman! Perish the thought! What evil spirit
    had power to so blind his perception of all that was strong and
    beautiful in her character. Brave, uncomplaining Iris! Iris of
    the crystal soul! Iris, whose innocence and candor were
    mirrored in her blue eyes and breathed through her dear lips!
    Here was Othello acting as his own tempter, with not an Iago
    within a thousand miles.</p>

    <p>Laughing at his fantastic folly, Jenks tore the letter into
    little pieces. It might have been wiser to throw the sheets
    into the embers of the fire close at hand, but for the nonce he
    was overpowered by the great awakening that had come to him,
    and he unconsciously murmured the musical lines of Tennyson's
    "Maud":</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"She is coming, my own, my sweet;</p>

            <p class="i4">Were it ever so airy a tread.</p>

            <p>My heart would hear her and beat</p>

            <p class="i4">Were it earth in an earthy bed;</p>

            <p>My dust would hear her and beat,</p>

            <p class="i4">Had I lain for a century dead,</p>

            <p>Would start and tremble under her feet,</p>

            <p class="i4">And blossom in purple and red."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"Good gracious! Don't gaze at me in that fashion. I don't
    look like a ghost, do I?" cried Iris, when near enough to note
    his rapt expression.</p>

    <p>"You would not object if I called you a vision?" he inquired
    quietly, averting his eyes lest they should speak more plainly
    than his tongue.</p>

    <p>"Not if you meant it nicely. But I fear that 'specter' would
    be a more appropriate word. <i>V'la ma meilleure robe de
    sortie</i>!"</p>

    <p>She spread out the front widths of her skirt, and certainly
    the prospect was lamentable. The dress was so patched and
    mended, yet so full of fresh rents, that a respectable
    housemaid would hesitate before using it to clean
    fire-irons.</p>

    <p>"Is that really your best dress?" he said.</p>

    <p>"Yes. This is my blue serge. The brown cloth did not survive
    the soaking it received in salt water. After a few days it
    simply crumbled. The others are muslin or cotton, and have
    been&mdash;er&mdash;adapted."</p>

    <p>"There is plenty of men's clothing," he began.</p>

    <p>"Unfortunately there isn't another island," she said,
    severely.</p>

    <p>"No. I meant that it might be possible
    to&mdash;er&mdash;contrive some sort of rig that will serve all
    purposes."</p>

    <p>"But all my thread is gone. I have barely a needleful
    left."</p>

    <p>"In that case we must fall back on our supply of hemp."</p>

    <p>"I suppose that might be made to serve," she said. "You are
    never at a loss for an expedient."</p>

    <p>"It will be a poor one, I fear. But you can make up for it
    by buying some nice gowns at Doucet's or Worth's."</p>

    <p>She laughed delightedly. "Perhaps in his joy at my
    reappearance my dear old dad may let me run riot in Paris on
    our way home. But that will not last. We are fairly well off,
    but I cannot afford ten thousand a year for dress alone."</p>

    <p>"If any woman can afford such a sum for the purpose, you are
    at least her equal."</p>

    <p>Iris looked puzzled. "Is that your way of telling me that
    fine feathers would make me a fine bird?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"No. I intend my words to be understood in their ordinary
    sense. You are very, very rich, Miss Deane&mdash;an
    extravagantly wealthy young person."</p>

    <p>"Of course you know you are talking nonsense. Why, only the
    other day my father said&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Excuse me. What is the average price of a walking-dress
    from a leading Paris house?"</p>

    <p>"Thirty pounds."</p>

    <p>"And an evening dress?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, anything, from fifty upwards."</p>

    <p>He picked up a few pieces of quartz from the canvas
    sheet.</p>

    <p>"Here is your walking-dress," he said, handing her a lump
    weighing about a pound. "With the balance in the heap there you
    can stagger the best-dressed woman you meet at your first
    dinner in England."</p>

    <p>"Do you mean by pelting her?" she inquired,
    mischievously.</p>

    <p>"Far worse. By wearing a more expensive costume."</p>

    <p>His manner was so earnest that he compelled seriousness.
    Iris took the proffered specimen and looked at it.</p>

    <p>"From the cave, I suppose? I thought you said antimony was
    not very valuable?"</p>

    <p>"That is not antimony. It is gold. By chance I have hit upon
    an extremely rich lode of gold. At the most modest computation
    it is worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. You and I are
    quite wealthy people, Miss Deane."</p>

    <p>Iris opened her blue eyes very wide at this intelligence. It
    took her breath away. But her first words betokened her innate
    sense of fair dealing.</p>

    <p>"You and I! Wealthy!" she gasped. "I am so glad for your
    sake, but tell me, pray, Mr. Jenks, what have <i>I</i> got to
    do with it?"</p>

    <p>"You!" he repeated. "Are we not partners in this island? By
    squatter's right, if by no better title, we own land, minerals,
    wood, game, and even such weird belongings as ancient lights
    and fishing privileges."</p>

    <p>"I don't see that at all. You find a gold mine, and coolly
    tell me that I am a half owner of it because you dragged me out
    of the sea, fed me, housed me, saved my life from pirates, and
    generally acted like a devoted nursemaid in charge of a baby.
    Really, Mr. Jenks&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Really, Miss Deane, you will annoy me seriously if you say
    another word. I absolutely refuse to listen to such an
    argument."</p>

    <p>Her outrageously unbusiness-like utterances, treading fast
    on the heels of his own melodramatic and written views
    concerning their property, nettled him greatly. Each downright
    syllable was a sting to his conscience, but of this Iris was
    blissfully unaware, else she would not have applied caustic to
    the rankling wound caused by his momentary distrust of her.</p>

    <p>For some time they stood in silence, until the sailor
    commenced to reproach himself for his rough protest. Perhaps he
    had hurt her sensitive feelings. What a brute he was, to be
    sure! She was only a child in ordinary affairs, and he ought to
    have explained things more lucidly and with greater command
    over his temper. And all this time Iris's face was dimpling
    with amusement, for she understood him so well that had he
    threatened to kill her she would have laughed at him.</p>

    <p>"Would you mind getting the lamp?" he said softly, surprised
    to catch her expression of saucy humor.</p>

    <p>"Oh, please may I speak?" she inquired. "I don't want to
    annoy you, but I am simply dying to talk."</p>

    <p>He had forgotten his own injunction.</p>

    <p>"Let us first examine our mine," he said. "If you bring the
    lamp we can have a good look at it."</p>

    <p>Close scrutiny of the work already done merely confirmed the
    accuracy of his first impressions. Whilst Iris held the light
    he opened up the seam with a few strokes of the pick. Each few
    inches it broadened into a noteworthy volcanic dyke, now yellow
    in its absolute purity, at times a bluish black when fused with
    other metals. The additional labor involved caused him to
    follow up the line of the fault. Suddenly the flame of the lamp
    began to flicker in a draught. There was an air-passage between
    cave and ledge.</p>

    <p>"I am sorry," cried Jenks, desisting from further efforts,
    "that I have not recently read one of Bret Harte's novels, or I
    would speak to you in the language of the mining camp. But in
    plain Cockney, Miss Deane, we are on to a good thing if only we
    can keep it."</p>

    <p>They came back into the external glare. Iris was now so
    serious that she forgot to extinguish the little lamp. She
    stood with outstretched hand.</p>

    <p>"There is a lot of money in there," she said.</p>

    <p>"Tons of it."</p>

    <p>"No need to quarrel about division. There is enough for both
    of us."</p>

    <p>"Quite enough. We can even spare some for our friends."</p>

    <p>He took so readily to this definition of their partnership
    that Iris suddenly became frigid. Then she saw the ridiculous
    gleam of the tiny wick and blew it out.</p>

    <p>"I mean," she said, stiffly, "that if you and I do agree to
    go shares we will each be very rich."</p>

    <p>"Exactly. I applied your words to the mine alone, of
    course."</p>

    <p>A slight thing will shatter a daydream. This sufficed. The
    sailor resumed his task of burying the stores.</p>

    <p>"Poor little lamp!" he thought. "When it came into the
    greater world how soon it was snuffed out."</p>

    <p>But Iris said to herself, "What a silly slip that was of
    mine! Enough for both of us, indeed! Does he expect me to
    propose to him? I wonder what the letter was about which he
    destroyed as I came back after my bath. It must have been meant
    for me. Why did he write it? Why did he tear it up?"</p>

    <p>The hour drew near when Jenks climbed to the Summit Rock. He
    shouldered axe and rifle and set forth. Iris heard him rustling
    upwards through the trees. She set some water to boil for tea,
    and, whilst bringing a fresh supply of fuel, passed the spot
    where the torn scraps of paper littered the sand.</p>

    <p>She was the soul of honor, for a woman, but there was never
    a woman yet who could take her eyes off a written document
    which confronted her. She could not help seeing that one small
    morsel contained her own name. Though mutilated it had clearly
    read&mdash;Miss Deane."</p>

    <p>"So it <i>was</i> intended for me!" she cried, throwing down
    her bundle and dropping to her knees. She secured that
    particular slip and examined it earnestly. Not for worlds would
    she pick up all the scraps and endeavor to sort them. Yet they
    had a fascination for her, and at this closer range she saw
    another which bore the legend&mdash;"I love you!"</p>

    <p>Somehow the two seemed to fit together very nicely.</p>

    <p>Yet a third carried the same words&mdash;"I love you!" They
    were still quite coherent. She did not want to look any
    further. She did not even turn over such of the torn pieces as
    had fluttered to earth face downwards.</p>

    <p>Opening the front of her bodice she brought to light a small
    gold locket containing miniatures of her father and mother.
    Inside this receptacle she carefully placed the three really
    material portions of the sailor's letter. When Jenks walked
    down the hill again he heard her singing long before he caught
    sight of her, sedulously tending the fire.</p>

    <p>As he came near he perceived the remains of his useless
    document. He stooped and gathered them up, forthwith throwing
    them among the glowing logs.</p>

    <p>"By the way, what were you writing whilst I had my bath?"
    inquired Iris, demurely.</p>

    <p>"Some information about the mine. On second thoughts,
    however, I saw it was unnecessary."</p>

    <p>"Oh, was that all?"</p>

    <p>"Practically all."</p>

    <p>"Then some part was impracticable?"</p>

    <p>He glanced sharply at her, but she was merely talking at
    random.</p>

    <p>"Well, you see," he explained, "one can do so little without
    the requisite plant. This sort of ore requires a crushing-mill,
    a smelting furnace, perhaps big tanks filled with cyanide of
    potassium."</p>

    <p>"And, of course, although you can do wonders, you cannot
    provide all those things, can you?"</p>

    <p>Jenks deemed this query to be unanswerable.</p>

    <p>They were busy again until night fell. Sitting down for a
    little while before retiring to rest, they discussed, for the
    hundredth time, the probabilities of speedy succor. This led
    them to the topic of available supplies, and the sailor told
    Iris the dispositions he had made.</p>

    <p>"Did you bury the box of books?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes, but not in the cave. They are at the foot of the
    cinchona over there. Why? Do you want any?"</p>

    <p>"I have a Bible in my room, but there was a Tennyson among
    the others which I glanced at in spare moments."</p>

    <p>The sailor thanked the darkness that concealed the deep
    bronze of face and neck caused by this chance remark. He
    vaguely recollected the manner in which the lines from "Maud"
    came to his lips after the episode of the letter. Was it
    possible that he had unknowingly uttered them aloud and Iris
    was now slily poking fun at him? He glowed with
    embarrassment.</p>

    <p>"It is odd that you should mention Tennyson," he managed to
    say calmly. "Only today I was thinking of a favorite
    passage."</p>

    <p>Iris, of course, was quite innocent this time.</p>

    <p>"Oh, do tell me. Was it from 'Enoch Arden'?"</p>

    <p>He gave a sigh of relief. "No. Anything but that," he
    answered.</p>

    <p>"What then?"</p>

    <p>"'Maud.'"</p>

    <p>"Oh, 'Maud.' It is very beautiful, but I could never imagine
    why the poet gave such a sad ending to an idyllic love
    story."</p>

    <p>"They too often end that way. Moreover, 'Enoch Arden' is not
    what you might call exhilarating."</p>

    <p>"No. It is sad. I have often thought he had the 'Sonata
    Path&eacute;tique' in his mind when he wrote it. But the note
    is mournful all through. There is no promise of happiness as in
    'Maud.'"</p>

    <p>"Then it is my turn to ask questions. Why did you hit upon
    that poem among so many?"</p>

    <p>"Because it contains an exact description of our position
    here. Don't you remember how the poor fellow</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"'Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,</p>

            <p>A shipwrecked sailor, waiting for a sail.'</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"I am sure Tennyson saw our island with poetic eye, for he
    goes on&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"'No sail from day to day, but every day</p>

            <p>The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts</p>

            <p>Among the palms and ferns and precipices;</p>

            <p>The blaze upon the waters to the east;</p>

            <p>The blaze upon his island overhead;</p>

            <p>The blaze upon the waters to the west;</p>

            <p>Then the great stars that globed themselves in
            Heaven,</p>

            <p>The scarlet shafts of sunrise&mdash;but no
            sail."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>She declaimed the melodious verse with a subtle skill that
    amazed her hearer. Profoundly moved, Jenks dared not trust
    himself to speak.</p>

    <p>"I read the whole poem the other day," she said after a
    silence of some minutes. "Sorrowful as it is, it comforted me
    by comparison. How different will be our fate to his when
    'another ship stays by this isle'!"</p>

    <p>Yet neither of them knew that one line she had recited was
    more singularly applicable to their case than that which they
    paid heed to. "The great stars that globed themselves in
    Heaven," were shining clear and bright in the vast arch above.
    Resplendent amidst the throng rose the Pleiades, the
    mythological seven hailed by the Greeks as an augury of safe
    navigation. And the Dyaks&mdash;one of the few remaining savage
    races of the world&mdash;share the superstition of the people
    who fashioned all the arts and most of the sciences.</p>

    <p>The Pleiades form the Dyak tutelary genius. Some among a
    bloodthirsty and vengeful horde were even then pointing to the
    clustering stars that promised quick voyage to the isle where
    their kinsmen had been struck down by a white man who rescued a
    maid. Nevertheless, Grecian romance and Dyak lore alike
    relegate the influence of the Pleiades to the sea. Other stars
    are needed to foster enterprise ashore.</p>

    <p>Night after night the Pleiades swung higher in the
    firmament; day after day the sailor perfected his defences and
    anxiously scanned the ocean for sign of friendly smoke or
    hostile sail. This respite would not have been given to him,
    were it not for the lucky bullet which removed two fingers and
    part of a third from the right hand of the Dyak chief. Not even
    a healthy savage can afford to treat such a wound lightly, and
    ten days elapsed before the maimed robber was able to move the
    injured limb without a curse.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, each night Jenks slept less soundly; each day his
    face became more careworn. He began to realize why the island
    had not been visited already by the vessel which would
    certainly be deputed to search for them&mdash;she was examining
    the great coast-line of China and Siam.</p>

    <p>It was his habit to mark the progress of time on the rudely
    made sun-dial which sufficiently served their requirements as a
    clock. Iris happened to watch him chipping the forty-fourth
    notch on the edge of the horizontal block of wood.</p>

    <p>"Have we really been forty-four days here?" she inquired,
    after counting the marks with growing astonishment.</p>

    <p>"I believe the reckoning is accurate," he said. "The
    <i>Sirdar</i> was lost on the 18th of March, and I make this
    the 1st of May."</p>

    <p>"May Day!"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Shall we drive to Hurlingham this afternoon?"</p>

    <p>"Looked at in that way it seems to be a tremendous time,
    though indeed, in some respects, it figures in my mind like
    many years. That is when I am thinking. Otherwise, when busy,
    the days fly like hours."</p>

    <p>"It must be convenient to have such an elastic scale."</p>

    <p>"Most useful. I strive to apply the quick rate when you are
    grumpy."</p>

    <p>Iris placed her arms akimbo, planted her feet widely apart,
    and surveyed Jenks with an expression that might almost be
    termed impudent. They were great friends, these two, now. The
    incipient stage of love-making had been dropped entirely, as
    ludicrously unsuited to their environment.</p>

    <p>When the urgent necessity for continuous labor no longer
    spurred them to exertion during every moment of daylight, they
    tackled the box of books and read, not volumes which appealed
    to them in common, but quaint tomes in the use of which Jenks
    was tutor and Iris the scholar.</p>

    <p>It became a fixed principle with the girl that she was very
    ignorant, and she insisted that the sailor should teach her.
    For instance, among the books he found a treatise on astronomy;
    it yielded a keen delight to both to identify a constellation
    and learn all sorts of wonderful things concerning it. But to
    work even the simplest problem required a knowledge of algebra,
    and Iris had never gone beyond decimals. So the stock of
    notebooks, instead of recording their experiences, became
    covered with symbols showing how x plus y equaled x&sup2; minus
    3,000,000.</p>

    <p>As a variant, Jenks introduced a study of Hindustani. His
    method was to write a short sentence and explain in detail its
    component parts. With a certain awe Iris surveyed the
    intricacies of the Urdu compound verb, but, about her fourth
    lesson, she broke out into exclamations of extravagant joy.</p>

    <p>"What on earth is the matter now?" demanded her surprised
    mentor.</p>

    <p>"Don't you see?" she exclaimed, delightedly. "Of course you
    don't! People who know a lot about a thing often miss its
    obvious points. I have discovered how to write Kiplingese. All
    you have to do is to tell your story in Urdu, translate it
    literally into English, and there you are!"</p>

    <p>"Quite so. Just do it as Kipling does, and the secret is
    laid bare. By the same rule you can hit upon the Miltonic
    adjective."</p>

    <p>Iris tossed her head.</p>

    <p>"I don't know anything about the Miltonic adjective, but I
    am sure about Kipling."</p>

    <p>This ended the argument. She knitted her brows in the effort
    to master the ridiculous complexities of a language which,
    instead of simply saying "Take" or "Bring," compels one to say
    "Take-go" and "Take-come."</p>

    <p>One problem defied solution&mdash;that of providing raiment
    for Iris. The united skill of the sailor and herself would not
    induce unraveled cordage to supply the need of thread. It was
    either too weak or too knotty, and meanwhile the girl's clothes
    were falling to pieces. Jenks tried the fibers of trees, the
    sinews of birds&mdash;every possible expedient he could hit
    upon&mdash;and perhaps, after experiments covering some weeks,
    he might have succeeded. But modern dress stuffs, weakened by
    aniline dyes and stiffened with Chinese clay, permit of no such
    exhaustive research. It must be remembered that the lady
    passengers on board the <i>Sirdar</i> were dressed to suit the
    tropics, and the hard usage given by Iris to her scanty stock
    was never contemplated by the Manchester or Bradford looms
    responsible for the durability of the material.</p>

    <p>As the days passed the position became irksome. It even
    threatened complete callapse during some critical moment, and
    the two often silently surveyed the large number of merely male
    garments in their possession. Of course, in the matter of coats
    and waistcoats there was no difficulty whatever. Iris had long
    been wearing those portions of the doctor's uniform. But when
    it came to the rest&mdash;</p>

    <p>At last, one memorable morning, she crossed the Rubicon.
    Jenks had climbed, as usual, to the Summit Rock. He came back
    with the exciting news that he thought&mdash;he could not be
    certain, but there were indications inspiring
    hopefulness&mdash;that towards the west of the far-off island
    he could discern the smoke of a steamer.</p>

    <p>Though he had eyes for a faint cloud of vapor at least fifty
    miles distant he saw nothing of a remarkable change effected
    nearer home. Outwardly, Iris was attired in her wonted manner,
    but if her companion's mind were not wholly monopolized by the
    bluish haze detected on the horizon, he must have noticed the
    turned-up ends of a pair of trousers beneath the hem of her
    tattered skirt.</p>

    <p>It did occur to him that Iris received his momentous
    announcement with an odd air of hauteur, and it was passing
    strange she did not offer to accompany him when, after bolting
    his breakfast, he returned to the observatory.</p>

    <p>He came back in an hour, and the lines on his face were
    deeper than before.</p>

    <p>"A false alarm," he said curtly in response to her
    questioning look.</p>

    <p>And that was all, though she nerved herself to walk steadily
    past him on her way to the well. This was disconcerting, even
    annoying to a positive young woman like Iris. Resolving to end
    the ordeal, she stood rigidly before him.</p>

    <p>"Well," she said, "I've done it!"</p>

    <p>"Have you?" he exclaimed, blankly.</p>

    <p>"Yes. They're a little too long, and I feel very awkward,
    but they're better than&mdash;than my poor old dress
    unsupported."</p>

    <p>She blushed furiously, to the sailor's complete
    bewilderment, but she bravely persevered and stretched out an
    unwilling foot.</p>

    <p>"Oh. I see!" he growled, and he too reddened.</p>

    <p>"I can't help it, can I?" she demanded piteously. "It is not
    unlike a riding-habit, is it?"</p>

    <p>Then his ready wit helped him.</p>

    <p>"An excellent compromise," he cried. "A process of
    evolution, in fact. Now, do you know, Miss Deane, that would
    never have occurred to me."</p>

    <p>And during the remainder of the day he did not once look at
    her feet. Indeed, he had far more serious matters to distract
    his thoughts, for Iris, feverishly anxious to be busy, suddenly
    suggested that it would be a good thing were she able to use a
    rifle if a fight at close quarters became necessary.</p>

    <p>The recoil of the Lee-Metford is so slight that any woman
    can manipulate the weapon with effect, provided she is not
    called upon to fire from a standing position, in which case the
    weight is liable to cause bad aiming. Though it came rather
    late in the day, Jenks caught at the idea. He accustomed her in
    the first instance to the use of blank cartridges. Then, when
    fairly proficient in holding and sighting&mdash;a child can
    learn how to refill the clip and eject each empty
    shell&mdash;she fired ten rounds of service ammunition. The
    target was a white circle on a rock at eighty yards, and those
    of the ten shots that missed the absolute mark would have made
    an enemy at the same distance extremely uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Iris was much pleased with her proficiency. "Now," she
    cried, "instead of being a hindrance to you I may be some help.
    In any case, the Dyaks will think there are two men to face,
    and they have good reason to fear one of us."</p>

    <p>Then a new light dawned upon Jenks.</p>

    <p>"Why did you not think of it before?" he demanded. "Don't
    you see, Miss Deane, the possibility suggested by your words? I
    am sorry to be compelled to speak plainly, but I feel sure that
    if those scoundrels do attack us in force it will be more to
    secure you than to avenge the loss of their fellow tribesmen.
    First and foremost, the sea-going Dyaks are pirates and
    marauders. They prowl about the coast looking not so much for a
    fight as for loot and women. Now, if they return, and
    apparently find two well-armed men awaiting them, with no
    prospect of plunder, there is a chance they may abandon the
    enterprise."</p>

    <p>Iris did not flinch from the topic. She well knew its grave
    importance.</p>

    <p>"In other words," she said, "I must be seen by them dressed
    only in male clothing?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, as a last resource, that is. I have some hope that
    they may not discover our whereabouts owing to the precautions
    we have adopted. Perched up there on the ledge we will be
    profoundly uncomfortable, but that will be nothing if it
    secures our safety."</p>

    <p>She did not reply at once. Then she said
    musingly&mdash;"Forty-four days! Surely there has been ample
    time to scour the China Sea from end to end in search of us? My
    father would never abandon hope until he had the most positive
    knowledge that the <i>Sirdar</i> was lost with all on
    board."</p>

    <p>The sailor, through long schooling, was prepared with an
    answer&mdash;"Each day makes the prospect of escape brighter.
    Though I was naturally disappointed this morning, I must state
    quite emphatically that our rescue may come any hour."</p>

    <p>Iris looked at him steadily.</p>

    <p>"You wear a solemn face for one who speaks so cheerfully,"
    she said.</p>

    <p>"You should not attach too great significance to
    appearances. The owl, a very stupid bird, is noted for its
    philosophical expression."</p>

    <p>"Then we will strive to find wisdom in words. Do you
    remember, Mr. Jenks, that soon after the wreck you told me we
    might have to remain here many months?"</p>

    <p>"That was a pardonable exaggeration."</p>

    <p>"No, no. It was the truth. You are seeking now to buoy me up
    with false hope. It is sixteen hundred miles from Hong Kong to
    Singapore, and half as much from Siam to Borneo. The
    <i>Sirdar</i> might have been driven anywhere in the typhoon.
    Didn't you say so, Mr. Jenks?"</p>

    <p>He wavered under this merciless cross-examination.</p>

    <p>"I had no idea your memory was so good," he said,
    weakly.</p>

    <p>"Excellent, I assure you. Moreover, during our forty-four
    days together, you have taught me to think. Why do you adopt
    subterfuge with me? We are partners in all else. Why cannot I
    share your despair as well as your toil?"</p>

    <p>She blazed out in sudden wrath, and he understood that she
    would not be denied the full extent of his secret fear. He
    bowed reverently before her, as a mortal paying homage to an
    angry goddess.</p>

    <p>"I can only admit that you are right," he murmured. "We must
    pray that God will direct our friends to this island. Otherwise
    we may not be found for a year, as unhappily the fishermen who
    once came here now avoid the place. They have been frightened
    by the contents of the hollow behind the cliff. I am glad you
    have solved the difficulty unaided, Miss Deane. I have striven
    at times to be coarse, even brutal, towards you, but my heart
    flinched from the task of telling you the possible period of
    your imprisonment."</p>

    <p>Then Iris, for the first time in many days, wept bitterly,
    and Jenks, blind to the true cause of her emotion, picked up a
    rifle to which, in spare moments, he had affixed a curious
    device, and walked slowly across Prospect Park towards the
    half-obliterated road leading to the Valley of Death.</p>

    <p>The girl watched him disappear among the trees. Through her
    tears shone a sorrowful little smile.</p>

    <p>"He thinks only of me, never of himself," she communed. "If
    it pleases Providence to spare us from these savages, what does
    it matter to me how long we remain here? I have never been so
    happy before in my life. I fear I never will be again. If it
    were not for my father's terrible anxiety I would not have a
    care in the world. I only wish to get away, so that one brave
    soul at least may be rid of needless tortures. All his worry is
    on my account, none on his own."</p>

    <p>That was what tearful Miss Iris thought, or tried to
    persuade herself to think. Perhaps her cogitations would not
    bear strict analysis. Perhaps she harbored a sweet hope that
    the future might yet contain bright hours for herself and the
    man who was so devoted to her. She refused to believe that
    Robert Anstruther, strong of arm and clear of brain, a Knight
    of the Round Table in all that was noble and chivalric, would
    permit his name to bear an unwarrantable stigma when&mdash;and
    she blushed like a June rose&mdash;he came to tell her that
    which he had written.</p>

    <p>The sailor returned hastily, with the manner of one hurrying
    to perform a neglected task. Without any explanation to Iris he
    climbed several times to the ledge, carrying arm-loads of grass
    roots which he planted in full view. Then he entered the cave,
    and, although he was furnished only with the dim light that
    penetrated through the distant exit, she heard him hewing
    manfully at the rock for a couple of hours. At last he emerged,
    grimy with dust and perspiration, just in time to pay a last
    visit to Summit Rock before the sun sank to rest. He asked the
    girl to delay somewhat the preparations for their evening meal,
    as he wished to take a bath, so it was quite dark when they sat
    down to eat.</p>

    <p>Iris had long recovered her usual state of high spirits.</p>

    <p>"Why were you burrowing in the cavern again?" she inquired.
    "Are you in a hurry to get rich?"</p>

    <p>"I was following an air-shaft, not a lode," he replied. "I
    am occasionally troubled with after wit, and this is an
    instance. Do you remember how the flame of the lamp flickered
    whilst we were opening up our mine?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"I was so absorbed in contemplating our prospective wealth
    that I failed to pay heed to the true significance of that
    incident. It meant the existence of an upward current of air.
    Now, where the current goes there must be a passage, and whilst
    I was busy this afternoon among the trees over there,"&mdash;he
    pointed towards the Valley of Death&mdash;"it came to me like
    an inspiration that possibly a few hours' hewing and delving
    might open a shaft to the ledge. I have been well rewarded for
    the effort. The stuff in the vault is so eaten away by water
    that it is no more solid than hard mud for the most part.
    Already I have scooped out a chimney twelve feet high."</p>

    <p>"What good can that be?"</p>

    <p>"At present we have only a front door&mdash;up the face of
    the rock. When my work is completed, before tomorrow night I
    hope, we shall have a back door also. Of course I may encounter
    unforeseen obstacles as I advance. A twist in the fault would
    be nearly fatal, but I am praying that it may continue straight
    to the ledge."</p>

    <p>"I still don't see the great advantage to us."</p>

    <p>"The advantages are many, believe me. The more points of
    attack presented by the enemy the more effective will be our
    resistance. I doubt if they would ever be able to rush the cave
    were we to hold it, whereas I can go up and down our back
    staircase whenever I choose. If you don't mind being left in
    the dark I will resume work now, by the light of your
    lamp."</p>

    <p>But Iris protested against this arrangement. She felt
    lonely. The long hours of silence had been distasteful to her.
    She wanted to talk.</p>

    <p>"I agree," said Jenks, "provided you do not pin me down to
    something I told you a month ago."</p>

    <p>"I promise. You can tell me as much or as little as you
    think fit. The subject for discussion is your
    court-martial."</p>

    <p>He could not see the tender light in her eyes, but the quiet
    sympathy of her voice restrained the protest prompt on his
    lips. Yet he blurted out, after a slight pause&mdash;</p>

    <p>"That is a very unsavory subject."</p>

    <p>"Is it? I do not think so. I am a friend, Mr. Jenks, not an
    old one, I admit, but during the past six weeks we have bridged
    an ordinary acquaintanceship of as many years. Can you not
    trust me?"</p>

    <p>Trust her? He laughed softly. Then, choosing his words with
    great deliberation, he answered&mdash;"Yes, I can trust you. I
    intended to tell you the story some day. Why not tonight?"</p>

    <p>Unseen in the darkness Iris's hand sought and clasped the
    gold locket suspended from her neck. She already knew some
    portion of the story he would tell. The remainder was of minor
    importance.</p>

    <p>"It is odd," he continued, "that you should have alluded to
    six years a moment ago. It is exactly six years, almost to a
    day, since the trouble began."</p>

    <p>"With Lord Ventnor?" The name slipped out involuntarily.</p>

    <p>"Yes. I was then a Staff Corps subaltern, and my proficiency
    in native languages attracted the attention of a friend in
    Simla, who advised me to apply for an appointment on the
    political side of the Government of India. I did so. He
    supported the application, and I was assured of the next
    vacancy in a native state, provided that I got married."</p>

    <p>He drawled out the concluding words with exasperating
    slowness. Iris, astounded by the stipulation, dropped her
    locket and leaned forward into the red light of the log fire.
    The sailor's quick eye caught the glitter of the ornament.</p>

    <p>"By the way," he interrupted, "what is that thing shining on
    your breast?"</p>

    <p>She instantly clasped the trinket again. "It is my sole
    remaining adornment," she said; "a present from my father on my
    tenth birthday. Pray go on!"</p>

    <p>"I was not a marrying man, Miss Deane, and the requisite
    qualification nearly staggered me. But I looked around the
    station, and came to the conclusion that the Commissioner's
    niece would make a suitable wife. I regarded her 'points,' so
    to speak, and they filled the bill. She was smart,
    good-looking, lively, understood the art of entertaining, was
    first-rate in sports and had excellent teeth. Indeed, if a man
    selected a wife as he does a horse, she&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Don't be horrid. Was she really pretty?"</p>

    <p>"I believe so. People said she was."</p>

    <p>"But what did <i>you</i> think?"</p>

    <p>"At the time my opinion was biased. I have seen her since,
    and she wears badly. She is married now, and after thirty grew
    very fat."</p>

    <p>Artful Jenks! Iris settled herself comfortably to
    listen.</p>

    <p>"I have jumped that fence with a lot in hand," he
    thought.</p>

    <p>"We became engaged," he said aloud.</p>

    <p>"She threw herself at him," communed Iris.</p>

    <p>"Her name was Elizabeth&mdash;Elizabeth Morris." The young
    lieutenant of those days called her "Bessie," but no
    matter.</p>

    <p>"Well, you didn't marry her, anyhow," commented Iris, a
    trifle sharply.</p>

    <p>And now the sailor was on level ground again.</p>

    <p>"Thank Heaven, no," he said, earnestly. "We had barely
    become engaged when she went with her uncle to Simla for the
    hot weather. There she met Lord Ventnor, who was on the
    Viceroy's staff, and&mdash;if you don't mind, we will skip a
    portion of the narrative&mdash;I discovered then why men in
    India usually go to England for their wives. Whilst in Simla on
    ten days' leave I had a foolish row with Lord Ventnor in the
    United Service Club&mdash;hammered him, in fact, in defence of
    a worthless woman, and was only saved from a severe reprimand
    because I had been badly treated. Nevertheless, my hopes of a
    political appointment vanished, and I returned to my regiment
    to learn, after due reflection, what a very lucky person I
    was."</p>

    <p>"Concerning Miss Morris, you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Exactly. And now exit Elizabeth. Not being cut out for
    matrimonial enterprise I tried to become a good officer. A year
    ago, when Government asked for volunteers to form Chinese
    regiments, I sent in my name and was accepted. I had the good
    fortune to serve under an old friend, Colonel Costobell; but
    some malign star sent Lord Ventnor to the Far East, this time
    in an important civil capacity. I met him occasionally, and we
    found we did not like each other any better. My horse beat his
    for the Pagoda Hurdle Handicap&mdash;poor old Sultan! I wonder
    where he is now."</p>

    <p>"Was your horse called 'Sultan'?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. I bought him in Meerut, trained him myself, and
    ferried him all the way to China. I loved him next to the
    British Army."</p>

    <p>This was quite satisfactory. There was genuine feeling in
    his voice now. Iris became even more interested.</p>

    <p>"Colonel Costobell fell ill, and the command of the regiment
    devolved upon me, our only major being absent in the interior.
    The Colonel's wife unhappily chose that moment to flirt, as
    people say, with Lord Ventnor. Not having learnt the
    advisability of minding my own business, I remonstrated with
    her, thus making her my deadly enemy. Lord Ventnor contrived an
    official mission to a neighboring town and detailed me for the
    military charge. I sent a junior officer. Then Mrs. Costobell
    and he deliberately concocted a plot to ruin me&mdash;he, for
    the sake of his old animosity&mdash;you remember that I had
    also crossed his path in Egypt&mdash;she, because she feared I
    would speak to her husband. On pretence of seeking my advice,
    she inveigled me at night into a deserted corner of the Club
    grounds at Hong Kong. Lord Ventnor appeared, and as the upshot
    of their vile statements, which created an immediate uproar,
    I&mdash;well, Miss Deane, I nearly killed him."</p>

    <p>Iris vividly recalled the anguish he betrayed when this
    topic was inadvertently broached one day early in their
    acquaintance. Now he was reciting his painful history with the
    air of a man far more concerned to be scrupulously accurate
    than aroused in his deepest passions by the memory of past
    wrongs. What had happened in the interim to blunt these bygone
    sufferings? Iris clasped her locket. She thought she knew.</p>

    <p>"The remainder may be told in a sentence," he said. "Of what
    avail were my frenzied statements against the definite proofs
    adduced by Lord Ventnor and his unfortunate ally? Even her
    husband believed her and became my bitter foe. Poor woman! I
    have it in my heart to pity her. Well, that is all. I am
    here!"</p>

    <p>"Can a man be ruined so easily?" murmured the girl, her
    exquisite tact leading her to avoid any direct expression of
    sympathy.</p>

    <p>"It seems so. But I have had my reward. If ever I meet Mrs.
    Costobell again I will thank her for a great service."</p>

    <p>Iris suddenly became confused. Her brow and neck tingled
    with a quick access of color.</p>

    <p>"Why do you say that?" she asked; and Jenks, who was rising,
    either did not hear, or pretended not to hear, the tremor in
    her tone.</p>

    <p>"Because you once told me you would never marry Lord
    Ventnor, and after what I have told you now I am quite sure you
    will not."</p>

    <p>"Ah, then you <i>do</i> trust me?" she almost whispered.</p>

    <p>He forced back the words trembling for utterance. He even
    strove weakly to assume an air of good-humored badinage.</p>

    <p>"See how you have tempted me from work, Miss Deane," he
    cried. "We have gossiped here until the fire grew tired of our
    company. To bed, please, at once."</p>

    <p>Iris caught him by the arm.</p>

    <p>"I will pray tonight, and every night," she said solemnly,
    "that your good name may be cleared in the eyes of all men as
    it is in mine. And I am sure my prayer will be answered."</p>

    <p>She passed into her chamber, but her angelic influence
    remained. In his very soul the man thanked God for the
    tribulation which brought this woman into his life. He had
    traversed the wilderness to find an oasis of rare beauty. What
    might lie beyond he neither knew nor cared. Through the
    remainder of his existence, be it a day or many a year, he
    would be glorified by the knowledge that in one incomparable
    heart he reigned supreme, unchallenged, if only for the hour.
    Fatigue, anxiety, bitter recollection and present danger, were
    overwhelmed and forgotten in the nearness, the intangible
    presence of Iris. He looked up to the starry vault, and,
    yielding to the spell, he, too, prayed.</p>

    <p>It was a beautiful night. After a baking hot day the rocks
    were radiating their stored-up heat, but the pleasant
    south-westerly breeze that generally set in at sunset tempered
    the atmosphere and made sleep refreshing. Jenks could not
    settle down to rest for a little while after Iris left him. She
    did not bring forth her lamp, and, unwilling to disturb her, he
    picked up a resinous branch, lit it in the dying fire, and went
    into the cave.</p>

    <p>He wanted to survey the work already done, and to determine
    whether it would be better to resume operations in the morning
    from inside the excavation or from the ledge. Owing to the
    difficulty of constructing a vertical upward shaft, and the
    danger of a sudden fall of heavy material, he decided in favor
    of the latter course, although it entailed lifting all the
    refuse out of the hole. To save time, therefore, he carried his
    mining tools into the open, placed in position the <i>cheval de
    frise</i> long since constructed for the defence of the
    entrance, and poured water over the remains of the fire.</p>

    <p>This was his final care each night before stretching his
    weary limbs on his couch of branches. It caused delay in the
    morning, but he neglected no precaution, and there was a
    possible chance of the Dyaks failing to discover the Eagle's
    Nest if they were persuaded by other indications that the
    island was deserted.</p>

    <p>He entered the hut and was in the act of pulling off his
    boots, when a distant shot rang sharply through the air. It was
    magnified tenfold by the intense silence. For a few seconds
    that seemed to be minutes he listened, cherishing the quick
    thought that perhaps a turtle, wandering far beyond accustomed
    limits, had disturbed one of the spring-gun communications on
    the sands. A sputtering volley, which his trained ear
    recognized as the firing of muzzle-loaders, sounded the
    death-knell of his last hope.</p>

    <p>The Dyaks had landed! Coming silently and mysteriously in
    the dead of night, they were themselves the victims of a
    stratagem they designed to employ. Instead of taking the
    occupants of Rainbow Island unawares they were startled at
    being greeted by a shot the moment they landed. The alarmed
    savages at once retaliated by firing their antiquated weapons
    point-blank at the trees, thus giving warning enough to wake
    the Seven Sleepers.</p>

    <p>Iris, fully dressed, was out in a moment.</p>

    <p>"They have come!" she whispered.</p>

    <p>"Yes," was the cheery answer, for Jenks face to face with
    danger was a very different man to Jenks wrestling with the
    insidious attacks of Cupid. "Up the ladder! Be lively! They
    will not be here for half an hour if they kick up such a row at
    the first difficulty. Still, we will take no risks. Cast down
    those spare lines when you reach the top and haul away when I
    say 'Ready!' You will find everything to hand up there."</p>

    <p>He held the bottom of the ladder to steady it for the girl's
    climb. Soon her voice fell, like a message from a
    star&mdash;</p>

    <p>"All right! Please join me soon!"</p>

    <p>The coiled-up ropes dropped along the face of the rock.
    Clothes, pick, hatchet, hammer, crowbars, and other useful odds
    and ends were swung away into the darkness, for the moon as yet
    did not illumine the crag. The sailor darted into Belle Vue
    Castle and kicked their leafy beds about the floor. Then he
    slung all the rifles, now five in number, over his shoulders,
    and mounted the rope-ladder, which, with the spare cords, he
    drew up and coiled with careful method.</p>

    <p>"By the way," he suddenly asked, "have you your
    sou'wester?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"And your Bible?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. It rests beneath my head every night. I even brought
    our Tennyson."</p>

    <p>"Ah," he growled fiercely, "this is where the reality
    differs from the romance. Our troubles are only beginning
    now."</p>

    <p>"They will end the sooner. For my part, I have utter faith
    in you. If it be God's will, we will escape; and no man is more
    worthy than you to be His agent."</p>
    <hr>
    <a name="CHAPTER_XI"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

    <h2>THE FIGHT</h2>

    <p>The sailor knew so accurately the position of his reliable
    sentinels that he could follow each phase of the imaginary
    conflict on the other side of the island. The first outbreak of
    desultory firing died away amidst a chorus of protest from
    every feathered inhabitant of the isle, so Jenks assumed that
    the Dyaks had gathered again on the beach after riddling the
    scarecrows with bullets or slashing them with their heavy
    razor-edged parangs, Malay swords with which experts can fell a
    stout sapling at a single blow.</p>

    <p>A hasty council was probably held, and, notwithstanding
    their fear of the silent company in the hollow, an advance was
    ultimately made along the beach. Within a few yards they
    encountered the invisible cord of the third spring-gun. There
    was a report, and another fierce outbreak of musketry. This was
    enough. Not a man would move a step nearer that abode of the
    dead. The next commotion arose on the ridge near the North
    Cape.</p>

    <p>"At this rate of progress," said Jenks to the girl, "they
    will not reach our house until daylight."</p>

    <p>"I almost wish they were here," was the quiet reply. "I find
    this waiting and listening to be trying to the nerves."</p>

    <p>They were lying on a number of ragged garments hastily
    spread on the ledge, and peering intently into the moonlit area
    of Prospect Park. The great rock itself was shrouded in somber
    shadows. Even if they stood up none could see them from the
    ground, so dense was the darkness enveloping them.</p>

    <p>He turned slightly and took her hand. It was cool and moist.
    It no more trembled than his own.</p>

    <p>"The Dyaks are far more scared than you," he murmured with a
    laugh. "Cruel and courageous as they are, they dare not face a
    spook."</p>

    <p>"Then what a pity it is we cannot conjure up a ghost for
    their benefit! All the spirits I have ever read about were
    ridiculous. Why cannot one be useful occasionally?"</p>

    <p>The question set him thinking. Unknown to the girl, the
    materials for a dramatic apparition were hidden amidst the
    bushes near the well. He cudgeled his brains to remember the
    stage effects of juvenile days; but these needed limelight,
    blue flares, mirrors, phosphorus.</p>

    <p>The absurdity of hoping to devise any such accessories
    whilst perched on a ledge in a remote island&mdash;a larger
    reef of the thousands in the China Sea&mdash;tickled him.</p>

    <p>"What is it?" asked Iris.</p>

    <p>He repeated his list of missing stage properties. They had
    nothing to do but to wait, and people in the very crux and
    maelstrom of existence usually discuss trivial things.</p>

    <p>"I don't know anything about phosphorus," said the girl,
    "but you can obtain queer results from sulphur, and there is an
    old box of Norwegian matches resting at this moment on the
    shelf in my room. Don't you remember? They were in your pocket,
    and you were going to throw them away. Why, what are you
    doing?"</p>

    <p>For Jenks had cast the rope-ladder loose and was evidently
    about to descend.</p>

    <p>"Have no fear," he said; "I will not be away five
    minutes."</p>

    <p>"If you are going down I must come with you. I will not be
    left here alone."</p>

    <p>"Please do not stop me," he whispered earnestly. "You must
    not come. I will take no risk whatever. If you remain here you
    can warn me instantly. With both of us on the ground we will
    incur real danger. I want you to keep a sharp lookout towards
    Turtle Beach in case the Dyaks come that way. Those who are
    crossing the island will not reach us for a long time."</p>

    <p>She yielded, though unwillingly. She was tremulous with
    anxiety on his account.</p>

    <p>He vanished without another word. She next saw him in the
    moonlight near the well. He was rustling among the shrubs, and
    he returned to the rock with something white in his arms, which
    he seemingly deposited at the mouth of the cave. He went back
    to the well and carried another similar burthen. Then he ran
    towards the house. The doorway was not visible from the ledge,
    and she passed a few horrible moments until a low hiss beneath
    caught her ear. She could tell by the creak of the rope-ladder
    that he was ascending. At last he reached her side, and she
    murmured, with a gasping sob&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Don't go away again. I cannot stand it."</p>

    <p>He thought it best to soothe her agitation by arousing
    interest. Still hauling in the ladder with one hand, he held
    out the other, on which luminous wisps were writhing like
    glow-worms' ghosts.</p>

    <p>"You are responsible," he said. "You gave me an excellent
    idea, and I was obliged to carry it out."</p>

    <p>"What have you done?"</p>

    <p>"Arranged a fearsome bogey in the cave."</p>

    <p>"But how?"</p>

    <p>"It was not exactly a pleasant operation, but the only laws
    of necessity are those which must be broken."</p>

    <p>She understood that he did not wish her to question him
    further. Perhaps curiosity, now that he was safe, might have
    vanquished her terror, and led to another demand for
    enlightenment, but at that instant the sound of an angry voice
    and the crunching of coral away to the left drove all else from
    her mind.</p>

    <p>"They are coming by way of the beach, after all," whispered
    Jenks.</p>

    <p>He was mistaken, in a sense. Another outburst of
    intermittent firing among the trees on the north of the ridge
    showed that some, at least, of the Dyaks were advancing by
    their former route. The appearance of the Dyak chief on the
    flat belt of shingle, with his right arm slung across his
    breast, accompanied by not more than half a dozen followers,
    showed that a few hardy spirits had dared to pass the Valley of
    Death with all its nameless terrors.</p>

    <p>They advanced cautiously enough, as though dreading a
    surprise. The chief carried a bright parang in his left hand;
    the others were armed with guns, their swords being thrust
    through belts. Creeping forward on tip-toe, though their
    distant companions were making a tremendous row, they looked a
    murderous gang as they peered across the open space, now
    brilliantly illuminated by the moon.</p>

    <p>Jenks had a sudden intuition that the right thing to do now
    was to shoot the whole party. He dismissed the thought at once.
    All his preparations were governed by the hope that the pirates
    might abandon their quest after hours of fruitless search. It
    would be most unwise, he told himself, to precipitate
    hostilities. Far better avoid a conflict altogether, if that
    were possible, than risk the immediate discovery of his
    inaccessible retreat.</p>

    <p>In other words he made a grave mistake, which shows how a
    man may err when over-agonized by the danger of the woman he
    loves. The bold course was the right one. By killing the Dyak
    leader he would have deprived the enemy of the dominating
    influence in this campaign of revenge. When the main body,
    already much perturbed by the unseen and intangible agencies
    which opened fire at them in the wood, arrived in Prospect Park
    to find only the dead bodies of their chief and his small
    force, their consternation could be turned into mad panic by a
    vigorous bombardment from the rock.</p>

    <p>Probably, in less than an hour after their landing, the
    whole tribe would have rushed pell-mell to the boats, cursing
    the folly which led them to this devil-haunted island. But it
    serves no good purpose to say what might have been. As it was
    the Dyaks, silent now and moving with the utmost caution,
    passed the well, and were about to approach the cave when one
    of them saw the house.</p>

    <p>Instantly they changed their tactics. Retreating hastily to
    the shade of the opposite cliff they seemed to await the coming
    of reinforcements. The sailor fancied that a messenger was
    dispatched by way of the north sands to hurry up the laggards,
    because the distant firing slackened, and, five minutes later,
    a fierce outbreak of yells among the trees to the right
    heralded a combined rush on the Belle Vue Castle.</p>

    <p>The noise made by the savages was so great&mdash;the screams
    of bewildered birds circling overhead so incessant&mdash;that
    Jenks was compelled to speak quite loudly when he said to
    Iris&mdash;</p>

    <p>"They must think we sleep soundly not to be disturbed by the
    volleys they have fired already."</p>

    <p>She would have answered, but he placed a restraining hand on
    her shoulder, for the Dyaks quickly discovering that the hut
    was empty, ran towards the cave and thus came in full view.</p>

    <p>As well as Jenks could judge, the foremost trio of the
    yelping horde were impaled on the bayonets of the <i>cheval de
    frise</i>, learning too late its formidable nature. The wounded
    men shrieked in agony, but their cries were drowned in a
    torrent of amazed shouts from their companions. Forthwith there
    was a stampede towards the well, the cliff, the beaches,
    anywhere to get away from that awesome cavern where ghosts
    dwelt and men fell maimed at the very threshold. The sailor,
    leaning as far over the edge of the rock as the girl's
    expostulations would permit, heard a couple of men groaning
    beneath, whilst a third limped away with frantic and painful
    haste.</p>

    <p>"What is it?" whispered Iris, eager herself to witness the
    tumult. "What has happened?"</p>

    <p>"They have been routed by a box of matches and a few dried
    bones," he answered.</p>

    <p>There was no time for further speech. He was absorbed in
    estimating the probable number of the Dyaks. Thus far, he had
    seen about fifty. Moreover, he did not wish to acquaint Iris
    with the actual details of the artifice that had been so
    potent. Her allusion to the box of water-sodden
    T&auml;ndstickors gave him the notion of utilizing as an active
    ally the bleached remains of the poor fellow who had long ago
    fallen a victim to this identical mob of cut-throats or their
    associates. He gathered the principal bones from their
    resting-place near the well, rubbed them with the ends of the
    matches after damping the sulphur again, and arranged them with
    ghastly effect on the pile of rubbish at the further end of the
    cave, creeping under the <i>cheval de frise</i> for the
    purpose.</p>

    <p>Though not so vivid as he wished, the pale-glimmering
    headless skeleton in the intense darkness of the interior was
    appalling enough in all conscience. Fortunately the fumes of
    the sulphur fed on the bony substance. They endured a
    sufficient time to scare every Dyak who caught a glimpse of the
    monstrous object crouching in luminous horror within the dismal
    cavern.</p>

    <p>Not even the stirring exhortations of the chief, whose voice
    was raised in furious speech, could induce his adherents to
    again approach that affrighting spot. At last the daring
    scoundrel himself, still wielding his naked sword, strode right
    up to the very doorway. Stricken with sudden stupor, he gazed
    at the fitful gleams within. He prodded the <i>cheval de
    frise</i> with the parang. Here was something definite and
    solid. Then he dragged one of the wounded men out into the
    moonlight.</p>

    <p>Again Jenks experienced an itching desire to send a bullet
    through the Dyak's head; again he resisted the impulse. And so
    passed that which is vouchsafed by Fate to few men&mdash;a
    second opportunity.</p>

    <p>Another vehement harangue by the chief goaded some
    venturesome spirits into carrying their wounded comrade out of
    sight, presumably to the hut. Inspired by their leader's
    fearless example, they even removed the third injured Dyak from
    the vicinity of the cave, but the celerity of their retreat
    caused the wretch to bawl in agony.</p>

    <p>Their next undertaking was no sooner appreciated by the
    sailor than he hurriedly caused Iris to shelter herself beneath
    the tarpaulin, whilst he cowered close to the floor of the
    ledge, looking only through the screen of tall grasses. They
    kindled a fire near the well. Soon its ruddy glare lit up the
    dark rock with fantastic flickerings, and drew scintillations
    from the weapons and ornaments of the hideously picturesque
    horde gathered in its vicinity.</p>

    <p>They spoke a language of hard vowels and nasal resonance,
    and ate what he judged to be dry fish, millets, and strips of
    tough preserved meat, which they cooked on small iron skewers
    stuck among the glowing embers. His heart sank as he counted
    sixty-one, all told, assembled within forty yards of the ledge.
    Probably several others were guarding the boats or prowling
    about the island. Indeed, events proved that more than eighty
    men had come ashore in three large sampans, roomy and fleet
    craft, well fitted for piratical excursions up river estuaries
    or along a coast.</p>

    <p>They were mostly bare-legged rascals, wearing Malay hats,
    loose jackets reaching to the knee, and sandals. One man
    differed essentially from the others. He was habited in the
    conventional attire of an Indian Mahommedan, and his skin was
    brown, whilst the swarthy Dyaks were yellow beneath the dirt.
    Jenks thought, from the manner in which his turban was tied,
    that he must be a Punjabi Mussulman&mdash;very likely an
    escaped convict from the Andamans.</p>

    <p>The most careful scrutiny did not reveal any arms of
    precision. They all carried muzzle-loaders, either antiquated
    flintlocks, or guns sufficiently modern to be fitted with
    nipples for percussion caps.</p>

    <p>Each Dyak, of course, sported a parang and dagger-like
    kriss; a few bore spears, and about a dozen shouldered a long
    straight piece of bamboo. The nature of this implement the
    sailor could not determine at the moment. When the knowledge
    did come, it came so rapidly that he was saved from many
    earlier hours of abiding; dread, for one of those
    innocuous-looking weapons was fraught with more quiet
    deadliness than a Gatling gun.</p>

    <p>In the neighborhood of the fire an animated discussion took
    place. Though it was easy to see that the chief was
    all-paramount, his fellow-tribesmen exercised a democratic
    right of free speech and outspoken opinion.</p>

    <p>Flashing eyes and expressive hands were turned towards cave
    and hut. Once, when the debate grew warm, the chief snatched up
    a burning branch and held it over the blackened embers of the
    fire extinguished by Jenks. He seemed to draw some definite
    conclusion from an examination of the charcoal, and the
    argument thenceforth proceeded with less emphasis. Whatever it
    was that he said evidently carried conviction.</p>

    <p>Iris, nestling close to the sailor, whispered&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Do you know what he has found out?"</p>

    <p>"I can only guess that he can tell by the appearance of the
    burnt wood how long it is since it was extinguished. Clearly
    they agree with him."</p>

    <p>"Then they know we are still here?"</p>

    <p>"Either here or gone within a few hours. In any case they
    will make a thorough search of the island at daybreak."</p>

    <p>"Will it be dawn soon?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Are you tired?"</p>

    <p>"A little cramped&mdash;that is all."</p>

    <p>"Don't think I am foolish&mdash;can you manage to
    sleep?"</p>

    <p>"Sleep! With those men so near!"</p>

    <p>"Yes. We do not know how long they will remain. We must keep
    up our strength. Sleep, next to food and drink, is a prime
    necessity."</p>

    <p>"If it will please you, I will try," she said, with such
    sweet readiness to obey his slightest wish that the wonder is
    he did not kiss her then and there. By previous instruction she
    knew exactly what to do. She crept quietly back until well
    ensconced in the niche widened and hollowed for her
    accommodation. There, so secluded was she from the outer world
    of horror and peril, that the coarse voices beneath only
    reached her in a murmur. Pulling one end of the tarpaulin over
    her, she stretched her weary limbs on a litter of twigs and
    leaves, commended herself and the man she loved to God's
    keeping, and, wonderful though it may seem, was soon slumbering
    peacefully.</p>

    <p>The statement may sound passing strange to civilized ears,
    accustomed only to the routine of daily life and not inured to
    danger and wild surroundings. But the soldier who has snatched
    a hasty doze in the trenches, the sailor who has heard a fierce
    gale buffeting the walls of his frail ark, can appreciate the
    reason why Iris, weary and surfeited with excitement, would
    have slept were she certain that the next sunrise would mark
    her last hour on earth.</p>

    <p>Jenks, too, composed himself for a brief rest. He felt
    assured that there was not the remotest chance of their lofty
    perch being found out before daybreak, and the first faint
    streaks of dawn would awaken him.</p>

    <p>These two, remote, abandoned, hopelessly environed by a
    savage enemy, closed their eyes contentedly and awaited that
    which the coming day should bring forth.</p>

    <p>When the morning breeze swept over the ocean and the stars
    were beginning to pale before the pink glory flung broadcast
    through the sky by the yet invisible sun, the sailor was
    aroused by the quiet fluttering of a bird about to settle on
    the rock, but startled by the sight of him.</p>

    <p>His faculties were at once on the alert, though he little
    realized the danger betokened by the bird's rapid dart into the
    void. Turning first to peer at Iris, he satisfied himself that
    she was still asleep. Her lips were slightly parted in a smile;
    she might be dreaming of summer and England. He noiselessly
    wormed his way to the verge of the rock and looked down through
    the grass-roots.</p>

    <p>The Dyaks were already stirring. Some were replenishing the
    fire, others were drawing water, cooking, eating, smoking long
    thin-stemmed pipes with absurdly small bowls, or oiling their
    limbs and weapons with impartial energy. The chief yet lay
    stretched on the sand, but, when the first beams of the sun
    gilded the waters, a man stooped over the prostrate form and
    said something that caused the sleeper to rise stiffly,
    supporting himself on his uninjured arm. They at once went off
    together towards Europa Point.</p>

    <p>"They have found the boat," thought Jenks. "Well, they are
    welcome to all the information it affords."</p>

    <p>The pair soon returned. Another Dyak advanced to exhibit one
    of Jenks's spring-gun attachments. The savages had a sense of
    humor. Several laughed heartily when the cause of their
    overnight alarms was revealed. The chief alone preserved a
    gloomy and saturnine expression.</p>

    <p>He gave some order at which they all hung back sheepishly.
    Cursing them in choice Malay, the chief seized a thick faggot
    and strode in the direction of the cave. Goaded into activity
    by his truculent demeanor, some followed him, and
    Jenks&mdash;unable to see, but listening anxiously&mdash;knew
    that they were tearing the <i>cheval de frise</i> from its
    supports. Nevertheless none of the working party entered the
    excavation. They feared the parched bones that shone by
    night.</p>

    <p>"Poor J.S.!" murmured the sailor. "If his spirit still
    lingers near the scene of his murder he will thank me for
    dragging him into the fray. He fought them living and he can
    scare them dead."</p>

    <p>As he had not been able to complete the communicating shaft
    it was not now of vital importance should the Dyaks penetrate
    to the interior. Yet he thanked the good luck that had showered
    such a heap of rubbish over the spot containing his chief
    stores and covering the vein of gold. Wild as these fellows
    were, they well knew the value of the precious metal, and if by
    chance they lighted upon such a well-defined lode they might
    not quit the island for weeks.</p>

    <p>At last, on a command from the chief, the Dyaks scattered in
    various directions. Some turned towards Europa Point, but the
    majority went to the east along Turtle Beach or by way of the
    lagoon. Prospect Park was deserted. They were scouring both
    sections of the island in full force.</p>

    <p>The quiet watcher on the ledge took no needless risks.
    Though it was impossible to believe any stratagem had been
    planned for his special benefit an accident might betray him.
    With the utmost circumspection he rose on all fours and with
    comprehensive glance examined trees, plateau, and both strips
    of beach for signs of a lurking foe. He need have no fear. Of
    all places in the island the Dyaks least imagined that their
    quarry had lain all night within earshot of their
    encampment.</p>

    <p>At this hour, when the day had finally conquered the night,
    and the placid sea offered a turquoise path to the infinite,
    the scene was restful, gently bewitching. He knew that, away
    there to the north, P. and O. steamers, Messageries Maritimes,
    and North German Lloyd liners were steadily churning the blue
    depths <i>en route</i> to Japan or the Straits Settlements.
    They carried hundreds of European passengers, men and women,
    even little children, who were far removed from the knowledge
    that tragedies such as this Dyak horror lay almost in their
    path. People in London were just going to the theater. He
    recalled the familiar jingle of the hansoms scampering along
    Piccadilly, the more stately pace of the private carriages
    crossing the Park. Was it possible that in the world of
    today&mdash;the world of telegraphs and express trains, of the
    newspaper and the motor car&mdash;two inoffensive human beings
    could be done to death so shamefully and openly as would be the
    fate of Iris and himself if they fell into the hands of these
    savages! It was inconceivable, intolerable! But it was
    true!</p>

    <p>And then, by an odd trick of memory, his mind reverted, not
    to the Yorkshire manor he learnt to love as a boy, but to a
    little French inland town where he once passed a summer holiday
    intent on improving his knowledge of the language. Interior
    France is even more remote, more secluded, more provincial,
    than agricultural England. There no breath of the outer world
    intrudes. All is laborious, circumspect, a trifle
    poverty-stricken, but beautified by an Arcadian simplicity. Yet
    one memorable day, when walking by the banks of a river, he
    came upon three men dragging from out a pool the water-soaked
    body of a young girl into whose fair forehead the blunt knob
    often seen on the back of an old-fashioned axe had been driven
    with cruel force. So, even in that tiny old-world hamlet,
    murder and lust could stalk hand in hand.</p>

    <p>He shuddered. Why did such a hateful vision trouble him?
    Resolutely banning the raven-winged specter, he slid back down
    the ledge and gently wakened Iris. She sat up instantly and
    gazed at him with wondering eyes.</p>

    <p>Fearful lest she should forget her surroundings, he placed a
    warning finger on his lips.</p>

    <p>"Oh," she said in a whisper, "are they still here?"</p>

    <p>He told her what had happened, and suggested that they
    should have something to eat whilst the coast was clear
    beneath. She needed no second bidding, for the long vigil of
    the previous night had made her very hungry, and the two
    breakfasted right royally on biscuit, cold fowl, ham, and good
    water.</p>

    <p>In this, the inner section of their refuge, they could be
    seen only by a bird or by a man standing on the distant rocky
    shelf that formed the southern extremity of the opposite cliff,
    and the sailor kept a close lookout in that direction.</p>

    <p>Iris was about to throw the remains of the feast into an
    empty oil-tin provided for refuse when Jenks restrained
    her.</p>

    <p>"No," he said, smilingly. "Scraps should be the first course
    next time. We must not waste an atom of food."</p>

    <p>"How thoughtless of me!" she exclaimed. "Please tell me you
    think they will go away today."</p>

    <p>But the sailor flung himself flat on the ledge and grasped a
    Lee-Metford.</p>

    <p>"Be still, on your life," he said. "Squeeze into your
    corner. There is a Dyak on the opposite cliff."</p>

    <p>True enough, a man had climbed to that unhappily placed
    rocky table, and was shouting something to a confr&egrave;re
    high on the cliff over their heads. As yet he had not seen
    them, nor even noticed the place where they were concealed. The
    sailor imagined, from the Dyak's gestures, that he was
    communicating the uselessness of further search on the western
    part of the island.</p>

    <p>When the conversation ceased, he hoped the loud-voiced
    savage would descend. But no! The scout looked into the valley,
    at the well, the house, the cave. Still he did not see the
    ledge. At that unlucky moment three birds, driven from the
    trees on the crest by the passage of the Dyaks, flew down the
    face of the cliff and began a circling quest for some safe
    perch on which to alight.</p>

    <p>Jenks swore with an emphasis not the less earnest because it
    was mute, and took steady aim at the Dyak's left breast. The
    birds fluttered about in ever smaller circles. Then one of them
    dropped easily on to the lip of the rock. Instantly his bright
    eyes encountered those of the man, and he darted off with a
    scream that brought his mates after him.</p>

    <p>The Dyak evidently noted the behavior of the birds&mdash;his
    only lore was the reading of such signs&mdash;and gazed
    intently at the ledge. Jenks he could not distinguish behind
    the screen of grass. He might perhaps see some portion of the
    tarpaulin covering the stores, but at the distance it must
    resemble a weather-beaten segment of the cliff. Yet something
    puzzled him. After a steady scrutiny he turned and yelled to
    others on the beach.</p>

    <p>The crucial moment had arrived. Jenks pressed the trigger,
    and the Dyak hurtled through the air, falling headlong out of
    sight.</p>

    <p>The sound of this, the first shot of real warfare, awoke
    Rainbow Island into tremendous activity. The winged life of the
    place filled the air with raucous cries, whilst shouting Dyaks
    scurried in all directions. Several came into the valley. Those
    nearest the fallen man picked him up and carried him to the
    well. He was quite dead, and, although amidst his other
    injuries they soon found the bullet wound, they evidently did
    not know whence the shot came, for those to whom he shouted had
    no inkling of his motive, and the slight haze from the rifle
    was instantly swept away by the breeze.</p>

    <p>Iris could hear the turmoil beneath, and she tremulously
    asked&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Are they going to attack us?"</p>

    <p>"Not yet," was the reassuring answer. "I killed the fellow
    who saw us before he could tell the others."</p>

    <p>It was a bold risk, and he had taken it, though, now the
    Dyaks knew for certain their prey had not escaped, there was no
    prospect of their speedy departure. Nevertheless the position
    was not utterly hopeless. None of the enemy could tell how or
    by whom their companion had been shot. Many among the excited
    horde jabbering beneath actually looked at the cliff over and
    over again, yet failed to note the potentialities of the ledge,
    with its few tufts of grass growing where seeds had apparently
    been blown by the wind or dropped by passing birds.</p>

    <p>Jenks understood, of course, that the real danger would
    arise when they visited the scene of their comrade's disaster.
    Even then the wavering balance of chance might cast the issue
    in his favor. He could only wait, with ready rifle, with the
    light of battle lowering in his eyes. Of one thing at least he
    was certain&mdash;before they conquered him he would levy a
    terrible toll.</p>

    <p>He glanced back at Iris. Her face was pale beneath its mask
    of sunbrown. She was bent over her Bible, and Jenks did not
    know that she was reading the 91st Psalm. Her lips
    murmured&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I will say unto the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress;
    my God, in Him will I trust."</p>

    <p>The chief was listening intently to the story of the Dyak
    who saw the dead man totter and fall. He gave some quick order.
    Followed by a score or more of his men he walked rapidly to the
    foot of the cliff where they found the lifeless body.</p>

    <p>And Iris read&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for
    the arrow that flieth by day."</p>

    <p>Jenks stole one more hasty glance at her. The chief and the
    greater number of his followers were out of sight behind the
    rocks. Some of them must now be climbing to that fatal ledge.
    Was this the end?</p>

    <p>Yet the girl, unconscious of the doom impending, kept her
    eyes steadfastly fixed on the book.</p>

    <p>"For He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee
    in all thy ways.</p>

    <p>"They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy
    foot against a stone....</p>

    <p>"He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be
    with him in trouble: I will deliver him and honour him."</p>

    <p>Iris did not apply the consoling words to herself. She
    closed the book and bent forward sufficiently in her sheltering
    niche to permit her to gaze with wistful tenderness upon the
    man whom she hoped to see delivered and honored. She knew he
    would dare all for her sake. She could only pray and hope.
    After reading those inspired verses she placed implicit trust
    in the promise made. For He was good: His was the mercy that
    "endureth forever." Enemies encompassed them with words of
    hatred&mdash;fought against them without a cause&mdash;but
    there was One who should "judge among the heathen" and "fill
    the places with dead bodies."</p>

    <p>Suddenly a clamor of discordant yells fell upon her ears.
    Jenks rose to his knees. The Dyaks had discovered their refuge
    and were about to open fire. He offered them a target lest
    perchance Iris were not thoroughly screened.</p>

    <p>"Keep close," he said. "They have found us. Lead will be
    flying around soon."</p>

    <p>She flinched back into the crevice; the sailor fell prone.
    Four bullets spat into the ledge, of which three pierced the
    tarpaulin and one flattened itself against the rock.</p>

    <p>Then Jenks took up the tale. So curiously constituted was
    this man, that although he ruthlessly shot the savage who first
    spied out their retreat, he was swayed only by the dictates of
    stern necessity. There was a feeble chance that further
    bloodshed might be averted. That chance had passed. Very well.
    The enemy must start the dreadful game about to be played. They
    had thrown the gage and he answered them. Four times did the
    Lee-Metford carry death, unseen, almost unfelt, across the
    valley.</p>

    <p>Ere the fourth Dyak collapsed limply where he stood, others
    were there, firing at the little puff of smoke above the grass.
    They got in a few shots, most of which sprayed at various
    angles off the face of the cliff. But they waited for no more.
    When the lever of the Lee-Metford was shoved home for the fifth
    time the opposing crest was bare of all opponents save two, and
    they lay motionless.</p>

    <p>The fate of the flanking detachment was either unperceived
    or unheeded by the Dyaks left in the vicinity of the house and
    well. Astounded by the firing that burst forth in mid-air,
    Jenks had cleared the dangerous rock before they realized that
    here, above their heads, were the white man and the maid whom
    they sought.</p>

    <p>With stupid zeal they blazed away furiously, only succeeding
    in showering fragments of splintered stone into the Eagle's
    Nest. And the sailor smiled. He quietly picked up an old coat,
    rolled it into a ball and pushed it into sight amidst the
    grass. Then he squirmed round on his stomach and took up a
    position ten feet away. Of course those who still carried
    loaded guns discharged them at the bundle of rags, whereupon
    Jenks thrust his rifle beyond the edge of the rock and leaned
    over.</p>

    <p>Three Dyaks fell before the remainder made up their minds to
    run. Once convinced, however, that running was good for their
    health, they moved with much celerity. The remaining cartridges
    in the magazine slackened the pace of two of their number.
    Jenks dropped the empty weapon and seized another. He stood up
    now and sent a quick reminder after the rearmost pirate. The
    others had disappeared towards the locality where their leader
    and his diminished troupe were gathered, not daring to again
    come within range of the whistling Dum-dums. The sailor,
    holding his rifle as though pheasant-shooting, bent forward and
    sought a belated opponent, but in vain. In military phrase, the
    <i>terrain</i> was clear of the enemy. There was no sound save
    the wailing of birds, the soft sough of the sea, and the
    yelling of the three wounded men in the house, who knew not
    what terrors threatened, and vainly bawled for succor.</p>

    <p>Again Jenks could look at Iris. Her face was bleeding. The
    sight maddened him.</p>

    <p>"My God!" he groaned, "are you wounded?"</p>

    <p>She smiled bravely at him.</p>

    <p>"It is nothing," she said. "A mere splash from the rock
    which cut my forehead."</p>

    <p>He dared not go to her. He could only hope that it was no
    worse, so he turned to examine the valley once more for vestige
    of a living foe.</p>
    <hr>
    <a name="CHAPTER_XII"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

    <h2>A TRUCE</h2>

    <p>Though his eyes, like live coals, glowered with sullen fire
    at the strip of sand and the rocks in front, his troubled brain
    paid perfunctory heed to his task. The stern sense of duty, the
    ingrained force of long years of military discipline and
    soldierly thought, compelled him to keep watch and ward over
    his fortress, but he could not help asking himself what would
    happen if Iris were seriously wounded.</p>

    <p>There was one enemy more potent than these skulking Dyaks, a
    foe more irresistible in his might, more pitiless in his
    strength, whose assaults would tax to the utmost their powers
    of resistance. In another hour the sun would be high in the
    heavens, pouring his ardent rays upon them and drying the blood
    in their veins.</p>

    <p>Hitherto, the active life of the island, the shade of trees,
    hut or cave, the power of unrestricted movement and the
    possession of water in any desired quantity, robbed the
    tropical heat of the day of its chief terrors. Now all was
    changed. Instead of working amidst grateful foliage, they were
    bound to the brown rock, which soon would glow with radiated
    energy and give off scorching gusts like unto the opening of a
    furnace-door.</p>

    <p>This he had foreseen all along. The tarpaulin would yield
    them some degree of uneasy protection, and they both were in
    perfect physical condition. But&mdash;if Iris were wounded! If
    the extra strain brought fever in its wake! That way he saw
    nothing but blank despair, to be ended, for her, by delirium
    and merciful death, for him by a Berserk rush among the Dyaks,
    and one last mad fight against overwhelming numbers.</p>

    <p>Then the girl's voice reached him, self-reliant, almost
    cheerful&mdash;</p>

    <p>"You will be glad to hear that the cut has stopped bleeding.
    It is only a scratch."</p>

    <p>So a kindly Providence had spared them yet a little while.
    The cloud passed from his mind, the gathering mist from his
    eyes. In that instant he thought he detected a slight rustling
    among the trees where the cliff shelved up from the house.
    Standing as he was on the edge of the rock, this was a point he
    could not guard against.</p>

    <p>When her welcome assurance recalled his scattered senses, he
    stepped back to speak to her, and in the same instant a couple
    of bullets crashed against the rock overhead. Iris had
    unwittingly saved him from a serious, perhaps fatal, wound.</p>

    <p>He sprang to the extreme right of the ledge and boldly
    looked into the trees beneath. Two Dyaks were there, belated
    wanderers cut off from the main body. They dived headlong into
    the undergrowth for safety, but one of them was too late. The
    Lee-Metford reached him, and its reverberating concussion,
    tossed back and forth by the echoing rocks, drowned his parting
    scream.</p>

    <p>In the plenitude of restored vigor the sailor waited for no
    counter demonstration. He turned and crouchingly approached the
    southern end of his parapet. Through his screen of grass he
    could discern the long black hair and yellow face of a man who
    lay on the sand and twisted his head around the base of the
    further cliff. The distance, oft measured, was ninety yards,
    the target practically a six-inch bull's-eye. Jenks took
    careful aim, fired, and a whiff of sand flew up.</p>

    <p>Perhaps he had used too fine a sight and ploughed a furrow
    beneath the Dyak's ear. He only heard a faint yell, but the
    enterprising head vanished and there were no more volunteers
    for that particular service.</p>

    <p>He was still peering at the place when a cry of unmitigated
    anguish came from Iris&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Oh, come quick! Our water! The casks have burst!"</p>

    <p>It was not until Jenks had torn the tarpaulin from off their
    stores, and he was wildly striving with both hands to scoop up
    some precious drops collected in the small hollows of the
    ledge, that he realized the full magnitude of the disaster
    which had befallen them.</p>

    <p>During the first rapid exchange of fire, before the enemy
    vacated the cliff, several bullets had pierced the tarpaulin.
    By a stroke of exceeding bad fortune two of them had struck
    each of the water-barrels and started the staves. The contents
    quietly ebbed away beneath the broad sheet, and flowing inwards
    by reason of the sharp slope of the ledge, percolated through
    the fault. Iris and he, notwithstanding their frenzied efforts,
    were not able to save more than a pint of gritty discolored
    fluid. The rest, infinitely more valuable to them than all the
    diamonds of De Beers, was now oozing through the natural
    channel cut by centuries of storm, dripping upon the headless
    skeleton in the cave, soaking down to the very heart of their
    buried treasure.</p>

    <p>Jenks was so paralyzed by this catastrophe that Iris became
    alarmed. As yet she did not grasp its awful significance. That
    he, her hero, so brave, so confident in the face of many
    dangers, should betray such sense of irredeemable loss,
    frightened her much more than the incident itself.</p>

    <p>Her lips whitened. Her words become incoherent.</p>

    <p>"Tell me," she whispered. "I can bear anything but silence.
    Tell me, I implore you. Is it so bad?"</p>

    <p>The sight of her distress sobered him. He ground his teeth
    together as a man does who submits to a painful operation and
    resolves not to flinch beneath the knife.</p>

    <p>"It is very bad," he said; "not quite the end, but near
    it."</p>

    <p>"The end," she bravely answered, "is death! We are living
    and uninjured. You must fight on. If the Lord wills it we shall
    not die."</p>

    <p>He looked in her blue eyes and saw there the light of
    Heaven.</p>

    <p>"God bless you, dear girl," he murmured brokenly. "You would
    cheer any man through the Valley of the Shadow, were he
    Christian or Faint-heart."</p>

    <p>Her glance did not droop before his. In such moments heart
    speaks to heart without concealment.</p>

    <p>"We still have a little water," she cried. "Fortunately we
    are not thirsty. You have not forgotten our supply of champagne
    and brandy?"</p>

    <p>There was a species of mad humor in the suggestion. Oh for
    another miracle that should change the wine into water!</p>

    <p>He could only fall in with her unreflective mood and leave
    the dreadful truth to its own evil time. In their little nook
    the power of the sun had not yet made itself felt. By ordinary
    computation it was about nine o'clock. Long before noon they
    would be grilling. Throughout the next few hours they must
    suffer the torture of Dives with one meager pint of water to
    share between them. Of course the wine and spirit must be
    shunned like a pestilence. To touch either under such
    conditions would be courting heat, apoplexy, and death. And
    next day!</p>

    <p>He tightened his jaws before he answered&mdash;</p>

    <p>"We will console ourselves with a bottle of champagne for
    dinner. Meanwhile, I hear our friends shouting to those left on
    this side of the island. I must take an active interest in the
    conversation."</p>

    <p>He grasped a rifle and lay down on the ledge, already
    gratefully warm. There was a good deal of sustained shouting
    going on. Jenks thought he recognized the chief's voice, giving
    instructions to those who had come from Smugglers' Cove and
    were now standing on the beach near the quarry.</p>

    <p>"I wonder if he is hungry," he thought. "If so, I will
    interfere with the commissariat."</p>

    <p>Iris peeped forth at him.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Jenks!"</p>

    <p>"Yes," without turning his head. He knew it was an ordinary
    question.</p>

    <p>"May I come too?"</p>

    <p>"What! expose yourself on the ledge!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, even that. I am so tired of sitting here alone."</p>

    <p>"Well, there is no danger at present. But they might chance
    to see you, and you remember what I&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I remember quite well. If that is all&mdash;" There
    was a rustle of garments. "I am very mannish in appearance. If
    you promise not to look at me I will join you."</p>

    <p>"I promise."</p>

    <p>Iris stepped forth. She was flushed a little, and, to cover
    her confusion, may be, she picked up a Lee-Metford.</p>

    <p>"Now there are two guns," she said, as she stood near
    him.</p>

    <p>He could see through the tail of his eye that a slight but
    elegantly proportioned young gentleman of the sea-faring
    profession had suddenly appeared from nowhere. He was glad she
    had taken this course. It might better the position were the
    Dyaks to see her thus.</p>

    <p>"The moment I tell you, you must fall flat," he warned her.
    "No ceremony about it. Just flop!"</p>

    <p>"I don't know anything better calculated to make one flop
    than a bullet," she laughed. Not yet did the tragedy of the
    broken kegs appeal to her.</p>

    <p>"Yes, but it achieves its purpose in two ways. I want you to
    adopt the precautionary method."</p>

    <p>"Trust me for that. Good gracious!"</p>

    <p>The sailor's rifle went off with an unexpected bang that
    froze the exclamation on her lips. Three Dyaks were attempting
    to run the gauntlet to their beleaguered comrades. They carried
    a jar and two wicker baskets. He with the jar fell and broke
    it. The others doubled back like hares, and the first man
    dragged himself after them. Jenks did not fire again.</p>

    <p>Iris watched the wounded wretch crawling along the ground.
    Her eyes grew moist, and she paled somewhat. When he vanished
    she looked into the valley and at the opposing ledge; three men
    lay dead within twenty yards of her. Two others dangled from
    the rocks. It took her some time to control her quavering
    utterance sufficiently to say&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I hope I may not have to use a gun. I know it cannot be
    helped, but if I were to kill a human being I do not think I
    would ever rest again."</p>

    <p>"In that case I have indeed murdered sleep today," was the
    unfeeling reply.</p>

    <p>"No! no! A man must be made of sterner stuff. We have a
    right to defend ourselves. If need be I will exercise that
    right. Still it is horrid, oh, so horrid!"</p>

    <p>She could not see the sailor's grim smile. It would
    materially affect his rest, for the better, were he able to
    slay every Dyak on the island with a single shot. Yet her
    gentle protest pleased him. She could not at the same time be
    callous to human suffering and be Iris. But he declined the
    discussion of such sentiments.</p>

    <p>"You were going to say something when a brief disturbance
    took place?" he inquired.</p>

    <p>"Yes. I was surprised to find how hot the ledge has
    become."</p>

    <p>"You notice it more because you are obliged to remain
    here."</p>

    <p>After a pause&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I think I understand now why you were so upset by the loss
    of our water supply. Before the day ends we will be in great
    straits, enduring agonies from thirst!"</p>

    <p>"Let us not meet the devil half-way," he rejoined. He
    preferred the unfair retort to a confession which could only
    foster dismay.</p>

    <p>"But, please, I am thirsty now."</p>

    <p>He moved uneasily. He was only too conscious of the impish
    weakness, common to all mankind, which creates a desire out of
    sheer inability to satisfy it. Already his own throat was
    parched. The excitement of the early struggle was in itself
    enough to engender an acute thirst. He thought it best to meet
    their absolute needs as far as possible.</p>

    <p>"Bring the tin cup," he said. "Let us take half our store
    and use the remainder when we eat. Try to avoid breathing
    through your mouth. The hot air quickly affects the palate and
    causes an artificial dryness. We cannot yet be in real need of
    water. It is largely imagination."</p>

    <p>Iris needed no second bidding. She carefully measured out
    half a pint of the unsavory fluid&mdash;the dregs of the casks
    and the scourings of the ledge.</p>

    <p>"I will drink first," she cried.</p>

    <p>"No, no," he interrupted impatiently. "Give it to me."</p>

    <p>She pretended to be surprised.</p>

    <p>"As a mere matter of politeness&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I am sorry, but I must insist."</p>

    <p>She gave him the cup over his shoulder. He placed it to his
    lips and gulped steadily.</p>

    <p>"There," he said, gruffly. "I was in a hurry. The Dyaks may
    make another rush at any moment."</p>

    <p>Iris looked into the vessel.</p>

    <p>"You have taken none at all," she said.</p>

    <p>"Nonsense!"</p>

    <p>"Mr. Jenks, be reasonable! You need it more than I. I
    d-don't want to&mdash;live w-without&mdash;you."</p>

    <p>His hands shook somewhat. It was well there was no call for
    accurate shooting just then.</p>

    <p>"I assure you I took all I required," he declared with
    unnecessary vehemence.</p>

    <p>"At least drink your share, to please me," she murmured.</p>

    <p>"You wished to humbug me," he grumbled. "If you will take
    the first half I will take the second."</p>

    <p>And they settled it that way. The few mouthfuls of tepid
    water gave them new life. One sense can deceive the others. A
    man developing all the symptoms of hydrophobia has been cured
    by the assurance that the dog which bit him was not mad. So
    these two, not yet aflame with drought, banished the arid
    phantom for a little while.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, by high noon they were suffering again. The
    time passed very slowly. The sun rose to the zenith and filled
    earth and air with his ardor. It seemed to be a
    miracle&mdash;now appreciated for the first time in their
    lives&mdash;that the sea did not dry up, and the leaves wither
    on the trees. The silence, the deathly inactivity of all
    things, became intolerable. The girl bravely tried to confine
    her thoughts to the task of the hour. She displayed alert
    watchfulness, an instant readiness to warn her companion of the
    slightest movement among the trees or by the rocks to the
    north-west, this being the arc of their periphery assigned to
    her.</p>

    <p>Looking at a sunlit space from cover, and looking at the
    same place when sweltering in the direct rays of a tropical
    sun, are kindred operations strangely diverse in achievement.
    Iris could not reconcile the physical sensitiveness of the hour
    with the careless hardihood of the preceding days. Her eyes
    ached somewhat, for she had tilted her sou'wester to the back
    of her head in the effort to cool her throbbing temples. She
    put up her right hand to shade the too vivid reflection of the
    glistening sea, and was astounded to find that in a few minutes
    the back of her hand was scorched. A faint sound of distant
    shouting disturbed her painful reverie.</p>

    <p>"How is it," she asked, "that we feel the heat so much
    today? I have hardly noticed it before."</p>

    <p>"For two good reasons&mdash;forced idleness and radiation
    from this confounded rock. Moreover, this is the hottest day we
    have experienced on the island. There is not a breath of air,
    and the hot weather has just commenced."</p>

    <p>"Don't you think," she said, huskily, "that our position
    here is quite hopeless?"</p>

    <p>They were talking to each other sideways. The sailor never
    turned his gaze from the southern end of the valley.</p>

    <p>"It is no more hopeless now than last night or this
    morning," he replied.</p>

    <p>"But suppose we are kept here for several days?"</p>

    <p>"That was always an unpleasant probability."</p>

    <p>"We had water then. Even with an ample supply it would be
    difficult to hold out. As things are, such a course becomes
    simply impossible."</p>

    <p>Her despondency pierced his soul. A slow agony was consuming
    her.</p>

    <p>"It is hard, I admit," he said. "Nevertheless you must bear
    up until night falls. Then we will either obtain water or leave
    this place."</p>

    <p>"Surely we can do neither."</p>

    <p>"We may be compelled to do both."</p>

    <p>"But how?"</p>

    <p>In this, his hour of extremest need, the man was vouchsafed
    a shred of luck. To answer her satisfactorily would have
    baffled a Talleyrand. But before he could frame a feeble
    pretext for his too sanguine prediction, a sampan appeared,
    eight hundred yards from Turtle Beach, and strenuously paddled
    by three men. The vague hallooing they had heard was
    explained.</p>

    <p>The Dyaks, though to the manner born, were weary of
    sun-scorched rocks and salt water. The boat was coming in
    response to their signals, and the sight inspired Jenks with
    fresh hope. Like a lightning flash came the reflection that if
    he could keep them away from the well and destroy the sampan
    now hastening to their assistance, perhaps conveying the bulk
    of their stores, they would soon tire of slaking their thirst,
    on the few pitcher-plants growing on the north shore.</p>

    <p>"Come quick," he shouted, adjusting the backsight of a
    rifle. "Lie down and aim at the front of that boat, a little
    short if anything. It doesn't matter if the bullets strike the
    sea first."</p>

    <p>He placed the weapon in readiness for her and commenced
    operations himself before Iris could reach his side. Soon both
    rifles were pitching twenty shots a minute at the sampan. The
    result of their long-range practice was not long in doubt. The
    Dyaks danced from seat to seat in a state of wild excitement.
    One man was hurled overboard. Then the craft lurched seaward in
    the strong current, and Jenks told Iris to leave the rest to
    him.</p>

    <p>Before he could empty a second magazine a fortunate bullet
    ripped a plank out and the sampan filled and went down, amidst
    a shrill yell of execration from the back of the cliff. The two
    Dyaks yet living endeavored to swim ashore, half a mile through
    shark-invested reefs. The sailor did not even trouble about
    them. After a few frantic struggles each doomed wretch flung up
    his arms and vanished. In the clear atmosphere the on-lookers
    could see black fins cutting the pellucid sea.</p>

    <p>This exciting episode dispelled the gathering mists from the
    girl's brain. Her eyes danced and she breathed hard. Yet
    something worried her.</p>

    <p>"I hope I didn't hit the man who fell out of the boat," she
    said.</p>

    <p>"Oh," came the prompt assurance, "I took deliberate aim at
    that chap. He was a most persistent scoundrel."</p>

    <p>Iris was satisfied. Jenks thought it better to lie than to
    tell the truth, for the bald facts hardly bore out his
    assertion. Judging from the manner of the Dyak's involuntary
    plunge he had been hit by a ricochet bullet, whilst the
    sailor's efforts were wholly confined to sinking the sampan.
    However, let it pass. Bullet or shark, the end was the
    same.</p>

    <p>They were quieting down&mdash;the thirst fiend was again
    slowly salting their veins&mdash;when something of a dirty
    white color fluttered into sight from behind the base of the
    opposite cliff. It was rapidly withdrawn, to reappear after an
    interval. Now it was held more steadily and a brown arm became
    visible. As Jenks did not fire, a turbaned head popped into
    sight. It was the Mahommedan.</p>

    <p>"No shoot it," he roared. "Me English speak it."</p>

    <p>"Don't you speak Hindustani?" shouted Jenks in Urdu of the
    Higher Proficiency.</p>

    <p>"Ha&ntilde;, sahib!"<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href=
       "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> was the joyful response. "Will
       your honor permit his servant to come and talk with
       him?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, if you come unarmed."</p>

    <p>"And the chief, too, sahib?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, but listen! On the first sign of treachery I shoot
    both of you!"</p>

    <p>"We will keep faith, sahib. May kites pick our bones if we
    fail!"</p>

    <p>Then there stepped into full view the renegade Mussulman and
    his leader. They carried no guns; the chief wore his kriss.</p>

    <p class="figcenter"><a href=
         "images/wm_12_1.png"><img alt="The two halted some ten paces in front of the cavern."
         src="images/wm_12_1_th.png"></a></p>

    <p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The two halted some
    ten paces in front of the cavern. and the belligerents surveyed
    each other.</span></p>

    <p>"Tell him to leave that dagger behind!" cried the sailor
    imperiously. As the enemy demanded a parley he resolved to
    adopt the conqueror's tone from the outset. The chief obeyed
    with a scowl, and the two advanced to the foot of the rock.</p>

    <p>"Stand close to me," said Jenks to Iris. "Let them see you
    plainly, but pull your hat well down over your eyes."</p>

    <p>She silently followed his instructions. Now that the very
    crisis of their fate had arrived she was nervous, shaken,
    conscious only of a desire to sink on her knees, and pray.</p>

    <p>One or two curious heads were craned round the corner of the
    rock.</p>

    <p>"Stop!" cried Jenks. "If those men do not instantly go away
    I will fire at them."</p>

    <p>The Indian translated this order and the chief vociferated
    some clanging syllables which had the desired effect. The two
    halted some ten paces in front of the cavern, and the
    belligerents surveyed each other. It was a fascinating
    spectacle, this drama in real life. The yellow-faced Dyak,
    gaudily attired in a crimson jacket and sky-blue pantaloons of
    Chinese silk&mdash;a man with the <i>beaut&eacute; du
    diable</i>, young, and powerfully built&mdash;and the
    brown-skinned white-clothed Mahommedan, bony, tall, and grey
    with hardship, looked up at the occupants of the ledge. Iris,
    slim and boyish in her male garments, was dwarfed by the
    six-foot sailor, but her face was blood-stained, and Jenks wore
    a six weeks' stubble of beard. Holding their Lee-Metfords with
    alert ease, with revolvers strapped to their sides, they
    presented a warlike and imposing tableau in their inaccessible
    perch. In the path of the emissaries lay the bodies of the
    slain. The Dyak leader scowled again as he passed them.</p>

    <p>"Sahib," began the Indian, "my chief, Taung S'Ali, does not
    wish to have any more of his men killed in a foolish quarrel
    about a woman. Give her up, he says, and he will either leave
    you here in peace, or carry you safely to some place where you
    can find a ship manned by white men."</p>

    <p>"A woman!" said Jenks, scornfully. "That is idle talk! What
    woman is here?"</p>

    <p>This question nonplussed the native.</p>

    <p>"The woman whom the chief saw half a month back, sahib."</p>

    <p>"Taung S'Ali was bewitched. I slew his men so quickly that
    he saw spirits."</p>

    <p>The chief caught his name and broke in with a question. A
    volley of talk between the two was enlivened with expressive
    gestures by Taung S'Ali, who several times pointed to Iris, and
    Jenks now anathematized his thoughtless folly in permitting the
    Dyak to approach so near. The Mahommedan, of course, had never
    seen her, and might have persuaded the other that in truth
    there were two men only on the rock.</p>

    <p>His fears were only too well founded. The Mussulman salaamed
    respectfully and said&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Protector of the poor, I cannot gainsay your word, but
    Taung S'Ali says that the maid stands by your side, and is none
    the less the woman he seeks in that she wears a man's
    clothing."</p>

    <p>"He has sharp eyes, but his brain is addled," retorted the
    sailor. "Why does he come here to seek a woman who is not of
    his race? Not only has he brought death to his people and
    narrowly escaped it himself, but he must know that any violence
    offered to us will mean the extermination of his whole tribe by
    an English warship. Tell him to take away his boats and never
    visit this isle again. Perhaps I will then forget his
    treacherous attempt to murder us whilst we slept last
    night."</p>

    <p>The chief glared back defiantly, whilst the Mahommedan
    said&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Sahib, it is beet not to anger him too much. He says he
    means to have the girl. He saw her beauty that day and she
    inflamed his heart. She has cost him many lives, but she is
    worth a Sultan's ransom. He cares not for warships. They cannot
    reach his village in the hills. By the tomb of Nizam-ud-din,
    sahib, he will not harm you if you give her up, but if you
    refuse he will kill you both. And what is one woman more or
    less in the world that she should cause strife and
    blood-letting?"</p>

    <p>The sailor knew the Eastern character too well not to
    understand the man's amazement that he should be so solicitous
    about the fate of one of the weaker sex. It was seemingly
    useless to offer terms, yet the native was clearly so anxious
    for an amicable settlement that he caught at a straw.</p>

    <p>"You come from Delhi?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"Honored one, you have great wisdom."</p>

    <p>"None but a Delhi man swears by the tomb on the road to the
    Kutub. You have escaped from the Andamans?"</p>

    <p>"Sahib, I did but slay a man in self-defence."</p>

    <p>"Whatever the cause, you can never again see India.
    Nevertheless, you would give many years of your life to mix
    once more with the bazaar-folk in the Chandni Chowk, and sit at
    night on a charpoy near the Lahore Gate?"</p>

    <p>The brown skin assumed a sallow tinge.</p>

    <p>"That is good speaking," he gurgled.</p>

    <p>"Then help me and my friend to escape. Compel your chief to
    leave the island. Kill him! Plot against him! I will promise
    you freedom and plenty of rupees. Do this, and I swear to you I
    will come in a ship and take you away. The miss-sahib's father
    is powerful. He has great influence with the Sirkar."<a id=
    "footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href=
       "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

    <p>Taung S'Ali was evidently bewildered and annoyed by this
    passionate appeal which he did not understand. He demanded an
    explanation, and the ready-witted native was obliged to invent
    some plausible excuse. Yet when he raised his face to Jenks
    there was the look of a hunted animal in his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Sahib," he said, endeavoring to conceal his agitation. "I
    am one among many. A word from me and they would cut my throat.
    If I were with you there on the rock I would die with you, for
    I was in the Kumaon Rissala<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href=
       "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> when the trouble befell me. It
       is of no avail to bargain with a tiger, sahib. I suppose you
       will not give up the miss-sahib. Pretend to argue with me. I
       will help in any way possible."</p>

    <p>Jenks's heart bounded when this unlooked-for offer reached
    his ears. The unfortunate Mahommedan was evidently eager to get
    away from the piratical gang into whose power he had fallen.
    But the chief was impatient, if not suspicious of these long
    speeches.</p>

    <p>Angrily holding forth a Lee-Metford the sailor
    shouted&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Tell Taung S'Ali that I will slay him and all his men ere
    tomorrow's sun rises. He knows something of my power, but not
    all. Tonight, at the twelfth hour, you will find a rope hanging
    from the rock. Tie thereto a vessel of water. Fail not in this.
    I will not forget your services. I am Anstruther Sahib, of the
    Belgaum Rissala."</p>

    <p>The native translated his words into a fierce defiance of
    Taung S'Ali and his Dyaks. The chief glanced at Jenks and Iris
    with an ominous smile. He muttered something.</p>

    <p>"Then, sahib. There is nothing more to be said. Beware of
    the trees on your right. They can send silent death even to the
    place where you stand. And I will not fail you tonight, on my
    life," cried the interpreter.</p>

    <p>"I believe you. Go! But inform your chief that once you have
    disappeared round the rock whence you came I will talk to him
    only with a rifle."</p>

    <p>Taung S'Ali seemed to comprehend the Englishman's emphatic
    motions. Waving his hand defiantly, the Dyak turned, and, with
    one parting glance of mute assurance, the Indian followed
    him.</p>

    <p>And now there came to Jenks a great temptation. Iris touched
    his arm and whispered&mdash;</p>

    <p>"What have you decided? I did not dare to speak lest he
    should hear my voice."</p>

    <p>Poor girl! She was sure the Dyak could not penetrate her
    disguise, though she feared from the manner in which the
    conference broke up that it had not been satisfactory.</p>

    <p>Jenks did not answer her. He knew that if he killed Taung
    S'Ali his men would be so dispirited that when the night came
    they would fly. There was so much at stake&mdash;Iris, wealth,
    love, happiness, life itself&mdash;all depended on his plighted
    word. Yet his savage enemy, a slayer of women, a human vampire
    soiled with every conceivable crime, was stalking back to
    safety with a certain dignified strut, calmly trusting to the
    white man's bond.</p>

    <p>Oh, it was cruel! The ordeal of that ghastly moment was more
    trying than all that he had hitherto experienced. He gave a
    choking sob of relief when the silken-clad scoundrel passed out
    of sight without even deigning to give another glance at the
    ledge or at those who silently watched him.</p>

    <p>Iris could not guess the nature of the mortal struggle
    raging in the sailor's soul.</p>

    <p>"Tell me," she repeated, "what have you done?"</p>

    <p>"Kept faith with that swaggering ruffian," he said, with an
    odd feeling of thankfulness that he spoke truly.</p>

    <p>"Why? Have you made him any promise?"</p>

    <p>"Unhappily I permitted him to come here, so I had to let him
    go. He recognized you instantly."</p>

    <p>This surprised her greatly.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure? I saw him pointing at me, but he seemed to be
    in such a bad temper that I imagined that he was angry with you
    for exchanging a prepossessing young lady for an ill-favored
    youth."</p>

    <p>Jenks with difficulty suppressed a sigh. Her words for an
    instant had the old piquant flavor.</p>

    <p>Keeping a close watch on the sheltering promontory, he told
    her all that had taken place. Iris became very downcast when
    she grasped the exact state of affairs. She was almost certain
    when the Dyaks proposed a parley that reasonable terms would
    result. It horrified her beyond measure to find that she was
    the rock on which negotiations were wrecked. Hope died within
    her. The bitterness of death was in her breast.</p>

    <p>"What an unlucky influence I have had on your existence!"
    she exclaimed. "If it were not for me this trouble at least
    would be spared you. Because I am here you are condemned.
    Again, because I stopped you from shooting that wretched chief
    and his companions they are now demanding your life as a
    forfeit. It is all my fault. I cannot bear it."</p>

    <p>She was on the verge of tears. The strain had become too
    great for her. After indulging in a wild dream of freedom, to
    be told that they must again endure the irksome confinement,
    the active suffering, the slow horrors of a siege in that rocky
    prison, almost distracted her.</p>

    <p>Jenks was very stern and curt in his reply.</p>

    <p>"We must make the best of a bad business," he said. "If we
    are in a tight place the Dyaks are not much better off, and
    eighteen of their number are dead or wounded. You forget, too,
    that Providence has sent us a most useful ally in the
    Mahommedan. When all is said and done, things might be far
    worse than they are."</p>

    <p>Never before had his tone been so cold, his manner so
    abrupt, not even in the old days when he purposely endeavored
    to make her dislike him.</p>

    <p>She walked along the ledge and timidly bent over him.</p>

    <p>"Forgive me!" she whispered; "I did forget for the moment,
    not only the goodness of Providence, but also your
    self-sacrificing devotion. I am only a woman, and I don't want
    to die yet, but I will not live unless you too are saved."</p>

    <p>Once already that day she had expressed this thought in
    other words. Was some shadowy design flitting through her
    brain? Suppose they were faced with the alternatives of dying
    from thirst or yielding to the Dyaks. Was there another way
    out? Jenks shivered, though the rock was grilling him. He must
    divert her mind from this dreadful brooding.</p>

    <p>"The fact is," he said with a feeble attempt at
    cheerfulness, "we are both hungry and consequently grumpy. Now,
    suppose you prepare lunch. We will feel ever so much better
    after we have eaten."</p>

    <p>The girl choked back her emotion, and sadly essayed the task
    of providing a meal which was hateful to her. In doing so she
    saw her Bible, lying where she had placed it that morning, the
    leaves still open at the 91st Psalm. She had indeed forgotten
    the promise it contained&mdash;</p>

    <p>"For He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee
    in all thy ways."</p>

    <p>A few tears fell now and made little furrows down her soiled
    cheeks. But they were helpful tears, tears of resignation, not
    of despair. Although the "destruction that wasteth at noonday"
    was trying her sorely she again felt strong and sustained.</p>

    <p>She even smiled on detecting an involuntary effort to clear
    her stained face. She was about to carry a biscuit and some
    tinned meat to the sailor when a sharp exclamation from him
    caused her to hasten to his side.</p>

    <p>The Dyaks had broken cover. Running in scattered sections
    across the sands, they were risking such loss as the defenders
    might be able to inflict upon them during a brief race to the
    shelter and food to be obtained in the other part of the
    island.</p>

    <p>Jenks did not fire at the scurrying gang. He was waiting for
    one man, Taung S'Ali. But that redoubtable person, having
    probably suggested this dash for liberty, had fully realized
    the enviable share of attention he would attract during the
    passage. He therefore discarded his vivid attire, and, by
    borrowing odd garments, made himself sufficiently like unto the
    remainder of his crew to deceive the sailor until the rush of
    men was over. Among them ran the Mahommedan, who did not look
    up the valley but waved his hand.</p>

    <p>When all had quieted down again Jenks understood how he had
    been fooled. He laughed so heartily that Iris, not knowing
    either the cause of his merriment or the reason of his
    unlooked-for clemency to the flying foe, feared the sun had
    affected him.</p>

    <p>He at once quitted the post occupied during so protracted a
    vigil.</p>

    <p>"Now," he cried, "we can eat in peace. I have stripped the
    chief of his finery. His men can twit him on being forced to
    shed his gorgeous plumage in order to save his life. Anyhow,
    they will leave us in peace until night falls, so we must make
    the best of a hot afternoon."</p>

    <p>But he was mistaken. A greater danger than any yet
    experienced now threatened them, though Iris, after perusing
    that wonderful psalm, might have warned him of it had she known
    the purpose of those long bamboos carried by some of the
    savages.</p>

    <p>For Taung S'Ali, furious and unrelenting, resolved that if
    he could not obtain the girl he would slay the pair of them;
    and he had terrible weapons in his possession&mdash;weapons
    that could send "silent death even to the place where they
    stood."</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

    <h2>REALITY <i>V</i>. ROMANCE&mdash;THE CASE FOR THE
    DEFENDANT</h2>

    <p>Residents in tropical countries know that the heat is
    greatest, or certainly least bearable, between two and four
    o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

    <p>At the conclusion of a not very luscious repast, Jenks
    suggested that they should rig up the tarpaulin in such wise as
    to gain protection from the sun and yet enable him to cast a
    watchful eye over the valley. Iris helped to raise the great
    canvas sheet on the supports he had prepared. Once shut off
    from the devouring sun rays, the hot breeze then springing into
    fitful existence cooled their blistered but perspiring skin and
    made life somewhat tolerable.</p>

    <p>Still adhering to his policy of combatting the first
    enervating attacks of thirst, the sailor sanctioned the
    consumption of the remaining water. As a last desperate
    expedient, to be resorted to only in case of sheer necessity,
    he uncorked a bottle of champagne and filled the tin cup. The
    sparkling wine, with its volume of creamy foam, looked so
    tempting that Iris would then and there have risked its potency
    were she not promptly withheld.</p>

    <p>Jenks explained to her that when the wine became quite flat
    and insipid they might use it to moisten their parched lips.
    Even so, in their present super-heated state, the liquor was
    unquestionably dangerous, but he hoped it would not harm them
    if taken in minute quantities.</p>

    <p>Accustomed now to implicitly accept his advice, she fought
    and steadily conquered the craving within her. Oddly enough,
    the "thawing" of their scorched bodies beneath the tarpaulin
    brought a certain degree of relief. They were supremely
    uncomfortable, but that was as naught compared with the
    relaxation from the torments previously borne.</p>

    <p>For a long time&mdash;the best part of an hour,
    perhaps&mdash;they remained silent.</p>

    <p>The sailor was reviewing the pros and cons of their
    precarious condition. It would, of course, be a matter of
    supreme importance were the Indian to be faithful to his
    promise. Here the prospect was decidedly hopeful. The man was
    an old <i>sowar</i>, and the ex-officer of native cavalry knew
    how enduring was the attachment of this poor convict to home
    and military service. Probably at that moment the Mahommedan
    was praying to the Prophet and his two nephews to aid him in
    rescuing the sahib and the woman whom the sahib held so dear,
    for the all-wise and all-powerful Sirkar is very merciful to
    offending natives who thus condone their former crimes.</p>

    <p>But, howsoever willing he might be, what could one man do
    among so many? The Dyaks were hostile to him in race and creed,
    and assuredly infuriated against the foreign devil who had
    killed or wounded, in round numbers, one-fifth of their total
    force. Very likely, the hapless Mussulman would lose his life
    that night in attempting to bring water to the foot of the
    rock.</p>

    <p>Well, he, Jenks, might have something to say in that regard.
    By midnight the moon would illumine nearly the whole of
    Prospect Park. If the Mahommedan were slain in front of the
    cavern his soul would travel to the next world attended by a
    Nizam's cohort of slaughtered slaves.</p>

    <p>Even if the man succeeded in eluding the vigilance of his
    present associates, where was the water to come from? There was
    none on the island save that in the well. In all likelihood the
    Dyaks had a store in the remaining sampans, but the native ally
    of the beleaguered pair would have a task of exceeding
    difficulty in obtaining one of the jars or skins containing
    it.</p>

    <p>Again, granting all things went well that night, what would
    be the final outcome of the struggle? How long could Iris
    withstand the exposure, the strain, the heart-breaking misery
    of the rock? The future was blurred, crowded with ugly and
    affrighting fiends passing in fantastic array before his
    vision, and mouthing dumb threats of madness and death.</p>

    <p>He shook restlessly, not aware that the girl's sorrowful
    glance, luminous with love and pain, was fixed upon him.
    Summarily dismissing these grisly phantoms of the mind, he
    asked himself what the Mahommedan exactly meant by warning him
    against the trees on the right and the "silent death" that
    might come from them. He was about to crawl forth to the lip of
    the rock and investigate matters in that locality when Iris,
    who also was busy with her thoughts, restrained him.</p>

    <p>"Wait a little while," she said. "None of the Dyaks will
    venture into the open until night falls. And I have something
    to say to you."</p>

    <p>There was a quiet solemnity in her voice that Jenks had
    never heard before. It chilled him. His heart acknowledged a
    quick sense of evil omen. He raised himself slightly and turned
    towards her. Her face, beautiful and serene beneath its
    disfigurements, wore an expression of settled purpose. For the
    life of him he dared not question her.</p>

    <p>"That man, the interpreter," she said, "told you that if I
    were given up to the chief, he and his followers would go away
    and molest you no more."</p>

    <p>His forehead seamed with sudden anger.</p>

    <p>"A mere bait," he protested. "In any event it is hardly
    worth discussion."</p>

    <p>And the answer came, clear and resolute&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I think I will agree to those terms."</p>

    <p>At first he regarded her with undisguised and wordless
    amazement. Then the appalling thought darted through his brain
    that she contemplated this supreme sacrifice in order to save
    him. A clammy sweat bedewed his brow, but by sheer will power
    he contrived to say&mdash;</p>

    <p>"You must be mad to even dream of such a thing. Don't you
    understand what it means to you&mdash;and to me? It is a ruse
    to trap us. They are ungoverned savages. Once they had you in
    their power they would laugh at a promise made to me."</p>

    <p>"You may be mistaken. They must have some sense of fair
    dealing. Even assuming that such was their intention, they may
    depart from it. They have already lost a great many men. Their
    chief, having gained his main object, might not be able to
    persuade them to take further risks. I will make it a part of
    the bargain that they first supply you with plenty of water.
    Then you, unaided, could keep them at bay for many days. We
    lose nothing; we can gain a great deal by endeavoring to pacify
    them."</p>

    <p>"Iris!" he gasped, "what are you saying?"</p>

    <p>The unexpected sound of her name on his lips almost unnerved
    her. But no martyr ever went to the stake with more settled
    purpose than this pure woman, resolved to immolate herself for
    the sake of the man she loved. He had dared all for her, faced
    death in many shapes. Now it was her turn. Her eyes were lit
    with a seraphic fire, her sweet face resigned as that of an
    angel.</p>

    <p>"I have thought it out," she murmured, gazing at him
    steadily, yet scarce seeing him. "It is worth trying as a last
    expedient. We are abandoned by all, save the Lord; and it does
    not appear to be His holy will to help us on earth. We can
    struggle on here until we die. Is that right, when one of us
    may live?"</p>

    <p>Her very candor had betrayed her. She would go away with
    these monstrous captors, endure them, even flatter them, until
    she and they were far removed from the island. And
    then&mdash;she would kill herself. In her innocence she
    imagined that self-destruction, under such circumstances, was a
    pardonable offence. She only gave a life to save a life, and
    greater love than this is not known to God or man.</p>

    <p>The sailor, in a tempest of wrath and wild emotion, had it
    in his mind to compel her into reason, to shake her, as one
    shakes a wayward child.</p>

    <p>He rose to his knees with this half-formed notion in his
    fevered brain. Then he looked at her, and a mist seemed to shut
    her out from his sight. Was she lost to him already? Was all
    that had gone before an idle dream of joy and grief, a wizard's
    glimpse of mirrored happiness and vague perils? Was Iris, the
    crystal-souled&mdash;thrown to him by the storm-lashed
    waves&mdash;to be snatched away by some irresistible and malign
    influence?</p>

    <p>In the mere physical effort to assure himself that she was
    still near to him he gathered her up in his strong hands. Yes,
    she was there, breathing, wondering, palpitating. He folded her
    closely to his breast, and, yielding to the passionate longings
    of his tired heart, whispered to her&mdash;</p>

    <p>"My darling, do you think I can survive your loss? You are
    life itself to me. If we have to die, sweet one, let us die
    together."</p>

    <p>Then Iris flung her arms around his neck.</p>

    <p>"I am quite, quite happy now," she sobbed brokenly. "I
    didn't&mdash;imagine&mdash;it would come&mdash;this way,
    but&mdash;I am thankful&mdash;it has come."</p>

    <p class="figcenter"><a href=
         "images/wm_13_1.png"><img alt="Love, tremendous in its power, unfathomable in its mystery, had cast its spell over them."
         src="images/wm_13_1_th.png"></a></p>

    <p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Love, tremendous in
    its power, unfathomable in its mystery, had cast its spell over
    them.</span></p>

    <p>For a little while they yielded to the glamour of the divine
    knowledge that amidst the chaos of eternity each soul had found
    its mate. There was no need for words. Love, tremendous in its
    power, unfathomable in its mystery, had cast its spell over
    them. They were garbed in light, throned in a palace built by
    fairy hands. On all sides squatted the ghouls of privation,
    misery, danger, even grim death; but they heeded not the
    Inferno; they had created a Paradise in an earthly hell.</p>

    <p>Then Iris withdrew herself from the man's embrace. She was
    delightfully shy and timid now.</p>

    <p>"So you really do love me?" she whispered, crimson-faced,
    with shining eyes and parted lips.</p>

    <p>He drew her to him again and kissed her tenderly. For he had
    cast all doubt to the winds. No matter what the future had in
    store she was his, his only; it was not in man's power to part
    them. A glorious effulgence dazzled his brain. Her love had
    given him the strength of Goliath, the confidence of David. He
    would pluck her from the perils that environed her. The Dyak
    was not yet born who should rend her from him.</p>

    <p>He fondled her hair and gently rubbed her cheek with his
    rough fingers. The sudden sense of ownership of this fair woman
    was entrancing. It almost bewildered him to find Iris nestling
    close, clinging to him in utter confidence and trust.</p>

    <p>"But I knew, I knew," she murmured. "You betrayed yourself
    so many times. You wrote your secret to me, and, though you did
    not tell me, I found your dear words on the sands, and have
    treasured them next my heart."</p>

    <p>What girlish romance was this? He held her away gingerly,
    just so far that he could look into her eyes.</p>

    <p>"Oh, it is true, quite true," she cried, drawing the locket
    from her neck. "Don't you recognize your own handwriting, or
    were you not certain, just then, that you really did love
    me?"</p>

    <p>Dear, dear! How often would she repeat that wondrous phrase!
    Together they bent over the tiny slips of paper. There it was
    again&mdash;"I love you"&mdash;twice blazoned in magic symbols.
    With blushing eagerness she told him how, by mere accident of
    course, she caught sight of her own name. It was not very
    wrong, was it, to pick up that tiny scrap, or those others,
    which she could not help seeing, and which unfolded their
    simple tale so truthfully? Wrong! It was so delightfully right
    that he must kiss her again to emphasize his convictions.</p>

    <p>All this fondling and love-making had, of course, an air of
    grotesque absurdity because indulged in by two grimy and
    tattered individuals crouching beneath a tarpaulin on a rocky
    ledge, and surrounded by bloodthirsty savages intent on their
    destruction. Such incidents require the setting of convention,
    the conservatory, with its wealth of flowers and plants, a
    summer wood, a Chippendale drawing-room. And yet, God wot, men
    and women have loved each other in this grey old world without
    stopping to consider the appropriateness of place and
    season.</p>

    <p>After a delicious pause Iris began again&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Robert&mdash;I must call you Robert now&mdash;there, there,
    please let me get a word in even edgeways&mdash;well then,
    Robert dear, I do not care much what happens now. I suppose it
    was very wicked and foolish of me to speak as I did
    before&mdash;before you called me Iris. Now tell me at once.
    Why did you call me Iris?"</p>

    <p>"You must propound that riddle to your godfather."</p>

    <p>"No wriggling, please. Why did you do it?"</p>

    <p>"Because I could not help myself. It slid out unawares."</p>

    <p>"How long have you thought of me only as Iris, your
    Iris?"</p>

    <p>"Ever since I first understood that somewhere in the wide
    world was a dear woman to love me and be loved."</p>

    <p>"But at one time you thought her name was Elizabeth?"</p>

    <p>"A delusion, a mirage! That is why those who christened you
    had the wisdom of the gods."</p>

    <p>Another interlude. They grew calmer, more sedate. It was so
    undeniably true they loved one another that the fact was
    becoming venerable with age. Iris was perhaps the first to
    recognize its quiet certainty.</p>

    <p>"As I cannot get you to talk reasonably," she protested, "I
    must appeal to your sympathy. I am hungry, and oh, so
    thirsty."</p>

    <p>The girl had hardly eaten a morsel for her midday meal. Then
    she was despondent, utterly broken-hearted. Now she was filled
    with new hope. There was a fresh motive in existence. Whether
    destined to live an hour or half a century, she would never,
    never leave him, nor, of course, could he ever, ever leave her.
    Some things were quite impossible&mdash;for example, that they
    should part.</p>

    <p>Jenks brought her a biscuit, a tin of meat, and that most
    doleful cup of champagne.</p>

    <p>"It is not exactly <i>frapp&eacute;</i>," he said, handing
    her the insipid beverage, "but, under other conditions, it is a
    wine almost worthy to toast you in."</p>

    <p>She fancied she had never before noticed what a charming
    smile he had.</p>

    <p>"'Toast' is a peculiarly suitable word," she cried. "I am
    simply frizzling. In these warm clothes&mdash;"</p>

    <p>She stopped. For the first time since that prehistoric
    period when she was "Miss Deane" and he "Mr. Jenks" she
    remembered the manner of her garments.</p>

    <p>"It is not the warm clothing you feel so much as the want of
    air," explained the sailor readily. "This tarpaulin has made
    the place very stuffy, but we must put up with it until
    sundown. By the way, what is that?"</p>

    <p>A light tap on the tarred canvas directly over his head had
    caught his ear. Iris, glad of the diversion, told him she had
    heard the noise three or four times, but fancied it was caused
    by the occasional rustling of the sheet on the uprights.</p>

    <p>Jenks had not allowed his attention to wander altogether
    from external events. Since the Dyaks' last escapade there was
    no sign of them in the valley or on either beach. Not for
    trivial cause would they come again within range of the
    Lee-Metfords.</p>

    <p>They waited and listened silently. Another tap sounded on
    the tarpaulin in a different place, and they both concurred in
    the belief that something had darted in curved flight over the
    ledge and fallen on top of their protecting shield.</p>

    <p>"Let us see what the game is," exclaimed the sailor. He
    crept to the back of the ledge and drew himself up until he
    could reach over the sheet. He returned, carrying in his hand a
    couple of tiny arrows.</p>

    <p>"There are no less than seven of these things sticking in
    the canvas," he said. "They don't look very terrible. I suppose
    that is what my Indian friend meant by warning me against the
    trees on the right."</p>

    <p>He did not tell Iris all the Mahommedan said. There was no
    need to alarm her causelessly. Even whilst they examined the
    curious little missile another flew up from the valley and
    lodged on the roof of their shelter.</p>

    <p>The shaft of the arrow, made of some extremely hard wood,
    was about ten inches in length. Affixed to it was a pointed
    fish-bone, sharp, but not barbed, and not fastened in a manner
    suggestive of much strength. The arrow was neither feathered
    nor grooved for a bowstring. Altogether it seemed to be a
    childish weapon to be used by men equipped with lead and
    steel.</p>

    <p>Jenks could not understand the appearance of this toy.
    Evidently the Dyaks believed in its efficacy, or they would not
    keep on pertinaciously dropping an arrow on the ledge.</p>

    <p>"How do they fire it?" asked Iris. "Do they throw it?"</p>

    <p>"I will soon tell you," he replied, reaching for a
    rifle.</p>

    <p>"Do not go out yet," she entreated him. "They cannot harm
    us. Perhaps we may learn more by keeping quiet. They will not
    continue shooting these things all day."</p>

    <p>Again a tiny arrow traveled towards them in a graceful
    parabola. This one fell short. Missing the tarpaulin, it almost
    dropped on the girl's outstretched hand. She picked it up. The
    fish-bone point had snapped by contact with the floor of the
    ledge.</p>

    <p>She sought for and found the small tip.</p>

    <p>"See," she said. "It seems to have been dipped in something.
    It is quite discolored."</p>

    <p>Jenks frowned peculiarly. A startling explanation had
    suggested itself to him. Fragments of forgotten lore were
    taking cohesion in his mind.</p>

    <p>"Put it down. Quick!" he cried.</p>

    <p>Iris obeyed him, with wonder in her eyes. He spilled a
    teasponful of champagne into a small hollow of the rock and
    steeped one of the fish-bones in the liquid. Within a few
    seconds the champagne assumed a greenish tinge and the bone
    became white. Then he knew.</p>

    <p>"Good Heavens!" he exclaimed, "these are poisoned arrows
    shot through a blowpipe. I have never before seen one, but I
    have often read about them. The bamboos the Dyaks carried were
    sumpitans. These fish-bones have been steeped in the juice of
    the upas tree. Iris, my dear girl, if one of them had so much
    as scratched your finger nothing on earth could save you."</p>

    <p>She paled and drew back in sudden horror. This tiny thing
    had taken the semblance of a snake. A vicious cobra cast at her
    feet would be less alarming, for the reptile could be killed,
    whilst his venomous fangs would only be used in
    self-defence.</p>

    <p>Another tap sounded on their thrice-welcome covering.
    Evidently the Dyaks would persist in their efforts to get one
    of those poisoned darts home.</p>

    <p>Jenks debated silently whether it would be better to create
    a commotion, thus inducing the savages to believe they had
    succeeded in inflicting a mortal wound, or to wait until the
    next arrow fell, rush out, and try conclusions with Dum-dum
    bullets against the sumpitan blowers.</p>

    <p>He decided in favor of the latter course. He wished to
    dishearten his assailants, to cram down their throats the
    belief that he was invulnerable, and could visit their every
    effort with a deadly reprisal.</p>

    <p>Iris, of course, protested when he explained his project.
    But the fighting spirit prevailed. Their love idyll must yield
    to the needs of the hour.</p>

    <p>He had not long to wait. The last arrow fell, and he sprang
    to the extreme right of the ledge. First he looked through that
    invaluable screen of grass. Three Dyaks were on the ground, and
    a fourth in the fork of a tree. They were each armed with a
    blowpipe. He in the tree was just fitting an arrow into the
    bamboo tube. The others were watching him.</p>

    <p>Jenks raised his rifle, fired, and the warrior in the tree
    pitched headlong to the ground. A second shot stretched a
    companion on top of him. One man jumped into the bushes and got
    away, but the fourth tripped over his unwieldy sumpitan and a
    bullet tore a large section from his skull. The sailor then
    amused himself with breaking the bamboos by firing at them. He
    came back to the white-faced girl.</p>

    <p>"I fancy that further practice with blowpipes will be at a
    discount on Rainbow Island," he cried cheerfully.</p>

    <p>But Iris was anxious and distrait.</p>

    <p>"It is very sad," she said, "that we are obliged to secure
    our own safety by the ceaseless slaughter of human beings. Is
    there no offer we can make them, no promise of future gain, to
    tempt them to abandon hostilities?"</p>

    <p>"None whatever. These Borneo Dyaks are bred from infancy to
    prey on their fellow-creatures. To be strangers and defenceless
    is to court pillage and massacre at their hands. I think no
    more of shooting them than of smashing a clay pigeon. Killing a
    mad dog is perhaps a better simile."</p>

    <p>"But, Robert dear, how long can we hold out?"</p>

    <p>"What! Are you growing tired of me already?"</p>

    <p>He hoped to divert her thoughts from this constantly
    recurring topic. Twice within the hour had it been broached and
    dismissed, but Iris would not permit him to shirk it again. She
    made no reply, simply regarding him with a wistful smile.</p>

    <p>So Jenks sat down by her side, and rehearsed the hopes and
    fears which perplexed him. He determined that there should be
    no further concealment between them. If they failed to secure
    water that night, if the Dyaks maintained a strict siege of the
    rock throughout the whole of next day, well&mdash;they might
    survive&mdash;it was problematical. Best leave matters in God's
    hands.</p>

    <p>With feminine persistency she clung to the subject,
    detecting his unwillingness to discuss a possible final stage
    in their sufferings.</p>

    <p>"Robert!" she whispered fearfully, "you will never let me
    fall into the power of the chief, will you?"</p>

    <p>"Not whilst I live."</p>

    <p>"You <i>must</i> live. Don't you understand? I would go with
    them to save you. But I would have died&mdash;by my own hand.
    Robert, my love, you must do this thing before the end. I must
    be the first to die."</p>

    <p>He hung his head in a paroxysm of silent despair. Her words
    rung like a tocsin of the bright romance conjured up by the
    avowal of their love. It seemed to him, in that instant, they
    had no separate existence as distinguished from the great
    stream of human life&mdash;the turbulent river that flowed
    unceasingly from an eternity of the past to an eternity of the
    future. For a day, a year, a decade, two frail bubbles danced
    on the surface and raced joyously together in the sunshine;
    then they were broken&mdash;did it matter how, by savage sword
    or lingering ailment? They vanished&mdash;absorbed again by the
    rushing waters&mdash;and other bubbles rose in precarious
    iridescence. It was a fatalist view of life, a dim and
    obscurantist groping after truth induced by the overpowering
    nature of present difficulties. The famous Tentmaker of
    Naishapur blindly sought the unending purpose when he
    wrote:&mdash;</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The sailor, too, wrestled with the great problem. He may be
    pardoned if his heart quailed and he groaned aloud.</p>

    <p>"Iris," he said solemnly, "whatever happens, unless I am
    struck dead at your feet, I promise you that we shall pass the
    boundary hand in hand. Be mine the punishment if we have
    decided wrongly. And now," he cried, tossing his head in a
    defiant access of energy, "let us have done with the morgue.
    For my part I refuse to acknowledge I am inside until the gates
    clang behind me. As for you, you cannot help yourself. You must
    do as I tell you. I never knew of a case where the question of
    Woman's Rights was so promptly settled."</p>

    <p>His vitality was infectious. Iris smiled again. Her
    sensitive highly strung nerves permitted these sharp
    alternations between despondency and hope.</p>

    <p>"You must remember," he went on, "that the Dyak score is
    twenty-one to the bad, whilst our loss stands at love. Dear me,
    that cannot be right. Love is surely not a loss."</p>

    <p>"A cynic might describe it as a negative gain."</p>

    <p>"Oh, a cynic is no authority. He knows nothing whatever
    about the subject."</p>

    <p>"My father used to say, when he was in Parliament, that
    people who knew least oft-times spoke best. Some men get
    overweighted with facts."</p>

    <p>They chatted in lighter vein with such pendulum swing back
    to nonchalance that none would have deemed it possible for
    these two to have already determined the momentous issue of the
    pending struggle should it go against them. There is, glory be,
    in the Anglo-Saxon race the splendid faculty of meeting death
    with calm defiance, almost with contempt. Moments of panic,
    agonizing memories of bygone days, visions of dear faces never
    to be seen again, may temporarily dethrone this proud
    fortitude. But the tremors pass, the gibbering specters of fear
    and lamentation are thrust aside, and the sons and daughters of
    Great Britain answer the last roll-call with undaunted heroism.
    They know how to die.</p>

    <p>And so the sun sank to rest in the sea, and the star,
    pierced the deepening blue of the celestial arch, whilst the
    man and the woman awaited patiently the verdict of the
    fates.</p>

    <p>Before the light failed, Jenks gathered all the poisoned
    arrows and ground their vemoned points to powder beneath his
    heel. Gladly would Iris and he have dispensed with the friendly
    protection of the tarpaulin when the cool evening breeze came
    from the south. But such a thing might not be even considered.
    Several hours of darkness must elapse before the moon rose, and
    during that period, were their foes so minded, they would be
    absolutely at the mercy of the sumpitan shafts if not covered
    by their impenetrable buckler.</p>

    <p>The sailor looked long and earnestly at the well. Their own
    bucket, improvised out of a dish-cover and a rope, lay close to
    the brink. A stealthy crawl across the sandy valley, half a
    minute of grave danger, and he would be up the ladder again
    with enough water to serve their imperative needs for days to
    come.</p>

    <p>There was little or no risk in descending the rock. Soon
    after sunset it was wrapped in deepest gloom, for night
    succeeds day in the tropics with wondrous speed. The hazard lay
    in twice crossing the white sand, were any of the Dyaks hiding
    behind the house or among the trees.</p>

    <p>He held no foolhardy view of his own powers. The one-sided
    nature of the conflict thus far was due solely to his
    possession of Lee-Metfords as opposed to muzzle-loaders. Let
    him be surrounded on the level at close quarters by a dozen
    determined men and he must surely succumb.</p>

    <p>Were it not for the presence of Iris he would have given no
    second thought to the peril. It was just one of those
    undertakings which a soldier jumps at. "Here goes for the V.C.
    or Kingdom Come!" is the pithy philosophy of Thomas Atkins
    under such circumstances.</p>

    <p>Now, there was no V.C., but there was Iris.</p>

    <p>To act without consulting her was impossible, so they
    discussed the project. Naturally she scouted it.</p>

    <p>"The Mahommedan may be able to help us," she pointed out.
    "In any event let us wait until the moon wanes. That is the
    darkest hour. We do not know what may happen meanwhile."</p>

    <p>The words had hardly left her mouth when an irregular volley
    was fired at them from the right flank of the enemy's position.
    Every bullet struck yards above their heads, the common failing
    of musketry at night being to take too high an aim. But the
    impact of the missiles on a rock so highly impregnated with
    minerals caused sparks to fly, and Jenks saw that the Dyaks
    would obtain by this means a most dangerous index of their
    faulty practice. Telling Iris to at once occupy her safe
    corner, he rapidly adjusted a rifle on the wooden rests already
    prepared in anticipation of an attack from that quarter, and
    fired three shots at the opposing crest, whence came the
    majority of gun-flashes.</p>

    <p>One, at least, of the three found a human billet. There was
    a shout of surprise and pain, and the next volley spurted from
    the ground level. This could do no damage owing to the angle,
    but he endeavored to disconcert the marksmen by keeping up a
    steady fire in their direction. He did not dream of attaining
    other than a moral effect, as there is a lot of room to miss
    when aiming in the dark. Soon he imagined that the burst of
    flame from his rifle helped the Dyaks, because several bullets
    whizzed close to his head, and about this time firing
    recommenced from the crest.</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding all his skill and manipulation of the wooden
    supports, he failed to dislodge the occupants. Every minute one
    or more ounces of lead pitched right into the ledge, damaging
    the stores and tearing the tarpaulin, whilst those which struck
    the wall of rock were dangerous to Iris by reason of the molten
    spray.</p>

    <p>He could guess what had happened. By lying flat on the
    sloping plateau, or squeezing close to the projecting shoulder
    of the cliff, the Dyaks were so little exposed that idle chance
    alone would enable him to hit one of them. But they must be
    shifted, or this night bombardment would prove the most serious
    development yet encountered.</p>

    <p>"Are you all right, Iris?" he called out.</p>

    <p>"Yes, dear," she answered.</p>

    <p>"Well, I want you to keep yourself covered by the canvas for
    a little while&mdash;especially your head and shoulders. I am
    going to stop these chaps. They have found our weak point, but
    I can baffle them."</p>

    <p>She did not ask what he proposed to do. He heard the
    rustling of the tarpaulin as she pulled it. Instantly he cast
    loose the rope-ladder, and, armed only with a revolver, dropped
    down the rock. He was quite invisible to the enemy. On reaching
    the ground he listened for a moment. There was no sound save
    the occasional reports ninety yards away. He hitched up the
    lower rungs of the ladder until they were six feet from the
    level, and then crept noiselessly, close to the rock, for some
    forty yards.</p>

    <p>He halted beside a small poon-tree, and stooped to find
    something embedded near its roots. At this distance he could
    plainly hear the muttered conversation of the Dyaks, and could
    see several of them prone on the sand. The latter fact proved
    how fatal would be an attempt on his part to reach the well.
    They must discover him instantly once he quitted the somber
    shadows of the cliff. He waited, perhaps a few seconds longer
    than was necessary, endeavoring to pierce the dim atmosphere
    and learn something of their disposition.</p>

    <p>A vigorous outburst of firing sent him back with haste. Iris
    was up there alone. He knew not what might happen. He was now
    feverishly anxious to be with her again, to hear her voice, and
    be sure that all was well.</p>

    <p>To his horror he found the ladder swaying gently against the
    rock. Some one was using it. He sprang forward, careless of
    consequence, and seized the swinging end which had fallen free
    again. He had his foot on the bottom rung when Iris's voice,
    close at hand and shrill with terror, shrieked&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Robert, where are you?"</p>

    <p>"Here!" he shouted; the next instant she dropped into his
    arms.</p>

    <p>A startled exclamation from the vicinity of the house, and
    some loud cries from the more distant Dyaks on the other side
    of Prospect Park, showed that they had been overheard.</p>

    <p>"Up!" he whispered. "Hold tight, and go as quickly as you
    can."</p>

    <p>"Not without you!"</p>

    <p>"Up, for God's sake! I follow at your heels."</p>

    <p>She began to climb. He took some article from between his
    teeth, a string apparently, and drew it towards him, mounting
    the ladder at the same time. The end tightened. He was then
    about ten feet from the ground. Two Dyaks, yelling fiercely,
    rushed from the cover of the house.</p>

    <p>"Go on," he said to Iris. "Don't lose your nerve whatever
    happens. I am close behind you."</p>

    <p>"I am quite safe," she gasped.</p>

    <p>Turning, and clinging on with one hand, he drew his revolver
    and fired at the pair beneath, who could now faintly discern
    them, and were almost within reach of the ladder. The shooting
    made them halt. He did not know or care if they were hit. To
    frighten them was sufficient. Several others were running
    across the sands to the cave, attracted by the noise and the
    cries of the foremost pursuers.</p>

    <p>Then he gave a steady pull to the cord. The sharp crack of a
    rifle came from the vicinity of the old quarry. He saw the
    flash among the trees. Almost simultaneously a bright light
    leapt from the opposite ledge, illumining the vicinity like a
    meteor. It lit up the rock, showed Iris just vanishing into the
    safety of the ledge, and revealed Jenks and the Dyaks to each
    other. There followed instantly a tremendous explosion that
    shook earth and air, dislodging every loose stone in the
    south-west pile of rocks, hurling from the plateau some of its
    occupants, and wounding the remainder with a shower of lead and
    d&eacute;bris.</p>

    <p>The island birds, long since driven to the remote trees,
    clamored in raucous peal, and from the Dyaks came yells of
    fright or anguish.</p>

    <p>The sailor, unmolested further, reached the ledge to find
    Iris prostrate where she had fallen, dead or unconscious, he
    knew not which. He felt his face become grey in the darkness.
    With a fierce tug he hauled the ladder well away from the
    ground and sank to his knees beside her.</p>

    <p>He took her into his arms. There was no light. He could not
    see her eyes or lips. Her slight breathing seemed to indicate a
    fainting fit, but there was no water, nor was it possible to
    adopt any of the ordinary expedients suited to such a seizure.
    He could only wait in a dreadful silence&mdash;wait, clasping
    her to his breast&mdash;and dumbly wonder what other loss he
    could suffer ere the final release came.</p>

    <p>At last she sighed deeply. A strong tremor of returning life
    stirred her frame.</p>

    <p>"Thank God!" he murmured, and bowed his head. Were the sun
    shining he could not see her now, for his eyes were
    blurred.</p>

    <p>"Robert!" she whispered.</p>

    <p>"Yes, darling."</p>

    <p>"Are you safe?"</p>

    <p>"Safe! my loved one! Think of yourself! What has happened to
    you?"</p>

    <p>"I fainted&mdash;I think. I have no hurt. I missed you!
    Something told me you had gone. I went to help you, or die with
    you. And then that noise! And the light! What did you do?"</p>

    <p>He silenced her questioning with a passionate kiss. He
    carried her to a little nook and fumbled among the stores until
    he found a bottle of brandy. She drank some. Under its
    revivifying influence she was soon able to listen to the
    explanation he offered&mdash;after securing the ladder.</p>

    <p>In a tall tree near the Valley of Death he had tightly fixed
    a loaded rifle which pointed at a loose stone in the rock
    overhanging the ledge held by the Dyaks. This stone rested
    against a number of percussion caps extracted from cartridges,
    and these were in direct communication with a train of powder
    leading to a blasting charge placed at the end of a twenty-four
    inch hole drilled with a crowbar. The impact of the bullet
    against the stone could not fail to explode some of the caps.
    He had used the contents of three hundred cartridges to secure
    a sufficiency of powder, and the bullets were all crammed into
    the orifice, being tamped with clay and wet sand. The rifle was
    fired by means of the string, the loose coils of which were
    secreted at the foot of the poon. By springing this novel mine
    he had effectually removed every Dyak from the ledge, over
    which its contents would spread like a fan. Further, it would
    probably deter the survivors from again venturing near that
    fatal spot.</p>

    <p>Iris listened, only half comprehending. Her mind was filled
    with one thought to the exclusion of all others. Robert had
    left her, had done this thing without telling her. She forgave
    him, knowing he acted for the best, but he must never, never
    deceive her again in such a manner. She could not bear it.</p>

    <p>What better excuse could man desire for caressing her, yea,
    even squeezing her, until the sobs ceased and she protested
    with a weak little laugh&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Robert, I haven't got much breath&mdash;after that
    excitement&mdash;but please&mdash;leave me&mdash;the
    remains!"</p>
    <hr>
    <a name="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

    <h2>THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS</h2>

    <p>"You are a dear unreasonable little girl," he said. "Have
    you breath enough to tell me why you came down the ladder?"</p>

    <p>"When I discovered you were gone, I became wild with fright.
    Don't you see, I imagined you were wounded and had fallen from
    the ledge. What else could I do but follow, either to help you,
    or, if that were not possible&mdash;"</p>

    <p>He found her hand and pressed it to his lips.</p>

    <p>"I humbly crave your pardon," he said. "That explanation is
    more than ample. It was I who behaved unreasonably. Of course I
    should have warned you. Yet, sweetheart, I ran no risk. The
    real danger passed a week ago."</p>

    <p>"How can that be?"</p>

    <p>"I might have been blown to pieces whilst adjusting the
    heavy stone in front of the caps. I assure you I was glad to
    leave the place that day with a whole skin. If the stone had
    wobbled, or slipped, well&mdash;it was a case of determined
    <i>felo-de-se</i>."</p>

    <p>"May I ask how many more wild adventures you undertook
    without my knowledge?"</p>

    <p>"One other, of great magnitude. I fell in love with
    you."</p>

    <p>"Nonsense!" she retorted. "I knew that long before you
    admitted it to yourself."</p>

    <p>"Date, please?"</p>

    <p>"Well, to begin at the very beginning, you thought I was
    nice on board the <i>Sirdar</i>. Now, didn't you?"</p>

    <p>And they were safely embarked on a conversation of no
    interest to any other person in the wide world, but which
    provided them with the most delightful topic imaginable.</p>

    <p>Thus the time sped until the rising moon silhouetted the
    cliff on the white carpet of coral-strewn sand. The black
    shadow-line traveled slowly closer to the base of the cliff,
    and Jenks, guided also by the stars, told Iris that midnight
    was at hand.</p>

    <p>They knelt on the parapet of the ledge, alert to catch any
    unusual sound, and watching for any indication of human
    movement. But Rainbow Island was now still as the grave. The
    wounded Dyaks had seemingly been removed from hut and beach;
    the dead lay where they had fallen. The sea sang a lullaby to
    the reef, and the fresh breeze whispered among the palm
    fronds&mdash;that was all.</p>

    <p>"Perhaps they have gone!" murmured Iris.</p>

    <p>The sailor put his arm round her neck and gently pressed her
    lips together. Anything would serve as an excuse for that sort
    of thing, but he really did want absolute silence at that
    moment. If the Mussulman kept his compact, the hour was at
    hand.</p>

    <p>An unlooked-for intruder disturbed the quietude of the
    scene. Their old acquaintance, the singing beetle, chortled his
    loud way across the park. Iris was dying&mdash;as women
    say&mdash;to remind Jenks of their first meeting with that
    blatant insect, but further talk was impossible; there was too
    much at stake&mdash;water they must have.</p>

    <p>Then the light hiss of a snake rose to them from the depths.
    That is a sound never forgotten when once heard. It is like
    unto no other. Indeed, the term "hiss" is a misnomer for the
    quick sibilant expulsion of the breath by an alarmed or angered
    serpent.</p>

    <p>Iris paid no heed to it, but Jenks, who knew there was not a
    reptile of the snake variety on the island, leaned over the
    ledge and emitted a tolerably good imitation. The native was
    beneath. Probably the flight of the beetle had helped his
    noiseless approach.</p>

    <p>"Sahib!"</p>

    <p>The girl started at the unexpected call from the depths.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Jenks quietly.</p>

    <p>"A rope, sahib."</p>

    <p>The sailor lowered a rope. Something was tied to it beneath.
    The Mahommedan apparently had little fear of being
    detected.</p>

    <p>"Pull, sahib."</p>

    <p>"Usually it is the sahib who says 'pull,' but circumstances
    alter cases," communed Jenks. He hauled steadily at a heavy
    weight&mdash;a goatskin filled with cold water. He emptied the
    hot and sour wine out of the tin cup, and was about to hand the
    thrice-welcome draught to Iris when a suspicious thought caused
    him to withhold it.</p>

    <p>"Let me taste first," he said.</p>

    <p>The Indian might have betrayed them to the Dyaks. More
    unlikely things had happened. What if the water were poisoned
    or drugged?</p>

    <p>He placed the tin to his lips. The liquid was musty, having
    been in the skin nearly two days. Otherwise it seemed to be all
    right. With a sigh of profound relief he gave Iris the cup, and
    smiled at the most unladylike haste with which she emptied
    it.</p>

    <p>"Drink yourself, and give me some more," she said.</p>

    <p>"No more for you at present, madam. In a few minutes,
    yes."</p>

    <p>"Oh, why not now?"</p>

    <p>"Do not fret, dear one. You can have all you want in a
    little while. But to drink much now would make you very
    ill."</p>

    <p>Iris waited until he could speak again.</p>

    <p>"Why did you&mdash;" she began.</p>

    <p>But he bent over the parapet&mdash;</p>

    <p>"<i>Koi hai</i>!"<a id="footnotetag5"
       name="footnotetag5"></a><a href=
       "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

    <p>"Sahib!"</p>

    <p>"You have not been followed?"</p>

    <p>"I think not, sahib. Do not talk too loud; they are foxes in
    cunning. You have a ladder, they say, sahib. Will not your
    honor descend? I have much to relate."</p>

    <p>Iris made no protest when Jenks explained the man's request.
    She only stipulated that he should not leave the ladder, whilst
    she would remain within easy earshot. The sailor, of course,
    carried his revolver. He also picked up a crowbar, a most
    useful and silent weapon. Then he went quietly downwards.
    Nearing the ground, he saw the native, who salaamed deeply and
    was unarmed. The poor fellow seemed to be very anxious to help
    them.</p>

    <p>"What is your name?" demanded the sailor.</p>

    <p>"Mir Jan, sahib, formerly <i>naik</i><a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href=
       "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> in the Kumaon Rissala."</p>

    <p>"When did you leave the regiment?"</p>

    <p>"Two years ago, sahib. I killed&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"What was the name of your Colonel?"</p>

    <p>"Kurnal I-shpence-sahib, a brave man, but of no account on a
    horse."</p>

    <p>Jenks well remembered Colonel Spence&mdash;a fat,
    short-legged warrior, who rolled off his charger if the animal
    so much as looked sideways. Mir Jan was telling the truth.</p>

    <p>"You are right, Mir Jan. What is Taung S'Ali doing now?"</p>

    <p>"Cursing, sahib, for the most part. His men are frightened.
    He wanted them to try once more with the tubes that shoot
    poison, but they refused. He could not come alone, for he could
    not use his right hand, and he was wounded by the blowing up of
    the rock. You nearly killed me, too, sahib. I was there with
    the bazaar-born whelps. By the Prophet's beard, it was a fine
    stroke."</p>

    <p>"Are they going away, then?"</p>

    <p>"No, sahib. The dogs have been whipped so sore that they
    snarl for revenge. They say there is no use in firing at you,
    but they are resolved to kill you and the miss-sahib, or carry
    her off if she escapes the assault."</p>

    <p>"What assault?"</p>

    <p>"Protector of the poor, they are building
    scaling-ladders&mdash;four in all. Soon after dawn they intend
    to rush your position. You may slay some, they say, but you
    cannot slay three score. Taung S'Ali has promised a gold
    <i>tauk</i><a id="footnotetag7"
       name="footnotetag7"></a><a href=
       "#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> to every man who survives if
       they succeed. They have pulled down your signal on the high
       rocks and are using the poles for the ladders. They think
       you have a <i>jadu</i><a id="footnotetag8"
       name="footnotetag8"></a><a href=
       "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> sahib, and they want to use
       your own work against you."</p>

    <p>This was serious news. A combined attack might indeed be
    dangerous, though it had the excellent feature that if it
    failed the Dyaks would certainly leave the island. But his
    sky-sign destroyed! That was bad. Had a vessel chanced to pass,
    the swinging letters would surely have attracted attention.
    Now, even that faint hope was dispelled.</p>

    <p>"Sahib, there is a worse thing to tell," said Mir Jan.</p>

    <p>"Say on, then."</p>

    <p>"Before they place the ladders against the cliff they will
    build a fire of green wood so that the smoke will be blown by
    the wind into your eyes. This will help to blind your aim.
    Otherwise, you never miss."</p>

    <p>"That will assuredly be awkward, Mir Jan."</p>

    <p>"It will, sahib. Soul of my father, if we had but half a
    troop with us&mdash;"</p>

    <p>But they had not, and they were both so intent on the
    conversation that they were momentarily off their guard. Iris
    was more watchful. She fancied there was a light rustling
    amidst the undergrowth beneath the trees on the right. And she
    could hiss too, if that were the correct thing to do.</p>

    <p>So she hissed.</p>

    <p>Jenks swarmed half way up the ladder.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Iris?" he said.</p>

    <p>"I am not sure, but I imagine something moved among the
    bushes behind the house."</p>

    <p>"All right, dear. I will keep a sharp look-out. Can you hear
    us talking?"</p>

    <p>"Hardly. Will you be long?"</p>

    <p>"Another minute."</p>

    <p>He descended and told Mir Jan what the miss-sahib said. The
    native was about to make a search when Jenks stopped him.</p>

    <p>"Here,"&mdash;he handed the man his revolver&mdash;"I
    suppose you can use this?"</p>

    <p>Mir Jan took it without a word, and Jenks felt that the
    incident atoned for previous unworthy doubts of his dark
    friend's honesty. The Mahommedan cautiously examined the back
    of the house, the neighboring shrubs, and the open beach. After
    a brief absence he reported all safe, yet no man has ever been
    nearer death and escaped it than he during that reconnaissance.
    He, too, forgot that the Dyaks were foxes, and foxes can lie
    close when hounds are a trifle stale.</p>

    <p>Mir Jan returned the revolver.</p>

    <p>"Sahib," he said with another salaam, "I am a disgraced man,
    but if you will take me up there with you, I will fight by your
    side until both my arms are hacked off. I am weary of these
    thieves. Ill chance threw me into their company: I will have no
    more of them. If you will not have me on the rock, give me a
    gun. I will hide among the trees, and I promise that some of
    them shall die to-night before they find me. For the honor of
    the regiment, sahib, do not refuse this thing. All I ask is, if
    your honor escapes, that you will write to Kurnal
    I-shpence-sahib, and tell him the last act of Mir Jan,
    <i>naik</i> in B troop."</p>

    <p>There was an intense pathos in the man's words. He made this
    self-sacrificing offer with an utter absence of any motive save
    the old tradition of duty to the colors. Here was
    Anstruther-sahib, of the Belgaum Rissala, in dire peril. Very
    well, then, Corporal Mir Jan, late of the 19th Bengal Lancers,
    must dare all to save him.</p>

    <p>Jenks was profoundly moved. He reflected how best to utilize
    the services of this willing volunteer without exposing him to
    certain death in the manner suggested. The native
    misinterpreted his silence.</p>

    <p>"I am not a <i>budmash</i>,<a id="footnotetag9"
       name="footnotetag9"></a><a href=
       "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> sahib," he exclaimed proudly.
       "I only killed a man because&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Listen, Mir Jan. You cannot well mend what you have said.
    The Dyaks, you are sure, will not come before morning?"</p>

    <p>"They have carried the wounded to the boats and are making
    the ladders. Such was their talk when I left them."</p>

    <p>"Will they not miss you?"</p>

    <p>"They will miss the <i>mussak</i>,<a id="footnotetag10"
       name="footnotetag10"></a><a href=
       "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a> sahib. It was the last full
       one."</p>

    <p>"Mir Jan, do as I bid, and you shall see Delhi again, Have
    you ever used a Lee-Metford?"</p>

    <p>"I have seen them, sahib; but I better understand the
    Mahtini."</p>

    <p>"I will give you a rifle, with plenty of ammunition, Do you
    go inside the cave, there, and&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Mir Jan was startled.</p>

    <p>"Where the ghost is, sahib?" he said.</p>

    <p>"Ghost! That is a tale for children. There is no ghost, only
    a few bones of a man murdered by these scoundrels long ago.
    Have you any food?"</p>

    <p>"Some rice, sahib; sufficient for a day, or two at a
    pinch."</p>

    <p>"Good! We will get water from the well. When the fighting
    begins at dawn, fire at every man you see from the back of the
    cave. On no account come out. Then they can never reach you if
    you keep a full magazine. Wait here!"</p>

    <p>"I thought you were never coming," protested Iris when Jenks
    reached the ledge. "I have been quite creepy. I am sure there
    is some one down there. And, please, may I have another
    drink?"</p>

    <p>The sailor had left the crowbar beneath. He secured a rifle,
    a spare clip, and a dozen packets of cartridges, meanwhile
    briefly explaining to Iris the turn taken by events so far as
    Mir Jan was concerned. She was naturally delighted, and forgot
    her fears in the excitement caused by the appearance of so
    useful an ally. She drank his health in a brimming beaker of
    water.</p>

    <p>She heard her lover rejoin Mir Jan, and saw the two step out
    into the moonlight, whilst Jenks explained the action of the
    Lee-Metford. Fortunately Iris was now much recovered from the
    fatigue and privation of the earlier hours. Her senses were
    sharpened to a pitch little dreamed of by stay-at-home young
    ladies of her age, and she deemed it her province to act as
    sentry whilst the two men conferred. Hence, she was the first
    to detect, or rather to become conscious of, the stealthy crawl
    of several Dyaks along the bottom of the cliff from Turtle
    Beach. They advanced in Indian file, moving with the utmost
    care, and crouching in the murky shadows like so many wild
    beasts stalking their prey.</p>

    <p>"Robert!" she screamed. "The Dyaks! On your left!"</p>

    <p>But Iris was rapidly gaining some knowledge of strategy.
    Before she shrieked her warning she grasped a rifle. Holding it
    at the "Ready"&mdash;about the level of her waist&mdash;and
    depressing the muzzle sufficiently, she began firing down the
    side of the rock as fast as she could handle lever and trigger.
    Two of the nickel bullets struck a projection and splashed the
    leading savages with molten metal.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately the Lee-Metford beneath was unloaded, being in
    Mir Jan's possession for purposes of instruction. Jenks whipped
    out his revolver.</p>

    <p>"To the cave!" he roared, and Mir Jan's unwillingness to
    face a goblin could not withstand the combined impetus of the
    sahib's order and the onward rush of the enemy. He darted
    headlong for the entrance.</p>

    <p class="figcenter"><a href=
         "images/wm_14_1.png"><img alt="Iris began firing down the side of the rock as fast as she could handle lever and trigger."
         src="images/wm_14_1_th.png"></a></p>

    <p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Iris began firing down
    the side of the rock as fast as she could handle lever and
    trigger.</span></p>

    <p>Jenks, shooting blindly as he, too, ran for the ladder,
    emptied the revolver just as his left hand clutched a rung.
    Three Dyaks were so close that it would be folly to attempt to
    climb. He threw the weapon into the face of the foremost man,
    effectually stopping his onward progress, for the darkness made
    it impossible to dodge the missile.</p>

    <p>The sailor turned to dive into the cave and secure the rifle
    from Mir Jan, when his shin caught the heavy crowbar resting
    against the rock. The pain of the blow lent emphasis to the
    swing with which the implement descended upon some portion of a
    Dyak anatomy. Jenks never knew where he hit the second
    assailant, but the place cracked like an eggshell.</p>

    <p>He had not time to recover the bar for another blow, so he
    gave the point in the gullet of a gentleman who was about to
    make a vicious sweep at him with a parang. The downfall of this
    worthy caused his immediate successor to stumble, and Jenks saw
    his opportunity. With the agility of a cat he jumped up the
    ladder. Once started, he had to go on. He afterwards confessed
    to an unpleasant sensation of pins and needles along his back
    during that brief acrobatic display; but he reached the ledge
    without further injury, save an agonizing twinge when the
    unprotected quick of his damaged finger was smartly rapped
    against the rock.</p>

    <p>These things happened with the speed of thought. Within
    forty seconds of Iris's shrill cry the sailor was breast high
    with the ledge and calling to her&mdash;</p>

    <p>"All right, old girl. Keep it up!"</p>

    <p>The cheerful confidence of his words had a wonderful effect
    on her. Iris, like every good woman, had the maternal instinct
    strong within her&mdash;the instinct that inspires alike the
    mild-eyed Sister of Charity and the tigress fighting for her
    cubs. When Jenks was down below there, in imminent danger of
    being cut to pieces, the gentle, lovable girl, who would not
    willingly hurt the humblest of God's creatures, became
    terrible, majestic in her frenzied purpose. Robert must be
    saved. If a Maxim were planted on the rock she would
    unhesitatingly have turned the lever and sprayed the Dyaks with
    bullets.</p>

    <p>But here he was close to her, unhurt and calmly jubilant, as
    was his way when a stiff fight went well. He was by her side
    now, firing and aiming too, for the Dyaks broke cover
    recklessly in running for shelter, and one may do fair work by
    moonlight, as many a hunter of wild duck can testify by the
    rheumatism in his bones.</p>

    <p>She had strength enough left to place the rifle out of
    harm's way before she broke down and sobbed, not tearfully, but
    in a paroxysm of reaction. Soon all was quiet beneath, save for
    the labored efforts of some wounded men to get far away from
    that accursed rock. Jenks was able to turn to Iris. He
    endeavored to allay her agitation, and succeeded somewhat, for
    tears came, and she clung to him. It was useless to reproach
    him. The whole incident was unforeseen: she was herself a party
    to it. But what an escape!</p>

    <p>He lifted her in his arms and carried her to a seat where
    the tarpaulin rested on a broken water-cask.</p>

    <p>"You have been a very good little girl and have earned your
    supper," he said.</p>

    <p>"Oh, how can you talk so callously after such an awful
    experience?" she expostulated brokenly.</p>

    <p>The Jesuits, say their opponents, teach that at times a
    "white lie" is permissible. Surely this was an instance.</p>

    <p>"It is a small thing to trouble about, sweetheart," he
    explained. "You spotted the enemy so promptly, and blazed away
    with such ferocity, that they never got within yards of
    me."</p>

    <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

    <p>"I vow and declare that after we have eaten something, and
    sampled our remaining bottle of wine, I will tell you exactly
    what happened."</p>

    <p>"Why not now?"</p>

    <p>"Because I must first see to Mir Jan. I bundled him neck and
    crop into the cave. I hope I did not hurt him."</p>

    <p>"You are not going down there again?"</p>

    <p>"No need, I trust."</p>

    <p>He went to the side of the ledge, recovered the ladder which
    he had hastily hauled out of the Dyaks' reach after his climb,
    and cried&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Mir Jan."</p>

    <p>"Ah, sahib! Praised be the name of the Most High, you are
    alive. I was searching among the slain with a sorrowful
    heart."</p>

    <p>The Mahommedan's voice came from some little distance on the
    left.</p>

    <p>"The slain, you say. How many?"</p>

    <p>"Five, sahib."</p>

    <p>"Impossible! I fired blindly with the revolver, and only hit
    one man hard with the iron bar. One other dropped near the wood
    after I obtained a rifle."</p>

    <p>"Then there be six, sahib, not reckoning the wounded. I have
    accounted for one, so the miss-sahib must have&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"What is he saying about me?" inquired Iris, who had risen
    and joined her lover.</p>

    <p>"He says you absolutely staggered the Dyaks by opening fire
    the moment they appeared."</p>

    <p>"How did <i>you</i> come to slay one, Mir Jan?" he
    continued.</p>

    <p>"A son of a black pig followed me into the cave. I waited
    for him in the darkness. I have just thrown his body
    outside."</p>

    <p>"<i>Shabash!</i><a id="footnotetag11"
       name="footnotetag11"></a><a href=
       "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a> Is Taung S'Ali dead, by any
       lucky chance?"</p>

    <p>"No, sahib, if he be not the sixth. I will go and see."</p>

    <p>"You may be attacked?"</p>

    <p>"I have found a sword, sahib. You left me no
    cartridges."</p>

    <p>Jenks told him that the clip and the twelve packets were
    lying at the foot of the rock, where Mir Jan speedily
    discovered them. The Mahommedan gave satisfactory assurance
    that he understood the mechanism of the rifle by filling and
    adjusting the magazine. Then he went to examine the corpse of
    the man who lay in the open near the quarry path.</p>

    <p>The sailor stood in instant readiness to make a counter
    demonstration were the native assailed. But there was no sign
    of the Dyaks. Mir Jan returned with the news that the sixth
    victim of the brief yet fierce encounter was a renegade Malay.
    He was so confident that the enemy had had enough of it for the
    night that, after recovering Jenks's revolver, he boldly went
    to the well and drew himself a supply of water.</p>

    <p>During supper, a feast graced by a quart of champagne worthy
    of the Carlton, Jenks told Iris so much of the story as was
    good for her: that is to say, he cut down the casualty
    list.</p>

    <p>It was easy to see what had happened. The Dyaks, having
    missed the Mahommedan and their water-bag, searched for him and
    heard the conversation at the foot of the rock. Knowing that
    their presence was suspected, they went back for
    reinforcements, and returned by the shorter and more
    advantageous route along Turtle Beach.</p>

    <p>Iris would have talked all night, but Jenks made her go to
    sleep, by pillowing her head against his shoulder and smoothing
    her tangled tresses with his hand. The wine, too, was helpful.
    In a few minutes her voice became dreamy: soon she was sleeping
    like a tired child.</p>

    <p>He managed to lay her on a comfortable pile of ragged
    clothing and then resumed his vigil. Mir Jan offered to mount
    guard beneath, but Jenks bade him go within the cave and remain
    there, for the dawn would soon be upon them.</p>

    <p>Left alone with his thoughts, he wondered what the rising
    sun would bring in its train. He reviewed the events of the
    last twenty-four hours. Iris and he&mdash;Miss Deane, Mr.
    Jenks, to each other&mdash;were then undiscovered in their
    refuge, the Dyaks were gathered around a roaring fire in the
    valley, and Mir Jan was keen in the hunt as the keenest among
    them. Now, Iris was his affianced bride, over twenty of the
    enemy were killed and many wounded, and Mir Jan, a devoted
    adherent, was seated beside the skeleton in the gloom of the
    cavern.</p>

    <p>What a topsy-turvy world it was, to be sure! What
    alternations between despair and hope! What rebound from the
    gates of Death to the threshold of Eden! How untrue, after all,
    was the nebulous philosophy of Omar, the Tentmaker. Surely in
    the happenings of the bygone day there was more than the
    purposeless</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i14">"Magic Shadow-show,</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>He had, indeed, cause to be humbly thankful. Was there not
    One who marked the fall of a sparrow, who clothed the lilies,
    who knew the needs of His creatures? There, in the solemn
    temple of the night, he gave thanks for the protection
    vouchsafed to Iris and himself, and prayed that it might be
    continued. He deplored the useless bloodshed, the horror of
    mangled limbs and festering bodies, that converted this fair
    island into a reeking slaughter-house. Were it possible, by any
    personal sacrifice, to divert the untutored savages from their
    deadly quest, he would gladly condone their misdeeds and
    endeavor to assuage the torments of the wounded.</p>

    <p>But he was utterly helpless, a pawn on that tiny chessboard
    where the game was being played between Civilization and
    Barbarism. The fight must go on to the bitter end: he must
    either vanquish or be vanquished. There were other threads
    being woven into the garment of his life at that moment, but he
    knew not of them. Sufficient for the day was the evil, and the
    good thereof. Of both he had received full measure.</p>

    <p>A period of such reflection could hardly pass without a
    speculative dive into the future. If Iris and he were rescued,
    what would happen when they went forth once more into the busy
    world? Not for one instant did he doubt her faith. She was true
    as steel, knit to him now by bonds of triple brass. But, what
    would Sir Arthur Deane think of his daughter's marriage to a
    discredited and cashiered officer? What was it that poor Mir
    Jan called himself?&mdash;"a disgraced man." Yes, that was it.
    Could that stain be removed? Mir Jan was doing it. Why not
    he?&mdash;by other means, for his good name rested on the word
    of a perjured woman. Wealth was potent, but not all-powerful.
    He would ask Iris to wait until he came to her unsoiled by
    slander, purged of this odium cast upon him unmerited.</p>

    <p>And all this goes to show that he, a man wise beyond his
    fellows, had not yet learned the unwisdom of striving to lift
    the veil of tomorrow, behind whose mystic curtain what is to be
    ever jostles out of place what is hoped for.</p>

    <p>Iris, smiling in her dreams, was assailed by no torturing
    doubts. Robert loved her&mdash;that was enough. Love suffices
    for a woman; a man asks for honor, reputation, an unblemished
    record.</p>

    <p>To awake her he kissed her; he knew not, perchance it might
    be their last kiss on earth. Not yet dawn, there was morning in
    the air, for the first faint shafts of light were not visible
    from their eyrie owing to its position. But there was much to
    be done. If the Dyaks carried out the plan described by Mir
    Jan, he had a good many preparations to make.</p>

    <p>The canvas awning was rolled back and the stores built into
    a barricade intended to shelter Iris.</p>

    <p>"What is that for?" she asked, when she discovered its
    nature. He told her. She definitely refused to avail herself of
    any such protection.</p>

    <p>"Robert dear," she said, "if the attack comes to our very
    door, so to speak, surely I must help you. Even my slight aid
    may stem a rush in one place whilst you are busy in
    another."</p>

    <p>He explained to her that if hand-to-hand fighting were
    necessary he would depend more upon a crowbar than a rifle to
    sweep the ledge clear. She might be in the way.</p>

    <p>"Very well. The moment you tell me to get behind that fence
    I will do so. Even there I can use a revolver."</p>

    <p>That reminded him. His own pistol was unloaded. He possessed
    only five more cartridges of small caliber. He placed them in
    the weapon and gave it to her.</p>

    <p>"Now you have eleven men's lives in your hands," he said.
    "Try not to miss if you must shoot."</p>

    <p>In the dim light he could not see the spasm of pain that
    clouded her face. No Dyak would reach her whilst he lived. If
    he fell, there was another use for one of those cartridges.</p>

    <p>The sailor had cleared the main floor of the rock and was
    placing his four rifles and other implements within easy reach
    when a hiss came from beneath.</p>

    <p>"Mir Jan!" exclaimed Iris.</p>

    <p>"What now?" demanded Jenks over the side.</p>

    <p>"Sahib, they come!"</p>

    <p>"I am prepared. Let that snake get back to his hole in the
    rock, lest a mongoose seize him by the head."</p>

    <p>Mir Jan, engaged in a scouting expedition on his own
    account, understood that the officer-sahib's orders must be
    obeyed. He vanished. Soon they heard a great crackling among
    the bushes on the right, but Jenks knew even before he looked
    that the Dyaks had correctly estimated the extent of his fire
    zone and would keep out of it.</p>

    <p>The first physical intimation of the enemy's design they
    received was a pungent but pleasant smell of burning pine,
    borne to them by the northerly breeze and filling the air with
    its aroma. The Dyaks kindled a huge fire. The heat was
    perceptible even on the ledge, but the minutes passed, and the
    dawn broadened into day without any other result being
    achieved.</p>

    <p>Iris, a little drawn and pale with suspense, said with a
    timid giggle&mdash;</p>

    <p>"This does not seem to be so very serious. It reminds me of
    my efforts to cook."</p>

    <p>"There is more to follow, I fear, dear one. But the Dyaks
    are fools. They should have waited until night fell again,
    after wearing us out by constant vigilance all day. If they
    intend to employ smoke it would be far worse for us at
    night."</p>

    <p>Phew! A volume of murky vapor arose that nearly suffocated
    them by the first whiff of its noisome fumes. It curled like a
    black pall over the face of the rock and blotted out sea and
    sky. They coughed incessantly, and nearly choked, for the Dyaks
    had thrown wet seaweed on top of the burning pile of dry wood.
    Mir Jan, born in interior India, knew little about the sea or
    its products, and when the savages talked of seaweed he thought
    they meant green wood. Fortunately for him, the ascending
    clouds of smoke missed the cave, or infallibly he must have
    been stifled.</p>

    <p>"Lie flat on the rock!" gasped Jenks. Careless of waste, he
    poured water over a coat and made Iris bury her mouth and nose
    in the wet cloth. This gave her immediate relief, and she
    showed her woman's wit by tying the sleeves of the garment
    behind her neck. Jenks nodded comprehension and followed her
    example, for by this means their hands were left free.</p>

    <p>The black cloud grew more dense each few seconds.
    Nevertheless, owing to the slope of the ledge, and the tendency
    of the smoke to rise, the south side was far more tenable than
    the north. Quick to note this favorable circumstance, the
    sailor deduced a further fact from it. A barrier erected on the
    extreme right of the ledge would be a material gain. He sprang
    up, dragged the huge tarpaulin from its former location, and
    propped it on the handle of the pickaxe, driven by one mighty
    stroke deep into a crevice of the rock.</p>

    <p>It was no mean feat of strength that he performed. He swung
    the heavy and cumbrous canvas into position as if it were a
    dust cloth. He emerged from the gloom of the driven cloud
    red-eyed but triumphant. Instantly the vapor on the ledge
    lessened, and they could breathe, even talk. Overhead and in
    front the smoke swept in ever-increasing density, but once
    again the sailor had outwitted the Dyaks' manoeuvres.</p>

    <p>"We have won the first rubber," he whispered to Iris.</p>

    <p>Above, beneath, beyond, they could see nothing. The air they
    breathed was hot and foetid. It was like being immured in a
    foul tunnel and almost as dark. Jenks looked over the parapet.
    He thought he could distinguish some vague figures on the
    sands, so he fired at them. A volley of answering bullets
    crashed into the rock on all sides. The Dyaks had laid their
    plans well this time. A firing squad stationed beyond the smoke
    area, and supplied with all the available guns, commenced and
    kept up a smart fusillade in the direction of the ledge in
    order to cover the operations of the scaling party.</p>

    <p>Jenks realized that to expose himself was to court a serious
    wound and achieve no useful purpose. He fell back out of range,
    laid down his rifle and grabbed the crowbar. At brief intervals
    a deep hollow boom came up from the valley. At first it puzzled
    them until the sailor hit upon an explanation. Mir Jan was
    busy.</p>

    <p>The end of a strong roughly made ladder swung through the
    smoke and banged against the ledge. Before Jenks could reach it
    those hoisting it into position hastily retreated. They were
    standing in front of the cave and the Mahommedan made play on
    them with a Lee-Metford at thirty feet.</p>

    <p>Jenks, using his crowbar as a lever, toppled the ladder
    clean over. It fell outwards and disconcerted a section of the
    musketeers.</p>

    <p>"Well done," cried Iris.</p>

    <p>The sailor, astounded by her tone, gave her a fleeting
    glance. She was very pale now, but not with fear. Her eyes were
    slightly contracted, her nostrils quivering, her lips set tight
    and her chin dimpled. She had gone back thirty generations in
    as many seconds. Thus might one of the daughters of Boadicea
    have looked whilst guiding her mother's chariot against the
    Roman phalanx. Resting on one knee, with a revolver in each
    hand, she seemed no puling mate for the gallant man who fought
    for her.</p>

    <p>She caught his look.</p>

    <p>"We will beat them yet!" she cried again, and she smiled,
    not as a woman smiles, but with the joy of a warrior when the
    fray is toward.</p>

    <p>There was no time for further speech. Three ladders were
    reared against the rock. They were so poised and held below
    that Jenks could not force them backwards. A fourth appeared,
    its coarse shafts looming into sight like the horns of some
    gigantic animal. The four covered practically the whole front
    of the ledge save where Mir Jan cleared a little space on the
    level.</p>

    <p>The sailor was standing now, with the crowbar clenched in
    both hands. The firing in the valley slackened and died away. A
    Dyak face, grinning like a Japanese demon, appeared at the top
    of the ladder nearest to Iris.</p>

    <p>"Don't fire!" shouted Jenks, and the iron bar crushed
    downwards. Two others pitched themselves half on to the ledge.
    Now both crowbar and revolver were needed. Three ladders were
    thus cumbered somewhat for those beneath, and Jenks sprang
    towards the fourth and most distant. Men were crowding it like
    ants. Close to his feet lay an empty water-cask. It was a crude
    weapon, but effective when well pitched, and the sailor had
    never made a better shot for a goal in the midst of a
    hard-fought scrimmage than he made with that tub for the head
    of the uppermost pirate.</p>

    <p>Another volley came from the sands. A bullet ploughed
    through his hair, and sent his sou'wester flying. Again the
    besiegers swarmed to the attack. One way or the other, they
    must succeed. A man and a woman&mdash;even such a man and such
    a woman&mdash;could not keep at bay an infuriated horde of
    fifty savages fighting at close quarters and under these
    grievous conditions.</p>

    <p>Jenks knew what would happen. He would be shot in the head
    or breast whilst repelling the scaling party. And Iris! Dear
    heart! She was thinking of him.</p>

    <p>"Keep back! They can never gain the ledge!" she
    shrieked.</p>

    <p>And then, above the din of the fusillade, the yells of the
    assailants and the bawling of the wounded, there came through
    the air a screaming, tearing, ripping sound which drowned all
    others. It traveled with incredible speed, and before the
    sailor could believe his ears&mdash;for he well knew what it
    meant&mdash;a shrapnel shell burst in front of the ledge and
    drenched the valley with flying lead.</p>

    <p>Jenks was just able to drag Iris flat against the rock ere
    the time fuse operated and the bullets flew. He could form no
    theory, hazard no conjecture. All he knew was that a 12-pounder
    shell had flown towards them through space, scattering red ruin
    among the amazed scoundrels beneath. Instantly he rose again,
    lest perchance any of the Dyaks should have gained a foothold
    on the ledge.</p>

    <p>The ladders were empty. He could hear a good deal of
    groaning, the footsteps of running men, and some distant
    shouting.</p>

    <p>"Sahib!" yelled Mir Jan, drawn from his retreat by the
    commotion without.</p>

    <p>"Yes," shouted Jenks.</p>

    <p>The native, in a voice cracked with excitement, told him
    something. The sailor asked a few rapid questions to make quite
    sure that Mir Jan was not mistaken.</p>

    <p>Then he threw his arms round Iris, drew her close and
    whispered&mdash;</p>

    <p>"My darling, we are saved! A warship has anchored just
    beyond the south reef, and two boats filled with armed sailors
    are now pulling ashore."</p>

    <p>And she answered proudly&mdash;</p>

    <p>"The Dyaks could never have conquered us, Robert. We were
    manifestly under God's protection. Oh, my love, my love, I am
    so happy and thankful!"</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

    <h2>THE DIFFICULTY OF PLEASING EVERYBODY</h2>

    <p>The drifting smoke was still so dense that not even the
    floor of the valley could be discerned. Jenks dared not leave
    Iris at such a moment. He feared to bring her down the ladder
    lest another shell might be fired. But something must be done
    to end their suspense.</p>

    <p>He called to Mir Jan&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Take off your turban and hold it above your head, if you
    think they can see you from the warship."</p>

    <p>"It is all right, sahib," came the cheering answer. "One
    boat is close inshore. I think, from the uniforms, they are
    English sahibs, such as I have seen at Garden Reach. The Dyaks
    have all gone."</p>

    <p>Nevertheless Jenks waited. There was nothing to gain by
    being too precipitate. A false step now might undo the
    achievements of many weeks.</p>

    <p>Mir Jan was dancing about beneath in a state of wild
    excitement.</p>

    <p>"They have seen the Dyaks running to their sampans, sahib,"
    he yelled, "and the second boat is being pulled in that
    direction. Yet another has just left the ship."</p>

    <p>A translation made Iris excited, eager to go down and see
    these wonders.</p>

    <p>"Better wait here, dearest," he said. "The enemy may be
    driven back in this direction, and I cannot expose you to
    further risk. The sailors will soon land, and you can then
    descend in perfect safety."</p>

    <p>The boom of a cannon came from the sea. Instinctively the
    girl ducked for safety, though her companion smiled at her
    fears, for the shell would have long preceded the report, had
    it traveled their way.</p>

    <p>"One of the remaining sampans has got under way," he
    explained, "and the warship is firing at her."</p>

    <p>Two more guns were fired. The man-o'-war evidently meant
    business.</p>

    <p>"Poor wretches!" murmured Iris. "Cannot the survivors be
    allowed to escape?"</p>

    <p>"Well, we are unable to interfere. Those caught on the
    island will probably be taken to the mainland and hanged for
    their crimes, so the manner of their end is not of much
    consequence."</p>

    <p>To the girl's manifest relief there was no more firing, and
    Mir Jan announced that a number of sailors were actually on
    shore. Then her thoughts turned to a matter of concern to the
    feminine mind even in the gravest moments of existence. She
    laved her face with water and sought her discarded skirt!</p>

    <p>Soon the steady tramp of boot-clad feet advancing at the
    double was heard on the shingle, and an officer's voice,
    speaking the crude Hindustani of the engine-room and
    forecastle, shouted to Mir Jan&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Hi, you black fellow! Are there any white people here?"</p>

    <p>Jenks sang out&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Yes, two of us! Perched on the rock over your heads. We are
    coming down."</p>

    <p>He cast loose the rope-ladder. Iris was limp and
    trembling.</p>

    <p>"Steady, sweetheart," he whispered. "Don't forget the slip
    between the cup and the lip. Hold tight! But have no fear! I
    will be just beneath."</p>

    <p>It was well he took this precaution. She was now so unnerved
    that an unguarded movement might have led to an accident. But
    the knowledge that her lover was near, the touch of his hand
    guiding her feet on to the rungs of the ladder, sustained her.
    They had almost reached the level when a loud exclamation and
    the crash of a heavy blow caused Jenks to halt and look
    downwards.</p>

    <p>A Dyak, lying at the foot of one of the scaling ladders, and
    severely wounded by a shell splinter, witnessed their descent.
    In his left hand he grasped a parang; his right arm was
    bandaged. Though unable to rise, the vengeful pirate mustered
    his remaining strength to crawl towards the swaying ladder. It
    was Taung S'Ali, inspired with the hate and venom of the dying
    snake. Even yet he hoped to deal a mortal stroke at the man who
    had defied him and all his cut-throat band. He might have
    succeeded, as Jenks was so taken up with Iris, were it not for
    the watchful eyes of Mir Jan. The Mahommedan sprang at him with
    an oath, and gave him such a murderous whack with the butt of a
    rifle that the Dyak chief collapsed and breathed out his fierce
    spirit in a groan.</p>

    <p>At the first glance Jenks did not recognize Taung S'Ali,
    owing to his change of costume. Through the thinner smoke he
    could see several sailors running up.</p>

    <p>"Look out, there!" he cried. "There is a lady here. If any
    Dyak moves, knock him on the head!"</p>

    <p>But, with the passing of the chief, their last peril had
    gone. The next instant they were standing on the firm ground,
    and a British naval lieutenant was saying eagerly&mdash;</p>

    <p>"We seem to have turned up in the nick of time. Do you, by
    any chance, belong to the <i>Sirdar</i>?"</p>

    <p>"We are the sole survivors," answered the sailor.</p>

    <p>"You two only?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. She struck on the north-west reef of this island
    during a typhoon. This lady, Miss Iris Deane, and I were flung
    ashore&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Miss Deane! Can it be possible? Let me congratulate you
    most heartily. Sir Arthur Deane is on board the <i>Orient</i>
    at this moment."</p>

    <p>"The <i>Orient</i>!"</p>

    <p>Iris was dazed. The uniforms, the pleasant faces of the
    English sailors, the strange sensation of hearing familiar
    words in tones other than those of the man she loved,
    bewildered her.</p>

    <p>"Yes," explained the officer, with a sympathetic smile.
    "That's our ship, you know, in the offing there."</p>

    <p>It was all too wonderful to be quite understood yet. She
    turned to Robert&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Do you hear? They say my father is not far away. Take me to
    him."</p>

    <p class="figcenter"><a href=
         "images/wm_15_1.png"><img alt="'We are the sole survivors,' answered the sailor."
         src="images/wm_15_1_th.png"></a></p>

    <p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">"We are the sole
    survivors," answered the sailor.</span></p>

    <p>"No need for that, miss," interrupted a warrant officer.
    "Here he is coming ashore. He wanted to come with us, but the
    captain would not permit it, as there seemed to be some trouble
    ahead."</p>

    <p>Sure enough, even the girl's swimming eyes could distinguish
    the grey-bearded civilian seated beside an officer in the
    stern-sheets of a small gig now threading a path through the
    broken reef beyond Turtle Beach. In five minutes, father and
    daughter would meet.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the officer, intent on duty, addressed Jenks
    again.</p>

    <p>"May I ask who you are?"</p>

    <p>"My name is Anstruther&mdash;Robert Anstruther."</p>

    <p>Iris, clinging to his arm, heard the reply.</p>

    <p>So he had abandoned all pretence. He was ready to face the
    world at her side. She stole a loving glance at him as she
    cried&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Yes, Captain Anstruther, of the Indian Staff Corps. If he
    will not tell you all that he has done, how he has saved my
    life twenty times, how he has fought single-handed against
    eighty men, ask me!"</p>

    <p>The naval officer did not need to look a second time at
    Iris's face to lengthen the list of Captain Anstruther's
    achievements, by one more item. He sighed. A good sailor always
    does sigh when a particularly pretty girl is labeled
    "Engaged."</p>

    <p>But he could be very polite.</p>

    <p>"Captain Anstruther does not appear to have left much for us
    to do, Miss Deane," he said. "Indeed," turning to Robert, "is
    there any way in which my men will be useful?"</p>

    <p>"I would recommend that they drag the green stuff off that
    fire and stop the smoke. Then, a detachment should go round the
    north side of the island and drive the remaining Dyaks into the
    hands of the party you have landed, as I understand, at the
    further end of the south beach. Mir Jan, the Mahommedan here,
    who has been a most faithful ally during part of our siege,
    will act as guide."</p>

    <p>The other man cast a comprehensive glance over the rock,
    with its scaling ladders and dangling rope-ladder, the cave,
    the little groups of dead or unconscious pirates&mdash;for
    every wounded man who could move a limb had crawled away after
    the first shell burst&mdash;and drew a deep breath.</p>

    <p>"How long were you up there?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"Over thirty hours."</p>

    <p>"It was a great fight!"</p>

    <p>"Somewhat worse than it looks," said Anstruther. "This is
    only the end of it. Altogether, we have accounted for nearly
    two score of the poor devils."</p>

    <p>"Do you think you can make them prisoners, without killing
    any more of them?" asked Iris.</p>

    <p>"That depends entirely on themselves, Miss Deane. My men
    will not fire a shot unless they encounter resistance."</p>

    <p>Robert looked towards the approaching boat. She would not
    land yet for a couple of minutes.</p>

    <p>"By the way," he said, "will you tell me your name?"</p>

    <p>"Playdon&mdash;Lieutenant Philip H. Playdon."</p>

    <p>"Do you know to what nation this island belongs?"</p>

    <p>"It is no-man's land, I think. It is marked 'uninhabited' on
    the chart."</p>

    <p>"Then," said Anstruther, "I call upon you, Lieutenant
    Playdon, and all others here present, to witness that I, Robert
    Anstruther, late of the Indian Army, acting on behalf of myself
    and Miss Iris Deane, declare that we have taken possession of
    this island in the name of His Britannic Majesty the King of
    England, that we are the joint occupiers and owners thereof,
    and claim all property rights vested therein."</p>

    <p>These formal phrases, coming at such a moment, amazed his
    hearers. Iris alone had an inkling of the underlying
    motive.</p>

    <p>"I don't suppose any one will dispute your title," said the
    naval officer gravely. He unquestionably imagined that
    suffering and exposure had slightly disturbed the other man's
    senses, yet he had seldom seen any person who looked to be in
    more complete possession of his faculties.</p>

    <p>"Thank you," replied Robert with equal composure, though he
    felt inclined to laugh at Playdon's mystification. "I only
    wished to secure a sufficient number of witnesses for a verbal
    declaration. When I have a few minutes to spare I will affix a
    legal notice on the wall in front of our cave."</p>

    <p>Playdon bowed silently. There was something in the speaker's
    manner that puzzled him. He detailed a small guard to accompany
    Robert and Iris, who now walked towards the beach, and asked
    Mir Jan to pilot him as suggested by Anstruther.</p>

    <p>The boat was yet many yards from shore when Iris ran forward
    and stretched out her arms to the man who was staring at her
    with wistful despair.</p>

    <p>"Father! Father!" she cried. "Don't you know me?"</p>

    <p>Sir Arthur Deane was looking at the two strange figures on
    the sands, and each moment his heart sank lower. This island
    held his final hope. During many weary weeks, since the day
    when a kindly Admiral placed the cruiser <i>Orient</i> at his
    disposal, he had scoured the China Sea, the coasts of Borneo
    and Java, for some tidings of the ill-fated <i>Sirdar</i>.</p>

    <p>He met naught save blank nothingness, the silence of the
    great ocean mausoleum. Not a boat, a spar, a lifebuoy, was cast
    up by the waves to yield faintest trace of the lost steamer.
    Every naval man knew what had happened. The vessel had met with
    some mishap to her machinery, struck a derelict, or turned
    turtle, during that memorable typhoon of March 17 and 18. She
    had gone down with all hands. Her fate was a foregone
    conclusion. No ship's boat could live in that sea, even if the
    crew were able to launch one. It was another of ocean's
    tragedies, with the fifth act left to the imagination.</p>

    <p>To examine every sand patch and tree-covered shoal in the
    China Sea was an impossible task. All the <i>Orient</i> could
    do was to visit the principal islands and institute inquiries
    among the fishermen and small traders. At last, the previous
    night, a Malay, tempted by hope of reward, boarded the vessel
    when lying at anchor off the large island away to the south,
    and told the captain a wondrous tale of a devil-haunted place
    inhabited by two white spirits, a male and a female, whither a
    local pirate named Taung S'Ali had gone by chance with his men
    and suffered great loss. But Taung S'Ali was bewitched by the
    female spirit, and had returned there, with a great force,
    swearing to capture her or perish. The spirits, the Malay said,
    had dwelt upon the island for many years. His father and
    grandfather knew the place and feared it. Taung S'Ali would
    never be seen again.</p>

    <p>This queer yarn was the first indication they received of
    the whereabouts of any persons who might possibly be
    shipwrecked Europeans, though not survivors from the
    <i>Sirdar</i>. Anyhow, the tiny dot lay in the vessel's
    northward track, so a course was set to arrive off the island
    soon after dawn.</p>

    <p>Events on shore, as seen by the officer on watch, told their
    own tale. Wherever Dyaks are fighting there is mischief on
    foot, so the <i>Orient</i> took a hand in the proceedings.</p>

    <p>But Sir Arthur Deane, after an agonized scrutiny of the
    weird-looking persons escorted by the sailors to the water's
    edge, sadly acknowledged that neither of these could be the
    daughter whom he sought. He bowed his head in humble
    resignation, and he thought he was the victim of a cruel
    hallucination when Iris's tremulous accents reached his
    ears&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Father, father! Don't you know me?"</p>

    <p>He stood up, amazed and trembling.</p>

    <p>"Yes, father dear. It is I, your own little girl given back
    to you. Oh dear! Oh dear! I cannot see you for my tears."</p>

    <p>They had some difficulty to keep him in the boat, and the
    man pulling stroke smashed a stout oar with the next
    wrench.</p>

    <p>And so they met at last, and the sailors left them alone, to
    crowd round Anstruther and ply him with a hundred questions.
    Although he fell in with their humor, and gradually pieced
    together the stirring story which was supplemented each instant
    by the arrival of disconsolate Dyaks and the comments of the
    men who returned from cave and beach, his soul was filled with
    the sight of Iris and her father, and the happy, inconsequent
    demands with which each sought to ascertain and relieve the
    extent of the other's anxiety.</p>

    <p>Then Iris called to him&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Robert, I want you."</p>

    <p>The use of his Christian name created something akin to a
    sensation. Sir Arthur Deane was startled, even in his
    immeasurable delight at finding his child uninjured&mdash;the
    picture of rude health and happiness.</p>

    <p>Anstruther advanced.</p>

    <p>"This is my father," she cried, shrill with joy. "And,
    father darling, this is Captain Robert Anstruther, to whom
    alone, under God's will, I owe my life, many, many times since
    the moment the <i>Sirdar</i> was lost."</p>

    <p>It was no time for questioning. Sir Arthur Deane took off
    his hat and held out his hand&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Captain Anstruther," he said, "as I owe you my daughter's
    life, I owe you that which I can never repay. And I owe you my
    own life, too, for I could not have survived the knowledge that
    she was dead."</p>

    <p>Robert took the proffered hand&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I think, Sir Arthur, that, of the two, I am the more deeply
    indebted. There are some privileges whose value cannot be
    measured, and among them the privilege of restoring your
    daughter to your arms takes the highest place."</p>

    <p>Then, being much more self-possessed than the older man, who
    was naturally in a state of agitation that was almost painful,
    he turned to Iris.</p>

    <p>"I think," he said, "that your father should take you on
    board the <i>Orient</i>, Iris. There you may, perhaps, find
    some suitable clothing, eat something, and recover from the
    exciting events of the morning. Afterwards, you must bring Sir
    Arthur ashore again, and we will guide him over the island. I
    am sure you will find much to tell him meanwhile."</p>

    <p>The baronet could not fail to note the manner in which these
    two addressed each other, the fearless love which leaped from
    eye to eye, the calm acceptance of a relationship not be
    questioned or gainsaid. Robert and Iris, without spoken word on
    the subject, had tactily agreed to avoid the slightest
    semblance of subterfuge as unworthy alike of their achievements
    and their love. Yet what could Sir Arthur Deane do? To frame a
    suitable protest at such a moment was not to be dreamed of. As
    yet he was too shaken to collect his thoughts. Anstruther's
    proposal, however, helped him to blurt out what he intuitively
    felt to be a disagreeable fact. Yet something must be said, for
    his brain reeled.</p>

    <p>"Your suggestion is admirable," he cried, striving
    desperately to affect a careless complaisance. "The ship's
    stores may provide Iris with some sort of rig-out, and an old
    friend of hers is on board at this moment, little expecting her
    presence. Lord Ventnor has accompanied me in my search. He
    will, of course, be delighted&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Anstruther flushed a deep bronze, but Iris broke
    in&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Father, why did <i>he</i> come with you?"</p>

    <p>Sir Arthur, driven into this sudden squall of explanation,
    became dignified.</p>

    <p>"Well, you see, my dear, under the circumstances, he felt an
    anxiety almost commensurate with my own."</p>

    <p>"But why, why?"</p>

    <p>Iris was quite calm. With Robert near, she was courageous.
    Even the perturbed baronet experienced a new sensation as his
    troubled glance fell before her searching eyes. His daughter
    had left him a joyous, heedless girl. He found her a woman,
    strong, self-reliant, purposeful. Yet he kept on, choosing the
    most straightforward means as the only honorable way of
    clearing a course so beset with unsuspected obstacles.</p>

    <p>"It is only reasonable, Iris, that your affianced husband
    should suffer an agony of apprehension on your account, and do
    all that was possible to effect your rescue."</p>

    <p>"My&mdash;affianced&mdash;husband?"</p>

    <p>"Well, my dear girl, perhaps that is hardly the correct
    phrase from your point of view. Yet you cannot fail to remember
    that Lord Ventnor&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Father, dear," said Iris solemnly, but in a voice free from
    all uncertainty, "my affianced husband stands here! We plighted
    our troth at the very gate of death. It was ratified in the
    presence of God, and has been blessed by Him. I have made no
    compact with Lord Ventnor. He is a base and unworthy man. Did
    you but know the truth concerning him you would not mention his
    name in the same breath with mine. Would he, Robert?"</p>

    <p>Never was man so perplexed as the unfortunate shipowner. In
    the instant that his beloved daughter was restored to him out
    of the very depths of the sea, he was asked either to undertake
    the r&ocirc;le of a disappointed and unforgiving parent, or
    sanction her marriage to a truculent-looking person of most
    forbidding if otherwise manly appearance, who had certainly
    saved her from death in ways not presently clear to him, but
    who could not be regarded as a suitable son-in-law solely on
    that account.</p>

    <p>What could he do, what could he say, to make the position
    less intolerable?</p>

    <p>Anstruther, quicker than Iris to appreciate Sir Arthur
    Deane's dilemma, gallantly helped him. He placed a loving hand
    on the girl's shoulder.</p>

    <p>"Be advised by me, Sir Arthur, and you too, Iris," he said.
    "This is no hour for such explanations. Leave me to deal with
    Lord Ventnor. I am content to trust the ultimate verdict to
    you, Sir Arthur. You will learn in due course all that has
    happened. Go on board, Iris. Meet Lord Ventnor as you would
    meet any other friend. You will not marry him, I know. I can
    trust you." He said this with a smile that robbed the words of
    serious purport. "Believe me, you two can find plenty to occupy
    your minds today without troubling yourselves about Lord
    Ventnor."</p>

    <p>"I am very much obliged to you," murmured the baronet, who,
    notwithstanding his worry, was far too experienced a man of the
    world not to acknowledge the good sense of this advice, no
    matter how ruffianly might be the guise of the strange person
    who gave it.</p>

    <p>"That is settled, then," said Robert, laughing
    good-naturedly, for he well knew what a weird spectacle he must
    present to the bewildered old gentleman.</p>

    <p>Even Sir Arthur Deane was fascinated by the ragged and hairy
    giant who carried himself so masterfully and helped everybody
    over the stile at the right moment He tried to develop the
    change in the conversation.</p>

    <p>"By the way," he said, "how came you to be on the
    <i>Sirdar</i>? I have a list of all the passengers and crew,
    and your name does not appear therein."</p>

    <p>"Oh, that is easily accounted for. I shipped as a steward,
    in the name of Robert Jenks."</p>

    <p>"Robert Jenks! A steward!"</p>

    <p>This was worse than ever. The unhappy shipowner thought the
    sky must have fallen.</p>

    <p>"Yes. That forms some part of the promised explanation."</p>

    <p>Iris rapidly gathered the drift of her lover's wishes.
    "Come, father," she cried merrily. "I am aching to see what the
    ship's stores, which you and Robert pin your faith to, can do
    for me in the shape of garments. I have the utmost belief in
    the British navy, and even a skeptic should be convinced of its
    infallibility if H.M.S. <i>Orient</i> is able to provide a
    lady's outfit."</p>

    <p>Sir Arthur Deane gladly availed himself of the proffered
    compromise. He assisted Iris into the boat, though that active
    young person was far better able to support him, and a word to
    the officer in command sent the gig flying back to the ship.
    Anstruther, during a momentary delay, made a small request on
    his own account. Lieutenant Playdon, nearly as big a man as
    Robert, despatched a note to his servant, and the gig speedily
    returned with a complete assortment of clothing and linen. The
    man also brought a dressing case, with the result that a dip in
    the bath, and ten minutes in the hands of an expert valet, made
    Anstruther a new man.</p>

    <p>Acting under his advice, the bodies of the dead were thrown
    into the lagoon, the wounded were collected in the hut to be
    attended to by the ship's surgeon, and the prisoners were
    paraded in front of Mir Jan, who identified every man, and
    found, by counting heads, that none was missing.</p>

    <p>Robert did not forget to write out a formal notice and
    fasten it to the rock. This proceeding further mystified the
    officers of the <i>Orient</i>, who had gradually formed a
    connected idea of the great fight made by the shipwrecked pair,
    though Anstruther squirmed inwardly when he thought of the
    manner in which Iris would picture the scene. As it was, he had
    the first innings, and he did not fail to use the opportunity.
    In the few terse words which the militant Briton best
    understands, he described the girl's fortitude, her unflagging
    cheerfulness, her uncomplaining readiness to do and dare.</p>

    <p>Little was said by his auditors, save to interpolate an
    occasional question as to why such and such a thing was
    necessary, or how some particular drawback had been surmounted.
    Standing near the well, it was not necessary to move to explain
    to them the chief features of the island, and point out the
    measures he had adopted.</p>

    <p>When he ended, the first lieutenant, who commanded the boats
    sent in pursuit of the flying Dyaks&mdash;the <i>Orient</i>
    sank both sampans as soon as they were launched&mdash;summed up
    the general verdict&mdash;</p>

    <p>"You do not need our admiration, Captain Anstruther. Each
    man of us envies you from the bottom of his soul."</p>

    <p>"I do, I know&mdash;from the very bilge," exclaimed a stout
    midshipman, one of those who had seen Iris.</p>

    <p>Robert waited until the laugh died away.</p>

    <p>"There is an error about my rank," he said. "I did once hold
    a commission in the Indian army, but I was court-marshaled and
    cashiered in Hong Kong six months ago. I was unjustly convicted
    on a grave charge, and I hope some day to clear myself.
    Meanwhile I am a mere civilian. It was only Miss Deane's
    generous sympathy which led her to mention my former rank, Mr.
    Playdon."</p>

    <p>Had another of the <i>Orient's</i> 12-pounder shells
    suddenly burst in the midst of the group of officers, it would
    have created less dismay than this unexpected avowal.
    Court-martialed! Cashiered! None but a service man can grasp
    the awful significance of those words to the commissioned ranks
    of the army and navy.</p>

    <p>Anstruther well knew what he was doing. Somehow, he found
    nothing hard in the performance of these penances now. Of
    course, the ugly truth must be revealed the moment Lord Ventnor
    heard his name. It was not fair to the good fellows crowding
    around him, and offering every attention that the frank
    hospitality of the British sailor could suggest, to permit them
    to adopt the tone of friendly equality which rigid discipline,
    if nothing else, would not allow them to maintain.</p>

    <p>The first lieutenant, by reason of his rank, was compelled
    to say something&mdash;</p>

    <p>"That is a devilish bad job, Mr. Anstruther," he blurted
    out.</p>

    <p>"Well, you know, I had to tell you."</p>

    <p>He smiled unaffectedly at the wondering circle. He, too, was
    an officer, and appreciated their sentiments. They were
    unfeignedly sorry for him, a man so brave and modest, such a
    splendid type of the soldier and gentleman, yet, by their
    common law, an outcast. Nor could they wholly understand his
    demeanor. There was a noble dignity in his candor, a conscious
    innocence that disdained to shield itself under a partial
    truth. He spoke, not as a wrong-doer, but as one who addresses
    those who have been and will be once more his peers.</p>

    <p>The first lieutenant again phrased the thoughts of his
    juniors&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I, and every other man in the ship, cannot help but
    sympathize with you. But whatever may be your record&mdash;if
    you were an escaped convict, Mr. Anstruther&mdash;no one could
    withhold from you the praise deserved for your magnificent
    stand against overwhelming odds. Our duty is plain. We will
    bring you to Singapore, where the others will no doubt wish to
    go immediately. I will tell the Captain what you have been good
    enough to acquaint us with. Meanwhile we will give you every
    assistance, and&mdash;er&mdash;attention in our power."</p>

    <p>A murmur of approbation ran through the little circle.
    Robert's face paled somewhat. What first-rate chaps they were,
    to be sure!</p>

    <p>"I can only thank you," he said unsteadily. "Your kindness
    is more trying than adversity."</p>

    <p>A rustle of silk, the intrusion into the intent knot of men
    of a young lady in a Paris gown, a Paris hat, carrying a
    Trouville parasol, and most exquisitely gloved and booted, made
    every one gasp.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Robert dear, how <i>could</i> you? I actually didn't
    know you!"</p>

    <p>Thus Iris, bewitchingly attired, and gazing now with
    provoking admiration at Robert, who certainly offered almost as
    great a contrast to his former state as did the girl herself.
    He returned her look with interest.</p>

    <p>"Would any man believe," he laughed, "that clothes would do
    so much for a woman?"</p>

    <p>"What a left-handed compliment! But come, dearest, Captain
    Fitzroy and Lord Ventnor have come ashore with father and me.
    They want us to show them everything! You will excuse him,
    won't you?" she added, with a seraphic smile to the others.</p>

    <p>They walked off together.</p>

    <p>"Jimmy!" gasped the fat midshipman to a lanky youth. "She's
    got on your togs!"</p>

    <p>Meaning that Iris had ransacked the <i>Orient's</i>
    theatrical wardrobe, and pounced on the swell outfit of the
    principal female impersonator in the ship's company.</p>

    <p>Lieutenant Playdon bit the chin strap of his pith helmet,
    for the landing party wore the regulation uniform for service
    ashore in the tropics. He muttered to his chief&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Damme if I've got the hang of this business yet."</p>

    <p>"Neither have I. Anstruther looks a decent sort of fellow,
    and the girl is a stunner. Yet, d'ye know, Playdon, right
    through the cruise I've always understood that she was the
    fianc&eacute;e of that cad, Ventnor."</p>

    <p>"Anstruther appears to have arranged matters differently.
    Wonder what pa will say when that Johnnie owns up about the
    court-martial."</p>

    <p>"Give it up, which is more than the girl will do, or I'm
    much mistaken. Funny thing, you know, but I've a sort of hazy
    recollection of Anstruther's name being mixed up with that of a
    Colonel's wife at Hong Kong. Fancy Ventnor was in it too, as a
    witness. Stand by, and we'll see something before we unload at
    Singapore."</p>
    <hr>
    <a name="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>

    <h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

    <h2>BARGAINS, GREAT AND SMALL</h2>

    <p>Lord Ventnor was no fool. Whilst Iris was transforming
    herself from a semi-savage condition into a semblance of an
    ultra <i>chic</i> Parisienne&mdash;the <i>Orient's</i> dramatic
    costumier went in for strong stage effects in feminine
    attire&mdash;Sir Arthur Deane told the Earl something of the
    state of affairs on the island.</p>

    <p>His lordship&mdash;a handsome, saturnine man, cool,
    insolently polite, and plentifully endowed with the judgmatical
    daring that is the necessary equipment of a society
    libertine&mdash;counseled patience, toleration, even silent
    recognition of Anstruther's undoubted claims for services
    rendered.</p>

    <p>"She is an enthusiastic, high-spirited girl," he urged upon
    his surprised hearer, who expected a very different expression
    of opinion. "This fellow Anstruther is a plausible sort of
    rascal, a good man in a tight place too&mdash;just the sort of
    fire-eating blackguard who would fill the heroic bill where a
    fight is concerned. Damn him, he licked me twice."</p>

    <p>Further amazement for the shipowner.</p>

    <p>"Yes, it's quite true. I interfered with his little games,
    and he gave me the usual reward of the devil's apothecary.
    Leave Iris alone. At present she is strung up to an intense
    pitch of gratitude, having barely escaped a terrible fate. Let
    her come back to the normal. Anstruther's shady record must
    gradually leak out. That will disgust her. In a week she will
    appeal to you to buy him off. He is hard up&mdash;cut off by
    his people and that sort of thing. There you probably have the
    measure of his scheming. He knows quite well that he can never
    marry your daughter. It is all a matter of price."</p>

    <p>Sir Arthur willingly allowed himself to be persuaded. At the
    back of his head there was an uneasy consciousness that it was
    not "all a matter of price." If it were he would never trust a
    man's face again. But Ventnor's well-balanced arguments swayed
    him. The course indicated was the only decent one. It was
    humanly impossible for a man to chide his daughter and flout
    her rescuer within an hour of finding them.</p>

    <p>Lord Ventnor played his cards with a deeper design. He bowed
    to the inevitable. Iris said she loved his rival. Very well. To
    attempt to dissuade her was to throw her more closely into that
    rival's arms. The right course was to appear resigned,
    saddened, compelled against his will to reveal the distressing
    truth. Further, he counted on Anstruther's quick temper as an
    active agent. Such a man would be the first to rebel against an
    assumption of pitying tolerance. He would bring bitter charges
    of conspiracy, of unbelievable compact to secure his ruin. All
    this must recoil on his own head when the facts were laid bare.
    Not even the hero of the island could prevail against the
    terrible indictment of the court-martial. Finally, at
    Singapore, three days distant, Colonel Costobell and his wife
    were staying. Lord Ventnor, alone of those on board, knew this.
    Indeed, he accompanied Sir Arthur Deane largely in order to
    break off a somewhat trying entanglement. He smiled
    complacently as he thought of the effect on Iris of Mrs.
    Costobell's indignant remonstrances when the baronet asked that
    injured lady to tell the girl all that had happened at Hong
    Kong.</p>

    <p>In a word, Lord Ventnor was most profoundly annoyed, and he
    cursed Anstruther from the depths of his heart. But he could
    see a way out. The more desperate the emergency the more need
    to display finesse. Above all, he must avoid an immediate
    rupture.</p>

    <p>He came ashore with Iris and her father; the captain of the
    <i>Orient</i> also joined the party. The three men watched
    Robert and the girl walking towards them from the group of
    officers.</p>

    <p>"Anstruther is a smart-looking fellow," commented Captain
    Fitzroy. "Who is he?"</p>

    <p>Truth to tell, the gallant commander of the <i>Orient</i>
    was secretly amazed by the metamorphosis effected in Robert's
    appearance since he scrutinized him through his glasses. Iris,
    too, unaccustomed to the constraint of high-heeled shoes, clung
    to the nondescript's arm in a manner that shook the sailor's
    faith in Lord Ventnor's pretensions as her favored suitor.</p>

    <p>Poor Sir Arthur said not a word, but his lordship was quite
    at ease&mdash;</p>

    <p>"From his name, and from what Deane tells me, I believe he
    is an ex-officer of the Indian Army."</p>

    <p>"Ah. He has left the service?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. I met him last in Hong Kong."</p>

    <p>"Then you know him?"</p>

    <p>"Quite well, if he is the man I imagine."</p>

    <p>"That is really very nice of Ventnor," thought the
    shipowner. "The last thing I should credit him with would be a
    forgiving disposition."</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Anstruther was reading Iris a little lecture.
    "Sweet one," he explained to her, "do not allude to me by my
    former rank. I am not entitled to it. Some day, please God, it
    will be restored to me. At present I am a plain civilian."</p>

    <p>"I think you very handsome."</p>

    <p>"Don't tease, there's a good girl. It is not fair with all
    these people looking."</p>

    <p>"But really, Robert, only since you scraped off the upper
    crust have I been able to recognize you again. I remember now
    that I thought you were a most distinguished looking
    steward."</p>

    <p>"Well, I am helpless. I cannot even squeeze you. By the way,
    Iris, during the next few days say nothing about our mine."</p>

    <p>"Oh, why not?"</p>

    <p>"Just a personal whim. It will please me."</p>

    <p>"If it pleases you, Robert, I am satisfied."</p>

    <p>He pressed her arm by way of answer. They were too near to
    the waiting trio for other comment.</p>

    <p>"Captain Fitzroy," cried Iris, "let me introduce Mr.
    Anstruther to you. Lord Ventnor, you have met Mr. Anstruther
    before."</p>

    <p>The sailor shook hands. Lord Ventnor smiled affably.</p>

    <p>"Your enforced residence on the island seems to have agreed
    with you," he said.</p>

    <p>"Admirably. Life here had its drawbacks, but we fought our
    enemies in the open. Didn't we, Iris?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, dear. The poor Dyaks were not sufficiently modernized
    to attack us with false testimony."</p>

    <p>His lordship's sallow face wrinkled somewhat. So Iris knew
    of the court-martial, nor was she afraid to proclaim to all the
    world that this man was her lover. As for Captain Fitzroy, his
    bushy eyebrows disappeared into his peaked cap when he heard
    the manner of their speech.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless Ventnor smiled again.</p>

    <p>"Even the Dyaks respected Miss Deane," he said.</p>

    <p>But Anstruther, sorry for the manifest uneasiness of the
    shipowner, repressed the retort on his lips, and forthwith
    suggested that they should walk to the north beach in the first
    instance, that being the scene of the wreck.</p>

    <p>During the next hour he became auditor rather than narrator.
    It was Iris who told of his wild fight against wind and waves,
    Iris who showed them where he fought with the devil-fish, Iris
    who expatiated on the long days of ceaseless toil, his
    dauntless courage in the face of every difficulty, the way in
    which he rescued her from the clutch of the savages, the skill
    of his preparations against the anticipated attack, and the
    last great achievement of all, when, time after time, he foiled
    the Dyaks' best-laid plans, and flung them off, crippled and
    disheartened, during the many phases of the thirty hours'
    battle.</p>

    <p>She had an attentive audience. Most of the <i>Orient's</i>
    officers quietly came up and followed the girl's glowing
    recital with breathless interest. Robert vainly endeavored more
    than once to laugh away her thrilling eulogy. But she would
    have none of it. Her heart was in her words. He deserved this
    tribute of praise, unstinted, unmeasured, abundant in its
    simple truth, yet sounding like a legend spun by some romantic
    poet, were not the grim evidences of its accuracy visible on
    every hand.</p>

    <p>She was so volubly clear, so precise in fact, so subtle in
    her clever delineations of humorous or tragic events, that her
    father was astounded, and even Anstruther silently admitted
    that a man might live until he equaled the years of a Biblical
    patriarch without discovering all the resources of a woman.</p>

    <p>There were tears in her eyes when she ended; but they were
    tears of thankful happiness, and Lord Ventnor, a silent
    listener who missed neither word nor look, felt a deeper chill
    in his cold heart as he realized that this woman's love could
    never be his. The knowledge excited his passion the more. His
    hatred of Anstruther now became a mania, an insensate resolve
    to mortally stab this meddler who always stood in his path.</p>

    <p>Robert hoped that his present ordeal was over. It had only
    begun. He was called on to answer questions without number. Why
    had the tunnel been made? What was the mystery of the Valley of
    Death? How did he manage to guess the dimensions of the
    sun-dial? How came he to acquire such an amazing stock of
    out-of-the-way knowledge of the edible properties of roots and
    trees? How? Why? Where? When? They never would be satisfied,
    for not even the British navypoking its nose into the recesses
    of the world&mdash;often comes across such an amazing story as
    the adventures of this couple on Rainbow Island.</p>

    <p>He readily explained the creation of quarry and cave by
    telling them of the vein of antimony embedded in the rock near
    the fault. Antimony is one of the substances that covers a
    multitude of doubts. No one, not excepting the doctors who use
    it, knows much about it, and in Chinese medicine it might be a
    chief factor of exceeding nastiness.</p>

    <p>Inside the cavern, the existence of the partially completed
    shaft to the ledge accounted for recent disturbances on the
    face of the rock, and new-comers could not, of course,
    distinguish the bones of poor "J.S." as being the remains of a
    European.</p>

    <p>Anstruther was satisfied that none of them hazarded the
    remotest guess as to the value of the gaunt rock they were
    staring at, and chance helped him to baffle further
    inquiry.</p>

    <p>A trumpeter on board the <i>Orient</i> was blowing his lungs
    out to summon them to luncheon, when Captain Fitzroy put a
    final query.</p>

    <p>"I can quite understand," he said to Robert, "that you have
    an affection for this weird place."</p>

    <p>"I should think so indeed," muttered the stout midshipman,
    glancing at Iris.</p>

    <p>"But I am curious to know," continued the commander, "why
    you lay claim to the island? You can hardly intend to return
    here."</p>

    <p>He pointed to Robert's placard stuck on the rock.</p>

    <p>Anstruther paused before he answered. He felt that Lord
    Ventnor's dark eyes were fixed on him. Everybody was more or
    less desirous to have this point cleared up. He looked the
    questioner squarely in the face.</p>

    <p>"In some parts of the world," he said, "there are sunken
    reefs, unknown, uncharted, on which many a vessel has been lost
    without any contributory fault on the part of her
    officers?"</p>

    <p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

    <p>"Well, Captain Fitzroy, when I was stationed with my
    regiment in Hong Kong I encountered such a reef, and wrecked my
    life on it. At least, that is how it seemed to me then. Fortune
    threw me ashore here, after a long and bitter submergence. You
    can hardly blame me if I cling to the tiny speck of land that
    gave me salvation."</p>

    <p>"No," admitted the sailor. He knew there was something more
    in the allegory than the text revealed, but it was no business
    of his.</p>

    <p>"Moreover," continued Robert smilingly, "you see I have a
    partner."</p>

    <p>"There cannot be the slightest doubt about the partner," was
    the prompt reply.</p>

    <p>Then every one laughed, Iris more than any, though Sir
    Arthur Deane's gaiety was forced, and Lord Ventnor could taste
    the acidity of his own smile.</p>

    <p>Later in the day the first lieutenant told his chief of
    Anstruther's voluntary statement concerning the court-martial.
    Captain Fitzroy was naturally pained by this unpleasant
    revelation, but he took exactly the same view as that expressed
    by the first lieutenant in Robert's presence.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless he pondered the matter, and seized an early
    opportunity of mentioning it to Lord Ventnor. That
    distinguished nobleman was vastly surprised to learn how
    Anstruther had cut the ground from beneath his feet.</p>

    <p>"Yes," he said, in reply to the sailor's request for
    information, "I know all about it. It could not well be
    otherwise, seeing that next to Mrs. Costobell I was the
    principal witness against him."</p>

    <p>"That must have been d&mdash;&mdash;d awkward for you," was
    the unexpected comment.</p>

    <p>"Indeed! Why?"</p>

    <p>"Because rumor linked your name with that of the lady in a
    somewhat outspoken way."</p>

    <p>"You astonish me. Anstruther certainly made some stupid
    allegations during the trial; but I had no idea he was able to
    spread this malicious report subsequently."</p>

    <p>"I am not talking of Hong Kong, my lord, but of Singapore,
    months later."</p>

    <p>Captain Fitzroy's tone was exceedingly dry. Indeed, some
    people might deem it offensive.</p>

    <p>His lordship permitted himself the rare luxury of an angry
    scowl.</p>

    <p>"Rumor is a lying jade at the best," he said curtly. "You
    must remember, Captain Fitzroy, that I have uttered no word of
    scandal about Mr. Anstruther, and any doubts concerning his
    conduct can be set at rest by perusing the records of his case
    in the Adjutant-General's office at Hong Kong."</p>

    <p>"Hum!" said the sailor, turning on his heel to enter the
    chart-room. This was no way to treat a real live lord, a
    personage of some political importance, too, such as the
    Special Envoy to Wang Hai. Evidently, Iris was no mean
    advocate. She had already won for the "outcast" the suffrages
    of the entire ship's company.</p>

    <p>The girl and her father went back to the island with Robert.
    After taking thought, the latter decided to ask Mir Jan to
    remain in possession until he returned. There was not much risk
    of another Dyak invasion. The fate of Taung S'Ali's expedition
    would not encourage a fresh set of marauders, and the
    Mahommedan would be well armed to meet unforeseen
    contingencies, whilst on his, Anstruther's, representations the
    <i>Orient</i> would land an abundance of stores. In any event,
    it was better for the native to live in freedom on Rainbow
    Island than to be handed over to the authorities as an escaped
    convict, which must be his immediate fate no matter what
    magnanimous view the Government of India might afterwards take
    of his services.</p>

    <p>Mir Jan's answer was emphatic. He took off his turban and
    placed it on Anstruther's feet.</p>

    <p>"Sahib," he said, "I am your dog. If, some day, I am found
    worthy to be your faithful servant, then shall I know that
    Allah has pardoned my transgressions. I only killed a man
    because&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Peace, Mir Jan. Let him rest."</p>

    <p>"Why is he worshiping you, Robert?" demanded Iris.</p>

    <p>He told her.</p>

    <p>"Really," she cried, "I must keep up my studies in
    Hindustani. It is quite too sweet."</p>

    <p>And then, for the benefit of her father, she rattled off
    into a spirited account of her struggles with the algebraic x
    and the Urdu compound verb.</p>

    <p>Sir Arthur Deane managed to repress a sigh. In spite of
    himself he could not help liking Anstruther. The man was
    magnetic, a hero, an ideal gentleman. No wonder his daughter
    was infatuated with him. Yet the future was dark and
    storm-tossed, full of sinister threats and complications. Iris
    did not know the wretched circumstances which had come to pass
    since they parted, and which had changed the whole aspect of
    his life. How could he tell her? Why should it be his miserable
    lot to snatch the cup of happiness from her lips? In that
    moment of silent agony he wished he were dead, for death alone
    could remove the burthen laid on him. Well, surely he might
    bask in the sunshine of her laughter for another day. No need
    to embitter her joyous heart until he was driven to it by dire
    necessity.</p>

    <p>So he resolutely brushed aside the woe-begone phantom of
    care, and entered into the <i>abandon</i> of the hour with a
    zest that delighted her. The dear girl imagined that Robert,
    her Robert, had made another speedy conquest, and Anstruther
    himself was much elated by the sudden change in Sir Arthur
    Deane's demeanor.</p>

    <p>They behaved like school children on a picnic. They roared
    over Iris's troubles in the matter of divided skirts, too much
    divided to be at all pleasant. The shipowner tasted some of her
    sago bread, and vowed it was excellent. They unearthed two
    bottles of champagne, the last of the case, and promised each
    other a hearty toast at dinner. Nothing would content Iris but
    that they should draw a farewell bucketful of water from the
    well and drench the pitcher-plant with a torrential shower.</p>

    <p>Robert carefully secured the pocket-books, money and other
    effects found on their dead companions. The baronet, of course,
    knew all the principal officers of the <i>Sirdar</i>. He
    surveyed these mournful relics with sorrowful interest.</p>

    <p>"The <i>Sirdar</i> was the crack ship of my fleet, and
    Captain Ross my most trusted commander," he said. "You may well
    imagine, Mr. Anstruther, what a cruel blow it was to lose such
    a vessel, with all these people on board, and my only daughter
    amongst them. I wonder now that it did not kill me."</p>

    <p>"She was a splendid sea-boat, sir. Although disabled, she
    fought gallantly against the typhoon. Nothing short of a reef
    would break her up."</p>

    <p>"Ah, well," sighed the shipowner, "the few timbers you have
    shown me here are the remaining assets out of
    &pound;300,000."</p>

    <p>"Was she not insured?" inquired Robert.</p>

    <p>"No; that is, I have recently adopted a scheme of mutual
    self-insurance, and the loss falls <i>pro rata</i> on my other
    vessels."</p>

    <p>The baronet glanced covertly at Iris. The words conveyed
    little meaning to her. Indeed, she broke in with a
    laugh&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I am afraid I have heard you say, father dear, that some
    ships in the fleet paid you best when they ran ashore."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Iris. That often happened in the old days. It is
    different now. Moreover, I have not told you the extent of my
    calamities. The <i>Sirdar</i> was lost on March 18, though I
    did not know it for certain until this morning. But on March 25
    the <i>Bahadur</i> was sunk in the Mersey during a fog, and
    three days later the <i>Jemadar</i> turned turtle on the James
    and Mary shoal in the Hooghly. Happily there were no lives lost
    in either of these cases."</p>

    <p>Even Iris was appalled by this list of casualties.</p>

    <p>"My poor, dear dad!" she cried. "To think that all these
    troubles should occur the very moment I left you!"</p>

    <p>Yet she gave no thought to the serious financial effect of
    such a string of catastrophes. Robert, of course, appreciated
    this side of the business, especially in view of the
    shipowner's remark about the insurance. But Sir Arthur Deane's
    stiff upper lip deceived him. He failed to realize that the
    father was acting a part for his daughter's sake.</p>

    <p>Oddly enough, the baronet did not seek to discuss with them
    the legal-looking document affixed near the cave. It claimed
    all rights in the island in their joint names, and this was a
    topic he wished to avoid. For the time, therefore, the younger
    man had no opportunity of taking him into his confidence, and
    Iris held faithfully to her promise of silence.</p>

    <p>The girl's ragged raiment, sou'wester, and strong boots were
    already packed away on board. She now rescued the Bible, the
    copy of Tennyson's poems, the battered tin cup, her revolver,
    and the Lee-Metford which "scared" the Dyaks when they nearly
    caught Anstruther and Mir Jan napping. Robert also gathered for
    her an assortment of Dyak hats, belts, and arms, including
    Taung S'Ali's parang and a sumpitan. These were her trophies,
    the <i>spolia opima</i> of the campaign.</p>

    <p>His concluding act was to pack two of the empty oil tins
    with all the valuable lumps of auriferous quartz he could find
    where he shot the rubbish from the cave beneath the trees. On
    top of these he placed some antimony ore, and Mir Jan,
    wondering why the sahib wanted the stuff, carried the
    consignment to the waiting boat. Lieutenant Playdon, in command
    of the last party of sailors to quit the island, evidently
    expected Mir Jan to accompany them, but Anstruther explained
    that the man would await his return, some time in June or
    July.</p>

    <p>Sir Arthur Deane found himself speculating on the cause of
    this extraordinary resolve, but, steadfast to his policy of
    avoiding controversial matters, said nothing. A few words to
    the captain procured enough stores to keep the Mahommedan for
    six months at least, and whilst these were being landed, the
    question was raised how best to dispose of the Dyaks.</p>

    <p>The commander wished to consult the convenience of his
    guests.</p>

    <p>"If we go a little out of our way and land them in Borneo,"
    he said, "they will be hanged without troubling you further. If
    I take them to Singapore they will be tried on your evidence
    and sent to penal servitude. Which is it to be?"</p>

    <p>It was Iris who decided.</p>

    <p>"I cannot bear to think of more lives being sacrificed," she
    protested. "Perhaps if these men are treated mercifully and
    sent to their homes after some punishment their example may
    serve as a deterrent to others."</p>

    <p>So it was settled that way. The anchor rattled up to its
    berth and the <i>Orient</i> turned her head towards Singapore.
    As she steadily passed away into the deepening azure, the girl
    and her lover watched the familiar outlines of Rainbow Island
    growing dim in the evening light. For a long while they could
    see Mir Jan's tall, thin figure motionless on a rock at the
    extremity of Europa Point. Their hut, the reef, the ledge, came
    into view as the cruiser swung round to a more northerly
    course.</p>

    <p>Iris had thrown an arm across her father's shoulders. The
    three were left alone just then, and they were silent for many
    minutes. At last, the flying miles merged the solitary palm
    beyond the lagoon with the foliage on the cliff. The wide cleft
    of Prospect Park grew less distinct. Mir Jan's white-clothed
    figure was lost in the dark background. The island was becoming
    vague, dream-like, a blurred memory.</p>

    <p>"Robert," said the girl devoutly, "God has been very good to
    us."</p>

    <p>"Yes," he replied. "I was thinking, even this instant, of
    the verse that is carved on the gate of the Memorial Well at
    Cawnpore: 'These are they which came out of great tribulation.'
    We, too, have come out of great tribulation, happily with our
    lives&mdash;and more. The decrees of fate are indeed
    inscrutable."</p>

    <p>Iris turned to him a face roseate with loving
    comprehension.</p>

    <p>"Do you remember this hour yesterday?" she
    murmured&mdash;"how we suffered from thirst&mdash;how the Dyaks
    began their second attack from the ridge&mdash;how you climbed
    down the ladder and I followed you? Oh father, darling," she
    went on impulsively, tightening her grasp, "you will never know
    how brave he was, how enduring, how he risked all for me and
    cheered me to the end, even though the end seemed to be the
    grave."</p>

    <p>"I think I am beginning to understand now," answered the
    shipowner, averting his eyes lest Iris should see the tears in
    them. Their Calvary was ended, they thought&mdash;was it for
    him to lead them again through the sorrowful way? It was a
    heartrending task that lay before him, a task from which his
    soul revolted. He refused even to attempt it. He sought
    forgetfulness in a species of mental intoxication, and
    countenanced his daughter's love idyll with such apparent
    approval that Lord Ventnor wondered whether Sir Arthur were not
    suffering from senile decay.</p>

    <p>The explanation of the shipowner's position was painfully
    simple. Being a daring yet shrewd financier, he perceived in
    the troubled condition of the Far East a magnificent
    opportunity to consolidate the trading influence of his
    company. He negotiated two big loans, one, of a semi-private
    nature, to equip docks and railways in the chief maritime
    province of China, the other of a more public character, with
    the Government of Japan. All his own resources, together with
    those of his principal directors and shareholders, were devoted
    to these objects. Contemporaneously, he determined to stop
    paying heavy insurance premiums on his fleet and make it
    self-supporting, on the well-known mutual principle.</p>

    <p>His vessels were well equipped, well manned, replete with
    every modern improvement, and managed with great commercial
    skill. In three or four years, given ordinary trading luck, he
    must have doubled his own fortune and earned a world-wide
    reputation for far-seeing sagacity.</p>

    <p>No sooner were all his arrangements completed than three of
    his best ships went down, saddling his company with an absolute
    loss of nearly &pound;600,000, and seriously undermining his
    financial credit. A fellow-director, wealthy and influential,
    resigned his seat on the board, and headed a clique of
    disappointed stockholders. At once the fair sky became
    overcast. A sound and magnificent speculation threatened to
    dissolve in the Bankruptcy Court.</p>

    <p>Sir Arthur Deane's energy and financial skill might have
    enabled him to weather this unexpected gale were it not for the
    apparent loss of his beloved daughter with the crack ship of
    his line. Half-frenzied with grief, he bade his enemies do
    their worst, and allowed his affairs to get into hopeless
    confusion whilst he devoted himself wholly to the search for
    Iris and her companions. At this critical juncture Lord Ventnor
    again reached his side. His lordship possessed a large private
    fortune and extensive estates. He was prudent withal, and knew
    how admirably the shipowner's plans would develop if given the
    necessary time. He offered the use of his name and money. He
    more than filled the gap created by the hostile ex-director.
    People argued that such a clever man, just returning from the
    Far East after accomplishing a public mission of some
    importance, must be a reliable guide. The mere cabled
    intelligence of his intention to join the board restored
    confidence and credit.</p>

    <p>But&mdash;there was a bargain. If Iris lived, she must
    become the Countess of Ventnor. His lordship was weary of
    peripatetic love-making. It was high time he settled down in
    life, took an interest in the legislature, and achieved a
    position in the world of affairs. He had a chance now. The
    certain success of his friend's project, the fortunate
    completion of his own diplomatic undertaking, marriage with a
    beautiful and charming woman&mdash;these items would
    consolidate his career. If Iris were not available, plenty of
    women, high-placed in society, would accept such an eligible
    bachelor. But his heart was set on Iris. She was honest,
    high-principled, pure in body and mind, and none prizes these
    essentials in a wife more than a worn-out
    <i>rou&eacute;</i>.</p>

    <p>He seized the first opportunity that presented itself to
    make Sir Arthur Deane acquainted with a decision already
    dreaded by the unfortunate shipowner. Iris must either abandon
    her infatuation for Anstruther or bring about the ruin of her
    father. There was no mean.</p>

    <p>"If she declines to become Countess of Ventnor, she can
    marry whom she likes, as you will be all paupers together," was
    the Earl's caustic summing up.</p>

    <p>This brutal argument rather overshot the mark. The
    shipowner's face flushed with anger, and Lord Ventnor hastened
    to retrieve a false step.</p>

    <p>"I didn't exactly mean to put it that way, Deane, but my
    temper is a little short these days. My position on board this
    ship is intolerable. As a matter of fair dealing to me, you
    should put a stop to your daughter's attitude towards
    Anstruther, on the ground that her engagement is neither
    approved of by you nor desirable under any consideration."</p>

    <p>It may be assumed from this remark that even the Earl's
    sardonic temper was ruffled by the girl's outrageous behavior.
    Nor was it exactly pleasant to him to note how steadily
    Anstruther advanced in the favor of every officer on the ship.
    By tacit consent the court-martial was tabooed, at any rate
    until the <i>Orient</i> reached Singapore. Every one knew that
    the quarrel lay between Robert and Ventnor, and it is not to be
    wondered at if Iris's influence alone were sufficient to turn
    the scale in favor of her lover.</p>

    <p>The shipowner refused point-blank to interfere in any way
    during the voyage.</p>

    <p>"You promised your co-operation in business even if we found
    that the <i>Sirdar</i> had gone down with all hands," he
    retorted bitterly. "Do you wish me to make my daughter believe
    she has come back into my life only to bring me irretrievable
    ruin?"</p>

    <p>"That appears to be the result, no matter how you may
    endeavor to disguise it."</p>

    <p>"I thought the days were gone when a man would wish to marry
    a woman against her will."</p>

    <p>"Nonsense! What does she know about it? The glamour of this
    island romance will soon wear off. It would be different if
    Anstruther were able to maintain her even decently. He is an
    absolute beggar, I tell you. Didn't he ship on your own vessel
    as a steward? Take my tip, Deane. Tell him how matters stand
    with you, and he will cool off."</p>

    <p>He believed nothing of the sort, but he was desperately
    anxious that Iris should learn the truth as to her father's
    dilemma from other lips than his own. This would be the first
    point gained. Others would follow.</p>

    <p>The two men were conversing in the Earl's cabin. On the deck
    overhead a very different chat was taking place.</p>

    <p>The <i>Orient</i> was due in Singapore that afternoon. Iris
    was invited into the chart-room on some pretext, and Lieutenant
    Playdon, delegated by the commander and the first lieutenant,
    buttonholed Robert.</p>

    <p>With sailor-like directness he came straight to the
    point&mdash;</p>

    <p>"A few of us have been talking about you, Anstruther, and we
    cannot be far wrong in assuming that you are hard up. The fact
    that you took a steward's job on the <i>Sirdar</i> shows your
    disinclination to appeal to your own people for funds. Now,
    once you are ashore, you will be landed in difficulties. To cut
    any further explanations, I am commissioned to offer you a loan
    of fifty pounds, which you can repay when you like."</p>

    <p>Robert's mouth tightened somewhat. For the moment he could
    not find words. Playdon feared he was offended.</p>

    <p>"I am sorry, old chap, if we are mistaken," he said
    hesitatingly; "but we really thought&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Please do not endeavor to explain away your generous act,"
    exclaimed Anstruther. "I accept it thankfully, on one
    condition."</p>

    <p>"Blow the condition. But what is it?"</p>

    <p>"That you tell me the names of those to whom I am indebted
    besides yourself."</p>

    <p>"Oh, that is easy enough. Fitzroy and the first luff are the
    others. We kept it to a small circle, don't you know. Thought
    you would prefer that."</p>

    <p>Anstruther smiled and wrung his hand. There were some good
    fellows left in the world after all. The three officers acted
    in pure good nature. They were assisting a man apparently down
    in his luck, who would soon be called on to face other
    difficulties by reason of his engagement to a girl apparently
    so far removed from him in station. And the last thing they
    dreamed of was that their kindly loan was destined to yield
    them a better return than all the years of their naval service,
    for their fifty pounds had gone into the pocket of a potential
    millionaire, who was endowed with the faculty, rare in
    millionaires, of not forgetting the friends of his
    poverty-stricken days.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

    <h2>RAINBOW ISLAND AGAIN&mdash;AND AFTERWARD</h2>

    <p>Sir Arthur Deane was sitting alone in his cabin in a state
    of deep dejection, when he was aroused by a knock, and Robert
    entered.</p>

    <p>"Can you give me half an hour?" he asked. "I have something
    to say to you before we land."</p>

    <p>The shipowner silently motioned him to a seat.</p>

    <p>"It concerns Iris and myself," continued Anstruther. "I
    gathered from your words when we met on the island that both
    you and Lord Ventnor regarded Iris as his lordship's promised
    bride. From your point of view the arrangement was perhaps
    natural and equitable, but since your daughter left Hong Kong
    it happens that she and I have fallen in love with each other.
    No; please listen to me. I am not here to urge my claims on
    you. I won her fairly and intend to keep her, were the whole
    House of Peers opposed to me. At this moment I want to tell
    you, her father, why she could never, even under other
    circumstances, marry Lord Ventnor."</p>

    <p>Then he proceeded to place before the astounded baronet a
    detailed history of his recent career. It was a sordid story of
    woman's perfidy, twice told. It carried conviction in every
    sentence. It was possible, of course, to explain matters more
    fully to the baronet than to Iris, and Anstruther's fierce
    resentment of the cruel wrong inflicted upon him blazed forth
    with overwhelming force. The intensity of his wrath in no way
    impaired the cogency of his arguments. Rather did it lend point
    and logical brevity. Each word burned itself into his hearer's
    consciousness, for Robert did not know that the unfortunate
    father was being coerced to a distasteful compact by the
    scoundrel who figured in the narrative as his evil genius.</p>

    <p>At the conclusion Sir Arthur bowed his head between his
    hands.</p>

    <p>"I cannot choose but believe you," he admitted huskily. "Yet
    how came you to be so unjustly convicted by a tribunal composed
    of your brother officers?"</p>

    <p>"They could not help themselves. To acquit me meant that
    they discredited the sworn testimony not only of my Colonel's
    wife, but of the civil head of an important Government Mission,
    not to mention some bought Chinese evidence. Am I the first man
    to be offered up as a sacrifice on the altar of official
    expediency?"</p>

    <p>"But you are powerless now. You can hardly hope to have your
    case revised. What chance is there that your name will ever be
    cleared?"</p>

    <p>"Mrs. Costobell can do it if she will. The vagaries of such
    a woman are not to be depended on. If Lord Ventnor has cast her
    off, her hatred may 'prove stronger than her passion. Anyhow, I
    should be the last man to despair of God's Providence. Compare
    the condition of Iris and myself today with our plight during
    the second night on the ledge! I refuse to believe that a bad
    and fickle woman can resist the workings of destiny, and it was
    a happy fate which led me to ship on board the <i>Sirdar</i>,
    though at the time I saw it in another light."</p>

    <p>How different the words, the aspirations, of the two
    suitors. Quite unconsciously, Robert could not have pleaded
    better. The shipowner sighed heavily.</p>

    <p>"I hope your faith will be justified. If it be not&mdash;the
    more likely thing to happen&mdash;do I understand that my
    daughter and you intend to get married whether I give or
    withhold my sanction?"</p>

    <p>Anstruther rose and opened the door.</p>

    <p>"I have ventured to tell you," he said, "why she should not
    marry Lord Ventnor. When I come to you and ask you for her,
    which I pray may be soon, it will be time enough to answer that
    question, should you then decide to put it."</p>

    <p>It must be remembered that Robert knew nothing whatever of
    the older man's predicament, whilst the baronet, full of his
    own troubles, was in no mood to take a reasonable view of
    Anstruther's position. Neither Iris nor Robert could make him
    understand the long-drawn-out duel of their early life on the
    island, nor was it easy to depict the tumultuous agony of that
    terrible hour on the ledge when the girl forced the man to
    confess his love by suggesting acceptance of the Dyaks'
    terms.</p>

    <p>Thus, for a little while, these two were driven apart, and
    Anstruther disdained to urge the plea that not many weeks would
    elapse before he would be a richer man than his rival. The
    chief sufferer was Sir Arthur Deane. Had Iris guessed how her
    father was tormented, she would not have remained on the
    bridge, radiant and mirthful, whilst the grey-haired baronet
    gazed with stony-eyed despair at some memoranda which he
    extracted from his papers.</p>

    <p>"Ten thousand pounds!" he muttered. "Not a great sum for the
    millionaire financier, Sir Arthur Deane, to raise on his note
    of hand. A few months ago men offered me one hundred times the
    amount on no better security. And now, to think that a set of
    jabbering fools in London should so destroy my credit and their
    own, that not a bank will discount our paper unless they are
    assured Lord Ventnor has joined the board! Fancy me, of all
    men, being willing to barter my child for a few pieces of
    gold!"</p>

    <p>The thought was maddening. For a little while he yielded to
    utter despondency. It was quite true that a comparatively small
    amount of money would restore the stability of his firm. Even
    without it, were his credit unimpaired, he could easily tide
    over the period of depression until the first fruits of his
    enterprise were garnered. Then, all men would hail him as a
    genius.</p>

    <p>Wearily turning over his papers, he suddenly came across the
    last letter written to him by Iris's mother. How she doted on
    their only child! He recalled one night, shortly before his
    wife died, when the little Iris was brought into her room to
    kiss her and lisp her infantile prayers. She had devised a
    formula of her own&mdash;"God bless father! God bless mother!
    God bless me, their little girl!"</p>

    <p>And what was it she cried to him from the beach?</p>

    <p>"Your own little girl given back to you!"</p>

    <p>Given back to him! For what&mdash;to marry that
    black-hearted scoundrel whose pastime was the degradation of
    women and the defaming of honest men? That settled it.
    Instantly the cloud was lifted from his soul. A great peace
    came upon him. The ruin of his business he might not be able to
    avert, but he would save from, the wreck that which he prized
    more than all else&mdash;his daughter's love.</p>

    <p>The engines dropped to half speed&mdash;they were entering
    the harbor of Singapore. In a few hours the worst would be
    over. If Ventnor telegraphed to London his withdrawal from the
    board, nothing short of a cabled draft for ten thousand pounds
    would prevent certain creditors from filing a bankruptcy
    petition. In the local banks the baronet had about a thousand
    to his credit. Surely among the rich merchants of the port, men
    who knew the potentialities of his scheme, he would be able to
    raise the money needed. He would try hard. Already he felt
    braver. The old fire had returned to his blood. The very belief
    that he was acting in the way best calculated to secure his
    daughter's happiness stimulated and encouraged him.</p>

    <p>He went on deck, to meet Iris skipping down the
    hatchway.</p>

    <p>"Oh, there you are!" she cried. "I was just coming to find
    out why you were moping in your cabin. You are missing the most
    beautiful view&mdash;all greens, and blues, and browns! Run,
    quick! I want you to see every inch of it."</p>

    <p>She held out her hand and pulled him gleefully up the steps.
    Leaning against the taffrail, some distance apart from each
    other, were Anstruther and Lord Ventnor. Need it be said to
    whom Iris drew her father?</p>

    <p>"Here he is, Robert," she laughed. "I do believe he was
    sulking because Captain Fitzroy was so very attentive to me.
    Yet you didn't mind it a bit!"</p>

    <p>The two men looked into each other eyes. They smiled. How
    could they resist the contagion of her sunny nature?</p>

    <p>"I have been thinking over what you said to me just now,
    Anstruther," said the shipowner slowly.</p>

    <p>"Oh!" cried Iris. "Have you two been talking secrets behind
    my back?"</p>

    <p>"It is no secret to you&mdash;my little girl&mdash;" Her
    father's voice lingered on the phrase. "When we are on shore,
    Robert, I will explain matters to you more fully. Just now I
    wish only to tell you that where Iris has given her heart I
    will not refuse her hand."</p>

    <p>"You darling old dad! And is that what all the mystery was
    about?"</p>

    <p>She took his face between her hands and kissed him. Lord
    Ventnor, wondering at this effusiveness, strolled forward.</p>

    <p>"What has happened, Miss Deane?" he inquired. "Have you just
    discovered what an excellent parent you possess?"</p>

    <p>The baronet laughed, almost hysterically. "'Pon my honor,"
    he cried, "you could not have hit upon a happier
    explanation."</p>

    <p>His lordship was not quite satisfied.</p>

    <p>"I suppose you will take Iris to Smith's Hotel?" he said
    with cool impudence.</p>

    <p>Iris answered him.</p>

    <p>"Yes. My father has just asked Robert to come with
    us&mdash;by inference, that is. Where are you going?"</p>

    <p>The adroit use of her lover's Christian name goaded his
    lordship to sudden heat.</p>

    <p>"Indeed!" he snarled. "Sir Arthur Deane has evidently
    decided a good many things during the last hour."</p>

    <p>"Yes," was the shipowner's quiet retort. "I have decided
    that my daughter's happiness should be the chief consideration
    of my remaining years. All else must give way to it."</p>

    <p>The Earl's swarthy face grew sallow with fury. His eyes
    blazed, and there was a tense vibrato in his voice as he
    said&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Then I must congratulate you, Miss Deane. You are fated to
    endure adventures. Having escaped from the melodramatic perils
    of Rainbow Island you are destined to experience another
    variety of shipwreck here."</p>

    <p>He left them. Not a word had Robert spoken throughout the
    unexpected scene. His heart was throbbing with a tremulous joy,
    and his lordship's sneers were lost on him. But he could not
    fail to note the malignant purpose of the parting sentence.</p>

    <p>In his quietly masterful way he placed his hand on the
    baronet's shoulder.</p>

    <p>"What did Lord Ventnor mean?" he asked.</p>

    <p>Sir Arthur Deane answered, with a calm smile&mdash;"It is
    difficult to talk openly at this moment. Wait until we reach
    the hotel."</p>

    <p>The news flew fast through the settlement that H.M.S.
    <i>Orient</i> had returned from her long search for the
    <i>Sirdar</i>. The warship occupied her usual anchorage, and a
    boat was lowered to take off the passengers. Lieutenant Playdon
    went ashore with them. A feeling of consideration for
    Anstruther prevented any arrangements being made for subsequent
    meetings. Once their courteous duty was ended, the officers of
    the <i>Orient</i> could not give him any further social
    recognition.</p>

    <p>Lord Ventnor was aware of this fact and endeavored to turn
    it to advantage.</p>

    <p>"By the way, Fitzroy," he called out to the commander as he
    prepared to descend the gangway, "I want you, and any others
    not detained by duty, to come and dine with me tonight."</p>

    <p>Captain Fitzroy answered blandly&mdash;"It is very good of
    you to ask us, but I fear I cannot make any definite
    arrangements until I learn what orders are awaiting me
    here."</p>

    <p>"Oh, certainly. Come if you can, eh?"</p>

    <p>"Yes; suppose we leave it at that."</p>

    <p>It was a polite but decided rebuff. It in no way tended to
    sweeten Lord Ventnor's temper, which was further exasperated
    when he hurt his shin against one of Robert's
    disreputable-looking tins, with its accumulation of debris.</p>

    <p>The boat swung off into the tideway. Her progress shorewards
    was watched by a small knot of people, mostly loungers and
    coolies. Among them, however, were two persons who had driven
    rapidly to the landing-place when the arrival of the
    <i>Orient</i> was reported. One bore all the distinguishing
    marks of the army officer of high rank, but the other was
    unmistakably a globetrotter. Only in Piccadilly could he have
    purchased his wondrous <i>sola topi</i>, or pith
    helmet&mdash;with its imitation <i>puggri</i> neatly frilled
    and puckered&mdash;and no tailor who ever carried his goose
    through the Exile's Gate would have fashioned his expensive
    garments. But the old gentleman made no pretence that he could
    "hear the East a-callin'." He swore impartially at the climate,
    the place, and its inhabitants. At this instant he was in a
    state of wild excitement. He was very tall, very stout,
    exceedingly red-faced. Any budding medico who understood the
    pre-eminence enjoyed by <i>aq. ad</i> in a prescription, would
    have diagnosed him as a first-rate subject for apoplexy.</p>

    <p>Producing a tremendous telescope, he vainly endeavored to
    balance it on the shoulder of a native servant.</p>

    <p>"Can't you stand still, you blithering idiot!" he shouted,
    after futile attempts to focus the advancing boat, "or shall I
    steady you by a clout over the ear?"</p>

    <p>His companion, the army man, was looking through a pair of
    field-glasses.</p>

    <p>"By Jove!" he cried, "I can see Sir Arthur Deane, and a girl
    who looks like his daughter. There's that infernal scamp,
    Ventnor, too."</p>

    <p>The big man brushed the servant out of his way, and
    brandished the telescope as though it were a bludgeon.</p>

    <p>"The dirty beggar! He drove my lad to misery and death, yet
    he has come back safe and sound. Wait till I meet him.
    I'll&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Now, Anstruther! Remember your promise. I will deal with
    Lord Ventnor. My vengeance has first claim. What! By the
    jumping Moses, I do believe&mdash;Yes. It is. Anstruther! Your
    nephew is sitting next to the girl!"</p>

    <p>The telescope fell on the stones with a crash. The giant's
    rubicund face suddenly blanched. He leaned on his friend for
    support.</p>

    <p>"You are not mistaken," he almost whimpered. "Look again,
    for God's sake, man. Make sure before you speak. Tell me! Tell
    me!"</p>

    <p>"Calm yourself, Anstruther. It is Robert, as sure as I'm
    alive. Don't you think I know him, my poor disgraced friend,
    whom I, like all the rest, cast off in his hour of trouble? But
    I had some excuse. There! There! I didn't mean that, old
    fellow. Robert himself will be the last man to blame either of
    us. Who could have suspected that two people&mdash;one of them,
    God help me! my wife&mdash;would concoct such a hellish
    plot!"</p>

    <p>The boat glided gracefully alongside the steps of the quay,
    and Playdon sprang ashore to help Iris to alight. What happened
    immediately afterwards can best be told in his own words, as he
    retailed the story to an appreciative audience in the
    ward-room.</p>

    <p>"We had just landed," he said, "and some of the crew were
    pushing the coolies out of the way, when two men jumped down
    the steps, and a most fiendish row sprang up. That is, there
    was no dispute or wrangling, but one chap, who, it turned out,
    was Colonel Costobell, grabbed Ventnor by the shirt front, and
    threatened to smash his face in if he didn't listen then and
    there to what he had to say. I really thought about
    interfering, until I heard Colonel Costobell's opening words.
    After that I would gladly have seen the beggar chucked into the
    harbor. We never liked him, did we?"</p>

    <p>"Ask no questions, Pompey, but go ahead with the yarn,"
    growled the first lieutenant.</p>

    <p>"Well, it seems that Mrs. Costobell is dead. She got enteric
    a week after the <i>Orient</i> sailed, and was a goner in four
    days. Before she died she owned up."</p>

    <p>He paused, with a base eye to effect. Not a man moved a
    muscle.</p>

    <p>"All right," he cried. "I will make no more false starts.
    Mrs. Costobell begged her husband's forgiveness for her
    treatment of him, and confessed that she and Lord Ventnor
    planned the affair for which Anstruther was tried by
    court-martial. It must have been a beastly business, for
    Costobell was sweating with rage, though his words were icy
    enough. And you ought to have seen Ventnor's face when he heard
    of the depositions, sworn to and signed by Mrs. Costobell and
    by several Chinese servants whom he bribed to give false
    evidence. He promised to marry Mrs. Costobell if her husband
    died, or, in any event, to bring about a divorce when the Hong
    Kong affair had blown over. Then she learnt that he was after
    Miss Iris, and there is no doubt her fury helped on the fever.
    Costobell said that, for his wife's sake, he would have kept
    the wretched thing secret, but he was compelled to clear
    Anstruther's name, especially as he came across the other old
    Johnnie&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Pompey, you are incoherent with excitement. Who is 'the
    other old Johnnie'?" asked the first luff severely.</p>

    <p>"Didn't I tell you? Why, Anstruther's uncle, of course, a
    heavy old swell with just a touch of Yorkshire in his tongue. I
    gathered that he disinherited his nephew when the news of the
    court-martial reached him. Then he relented, and cabled to him.
    Getting no news, he came East to look for him. He met Costobell
    the day after the lady died, and the two swore&mdash;the stout
    uncle can swear a treat&mdash;anyhow, they vowed to be revenged
    on Ventnor, and to clear Anstruther's character, living or
    dead. Poor old chap! He cried like a baby when he asked the
    youngster to forgive him. It was quite touching. I can tell
    you&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Playdon affected to search for his pocket-handkerchief.</p>

    <p>"Do tell us, or it will be worse for you," cried his
    mentor.</p>

    <p>"Give me time, air, a drink! What you fellows want is a
    phonograph. Let me see. Well, Costobell shook Ventnor off at
    last, with the final observation that Anstruther's
    court-martial has been quashed. The next batch of general
    orders will re-instate him in the regiment, and it rests with
    him to decide whether or not a criminal warrant shall be issued
    against his lordship for conspiracy. Do you fellows know what
    conspir&mdash;?"</p>

    <p>"You cuckoo! What did Miss Deane do?"</p>

    <p>"Clung to Anstruther like a weeping angel, and kissed
    everybody all round when Ventnor got away. Well&mdash;hands
    off. I mean her father, Anstruther and the stout uncle.
    Unfortunately I was not on in that scene. But, for some reason,
    they all nearly wrung my arm off, and the men were so excited
    that they gave the party a rousing cheer as their rickshaws
    went off in a bunch. Will no Christian gentleman get me a
    drink?"</p>

    <p>The next commotion arose in the hotel when Sir Arthur Deane
    seized the first opportunity to explain the predicament in
    which his company was placed, and the blow which Lord Ventnor
    yet had it in his power to deal.</p>

    <p>Mr. William Anstruther was an interested auditor. Robert
    would have spoken, but his uncle restrained him.</p>

    <p>"Leave this to me, lad," he exclaimed. "When I was coming
    here in the <i>Sirdar</i> there was a lot of talk about Sir
    Arthur's scheme, and there should not be much difficulty in
    raising all the brass required, if half what I heard be true.
    Sit you down, Sir Arthur, and tell us all about it."</p>

    <p>The shipowner required no second bidding. With the skill for
    which he was noted, he described his operations in detail,
    telling how every farthing of the first instalments of the two
    great loans was paid up, how the earnings of his fleet would
    quickly overtake the deficit in capital value caused by the
    loss of the three ships, and how, in six months' time, the
    leading financial houses of London, Paris, and Berlin would be
    offering him more money than he would need.</p>

    <p>To a shrewd man of business the project could not fail to
    commend itself, and the Yorkshire squire, though a trifle
    obstinate in temper, was singularly clear-headed in other
    respects. He brought his great fist down on the table with a
    whack.</p>

    <p>"Send a cable to your company, Sir Arthur," he cried, "and
    tell them that your prospective son-in-law will provide the ten
    thousand pounds you require. I will see that his draft is
    honored. You can add, if you like, that another ten will be
    ready if wanted when this lot is spent. I did my lad one
    d&mdash;er&mdash;deuced bad turn in my life. This time, I
    think, I am doing him a good one."</p>

    <p>"You are, indeed," said Iris's father enthusiastically. "The
    unallotted capital he is taking up will be worth four times its
    face value in two years."</p>

    <p>"All the more reason to make his holding twenty instead of
    ten," roared the Yorkshireman. "But look here. You talk about
    dropping proceedings against that precious earl whom I saw
    to-day. Why not tell him not to try any funny tricks until
    Robert's money is safely lodged to your account? We have him in
    our power. Dash it all, let us use him a bit."</p>

    <p>Even Iris laughed at this naive suggestion. It was
    delightful to think that their arch enemy was actually helping
    the baronet's affairs at that very moment, and would continue
    to do so until he was flung aside as being of no further value.
    Although Ventnor himself had carefully avoided any formal
    commitment, the cablegrams awaiting the shipowner at Singapore
    showed that confidence had already been restored by the
    uncontradicted use of his lordship's name.</p>

    <p>Robert at last obtained a hearing.</p>

    <p>"You two are quietly assuming the attitude of the financial
    magnates of this gathering," he said. "I must admit that you
    have managed things very well between you, and I do not propose
    for one moment to interfere with your arrangements.
    Nevertheless, Iris and I are really the chief moneyed persons
    present. You spoke of financial houses in England and on the
    Continent backing up your loans six months hence, Sir Arthur.
    You need not go to them. We will be your bankers."</p>

    <p>The baronet laughed with a whole-hearted gaiety that
    revealed whence Iris got some part, at least, of her bright
    disposition.</p>

    <p>"Will you sell your island, Robert?" he cried. "I am afraid
    that not even Iris could wheedle any one into buying it."</p>

    <p>"But father, dear," interrupted the girl earnestly, "what
    Robert says is true. We have a gold mine there. It is worth so
    much that you will hardly believe it until then? can no longer
    be any doubt in your mind. I suppose that is why Robert asked
    me not to mention his discovery to you earlier."</p>

    <p>"No, Iris, that was not the reason," said her lover, and the
    older men felt that more than idle fancy inspired the
    astounding intelligence that they had just heard. "Your love
    was more to me than all the gold in the world. I had won you. I
    meant to keep you, but I refused to buy you."</p>

    <p>He turned to her father. His pent-up emotion mastered him,
    and he spoke as one who could no longer restrain his
    feelings.</p>

    <p>"I have had no chance to thank you for the words you uttered
    at the moment we quitted the ship. Yet I will treasure them
    while life lasts. You gave Iris to me when I was poor,
    disgraced, an outcast from my family and my profession. And I
    know why you did this thing. It was because you valued her
    happiness more than riches or reputation. I am sorry now I did
    not explain matters earlier. It would have saved you much
    needless suffering. But the sorrow has sped like an evil dream,
    and you will perhaps not regret it, for your action today binds
    me to you with hoops of steel. And you, too, uncle. You
    traveled thousands of miles to help and comfort me in my
    anguish. Were I as bad as I was painted, your kind old heart
    still pitied me; you were prepared to pluck me from the depths
    of despair and degradation. Why should I hate Lord Ventnor?
    What man could have served me as he did? He has given me Iris.
    He gained for me at her father's hands a concession such as
    mortal has seldom wrested from black-browed fate. He brought my
    uncle to my side in the hour of my adversity. Hate him! I would
    have his statue carved in marble, and set on high to tell all
    who passed how good may spring out of evil&mdash;how God's
    wisdom can manifest itself by putting even the creeping and
    crawling things of the earth to some useful purpose."</p>

    <p>"Dash it all, lad," vociferated the elder Anstruther, "what
    ails thee? I never heard you talk like this before!"</p>

    <p>The old gentleman's amazement was so comical that further
    tension was out of the question.</p>

    <p>Robert, in calmer mood, informed them of the manner in which
    he hit upon the mine. The story sounded like wildest
    romance&mdash;this finding of a volcanic dyke guarded by the
    bones of "J.S." and the poison-filled quarry&mdash;but the
    production of the ore samples changed wonder into
    certainty.</p>

    <p>Next day a government metallurgist estimated the value of
    the contents of the two oil-tins at about &pound;500, yet the
    specimens brought from the island were not by any means the
    richest available.</p>

    <p>And now there is not much more to tell of Rainbow Island and
    its castaways. On the day that Captain Robert Anstruther's name
    appeared in the <i>Gazette</i>, reinstating him to his rank and
    regiment, Iris and he were married in the English Church at
    Hong Kong, for it was his wife's wish that the place which
    witnessed his ignominy should also witness his triumph.</p>

    <p>A good-natured admiral decided that the urgent requirements
    of the British Navy should bring H.M.S. <i>Orient</i> to the
    island before the date fixed for the ceremony. Lieutenant
    Playdon officiated as best man, whilst the <i>Orient</i> was
    left so scandalously short-handed for many hours that a hostile
    vessel, at least twice her size, might have ventured to attack
    her.</p>

    <p>Soon afterwards, Robert resigned his commission. He
    regretted the necessity, but the demands of his new sphere in
    life rendered this step imperative. Mining engineers, laborers,
    stores, portable houses, engines, and equipment were obtained
    with all haste, and the whole party sailed on one of Sir Arthur
    Deane's ships to convoy a small steamer specially hired to
    attend to the wants of the miners.</p>

    <p>At last, one evening, early in July, the two vessels
    anchored outside Palm-tree Rock, and Mir Jan could be seen
    running frantically about the shore, for no valid reason save
    that he could not stand still. The sahib brought him good news.
    The Governor of Hong Kong felt that any reasonable request made
    by Anstruther should be granted if possible. He had written
    such a strong representation of the Mahommedan's case to the
    Government of India that there was little doubt the returning
    mail would convey an official notification that Mir Jan,
    formerly <i>naik</i> in the Kumaon Rissala&mdash;he who once
    killed a man&mdash;had been granted a free pardon.</p>

    <p>The mining experts verified Robert's most sanguine views
    after a very brief examination of the deposit. Hardly any
    preliminary work was needed. In twenty-four hours a small
    concentrating plant was erected, and a ditch made to drain off
    the carbonic anhydride in the valley. After dusk a party of
    coolies cleared the quarry of its former occupants. Towards the
    close of the following day, when the great steamer once more
    slowly turned her head to the north-west, Iris could hear the
    steady thud of an engine at work on the first consignment of
    ore.</p>

    <p>Robert had been busy up to the last moment. There was so
    much to be done in a short space of time. The vessel carried a
    large number of passengers, and he did not wish to detain them
    too long, though they one and all expressed their willingness
    to suit his convenience in this respect.</p>

    <p>Now his share of the necessary preparations was concluded.
    His wife, Sir Arthur and his uncle were gathered in a corner of
    the promenade deck when he approached and told them that his
    last instruction ashore was for a light to be fixed on Summit
    Rock as soon as the dynamo was in working order.</p>

    <p>"When we all come back in the cold weather," he explained
    gleefully, "we will not imitate the <i>Sirdar</i> by running on
    to the reef, should we arrive by night."</p>

    <p>Iris answered not. Her blue eyes were fixed on the
    fast-receding cliffs.</p>

    <p>"Sweetheart," said her husband, "why are you so silent?"</p>

    <p>She turned to him. The light of the setting sun! illumined
    her face with its golden radiance.</p>

    <p>"Because I am so happy," she said. "Oh, Robert, dear, so
    happy and thankful."</p>

    <h4>POSTSCRIPT</h4>

    <p>The latest news of Col. and Mrs. Anstruther is contained in
    a letter written by an elderly maiden lady, resident in the
    North Riding of Yorkshire, to a friend in London. It is dated
    some four years after the events already recorded.</p>

    <p>Although its information is garbled and, to a certain
    extent, inaccurate, those who have followed the adventures of
    the young couple under discussion will be able to appreciate
    its opinions at their true value. When the writer states facts,
    of course, her veracity is unquestionable, but occasionally she
    flounders badly when she depends upon her own judgment.</p>

    <p>Here is the letter:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"MY DEAR HELEN:</p>

        <p>"I have not seen or heard of you during so long a time
        that I am <i>simply dying</i> to tell you all that is
        happening here. You will remember that some people named
        Anstruther bought the Fairlawn estate near our village some
        three years ago. They are, as you know, <i>enormously</i>
        rich. The doctor tells me that when they are not squeezing
        money out of the wretched Chinese, they dig it in
        <i>barrow-loads</i> out of some magic island in the
        Atlantic or the Pacific&mdash;I really forget which.</p>

        <p>"Anyhow, they could afford to <i>entertain</i> much more
        than they do. Mrs. Anstruther is very nice looking, and
        could be a leader of society if she chose, but she
        <i>seems</i> to care for no one but her husband and her
        babies. She has a boy and a girl, very charming children, I
        admit, and you seldom see her without them. They have a
        French <i>bonne</i> apiece, and a most
        <i>murderous</i>-looking person&mdash;a Mahommedan native,
        I believe&mdash;stalks alongside and behaves as if he would
        <i>instantly decapitate</i> any person who as much as
        looked at them. Such a procession you never saw! Mrs.
        Anstruther's devotion to her husband is <i>too</i> absurd.
        He is a tall, handsome man, of distinguished appearance,
        but on the few occasions I have spoken to him he impressed
        me as somewhat <i>taciturn</i>. Yet to see the way in which
        his wife even <i>looks</i> at him you would imagine that he
        had not his equal in the world!</p>

        <p>"I believe there is some <i>secret</i> in their lives.
        Colonel Anstruther used to be in the army&mdash;he is now
        in command of our local yeomanry&mdash;and although his
        name is 'Robert,' <i>tout</i> <i>court</i>, I have often
        heard Mrs. Anstruther call him 'Jenks.' Their boy, too, is
        christened Robert <i>Jenks</i> Anstruther.' Now, my dear
        Helen, <i>do</i> make inquiries about them in town circles.
        I <i>particularly</i> wish you to find out who is this
        person 'Jenks'&mdash;a most vulgar name. I am sure you will
        unearth something curious, because Mrs. Anstruther was a
        Miss Deane, daughter of the baronet, and Anstruther's
        people are well known in Yorkshire. There are absolutely no
        Jenkses connected with them on either side.</p>

        <p>"I think I can help you by another <i>clue</i>, as a
        very <i>odd</i> incident occurred at our hunt ball last
        week. The Anstruthers, I must tell you, usually go away for
        the winter, to China, or to their fabulous island. This
        year they remained at home, and Colonel Anstruther became
        M.F.H., as he is certainly a most liberal man so far as
        <i>sport</i> and <i>charity</i> are concerned.</p>

        <p>"Well, dear, the Dodgsons&mdash;you remember the Leeds
        clothier people&mdash;having <i>contrived</i> to enter
        county society, invited the Earl of Ventnor down for the
        ball. He, it seems, knew nothing about Anstruther being
        M.F.H., and of course Mrs. Anstruther <i>received</i>. The
        moment Lord Ventnor heard her name he was very angry. He
        said he did not care to meet her, and left for London by
        the next train. The Dodgsons were <i>awfully</i> annoyed
        with him, and Mrs. Dodgson had the bad taste to tell Mrs,
        Anstruther all about it. And what do you think <i>she</i>
        said&mdash;'Lord Ventnor need not have been so frightened.
        My husband has not brought his hunting-crop with him!'</p>

        <p>"I was not there, but young Barker told me that Mrs.
        Anstruther looked very <i>impressive</i> as she said this.
        'Stunning!' was the word he used, but young Barker is a
        <i>fool</i>, and thinks Mrs. A. is the most beautiful woman
        in Yorkshire. Her dress, they say, was <i>magnificent</i>,
        which I can hardly credit, as she usually goes about in the
        <i>plainest</i> tailor-made clothes. By the way. I forgot
        to mention that the Anstruthers have restored our parish
        church. The vicar, of course, is enraptured with them. I
        dislike people who are so free with their money and yet
        reserved in their friendship. It is a sure sign, when they
        <i>court</i> popularity, that they dread something leaking
        out about the <i>past</i>.</p>

        <p>"<i>Do</i> write soon. Don't forget 'Jenks' and 'Lord
        Ventnor'; those are the lines of <i>inquiry</i>.</p>

        <p style="margin-left:50%;,margin-bottom:-1em;">"Yours,</p>

        <p class="author">"MATILDA.</p>

        <p>"PS.&mdash;Perhaps I am misjudging them. Mrs. Anstruther
        has just sent me an invitation to an 'At Home' next
        Thursday.&mdash;M.</p>

        <p>"PPS.&mdash;Dear me, this letter will never get away, I
        have just destroyed another envelope to tell you that the
        vicar came in to tea. From what he told me about Lord
        Ventnor, I imagine that Mrs. Anstruther said no more than
        he deserved.&mdash;M."</p>
        <br />
        <p class="note">NOTE.&mdash;Colonel Anstruther's agents
        discovered, after long and costly inquiry, that a Shields
        man named James Spence, a marine engineer, having worked
        for a time as a miner in California, shipped as third
        engineer on a vessel bound for Shanghai. There be quitted
        her. He passed some time ashore in dissipation, took
        another job on a Chinese river steamer, and was last heard
        of some eighteen months before the <i>Sirdar</i> was
        wrecked. He then informed a Chinese boarding-house keeper
        that he was going to make his fortune by accompanying some
        deep-sea fishermen, and he bought some stores and tools
        from a marine-store dealer. No one knew when or where he
        went, but from that date all trace of him disappeared. The
        only persons who mourned his loss were his mother and
        sister. The last letter they received from him was posted
        in Shanghai. Though the evidence connecting him with the
        recluse of Rainbow Island was slight, and purely
        circumstantial, Colonel Anstruther provided for the future
        of his relatives in a manner that secured their lasting
        gratitude.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
