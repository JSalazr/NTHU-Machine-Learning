<h2>
    ACT I
</h2>
<p class="exposition">
<i>The</i> SCENE <i>is the Italian Room in</i> ROSCOE CROSBY'S <i>Home in New York.
It is a handsome room. A plan of the setting will be found at the end of
the play. As the curtain rises</i> Miss HELEN O'NEILL <i>and</i> WILLIAM CROSBY
<i>are discovered standing</i> R.C. <i>They are in each other's arms, and the
rising curtain discloses them as they kiss. The window blinds are
drawn.</i>
</p>
<p>
HELEN. I love you so.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. You are the most wonderful thing in all the world.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>She gives a little laugh and moves away from him a step right</i>.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN. I can't believe it.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. That I love you?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Oh, no, I'm sure of that.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. If there's any doubt in your mind, I'll prove it again.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. They'll see us. (<i>He takes her in his arms again and kisses her.
She laughs happily. And then turning a little stands with her cheek
pressed against his.</i>) Oh, my dear, my dear!
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(MRS. CROSBY, <i>a fashionably dressed and extremely attractive woman,
enters from door down</i> L. <i>She closes the door. She stops for a moment
and watches the lovers and then with a little laugh comes toward them.</i>
MRS. CROSBY <i>is fifty-five and looks ten years younger. She has charm,
beauty and kindliness.</i>)
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>coming to</i> C. <i>a step</i>). Don't move, you look so
comfortable! (<i>They separate quickly.</i>) Well, are you happy? (<i>To</i> R.C.)
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Oh, mother!
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Happy!
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MRS. CROSBY <i>crosses to</i> HELEN, <i>pats her hand and stands between</i>
WILLIAM <i>and</i> HELEN R.C.)
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Shall we tell 'em all?
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. Tell them? (<i>She laughs</i>.) What do you think they are?
Blind and deaf? It's been a perfectly wonderful dinner. You were so
blind to everything but each other. Oh, Billy, I thought your father
would have a fit.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. I thought he had an awful cold, he was coughing terribly.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. Coughing? He nearly choked to keep from laughing. I told
him I'd send him from the table if he laughed at you.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Why you never spoke to him once.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. Child, explain to him that wives don't have to&mdash;Oh, I
forget you haven't learned that yet. You know, Billy, I can talk to your
father very effectively without words.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Crosses to below table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>turning to</i> MRS. CROSBY). Mrs. Crosby&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Mother, Nell's all fussed up because we've got money. She
thinks you'll think&mdash;I'm&mdash;what in novels they call marrying beneath me.
</p>
<p>
(<i>He and</i> MRS. CROSBY <i>laugh</i>. HELEN <i>looks a little hurt</i>.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Well, he is.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. Nonsense, child, don't be silly. (<i>Sits down stage end of
table</i>.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>moving a step to</i> MRS. CROSBY). It's not silly, Mrs. Crosby.
Everyone will say it, and they'll be right.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Let's settle this thing now once and for all, then. In the
first place it's all nonsense, and in the second it isn't true&mdash;
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Oh, yes, it is.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. Oh, the first row! I'll settle this one. Nelly!
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Now then, Nell, out with it, get it all out of your system.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. In the first place, it's the money.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. Yes, but&mdash;Helen&mdash;
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Please, let me say it all. You have social position, great
wealth, charming friends, everything that makes life worth&mdash;Oh, what's
the use? You know as well as I do the great difference between us, and&mdash;
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. My dear child, suppose we admit all that, what then?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. But don't you see&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>embracing her in front of table</i> R.). You little idiot!
I don't see anything but you.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. You love each other, that's the whole of it, children.
Suppose you listen to an old woman.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Old! Huh!
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. Well, old enough. If Billy was the usual rich man's son it
might be different. There might be something in what you say. But thank
God he isn't. Mind you, I don't say he wasn't like most of them when he
was younger. I dare say he was, I know he went to supper with a chorus
girl once.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Twice.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. What was she like?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Like a chorus girl.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. The trouble with you, my dear, is that you've been reading
novels. When Billy's father married me, I was a school teacher, and he
was a clerk. We didn't have any money, but we were awfully in love&mdash;we
still rather like each other. Now just for the sake of argument, suppose
we should have acted like stern parents, what would be the use? Billy's
in business for himself, he's making his own money, he can marry when he
wants to and as he wants to, and if you want my real opinion, I don't
mind confessing that I think he's pretty lucky to get you.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. There!
</p>
<p>
HELEN. But you know so little about me.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Oh, rot!
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>to</i> WILLIAM). Thank you, Billy. I was trying to think of
an effective word. (<i>To</i> HELEN.) You've been my private secretary for
over a year, and no matter how much my looks belie it, I'm not a bit of
a fool. I know a great deal about you.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. My family&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (C.). I'm not marrying your family!
</p>
<p>
HELEN. I'm afraid you are.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Oh!
</p>
<p>
HELEN. There's only mother.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>rising and moving to</i> HELEN'S <i>side in front of table</i>
R.). Oh, my dear, forgive me. Your mother should have been here
to-night.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. No, my mother&mdash;Mrs. Crosby&mdash;mother doesn't go out&mdash;she'd be
unhappy here, and you'd be uncomfortable if she came. You'll find her
trying sometimes, you'll think she's common. Oh, don't misunderstand me.
She's the most wonderful mother in the world. And she's&mdash;
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. Suppose, my dear, that we take your mother for granted.
(<i>She crosses to a position between</i> WILLIAM <i>and</i> HELEN.) Take us as
you find us and we will try to be happy.
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(<i>Enter</i> CROSBY <i>from door</i> L. <i>He is a fine-looking man of about sixty,
with a pleasant personality, a good deal of charm and that masterful
self-possession which sometimes marks the man of affairs. It is always
evident that the most delightful intimacy exists between himself and his
wife.</i>)
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. Well, Roscoe?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>moves to</i> L.C.). Welcome, my dear. (HELEN <i>crosses to him and
he takes her in his arms</i>.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Oh, Mr. Crosby&mdash;I&mdash;
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>placing</i> HELEN L. <i>of him with arm still around her, reaching
his other hand to</i> WILLIAM). Bill, shake!
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Father and son shake hands.</i>)
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(CROSBY <i>looks at his wife and they laugh gently.</i>)
</p>
<p>
Shall I tell 'em?
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>standing in front of table over</i> R.). I would.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (R.C.) Tell us what?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (C.). You did this just in time. To-morrow I was going to forbid
you to have anything more to do with this young woman.
</p>
<p>
HELEN (L. <i>of</i> CROSBY). You see!
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. What for?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Your mother and I felt that you were pretty slow with your
love-making&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Oh, mother!
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>continuing</i>).&mdash;and I knew darned well that if I interfered,
you'd take the girl out and marry her.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Oh!
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. You old schemer!
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>crossing over</i> R.C. <i>below</i> MRS. CROSBY). I bet it would have
worked.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>as</i> CROSBY <i>crosses</i> R. WILLIAM <i>slaps him on the back</i>).
It would. (<i>Crosses behind</i> HELEN <i>to</i> L.C.)
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>The door down</i> L. <i>opens and</i> EDWARD WALES <i>enters.</i>)
</p>
<p>
WALES. I came ahead of the others to tell you&mdash;
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Why, Ned, old man, you came just in time to congratulate them.
(<i>He points toward</i> WILLIAM <i>and</i> HELEN.)
</p>
<p>
WALES. On what? (L.C.)
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. They're going to be married: isn't it fine?
</p>
<p>
WALES. Oh!
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>There is a long pause.</i>)
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. You don't congratulate us, Mr. Wales.
</p>
<p>
WALES. No, Will, I don't. I'm not sure that I can. (<i>Down stage a step</i>.)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Why, Ned?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. I'm afraid that calls for an explanation.
</p>
<p>
WALES. Yes, I expect that it does.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>There is a long pause.</i>)
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Well?
</p>
<p>
WALES. I'm sorry, but I can't explain anything until to-morrow.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. But really, Mr. Wales, don't you think&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WALES. I think my action is almost indefensible. I'm admitting that. But
I have very good reasons for what I am doing. (<i>He turns to</i> CROSBY.)
Roscoe, I've been your close friend for a great many years. You've
trusted me and believed in me. I'm going to ask you to wait. After all,
twenty-four hours can't make any difference, and it may save you all a
great deal of unhappiness.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>coming to</i> WALES <i>a step</i>). This is intolerable.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Ned, I can't understand&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Father, this is my affair.
</p>
<p>
WALES. I'm sorry.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Sorry? I should think you would be.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Billy, I told you what would happen. Mr. Wales, I don't know what
you have discovered. But it's nothing of which I am ashamed, nothing.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Dear, you mustn't mind what he says.
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>crossing in front of</i> WILLIAM <i>and moving a few steps towards</i>
WALES). Oh, but I do, I can't bear it. Why, my mother is the most
wonderful woman in the world. I won't have her attacked. Do you know
what she did? When I was ten years old she sent me away from her. I was
the one thing she had in the world to love and she gave me up because
she thought&mdash;because she thought it was the best thing she could do for
me. I was sent to a fine school, then to college, and then when I was
nineteen, quite by accident, I found out that she wasn't dead, as they'd
always told me, and when I went to her all she said was, "Well, my dear,
I wanted to make a lady of you."
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Turns to</i> WILLIAM C. <i>He takes her in his arms, then</i> HELEN <i>moves
over to</i> R. <i>of him.</i>)
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>in front of table</i> R.). I think she succeeded, my dear.
</p>
<p>
WALES (L.C.). Miss O'Neill, I didn't even know that you had a mother.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (C.). Then you'd better tell us now whatever your objection is.
</p>
<p>
WALES. I can tell you nothing until to-morrow. (<i>He turns to</i> WILLIAM.)
Billy, I'd rather be shot than do what I'm doing. If I'm wrong I'll come
to you gladly and eat dirt. I'll beg this young lady's pardon, on my
knees if she likes. (<i>Voices and laughter heard off</i> L.) Now that's all
I'm going to say about it until then. (<i>Moves up</i> L.)
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(<i>The door</i> L. <i>opens</i>. MARY EASTWOOD, HELEN TRENT, ELIZABETH ERSKINE,
GRACE STANDISH, HOWARD STANDISH, PHILIP MASON <i>and</i> BRADDISH TRENT
<i>enter laughing and talking</i>.)
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>at</i> L.C. <i>To crowd in doorway</i>). And he said whose wife?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>All laugh</i>.)
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (C. HELEN <i>in front of table</i> R.). Quiet, quiet, everybody. I've
got a surprise for you.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>From the people at the door come laughter and buzz of conversation</i>.)
</p>
<p>
Nellie and I are going to be married.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Girls rush</i> C. <i>and congratulate</i> HELEN. <i>Men and</i> WILLIAM L.C.
<i>Business ad lib., congratulating him</i>.)
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>coming to</i> WILLIAM C.). If you hadn't been engaged to
her, she could have you arrested for the way you made eyes at her at
dinner, Billy. But of course, if people will marry&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;(<i>She turns
away</i> R.) I hope you will be awfully happy. (<i>Crosses to</i> MR. <i>and</i> MRS.
CROSBY <i>down</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
MISS ERSKINE (<i>coming to</i> WILLIAM). Isn't it beautiful? (<i>Moves up to</i>
L. <i>of chesterfield sofa</i>.)
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT (<i>crossing to</i> WILLIAM <i>and kissing him</i>). I'm glad, Billy,
glad.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Moves over to</i> STANDISH, <i>who is down</i> L. <i>with</i> TRENT. MISS STANDISH

</p>
<p>
WALES (<i>rises and moves down</i> L.C.). Can we see her now, Mrs. Crosby?

<p>
MRS. CROSBY. Certainly&mdash;Pollock, ask Madame la Grange if she will come
in, please.
</p>
<p>
BUTLER. Yes, madame.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>He exits and closes the door after him</i>.)
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>coming down between the large table and the

taken seriously?
</p>
<p>
MISS ERSKINE. Of course.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>at table</i> R.). How funny! If you don't laugh at her, we
can have no end of fun. I'll guy her terribly and she'll never know it.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>at table</i> R.). Oh, I wouldn't do that, Mary. She may be
quite in earnest.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. Oh, I can't believe that. Madame la Grange! I can see her
now. Tall, black-haired creature, regular adventuress, see if she isn't.
Isn't she, Mr. Wales?
</p>
<p>
WALES (<i>in front of chesterfield</i>). She's the most remarkable woman I

<p>
ROSALIE. Thank you, madame. (<i>She sees</i> WALES L.C., <i>and goes to him</i>.)
Good evening, Mister Wales. It was kind of you to send the motor-car for
me.
</p>
<p>
WALES. We wanted you to be comfortable.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. And I was. (<i>She laughs and turns to</i> MRS. CROSBY R.C.) Do you

ROSALIE. Oh, no, madame. I should like to see the policeman that could
frighten me. They are nice boys, the policemen.

MISS EASTWOOD (<i>on the</i> R. <i>side of</i> ROSALIE). Mr. Wales tells us you
are wonderful.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. All women are.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>with a meaning glance at the others</i>). So you tell
fortunes?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. No, mademoiselle, I do not. I get messages from those of us

<p>
Well, sir, and how are you?
</p>
<p>
WALES. We're expecting great things from you to-night, Madame la Grange.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Bien! I hope you will not be disappointed.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>above table</i> R., <i>coming</i> C. <i>a step</i>). I suppose there are a
lot of tricks that&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>interrupting him</i>). I suppose mine is the only trade in the
world in which there are tricks, eh, monsieur?
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>coming to</i> ROSALIE C.). Why shouldn't I meet Jimmy at
the Ritz to-morrow?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. If you do, something awful may 'appen to 'im.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. What?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. If you keep meeting Jimmy 'e may marry you.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MISS EASTWOOD <i>moves up stage a step</i>.)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>upper end of table</i> R.). Would you mind telling me how you know
this young lady was going to meet Jimmy at the Ritz to-morrow afternoon?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. She did leave 'is letter in 'er bag in the 'all, and while I
wait I 'ave read it.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (C.). How did you know it was my bag?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. The stuff of the bag matches the stuff of your dress.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>seated below table</i> R.). Then it is all trickery?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. It is, madame, and it is not. I tell you, madame, most of the
time it is tricks, with even the best of us. But there 'ave been times
in my life when it was not tricks. There 'ave been things I could not
understand myself, messages from them that 'ave passed on, madame. There
is a power&mdash;a wonderful power&mdash;that come to us. But you never can tell
when it is coming. And if you waited for it you would starve to death.
So when it is not there we use tricks.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>seated at lower end of table at</i> R.). I think I
understand.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Do you, madame? I thought you would.

</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>coming to</i> R.C.). Don't you think all this is dishonest!
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>in front of table</i> R., <i>turning to her</i>). What is dishonest in
it?
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. Tricking a lot of poor ignorant people.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. It is all in the way you look at it. A widow woman came to me
this mornin' with a breaking 'eart for the man that was gone. I went
into a trance and Laughing Eyes, my spirit control, came with a message
from 'im. She said 'e was in heaven with the angels, and there was no
cold nor 'unger; and the streets were paved with gold, and there was
music and 'appiness everywhere. She told 'er he was thinking of 'er
every day and every hour and watching and waiting for the day she would
come to 'im. Now wasn't that worth fifty cents of any woman's money? And
the man may be in 'ell for all I know!
</p>
<p>
TRENT (L.C. <i>by arm-chair</i>). What I can't understand is why you are
telling us all this.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MISS EASTWOOD <i>moves to the chesterfield</i> C.)
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT (<i>seated over L. by door</i>). If we know you are fooling&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>going to</i> TRENT). Did not Mr. Wales tell you?
</p>
<p>
WALES (L.C.). I've told them nothing.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MASON <i>drops down</i> R. <i>of chesterfield</i>, STANDISH <i>down</i> L. CROSBY <i>is</i>

<p>
ROSALIE (C.). Well, tell them now, if you please, sir. (<i>Moves to and

</p>
<p>
WALES (<i>down</i> L.). As I told you some time ago, Madame la Grange has
done a lot of things that we can't explain&mdash;-when I asked her to come
here to-night, she said she would under certain conditions.
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>between chesterfield and table</i>). You mean test conditions?
</p>
<p>
WALES. Not exactly. What she said was that no money should pass between
us, and that whatever she did, she would be honest.
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>very eagerly, and moving towards</i> ROSALIE). You mean that you
won't play any tricks?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. If I do, I will tell <i>you</i>.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>seated on chesterfield</i> C.). Of course we understand all
about spirit rappings.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. You do, eh?
</p>
<p>
STANDISH (<i>down</i> L.). Well, rather.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(CROSBY <i>sits</i> R. <i>end of chesterfield</i>.)

<p>
ROSALIE. Well, well, what do you think of that?

<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. You have to be near a table or something like that and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Maybe a chair or a desk would do?
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. And then in the dark&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. But of course in the dark. And you get one rap for yes and two
raps for no. (<i>There is a short pause</i>. ROSALIE <i>rises, comes down</i> C.

</p>
<p>
MASON (R.C.). Then if we get any messages&mdash;
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. If you get any messages? Well, sir, I am telling you the truth
now. Most of the time it is a fake. With me as with the others. But
to-night there will be no fake. I am a stranger to all of you except to
Mr. Wales. I do not know who live in this 'ouse. I do not know the name
of any one of you. Mr. Wales told me he wanted me to come 'ere, he said
he would send for me. (<i>Moves to</i> R. <i>end of chesterfield</i>.)
But 'e did not tell me one word about any of you;
</p>
<p>
WALES (<i>down</i> L.). That is quite true.
</p>
<p>
TRENT (<i>by arm-chair</i> L.C.). You haven't given her a hint of any sort?
</p>
<p>
WALES (L.). On my word of honour.
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>above table</i> R.). Madame la Grange.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Yes, sir?

<p>
MASON. I know a man who saw Palladino lift a table just by putting her
hands on it.

<p>
MASON. You mean without any trickery?

ROSALIE (<i>getting back of console table. Turning table around&mdash;narrow

ROSALIE (C.). Now you all do know what I can do, but I can trick you
too; so you will 'ave to take my word for it that I will not. I am not
making to you any promises. I will go into the trance for you and it
will be the real trance and not a fake. My spirit does control a little
girl named Laughing Eyes.

<p>
CROSBY. Are you asking us to believe that the spirit of a dead child&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (C.). To them that believe there is no death. Your own religion
teaches you that.

CROSBY. But not that the spirits of the dead can come back to earth.

<p>
ROSALIE (<i>moves to chair upper end of table</i> R. CROSBY <i>crosses to</i> R.

CROSBY (R.C.). If you will submit to the conditions we impose, Madame la
Grange, and then show us any manifestations, I will never scoff at
anything again.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Scoffing is the easiest thing anybody can do.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(CROSBY <i>crosses down</i> R. <i>below table</i>.)
</p>
<p>
If I could stop that even in one person, it would be a good thing. What
is it that you do want?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I want the window fastened.
</p>
<p>
MASON. That's the idea.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>coming in front of table</i> R.). Then we will have the doors
locked. Will that be all right?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Oh, certainly all right.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>coming down</i> L.C.). At the risk of seeming unnecessarily
sceptical, I'm going to suggest that we search Madame la Grange&mdash;that
is, of course, if she's willing.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MISS ERSKINE <i>and</i> MISS STANDISH <i>are at back of table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (C.). But why not? There are no 'oles in my stockings.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>All laugh</i>.)
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>down</i> R.). I suppose it's going to be difficult for you to get
results if we are all so antagonistic, Madame la Grange?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MISS EASTWOOD <i>goes up</i> L.C.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. It is, sir, and it is not. If there is any who wants to
communicate with any 'ere, maybe they can reach us. I do not know. I do
not understand you. I showed you all the tricks; would I have done that,
if I wanted to&mdash;to&mdash;fool you? Certainly I would not. Then why will you
not believe that I am 'onest?
</p>
<p>
WALES (<i>down</i> L.). I'm sure Madame la Grange is perfectly honest.
We've made certain stipulations to which she has agreed. I think we've
discussed matters enough already. We're ready if you are, Madame la
Grange.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I am ready.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(CROSBY <i>looks at window fastenings</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>seated at table over</i> R.). Do you know, I don't believe it
will be necessary to subject Madame la Grange to being searched. I'm
quite sure we can spare her that indignity.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I do not mind if you fine ladies will not be shocked at seeing
my plain lingerie.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(WALES <i>moves up</i> L. <i>General laugh</i>. Miss ERSKINE <i>joins</i> WILLIAM <i>and</i>
HELEN R.C.)
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>moving to</i> L. <i>of</i> ROSALIE C.). Come with me then, please.
I'm sure we won't be shocked. (<i>Aside to</i> ROSALIE.) I wear that kind
myself.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Truly, madame?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>They go to door</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>at door</i> L.), We shan't be long.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>at door</i> L.). Madame, would you mind if all the ladies come?
Then they will all be sure I am concealing nothing.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>The ladies all talk together and go out</i> L. WALES <i>closes the door
down</i> L. CROSBY <i>comes from lack of table</i> R. <i>to chesterfield</i>.)
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>by table</i> R.). Do you really want that window fastened?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(STANDISH <i>is behind the chair below the table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
WALES (L.C. CROSBY <i>and</i> TRENT <i>sit on corner of chesterfield</i>). I don't
care.
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>at table</i> R.). I'd like to make the test that way. I've a queer
feeling about that woman. I believe she really has power of some sort.
I know it seems funny, but&mdash;well, you all saw her lift that table.
I watched her carefully. There was no trick about it at all. I'm sure
of it.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. All right then. You fasten the window. Billy, you and Brad go
and get some chairs out of the dining-room. We'll need a lot.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(WALES <i>walks up and down</i> L. <i>of stage</i>. WILLIAM <i>and</i> TRENT <i>go out
door</i> R.C.)
</p>
<p>
You put them in a circle, don't you? (<i>Begins to place chairs in a
circle</i> C. <i>The chair</i> L. <i>of the fireplace is brought down and placed
in front of the chesterfield</i>.) What are you going to do, Wales? Ask her
a lot of questions?
</p>
<p>
WALES (L.). I'm going to try to find out who killed Spencer Lee.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Still harping on the murder of Spencer Lee?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(STANDISH <i>places the chairs above and below the table in the circle,
then the chair on the</i> R. <i>side of the fireplace in the circle</i>.)
</p>
<p>
WALES. Yes.
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>over</i> R.&mdash;<i>opening window curtains and raising window blind</i>).
Who was Spencer Lee?
</p>
<p>
WALES. The best friend I ever had.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(TRENT <i>and</i> WILLIAM <i>enter door</i> R.C., <i>each carrying two chairs. They
bring them down</i> R.C. <i>and exit</i> R.C.)
</p>
<p>
STANDISH (<i>placing chairs</i> C. <i>with backs to audience</i>). We all knew Lee
pretty well. And I know he was no good.
</p>
<p>
WALES (<i>moving to</i> L.C., <i>outside the circle</i>). You mustn't talk like
that about him, Standish!
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>inside the circle and coming down</i> C.). The man's dead: why not
let him rest in peace?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(STANDISH <i>outside of circle</i> L.C. <i>seat</i>.)
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. I didn't bring up the matter, you know, and I don't want to
hurt Ned's feelings, but I know that the police found a lot of
compromising letters and rotten things of that sort.
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(WILLIAM <i>and</i> TRENT <i>re-enter from</i> R.C., <i>each carrying two chairs.</i>
WILLIAM <i>crosses and places two chairs</i> R. <i>side of circle then goes
back to close the door</i>.)
</p>
<p>
WALES (L.C.). I don't care what they found, or what anyone thinks of
Lee: he was my best friend, and if I can find out who killed him I'm
going to do it. It was a damned brutal murder, stabbed in the back, poor
chap, with never a chance to fight for his life. (<i>Moves over</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>by table</i> R.). I don't seem to remember anything about the case.
</p>
<p>
WALES. It happened before you got back from France&mdash;no, by Jove, it
didn't either. It was a day or two after. I remember you and I had lunch
together the day you got home and I had dinner that night with Spencer.
Funny you don't remember anything about it.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(WILLIAM <i>sits</i> R. <i>in circle</i>.)
</p>
<p>
MASON. Well, of course, I must have seen it in the papers, but I don't
go in much for crimes, and not knowing the man I wasn't interested.
</p>
<p>
STANDISH (<i>sitting in circle</i> L.C.). It was a good deal of a sensation.
The man knew a lot of nice people. Came here a good deal, didn't he,
Mr. Crosby?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>sitting in circle up</i> C.). At one time. But after Helen married
he rather dropped out of it. Fact is, until Trent here appeared on the
scene he was always hanging around.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(TRENT <i>comes down and sits in</i> R. <i>side of circle</i>.)
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. Funny they never found out who killed him.
</p>
<p>
WALES (<i>standing outside of circle</i>, L. <i>side</i>). They may not. They
haven't stopped trying.
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>seated on table</i> R.). Oh, are the police still interested?
</p>
<p>
WALES. Yes, they're interested. As a matter of fact there's a reward of
five thousand dollars for the discovery of the murderers.
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. Are you sure of that?
</p>
<p>
WALES. I offered it.
</p>
<p>
TRENT. You?
</p>
<p>
WALES. Yes. What sort of a man do you think I am? Do you expect me to
sit still and let the murderers of Spencer Lee go free? Why, I'd known
the man all his life. We were the closest friends.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. But if he was the kind of a man that Standish says&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WALES. I don't give a damn what he was. He was my friend, and I'm never
going to rest till I find out who killed him.
</p>
<p>
TRENT. But.
</p>
<p>
WALES. I wouldn't care so much if they'd given the poor devil half a
chance for his life, but they stabbed him in the back.
</p>
<p>
MASON. Wasn't there any indication&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WALES. There wasn't a thing to show who did it, or how it was done. A
knife-wound between the shoulder-blades and no knife ever found. Nothing
stolen, nothing disturbed. The police have found out that a young woman
called to see him that afternoon, two or three hours before his body was
discovered. That's all that we know.
</p>
<p>
TRENT (<i>with a laugh&mdash;still seated in circle</i>). And now you're going to
try spiritualism?
</p>
<p>
WALES. Why not? (<i>There is a pause.</i>) Do any of you object?
</p>
<p>
TRENT. Certainly not. I'm rather for it.
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>rises, still on</i> L. <i>of table</i> R.). You are doing this
seriously? This is not a joke?
</p>
<p>
WALES. Quite seriously. (<i>There is a pause.</i>) Well, why won't somebody
laugh?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. My dear fellow, why should anyone laugh? This queer old woman
may have powers of which we know nothing at all. Personally, I haven't
much belief in that sort of thing, but I'm not going to laugh at it.
(<i>Rise.</i>) Neither am I going to have any trickery, or if there is any
I'm going to expose it.
</p>
<p>
WALES (<i>over</i> L.). That's perfectly fair.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. You've been at her sances, or whatever they call them, before?
</p>
<p>
WALES. Yes.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. In the dark?
</p>
<p>
WALES. Invariably.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I may want light. (<i>He turns to his son.</i>) Billy, if I call for
lights you give them to me. Don't wait for anything. Understand?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Perfectly, dad.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(WILLIAM <i>goes up to small table</i> R. <i>of chesterfield. Brings table with

ROSALIE. Oh, madame, I did not mind.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MRS. CROSBY <i>crosses back of chesterfield to up</i> R.C.)
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>down</i> L.). I can assure you there isn't anything up her

<p>
ROSALIE. Well, what did you expect? Burglar's tools?

<p>
ROSALIE. That is right. You cannot be too careful, eh?

CROSBY. And now, if you don't mind, I'm going to lock the doors and keep
the keys in my pocket.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Anything you do wish, sir. It is all the same to me.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Goes inside circle and sits down up</i> C. <i>in circle</i>.)
</p>
<p>
MASON (R.C.). May I see that it's done, Mr. Crosby?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (L.C., <i>with a laugh</i>). Can't you trust me?
</p>
<p>
MASON. It isn't that&mdash;I&mdash;well, I just want to be sure. To see for myself.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Lock that one yourself, then. (<i>Indicating door</i> R.C. MASON
<i>goes to and locks the door</i>. CROSBY <i>goes to door</i> L.C., <i>locks it,

(MASON <i>crosses to door</i> L.C.&mdash;<i>shows it is locked</i>.) Now well do this
one. (<i>He starts to door down</i> L. <i>Then stops suddenly</i>.) No, I've got a
better way than this. My dear, will you ring for Pollock?
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>upper end of table</i> R.). What are you going to do now?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Wait and see. (<i>To</i> ROSALIE.) You don't object to this?

ROSALIE. Oh, no, sir.

</p>
<p>
POLLOCK. Yes, sir.

<p>
CROSBY (L.C.). Now then, I want you to take the key out of that door,
and lock it on the outside, understand?
</p>
<p>
POLLOCK. Perfectly, sir.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Then take the key from the lock and put that one in your pocket
also, after that you are to stand outside that door, and you are not to
unlock it until I tell you to. Understand?
</p>
<p>
POLLOCK. Yes, sir, I'm to lock this door on the outside, keep the key in
my pocket, and then stay just outside, and not open it for anyone until
you tell me.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Exactly. (<i>General buzz of conversation.</i> POLLOCK <i>goes to the
door</i> L., <i>takes out the key and exits, closing the door after him. The
key is heard turning in the lock.</i>) Now then, Mason, you'd better try
that door, too. (MASON <i>goes over and tries the door</i> L. CROSBY <i>follows

</p>
<p>
POLLOCK (<i>outside.</i>) Yes, sir.

CROSBY. And the keys are in your pocket?

POLLOCK. Quite so, sir.

I've always understood that was necessary.

ROSALIE. We shall 'ave better results in that way.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Right! (<i>He rises, goes to door</i> L., <i>and switches off light.

that light as soon as we are ready.

<p>
WILLIAM. Right you are, dad.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. That is all, then. Now you are not to be afraid if I cry or
moan when I do go into a trance. I am not in pain or anything like that.
I do not even know that I do such things, but I 'ave been told that
it sometime 'appen. My spirit control is a sweet little child named
Laughing Eyes. When she begins to talk you can ask 'er anything you do
want. If she do not answer you she do not want to talk to you. Then
whoever it is speaking must let someone else try. That is all, ladies
and gentlemen. (<i>She settles back in her chair.</i>) Now then, sir,
please to put out that light.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(WILLIAM <i>turns off the light, and the stage is in darkness all but

</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>They all start to speak.</i>)
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT. It's a trick.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Yes, it is a trick. (<i>They stop and stare at her. Her manner is
commanding, and a little stern.</i>) I was going to ask you to tie my 'ands
to the arm of the chair, but I thought I would show you this first.
</p>
<p>
MASON. I don't see how you did it&mdash;even now.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>standing outside of circle</i> L.). Things 'appen in the dark.
The sense of touch is not much developed except in those who are blind.
When this young gentleman did let go my 'and to turn out the light,
I did take my other 'and away from Mr. Crosby and when we joined 'ands
again the two gentlemen were 'olding 'ands as comfortable as you please.
And I was free. It is an old trick. All the mediums do use it. Anyone
can do it. (<i>She moves back to her chair and sits.</i>) Now, if someone
will tie me in, we will go on.
</p>
<p>
MASON. How do we know that you can't get free even then?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Tie me so that I cannot.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>rising</i>). I'll see to that. I want something strong.
</p>
<p>
MASON. Take handkerchiefs, they are strong enough. (<i>Takes handkerchief.</i>)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. They'll do very well. (<i>Takes out his own.</i>) I want three more.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Here's mine. (<i>Hands his handkerchief to his father.</i> MASON

</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Now, Madame la Grange, if you don't mind. (<i>He ties her hands to
the arm of the chair.</i>) I don't see why you did that just now.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I told you I wanted to be sure.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Why?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Because I think something is going to 'appen. I think there
will be manifestations. I wanted you to know I was not faking.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. Why should we think that you were?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Why, you 'ave thought nothing else ever since I did come into
the room.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Mason, see if she can get free from that now.

ROSALIE. Well, now, if you will all sit down, please&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Pause.</i>)
You will have to reach over and take my hands this time&mdash;are you all
satisfied now? Is there anything more you want me to do? (<i>There is no

(<i>Pause.</i>) (<i>Knife is set down in sight of audience, sticking in the

<p>
VOICE. Ned, I want Ned&mdash;why in <i>Hell</i> doesn't Ned answer?

ROSALIE (<i>in child's voice</i>). He wants to talk to Ned&mdash;is Ned here?
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. Ned who? Who is it? Who does he want to speak to?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>in child's voice</i>). Tell Ned it is Spencer&mdash;Spencer wants
to tell Ned about the letters and the pain in the back&mdash;in the back.
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. What was in the back? (<i>There is no answer.</i>) Ask him what was
in the back?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>still using child's voice</i>). The knife&mdash;Ned&mdash;he wants Ned.
</p>
<p>
WALES. What do you want!
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. A swimming pool&mdash;do not forget the swimming pool. Do not ever
forget&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WALES. You mean the time he went in after me when I was drowning? When
we were little boys? Is that what he wants me to remember?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Spencer says he cannot rest&mdash;he wants to tell you it is hard to
reach&mdash;too far away&mdash;you promised&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WALES. Promised what? When did I promise!
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Your life saved&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WALES. Now I know&mdash;I told him I'd do anything in the world for him.
Spencer, of course, I remember&mdash;what do you want me to do?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Find&mdash;find&mdash;&mdash;

<p>
WALES. Do you want me to find the letters?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. In the back&mdash;someone came&mdash;someone came.
</p>
<p>
WALES. You're trying to tell who killed you?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Ask&mdash;ask&mdash;ask.
</p>
<p>
WALES. You want me to ask questions? Is that it? You mean you can't talk
much?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Too far away.

<p>
CROSBY. You know who killed you?
</p>
<p class="stagec">

<p>
ROSALIE. He says Ned, he wants Ned.

<p>
ROSALIE. He wants Ned to ask.

<p>
WALES. Do you know who killed you?

<p>
MRS. TRENT (<i>hysterically</i>). Oh, my God!
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Keep still, Helen.
</p>
<p>
WALES. Can you tell the name? (ROSALIE <i>suddenly gives a long moan.</i>)
Quick, the name, the name. Spencer, tell me who killed you&mdash;she's coming
out of her trance. I want the name. (ROSALIE <i>moans again. Her cry is
overtopped by a shriek from</i> WALES.) Oh, my God! My back&mdash;oh! (<i>Then
there is a dead silence that lasts as long as it will hold.</i>)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Wales, is anything the matter?
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT. Father, he's pulling at my hand.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. The light, Will.
</p>

CROSBY. Stand back, please. (<i>The others move back a little.</i> CROSBY

POLLOCK (<i>outside</i>). Yes, sir.

MRS. TRENT. It can't be. He was talking and&mdash;&mdash;

MRS. CROSBY. Roscoe, are you sure? Hadn't we better send for a doctor?

CROSBY. Murdered!
</p>
<p>
TRENT (<i>rises</i>). What?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Mr. Wales was stabbed in the back, just as Spencer Lee was
stabbed in the back.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT (<i>rising and moving to</i> CROSBY). Father, please let me go to
my room.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. It is impossible, my dear.
</p>
<p>
TRENT. But, Mr. Crosby&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Comes down to</i> CROSBY L.)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>interrupting him</i>). It's quite impossible.
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(MRS. TRENT <i>goes to and sits in chair up</i> L., <i>followed by</i> TRENT, <i>who
stands</i> R. <i>side of her.</i> WILLIAM <i>sits back of table</i> R. HELEN <i>sits

</p>
<p>
STANDISH (<i>below table over</i> R.). Mr. Crosby, I must&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Mr. Standish, I just refused to let my own daughter leave the
room.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Slight pause.</i>)
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. But don't you see, sir&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. My dear Standish, poor Wales was killed by someone in this room.
We are all of us under suspicion. Everyone of us. (<i>Slight movement
from all.</i>) It's an awful thing to say&mdash;but one of us in this room
has killed Wales. Which one of us?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Knock on door down</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Yes.
</p>
<p>
POLLOCK (<i>outside</i>). The police are here, sir.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Who is it?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>outside</i>). Inspector Donohue.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Pollock, give Inspector Donohue all the keys.
</p>
<p>
POLLOCK (<i>outside</i>). Yes, sir.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>There is a pause.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>outside</i>). What is all this?
</p>
<p>
POLLOCK (<i>outside</i>). I don't know, I'm sure. I was told to lock the
door. I don't know what's been going on inside. Then I was told to call
you. This is the right key for that door.
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(<i>The noise of the key being put into the lock can be heard, then
the click as it is turned in the lock, then the door is opened, and</i>
INSPECTOR DONOHUE <i>in plain clothes comes well on stage</i> L. <i>He is seen
to be a clean-cut, intelligent-looking man of fifty. It later develops
that he is reserved and extremely quiet in manner. He speaks like a
gentleman and acts like one.</i> SERGEANT DUNN <i>enters also and drops below
door</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Where's Mr. Wales?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (L.C.). How did you know that Wales&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (L. <i>of</i> CROSBY, <i>interrupting him</i>). I don't know anything. I
was thinking of something else. I was told that I was wanted here in a
hurry.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Queer your asking for Wales. Mr. Wales is dead; that's why I
sent for you.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Wales is what?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Wales is dead.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>still seated</i> R.C.). Yes, and if you ask me&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Just a minute, please, miss. (<i>He turns to</i> CROSBY.) It must
have been very sudden. Why, only this afternoon I&mdash;&mdash; Did he ask you to
send for me?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (L.C.). Inspector, you don't seem to understand. Mr. Wales was
murdered in this room not fifteen minutes ago.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Other characters keep the same positions as when the curtain rose.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>his manner changing abruptly</i>). Mike! That door! (SERGEANT
DUNN <i>closes door</i> L. <i>and stands in front of it.</i>) Where have you taken
him?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>pointing to the chesterfield</i> C.). There.
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(DONOHUE <i>goes up</i> L. <i>end of chesterfield to</i> C. <i>and stands looking
down on the body. There is a long pause, and then slowly raising his
head looks with terrible deliberation at each person in the room.</i> MASON
<i>moves to</i> R. <i>end of chesterfield.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Who did this?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. We don't know.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>very quietly</i>). Then I expect we'll have to find out. (<i>He
comes down by the</i> R. <i>end of the chesterfield and stops when he sees</i>
ROSALIE. <i>He gives a short laugh as he sees how she is tied to the
chair.</i>) What's this?
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>rises</i>). Good Heavens, we forgot to untie her! I'm so
sorry.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Thank you, madame. I am quite comfortable. I will stay as I am
if you do not mind.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. But&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I think we'll leave things as they are for the present.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MRS. CROSBY <i>resumes the same seat as before.</i>)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. A policeman with brains! Oh, la-la!
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Let's see if he can't use them then. (<i>Moving to </i> CROSBY
<i>down</i> L.C. <i>and standing on his</i> R. <i>side.</i>) Now, Mr. Crosby, tell me
exactly what happened.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I know it sounds foolish, but we were having a spiritualistic
seance. Madame la Grange is a medium.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I see.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. We were sitting in the dark, in a circle, you know, holding
hands. Suddenly Wales cried out. I called to my son to turn on the
light. He did so. Wales was leaning forward in his chair. His hands were
in those of the people he sat between, and all the rest of us were
sitting around.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. All of you?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Yes.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I thought you told your son to turn on the lights.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. If you're implying that&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I'm not implying anything, and please answer my questions.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>rises, and stands back of table</i> R.). Inspector, I was sitting
there, and simply made a move to turn on the light. I had chosen the
seat purposely. We wanted to expose trickery, if we found any.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I understand. (<i>He turns again to</i> CROSBY.) Go on, Mr. Crosby.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. In a moment poor Wales fell to the floor. I ran to him and found
that he had been stabbed in the back. Before we could call for aid, he
was dead.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Did he say anything?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. No. I think that he was dead before we got to him.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. What happened then?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. As soon as I realized what had happened I sent for you.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Why for <i>me</i>? Why not simply notify the police? I mean, was
there any special reason for wanting <i>me</i>?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. There was, but I wasn't conscious of it at the time. We'd been
talking about the killing of Spencer Lee earlier in the evening, and
I suppose that subconsciously I remembered that you were handling that
case, which brought yours as the first name to my mind. That's all.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I see. (<i>Going </i>C.<i> a few steps.</i>) Now then, who's been in or
out of this room since? Of course, you know you had no right to move Mr.
Wales.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (L.C.). Yes, I know, but I couldn't let him lie there on the
floor. It was a little too much. You see we were all locked in here and
and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Locked in! You mean as I found you when I came?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Exactly. We had all of the windows fastened and all doors locked
for the sance. Pollock had the keys, I refused to let him open the door
until you came.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Mr. Crosby, you are forgiven for breaking the Coroner's rules.
As I understand, then, you were sitting in this room with the doors and
windows locked; you were in the dark. Wales was stabbed in the back, the
lights were turned on, and no one has left the room or entered since?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. No one but you.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I didn't kill him. (<i>There is a long pause, then he turns
with a sweeping gesture.</i>) Which one of you did? (<i>Slight movement
from others. There is another long pause. No one speaks. He moves
very quietly down</i> R.C. <i>to below table</i> R.) Now, I'm not going to
employ the usual police methods. There is to be no threatening or
badgering. But you all can see that there can be no escape for the
guilty person. I realize that this is a terrible situation for all of
you, but the only way to relieve it is for the murderer of Mr. Wales
to confess. (<i>Another pause.</i>) It will save a long, and I assure you,
a very trying police investigation. Let me say also that there will be
no recriminations, no unpleasant scenes. I realize that this seems a
very weak plea for a confession. But I am counting on the intelligence
of the people now in this room. (<i>He takes out his watch and holds it
face upward in his hand.</i>) I have unlimited time, but not a great
deal of patience. Well? (<i>There is another long pause. He finally
replaces his watch with a little gesture of finality.</i>) Very well
then. (<i>He turns suddenly to</i> MISS EASTWOOD, <i>who is still seated
up</i> R.C.) What is your name?
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. Mary Eastwood.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. A moment ago, Miss Eastwood, you started to tell me something.
You said, "If you ask me&mdash;" Now I am asking you. What was it you wanted
to tell me?
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>seated</i> R. <i>of console table</i> R.). I don't
want to especially. But I think I ought to tell you this. No one else
seems to have thought of it. When the sance started we were all sitting
in a circle holding each others' hands. As I understand it&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. We can take it for granted that I know how that is done. Go on,
please.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. The medium got out of the circle without our knowing it,
and then showed us how she did the trick.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I see.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. Why couldn't she have done it again? Of course, that's
what someone did, isn't it? And if she could get out of the circle
without our knowing it, she could get back in again, couldn't she?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(HELEN <i>rises.</i> MISS EASTWOOD <i>continues with an air of triumph.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<i>That's</i> what I wanted to tell you.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. If any one of you, or all of you, can get me out of this chair
without untying me or cutting me loose, I will say that I 'ave done that
murder.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(HELEN <i>sits above table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Thank you, Miss Eastwood. It's only fair to tell you that there
isn't a trick or an effect that these people do that the police do not
understand perfectly.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Is that so?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DONOHUE <i>goes over and examines the way in which</i> ROSALIE <i>is tied
to the chair.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Why was she tied up?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>down</i> L.C.). At her own request. As Miss Eastwood says,
she showed us how she broke out of the circle and then suggested that we
tie her into that chair to make sure she didn't do it again.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (R. <i>of</i> ROSALIE'S <i>chair</i>). It's lucky for her that she did.
Even if she had slipped out of those knots, there's no way in the world
that she could get back in.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I did say this policeman 'ad brains. (DONOHUE <i>turns away
from her.</i>) Get me loose, dear Inspector. My foot 'e sleeps.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DONOHUE <i>turns back and unties handkerchiefs with which she is tied.
She gets up and stands in front of arm-chair</i> C.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Thank you very much, Miss Eastwood, that eliminates one.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Then I can go? (<i>Starting for door</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. You cannot.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(ROSALIE <i>goes</i> R. <i>of arm-chair and sits</i> R. <i>end of chesterfield</i> C.)
</p>
<p>
Anyone else anything they want to tell me? (<i>Pause.</i>) No? Mike, you'd
better 'phone the Coroner and ask him to come up here. Tell him I do not
want the case reported yet. And suggest that he hurries.
</p>
<p>
DUNN. Yes, Inspector.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>He turns and exits</i> L., <i>leaving the door open behind him.</i> STANDISH
<i>and</i> TRENT <i>start towards door</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>turning to them</i>). That open door does not mean freedom for
any of you yet.
</p>
<p>
TRENT (<i>coming to</i> DONOHUE C.). I'm awfully sorry, Inspector, but I've
an important business engagement at ten o'clock. My father-in-law here
will&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. That's quite impossible.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(TRENT <i>goes up</i> L. <i>again and stands</i> L. <i>side of</i> MRS. TRENT.)
</p>
<p>
STANDISH (<i>moving to</i> L.C.). That is all very well, Inspector, but you
know you can't keep us in this room for ever. If you want to take the
consequences of accusing me of murder, well, that's your affair. But my
patience is exhausted and I haven't the slightest intention of remaining
here much longer. Unless, of course, you are planning to arrest me.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (C.). I see. By the way, who are you?
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. Howard Standish, of Standish, Giles &amp; Updegraff, 120 Broadway.
My brother is Judge Standish of the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. And you refuse to remain here any longer?
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. I do.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Very well, Mr. Standish of Standish, Giles &amp; Updegraff. You are
arrested as a material witness in this case. As soon as Sergeant Dunn
returns he will call a patrol wagon and take you down to the House of
Detention. (<i>Turns and crosses</i> R.) Are there any others who insist on
leaving this room?
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. I beg your pardon, Inspector. I acted like a fool.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MASON R. <i>of chesterfield</i> C.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Not at all, sir, your actions are entirely natural.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(STANDISH <i>goes up</i> L. DUNN'S <i>voice is heard outside.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DUNN. Hello! Hello! No, sir. But Inspector Donohue wants you to come
here at once. We're at Mr. Roscoe Crosby's house. No, sir (DONOHUE
<i>crosses over and closes the door</i> L.), he doesn't want the case
reported yet.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. We needn't be bothered with that, anyway. (<i>Moves back to</i> R.C.
<i>There is a pause.</i>) Well, I'm afraid we'll have to begin work. (<i>He
goes over to table</i> R. <i>and sits down stage end of table. Takes paper
and gets pencil.</i>) With the exception of Mr. Crosby, who is known to
nearly everyone, and Mr. Standish, who has so pleasantly introduced
himself to me, I know none of you. So I'll have to ask&mdash; (<i>He stops
suddenly and rises, facing them all. He points slowly to the
chesterfield, facing fireplace up</i> C.) That's rather a gruesome thing
there. I think we'll move it into another room. Will some of you
gentlemen carry Mr. Wales' body into the other room. (<i>There is a pause.
The men all hesitate. Finally</i> MASON <i>starts to move to chesterfield.</i>
DONOHUE <i>is down stage</i> R.C.) Thank you very much. We'll&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Coming to</i> C. DUNN <i>enters from</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
DUNN. Dr. Bernstein himself is on the way here, Inspector.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Good! Mike, get one of the servants to help you to carry this
sofa into another room.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DUNN <i>turns and exits</i> L. <i>without speaking.</i>)
</p>
<p>
I won't have to trouble you after all, sir.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MASON <i>drops down to console table</i> R. <i>of chesterfield.</i> DONOHUE
<i>gives a little laugh.</i>)
</p>
<p>
Funny how these old superstitions cling to us. One of the first tests
for guilt invented by detectives was to ask a supposed murderer to touch
the body of his victim. (<i>Slight pause.</i>) The test didn't work very
well, did it? Certainly you four gentlemen can't all be guilty. (<i>Slight
pause.</i>) Well, we'll have to try something else. (<i>Very impressively.</i>)
Because, you know, I really am going to arrest the murderer of Edward
Wales to-night.
</p>
<p>
(DUNN <i>enters from</i> L., <i>followed by</i> POLLOCK.)
</p>
<p>
Carry the sofa into another room, please.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>down</i> L.). Into that room, please. (<i>Indicating door</i> L.C.)

</p>
<p>
DUNN (<i>at door</i> L.C.). The door is locked.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (C.). Oh, yes, try these keys.

<p>
And, Mike!
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DUNN <i>turns his head.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DUNN. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Make as quick an examination as you can and report to me here.
(<i>The men exit carrying sofa into room</i> L.C. DONOHUE <i>crosses to chair

</p>
<p>
As I started to say a moment ago, I shall have to find out something
about each of you. You, madam? (<i>He turns to</i> MRS. CROSBY.)
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>seated in arm-chair</i> C.). I'm Alicia Crosby. Mrs. Roscoe
Crosby.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>He makes notes on paper in front of him.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I'm sorry to trouble you, Miss&mdash;(<i>He points his pencil at</i> MISS
ERSKINE, <i>seated</i> L.C.)
</p>
<p>
MISS ERSKINE. Elizabeth Erskine. I'm&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. It's not necessary to tell your age.
</p>
<p>
MISS ERSKINE. I wasn't going to. I'm the daughter of Edward Erskine, my
father is the banker.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I know him. Thank you. You are then merely a guest here?
</p>
<p>
MISS ERSKINE. A friend.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Miss Eastwood, I already know. And you, miss?
</p>
<p>
MISS STANDISH. Grace Standish.
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. My sister.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Oh! And this young lady?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>puts his hand on</i> MRS. TRENT'S <i>shoulder</i> L.C.). My daughter,
Mrs. Trent. She and Trent here live with us.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. And you, sir?
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>there is a pause</i>). Philip Mason. (<i>At upper end of table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. That doesn't tell me very much.
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>with a laugh</i>). There isn't very much to tell. I'm just a friend
of the family. We've known, each other for years. I've lived in Paris
for the last two or three years. I'm a painter.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. You mean an artist?
</p>
<p>
MASON. Well, I don't paint houses or fences, but I'd hardly call myself
an artist&mdash;yet.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Poor, I suppose? I know you'll pardon that question, won't you?
</p>
<p>
MASON. Quite all right, I assure you. No, I'm not poor.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Thank you. (<i>Turns toward</i> WILLIAM, <i>who is standing back of</i>
HELEN'S <i>chair above table</i> R.) And you?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. I'm young Crosby.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I see. Live here, I suppose?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Certainly, where else should I live?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I thought perhaps you might be married.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (L.C.). He's not, but if he were he'd live with us and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. No, father. When I marry I've got to have my own home and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Nonsense. Don't talk like a fool. You'd live here with me and
your mother&mdash;and your wife, of course.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I think perhaps we'd better defer that discussion, gentlemen.
(<i>He turns toward</i> HELEN.) And this young lady?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. My fiance, Miss O'Neill.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Well, that finishes that. (<i>Rises, standing below table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. But, Inspector, you haven't asked anything about the medium?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Perhaps I don't consider that necessary, Miss Eastwood.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. But&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. And I'm terribly set on conducting this investigation in my own
way, if you don't mind.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Enter</i> DUNN <i>from</i> L.C.)
</p>
<p>
DUNN. Inspector!
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Well?
</p>
<p>
DUNN (<i>at door</i> L.C.). I can't tell for sure, but I guess the knife went
clean into the heart. He must have died instantly.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. All right. Let me know when the Coroner arrives. (DUNN <i>starts
toward door down</i> L.) And, Dunn!
</p>
<p>
DUNN. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>going</i> C.). You'd better let me have a look at that knife.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DUNN <i>turns sharply and looks at him.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DUNN (<i>down</i> L.). The knife?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Yes, the knife.
</p>
<p>
DUNN. I haven't seen any knife. I thought you had it.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. No. I haven't seen it. (<i>There is a long pause.</i> DONOHUE <i>is</i>
R. <i>of</i> CROSBY.) Mr. Crosby?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>still</i> L.C.). We didn't find it.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Look carefully?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Everywhere. While we were waiting for you.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Who moved Mr. Wales' body?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I did.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. No one else touched him?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. No one.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. What did you do, after you had carried him to the sofa?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I saw that he had been stabbed. I looked for the knife.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Where?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. On the floor, under the stairs, everywhere I could think of.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. No trace of it?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. None.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. What did you do then?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Nothing. I waited for you.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. How long after you found that Mr. Wales was killed did you turn
on the lights?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Why, I told you; we turned on the light before we found what had
happened.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Would it have been possible for the murderer to have hidden it
about the room?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I doubt it very much.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Why?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I don't think there would have been time. I don't see how anyone
could have done it at all. It's all a mystery to me. I told you the
circle was intact. You remember?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>There is a pause.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Yes, I remember. Then if the knife was hidden, it's probably on
the person of the man or woman who used it.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I think so, undoubtedly.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Mike, 'phone over to the station house and have them send a
matron over here.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DUNN <i>exits</i> L., <i>and closes the door after him.</i>)
</p>
<p>
Now about that light. There was just one lamp turned on as I remember.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Someone turned on the rest of the lights, almost immediately.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Could the knife have been hidden about the room, since that time?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. It's extremely unlikely. We have all been here together. A thing
of that sort would have been seen.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Then I expect we'll find it without much trouble. (<i>There is
a pause, as he looks slowly at each person individually in the room.</i>
WILLIAM <i>puts arm on</i> HELEN'S <i>shoulders as</i> DONOHUE <i>looks at him.</i>)
In the meantime, I think we'll let it remain where it is. (<i>Crosses
down</i> R. <i>He turns with a gesture which takes them all in.</i>) You see
how inevitably the guilty person must be discovered. Don't you think it
would be much simpler to confess? (<i>Pause.</i>) No? Then I suppose we will
have to continue. (<i>Crosses up</i> L., <i>takes a chair and places it</i> L.
<i>side of circle, then he takes the chair down</i> L. <i>and places that in
lower left-hand side of circle.</i> CROSBY <i>moves to</i> C.) I'd like to
visualize the scene a little more clearly. (TRENT <i>places chair</i> L.
<i>side of circle.</i>) Let's form that circle again&mdash;(<i>Turns two single
chairs down</i> C. <i>around with backs to audience. Crosses and gets chair
in front of table and places it in lower right-hand side of circle.</i>
MRS. CROSBY, MISS ERSKINE, MRS. TRENT, TRENT <i>and</i> MISS STANDISH <i>rise
and move to the</i> L. <i>of the circle.</i>) Of course this time without Mr.
Wales. (MISS EASTWOOD <i>rises and stands at</i> R. <i>end of chesterfield.
During these last few speeches of</i> DONOHUE, TRENT <i>and</i> CROSBY <i>have
placed the remainder of chairs in the circle.</i>) All sit as you were
sitting at the sance.
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(<i>There is a general movement</i>. STANDISH <i>crosses</i> R. <i>to above table</i>
R. <i>The minute this suggestion is made</i> ROSALIE <i>comes down, nearer to</i>
DONOHUE, <i>and looks at him anxiously. Something in his suggestion
greatly disturbs her</i>.)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>in upper</i> L. <i>side of circle</i>). Will, you were there by the
lamp, and Madame la Grange was next to you, and I was next to her&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Then how did they sit? (<i>Down</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>next to</i> ROSALIE, L.C.). I'm trying to remember. It's queer
what a jumbled memory one has. If anyone had asked me about it I would
have said I could have told how we were sitting with great accuracy. But
I can't somehow.
</p>
<p>
MISS ERSKINE. I was next to you, Mr. Crosby. (<i>Upper</i> L. <i>side of
circle. She turns to</i> MRS. CROSBY, <i>who is standing over</i> L.) Don't you
remember, Mrs. Crosby, he said he'd always wanted to hold my hand, and
we joked about it. (<i>Sits in her original chair</i>.)
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (L., <i>outside of circle</i>). Yes. I remember.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. That's all right, then. Who came next?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Down</i> R. <i>They all hesitate</i>.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>eagerly</i>). Inspector, I can place them all for you.
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>over end of table</i> R.). But you said you didn't care how we sat.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(HELEN R.C. <i>in circle</i>.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. So I did, sir, but I knew where you were sitting all the same.
You will permit that I show you, Inspector?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>after a pause</i>). If you will be so kind.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MISS STANDISH <i>sits in circle</i>.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. The young lady was 'ere. And this gentleman 'e was 'ere.
(<i>Indicating</i> TRENT'S <i>chair</i>.)
</p>
<p>
TRENT (<i>from</i> L., <i>outside of circle</i>). By George, I couldn't have told
you, but she's right. This is exactly where I was sitting. (<i>Sits in
circle</i>.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>taking</i> HELEN <i>hastily by the shoulder and putting her in the
next seat</i>). And this young lady was 'ere. (HELEN <i>looks at her for a
moment and then sinks back in her chair</i>. ROSALIE <i>points at</i> MASON.) He
did come next.
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>over</i> R.). No, you're wrong there&mdash;I&mdash;You're right&mdash;I remember
perfectly I was next to Miss O'Neill. (<i>Crosses</i> L. <i>and sits</i> L. <i>side
of circle</i>.) I know just how her hand felt in the dark.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(WILLIAM <i>looks at him quickly</i>. HELEN <i>turns and looks at him in
wonder</i>.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>seated</i> L. <i>side in circle</i>). Well really, Mr. Mason!
</p>
<p>
MASON. Oh, I don't mean it that way at all. I assure you I don't.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Then why did you say it? (<i>Seated</i> R.C.)
</p>
<p>
MASON. My dear fellow, I've apologized. You are misunderstanding me.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. I think we're all very much upset. (L. <i>outside circle.</i>)
Inspector Donohue, must we go through all this again?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I'm afraid so, Mrs. Crosby.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Then let's get it over as quickly as possible. (<i>Sits</i> C. <i>in
his original chair in circle.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Mr. Crosby, you seem to forget that this is a police
investigation, and must be conducted as I see fit. Who sat next to Mr.
Mason?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>pointing to</i> MISS EASTWOOD). This young lady.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. I was next to Mr. Mason, wasn't I, Philip?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Crossing inside of circle, to chair lower</i> L. <i>side of circle, and
sits.</i>)
</p>
<p>
MASON. Yes.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Now then, who occupied this seat?
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT (L.C. <i>outside of circle</i>). Mr. Wales. I know because I sat
<i>there</i>, and I was <i>next</i> to him. Shall I sit there now?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. If you will be so good.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MRS. TRENT <i>crosses to</i> R. <i>and sits in circle.</i>)
</p>
<p>
STANDISH (<i>upper end of table</i> R.). I was next to Mrs. Trent. (<i>He sits.</i>)
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. And I was here between Mr. Standish and Billy.
</p>
<p>
(<i>She sits.</i> DONOHUE <i>moves off a step down</i> R. <i>and stands
looking at them as they sit.</i> ROSALIE <i>moves over and takes her
place in armchair.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. You are all sure that's where you were sitting?
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. There's some mix up here, I know. (ROSALIE <i>rises</i>.)
I wasn't next to Mr. Wales.
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>rises</i>). Of course you weren't. I don't see what I could have
been thinking of. <i>I</i> sat where Miss Eastwood is.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. Yes, and I was next to Mr. Trent, between Philip and Mr.
Trent. I felt sure I was in the wrong seat. (<i>Rises.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>quite casually</i>). Then perhaps you ladies will exchange
places.
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(ROSALIE <i>gives a little sigh of relief when she sees that</i> DONOHUE
<i>attaches no importance to the substitution she has made, and sits down
again.</i> HELEN <i>and</i> Miss EASTWOOD, <i>change seats.</i> HELEN <i>crosses
outside of circle.</i>)
</p>
<p>
Now we're all right, aren't we? (<i>Slight buzz of conversation.</i>) You are
quite sure that you are all in the places you occupied during the
sance?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Yes. I think so.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>puts his hand on the empty chair</i>). We'll pretend that
Mr. Wales is still sitting here. (<i>Slight movement from all.</i>) Now,
Mr. Crosby, I'll ask you to tell me what happened after the sance began.
But first I'll ask you this question, was there any special arrangement
about the seats?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>hurriedly rising</i>). There was not, sir. I told them that they
could sit anywhere they did wish. Young Mr. Crosby must 'ave sat by the
light on purpose. And I am so sorry I did make the mistake about the
young ladies. I do not know 'ow I came to make a mistake like that.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Oh, well, if they couldn't remember where they sat, I don't
see how I can expect you to be entirely accurate. (ROSALIE <i>sits in
arm-chair up</i> C.) However, we're all right now. Now, Mr. Crosby.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Well, after Madame la Grange had shown how she broke out of&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. We'll start with the sance. (<i>All look at</i> DONOHUE.) I know
how mediums break the circle and all that. And you needn't describe how
she went into that trance of hers.
</p>
<p>
MASON. Inspector, I don't think you're fair to this woman. I think
there's something pretty important that you haven't been told.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>All look at</i> MASON.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Then you'd better tell me now.
</p>
<p>
MASON. In order that there should be no deception, we had Madame la
Grange searched.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I see.
</p>
<p>
MASON. And while she was out of the room&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Oh, she left the room?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>All look at</i> DONOHUE.)
</p>
<p>
MASON. Yes, and all of the ladies went with her. Then someone suggested
that we ask Madame la Grange about some special thing, and Mr. Wales
said he was going to ask her to get in communication with Spencer Lee
and see if we couldn't find out who killed him&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. Most ridiculous thing&mdash;
</p>
<p>
MASON. As soon as she went into her trance, or whatever it was, Spencer
Lee's spirit tried to talk to us.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. She began to give you messages from Spencer Lee without knowing
that this was what you were trying to get?
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>in triumph</i>). Exactly. And there's no use in trying to tell
me that there's nothing in spiritualism, because now I know better.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Thank you very much, Mr. Mason. What you've told me is
extremely important. I'm anxious to know what was said, because I'm a
good deal interested in the Spencer Lee case myself.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MRS. TRENT <i>turns and faces door, still sitting in her chair</i>.)
</p>
<p>
MASON. Then you think there's something in this spiritualism. I never
did until to-day, but, by Jove, you know you can't explain this any
other way.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Madame la Grange went into a trance. We'll grant that much,
anyway. What happened then?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. After a few minutes she began talking to us in the voice of a
little child.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. That was Laughing Eyes, my spirit control.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Just what did Laughing Eyes say?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. It was all mixed up; none of it very clear. But she seemed to be
trying to talk <i>for</i> someone <i>to</i> someone. She kept calling for Ned.
Then suddenly she spoke deeply, in a man's voice.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Did the man's message have any importance? I mean, did it seem
to make sense?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. It was perfectly coherent at any rate. I can't give you the
exact words, but&mdash;
</p>
<p>
MASON (<i>interrupting</i>). I can. He said, "Ned&mdash;I want Ned. Why in <i>Hell</i>
don't Ned answer me?"
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>standing at lower end of table</i> B.). And did anyone answer?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Eventually Wales replied.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I want you all to be extremely careful in what you tell me. I
don't want any surmises. In the first place, did the message come for
anyone but Mr. Wales?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. There was at no time mention of Wales' name. The calls were
always for "Ned."
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I see. Did anyone else answer the calls?
</p>
<p>
STANDISH. <i>I</i> asked two or three questions, but no attention was paid to
them.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. What did Mr. Wales say to all this?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I don't think Mr. Wales spoke at all until the message about
saving his life came.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. And after that?
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. There was a regular conversation between them.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Then there was some mention about some letters. I remember, too,
that Mr. Wales said, "Are you trying to tell me who killed you?"
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. What was the reply to that?
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY. All we got were the words, "Ask&mdash;ask&mdash;ask."
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. And then I said, "Do you know who killed you?"
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Did you get an answer?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Not directly. The message was another cry for "Ned."
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. What happened then?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Then Mr. Wales said, "Do you know who killed you?"
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>eagerly</i>). What answer did he get?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. None. The medium began to moan and cry. Then Mr. Wales asked her
again and again for the name. He kept crying, "Tell me who killed you; I
want the name." He must have asked her two or three times. Then he cried
out that he was hurt.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. And then?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. That's all.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Enter</i> DUNN <i>from door</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
DUNN. The matron is here now, sir.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Just a minute. Just one more question, Mr. Crosby. Did you get
the impression that if Mr. Wales had not been killed his question would
have been answered?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. If you grant that the sance was real, it would be impossible to
arrive at any other conclusion.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. It was well established in your mind that Wales was the only
person able to get a message?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Yes.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. It follows then that he was killed in order to prevent his
question being answered.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. That's the impression I got.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. This leads to the conclusion that whoever killed Wales knew who
had killed Spencer Lee.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I should think so.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>front of table</i> R.). And it is not difficult to surmise
that the person who killed Wales was actuated by the strongest of all
motives&mdash;self-protection. So in all human probability the murderer
of Wales was also the murderer of Spencer Lee. You see, ladies and
gentlemen, that by the use of a little patience we have come a long way
in our investigation. (<i>There is a long pause.</i>) I don't wish to put
you all through the humiliation of a search. I should like to end this
inquiry here and now. (<i>Moves a step</i> R. <i>There is another pause</i>.) No?
Then we'll have to go on. (<i>Moves briskly to below table</i> R.) There is a
police matron in the other room who will search the ladies of the party.
Sergeant Dunn will perform a similar duty with the men. Mike, you will
take them one at a time. It makes no difference to me in what order
they go.
</p>
<p>
MASON. Well, I've got nothing to conceal. (<i>He rises and places chair
up</i> L., <i>then moves to door</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Neither 'ave I. (<i>She rises and moves down</i> C.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I'd rather you waited for a few minutes, Madame la Grange.
(ROSALIE <i>looks at him sharply</i>.) Any of the other ladies will do.
</p>
<p>
MRS. CROSBY (<i>rising</i>). Suppose I set the others a good example.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Thank you very much. (MRS. CROSBY <i>comes down</i> C., <i>then
crosses to door</i> L. DONOHUE <i>looks at the others, where they are still
seated</i>.) And thank you all for the great help you've given me. You need
not sit there any longer, unless you wish.

<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>crossing to</i> DONOHUE R.). Inspector, I think you're
perfectly wonderful.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Oh, we haven't done very much yet, Miss Eastwood. Give the
police a little time. (<i>He turns and crosses to</i> L.C. <i>With an abrupt
change of tone</i>.) Madame la Grange, there's a question I wish to ask
you.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>coming down to</i> L.C.). Anything at all, sir.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (L.C.). When Mr. Wales asked you for the name, why didn't you
answer him?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I do not know. I was in a trance. (<i>She moves down</i> L.).
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Then you didn't hear the question.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. How could I?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I didn't ask you that. I want to know why you didn't answer
him.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I 'ave already told you, I was in a trance. I did not know what
was going on.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Why didn't you tell the name that you had agreed with Wales you
would tell?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (L.C., <i>astonished</i>). Agreed?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. You heard what I said. (<i>There is a pause.</i>) Well, why didn't
you carry out your part of the bargain? (CROSBY <i>moves to front of
chesterfield</i> C.) Why didn't you give him the name as you'd planned?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I do not know what you do mean.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. My words are perfectly plain. I asked you why you didn't carry
out your part of the bargain?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. There was not any bargain?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Your whole sance was a fake. (<i>Slight movement from others.</i>)
It was not only planned but rehearsed between you and Wales. He thought
that a woman had killed his friend. He told you about it, and asked your
help to discover the murderer,
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I do not know what you talk about.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>ignoring her reply</i>). Every detail of this sance was planned.
When he asked you the name you were to tell him the name of a woman&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MRS. TRENT <i>moves up</i> R. <i>and joins</i> TRENT <i>and</i> MISS ERSKINE <i>at
table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Inspector, I 'ave never 'eard one word of this before,
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Not a word?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Not a word.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (L.C., <i>taking paper out of the inside pocket of his coat</i>,
<i>and reading aloud</i>). "What do you want? Answer. Don't forget the
swimming pool. Don't ever forget the swimming pool. Do you mean the
time he went in after me? When we were little boys. Spencer Lee says he
can't rest." And so on and so on, down to. "Do you know who killed you?"
(<i>He turns to the others.</i>) The answer to that should have been "Yes."
What did she say?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>now in front of table</i> R.). She didn't answer that question.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>looks at paper again</i> L.C.). The next question is, "Can you
tell the name?" And then she was to have told that woman's name. Just
the first name. Mrs. Crosby, what did she reply to that question?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. She moaned and cried.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. What did she say after that?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Nothing. She moaned again and came out of the so-called trance.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Why didn't you do as you agreed?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>down</i> L.C., <i>left side of</i> DONOHUE. <i>Stonily</i>).
I do not know what you talk about.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. The police know that some woman killed Spencer Lee. Something
was taken from the inside pocket of his coat. We think it was a package
of letters. This woman left traces. We have her finger-prints&mdash;many of
them. Eventually we'll find her. For three or four weeks Mr. Wales has
been working among the people who knew Lee. His theory was that this
woman wanted to get back her letters&mdash;in fact, did get them back. He
felt reasonably sure that he had found the woman&mdash;that one of you ladies
here to-night is probably the woman we are hunting. He thought that he
could play on her superstitious fears, and that when her name seemingly
came from the spirit of the dead man she would confess. He told Madame
la Grange the name, explained to her just what he wanted, and together
he and I worked out the exact wording of the messages that were supposed
to come from Spencer Lee's spirit. (<i>He turns suddenly to</i> ROSALIE,
<i>who is down</i> L.C.) You agreed to all this; why didn't you speak
the name?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I do not know anything about it. He&mdash;he must 'ave forgotten to
tell it to me.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Oh, no, he didn't.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(MISS EASTWOOD <i>down in front of table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>with great decision</i>). There was no name. He did not tell
to me any name.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. My good woman, you mustn't take me for a fool. You agreed to
use a certain name; you came here for that purpose, and then after you
got here, something happened to make you change your plans. Something
unexpected happened. (<i>He stops for a moment; turns to</i> MISS EASTWOOD.)
Miss Eastwood, what did you say was your first name?
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD. Mary.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>to</i> MISS ERSKINE). And yours?
</p>
<p>
MISS ERSKINE (<i>back of table</i> R.). Elizabeth.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Yours?
</p>
<p>
MISS STANDISH. Grace.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Mr. Crosby, your wife's name is?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Alicia.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Mrs. Trent?
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT (R.C.). Helen.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE, Miss O'Neill?
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>up</i> C., <i>in front of chesterfield</i>). Helen.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>There is a long pause</i>.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (L.C. WILLIAM <i>comes to</i> HELEN C.). Helen, I see. So there are
two Helens. Two Helens. (<i>He stands looking first at one and then at the
other of the two women.</i>) Mr. Crosby, when Madame la Grange first came
to-night, did she show any surprise at seeing any of the people here?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (R.C.). Not that I noticed.
</p>
<p>
MISS EASTWOOD (<i>below table</i> R.). Oh, yes, she did. Miss O'Neill wasn't
in the room when she arrived. Later when she came in Madame la Grange
seemed upset; she said something to her that none of us could hear. Then
I remember she argued with Mr. Wales and said she didn't feel like
having a sance.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Now we're getting it.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(WILLIAM <i>stands</i> R. <i>of</i> HELEN O'NEILL <i>up</i> C.)
</p>
<p>
Everything was going along smoothly, until Miss O'Neill came in. The
extra Helen. (<i>He turns to</i> CROSBY.) Mr. Crosby, your daughter was in
the room when Madame la Grange came in?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Yes.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. You noticed nothing unusual in this woman's manner?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I'd never seen her before.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I mean, she did nothing to attract your attention; the fact
that Helen Trent was in the room made no impression on her?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Seemingly not.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Then Helen O'Neill came in. (<i>Goes up to</i> HELEN C., <i>then
crosses down to</i> ROSALIE L. <i>Sharply to her</i>.) Rosalie la Grange, what's
that girl to you?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Nothing at all.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (C.). Nothing at all! Then why did you try to deceive me as to
where she sat. Why did you place her so that I would not know she was
sitting next to Mr. Wales when he was stabbed?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. It was just my mistake. I did not do it on purpose.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I'm afraid that won't do. It's perfectly apparent that the name
you were to speak was&mdash;Helen, What's the use of lying to me! You've
tried your best to shield this girl. I want to know why.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. There's no reason. I never saw the young lady before in all my
life.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. What's that girl to you?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Nothing, nothing at all&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>starts to</i> ROSALIE). <i>Damn you</i>, you old harridan, you come
across&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>springing forward from up</i> R.C. <i>down to</i> L.C. <i>and pushing</i>
DONOHUE <i>up stage</i>). Let my mother alone, let my mother alone.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>She goes to</i> ROSALIE, <i>puts her arms around her. Pause.</i> ROSALIE
<i>weeps</i>.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>very quietly</i>). I thought perhaps I'd get it that way.
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>getting</i> L. <i>side of</i> ROSALIE). There, there, dear, it's all
right, it's all right.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>with a grim smile, coming down</i> C.). Of course it's all right!
We've got the finger-prints and&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>interrupting him&mdash;coming down to</i> C.). If you think for one
minute I'm going to let you&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. My boy, wait! (<i>grabbing him and pinning down his arms to his
sides</i> C.). Think what&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Think nothing. (<i>He shakes himself free and goes to</i> DONOHUE
L.C.) That's the girl I love, and I'll be <i>damned</i> if I let you take her
finger-prints.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Young man, don't be a fool. I'm sorry, but it's too clear.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>breaking away from her daughter and moving to</i> DONOHUE
C.). Clear&mdash;how is it too clear? Inspector, you are never going to
accuse my little girl of a thing like that?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (C.). She was next to him; she had only to free one hand and
strike, and then take his hand again!
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. There was something else she had to do before she could ever do
that. She had to have murder in her heart.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Well?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>turns suddenly; seizes her daughter by the hand, turns her to
him.</i> ROSALIE <i>stays between</i> DONOHUE <i>and</i> HELEN). Look at 'er. Look in
'er eyes&mdash;look at the face of 'er. Is there murder there? 'Ave you not
eyes in your 'ead.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DUNN <i>enters from</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
DUNN. It's not on either of them.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I know where it is. Tell the matron she'll find the knife on
this girl.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>to</i> DONOHUE C.). Inspector, I will tell to you anything I
know, only keep your hands off my little girl. I did come 'ere like you
say, and when I see my little girl I lose my 'ead. I tried to save 'er
and I 'ave made it worse. You 'ave looked at 'er, the poor young thing
that would not 'arm a fly, and you think she could do a thing like that.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Yes.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>still crying bitterly</i>). Then, Inspector Donohue, you are
a damn fool, and with God's 'elp I will prove it.

(<i>Turns and goes up stage and then to the window at</i> R. <i>She pulls up

<p>
ROSALIE (<i>at window</i> R.). I did, sir.
</p>

</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I was praying. (<i>Coming to above table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Praying? What for?

<p>
ROSALIE. Guidance.

<p>
DUNN. Yes, Inspector.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Did Madame la Grange see you as she came in here?
</p>
<p>
DUNN (<i>down</i> L.). No, sir. I followed your instructions and kept out of
sight.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (L.C.). How long has she been here?
</p>
<p>
DUNN. About ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Time enough for her to find what we couldn't.
</p>
<p>
DUNN. I'll bet she's got it.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Take her to Mrs. MacPherson. She's not to go near anyone or
speak to anyone. Tell Mrs. Mac to search her. (<i>He turns to</i> ROSALIE,
<i>who is</i> C.) Unless, of course, you want to give up that knife now.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I 'ave not any knife, and I 'ave been searched once.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (L.C.). Exactly, and then you were allowed to come back into
this room. We're rather anxious to see what you've found while you were
in here. Well?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I 'ave found nothing that would be any good to you.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I'm the best judge of that. What was it you found?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I found comfort, sir. A feeling that the innocent would come to
no 'arm.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>dryly</i>). Take her to Mrs. MacPherson. Come back as soon
as you turn her over to the matron.

</p>
<p>
DUNN. I sent him to see if they'd hidden that knife up there?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Good. (<i>To</i> POLICEMAN.) Find anything?
</p>
<p>
POLICEMAN. Nothing but dirt. Who pays for this uniform?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. You don't, anyway. Could you hear anything while you were up
there?
</p>
<p>
POLICEMAN. Not a thing.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. You are sure?
</p>

POLICEMAN. Certain.

<p>
DUNN (<i>down</i> L. <i>After a pause</i>). Don't it beat <i>Hell</i>?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Why?
</p>
<p>
DUNN. That knife couldn't have flew away.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>coming</i> C.). We'll find it eventually. It's in this room
somewhere.
</p>
<p>
DUNN. No, sir, it ain't.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Where have you looked?
</p>
<p>
DUNN. Everywhere.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Not hidden in the furniture?
</p>
<p>
DUNN. I'll gamble it ain't. Took up all the rugs, shook 'em. Dug through
the upholstery in the furniture, looked back of mat on the wall. It's
not in the bric--brac, or whatever these swells call their jugs.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DONOHUE <i>crosses towards table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Unless we find it on the old woman, it's still in this room.
</p>
<p>
DUNN. I suppose you noticed that she opened the window.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>upper end of table</i> R.). Yes, I noticed that. Mike, you've the

<p>
DONOHUE. Say, Doolan! See anything?
</p>
<p>
DOOLAN (<i>outside window</i> R.). A woman put up the window just now. She
stood there a while looking up in the air. (<i>Pause.</i>) Watching the
stars, I guess.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Have anything in her hand?
</p>
<p>
DOOLAN. No, sir. The light from this lamp was shinin' right on her. I
could see everything.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Throw anything out of the window?
</p>
<p>
DOOLAN. No, Inspector.

DOOLAN. I gotcha.

like it I can take everyone down to Police Headquarters. You know what
will happen&mdash;what the newspapers will do if I take all these ladies and
gentlemen down town. In the end this way will be the best for you and
your friends. Well, how about it?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (L.C.). Thank you. I think you'd better regard this house as your
own for the present.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (C.). All right. If you don't mind I'll use this room as a
headquarters for the present.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I have already told you to use this house as your own.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Thank you. Good evening.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>with a laugh</i>). I'm dismissed?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. You're dismissed. (CROSBY <i>walks toward door</i> L.) Why did Wales
object to the engagement of your son and Helen O'Neill?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>turns to</i> DONOHUE). Who told you that? (<i>Moving a few steps.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. It doesn't matter. I know that he did. Why?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>turning front</i>). I can't talk about it.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (C.). All right. You're the best judge of that. Only I'm
attaching a great deal of importance to this fact. If I'm unduly
emphasizing its value, don't you think you'd better set me straight
about it?
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. What possible bearing can it have on&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Motive, my dear sir, motive.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Come now. You can't think that this girl killed Wales because
she heard him ask us to wait before we sanctioned her engagement to my
son.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. She did hear Mr. Wales make that objection. That's just what I
wanted to know.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (L.). I think I'd better send for my lawyer.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (C.). Well, you can do as you like about that. Frankly, I don't
understand your attitude at all. I can appreciate your desire to spare
your son all the unhappiness that you can. But if this young woman
killed Wales and Lee, the sooner we find it out the better for you and
your family.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Oddly enough I was thinking only of Miss O'Neill at the moment.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. You'd better think of yourself and your family first.
(<i>Moves</i> R. <i>a few steps</i>.)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. That's for me to decide. I certainly am not going to allow that
child to be bullied and badgered in the usual police fashion. (<i>Moves</i>
R. <i>a step</i>.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. You're going to do as you are told, sir. If you warn that girl,
if you caution her in any way, I'll drag every one of you down town. You
and your wife and your son and the girl and all your friends. Be
reasonable, Mr. Crosby. If the girl is innocent, telling me the truth
won't hurt her. If she's guilty, and I think she is, by God, I'm going
to drag the truth out of her and her mother. (<i>There is a knock on the
door down</i> L.) Come in.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(HELEN <i>enters</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN (L.). You wanted me?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Yes, come in. Sit down, please.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Indicating chair below table</i> R. HELEN <i>crosses and sits</i>. CROSBY
<i>starts to move</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Helen&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. What you are planning to do, Mr. Crosby, will only make matters
worse, I promised you that.
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(<i>After a moment's pause</i> CROSBY <i>exits</i> L. <i>and leaves door open</i>.
DONOHUE <i>turns, closes door and turns sharply to</i> HELEN. <i>Crosses
towards the table</i>.)
</p>
<p>
Now then, young woman, let's hear what you've got to say.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Nothing.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (C.). Nothing? I don't suppose it's necessary for me to tell you
that you're under grave suspicion.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. No, I realize that.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Now, the best way to help yourself if you're innocent is to be
quite frank with me. (<i>She simply looks at him, but does not speak.</i>)
Well?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. I've already told you that there is nothing that I can say.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Someone has advised you not to answer me. Who was it? (<i>There
is a pause.</i>) You'd better tell me. (<i>Moves</i> R.C.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN. I am not going to answer any of your questions.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I told you that if you were innocent, nothing that you could
say would hurt you. If you're guilty&mdash;well that's a different matter.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. You know that I didn't do it.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>in front of table</i> R.). Well, there you are. Why not
answer my question then? The sooner we find out who is guilty the sooner
you'll be freed from suspicion. You see that, don't you?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Yes.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>brings chair and sits in front of table</i> R.). Now we're
getting along. How well did you know Spencer Lee? (HELEN <i>does not
answer him&mdash;looking front</i>.) You'd better make up your mind to talk.
Do you hear? (HELEN <i>does not speak. Losing his temper.</i>) Why, you
little fool, do you think you can fight me? (<i>He turns sharply to face
her, turning his back on the door at</i> L.) You were the last person to
see Spencer Lee alive. Yes, and you saw him dead, too. You heard Wales
threaten to tell these fine people what he knew about you; you knew he'd
prevent your marriage to this young millionaire, and then&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(ROSALIE <i>enters quietly from</i> L. <i>and stands for a moment watching
them</i>.)
</p>
<p>
When your chance came in the dark you killed him. Now then, you come
across with the truth.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. She'll come across with nothing. (<i>Crosses</i> R. <i>to table</i>.)
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DONOHUE <i>rises and stands by table</i> R.C. HELEN <i>rises</i>.)
</p>
<p>
You said that she was the one that did it and you would find the knife
on 'er. Well, you did not, did you? You think that she is the person
that killed Spencer Lee?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Yes.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Well, she is not. You say you 'ave the finger-prints of the
girl who was in his rooms. Well, take 'er finger-prints and put them
side by side with the others, and then you will see. I dare you to do
that.
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>with a cry</i>). Mother&mdash;&mdash; (<i>She stops suddenly.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. What were you going to say?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Nothing.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DUNN <i>enters with box and envelope</i>.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. That's very wise of you.
</p>
<p>
DUNN. Got it, Inspector. (<i>Crosses to</i> C.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>down</i> R.). Do they compare?
</p>
<p>
DUNN. To a T.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(ROSALIE C., HELEN <i>down</i> R. DONOHUE <i>in front table between</i> HELEN
<i>and</i> ROSALIE.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. All right. Let me have 'em. Now ask Mr. Crosby and his son to
come here at once.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DUNN <i>turns and exits</i> L. DONOHUE <i>up</i> C. <i>crosses to back of table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
I already have your daughter's finger-prints, Madame la Grange.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. 'Ave you really? ... You are very smart.
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(HELEN <i>crosses to</i> ROSALIE R.C. ROSALIE <i>puts her arms about the girl
and swings her</i> L. <i>of her. When</i> DONOHUE <i>opens box at the back of
table</i> CROSBY <i>and</i> WILLIAM <i>enter from</i> L. <i>accompanied by</i> DUNN.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. That's all, Mike.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DUNN <i>exits</i> L. <i>and closes door</i>. CROSBY L. <i>of</i> HELEN. WILLIAM L.
<i>of</i> CROSBY.)
</p>
<p>
Mr. Crosby, I told you that I'd settle this case in a few minutes. The
end has come sooner than I thought. I am now ready to make an arrest.
I have sent for you and your son because&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He suddenly turns toward</i>
HELEN.) This is the woman we have been hunting.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. That is a lie! (R. <i>end of chesterfield</i>.)
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(WILLIAM <i>goes to</i> HELEN.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>picking up cup and holding it out toward them</i>). Here is the
cup&mdash;
</p>
<div class="stagec">
(CROSBY <i>crosses down</i> R. <i>to below table&mdash;moves chair over</i> R.)
</div>
<p><br />
which we took from Spencer Lee's rooms. These are the finger-prints of
the woman who used it. (<i>Ignoring</i> CROSBY <i>for the moment</i>.) Here is the
saucer that she used. More finger-prints. A few minutes ago I sent this
young woman a note. The man who gave it to her wore gloves, so did I
when I addressed the envelope. Hers are the only naked hands that have
touched it. (<i>He picks up the envelope gingerly by one corner, and
holds it outward to them.</i>) They are unquestionably Helen O'Neill's
finger-prints. (HELEN <i>is in</i> WILLIAM'S <i>arms</i>. DONOHUE <i>puts down the
envelope. Then he picks up the cup and points to the finger-marks on
it</i>.) And so, Mr. Crosby, are these. There can be no doubt about it.
There is never any doubt about this method of identification. In twenty
years there has never been one mistake. We now have what we've been
hunting for: the woman who went to Spencer Lee's rooms.
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(DONOHUE <i>steps back with a little gesture of triumph</i>. CROSBY <i>stands
staring at the girl</i>. ROSALIE <i>comes to</i> R. <i>of</i> HELEN, <i>turns to her</i>.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (C.). Look at me, my darling. Look at your mother. (<i>She takes</i>
HELEN'S <i>face in her hands and looks at her closely. Then with a little
cry of contentment stands</i> R. <i>of</i> HELEN. ROSALIE <i>and</i> HELEN <i>back up
to chesterfield</i>.) Now, darling, you must not be frightened. Look up,
child. Why do not you say something?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. I can't.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Sits on chesterfield.</i> DONOHUE <i>gives a short laugh</i>.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. What can she say?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>going to her</i>). Dear, tell him it's a lie.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Wait. Let me talk to her. (CROSBY <i>comes over to</i> HELEN <i>and
sits beside her on the chesterfield</i>, R. <i>side</i>. WILLIAM <i>is at</i> L.
<i>end</i>.) My dear, you understand that none of us believe&mdash;what the
Inspector wants us to believe. We know that you have never done
anything&mdash;that you are no more guilty of this atrocious crime than I am.
We all want to help you. We believe in you and trust you and love you.
You understand that, don't you?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Yes.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. I won't have this.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. I'm afraid you must, Will. (<i>He turns again to</i> HELEN.) We
want to help you, so, my dear, you must be perfectly frank with us.
Inspector Donohue says he can prove that you went to that man's rooms.
Is that true?
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>slowly and reluctantly</i>). Yes.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(DONOHUE <i>gives a short laugh. Sits back of table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (R. <i>of chesterfield</i>). And what if she did? She had a good
errand. What did you go for, darling?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. I can't tell you.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Dear, you must tell us. (<i>She looks at him suddenly. He comes
over and kneels beside her and talks to her as if to a little child.</i>)
My dear, it isn't that we don't trust you. Surely you know how we all
love you? But we must know the truth&mdash;because we have to show <i>him</i> how
wrong he is.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>seated back of table</i> R.). Yes, and I'm waiting to be shown.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>kneeling</i> L. <i>of</i> HELEN). Why did you go to Spencer Lee?
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>sitting on chesterfield</i>). You mustn't ask me that. I can't tell
you.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>still on chesterfield</i>). But if you don't tell us, how can we
help you?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. I didn't do anything, I didn't do anything.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. We know that, my child. But why did you go? (HELEN <i>does not
answer</i>.) Did you know Spencer Lee?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Of course she didn't.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>seated back of table</i> R.). Why don't she speak for herself?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Because I'll speak for her.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Can't you answer even that question?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(HELEN <i>shakes her head and makes a despairing gesture</i>.)
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. But, dear, don't you see what they'll think? Helen, you must
tell me.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Could I speak to mother, alone? (<i>She rises.</i>)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. You cannot.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(CROSBY <i>and</i> WILLIAM <i>rise</i>. CROSBY <i>moves to</i> L. <i>end of
chesterfield.</i>)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (R. <i>end of chesterfield</i>). Where is the 'arm in that? A child
'as the right to talk to 'er own mother any time she does want.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Anything you wish to say you can say in front of me.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>coming to</i> HELEN C.). Darling, you need not mind the nice
Inspector. I well know that there was never anything in your mind that
you could not say before all the world. (<i>There is a pause.</i>) Tell your
mother, my darling.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(CROSBY <i>is now</i> C. WILLIAM <i>stands below him</i> C.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>beginning to cry</i>). I can't. I can't.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (C.). Stop, there 'as been crying enough. I did lose my 'ead
through that. Stop crying or I will beat you. (<i>She too begins to cry
and takes her daughter in her arms again.</i>) There, there, my dear. Your
mother is not going to let anyone 'urt you&mdash;not anyone at all. (<i>They
cry together for a moment, and then</i> ROSALIE <i>gets her self-control
back. She blows her nose vigorously</i>.) We will both be the better for
that. Now then, tell me.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Mother, I can't.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (R.C.). Who did you promise you would not?
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>surprised</i>). Why, how did you&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. She is shielding someone.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. No. No.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. That is the first lie you 'ave ever told me. I want to know who
it is you are shielding? (HELEN <i>does not answer</i>. ROSALIE <i>suddenly
turns to</i> WILLIAM.) She is your girl?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (L.C.). Yes.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Then make her tell.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>to</i> HELEN C.). Nell dear, you must&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Billy, I can't.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>drops down</i> L. <i>of group</i>). My dear, even if you're protecting
someone else, I think you ought to tell us.
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>with a sudden outburst</i>). Why are you all against me? Why are
you all trying to make me break my&mdash;
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>Moves to</i> R. <i>end of chesterfield</i>. WILLIAM <i>comes to her</i>. CROSBY
<i>is</i> L.C.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>interrupting</i> HELEN, <i>coming to</i> R.C.). Break your word? You
shall not. You need not tell. I know it myself now&mdash;I 'ave been blind.
(<i>She turns suddenly on the</i> INSPECTOR&mdash;<i>moves to down table</i> R., <i>above
him</i>.) You are the one that found out there was two Helens. The extra
Helen, you said. Well, please to send for the other Helen and ask her.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Mother, stop!
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Stop? I will not.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (C.). Wait, please. Is it my daughter you're protecting? (HELEN
<i>does not answer</i>.) Because if it is&mdash;-much as we love her&mdash;my dear, we
can't accept that sacrifice from you. I'm her father, and you must tell
me the truth. Did my daughter send you? (<i>There is a long pause.</i>) Did
you go for my daughter?
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>slowly</i>). Yes.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I did know it. (<i>Above table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. My daughter sent you. What for?
</p>
<p>
HELEN (R.C.). Some letters.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>in front of chesterfield</i> C.). Why didn't she go herself?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. She was afraid.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>still seated back of table</i> R.). Well, go on.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(HELEN <i>does not speak</i>.)
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (R.C.). Tell him, dear, it's all right.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. I don't know what to say.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Why not tell the truth? (<i>Rises and comes to chair below
table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Tell the Inspector what happened, dearie. (<i>Putting</i> HELEN
<i>in chair front of table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Nothing happened. That's the funny part of it. The minute Mr. Lee
understood that I knew about the letters, everything was changed. I said
that unless he gave them to me I'd tell Mr. Crosby about them. He seemed
terribly upset. He said he hadn't meant to frighten Helen. That he loved
her, and was desperate. I thought it was a funny kind of love, but I
didn't tell him that. Then he gave me the letters.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Was this before or after you had tea with him?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Before.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Go on. He gave you the letters?
</p>
<p>
HELEN (<i>seated in front of table</i> R.). Yes. And he seemed terribly
unhappy. He begged me to stay and talk to him for a few minutes, and I
did. He asked me to have some tea with him, and I did that too.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. How charming! What did you do after tea?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(ROSALIE <i>is at the back of the chair in the front of the table</i>.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN. I came home and gave Helen her letters.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. And that's all?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. That's all.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Why did you do this?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. She's Billy's sister.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. My compliments, young woman. That was beautifully done. And she
looks so innocent too.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (C). You don't believe&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Not a word of it. Not one word.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. And why not?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. That I <i>don't</i> is sufficient. Her story is preposterous. Your
daughter's&mdash;
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. It is the truth.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Do you expect me to believe for a minute that a man like Lee
would threaten your daughter, and then when a total stranger comes to
him and asks for the letters, give them up without a word? Why, no jury
in the world would believe your story.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Jury? You're not going to arrest her?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. She is arrested.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. You 'ave not proof.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>below table</i> R.). All the proof that I need. If she was
innocent, why didn't she tell me all this when I first questioned her?
Why did she wait until she knew that I had proof&mdash;that she had been in
Spencer Lee's rooms?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. She was protecting my sister.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Women don't hang together like that.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>upper end of table</i> R.). Oh, they do, they do! The poor
creatures!
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>down</i> R.). They do not. I know them. (<i>He turns to</i> WILLIAM.)
She wasn't protecting your sister. She was protecting herself. She went
for the letters, of course; and they had tea before she asked for them,
not afterwards.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (R.C. <i>to</i> L. <i>of</i> WILLIAM). How do you know that?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. She couldn't take tea with a man she's just killed.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Why, <i>damn</i> you&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Starts</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>grabbing</i> WILLIAM <i>by shoulders</i>). Billy!
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>breaks up stage a few steps, then down stage again</i>). I'm
sorry. I didn't mean to lose my temper. I suppose we've got to take this
thing calmly. Inspector, you honestly believe that Nelly killed this
man?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Yes.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Why should she?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. She was engaged to you&mdash;he had compromising letters she had
written to him&mdash;he was threatening her with exposure&mdash;she went to get
her letters. They had tea together&mdash;she's admitted that, after we proved
it, and then when he wouldn't give up her letters she killed him. So
much for the first murder. (<i>Turns away.</i>) Now for the second: she was
sitting next to Wales; he had already threatened her with exposure; in
another minute the medium would have told her name as that of the person
who had been at Spencer Lee's rooms. She pulled her hand away from his,
struck and took his hand again. (<i>There is a pause.</i>) Young man, you'll
have a hard time tearing apart that chain of evidence.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Except for the fact that she did never write the man a letter
in 'er life, it is a grand case you 'ave, Inspector.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>down</i> C. <i>a step</i>. CROSBY <i>goes above</i> WILLIAM C.). Of course.
Dad, we've lost our brains. She didn't go for her own letters. (WILLIAM
<i>turns to the</i> INSPECTOR.) You were talking of juries. Do you think any
jury will believe that a young girl would kill a man to get back another
woman's letters for her? (<i>He starts toward door</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Where are you going?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. To get my sister.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Wait. (WILLIAM <i>stops</i>.) I'll send for Mrs. Trent.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>crosses</i> L.C.). But I want to ask her&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>interrupting him</i>). I'll ask my own questions. If you want to
help this investigation, you might call Sergeant Dunn for me.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(WILLIAM <i>opens door at</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Sergeant Dunn, the Inspector wants you. (<i>He turns back to the
girl, and</i> DUNN <i>enters</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Ask Mrs. Trent to come here.
</p>
<p class="exposition">
(DUNN <i>exits at</i> L. ROSALIE <i>is at the</i> R. <i>end of chesterfield</i>. HELEN

</p>
<p>
I sent for Mrs. Trent.
</p>
<p>
TRENT (L.C.). I know that. What do you want to see her about?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Mrs. Trent, did you ask this girl to go to Spencer Lee's rooms
to get letters you had written to him?
</p>
<p>
TRENT (L. <i>of</i> MRS. TRENT). Did she what?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Did you, Mrs. Trent?
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT (L.C.). Certainly not.
</p>
<p>
HELEN. Why&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Rises from chair in front of table</i> R.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>sternly</i>). Keep still, you. (<i>To</i> MRS. TRENT.) Are you sure?
</p>
<p>
TRENT (<i>L.</i> of MRS. TRENT). Of course she's sure.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Mr. Trent, you must stop these interruptions. (<i>To</i> MRS.
TRENT.) Will you please answer my question?
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT. I never wrote a letter to Spencer Lee in my life. (<i>She
suddenly turns to</i> HELEN.) How dare you say I sent you there?
</p>
<p>
HELEN. You did! You did! (<i>In front of table.</i>)
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT (<i>down</i> L.C.). I don't know what she's told you, Inspector,
but&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Never mind what she told me. I want to be very sure of this.
You did not ask this girl to go to Spencer Lee's rooms?
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT. No.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>down</i> R.). He had no letters of yours?
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT (L.C.). No.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Do you know whether this girl had written to him?
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT. I don't know anything about it.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>coming</i> L. <i>of</i> MRS. TRENT. CROSBY <i>comes</i> C.). But Nell
didn't know Lee, and you did, Helen.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>still down</i> R.). How about that, Mrs. Trent?
</p>
<p>
MRS. TRENT. I hadn't seen Mr. Lee for two or three years. He used to
come here a good deal. He wanted to marry me, but I didn't like him. And
I certainly never wrote him letters of any sort. That is all I can tell
you.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Thank you very much. That is all that I want to know.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>turning on his sister</i>). You're lying to save yourself. You've
got to tell the truth.
</p>
<p>
TRENT. She is telling you the truth.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. She's not.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY (<i>after a pause, putting his hand on his son's shoulder</i>).
I'm sorry, Billy.

<p class="stagec">
(WILLIAM <i>goes up to chesterfield</i> C. <i>and sits</i>. CROSBY <i>looks coldly

MRS. TRENT. Father, you know that&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Yes, dear, I know. Inspector, do you want us any more?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Not any more, thank you.
</p>
<p>
CROSBY. Come then, children. (<i>He exits with</i> MR. <i>and</i> MRS. TRENT

ROSALIE (C.). I would not if I was you. Inspector, I do know who 'as

</p>
<p class="stagec">
(WILLIAM <i>rises</i>.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (<i>turning to</i> ROSALIE C.). You know! Who was it?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. I cannot tell you yet. (DONOHUE <i>laughs</i>. WILLIAM <i>goes to</i>
HELEN.) But I will! I will!
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. Telling's not enough. There's just one thing that will convince
me that she didn't kill Spencer Lee.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>down</i> E.). What, Inspector, what?
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. The confession of the one who did. (<i>He turns to</i> ROSALIE.)
Bring me that and I'll set your daughter free.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (C.). Inspector, give me a chance. Do not arrest my little girl.
Give me time. I do know who 'as done it and I will get for you what you
want.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE (L.C.). Nonsense!
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (<i>moves up to</i> INSPECTOR). Give me one hour, sir. Keep them all
here one hour more.
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. No.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (<i>in front of table</i> R.). Give her a chance. We are all here&mdash;no
one will get away. What difference will a few minutes make?
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(<i>There is a pause</i>. DONOHUE <i>takes out his watch and looks at it</i>.)
</p>
<p>
DONOHUE. I'll give her ten minutes. Mike, tell Doolan again to arrest
anyone trying to leave the house, and get on the front door yourself and
stay there until I tell you. (DUNN <i>turns and exits at</i> L.) You've got
just ten minutes.
</p>

</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (L.C.). Why didn't you <i>tell</i> who did it?

<p>
ROSALIE (C.). How could I? I 'ave no idea in the world. But I am going
to find out. I am going to find out.
</p>
<p>
HELEN (B.C.). But how, mother, how?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Call them back. Make them all come, too. I want them all.
(HELEN <i>runs off</i> L.) Sir, run down into the 'all. Do you know which is
Mr. Wales' overcoat?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. Yes, I think so.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. See if you can find for me a glove or something of 'is&mdash;and
'urry, <i>mon Dieu</i>, 'urry!

<p class="exposition">

</p>
<p>
Did you get it?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM (L.C.). What are you going to do?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (L.C.). Trick them. Lie to them. It is for Nelly. Do you blame me?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. What can I do to help?
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. You are a man after my own 'eart. I am going to do something
to put the fear of God into the 'eart of that murderer. Do not pay any
attention to me. Watch <i>them</i>. Do not look at me, do not take your
eyes off them. I am looking for one of them to do something that will
show us the way. It is our only chance.
</p>
<p class="stagec">
(HELEN <i>runs in</i> L.)
</p>
<p>
HELEN. They're coming.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. Leave the door open so we can 'ear them. (HELEN <i>does so and
returns to her mother, standing</i> L. <i>of</i> ROSALIE.) Child, kiss me for
luck. (<i>They kiss.</i>) It will do no 'arm to kiss him, too. (<i>They kiss.</i>)
Now, my boy, can you lie?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. <i>Can I!</i>
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE (C.). I am going into a trance. When they do come into the room
you will tell them that I asked for Mr. Wales' glove and the minute I
'ave it in my hand I went off like they see me. Tell them you thought
there might be some reason for it. And then leave the rest to me. (<i>She
sits in the chair</i> C., <i>facing the back of the stage</i>.)
</p>
<p>
WILLIAM. I understand.
</p>
<p>
ROSALIE. You stand here at the back of me. I wish for them all to be
in front of me. (WILLIAM <i>crosses back of</i> ROSALIE <i>to</i> R. <i>side of</i>

stand close by me. (<i>To</i> WILLIAM.) Go farther back. (HELEN <i>moves to</i> R.

the realest trance and the grandest fake. When I come out, make them go
away, tell them you are afraid and that it will kill me to see anyone.

WILLIAM (R. <i>side of</i> ROSALIE'S <i>chair</i>). I don't know, exactly. We were

I only wish I could have done it over and over again. That's all.

too.

I stood in the doorway of his room and told him I'd come to kill him,
and he ran for his revolver and as he ran I threw the knife into his
back. Then I picked up my knife and walked away. No one saw me. I was
quite safe. Quite safe until she came. And unseen hands pushed me
forward. Unseen hands have pointed the way. She's not human. Lee's
message came through her&mdash;you all heard Wales speak; out of her lips we
heard Wales' voice. He said he'd come back, again and again and again.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
