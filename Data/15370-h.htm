<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Twas on the shores that round our coast<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From Deal to Ramsgate span,<br /></span>
<span>That I found alone, on a piece of stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An elderly naval man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>His hair was weedy, his beard was long,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And weedy and long was he,<br /></span>
<span>And I heard this wight on the shore recite,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In a singular minor key:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the mate of the <i>Nancy</i> brig,<br /></span>
<span>And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the crew of the captain's gig.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>
<span>And he shook his fists and he tore his hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till I really felt afraid;<br /></span>
<span>For I couldn't help thinking the man had been drinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And so I simply said:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Oh, elderly man it's little I know<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of the duties of men of the sea,<br /></span>
<span>And I'll eat my hand if I understand<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How you can possibly be<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;At once a cook, and a captain bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the mate of the <i>Nancy</i> brig,<br /></span>
<span>And a bo'sun tight and a midshipmite,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the crew of the captain's gig.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Then he gave a hitch to his trousers, which<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is a trick all seamen larn,<br /></span>
<span>And having got rid of a thumping quid,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He spun this painful yarn:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;'Twas in the good ship <i>Nancy Bell</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1">That we sailed to the Indian sea,<br /></span>
<span>And there on a reef we come to grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which has often occurred to me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>
<span>&quot;And pretty nigh all o' the crew was drowned<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(There was seventy-seven o' soul),<br /></span>
<span>And only ten of the <i>Nancy's</i> men<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Said 'Here!' to the muster roll.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;There was me and the cook and the captain bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the mate of the <i>Nancy</i> brig,<br /></span>
<span>And the bo'sun tight and a midshipmite,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the crew of the captain's gig.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;For a month we'd neither wittles nor drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till a-hungry we did feel,<br /></span>
<span>So, we drawed a lot, and, accordin' shot<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The captain for our meal.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The next lot fell to the <i>Nancy's</i> mate,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And a delicate dish he made;<br /></span>
<span>Then our appetite with the midshipmite<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We seven survivors stayed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And then we murdered the bo'sun tight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And he much resembled pig;<br /></span>
<span>Then we wittled free, did the cook and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the crew of the captain's gig.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>
<span>&quot;Then only the cook and me was left,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the delicate question, 'Which<br /></span>
<span>Of us two goes to the kettle?' arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And we argued it out as sich.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;For I loved that cook as a brother, I did,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the cook he worshipped me;<br /></span>
<span>But we'd both be blowed if we'd either be stowed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the other chap's hold, you see.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;'I'll be eat if you dines off me,' says Tom,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Yes, that,' says I, 'you'll be,'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'I'm boiled if I die, my friend,' quoth I,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And 'Exactly so,' quoth he.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Says he, 'Dear James, to murder me<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Were a foolish thing to do,<br /></span>
<span>For don't you see that you can't cook <i>me</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While I can&mdash;and will&mdash;cook <i>you</i>!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;So, he boils the water, and takes the salt<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the pepper in portions true<br /></span>
<span>(Which he never forgot), and some chopped shalot,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And some sage and parsley too.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>
<span>&quot;'Come here,' says he, with a proper pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which his smiling features tell,<br /></span>
<span>''T will soothing be if I let you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How extremely nice you'll smell,'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And he stirred it round and round and round,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And he sniffed the foaming froth;<br /></span>
<span>When I ups with his heels, and smothers his squeals<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the scum of the boiling broth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And I eat that cook in a week or less,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And&mdash;as I eating be<br /></span>
<span>The last of his chops, why I almost drops,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For a wessel in sight I see.</span></div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' /><br />
<div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And I never larf, and I never smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I never lark nor play,<br /></span>
<span>But I sit and croak, and a single joke<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I have&mdash;which is to say:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the mate of the <i>Nancy</i> brig,<br /></span>
<span>And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Of all the ships upon the blue,<br /></span>
<span>No ship contained a better crew<br /></span>
<span>Than that of worthy Captain Reece.<br /></span>
<span>Commanding of <i>The Mantelpiece</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>He was adored by all his men,<br /></span>
<span>For worthy Captain Reece, R.N.,<br /></span>
<span>Did all that lay within him to<br /></span>
<span>Promote the comfort of his crew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>If ever they were dull or sad,<br /></span>
<span>Their captain danced to them like mad,<br /></span>
<span>Or told, to make the time pass by,<br /></span>
<span>Droll legends of his infancy.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>A feather bed had every man,<br /></span>
<span>Warm slippers and hot-water can,<br /></span>
<span>Brown windsor from the captain's store,<br /></span>
<span>A valet, too, to every four.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Did they with thirst in summer burn?<br /></span>
<span>Lo, seltzogenes at every turn.<br /></span>
<span>And on all very sultry days<br /></span>
<span>Cream ices handed round on trays.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>
<span>Then currant wine and ginger pops<br /></span>
<span>Stood handily on all the &quot;tops:&quot;<br /></span>
<span>And, also, with amusement rife,<br /></span>
<span>A &quot;Zoetrope, or Wheel of Life.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>New volumes came across the sea<br /></span>
<span>From Mister Mudie's libraree;<br /></span>
<span><i>The Times</i> and <i>Saturday Review</i><br /></span>
<span>Beguiled the leisure of the crew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Kind-hearted Captain Reece, R.N.,<br /></span>
<span>Was quite devoted to his men;<br /></span>
<span>In point of fact, good Captain Reece<br /></span>
<span>Beatified <i>The Mantelpiece</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>One summer eve, at half-past ten,<br /></span>
<span>He said (addressing all his men):<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Come, tell me, please, what I can do<br /></span>
<span>To please and gratify my crew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;By any reasonable plan<br /></span>
<span>I'll make you happy if I can;<br /></span>
<span>My own convenience count as <i>nil</i>;<br /></span>
<span>It is my duty, and I will.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Then up and answered William Lee,<br /></span>
<span>(The kindly captain's coxswain he,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">His time of life was thirty-two.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>He lived among a working clan<br /></span>

<span class="i1">No saint, however&mdash;not at all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>He smoked, but in a modest way,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Because he thought he needed it;<br /></span>
<span>He drank a pot of beer a day,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>At times he'd pass with other men<br /></span>

<span class="i1">A decent English working man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>One day, when at the Nelson's Head,<br /></span>

<span>He laid his hand on Robert's beer<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Before he could drink up any,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">He poured the pot of &quot;thruppenny.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Oh, Robert, at this very bar,<br /></span>

<span>&quot;Come, Polter,&quot; said the fiend, &quot;begin,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>It was a robber's daughter, and her name was Alice Brown;<br /></span>
<span>Her father was the terror of a small Italian town;<br /></span>
<span>Her mother was a foolish, weak, but amiable old thing;<br /></span>
<span>But it isn't of her parents that I'm going for to sing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>
<span>As Alice was a-sitting at her window-sill one day,<br /></span>
<span>A beautiful young gentleman he chanced to pass that way;<br /></span>
<span>She cast her eyes upon him, and he looked so good and true,<br /></span>
<span>That she thought, &quot;I could be happy with a gentleman like you!&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And every morning passed her house that cream of gentlemen,<br /></span>
<span>She knew she might expect him at a quarter unto ten,<br /></span>
<span>A sorter in the Custom-house, it was his daily road<br /></span>
<span>(The Custom-house was fifteen minutes' walk from her abode).<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>But Alice was a pious girl, who knew it wasn't wise<br /></span>
<span>To look at strange young sorters with expressive purple eyes;<br /></span>
<span>So she sought the village priest, to whom her family confessed,<br /></span>
<span>The priest by whom their little sins were carefully assessed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>
<span>&quot;Oh, holy father,&quot; Alice said, &quot;'twould grieve you, would it not?<br /></span>
<span>To discover that I was a most disreputable lot!<br /></span>
<span>Of all unhappy sinners I'm the most unhappy one!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>The padre said, &quot;Whatever have you been and gone and done?&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I have helped mamma to steal a little kiddy from its dad,<br /></span>
<span>I've assisted dear papa in cutting up a little lad,<br /></span>
<span>I've planned a little burglary and forged a little check,<br /></span>
<span>And slain a little baby for the coral on its neck!&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The worthy pastor heaved a sigh and dropped a silent tear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And said, &quot;You mustn't judge yourself too heavily, my dear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>It's wrong to murder babies, little corals for to fleece:<br /></span>
<span>But sins like that one expiates at half-a-crown apiece.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>
<span>&quot;Girls will be girls&mdash;you're very young, and flighty in your mind;<br /></span>
<span>Old heads upon young shoulders we must not expect to find;<br /></span>
<span>We mustn't be too hard upon these little girlish tricks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Let's see&mdash;five crimes at half-a-crown&mdash;exactly twelve-and-six.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Oh, father,&quot; little Alice cried, &quot;your kindness makes me weep,<br /></span>
<span>You do these little things for me so singularly cheap&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Your thoughtful liberality I never can forget;<br /></span>
<span>But, O, there is another crime I haven't mentioned yet!&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;A pleasant-looking gentleman, with pretty purple eyes,<br /></span>
<span>I've noticed at my window, as I've sat a-catching flies:<br /></span>
<span>He passes by it every day as certain as can be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I blush to say I've winked at him and he has winked at me!&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>
<span>&quot;For shame,&quot; said Father Paul, &quot;my erring daughter! On my word<br /></span>
<span>This is the most distressing news that I have ever heard.<br /></span>
<span>Why, naughty girl, your excellent papa has pledged your hand<br /></span>
<span>To a promising young robber, the lieutenant of his band!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;This dreadful piece of news will pain your worthy parents so!<br /></span>
<span>They are the most remunerative customers I know;<br /></span>
<span>For many years they've kept starvation from my doors,<br /></span>
<span>I never knew so criminal a family as yours!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The common country folk in this insipid neighborhood<br /></span>
<span>Have nothing to confess, they're so ridiculously good;<br /></span>
<span>And if you marry any one respectable at all,<br /></span>
<span>Why, you'll reform, and what will then become of Father Paul?&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>
<span>The worthy priest, he up and drew his cowl upon his crown,<br /></span>
<span>And started off in haste to tell the news to Robber Brown;<br /></span>
<span>To tell him how his daughter, who now was for marriage fit,<br /></span>
<span>Had winked upon a sorter, who reciprocated it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Good Robber Brown he muffled up his anger pretty well,<br /></span>
<span>He said &quot;I have a notion, and that notion I will tell;<br /></span>
<span>I will nab this gay young sorter, terrify him into fits,<br /></span>
<span>And get my gentle wife to chop him into little bits.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I've studied human nature, and I know a thing or two,<br /></span>
<span>Though a girl may fondly love a living gent, as many do&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A feeling of disgust upon her senses there will fall<br /></span>
<span>When she looks upon his body chopped particularly small.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>
<span>He traced that gallant sorter to a still suburban square;<br /></span>
<span>He watched his opportunity and seized him unaware;<br /></span>
<span>He took a life-preserver and he hit him on the head,<br /></span>
<span>And Mrs. Brown dissected him before she went to bed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And pretty little Alice grew more settled in her mind,<br /></span>
<span>She never more was guilty of a weakness of the kind,<br /></span>
<span>Until at length good Robber Brown bestowed her pretty hand<br /></span>
<span>On the promising young robber, the lieutenant of his band.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>I once did know a Turkish man<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whom I upon a two-pair-back met,<br /></span>
<span>His name it was Effendi Khan<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Backsheesh Pasha Ben Allah Achmet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>A Doctor Brown I also knew&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I've often eaten of his bounty&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The Turk and he they lived at Hooe,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In Sussex, that delightful county.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>I knew a nice young lady there,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her name was Isabella Sherson,<br /></span>
<span>And though she wore another's hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She was an interesting person.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The Turk adored the maid of Hooe<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(Although his harem would have shocked her);<br /></span>
<span>But Brown adored that maiden, too:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He was a most seductive doctor.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>
<span>They'd follow her where'er she'd go&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A course of action most improper;<br /></span>
<span>She neither knew by sight, and so<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For neither of them cared a copper.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Brown did not know that Turkish male,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He might have been his sainted mother:<br /></span>
<span>The people in this simple tale<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are total strangers to each other.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>One day that Turk he sickened sore<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which threw him straight into a sharp pet;<br /></span>
<span>He threw himself upon the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And rolled about upon his&mdash;carpet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>It made him moan&mdash;it made him groan<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And almost wore him to a mummy:<br /></span>
<span>Why should I hesitate to own<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That pain was in his little tummy?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>At length a Doctor came and rung<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(As Allah Achmet had desired)<br /></span>
<span>Who felt his pulse, looked up his tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And hummed and hawed, and then inquired:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>
<span>&quot;Where is the pain, that long has preyed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upon you in so sad a way, sir?&quot;<br /></span>
<span>The Turk he giggled, blushed, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&quot;I don't exactly like to say, sir.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Come, nonsense!&quot; said good Doctor Brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&quot;So this is Turkish coyness, is it?<br /></span>
<span>You must contrive to fight it down&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Come, come, sir, please to be explicit.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The Turk he shyly bit his thumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And coyly blushed like one half-witted,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;The pain is in my little tum,&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He, whispering, at length admitted.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Then take you this, and take you that&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Your blood flows sluggish in its channel&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>You must get rid of all this fat,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And wear my medicated flannel.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;You'll send for me, when you're in need&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My name is Brown&mdash;your life I've saved it!&quot;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And drew a mighty sword and waved it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>
<span>&quot;This to thy weazand, Christian pest!&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Aloud the Turk in frenzy yelled it,<br /></span>
<span>And drove right through the Doctor's chest<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The sabre and the hand that held it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The blow was a decisive one,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Doctor Brown grew deadly pasty&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Now see the mischief that you've done,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You Turks are so extremely hasty.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;There are two Doctor Browns in Hooe,<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He's</i> short and stout&mdash;<i>I'm</i> tall and wizen;<br /></span>
<span>You've been and run the wrong one through,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That's how the error has arisen.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The accident was thus explained,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Apologies were only heard now:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;At my mistake I'm really pained,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I am, indeed, upon my word now.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;With me, sir, you shall be interred,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A Mausoleum grand awaits me&quot;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Oh, pray don't say another word,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'm sure that more than compensates me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>
<span>&quot;But, p'r'aps, kind Turk, you're full inside?&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&quot;There's room,&quot; said he, &quot;for any number.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>And so they laid them down and died.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In proud Stamboul they sleep their slumber.<br /></span>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
