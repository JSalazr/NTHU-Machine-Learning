    <h2>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>

    <p>These studies have been published in various journals at
    different times. They are reprinted together because there is
    some demand for them, and they are not easily accessible. In
    preparing them for publication in the present form, some of
    them have been expanded and all of them have been revised.</p>

    <p>While each study is complete in itself, the general thesis
    running through all of them is the same&mdash;that the
    differences in bodily habit between men and women, particularly
    the greater strength, restlessness, and motor aptitude of man,
    and the more stationary condition of woman, have had an
    important influence on social forms and activities, and on the
    character and mind of the two sexes.</p>

    <h2>ORGANIC DIFFERENCES IN THE SEXES</h2>

    <p>A grand difference between plant and animal life lies in the
    fact that the plant is concerned chiefly with storing energy,
    and the animal with consuming it. The plant by a very slow
    process converts lifeless into living matter, expending little
    energy and living at a profit. The animal is unable to change
    lifeless into living matter, but has developed organs of
    locomotion, ingestion, and digestion which enable it to prey
    upon the plant world and upon other animal forms; and in
    contrast with plant life it lives at a loss of energy.
    Expressed in biological formula, the habit of the plant is
    predominantly anabolic, that of the animal predominantly
    katabolic.</p>

    <p>Certain biologists, limiting their attention in the main to
    the lower forms of life, have maintained very plausibly that
    males are more katabolic than females, and that maleness is the
    product of influences tending to produce a katabolic habit of
    body.<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       If this assumption is correct, maleness and femaleness are
       merely a repetition of the contrast existing between the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
       id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span> animal and the plant. The
       katabolic animal form, through its rapid destruction of
       energy, has been carried developmentally away from the
       anabolic plant form; and of the two sexes the male has been
       carried farther than the female from the plant process. The
       body of morphological, physiological, ethnological, and
       demographic data which follows becomes coherent, indeed,
       only on the assumption that woman stands nearer to the plant
       process than man, representing the constructive as opposed
       to the disruptive metabolic tendency.<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

    <p>The researches of Düsing,<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
       supplementing the antecedent observations of
       Ploss,<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
       and further supplemented by the ethnological data collected
       by Westermarck,<a id="footnotetag5"
       name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>
       seem to demonstrate a connection between an abundance of
       nutrition <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
       id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> and females, and between
       scarcity and males, in relatively higher animal forms and in
       man. The main facts in support of the theory that such a
       connection exists are the following: Furriers testify that
       rich regions yield more furs from females and poor regions
       more from males. In high altitudes, where nutrition is
       scant, the birthrate of boys is high as compared with lower
       altitudes in the same locality. Ploss has pointed out, for
       instance, that in Saxony from 1847 to 1849 the yield of rye
       fell, and the birth-rate of boys rose with the approach of
       high altitudes. More boys are born in the country than in
       cities, because city diet is richer, especially in meat;
       Düsing shows that in Prussia the numerical excess of boys is
       greatest in the country districts, less in the villages,
       still less in the cities, and least in
       Berlin.<a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>
       In times of war, famine, and migration more boys are born,
       and more are born also in poor than in well-to-do families.
       European statistics show that when food-stuffs are high or
       scarce the number of marriages diminishes, and in
       consequence a diminished number of births follows, and a
       heightened percentage of boys; with the recurrence of
       prosperity and an increased number of marriages and births,
       the percentage <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
       id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> of female births rises (though
       it never equals numerically that of the
       males).<a id="footnotetag7"
       name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>
       More children are born from warm-weather than from
       cold-weather conceptions,<a id="footnotetag8"
       name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>
       but relatively more boys are born from cold-weather
       conceptions. Professor Axel Key has shown from statistics of
       18,000 Swedish school children that from the end of November
       and the beginning of December until the end of March or the
       middle of April, growth in children is feeble. From
       July-August to November-December their daily increase in
       weight is three times as great as during the winter
       months.<a id="footnotetag9"
       name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>
       This is evidence in confirmation of a connection between
       maleness, slow growth, and either poor nutrition or cold
       weather, or both. Professor Key's
       investigations<a id="footnotetag10"
       name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>
       have also confirmed the well-known fact that maturity is
       reached earlier in girls than in boys and have shown that in
       respect of growth the ill-nourished girls follow the law of
       growth of the boys. Growth is a function of nutrition,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"
       id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> and puberty is a sign that
       somatic growth is so far finished that the organism produces
       a surplus of nutrition to be used in reproduction.
       Organically reproduction is also a function of nutrition,
       and, as Spencer pointed out, is to be regarded as
       discontinuous growth. The fact than an anabolic surplus,
       preparatory to the katabolic process of reproduction, is
       stored at an earlier period in the female than in the male,
       and that this period is retarded in the ill-nourished
       female, is a confirmation of the view that femaleness is an
       expression of the tendency to store nutriment, and explains
       also the infantile somatic characters of woman. Finally, the
       fact that polyandry is found almost exclusively in poor
       countries, coupled with the fact that ethnologists uniformly
       report a scarcity of women in those countries, permits us to
       attribute polyandry to a scarcity of women and scarcity of
       women to poor food conditions.</p>

    <p>This evidence should be considered in connection with the
    experiments of Yung on tadpoles, of Siebold on wasps, and of
    Klebs on the modification of male and female organs in
    plants:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>According to Yung, tadpoles pass through an
        hermaphroditic stage, in common, according to other
        authorities, with most animals.... When the tadpoles were
        left <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"
           id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span> to themselves, the females
           were rather in the majority. In three lots the
           proportion of females to males was: 54-46, 61-39, 56-44.
           The average number of females was thus about fifty-seven
           in the hundred. In the first brood, by feeding one set
           with beef, Yung raised the percentage of females from 54
           to 78: in the second, with fish, the percentage rose
           from 61 to 81; while in the third set, when the
           especially nutritious flesh of frogs was supplied, the
           percentage rose from 56 to 92. That is to say, in the
           last case the result of high feeding was that there were
           92 females and 8 males.<a id="footnotetag11"
           name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

        <p>Similarly, the experiments of Siebold on wasps show that
        the percentage of females increases from spring to August,
        and then diminishes. We may conclude without scruple that
        the production of females from fertilized ova increases
        with the temperature and food supply, and decreases as
        these diminish.<a id="footnotetag12"
           name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

        <p>Nor are there many facts more significant than the
        simple and well-known one that within the first eight days
        of larval life the addition of food will determine the
        striking and functional differences between worker and
        queen.<a id="footnotetag13"
           name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

        <p>It is certainly no mere chance, but agrees with other
        well-known facts, that for the generation of the female
        organ more favorable external circumstances must prevail,
        while the male organ may develop under very much more
        unfavorable conditions.<a id="footnotetag14"
           name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"
       id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>

    <p>These facts are not conclusive, but they all point in the
    same direction, and are probably sufficient to establish a
    connection between food conditions and the determination of
    sex. But behind the mere fact that a different attitude toward
    food determines difference of sex lies the more
    fundamental&mdash;indeed, the real&mdash;explanation of the
    fact, and this chemists and physiologists are not at present
    able to give us. Researches must be carried farther on the
    effect of temperature, light, and water on variation, before we
    may hope to reach a positive conclusion. We can only assume
    that the chemical constitution of the organism at a given
    moment conditions the sex of the offspring, and is itself
    conditioned by various factors&mdash;light, heat, water,
    electricity, etc.&mdash;and that food is one of these
    variables.<a id="footnotetag15"
       name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>
       It is sufficient for our present
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> purpose that sex is a
       constitutional matter, indirectly dependent upon food
       conditions; that the female is the result of a surplus of
       nutrition; and that the relation reported among the lower
       forms persists in the human species.</p>

    <p>In close connection with the foregoing we have the fact,
    reported by Maupas,<a id="footnotetag16"
       name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>
       that certain Infusorians are capable of reproducing
       asexually for a number of generations, but that, unless the
       individuals are sexually fertilized by crossing with
       unrelated forms of the same species, they finally exhibit
       all the signs of senile degeneration, ending in
       death.<a id="footnotetag17"
       name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>
       After sexual conjugation there was an access of vitality,
       and the asexual reproduction proceeded as before. "The
       evident result of these long and fatiguing experiments
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> is that among the ciliates
       the life of the species is decomposed into evolutional
       cycles, each one having for its point of departure an
       individual regenerated and rejuvenated by sexual
       copulation."<a id="footnotetag18"
       name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

    <p>The results obtained by Maupas receive striking
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span> confirmation in the universal
       experience of stock-breeders, that, in order to keep a breed
       in health, it is necessary to cross it occasionally with a
       distinct but allied variety. It appears, then, that a
       mixture of blood has a favorable effect on the metabolism of
       the organism, comparable to that of abundant nutrition, and
       that innutrition and in-and-in breeding are alike
       prejudicial.</p>

    <p>If this is true, and if heightened nutrition yields an
    increased proportion of females, we ought to find that
    breeding-out is favorable to the production of females, and
    breeding-in to the production of males; and a considerable body
    of evidence in favor of this assumption
    exists.<a id="footnotetag19"
       name="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

    <p>Observations of above 4,000 cases show that, among horses,
    the more the parent animals differ in color, the more the
    female foals outnumber the male. Similarly, in-and-in-bred
    cattle give an excessively large number of bull calves.
    Liaisons produce an abnormally large proportion of
    females;<a id="footnotetag20"
       name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>
       incestuous unions, of males.<a id="footnotetag21"
       name="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>
       Among the Jews, who frequently marry
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span> cousins, the percentage of
       male births is very high.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>According to Mr. Jacobs' comprehensive manuscript
        collection of Jewish statistics ... the average proportion
        of male and female Jewish births registered in various
        countries is 114.5 males to 100 females, whilst the average

    <p>Viewed with reference to activity, the animal is an advance
    on the plant, from which it departs by morphological and
    physiological variations suited to a more energized form of
    life; and the female may be regarded as the animal norm from
    which the male departs by further morphological variations. It
    is now well known that variations are more frequent and marked
    in males than in females. Among the lower forms, in which
    activity is more directly determined mechanically by the
    stimuli of heat, light, and chemical attraction,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span> and where in general the food
       and light are evenly distributed through the medium in which
       life exists, and where the limits of variation are
       consequently small, the constitutional nutritive tendency of
       the female manifests itself in size. Among many Cephalopoda
       and Cirripedia, and among certain of the Articulata, the
       female is larger than the male. Female spiders, bees, wasps,
       hornets, and butterflies are larger than the males, and the
       difference is noticeable even in the larval stage. So
       considerable is the difference in size between the male and
       female cocoons of the silk-moth that in France they are
       separated by a particular mode of
       weighing.<a id="footnotetag24"
       name="footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a>
       The same superiority of the female is found among fishes and
       reptiles; and this relation, wherever it occurs, may be
       associated with a habit of life in which food conditions are
       simple and stimuli mandatory. As we rise in the scale toward
       backboned and warm-blooded animals, the males become larger
       in size; and this reversal of relation, like the development
       of offensive and defensive weapons, is due to the superior
       variational tendency of the male, resulting in characters
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span> which persist in the species
       wherever they prove of life-saving

    <p>The superior activity and variability of the male among
    lower forms has been pointed out in great detail by Darwin and
    confirmed by others.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Throughout the animal kingdom, when the sexes differ in
        external appearance, it is, with rare exceptions, the male
        which has been more modified; for, generally, the female
        retains a closer resemblance to the young of her own
        species, and to other adult members of the same group. The
        cause of this seems to lie in the males of almost all
        animals having stronger passions than the
        females.<a id="footnotetag26"
           name="footnotetag26"></a><a href="#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Darwin explains the greater variability of the
    males&mdash;as shown in more brilliant colors, ornamental
    feathers, scent-pouches, the power of music, spurs, larger
    canines and claws, horns, antlers, tusks, dewlaps, manes,
    crests, beards, etc.&mdash;as due to the operation of sexual
    selection, meaning by this "the advantage which certain
    individuals have over others of the same sex and species solely
    in respect of reproduction,"<a id="footnotetag27"
       name="footnotetag27"></a><a href="#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a>
       the female choosing to pair with the more attractive male,
       or the stronger male prevailing in a contest
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"

       Wallace<a id="footnotetag28"
       name="footnotetag28"></a><a href="#footnote28"><sup>28</sup></a>
       advanced the opposite view, that the female owes her
       soberness to the fact that only inconspicuous females have
       in the struggle for existence escaped destruction during the
       breeding season. There are fatal objections to both these
       theories; and, taking his cue from
       Tylor,<a id="footnotetag29"
       name="footnotetag29"></a><a href="#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a>
       Wallace himself, in a later work, suggested what is probably
       the true explanation, namely, that the superior variability
       of the male is constitutional, and due to general laws of
       growth and development. "If ornament," he says, "is the
       natural product and direct outcome of superabundant health
       and vigor, then no other mode of selection is needed to
       account for the presence of such
       ornament."<a id="footnotetag30"

       That a tendency <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span> to spend energy more rapidly
       should result in more striking morphological variation is to
       be expected; or, put otherwise, the fact of a greater
       variational tendency in the male is the outcome of a
       constitutional inclination to destructive metabolism. It is
       a general law in the courtship of the sexes that the male
       seeks the female. The secondary sexual characters of the
       male are developed with puberty, and in some cases these
       sexual distinctions come and go with the breeding season.
       What we know as physiological energy is the result of the
       dissociation of atoms in the organism; expressions of energy
       are the accompaniment of the katabolic or breaking-up
       process, and the brighter color of the male, especially at
       the breeding season, results from the fact that the waste
       products of the katabolism are deposited as pigments.</p>

    <p>When we compare the sexes of mankind morphologically, we
    find a greater tendency to variation in
    man:<a id="footnotetag31"
       name="footnotetag31"></a><a href="#footnote31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

    <p>All the secondary sexual characters of man are highly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span> variable, even within the
       limits of the same race; and they differ much in the several
       races.... Numerous measurements carefully made of the
       stature, the circumference of the neck and chest, the length
       of the backbone and of the arms, in various races ... nearly
       all show that the males differ much more from one another
       than do the females. This fact indicates that, as far as
       these characters are concerned, it is the male which has
       been chiefly modified, since the several races diverged from
       their common stock.<a id="footnotetag32"
       name="footnotetag32"></a><a href="#footnote32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

    <p>Morphologically the development of man is more accentuated
    than that of woman. Anthropologists, indeed, regard woman as
    intermediate in development between the child and the man.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The outlines of the adult female cranium are
        intermediate between those of the child and the adult man;
        they are softer, more graceful and delicate, and the
        apophyses and ridges for the attachment of muscles are less
        pronounced,... the forehead is ... more perpendicular, to
        such a degree that in a group of skulls those of the two
        sexes have been mistaken for different types; the
        superciliary ridges and the glabella are less developed,
        often not at all; the crown is higher and more horizontal;
        the brain weight and cranial capacity are less; the mastoid
        apophyses, the inion, the styloid apophyses, and the
        condyles of the occipital are of less volume, the zygomatic
        and alveolar arches are more regular.<a id="footnotetag33"

    </blockquote>

    <p>Wagner decided that the brain of a woman,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> taken as a whole, is
       uniformly in a more or less embryonic condition. Huschke
       says that woman is always a growing child, and that her
       brain departs from the infantile type no more than the other
       portions of her body.<a id="footnotetag34"
       name="footnotetag34"></a><a href="#footnote34"><sup>34</sup></a>
       Weisbach<a id="footnotetag35"
       name="footnotetag35"></a><a href="#footnote35"><sup>35</sup></a>
       pointed out that the limits of variation in the skull of man
       are greater than in that of woman.</p>

    <p>Several observers have recorded the opinion that women of
    dolichocephalic races are more brachycephalic, and women of
    brachycephalic races more dolichocephalic, than the men of the
    same races. If this is true, it is a remarkable confirmation of
    the conservative tendency of woman. "I have thought for several
    years that woman was, in a general way, less dolichocephalic in
    dolichocephalic races, and less brachycephalic in
    brachycephalic races, and that she had a tendency to approach
    the typical median form of humanity."<a id="footnotetag36"
       name="footnotetag36"></a><a href="#footnote36"><sup>36</sup></a>
       The skin of woman is without exception of a lighter shade
       than that of man, even among the dark races. This cannot be
       due to less exposure, since the women and men are equally
       exposed among the uncivilized races, but
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> is due to the same causes as
       the more brilliant plumage of male birds.</p>

    <p>The form of woman is rounder and less variable than that of
    man, and art has been able to produce a more nearly ideal
    figure of woman than of man; at the same time, the bones of
    woman weigh less with reference to body weight than the bones
    of man, and both these facts indicate less variation and more
    constitutional passivity in woman. The trunk of woman is
    slightly longer than that of man,<a id="footnotetag37"
       name="footnotetag37"></a><a href="#footnote37"><sup>37</sup></a>
       and her abdomen is relatively more prominent, and is so
       represented in art. In these respects she resembles the
       child and the lower races, i.e., the less developed
       forms.<a id="footnotetag38"
       name="footnotetag38"></a><a href="#footnote38"><sup>38</sup></a>
       Ranke states that the typical adult male form is
       characterized by a relatively shorter trunk, relatively
       longer arms, legs, hands, and feet, and relatively to the
       long upper arms and thighs by still longer forearms and
       lower legs, and relatively to the whole upper extremity by a
       still longer lower extremity; while the typical female form
       approaches the infantile condition in having a relatively
       longer trunk, shorter arms, legs, hands, and feet;
       relatively to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> short upper arms still
       shorter forearms, and relatively to short thighs still
       shorter lower legs, and relatively to the whole short upper
       extremity<a id="footnotetag39"

       a still shorter lower extremity&mdash;a very striking

    <p>Miss Thompson, whose results were obtained in a
    psychological laboratory, concludes that in reactions where
    strength is involved men are clearly superior to women, and
    this is the only respect in which she finds a marked
    difference:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Motor ability in most of its forms is better in men than
        in women. In strength, rapidity of movement, and rate of
        fatigue they have a very decided advantage. These three
        forms of superiority are probably all expressions of one
        and the same fact&mdash;the greater muscular strength of
        men. Men are very slightly superior to women in precision
        of movement. This fact is probably also connected with
        their superior muscular force. In the formation of a new
        co-ordination women are superior. The superiority of men in
        muscular strength is so well known that it is a universally
        accepted fact. There has been more or less dispute as to
        which sex displayed greater manual dexterity. According to
        the present results, that depends on what is meant by
        manual dexterity. If it means the ability to make very
        delicate and minutely controlled movements, then it is
        slightly better in men. If it means ability to co-ordinate
        movements rapidly to unforeseen stimuli it is clearly
        better in women.<a id="footnotetag44"

    <p>We have no other than a utilitarian basis for judging some
    variations advantageous and others disadvantageous. We can
    estimate them only with reference to activity and the service
    or disservice to the individual and society implied in them,
    and a given variation must receive very different valuations at
    different historical periods in the development of the race.
    Departures from the normal are simply nature's way of "trying
    conclusions." The variations which have proved of life-saving
    advantage have in the course of time become typical, while the
    individuals in which unfavorable variations, or defects, have
    occurred have not survived in the struggle for existence.
    Morphologically men are the more unstable element of society,
    and this instability expresses itself in the two extremes of
    genius and idiocy. Genius in general is correlated with an
    excessive development in brain-growth, stopping dangerously
    near the line of hypertrophy and insanity; while microcephaly
    is a variation in the opposite direction, in which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> idiocy results from arrested
       development of the brain, usually through premature closing
       of the sutures; and both these variations occur more
       frequently in men than in women. There is also evidence that
       defects in general are more frequent in men than in
       women.</p>

    <p>A census of the insane in Prussia in 1880 showed that 9,809
    males and 7,827 females were born idiots. Koch's statistics of
    insanity show that in idiots there is almost always a majority
    of males, in the insane, a majority of females. But the
    majority of male idiots is so much greater than the majority of
    female insane that when idiots and insane are classed together
    there remains a majority of males.<a id="footnotetag47"

       conditions, and less dependent on imperfect or arrested
       cerebral development. Mayr has shown from statistics of
       Bavaria that insanity is infrequent before the sixteenth
       year; and even before the twentieth year the number of
       insane is not considerable.<a id="footnotetag48"

       greater than those of the male, and mortality is higher
       among insane men than among insane women. There is practical
       agreement among pathologists on

       Campbell points out in detail<a id="footnotetag50"
       name="footnotetag50"></a><a href="#footnote50"><sup>50</sup></a>
       that the male sex is more liable than the female to gross
       lesions of the nervous system&mdash;a fact which he
       attributes to the greater variability of the male.</p>

    <p>An excess of all other anatomical anomalies, except cleft
    palate, is reported among males. Manley reports that of 33
    cases of harelip treated by him only 6 were
    females.<a id="footnotetag51"

       It appears also that supernumerary digits are more frequent
       in males. Wilder<a id="footnotetag52"
       name="footnotetag52"></a><a href="#footnote52"><sup>52</sup></a>
       has recorded 152 cases of individuals with supernumerary
       digits, of whom 86 were males, 39 females, and 27 of unknown
       sex. A similar relation, according to Bruce, exists in
       regard to supernumerary nipples.<a id="footnotetag53"

       Cunningham noted an eighth (true) rib in 14 of 70 subjects
       examined. It occurred 7 times in males and 7 times in
       females, but the number of females examined was twice as
       large as the number of males.<a id="footnotetag56"
       name="footnotetag56"></a><a href="#footnote56"><sup>56</sup></a>
       The reports of the registrar-general show that for the years
       1884-88, inclusive, the deaths from congenital defects
       (spina bifida, imperforate anus, cleft palate, harelip,
       etc.) were, taking the average of the five years, 49.6 per
       million of the persons living in England for the male sex,
       and 44.2 for the female.<a id="footnotetag57"

    <p>It has already been noted as a general rule throughout
    nature that the male seeks the female
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> and physicians generally
       believe that men are sexually more active than

       and celibacy unquestionably impresses the character of women
       more deeply than that of man. Additional evidence of the
       greater sexual activity of man is furnished by the
       overwhelmingly large proportion of the various forms of
       sexual perversion reported by psychiatrists in the male
       sex.</p>

    <p>Pathological variations do not become fixed in the species,
    because of their disadvantageous nature, but their excess in
    the male is, as we have seen in the case of variations which
    have become fixed, an expression of the more energetic somatic
    habit of the male.</p>

    <p>A very noticeable expression of the anabolism of woman is
    her tendency to put on fat. "Women, as a class, show a greater
    tendency to put on fat than men, and the tendency is
    particularly well marked at puberty, when some girls become
    phenomenally stout."<a id="footnotetag60"

    <p>In tracing the transition from lower to higher forms of
    life, we find a great change in the nature of the blood, or
    what answers to the blood, and the constitution of the blood is
    some index of the intensity of the metabolic processes going on
    within the organism. The sap of plants is thin and watery,
    corresponding with the preponderant anabolism of the plant.
    "Blood is a peculiar kind of sap," and there is almost as much
    difference between this sap in warm-blooded and cold-blooded
    animals as between the latter and plants. Rich, red blood
    characterizes the forms of life fitted for activity and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
       id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span> bursts of energy. In his
       exhaustive work on the blood Hayem has given a summary of
       the results of the investigations of chemists and
       physiologists on the differences in the composition of the
       blood in the two sexes. Contrary to the assertion of Robin,
       Hayem finds that the white blood-corpuscles are not more
       numerous in women than in men, and he also states that the
       number of hæmatoblasts is the same in the two sexes. All
       chemists are agreed, however, that the number of red
       corpuscles is greater in men than in women. Nasse found in
       man 0.05824 of iron to 100, and in woman only 0.0499.
       Becquerel and Rodier give 0.0565 for man, 0.0511 for woman,
       and Schmidt, Scherer, and others give similar results.
       Welcker (using a chromometer) found between the corpuscles
       of man and woman the relation of 5 to 4.7, and Hayem
       confirmed this by numeration. Cadet found in woman on the
       average 4.9 million corpuscles per cubic millimeter, and in
       man 5.2 million. More recently Korniloff, using still
       another method&mdash;the spectroscope of Vierordt&mdash;has
       reached about the same result. The proportion of red
       blood-corpuscles varies according to individual
       constitution, race, and sex. In robust men Lacanu found 136
       red corpuscles in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span> 1,000; in weak men, only 116
       in 1,000; in robust women, only 126 in 1,000; and in weak
       women, 117.<a id="footnotetag61"
       name="footnotetag61"></a><a href="#footnote61"><sup>61</sup></a>
       Professor Jones has taken the specific gravity of the blood
       of above 1,500 individuals of all ages and of both
       sexes.<a id="footnotetag62"
       name="footnotetag62"></a><a href="#footnote62"><sup>62</sup></a>
       An examination of his charts shows that the specific gravity
       of the male is higher than that of the female between the
       ages of 16 and 68. Between the ages of 16 and 45 the average
       specific gravity of the male is about 1,058, and that of the
       female about 1,054.5. At 45 years the specific gravity of
       the male begins to fall rapidly and that of the female to
       rise rapidly, and at 55 they are almost equal; but the male
       remains slightly higher until 68 years, when it falls below
       that of the female. The period of marked difference in the
       specific gravity of the blood is thus seen to be coincident
       with the period of menstruation in the female. A chart
       constructed by Leichtenstern, based upon observations on 191
       individuals and showing variations in the amount of
       hæmoglobin with age, is also reproduced by Professor Jones,
       suggesting that the variations
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"
       id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span> in specific gravity of the
       blood with age and sex are closely related to variations in
       the amount of hæmoglobin. Leichtenstern states that the
       excess in men of hæmoglobin is 7 per cent. until the tenth
       year, 8 per cent. between 11 and 50 years, and 5 per cent.
       after the fiftieth year.<a id="footnotetag63"
       name="footnotetag63"></a><a href="#footnote63"><sup>63</sup></a>
       Jones states further<a id="footnotetag64"
       name="footnotetag64"></a><a href="#footnote64"><sup>64</sup></a>
       that the specific gravity is higher in persons of the upper
       classes and lower in the poorer classes. Observations of
       boys who were inmates of workhouses gave a mean specific
       gravity of 1,052.8 and on schoolboys a mean of 1,056, while
       among the undergraduate students of Cambridge University he
       found a mean of 1,059.5. Several men of very high specific
       gravity in the last group had distinguished themselves in
       athletics. "Workhouse boys are in most cases of poor
       physique, and one can hardly find a better antithesis than
       the general type of physique common among the athletic
       members of such a university as
       Cambridge."<a id="footnotetag65"
       name="footnotetag65"></a><a href="#footnote65"><sup>65</sup></a>
       There is no more conclusive evidence of an organic
       difference between man and woman than these tests of the
       blood. They permit us to associate a high specific gravity,
       red corpuscles, plentiful hæmoglobin, and a katabolic
       constitution.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"

    <p>A comparison of the waste products of the body and of the
    quantity of materials consumed in the metabolic process
    indicates a relatively larger consumption of energy by man. It
    is stated that man produces more urine than woman in the
    following proportion: men, 1,000 to 2,000 grams daily; women,
    1,000 to 1,400 grams. As age advances, the amount diminishes
    absolutely and relatively in proportion to the diminution of
    the energy of the metabolic process. A table prepared from
    adults of both sexes, twenty-five years of age, of the average
    weight of sixty kilograms, shows a larger proportion both of
    inorganic and organic substances in the urine of
    men.<a id="footnotetag66"
       name="footnotetag66"></a><a href="#footnote66"><sup>66</sup></a>
       Milne Edwards has found that the bones of the male are
       slightly richer in inorganic substances than those of the

    <p>The lung capacity of women is less, and they consume less
    oxygen and produce less carbonic acid than men of equal weight,
    although the number of respirations is slightly higher than in
    man. On this account women suffer deprivation of air more
    easily than men. They are not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span> so easily suffocated, and are
       reported to endure charcoal fumes better, and live in high
       altitudes where men cannot endure the deprivation of
       oxygen.<a id="footnotetag68"

       The number of deaths from chloroform is reckoned as from two
       to four times as great in males as in females, and this
       although chloroform is used in childbirth. Children also
       bear chloroform well.<a id="footnotetag69"
       name="footnotetag69"></a><a href="#footnote69"><sup>69</sup></a>
       Women, like children, require more sleep normally than men,
       but "Macfarlane states that they can better bear the loss of
       sleep, and most physicians will agree with him.... One of
       the greatest difficulties we have to contend with in nervous
       men is sleeplessness, a result, no doubt, of excessive
       katabolism."<a id="footnotetag70"
       name="footnotetag70"></a><a href="#footnote70"><sup>70</sup></a>
       Loss of sleep is a strain which, like gestation, women are
       able to meet because of their anabolic surplus. The fact
       that women undertake changes more reluctantly than men, but
       adjust themselves to changed fortunes more readily, is due
       to the same metabolic difference. Man has, in short, become
       somatically a more specialized animal than woman, and feels
       more keenly any disturbance of normal conditions,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> while he has not the same
       physiological surplus as woman with which to meet the
       disturbance.</p>

    <p>Lower forms of life have the remarkable quality of restoring
    a lost organ, and of living as separate individuals if divided.
    This power gradually diminishes as we ascend the scale of life,
    and is lost by the higher forms. It is a remarkable fact,
    however, that the lower human races, the lower classes of
    society, women and children, show something of the same quality
    in their superior tolerance of surgical disease. The
    indifference of savage races to wounds and loss of blood has
    everywhere been remarked by ethnologists. Dr. Bartels has
    formulated the law of resistance to surgical and traumatic
    treatment in the following sentence: "The higher the race, the
    less the tolerance, and the lower the culture-condition in a
    given race, the greater the tolerance."<a id="footnotetag71"

       The greater disvulnerability of women is generally
       recognized by surgeons. The following figures from Lawrie,

    <p>Legouest states in the same article that the lowest
    mortality of all is in children from 5 to 15 years of age.
    Ellis quotes a passage from a paper read by Lombroso at the
    International Congress of Experimental Psychology held in
    London:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Billroth experimented on women when attempting a certain
        operation (excision of the pylorus) for the first time,
        judging that they were less sensitive and therefore more
        <i>disvulnerable</i>, i.e., better able to resist pain.
        Carle assured me that women would let themselves be
        operated upon almost as though their flesh were an alien
        thing. Giordano told me that even the pains of childbirth
        caused relatively little suffering to women, in spite of
        their apprehensions. Dr. Martini, one of the most
        distinguished dentists of Turin, has informed me of the
        amazement he has felt at seeing women endure more easily
        and courageously than men every kind of dental operation.
        Mela, too, has found that men will, under such
        circumstances, faint oftener than
        women.<a id="footnotetag73"

    <p>The same tolerance of pain and misery in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"

       examination of the number of male and female suicides from
       physical suffering. Von Oettingen states that in 30,000

    <p>But the excess of male suicides over females is so great
    that, reckoned absolutely, about one woman to seven or ten men
    is driven by want to take her life.</p>

    <p>Physical suffering and want are among the motives which,
    constitutional differences aside, would appeal with about the
    same force to the two sexes. But the great excess both of
    suicide (3 or 4 men to 1 woman) and of crime (4 or 5 men to 1
    woman) in men, while directly conditioned by a manner of life
    more subject to vicissitude and catastrophe, is still remotely
    due to the male, katabolic tendency which has historically
    eventuated in a life of this nature in the male.</p>

    <p>or, a total mortality of 3,421 per million for the males and
    3,328 for the females. The greater fatality of diphtheria and
    whooping-cough in the female is attributed to the smaller
    larynx of girls, and to their habit of kissing. In diphtheria,
    indeed, the number of girls attacked is in excess of that of
    the boys, and it does not appear that their mortality is higher
    when this is considered.<a id="footnotetag78"

       Statistics based on nearly half a million deaths from

        <p>the mean mortality from all causes in the three cholera

        excess of the average mortality to 10,000 living; so
        females suffered less than males.... The mortality is
        higher in boys than in girls at all ages under 15; at the
        ages of reproduction, 25 to 45, the mortality of women,
        many of them pregnant, exceeds the mortality of men; but at
        the ages after 65 the mortality of men exceeds the
        mortality of women.<a id="footnotetag80"

    </blockquote>

    <p>Statistics show that woman is more susceptible to many
    diseases, but in less danger than man when attacked, because of
    her anabolic surplus, and also that the greatest mortality in
    woman is during the period of reproduction, when the specific
    gravity of the blood is low and her anabolic surplus small. It
    is significant also that the point of highest mortality from
    disease and of the highest rate of suicide in the female, as
    compared with the male, falls at about 15 years, and is to be
    associated with the rapid physiological changes preceding that
    time.<a id="footnotetag81"
       name="footnotetag81"></a><a href="#footnote81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

    <p>The numerical relation of the sexes at birth seems to be
    more variable in those regions where economic conditions and
    social usages are least settled, but in civilized countries the
    relation is fairly constant, and statistics of 32 countries and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> states between the years 1865
       and 1883 show that to every 100 girls 105 boys are born, or
       including stillborn, 100 girls to 106.6
       boys.<a id="footnotetag82"
       name="footnotetag82"></a><a href="#footnote82"><sup>82</sup></a>
       But the mortality of male children so much exceeds that of
       female that at the age of five the sexes are about in
       numerical equilibrium; and in the adult population of all
       European countries the average numerical relation of the
       sexes is reckoned as 102.1 women to 100 men. Von Oettingen
       gives a representative table;<a id="footnotetag83"
       name="footnotetag83"></a><a href="#footnote83"><sup>83</sup></a>
       compiled from statistics of eight European countries,
       showing that (omitting the stillborn) 124.71 boys to 100
       girls die before the end of the first year, and that between
       the years of 2 and 5 the proportion is 102.91 boys to 100
       girls; or, about 25 per cent. excess of boys in the first
       year, and 3 per cent. in the years between 1 and 5. In the
       intra-uterine period and at the very threshold of life the
       mortality of males is still greater. The figures of Wappaeus
       were 100 stillborn girls to 140.3 boys; Quetelet gave the
       proportion as 100:133.5; and the statistics of fourteen
       European countries during the years 1865-83 show that 130.2
       boys were stillborn to every 100 girls.<a id="footnotetag84"
       name="footnotetag84"></a><a href="#footnote84"><sup>84</sup></a>
       So that, while more boys than
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> girls are born living, still
       more are born dead. That this astonishingly high mortality
       is due in part to the somewhat larger size of boys at birth
       and the narrowness of the maternal pelvis is indicated by
       the statement of Collins, of the Rotunda Lying-in Hospital,
       Dublin, that within half an hour after birth only 1 female
       died to 16 males; within the first hour 2 females to 19
       males; and within the first 6 hours, 7 females to 29
       males.<a id="footnotetag85"
       name="footnotetag85"></a><a href="#footnote85"><sup>85</sup></a>
       But that this explanation is not sufficient is shown by the
       fact that a high mortality of boys extends through the whole
       of the first year, and through five years, in a diminishing
       ratio, and also that the tenacity of woman on life, as will
       be shown immediately, is greater at every age than man's
       except during a period of about five years following
       puberty. "There must be," says Ploss, "some cause which
       operates more energetically in the removal of male than of
       female children just before and after
       birth;"<a id="footnotetag86"
       name="footnotetag86"></a><a href="#footnote86"><sup>86</sup></a>
       but, besides the more violent movement of boys and their
       greater size, no explanation of the cause has been advanced
       more acceptably than Haushofer's teleological one, quoted by
       Ploss, that Nature wished to make a more perfect being of
       man and therefore threw more obstacles in his way. A
       satisfactory explanation is found if we
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> regard the young female as
       more anabolic, and more quiescent, with a stored surplus of
       nutriment by which in the helpless and critical period of
       change from intra- to extra-uterine conditions it is able to
       get its adjustment to life. The constructive phase of
       metabolism has prevailed in them even during fetal life.
       That there is need of a surplus of nutrition in the child at
       birth, or that a surplus will stand it in good stead, is
       indicated by the results of the weighing of children
       communicated by Winckel to the Gynaecological Society in
       Berlin in 1862. Winckel weighed 100 new-born children, 56
       boys and 44 girls, showing that birth was uniformly followed
       by a loss of weight. The average diminution was about 108
       grams the first day, and but little less the second day. At
       the end of five days the loss was 220 grams, six-sevenths of
       which occurred during the first two
       days.<a id="footnotetag87"

       The tendency to decreased vitality in girls after maturity
       and before marriage, just referred to, must be associated
       with the katabolic changes implied in menstruation and the
       newness to the system of this destructive phase of
       metabolism.</p>

    <p>We should expect the death-rate of men to run high during
    the period of manhood, in consequence
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span> of their greater exposure to
       peril, hardship, and the storm and stress of life. But two
       tendencies operate to reduce the comparative mortality of
       men between the twentieth and about the fortieth year: the
       fact of the severe male mortality in infancy, which has
       removed the constitutionally weak contingent, and the fact
       that during this period women are subject to death in
       connection with childbirth. So that in the prime of life the
       mortality of males does not markedly exceed that of females.
       But the statistics of longevity show that with the approach
       of old age the number of women of a given age surviving is
       in excess of the men, and that their relative tenacity of
       life increases with increasing years. Ornstein has shown,
       from the official statistics of Greece from 1878 to 1883,
       that in every period of five years between the ages of 85
       and 110 years and upward a larger number of women survive
       than of men, and in the following proportion:</p>

       gives a table showing the death-rate of centenarians in all
       France during a period of twenty years (1866-85). From this
       it appears that there died in these years an annual average
       of 73 centenarians, of whom 27 were men and 46 women. In
       only one year of the twenty did the deaths of men exceed
       those of women. Lombroso and Ferrero have shown that between
       1870 and 1879 the inhabitants of the prisons and convict
       establishments in Italy who were over 60 years of age showed
       a percentage of 4.3 among the women, and 3.2 among the men,
       although the number of men condemned to prison for long
       periods is far greater than among women.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Women are not only longer-lived than men, but have
        greater powers of resistance to misfortune and deep
        grief.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
           id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>

        <p>This is a well-known law, which in the case of the
        female criminal seems almost exaggerated, so remarkable is
        her longevity and the toughness with which she endures the
        hardships, even the prolonged hardships, of prison life....
        I know some denizens of female prisons who have reached the
        age of 90, having lived within those walls since they were
        29 without any grave injury to health.<a id="footnotetag91"
           name="footnotetag91"></a><a href="#footnote91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Woman's resistance to death is thus more marked at the two
    extremes of life, infancy and old age, the periods in which her
    anabolism is uninterrupted. Menstruation, reproduction, and
    lactation are at once the cause of an anabolic surplus and the
    means of getting rid of it. At the extremes of life no demand
    of this kind is made on woman, and her anabolic nature
    expresses itself at these times in greater resistance.</p>

    <p>Dr. Lloyd Jones has determined that between 17 and 45 years
    of age the specific gravity of the blood of women is lower than
    that of men. In old women the specific gravity rises above that
    of old men, and he suggests that their greater longevity is due
    to this.<a id="footnotetag92"
       name="footnotetag92"></a><a href="#footnote92"><sup>92</sup></a>
       No doubt the greater longevity of women is to be associated
       with the rise in specific gravity of their blood,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> but this rise in the specific
       gravity of women after 45 years is consequent upon their
       anabolic constitution. High specific gravity in general is
       associated with abundant and rich nutrition; it falls in
       women during pregnancy, lactation, and menstruation, and
       when these functions cease it is natural that the
       constructive metabolic tendency on which they are dependent
       should show itself in a heightened specific gravity of the
       blood (i.e., greater richness), and in consequence greater
       longevity.</p>

    <p>Some facts in the brain development of women point to the
    same conclusion. The growth of the brain is relatively more
    rapid in women than in men before the twentieth year. Between
    15 and 20 it has reached its maximum, and from that time there
    is a gradual decline in weight until about the fiftieth year,
    when there is an acceleration of growth, followed by a renewed
    diminution after the sixtieth year. The maximum of brain weight
    is almost reached by men at 20 years, but there is a slow
    increase until 30 or 35 years. There is then a diminution until
    the fiftieth year, followed by an acceleration, and at 60 years
    again a rapid diminution in weight; but the acceleration is
    more marked and the final diminution less marked in woman than
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"
       id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span> in man.<a id="footnotetag93"
       name="footnotetag93"></a><a href="#footnote93"><sup>93</sup></a>
       A table prepared by Topinard shows that woman from 20 to 60
       years of age has from 126 to 164 grams less brain weight
       than man, while her deficit from 60 to 90 years is from 123
       to 158 grams.<a id="footnotetag94"
       name="footnotetag94"></a><a href="#footnote94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

    <p>The only explanation at hand of this relative superiority of
    brain weight in old women is that with the close of the period
    of reproduction (the anabolic surplus being no longer consumed
    in the processes associated with reproduction) the constructive
    tendency still asserts itself, and a slight access of growth
    and vitality results to the organism.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>It must be confessed that the testimony of anthropologists
    on the difference in variability of men and women is to be
    accepted with great caution. As a class they have gone on the
    assumption that woman is an inferior creation, and have almost
    totally neglected to distinguish between the congenital
    characters of woman and those acquired as the result of a
    totally different relation to society on the part of women and
    men. They have also failed to appreciate the fact that
    differences from man are not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
       id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span> necessarily points of
       inferiority, but adaptations to different and specialized
       modes of functioning. But, whatever may be the final
       interpretation of details, I think the evidence is
       sufficient to establish the following main propositions: Man
       consumes energy more rapidly; woman is more conservative of
       it. The structural variability of man is mainly toward
       motion; woman's variational tendency is not toward motion,
       but toward reproduction. Man is fitted for feats of strength
       and bursts of energy; woman has more stability and
       endurance. While woman remains nearer to the infantile type,
       man approaches more to the senile. The extreme variational
       tendency of man expresses itself in a larger percentage of
       genius, insanity, and idiocy; woman remains more nearly
       normal.</p>

    <p>The fact that society is composed of two sexes, numerically
    almost equal, but differing in organic and social habits, is
    too significant to remain without influence on the structural
    and occupational sides of human life, and in the following
    chapters we shall note some of the influences of sex, and of
    the differences in bodily habit of men and women, on social
    forms and activities.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>

    <h2>SEX AND PRIMITIVE SOCIAL CONTROL</h2>

    <p>The greater strength and restlessness of man and the more
    stationary condition of woman have a striking social expression
    in the fact that the earliest groupings of population were
    about the females rather than the males.</p>

    <p>While at a disadvantage in point of force when compared with
    the male, the female has enjoyed a negative superiority in the
    fact that her sexual appetite was not so sharp as that of the
    male. Primitive man, when he desired a mate, sought her. The
    female was more passive and stationary. She exercised the right
    of choice, and had the power to transfer her choice more
    arbitrarily than has usually been recognized; but the need of
    protection and assistance in providing for offspring inclined
    her to a permanent union, and doubtless natural selection
    favored the groups in which parents co-operated in caring for
    the offspring. But assuming a relation permanent enough to be
    called marriage, the man was still, as compared with the woman,
    unsettled and unsocial. He secured food by violence or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
       id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span> cunning, and hunting and
       fighting were fit expressions of his somatic habit.</p>

    <p>The woman was the social nucleus, the point to which he
    returned from his wanderings. In this primitive stage of
    society, however, the bond between woman and child was
    altogether more immediate and constraining than the bond
    between woman and man. The maternal instinct is reinforced by
    necessary and constant association with the child. We can
    hardly find a parallel for the intimacy of association between
    mother and child during the period of lactation; and, in the
    absence of domesticated animals or suitable foods, and also,
    apparently, from simple neglect formally to wean the child,
    this connection is greatly prolonged. The child is frequently
    suckled from four to five years, and occasionally from ten to
    twelve.<a id="footnotetag95"
       name="footnotetag95"></a><a href="#footnote95"><sup>95</sup></a>
       In consequence we find society literally growing up about
       the woman. The mother and her children, and her children's
       children, and so on indefinitely in the female line, form a
       group. But the men were not so completely incorporated in
       this group as the women, not only because parentage was
       uncertain and naming of children
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> consequently on the female
       side, but because the man was neither by necessity nor
       disposition so much a home-keeper as the women and their
       children.</p>

    <p>The tangential disposition of the male is expressed in the
    system of exogamy so characteristic of tribal life. The
    movement toward exogamy doubtless originates in the
    restlessness of the male, the tendency to make new
    co-ordinations, the stimulus to seek more unfamiliar women, and
    the emotional interest in making unfamiliar sexual alliances.
    But, quite aside from its origin, exogamy is an energetic
    expression of the male nature. Natural selection favors the
    process by sparing the groups which by breeding out have
    heightened their physical vigor.<a id="footnotetag96"
       name="footnotetag96"></a><a href="#footnote96"><sup>96</sup></a>
       There results from this a social condition which, from the
       standpoint of modern ideas, is very curious. The man makes,
       and, by force of convention, finally must make, his
       matrimonial alliances only with women of other groups; but
       the woman still remains in her own group, and the children
       are members of her group, while the husband remains a member
       of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> his own clan, and is
       received, or may be received, as a guest in the clan of his
       wife. Upon his death his property is not shared by his
       children, nor by his wife, since these are not members of
       his clan; but it falls to the nearest of kin within his
       clan&mdash;usually to his sister's children.</p>

    <p>The maternal system of descent is found in all parts of the
    world where social advance stands at a certain level, and the
    evidence warrants the assumption that every group which
    advances to a culture state passes through this stage. Morgan
    gives an account of this system among the Iroquois:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Each household was made up on the principle of kin. The
        married women, usually sisters, own or collateral, were of
        the same gens or clan, the symbol or totem of which was
        often painted upon the house, while their husbands and the
        wives of their sons belonged to several other gentes. The
        children were of the gens of their mother. While husband
        and wife belonged to different gentes, the predominating
        number in each household would be of the same gens, namely,
        that of their mothers. As a rule the sons brought home
        their wives, and in some cases the husbands of the
        daughters were admitted to the maternal household. Thus
        each household was composed of a mixture of persons of
        different gentes, but this would not prevent the numerical
        ascendency of the particular gens to whom the house
        belonged. In a village of one hundred and twenty houses, as
        the Seneca village of Tiotohatton
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
           id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> described by Mr.
           Greenbalge in 1677, there would be several houses
           belonging to each gens. It presented a general picture
           of the Indian life in all parts of America at the epoch
           of European discovery.<a id="footnotetag97"
           name="footnotetag97"></a><a href="#footnote97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Morgan also quotes Rev. Ashur Wright, for many years a
    missionary among the Senecas and familiar with their language
    and customs:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>As to their family system, when occupying the old log
        houses, it is probable that some one clan predominated, the
        women taking in husbands, however, from the other clans,
        and sometimes for novelty, some of their sons bringing in
        their young wives until they felt brave enough to leave
        their mothers. Usually the female portion ruled the house,
        and were doubtless clannish enough about it. The stores
        were in common, but woe to the luckless husband or lover
        who was too shiftless to do his share of the providing. No
        matter how many children or whatever goods he might have in
        the house, he might at any time be ordered to pick up his
        blanket and budge, and after such orders it would not be
        healthful for him to attempt to disobey; the house would
        become too hot for him, and, unless saved by the
        intercession of some aunt or grandmother, he must retreat
        to his own clan, or, as was often done, go and start a new
        matrimonial alliance in some other. The women were the
        great power among the clans as everywhere else. They did
        not hesitate, when occasion required, to "knock off the
        horns," so it was technically called, from the head of a
        chief and send him back
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
           id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> to the ranks of the
           warriors. The original nomination of the chiefs, also,
           always rested with them.<a id="footnotetag98"
           name="footnotetag98"></a><a href="#footnote98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Traces of the maternal system are everywhere found on the
    American continent, and in some regions it is still in force.
    McGee says of the Seri stock of the southwest coast, now
    reduced to a single tribe, that the claims of a suitor are
    pressed by his female relatives, and, if the suit is favorably
    regarded by the mother and uncles of the girl, the suitor is
    provisionally installed in the house, without purchase price
    and presents. He is then expected to show his worthiness of a
    permanent relation by demonstrating his ability as a provider,
    and by showing himself an implacable foe to aliens. He must
    support all the female relatives of his bride's family by the
    products of his skill and industry in hunting and fishing for a
    year. He is the general protector of the girl's family, and
    especially of the girl, whose bower and pelican-skin couch he
    shares, "not as husband, but as continent companion," for a
    year. If all goes well, he is then permanently received as
    "consort-guest," and his children are added to the clan of his
    mother-in-law.<a id="footnotetag99"
       name="footnotetag99"></a><a href="#footnote99"><sup>99</sup></a>
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
       id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span> With few exceptions, descent
       was formerly reckoned in Australia in the female line, and
       the usage survives in some regions. Howitt, in a letter to
       Professor Tylor, reports of the tribes near Maryborough,
       Queensland:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>When a man marries a woman from a distant locality, he
        goes to her tribelet and identifies himself with her
        people. This is a rule with very few exceptions. Of course,
        I speak of them as they were in their wild state. He
        becomes a part of, and one of, the family. In the event of
        a war expedition, the daughter's husband acts as a
        blood-relation, and will fight and kill his own
        blood-relations, if blows are struck by his wife's
        relations. I have seen a father and son fighting under
        these circumstances, and the son would most certainly have
        killed the father, if others had not
        interfered.<a id="footnotetag100"
           name="footnotetag100"></a><a href="#footnote100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In Australia there is also a very sharp social expression of
    the fact of sex in the division of the group into male and
    female classes in addition to the division into
    clans.<a id="footnotetag101"
       name="footnotetag101"></a><a href="#footnote101"><sup>101</sup></a>
       In the Malay Archipelago the same system is found.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Among the Padang Malays the child always belongs to its
        mother's <i>suku</i>, and all blood-relationship is
        reckoned through the wife as the real transmitter of the
        family, the husband being only a stranger. For this reason
        his heirs are not his own children, but the children of his
        sister, his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"
           id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span> brothers, and other
           uterine relations; children are the natural heirs of
           their mother only.... We may assume that, wherever
           exogamy is now found coexisting with inheritance through
           the father (as among Rejangs and Bataks, the people of
           Nias and Timor, or the Alfurs of Ceram and Buru), this
           was formerly through the mother; and that the other
           system has grown up out of dislike to the inconveniences
           arising from the insecure and dependent condition of the
           husband in the wife's family.<a id="footnotetag102"

       are traceable to an earlier maternal organization.</p>

    <p>All ethnologists admit that descent through females has been
    very widespread, but some deny that this system has been
    universally prevalent at any stage of culture. Those who have
    diminished its importance, however, have done so chiefly in
    reinforcement of their denials of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> theory of promiscuity. It has
       been very generally assumed that maternal descent is due
       solely to uncertainty of paternity, and that an admission
       that the maternal system has been universal is practically
       an admission of promiscuity. Opponents of this theory have
       consequently felt called upon to minimize the importance of
       maternal descent.<a id="footnotetag120"
       name="footnotetag120"></a><a href="#footnote120"><sup>120</sup></a>
       But descent through females is not, in fact, fully explained
       by uncertainty of parentage on the male side. It is due to
       the larger social fact, including this biological one, that
       the bond between mother and child is the closest in nature,
       and that the group grew up about the more stationary female;
       and consequently the questions of maternal descent and
       promiscuity are by no means so inseparable as has commonly
       been assumed. We may accept Sir Henry Maine's terse remark
       that "paternity is a matter of inference, as opposed to
       maternity, which is a matter of
       observation,"<a id="footnotetag121"
       name="footnotetag121"></a><a href="#footnote121"><sup>121</sup></a>
       without concluding that society would have been first of all
       patriarchal in organization, even if paternity had been also
       a matter of observation. For the association of the woman
       with the child is immediate
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
       id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span> and perforce, but the
       immediate interest of the man is in the woman, through the
       power of her sexual attractiveness, and his interest in the
       child is secondary and mediated through her. This relation
       being a constant one, having its roots in the nature of sex
       rather than in the uncertainty of parentage, we may safely
       conclude that the so-called "mother-right" has everywhere
       preceded "father-right," and was the fund from which the
       latter was evolved.</p>

    <p>But while it is natural that the children and the group
    should grow up about the mother, it is not conceivable that
    woman should definitely or long control the activities of
    society, especially on their motor side. In view of his
    superior power of making movements and applying force, the male
    must inevitably assume control of the life direction of the
    group, no matter what the genesis of the group. It is not a
    difficult conclusion that, if woman's leaping, lifting,
    running, climbing, and slugging capacity is inferior to man's,
    by however slight a margin, her fighting capacity is less in
    the same degree; for battle is only an application of force,
    and there has never been a moment in the history of society
    when the law of might, tempered by sexual affinity, did not
    prevail. We must then, in fact, recognize a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> sharp distinction between the
       law of descent and the fact of authority.</p>

    <p>The male was everywhere present in primitive society, and
    everywhere made his force felt. We can see this illustrated
    most plainly in the animal group, where the male is the leader,
    by virtue of his strength. There is also a stage of human
    society which may be called the prematriarchal stage, from the
    fact that ideas of kinship are so feeble that no extensive
    social filiation is effected through this principle, in
    consequence of which the group has not reached the tribal stage
    of organization on the basis of kinship, but remains in the
    primitive biological relation of male, female, and offspring.
    The Botocudos, Fuegians, Eskimos, West Australians, Bushmen,
    and Veddahs represent this primitive stage more or less
    completely; they have apparently not reached the stage where
    the fact of kinship expresses itself in maternal organization.
    They live in scattered bands, held together loosely by
    convenience, safety, and inertia, and the male is the leader;
    but the leadership of the male in this case, as among animals,
    is very different from the organized and institutional
    expression of the male force in systems of political control
    growing out of achievement. This involves a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"
       id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span> social history through which
       these low tribes have not passed.</p>

    <p>Organization cannot proceed very far in the absence of
    social mass, and the collection of social mass took place
    unconsciously about the female as a universal preliminary of
    the conscious synthetization of the mass through males. From
    the side of organization, the negative accretion of population
    about female centers and filiation through blood is very
    precious, since filiation based on relation to females prepares
    the way for organization based on motor
    activities.<a id="footnotetag122"
       name="footnotetag122"></a><a href="#footnote122"><sup>122</sup></a>
       But in the prematernal stage, in the maternal stage, and in
       the patriarchal stage the male force was present and was the
       carrier of the social will. In the fully maternal system,
       indeed, the male authority is only thinly veiled, or not at
       all. Filiation through female descent precedes filiation
       through achievement, because it is a function of somatic
       conditions, in the main, while filiation through achievement
       is a function <span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
       id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> of historical conditions.
       This advantage of maternal organization in point of time
       embarrasses and obscures the individual and collective
       expression of the male force, but under the veil of female
       nomenclature and in the midst of the female organization we
       can always detect the presence of the male authority.
       Bachofen's conception of the maternal system as a political
       system was erroneous, as Dargun and others have pointed
       out,<a id="footnotetag123"
       name="footnotetag123"></a><a href="#footnote123"><sup>123</sup></a>
       though woman has been reinforced by the fact of descent, and
       has so figured somewhat in political systems.</p>

    <p>A most instructive example of the parallel existence of
    descent through females and of male authority is found in the
    Wyandot tribe of Indians, in which also the participation of
    woman in the regulative activities of society is, perhaps, more
    systematically developed than in any other single case among
    maternal peoples. Major Powell gives the following outline of
    the civil and military government of this tribe:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The civil government inheres in a system of councils and
        chiefs. In each gens there is a council, composed of four
        women, called <i>Yu-waí-yu-wá-na</i>. These four women
        councilors select a chief of the gens from its male
        members&mdash;that is, from their brothers and sons. This
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
           id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span> gentile chief is the head
           of the gentile council. The council of the tribe is
           composed of the aggregated gentile councils. The tribal
           council, therefore, is composed one-fifth of men and
           four-fifths of women. The sachem of the tribe, or tribal
           chief, is chosen by the chiefs of the gentes. There is
           sometimes a grand council of the gens, composed of the
           councilors of the gens proper and all the heads of
           households (women) and leading men&mdash;brothers and
           sons. There is also a grand council of the tribe,
           composed of the council of the tribe proper and the
           heads of households of the tribe, and all the leading
           men of the tribe....</p>

        <p>The four women councilors of the gens are chosen by the
        heads of households, themselves being women. There is no
        formal election, but frequent discussion is had over the
        matter from time to time, in which a sentiment grows up
        within the gens and throughout the tribe that, in the event
        of the death of any councilor, a certain person will take
        her place. In this manner there are usually one, two, or
        more potential councilors in each gens, who are expected to
        attend all the meetings of the council, though they take no
        part in the deliberations and have no vote. When a woman is
        installed as a councilor, a feast is prepared by the gens
        to which she belongs, and to this feast all the members of
        the tribe are invited. The woman is painted and dressed in
        her best attire, and the sachem of the tribe places upon
        her head the gentile chaplet of feathers, and announces in
        a formal manner to the assembled guests that the woman has
        been chosen a councilor.... The gentile chief is chosen by
        the council women after consultation with the other women
        and men of the gens. Often the gentile chief is a potential
        chief through a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
           id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span> period of probation.
           During this time he attends the meetings of the council,
           but takes no part in the deliberations and has no vote.
           At his installation, the council women invest him with
           an elaborately ornamented tunic, place upon his head a
           chaplet of feathers, and paint the gentile totem upon
           his face.... The sachem of the tribe is selected by the
           men belonging to the council of the tribe.</p>

        <p>The management of military affairs inheres in the
        military council and chief. The military council is
        composed of all the able-bodied men of the tribe; the
        military chief is chosen by the council from the Porcupine
        gens. Each gentile chief is responsible for the military
        training of the youth under his authority. There are
        usually one or more potential military chiefs, who are the
        close companions and assistants of the chief in time of war
        and, in case of the death of the chief, take his place in
        the order of seniority.<a id="footnotetag124"
           name="footnotetag124"></a><a href="#footnote124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In this tribe the numerical recognition of women is
    striking, and indicates that they are the original core of
    society. They are still responsible for society, in a way, but
    all the offices involving motor activity are deputed to men.
    Thus women, as heads of households, choose four women
    councilors of the clan (gens), and these choose the fifth
    member, who is a man and the head of the council and chief of
    the clan. The tribal chief is, however, chosen by males,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
       id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> and in the military
       organization, which represents the group capacity for
       violence, the women have not even a nominal recognition. The
       real authority rests with those who are most fit to exercise
       it. Female influence persists as a matter of habit, until,
       under the pressure of social, particularly of military,
       activities, the breaking-up of the habit and a new
       accommodation follows the accumulation of a larger fund of
       social energy.</p>

    <p>The men of any group are at any time in possession of the
    force to change the habits of the group and push aside any
    existing system. But the savage is not revolutionary; his life
    and his social sanctions are habitual. He is averse to change
    as such, and retains form and rite after their meaning is lost.
    We consequently find an expression of social respect for woman
    under the maternal system suggestive of chivalry, and even a
    formal elevation of women to authority in groups where the
    actual control is in the hands of men.</p>

    <p>In the Mariana Islands the position of woman was distinctly
    superior; even when the man had contributed an equal share of
    property on marriage, the wife dictated everything and the man
    could undertake nothing without her approval;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"
       id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span> but, if the woman committed
       an offense, the man was held responsible and suffered the
       punishment. The women could speak in the assembly, they held
       property, and if a woman asked anything of a man, he gave it
       up without a murmur. If a wife was unfaithful, the husband
       could send her home, keep her property, and kill the
       adulterer; but if the man was guilty, or even suspected of
       the same offense, the women of the neighborhood destroyed
       his house and all his visible property, and the owner was
       fortunate if he escaped with a whole skin; and if a wife was
       not pleased with her husband, she withdrew, and a similar
       attack followed. On this account many men were not married,
       preferring to live with paid women. Likewise, in the Gilbert
       Islands a man shows the same respect to a woman as to a
       chief, by stepping aside when he meets her. If a man strikes
       a woman, the other women drive him from the tribe. On
       Lukunor the men used, in conversation with women, not the
       usual, but a deferential form of
       language.<a id="footnotetag125"
       name="footnotetag125"></a><a href="#footnote125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>

    <p>The discoverers of the Friendly Islands found there a king
    in authority over the people, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
       id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> his wife in control of the
       king, receiving homage from him, but not
       ruling.<a id="footnotetag126"
       name="footnotetag126"></a><a href="#footnote126"><sup>126</sup></a>
       In these and similar cases woman's early relation to the
       household is formally retained in the larger group and in
       the presence of an obviously masculine form of
       organization.</p>

    <p>But, in contrast with the survival in political systems of
    the primitive respect shown mothers, we find the assertion of
    individual male force within the very bosom of the maternal
    organization, in the person of the husband, brother, or uncle
    of the woman. Among the Caribs "the father or head of the
    household exerts unlimited authority over his wives and
    children, but this authority is not founded on legal rights,
    but upon his physical superiority."<a id="footnotetag127"
       name="footnotetag127"></a><a href="#footnote127"><sup>127</sup></a>
       In spite of the maternal system in North America, the women
       were often roughly handled by their husbands. Schoolcraft
       says of the Kenistenos: "When a young man marries, he
       immediately goes to live with the father and mother of his
       wife, who treat him, nevertheless, as an entire stranger
       till after the birth of his first child." But</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>it appears that chastity is considered by them as a
        virtue ... and it sometimes happens that the infidelity of
        a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
           id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span> wife is punished by the
           husband with the loss of her hair, nose, or perhaps
           life. Such severity proceeds, perhaps, less from
           rigidity of virtue than from its having been practiced
           without his permission; for a temporary interchange of
           wives is not uncommon, and the offer of their persons is
           considered as a necessary part of the hospitality due to
           strangers.<a id="footnotetag128"
           name="footnotetag128"></a><a href="#footnote128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Schoolcraft also says of the women of the Chippeways, among
    whom the maternal system had given way:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>They are very submissive to their husbands, who have
        however, their fits of jealousy; and for very trifling
        causes treat them with such cruelty as sometimes to
        occasion their death. They are frequently objects of
        traffic, and the father possesses the right of disposing of
        his daughter.<a id="footnotetag129"

    </blockquote>

    <p>Indian fathers also frequently sold their children, without
    any show of right. "Kane mentions that the Shastas ...
    frequently sell their children as slaves to the
    Chinooks."<a id="footnotetag130"

       Bancroft says of the Columbians: "Affection for children is
       by no means rare, but in few tribes can they resist the
       temptation to sell or gamble them
       away."<a id="footnotetag131"

       Descent through mothers is in force among the negroes of
       equatorial Africa, the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> man's property passing to his
       sister's children; but the father is an unlimited despot,
       and no one dares to oppose him. So long as his relation with
       his wives continues, he is master of them and of their
       children. He can even sell the latter into
       slavery.<a id="footnotetag132"

       In New Britain maternal descent prevails, but wives are
       obtained by purchase or capture, and are practically slaves;
       they are cruelly treated, carry on agriculture, and bear
       burdens which make them prematurely stooped, and are likely,
       if their husbands are offended, to be killed and
       eaten.<a id="footnotetag133"

    <p>In many regions of Australia women are treated with extreme
    brutality, when their work is not satisfactory, or the husband
    has any other cause for offense. In Victoria the men often
    break their staves over the heads of the women, and skulls of
    women have been found in which knitted fractures indicated
    former ill-treatment. In Cape York the women are beaten, and in
    the interior an angry native burned his wife alive. In the
    Adelaide dialect the phrase "owner of a woman" means husband.
    When a man dies, his uterine brother inherits his wife and
    children.<a id="footnotetag134"

    <p>Where under an exogamous system of marriage a man is forced
    to go outside his group to obtain a wife, he may do this either
    by going over to her group, by taking possession of her
    violently, or by offering her and the members of her group
    sufficient inducements to relinquish her; and the contrasted
    male and female disposition is expressed in all the forms of
    marriage incident to the exogamous system. Every exogamous
    group is naturally reluctant to relinquish its women, both
    because it has in them laborers and potential mothers whose
    children will be added to the group, and because, in the event
    of their remaining in the group after marriage, their husbands
    become additional defenders and providers within the group.
    Where the husband is to settle in the family of the wife, a
    test is consequently often made of his ability as a provider.
    Among the Zuni Indians there is no purchase price, no general
    exchange of gifts; but as soon as the agreement is reached, the
    young man must undertake certain duties:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>He must work in the field of his prospective
        mother-in-law, that his strength and industry may be
        tested; he must collect fuel and deposit it near the
        maternal domicile, that his disposition as a provider may
        be made known; he must chase and slay the deer, and make
        from an entire buckskin a pair of moccasins for the bride,
        and from other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
           id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span> skins and textiles a
           complete feminine suit, to the end that his skill in
           hunting, skin-dressing, and weaving may be displayed;
           and, finally, he must fabricate or obtain for the
           maiden's use a necklace of seashell or of silver, in
           order that his capacity for long journeys or successful
           barter may be established; but if circumstances prevent
           him from performing these duties actually, he may
           perform them symbolically, and such performance is
           usually acceptable to the elder people. After these
           preliminaries are completed, he is formally adopted by
           his wife's parents, yet remains merely a perpetual
           guest, subject to dislodgment at his wife's behest,
           though he cannot legally withdraw from the covenant; if
           dissatisfied, he can only so ill-treat his wife or
           children as to compel his
           expulsion.<a id="footnotetag135"
           name="footnotetag135"></a><a href="#footnote135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This practice is seen in a symbolical form where presents
    are required of the suitor before marriage and their equivalent
    returned later. By depositing goods accumulated through his
    activities he demonstrates his ability as a provider, without
    undergoing a formal test. This practice is reported of the
    Indians of Oregon:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The suitor never, in person, asks the parents for their
        daughter; but he sends one or more friends, whom he pays
        for their services. The latter sometimes effect their
        purposes by feasts. The offer generally includes a
        statement of the property which will be given for the wife
        to the parents, consisting of horses, blankets, or buffalo
        robes. The wife's relations always raise as many horses (or
        other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
           id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> property) for her dower
           as the bridegroom has sent the parents, but scrupulously
           take care not to turn over the same horses or the same
           articles.... This is the custom alike of the
           Walla-Wallas, Nez-Percés, Cayuse, Waskows, Flatheads,
           and Spokanes.<a id="footnotetag136"
           name="footnotetag136"></a><a href="#footnote136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

        <p>In Patagonia the usual custom is for the bridegroom,
        after he has secured the consent of his damsel, to send
        either a brother or some intimate friend to the parents,
        offering so many mares, horses, or silver ornaments for the
        bride. If the parents consider the match desirable, as soon
        after as circumstances will permit, the bridegroom, dressed
        in his best, and mounted on his best horse, proceeds to the
        toldo of his intended, and hands over the gifts; the
        parents then return gifts of equivalent value, which,
        however, in the event of a separation are the property of
        the bride.<a id="footnotetag137"
           name="footnotetag137"></a><a href="#footnote137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Marriage by capture is an immediate expression of male
    force. Like marriage by settlement in the house of the wife, it
    is an expedient for obtaining a wife outside the group where
    marriage by purchase is not developed, or where the suitor
    cannot offer property for the bride. It is an unsocial
    procedure and does not persist in a growing society, for it
    involves retaliation and blood-feud. But it is a desperate
    means of avoiding the constraint and embarrassment of a
    residence in the family and among the relatives
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"
       id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span> of the wife, where the power
       of the husband is hindered, and the male disposition is not
       satisfied in this matter short of personal ownership.</p>

    <p>The man also sometimes lives under the maternal system in
    regular marriage, but escapes its disadvantages by stealing a
    supplementary wife or purchasing a slave woman, over whom and
    whose children he has full authority. In the Babar Archipelago,
    where the maternal system persists, even in the presence of
    marriage by purchase (the man living in the house of the woman,
    and the children reckoned with the mother), it is considered
    highly honorable to steal an additional wife from another
    group, and in this case the children belong to the
    father.<a id="footnotetag138"
       name="footnotetag138"></a><a href="#footnote138"><sup>138</sup></a>
       Among the Kinbundas of Africa children belong to the
       maternal uncle, who has the right to sell them, while the
       father regards as his children in fact the offspring of a
       slave woman, and these he treats as his personal property.
       To the same effect, among the Wanyamwesi, south of the
       Victoria Nyanza, the children of a slave wife inherit, to
       the exclusion of children born of a legal wife. And husbands
       among the Fellatahs <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
       id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span> are in the habit of adopting
       children, though they may have sons or daughters of their
       own, and the adopted children inherit the
       property.<a id="footnotetag139"
       name="footnotetag139"></a><a href="#footnote139"><sup>139</sup></a>
       In Indonesia a man sometimes marries a woman and settles in
       her family, and the children belong to her. But he may later
       carry her forcibly to his own group, and the children then
       belong to him.<a id="footnotetag140"
       name="footnotetag140"></a><a href="#footnote140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>

    <p>Bosman relates that in Guinea religious symbolism was also
    introduced by the husband to reinforce and lend dignity to this
    action. The maternal system held with respect to the chief
    wife:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>It was customary, however, for a man to buy and take to
        wife a slave, a friendless person with whom he could deal
        at pleasure, who had no kindred that could interfere for
        her, and to consecrate her to his Bossum or god. The Bossum
        wife, slave as she had been, ranked next to the chief wife,
        and was like her exceptionally treated. She alone was very
        jealously guarded, she alone was sacrificed at her
        husband's death. She was, in fact, wife in a peculiar
        sense. And having, by consecration, been made of the
        kindred and worship of her husband, her children would be
        born of his kindred and worship.<a id="footnotetag141"
           name="footnotetag141"></a><a href="#footnote141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Altogether the most satisfactory means of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"
       id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span> removing a girl from her
       group is to purchase her. The use of property in the
       acquisition of women is not a particular expression of the
       male nature, since property is accumulated by females as
       well; but where this form of marriage exists it means
       practically that the male relatives of the girl are using
       her for profit, and that her suitor is seeking more complete
       control of her than he can gain in her group; and viewed in
       this light the purchase and sale of women is an expression
       of the dominant nature of the male. In consequence of
       purchase, woman became in barbarous society a chattel, and
       her socially constrained position in history and the present
       hindrances to the outflow of her activities are to be traced
       largely to the system of purchasing wives.</p>

    <p>The simplest form of purchase is to give a woman in
    exchange. "The Australian male almost invariably obtains his
    wife or wives either as the survivor of a married elder brother
    or in exchange for his sisters, or, later in life, for his
    daughters."<a id="footnotetag142"
       name="footnotetag142"></a><a href="#footnote142"><sup>142</sup></a>
       A wife is also often sold on credit, but kept at home until
       the price is paid. On the island of Serang a youth belongs
       to the family of the girl, living according to her customs
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> and religion until the
       bride-price is paid. He then takes both wife and children to
       his tribe. But in case he is very poor, he never pays the
       price, and remains perpetually in the tribe of his
       wife.<a id="footnotetag143"
       name="footnotetag143"></a><a href="#footnote143"><sup>143</sup></a>
       Among the Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia the maternal
       has only barely given way to the paternal system, and the
       form of marriage reflects both systems. The suitor sends a
       messenger with blankets, and the number sent is doubled
       within three months, making in all about one hundred and
       fifty. These are to be returned later. He is then allowed to
       live with the girl in her father's house. Three months later
       the husband gives perhaps a hundred blankets more for
       permission to take his wife home.<a id="footnotetag144"
       name="footnotetag144"></a><a href="#footnote144"><sup>144</sup></a>
       Among the Makassar and Beginese stems of Indionesia the
       purchase of a wife involves only a partial relinquishment of
       the claim of the maternal house on the girl; the purchase
       price is paid by instalments and all belongs to the mother's
       kindred in case full payment is not made. A compromise
       between the two systems is made on the Molucca Islands,
       where children born before the bride-price
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> is paid belong to the
       mother's side, after that to the
       father's.<a id="footnotetag145"

    <p>So long as a wife remained in her group, she could rely upon
    her kindred for protection against ill-usage from her husband,
    but she forfeited this advantage when she passed to his group.
    An Arabian girl replies to her father, when a chief seeks her
    in marriage: "No! I am not fair of face, and I have infirmities
    of temper, and I am not his <i>bint'amm</i> (tribeswoman), so
    that he should respect my consanguinity with him, nor does he
    dwell in thy country, so that he should have regard for thee; I
    fear then that he may not care for me and may divorce me, and
    so I shall be in an evil case."<a id="footnotetag146"

       The Hassanyeh Arabs of the White Nile region in Egypt afford
       a curious example of the conflict of male and female
       interests in connection with marriage, in which the female
       passes by contract for only a portion of her time under the
       authority of the male:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>When the parents of the man and woman meet to settle the
        price of the woman, the price depends on how many days in
        the week the marriage tie is to be strictly observed. The
        woman's mother first of all proposes that,
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
           id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span> taking everything into
           consideration, with a due regard for the feelings of the
           family, she could not think of binding her daughter to a
           due observance of that chastity which matrimony is
           expected to command for more than two days in the week.
           After a great deal of apparently angry discussion, and
           the promise on the part of the relatives of the man to
           pay more, it is arranged that the marriage shall hold
           good, as is customary among the first families of the
           tribe, for four days in the week, viz.: Monday, Tuesday,
           Wednesday, and Thursday; and, in compliance with
           old-established custom, the marriage rites during the
           three remaining days shall not be insisted on, during
           which days the bride shall be perfectly free to act as
           she may think proper, either by adhering to her husband
           and home, or by enjoying her freedom and independence
           from all observation of matrimonial
           obligations.<a id="footnotetag147"
           name="footnotetag147"></a><a href="#footnote147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We may understand also that the tolerance of loose conduct
    in girls before marriage&mdash;a tolerance which amounts in
    many tribes to approval&mdash;is due to the tribal recognition
    of the value of children, and children born out of marriage are
    added to the family of the mother. When, on the other hand, the
    conduct of the girl is strictly watched, this is from a
    consideration that virgins command a higher bride-price.
    Child-marriages and long betrothals are means
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> of guaranteeing the proper
       conduct of a girl to her husband, as they constitute a
       personal claim and afford him an opportunity to throw more
       restrictions about her. So that, in any case, the conduct of
       the girl is viewed with reference to her value to the
       tribe.</p>

    <p>A social grouping which is not the product of forces more
    active in their nature than the reproductive force may be
    expected to yield before male motor activities, when these are
    for any reason sufficiently formulated. The primitive warrior
    and hunter comes into honor and property through a series of
    movements involving judgments of time and space, and the
    successful direction of force, aided by mechanical appliances
    and mediated through the hand and the eye. Whether directed
    against the human or the animal world, the principle is the
    same; success and honor and influence in tribal life depend on
    the application of violence at the proper time, in the right
    direction, and in sufficient measure; and this is pre-eminently
    the business of the male. The advantage of acting in concert in
    war and hunting, and under the leadership of those who have
    shown evidence of the best judgment in these matters, is felt
    in any body of men who are held together by any tie;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> and the first tie is the tie
       of blood, by which we should understand, not that primitive
       man has any sentimental feeling about kinship, but that he
       is psychologically inseparable from those among whom he was
       born and with whom he has to do. Though the father's sense
       of kinship and interest in his children is originally
       feeble, it increases with the growth of consciousness in
       connection with various activities, and, at the point in
       race development when chieftainship is hereditary in the
       clan and personal property is recognized, the father
       realizes the awkwardness of a social system which reckons
       his children as members of another clan and forces him to
       bequeath his rank and possessions to his sister's children,
       or other members of his own group, rather than to his
       children. The Navajoes<a id="footnotetag148"
       name="footnotetag148"></a><a href="#footnote148"><sup>148</sup></a>
       and Nairs,<a id="footnotetag149"

       and ancient Egyptians<a id="footnotetag150"
       name="footnotetag150"></a><a href="#footnote150"><sup>150</sup></a>
       avoided this unpleasant condition by giving their property
       to their children during their own lifetime; and the
       Shawnees, Miamis, Sauks, and Foxes avoided it by naming the
       children into the clan of the father, giving a child a
       tribal name being equivalent to
       adoption.<a id="footnotetag151"
       name="footnotetag151"></a><a href="#footnote151"><sup>151</sup></a>
       The cleverest bit of primitive politics
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> of which we have record is
       the device employed in ancient Peru, and surviving in
       historical times in Egypt and elsewhere in the East, by
       which the ruler married his own sister, contrary to the
       exogamous practice of the common folk. The children might
       then be regularly reckoned as of the kin of the mother,
       indeed, but they were at the same time of and in the group
       of the father, and the king secured the succession of his
       own son by marrying the woman whose son would traditionally
       succeed.</p>

    <p>As we should expect, the desirability of modifying the
    system of descent and inheritance through females is felt first
    in connection with situations of honor and profit. At the time
    of the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands the government was a
    brutal despotism, presenting many of the features of feudalism;
    the people prostrated themselves before the king and before
    objects which he had touched, and a man suffered death whose
    shadow fell upon the king, or who went uncovered within the
    shadow of the king's house, or even looked upon the king by
    day.<a id="footnotetag152"
       name="footnotetag152"></a><a href="#footnote152"><sup>152</sup></a>
       But descent was in the female line, with a tendency to
       transfer to the male line in case of the king, and among
       chiefs, priests, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
       id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>
       nobility.<a id="footnotetag153"
       name="footnotetag153"></a><a href="#footnote153"><sup>153</sup></a>
       This assertion of the male authority was sometimes resented,
       however, and was a source of frequent trouble. Wilkes states
       that there was formerly no regularly established order of
       succession to the throne; the children of the chief wife had
       the best claim, but the king often named his own successor,
       and this gave rise to violent
       conflicts.<a id="footnotetag154"

    marks (totemism, circumcision, tattooing, scarification), and
    religious dedication are devices by which, consciously or
    unconsciously, the men escape from the tyranny of the maternal
    system. We cannot assume that these practices originate solely
    or largely in dissatisfaction, for the men would feel the
    advantage of a combination of interests whenever brought into
    association with one another; but these artificial bonds and
    their display to the eye are among the first attempts to
    synthetize the male forces of the group, and it is quite
    apparent that such unions are unfavorable to the continuance of
    the influence of women and of the system which they represent.
    In West Africa and among some of the negro tribes the
    initiatory <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
       id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span> ceremony is apparently
       deliberately hostile to the maternal organization. The youth
       is taken from the family of his mother, symbolically killed
       and buried, resurrected by the priests into a male
       organization, and dedicated to his father's
       god.<a id="footnotetag155"

    <p>Spatial conditions have played an important rôle also in the
    development of societies. Through movements the individual or
    the group is able to pick and choose advantageous relations,
    and by changing its location adjust itself to changes in the
    food conditions. That the success of the group is definitely
    related to its motor capacity is revealed by the following law
    of population, worked out by statisticians for the three
    predominant races of modern Europe: In countries inhabited
    jointly by these three races, the race possessing the smallest
    portion of wealth and the smallest representation among the
    more influential and educated classes constitutes also the
    least migratory element of the population, and tends in the
    least degree to concentrate in the cities and the more fertile
    regions of the country; and in countries inhabited jointly by
    the three races, the race possessing the largest portion of
    wealth and the largest <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> representation among the more
       influential and educated classes is also the most migratory
       element of the population, and tends in the greatest degree
       to concentrate in the cities and the more fertile portions
       of the country.<a id="footnotetag156"
       name="footnotetag156"></a><a href="#footnote156"><sup>156</sup></a>
       The primitive movements of population necessitated by
       climatic change, geological disturbances, the failure of
       water or exhaustion of the sources of food, were occasions
       for the expression of the superior motor disposition of the
       male and for the dislodgment of the female from her position
       of advantage.</p>

    <p>We know that the migrations of the natural races are
    necessary and frequent, and the movements of the culture races
    have been even more complex. The leadership of these
    mass-movements and spatial reaccommodations necessarily rests
    with the men, who, in their wanderings, have become acquainted
    with larger stretches of space; and whose specialty is motor
    co-ordination. The progressive races have managed the space
    problem best. At every favorable point they have pushed out
    their territorial boundaries or transferred their social
    activities to a region more favorable to their expansion. Under
    male <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
       id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span> leadership, in consequence,
       territory has always become the prize in every conflict of
       races; the modern state is based not on blood but on
       territory, and territory is at present the reigning
       political ideal.</p>

    <p>In the process of coming into control of a larger
    environment through the motor activities of the male, the group
    comes into collision with other groups within which the same
    movement is going on, and it then becomes a question which
    group can apply force more destructively and remove or bring
    under control this human portion of its environment. Military
    organization and battle afford the grand opportunity for the
    individual and mass expression of the superior force-capacity
    of the male. They also determine experimentally which groups
    and which individuals are superior in this respect, and
    despotism, caste, slavery, and the subjection of women are
    concrete expressions of the trial.</p>

    <p>The nominal headship of woman within the maternal group
    existed only in default of forms of activity fit to formulate
    headship among the men, and when chronic militancy developed an
    organization among the males, the political influence of the
    female was completely shattered. At a certain point in history
    women became an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"
       id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span> unfree class, precisely as
       slaves became an unfree class&mdash;because neither class
       showed a superior fitness on the motor side; and each class
       is regaining its freedom because the race is substituting
       other forms of decision for
       violence.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"

    <h2>SEX AND SOCIAL FEELING</h2>

    <p>An examination of the early habits of man and an analysis of
    the instincts which persist in him show that he has been
    essentially a predaceous animal, fighting his way up at every
    step of the struggle for existence. It therefore becomes a
    point of considerable interest to determine what influences
    have contributed to soften his behavior and make it possible
    for him to dwell in harmony and co-operation with large groups
    of his fellows.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>We, the lineal representatives of the successful
        enactors of one scene of slaughter after another, must,
        whatever more pacific virtues we may also possess, still
        carry about with us, ready to burst at any moment into
        flame, the smouldering and sinister traits of character by
        means of which they lived through so many massacres,
        harming others, but themselves unharmed.... If evolution
        and the survival of the fittest be true at all, the
        destruction of prey and of human rivals must have been
        among the most important of man's primitive functions, the
        fighting and the chasing instincts <i>must</i> have become
        ingrained. Certain perceptions <i>must</i> immediately, and
        without the intervention of inferences and ideas, have
        prompted emotions and motor discharges; and both the latter
        must, from the nature of the case, have been very violent,
        and therefore when unchecked of an intensely
        pleasurable</p>

        primitive part of us that it is so hard to eradicate,
        especially where a fight or a hunt is promised as a part of
        the fun.... No! those who try to account for this from
        above downwards, as if it resulted from the consequences of
        the victory being rapidly inferred, and from the agreeable
        sensations associated with them in the imagination, have
        missed the root of the matter. Our ferocity is blind and
        can only be explained from <i>below</i>. Could we trace it
        back through our lines of descent, we should see it taking
        more and more the form of a fatal reflex response, and at
        the same time becoming more and more the pure and direct
        emotion that it is.<a id="footnotetag157"

    </blockquote>

    <p>If we examine, in fact, our pleasures and pains, our moments
    of elation and depression, we find that they go back for the
    most part to instincts developed in the struggle for food and
    rivalry for mates. We can perhaps best get at the meaning of
    the conflict interest to the organism in terms of the
    significance to itself or the organism's own movements.
    Locomotion, of whatever type, is primarily to enable the animal
    to reach and grasp food, and also to escape other animals bent
    on finding food. The structure of the organism has been built
    up gradually through the survival of the most efficient
    structures. Corresponding with a structure mechanically adapted
    to successful movements, there is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"
       id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span> developed on the psychic side
       an interest in the conflict situation as complete and
       perfect as is the structure itself. The emotional states
       are, indeed, organic preparations for action, corresponding
       broadly with a tendency to advance or retreat, and a
       connection has even been made out between pleasurable states
       and the extensor muscles, and painful states and the flexor
       muscles. We can have no adequate idea of the time consumed
       and the experiments made in nature before the development of
       these types of structure and interest of the conflict
       pattern, but we know from the geological records that the
       time and experiments were long and many, and the competition
       so sharp, that finally, not in man alone, but in all the
       higher classes of animals, body and mind, structure and
       interest, were working perfectly in motor actions of the
       violent type involved in a life of conflict, competition,
       and rivalry. There could not have been developed an organism
       depending on offensive and defensive movements for food and
       life without an interest in what we call a dangerous or
       precarious situation. A type without this interest would
       have been defective, and would have dropped out in the
       course of development.</p>

    <p>There has been comparatively little change in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
       id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> human structure or human
       interest in historical times. It is a popular view that
       moral and cultural views and interests have superseded our
       animal instincts; but the cultural period is only a span in
       comparison with prehistoric times and the prehuman period of
       life, and it seems probable that types of psychic reaction
       were once for all developed and fixed; and while objects of
       attention and interest in different historical periods are
       different, we shall never get far away from the original
       types of stimulus and reaction. It is, indeed, a condition
       of normal life that we should not get too far away from
       them.</p>

    <p>The fact that our interests and enthusiasms are called out
    in situations of the conflict type is shown by a glance at the
    situations which arouse them most readily. War is simply an
    organized form of fight, and as such is most attractive, or, to
    say the least, arouses the interests powerfully. With the
    accumulation of property, and the growth of sensibility and
    intelligence, it becomes apparent that war is a wasteful and
    unsafe process, and public and personal interests lead us to
    avoid it as much as possible. But, however genuinely war may be
    deprecated, it is certainly an exciting game. The Rough Riders
    in this country recently, and more recently the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> young men of the
       aristocracy of England, went to war from motives of
       patriotism, no doubt; but there are unmistakable evidences
       that they also regarded it as the greatest sport they were
       likely to have a chance at in a lifetime. And there is
       evidence in plenty that the emotional attitude of women
       toward war is no less intense. Grey<a id="footnotetag158"
       name="footnotetag158"></a><a href="#footnote158"><sup>158</sup></a>
       relates that half a dozen old women among the Australians
       will drive the men to war with a neighboring tribe over a
       fancied injury. The Jewish maidens went out with music and
       dancing, and sang that Saul had slain his thousands, but
       David his ten thousands. Two American women who passed
       through the horrors of the siege of Pekin were, on their
       return, given a reception by their friends, and the daily
       press reported that they exhibited among other trophies "a
       Boxer's sword with the blood still on the blade, which was
       taken from the body of a Boxer killed by the legation
       guards; and a Boxer spear with which a native Christian girl
       was struck down in Legation Street." It is not necessary to
       regard as morbid or vulgar the action of these ladies in
       bringing home reminders of their peril. On the contrary, it
       is a sign of continued animal health and instinct in the
       race <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
       id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span> to feel deep interest in
       perilous situations and pleasure in their revival in
       consciousness.</p>

    <p>"Unaccommodated man" was, to begin with, in relations more
    hostile than friendly. The struggle for food was so serious a
    fact, and predaceousness to such a degree the habit of life,
    that a suspicious, hostile, and hateful state of mind was the
    rule, with exceptions only in the cases where truce,
    association, and alliance had come about in the course of
    experience. This was still the state of affairs in so advanced
    a stage of development as the Indian society of North America,
    where a tribe was in a state of war with every tribe with which
    it had not made a treaty of peace; and it is perhaps true,
    generally speaking, of men today, that they regard others with
    a degree of distrust and aversion until they have proved
    themselves good fellows. What, indeed, would be the fate of a
    man on the streets of a city if he did otherwise? There has,
    nevertheless, grown up an intimate relation between man and
    certain portions of his environment; and this includes, not
    only his wife and children, his dog and his blood-brother, but,
    with lessening intensity, the members of his clan, tribe, and
    nation. These become, psychologically speaking, a portion of
    himself, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"
       id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span> stand with him against the
       world at large. From the standpoint here outlined, prejudice
       or its analogue is the starting-point, and our question
       becomes one of the determination of the steps of the process
       by which man mentally allied with himself certain portions
       of his environment to the exclusion of others.</p>

    <p>If we look for an explanation of the hostility which a group
    feels for another group, and of the sympathy which its members
    feel for one another, we may first of all inquire whether there
    are any conditions arising in the course of the biological
    development of a species which, aside from social activities,
    lead to a predilection for those of one's own kind and a
    prejudice against different groups. And we do, in fact, find
    such conditions. The earliest movements of animal life involve,
    in the rejection of stimulations vitally bad, an attitude which
    is the analogue of prejudice. On the principle of chemiotaxis,
    the micro-organism will approach a particle of food placed in
    the water and shun a particle of poison; and its movements are
    similarly controlled by heat, light, electricity, and other
    tropic forces.<a id="footnotetag159"
       name="footnotetag159"></a><a href="#footnote159"><sup>159</sup></a>
       The development of animal life from
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
       id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span> this point upward consists
       in the growth of structure and organs of sense adapted to
       discriminate between different stimulations, to choose
       between the beneficial and prejudicial, and to obtain in
       this way a more complete control of the environment. Passing
       over the lower forms of animal life, we find in the human
       type the power of attention, memory, and comparison highly
       developed, so that an estimate is put on stimulations and
       situations correspondent with the bearing of stimulations or
       situations of this type on welfare in the past. The choice
       and rejection involved in this process are accompanied by
       organic changes (felt as emotions) designed to
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
       id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span> assist in the action which
       follows a decision.<a id="footnotetag160"
       name="footnotetag160"></a><a href="#footnote160"><sup>160</sup></a>
       Both the judgment and the emotions are thus involved in the
       presentation to the senses of a situation or object
       involving possible advantage or hurt, pleasure or pain. It
       consequently transpires that the feelings called out on the
       presentation of disagreeable objects and their contrary are
       very different, and there arise in this connection fixed
       mental attitudes corresponding with fixed or habitually
       recurrent external situations&mdash;hate and love, prejudice
       and predilection&mdash;answering to situations which revive
       feelings of pain on the one hand, and feelings of pleasure
       on the other. And such is the working of suggestion that,
       not alone an object or situation may produce a given state
       of feeling, but a voice, an odor, a color, or any
       characteristic sign of an object may produce the same effect
       as the object itself. The sight or smell of blood is an
       excitant to a bull, because it revives a conflict state of
       feeling, and even the color of a red rag produces a similar
       effect.</p>

    <p>When we come to examine in detail the process by which an
    associational and sympathetic relation
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> is set up between the
       individual and certain parts of the outside world to the
       exclusion of others, we find this at first, on a purely
       instinctive and reflex basis, originating in connection with
       food-getting and reproduction, and growing more conscious in
       the higher forms of life. One of the most important origins
       of association and prepossession is seen in the relation of
       parents, particularly of mothers, to children. This begins,
       of course, among the lower animals. The mammalian class, in
       particular, is distinguished by the strength and persistence
       of the devotion of parents to offspring. The advantage
       secured by the form of reproduction characteristic of man
       and the other mammals is that a closer connection is secured
       between the child and the mother. By the intra-uterine form
       of reproduction the association of mother and offspring is
       set up in an organic way before the birth of the latter, and
       is continued and put on a social basis during the period of
       lactation and the early helpless years of the child. By
       continuing the helpless period of the young for a period of
       years, nature has made provision on the time side for a
       complex physical and mental type, impossible in types thrown
       at birth on their own resources. Along with the structural
       modification <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span> of the female on account of
       the intra-uterine form of reproduction and the effort of
       nature to secure a more complex type and a better chance of
       survival, there is a corresponding development of the
       sentiments, and maternal feeling, in particular, is
       developed as the subjective condition necessary to carrying
       out the plan of giving the infant a prolonged period of
       helplessness and play through which its faculties are
       developed.<a id="footnotetag161"
       name="footnotetag161"></a><a href="#footnote161"><sup>161</sup></a>
       The scheme would not work if the mother were not more
       interested in the child than in anything else in the world.
       In the course of development every variational tendency in
       mothers to dote on their children was rewarded by the
       survival of these children, and the consequent survival of
       the stock, owing to better nutrition, protection, and
       training. Of course, this inherited interest in children is
       shared by the males of the group also, though not in the
       same degree, and there is reason to believe also that the
       interest of the male parent in children is acquired in a
       great degree indirectly and socially through his more potent
       desire to associate with the mother.</p>

    <p>This interest and providence on the score of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
       id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span> offspring has also a
       characteristic expression on the mental side. All
       sense-perceptions are colored and all judgments biased where
       the child is in question, and affection for it extends to
       the particular marks which distinguish it. Not only its
       physical features, but its dress and little shoes, its toys
       and everything it has touched take on a peculiar aspect.</p>

    <p>On the organic side, therefore, there is developed a
    tendency, both in connection with reactions to stimulations in
    general and in connection with reproductive life in particular,
    to seize on particular aspects and to be obsessed by them to
    the exclusion or disparagement of other aspects. The feelings
    of love and hate, and the broader feelings of race-prejudice
    and patriotism are consequently based first of all in the
    instincts.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the most particular and interesting expression of
    the general fact of susceptibility is seen in the sensitiveness
    of man to the opinion in which he is held by others. Social
    life in every stage of society is characterized by an eagerness
    to make a striking effect. A bare reference to the ethnological
    facts in this connection will suffice: The Kite Indians have a
    society of young men so brave and so ostentatious of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"
       id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span> their bravery that they
       will not fight from cover nor turn aside to avoid running
       into an ambuscade or a hole in the ice. The African has the
       privilege of cutting a gash six inches long in his thigh for
       every man he has killed. The Melanesian who is planning
       revenge sets up a stick or stone where it can be seen; he
       refuses to eat, and stays away from the dance; he sits
       silent in the council and answers questions by whistling and
       by other signs draws attention to himself and has it
       understood that he is a brave and dangerous man, and that he
       is biding his time.<a id="footnotetag162"
       name="footnotetag162"></a><a href="#footnote162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>

    <p>This bidding for the good opinion of others has plainly a
    connection with food-getting, and with the conflict side of
    life. High courage is praised and valued by society, and a man
    of courage is less imposed on by others, and comes in for
    substantial recognition and the favor of women. It is thus of
    advantage to act in such a way as to get public approval and
    some degree of appreciation; and a degree of sensibility on the
    score of the opinion of others, or at least a reckoning upon
    this, is involved in the process of personal adjustment.</p>

    <p>But the problem of personal adjustment at this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
       id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span> point would seem to call
       for more of intelligence than emotion; and we find, on the
       contrary, an excess of sensibility and a mania for being
       well thought of hardly to be explained as originating in the
       exigencies of tribal organization, nor yet on the score of
       its service to the individual in getting his food and living
       out his life. Why could not primitive man live in society,
       be of the war-parties, plan ambuscades, develop his fighting
       technique and gear, be a blood-brother to another man, show
       his trophies, set a high value on his personality, and
       insist on recognition and respect, without this almost
       pathological dependence on the praise and blame of
       others?</p>

    <p>Or if we approach the question from another standpoint and
    inspect our states of consciousness, we find signs that we have
    a greater fund of sensibility than is justified in immediate
    activity. We have the same mania to be well thought of; we are
    unduly interested when we hear that others have been talking
    about us; we are annoyed, even furious, at a slight criticism,
    and are childishly delighted by a compliment (without regard to
    our deserts); and children and adults alike understand how to
    put themselves forward and get notice, and equally well how to
    get notice by withdrawing themselves
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"
       id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span> and staying away or out of
       a game. We have a tendency to show off which is not
       apparently genetically connected with exploit or
       organization, and we recognize that this form of vanity is
       not consistent with the ordinary run of our activities when
       we argue with ourselves that the opinion of this or that
       person is of no consequence and attempt to think ourselves
       into a state of indifference. Intellectually and
       deliberately our attitude toward criticism from others would
       often be, if we could choose, represented by Tweed's query:
       "What are you going to do about it?" But actually it puts us
       to bed.</p>

    <p>All of this seems to indicate that there is an element in
    sensibility not accounted for on the exploit or food side, and
    this element is, I believe, genetically connected with sexual
    life. Unlike the struggle for existence in the ordinary sense
    of the phrase, the courtship of the sexes presents a situation
    in which an appeal is made for the favor of another
    personality, and the success of this appeal has a survival
    value&mdash;not for the individual, but for the species through
    the individual. We have, in fact, a situation in which the good
    opinion of another is vitally important. On this account the
    means of attracting and interesting others are definitely
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
       id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span> and bountifully developed
       among all the higher species of animals. Voice, plumage,
       color, odor, and movement are powerful excitants in wooing
       and aids both to the conquest of the female and the
       attraction of the male. In this connection we must also
       recognize the fact that reproductive life must be connected
       with violent stimulation, or it would be neglected and the
       species would become extinct; and, on the other hand, if the
       conquest of the female were too easy, sexual life would be
       in danger of becoming a play interest and a dissipation,
       destructive of energy and fatal to the species. Working, we
       may assume, by a process of selection and survival, nature
       has both secured and safeguarded reproduction. The female
       will not submit to seizure except in a high state of nervous
       excitation (as is seen especially well in the wooing of
       birds), while the male must conduct himself in such a way as
       to manipulate the female; and, as the more active agent, he
       develops a marvelous display of technique for this purpose.
       This is offset by the coyness and coquetry of the female, by
       which she equally attracts and fascinates the male and
       practices upon him to induce a corresponding state of
       nervous excitation.<a id="footnotetag163"
       name="footnotetag163"></a><a href="#footnote163"><sup>163</sup></a></p><span class="pagenum">
    <a name="page113"
       id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>

    <p>This is the only situation in the life of the lower animals,
    at any rate, where the choice of another is vitally important;
    and corresponding with the elaborate technique to secure this
    choice we have in wooing pleasure-pain reactions of a violent
    character. In a word, extreme sensitiveness to the judgment of
    another answers on the subjective side to technique for the
    conquest of a member of the opposite sex. It seems, therefore,
    that we are justified in concluding that our vanity and
    susceptibility have their origin largely in sexual life, and
    that, in particular, our susceptibility to the opinion of
    others and our dependence on their good will are genetically
    referable to sexual life.</p>

    <p>This view would be completely substantiated if we could show
    that the qualities of vanity and susceptibility in question are
    present in any species where it is impossible to assume that
    they were developed in connection with the struggle for food
    and as the result of the survival of types showing a tendency
    to combine and co-operate in the effort to get food. And we do,
    in fact, have cases of this kind among some of the lower
    animals. It cannot be said that the dog, for instance, has
    survived in the struggle for existence because of his
    sensitiveness to public <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"
       id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span> opinion in his species nor
       on account of an interest in being well thought of by the
       community of dogs at large which would lead him to behave in
       a public-spirited or moral manner. At the same time, the dog
       in his relation to man shows as keen a sensitiveness to
       man's opinion and treatment as does man himself. The
       attention which the master pays to one dog will almost break
       the heart of a dog not receiving it. A neglected dog plainly
       suffers as much in his way as the soldier who is sent to
       Coventry by his messmates; and if neglected and jealous dogs
       do not commit suicide, as they are reported to do, they are
       evidently in a state of mind to do so. This means that the
       dog has highly developed susceptibility to the appreciation
       of others, and that the species which he represents has had
       no history except a sexual history capable of developing
       this mental attitude. In connection with courtship he
       developed a fund of organic susceptibility, and this
       condition is involved in his more general relation to man;
       the machinery set up in sexual relations is played on by
       stimuli in general. A condition favorable to stimuli of a
       particular kind is favorable to stimuli in general; and it
       seems likely that this not very prominent fact of a state of
       excitation in a sexual
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"
       id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> connection is an important
       factor in the formation of the mind and of society.</p>

    <p>There are also certain conditions in the development of the
    individual and of society where the sexual type of reaction is
    so near the surface that it shows through in connection with
    political, moral, and other essentially non-sexual activities.
    Passing over the fact that the period of adolescence is
    noticeably a period of "susceptibility" and personal vanity, we
    may take as an example of the intrusion or persistence of the
    sexual element in conditions of a non-sexual kind the frequent
    association of sexual with religious
    excitement.<a id="footnotetag164"
       name="footnotetag164"></a><a href="#footnote164"><sup>164</sup></a>
       The appeal made during a religious revival to an unconverted
       person has psychologically some resemblance to the attempt
       of the male to overcome the hesitancy of the female. In each
       case the will has to be set aside, and strong suggestive
       means are used; and in both cases the appeal is not of the
       conflict type, but of an intimate, sympathetic, and pleading
       kind. In the effort to make a moral adjustment, it
       consequently turns out that a technique is used which was
       derived originally from sexual life,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
       id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span> and the use, so to speak,
       of the sexual machinery for a moral adjustment involves, in
       some cases, the carrying over into the general process of
       some sexual manifestations. The emotional forms used and the
       emotional states aroused are not entirely stripped of their
       sexual content.</p>

    <p>On the race side, also, there is a stage in development
    where the sexual pattern is transferred almost unmodified to
    public affairs. The following extracts from a lengthy
    description given by Mr. Bowdich of his reception by the king
    of Ashanti, in the year 1817, will illustrate sufficiently the
    employment of the turkey-cock pattern of activity in political
    relations:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The sun was reflected with a glare scarcely more
        supportable than the heat from massive gold ornaments which
        glistened in every direction. More than a hundred bands
        burst at once on our arrival, with the peculiar airs of
        their several chiefs; the horns flourished their defiances,
        with the beating of innumerable drums and metal
        instruments, and then yielded for a while to the soft
        breathings of their long flutes.... At least a hundred
        large umbrellas or canopies, which could shelter thirty
        persons, were sprung up and down by the bearers with
        brilliant effect, being made of scarlet, yellow, and the
        most showy cloths and silks, and crowned on the top with
        crescents, pelicans, elephants, barrels, and arms and
        swords of gold.... The caboceers, as did their superior
        captains, and attendants, wore Ashanti cloths of
        extravagant price, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"
           id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span> from the costly foreign
           silks which had been unravelled to weave them in all the
           varieties of color as well as pattern: they were of
           incredible size and weight, and thrown over the shoulder
           exactly like the Roman toga; a small silk fillet
           generally encircled their temples, and many gold
           necklaces, intricately wrought, suspended Moorish
           charms, dearly purchased, and enclosed in small square
           cases of gold, silver, and curious embroidery. Some wore
           necklaces reaching to the waist, entirely of aggry
           beads; a band of gold and beads encircled the knee, from
           which several strings of the same depended; small
           circlets of gold, like guineas, rings, and casts of
           animals were strung round their ankles; their sandals
           were of green, red and delicate white leather; manillas,
           and rude lumps of rock gold hung from their left wrists,
           which were so heavily laden as to be supported on the
           head of one of their handsomest boys.... [The king] wore
           a fillet of aggry beads round his temples, a necklace of
           gold cockspur shells strung by their larger ends, and
           over his right shoulder a red silk cord, suspending
           three sapphires cased in gold; his bracelets were of the
           richest mixtures of beads and gold, and his fingers
           covered with rings; his cloth was of a dark green silk,
           a pointed diadem was elegantly painted in white on his
           forehead; also a pattern resembling an epaulette on each
           shoulder, and an ornament like a full blown rose, one
           leaf rising above another until it covered his whole
           breast.... The belts of the guards behind his chair were
           cased in gold, and covered with small jaw-bones of the
           same metal; the elephants' tails, waving like a small
           cloud before him, were spangled with gold, and large
           plumes of feathers were flourished among them. His
           eunuch presided over these attendants,
           <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
           id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> wearing only one
           massive piece of gold about his neck; the royal stool,
           entirely cased in gold, was displayed under a splendid
           umbrella, with drums, sankos, horns, and various musical
           instruments, cased in gold, about the thickness of
           cartridge paper; large circles of gold hung by scarlet
           cloth from the swords of state;... hatchets of the same
           were intermixed with them; the breasts of the Ochras and
           various attendants were adorned with large stars,
           stools, crescents, and gossamer wings of solid
           gold.<a id="footnotetag165"
           name="footnotetag165"></a><a href="#footnote165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It is not surprising that the characteristically sexual
    method of display and emotional appeal should be associated
    with the earlier efforts at adjustment, both in the individual
    and in the state. This method is based on the instincts, and
    just as inhibition and brain legislation follow the instincts
    in point of development, a rational mode of control, individual
    and public, is developed later than the emotional form, or, at
    any rate, is not at first independent of it.</p>

    <p>The origin of mental impressionability seems to lie then,
    not in one, but in the two general regions of
    activity&mdash;that connected with the struggle for food and
    that connected with reproduction. The strain on the attention
    in the food and conflict side of life involves the development
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
       id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> of mental
       impressionability, particularly of an impressionability on
       the side of cognition. But in addition we have the
       impressionability growing out of sexual life which has been
       in question above, and which is more closely related to
       appreciation than to cognition. And of these two aspects of
       impressionability&mdash;the one growing out of conflict and
       the one growing out of reproduction&mdash;the latter has
       more social possibilities than the former, because it
       implies a sympathetic rather than an antagonistic organic
       attitude. It is certainly in virtue of susceptibility to the
       opinion of others that society works&mdash;through public
       opinion, fashion, tradition, reproof, encouragement,
       precept, and doctrine&mdash;to bring the individual under
       control and make him a member of society; and it is doubtful
       whether this could have been accomplished if a peculiar
       attitude of responsiveness to opinion had not arisen in
       sexual relations, reinforcing the more general and cognitive
       impressionability. Without this capacity to be influenced
       the individual would be in the condition of the hardened
       criminal, and society would be impossible.</p>

    <p>This sex-susceptibility, which was originally developed as
    an accessory of reproduction and had no social meaning
    whatever, has thus, in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> the struggle of society to
       obtain a hold on the individual, become a social factor of
       great importance, and together with another product of
       sexual life&mdash;the love of offspring&mdash;it is, I
       suspect, the most immediate source of our sympathetic
       attitudes in general, and an important force in the
       development of the ideal, moral, and aesthetic sides of
       life.</p>

    <p>Morality, sympathy, and altruism are of tribal origin, and
    have their roots in (1) the love of offspring, (2) the
    sensitivity connected with courtship, and (3) the comradeship
    which arises among men in prosecuting vital interests in
    common. The history of society on the moral and aesthetic sides
    is in great part the history of the attempt to make the
    sympathetic attitude prevail over the more antagonistic. But
    how far we are still short of this, and how far our sympathy
    and morality are still tribal and even familial, is indicated
    by the persistence of race-prejudice and of that</p>

    <h2>SEX AND PRIMITIVE INDUSTRY</h2>

    <p>Labor represents the expenditure of energy in securing food,
    and in making the food-process constant and sure; and we may
    well expect to find that the somatological differences shown to
    exist between man and woman will be found reflected in the
    labors of primitive society.</p>

    <p>An examination of the ethnological facts shows that among
    the primitive races men are engaged in activities requiring
    strength, violence, speed, and the craft and foresight which
    follow from the contacts and strains of their more motor life;
    and the slow, unspasmodic, routine, stationary occupations are
    the part of woman. Animal life is itself motor, elusive, and
    violent, and both by disposition and of necessity man's
    attention and activities are devoted first of all to the animal
    process. It is the most stimulating and dangerous portion of
    his environment, and affords the most immediate and concrete
    reward.</p>

    <p>Contrasted with this violent and intermittent activity of
    man, we find with equal uniformity that the attention of woman
    is directed principally to the vegetable environment. Man's
    attention to hunting and fighting, and woman's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
       id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span> attention to agriculture
       and attendant stationary industries, is so generally a
       practice of primitive society that we may well infer the
       habit is based on a physiological difference. An explanation
       of exceptions to the rule, and the departure from it in the
       later life of the race, we shall have to seek in changes in
       the social habits of the race.</p>

    <p>The old observation, that "woman was first a beast of
    burden, then a domestic animal, then a slave, then a servant,
    and last of all a minor," represents the usual view of the
    condition of woman taken by early missionaries and travelers.
    This view is, as we shall see, out of focus, but there is no
    doubt that the labors of early woman were exacting, incessant,
    varied, and hard, and that, if a catalogue of primitive forms
    of labor were made, woman would be found doing five things
    where man did one.</p>

    <p>An Australian of the Kurnai tribe once said to Fison: "A man
    hunts, spears fish, fights, and sits
    about;"<a id="footnotetag166"
       name="footnotetag166"></a><a href="#footnote166"><sup>166</sup></a>
       and this is a very good general statement of the male
       activities of primitive society the world over, if we add
       one other activity&mdash;the manufacture of weapons. On the
       other hand, Bonwick's statement of the labors of Tasmanian
       women is a typical
       one:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"
       id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>

    <blockquote>
        <p>In addition to the necessary duty of looking after the
        children, they had to provide all the food for the
        household excepting that derived from the chase of the
        kangaroo. They climbed up hills for the opossum, delved in
        the ground with their sticks for yams, native bread, and
        nutritive roots, groped about the rocks for shellfish,
        dived beneath the sea for oysters, and fished for the finny
        tribe. In addition to this, they carried, on their frequent
        tramps, the household stuff in native baskets of their own
        manufacture. Their affectionate partners would even pile
        upon their burdens sundry spears and waddies not required
        for present service, and would command their help to rear
        the breakwind, and to raise the fire. They acted, moreover,
        as cooks to the establishment, and were occasionally
        regaled, at the termination of a feast, with the leavings
        of their gorged masters.<a id="footnotetag167"
           name="footnotetag167"></a><a href="#footnote167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Among the Andamanese, while the men go into the jungle to
    hunt pigs, the women fetch drinking water and firewood, catch
    shellfish, make fishing nets and baskets, spin thread, and cook
    the food ready for the return of the men.<a id="footnotetag168"
       name="footnotetag168"></a><a href="#footnote168"><sup>168</sup></a>
       In New Caledonia "girls work in the plantations, boys learn
       to fight."<a id="footnotetag169"
       name="footnotetag169"></a><a href="#footnote169"><sup>169</sup></a>
       In Africa the case is similar. Among the Bushmen (to take
       only one example from this continent) the woman "weaves the
       frail mats and rushes under which
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"
       id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> her family finds a little
       shelter from the wind and from the heat of the sun,"
       constructs a fireplace of three round stones, fashions and
       bakes a few earthenware pots. When her household labors are
       done, she gathers roots, locusts, etc., from the fields. On
       the march she frequently carries a child, a mat, an earthen
       pot, some ostrich eggshells, and "a few ragged skins bundled
       on her head or shoulder," while the man carries only his
       spear, bow, and quiver.<a id="footnotetag170"
       name="footnotetag170"></a><a href="#footnote170"><sup>170</sup></a>
       The conditions among the American Indians were practically
       the same. Cotton Mather said of the Indians of
       Massachusetts: "The men are most abominably slothful, making
       their poor squaws or wives to plant, and dress, and barn,
       and beat their corn, and build their wigwams for
       them;"<a id="footnotetag171"
       name="footnotetag171"></a><a href="#footnote171"><sup>171</sup></a>
       and Jones, referring to the women of southern tribes,
       says:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Doomed to perpetual drudgery and to that subordinate
        position to which woman is always consigned where
        civilization and religion are not, she was little less than
        a beast of burden, busy with cooking, the manufacture of
        pottery, mats, baskets, moccasins, etc., a tiller of the
        ground, a nurse for her own children, and at all times a
        servant to the commands and passions of the stronger
        sex.<a id="footnotetag172"
           name="footnotetag172"></a><a href="#footnote172"><sup>172</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"
       id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span>

    <p>Primitive woman was therefore undoubtedly very busy, but I
    have seen no reason to believe that she considered her
    condition unfortunate. Our great-grandmothers were also very
    busy, but they were apparently not discontented. There was no
    reason why woman should not labor in primitive society. The
    forces which withdrew her from labor were expressions of later
    social conditions. Speaking largely, these considerations were
    the desire of men to preserve the beauty of women, and their
    desire to withdraw them from association with other men. It is
    the connection in thought and fact between idle and beautiful
    women and wealth, indeed, which has frequently led to the
    keeping of a superfluous number of such women as a sign of
    wealth.</p>

    <p>The exemption of women from labor, in short, implied an
    economic surplus which early society did not possess. The lower
    classes of modern society do not possess it either, and there
    the women are still "drudges," if we want to use that word
    about a situation which is normal, in view of the economic
    condition of the men and women concerned. It was necessary that
    primitive society, in the absence of elaborate machinery for
    doing things, in unstable and precarious
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"
       id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span> food conditions, and
       without resources accumulated from preceding generations,
       should utilize <i>all</i> its forces. The struggle for
       existence, in its harshest sense, was but little mitigated,
       and no group could have spared at all the industry of women.
       Even if primitive life had been as hard as Hobbes would have
       it, "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short," mere
       negative, habitual hardness and miserableness of condition
       did not get the attention of primitive society particularly.
       Their life was hard, as we look at it, not as they looked at
       it. They could not compare themselves with the future, and
       comparisons with the past were doubtless in their favor. The
       best returns from activity will of course follow when each
       individual is doing something he is specially well fitted to
       do, and natural selection seems to have seen to it that
       primitive society should so divide the labor as best to
       utilize social energy by assigning to men the tasks
       requiring violent exertion, and to women those requiring
       constant attention.</p>

    <p>But was not primitive man very lazy, and did he not do fewer
    things than he reasonably could have done? If we mean by lazy
    an aversion to certain types of action, primitive man was
    doubtless lazy; but if we mean an aversion to all kinds
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"
       id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span> of exertion, he certainly
       was not lazy. He was so thoroughly aroused by certain
       stimulations and so exhausted by the expenditure of energy
       in reacting to these stimulations that periods of
       recuperation, or "sitting about," were necessary.
       Heckenwelder's remarks on the labor of men and women among
       the Indians of Pennsylvania are very instructive, although
       they relate to tribes which had come under white influences
       to some extent:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The work of the women is not hard or difficult. They are
        both able and willing to do it, and always perform it with
        cheerfulness. Mothers teach their daughters those duties
        which common sense would otherwise point out to them when
        grown up. Within doors their labor is very trifling; there
        is seldom more than one pot or kettle to attend to. There
        is no scrubbing of the house, and but little to wash, and
        that not often. Their principal occupations are to cut and
        fetch in the firewood, till the ground, sow and reap the
        grain, and pound the corn in mortars for their pottage, and
        to make bread which they bake in the ashes. When going on a
        journey or to hunting camps with their husbands, if they
        have no horses, they carry a pack on their backs which
        often appears heavier than it really is; it generally
        consists of a blanket, a dressed deer skin for moccasins, a
        few articles of kitchen furniture, as a kettle, bowl, or
        dish, with spoons, and some bread, corn, salt, etc., for
        their nourishment. I have never known an Indian woman
        complain of the hardship of carrying this burden, which
        serves for their own comfort
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"
           id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span> and support as well as
           of their husbands. The tilling of the ground at home,
           getting of firewood, and pounding of corn in mortars, is
           frequently done by female parties, much in the manner of
           those husking, quilting, and other <i>frolics</i> (as
           they are called) in some parts of the United States....
           [When accompanying her husband on the hunt the woman]
           takes pains to dry as much meat as she can, that none
           may be lost; she carefully puts the tallow up, assists
           in drying the skins, gathers as much wild hemp as
           possible for the purpose of making strings, carrying
           bands, bags, and other necessary articles; collects
           roots for dyeing; in short, does everything in her power
           to leave no care to her husband but the important one of
           providing meat for the family. After all, the fatigue of
           the women is by no means to be compared to that of the
           men. Their hard and difficult employments are periodical
           and of short duration, while their husbands' labors are
           constant and severe in the extreme. Were a man to take
           upon himself a part of his wife's duty, in addition to
           his own, he must necessarily sink under the load, and of
           course his family must suffer with him. On his exertions
           as a hunter their existence depends; in order to be able
           to follow that rough employment with success, he must
           keep his limbs as supple as he can, he must avoid hard
           labor as much as possible, that his joints may not
           become stiffened, and that he may preserve the necessary
           strength and agility of body to enable him to pursue the
           chase, and bear the unavoidable hardships attendant on
           it; for the fatigues of hunting wear out the body and
           constitution far more than manual labor. Neither creeks
           nor rivers, whether shallow or deep, frozen or free from
           ice, must be an obstacle to the hunter
           <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"
           id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span> when in pursuit of a
           wounded deer, bear, or other animal, as is often the
           case. Nor has he then leisure to think on the state of
           his body, and to consider whether his blood is not too
           much heated to plunge without danger into the cold
           stream, since the game he is in pursuit of is running
           off from him with full speed. Many dangerous accidents
           often befall him both as a hunter and a warrior (for he
           is both), and are seldom unattended with painful
           consequences, such as rheumatism or consumption of the
           lungs, for which the sweat-house, on which they so much
           depend, and to which they often resort for relief,
           especially after a fatiguing hunt or warlike excursion,
           is not always a sure preservative or effectual
           remedy.<a id="footnotetag173"

    <p>The male and female come together by sexual attraction, and
    the chances of life are increased through association which
    permits each to do that class of things which by reason of its
    somatic habit it can do most effectively. Man's exploits were,
    however, of a more striking and sensational character, appealed
    to the emotions more, and secured the attention and the
    admiration of the public more, than the "drudgery" of the
    woman. The unusual esteem given by society to the destructive
    activities of the male can be very well understood in
    connection with a reference to the emotions. The emotions of
    anger, fear, and joy, to take only these examples, represent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
       id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> a physiological change in
       the organism in the presence of dangerous situations. Anger
       is a physiological preparation to resist, to crush a
       dangerous object; fear is an organic expression of
       inadequacy to avert the danger; and joy, in one of its
       aspects, is an organic revulsion answering to the
       recognition of the fact that the danger is safely passed.
       The same type of situation incessantly recurring in the life
       of the race, and constantly met by the same organic changes,
       has resulted in a fixed relation of certain types of
       situation to certain types of emotion.</p>

    <p>The forms of activity recognized first of all in the
    consciousness of the race as virtuous are simply those which
    successfully avert danger and secure safety. Courage,
    intrepidity, endurance, skill, sagacity, an indomitable spirit,
    and a willingness to die in fight, are virtues of the first
    importance, vitally indispensable to the society in conflict
    with man and beast, and they are virtues of which man is by his
    organic constitution, by the very fact of his capacity for the
    rapid destruction of energy, particularly capable. Man's
    exploits, therefore, first of all had social attention.</p>

    <p>The occupations of women were not of an emotional type, and,
    apart from sexual life, they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"
       id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span> got their excitements as
       spectators and approvers of the motor activities of the men.
       The Hebrew girls who went out with harps and timbrels to
       meet a victorious army, and sang that Saul had slain his
       thousands, but David his ten thousands, represent the
       relation between mighty deeds and social attention and
       approval. Thus the attention which the organism gives to
       situations of danger, through violent physiological
       readjustments fitted to meet the situation, has a parallel
       in the attention given by society to social means of meeting
       situations dangerous to the common life and welfare. We have
       a very plain continuance of the primitive appreciation of
       the virtues of violence in the worship of military men
       nowadays, and it is significant, also, that the appreciation
       of the fighting quality still reaches its most animated
       expression in women&mdash;the sex constitutionally most in
       need of social protection. It can hardly be denied,
       therefore, that man both enjoyed this exciting kind of
       performance more than the labors which women were connected
       with, and that the women justified him (if we assume that
       they passed any judgment on his conduct at all) in
       refraining from doing many things which he could have done
       perfectly well without constitutional
       hurt.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"
       id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>

    <p>The abundance of the labors of primitive woman seems to be
    accounted for further by the fact that a stationary life is the
    condition of a greater variety of industrial expressions than a
    life inclined to motor expressions. It is notorious that a
    wandering life is not favorable to the development of
    industries. Industries, in their very nature, handle and shape
    stationary stuffs, for the most part, and woman developed the
    constructive or industrial activities as a simple consequence
    of her more stationary condition of life. The formation of
    habit is largely a matter of attention, and the attention of
    woman being limited by her bodily habit and the presence of
    children to objects lying closer at hand, her energies found
    expression in connection with these objects.</p>

    <p>First of all, the house was identified with woman. The home
    was, in its simplest terms, the place where the wandering male
    rejoined the female. It was a cave, or a hollow tree, or a
    frail structure. It was sought or made with reference to safety
    and comfort, particularly with reference to the comfort of the
    young. Recognizing the greater interest of the woman in the
    child, it is evident that shelter was a more important
    consideration to her than to the man.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"
       id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span> The house is, indeed, a
       very fit accompaniment of the stationary habit of woman, and
       usually we find the most primitive tribes recognizing her
       greater interest in it. Even when the houses are built by
       men, they are generally owned by the women. Man as a
       solitary animal might, of course, make himself a shelter,
       but he had a particular interest in being about the shelter
       of woman, and it was under her shelter, after all, that
       children were born and that society accumulated numbers.
       This resulted in the maternal system and the recognition of
       woman as the head of the household, and the owner of the
       house. So, when the Indian squaw carries the wigwam on the
       march, she is carrying her private property and one of her
       own particular appurtenances. Contrary to the phrase which I
       quoted above, man is rather, in the sense in which I am now
       speaking, the domesticated animal. He has been inducted into
       the family. The estufas of the Pueblo Indians and the men's
       clubhouses in Africa represent the failure of men to
       assimilate completely in a society which was essentially
       female in its genius, and the club still stands for a
       difference in interest between the male and the female.</p>

    <p>From the house, or shelter, as a base, woman
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"
       id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span> got such connections with
       food as she might. For it is an error to suppose that she
       was in the most primitive times entirely dependent on man
       for food. She appears to have been quite as active in
       developing food surroundings in her way as man was in his.
       The plant world gave her the best returns for the effort
       which she could make. She beat out the seeds of plants,
       digged out the roots and tubers which the monkeys and pigs
       were seen to grub for most eagerly,<a id="footnotetag174"
       name="footnotetag174"></a><a href="#footnote174"><sup>174</sup></a>
       strained the poisonous juices from the cassava and made
       bread of the residue, and it was under her attention that a
       southern grass was developed into what we know as Indian
       corn. Looking back on this process, we call it the
       domestication of plants, and we are likely to regard it as a
       more conscious process than it really was. It was the result
       of her conversion to her own uses of the most available
       portion of her environment. In view of her physiological
       habit, the animal environment was, for the most part, out of
       the question, and her attention was of necessity directed to
       the plant side. While less remunerative in its beginnings
       than the animal side of the process, it was, perhaps, at all
       times less precarious and uncertain, and we find in
       consequence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"
       id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span> that the economic
       dependence of man on woman is as evident as her dependence
       on him. A dinner of herbs is a humbler resort than a roast
       of antelope, but there was less doubt that it would be
       forthcoming, and primitive man was often, when in hard luck,
       dependent on the activities of his wife, or the females of
       the group.</p>

    <p>The domestication of animals appears similarly to be the
    following-up by man of his connections with animal life, when
    this life began to be less abundant. It is probable that the
    practice originated in the habit of taking the young of animals
    home as pets, and there is apparently a point of difference
    between the attention of the men and the women given to animals
    once taken into the household. The men were interested in these
    animals as reviving in memory the emotional situations of
    hunting life, and also in the clever and inimitable accuracy of
    co-ordination and superhuman development of sense-perceptions,
    while there was always in the attitude of woman toward these
    animals a touch of maternal feeling, such as is still expended
    on the "harmless, necessary cat." And, in a small way, woman
    also contributed to the domestication of animals by giving them
    suck, partly as an economic
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"
       id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span> investment. In Tahiti and
       New Britain, for example, the women suckle the pigs, and the
       old women feed them.<a id="footnotetag175"
       name="footnotetag175"></a><a href="#footnote175"><sup>175</sup></a>
       Aside from this, the connections which primitive woman has
       with animal life is very slight. Worms and insects,
       shellfish, and even fish she may capture, but but after this
       her relation to animal life is in caring for the flesh and
       skins turned over to her by the man.</p>

    <p>It was a very general early practice that, when man had
    killed his game and brought it home, he was not concerned in
    the further handling of it. He did not, indeed, in all cases
    bring it home, but sent his wife after it. The Indians killed
    buffalo only as fast as the squaws could cut them up and care
    for the meat, and the men of the Eskimos would not draw the
    seal from the water after spearing it. Exhausted by
    extraordinary efforts, the man may well have left the dressing
    of the animal upon occasion to his wife, and, exhausted or not,
    he soon fell into the habit of doing so. It thus turns out that
    all labors relating to the preparation of food, and to the
    utilizations of the side-products of food stuffs, are apt to be
    found in the hands of the women.</p>

    <p>Vessels are necessary in cooking, both to carry
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"
       id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span> and hold water, and to
       store the surplus of food, both vegetable and animal, and
       the woman, feeling the need of these in connection with what
       she has set about doing, weaves baskets and makes pottery.
       Fetching wood, grinding corn, tanning the hides, and in the
       main the preparation of clothing, follow rather necessarily
       from her relation to the raw products. Spinning and weaving
       and dyeing are related closely to the vegetable world to
       begin with, and it is to be expected that they would be
       developed by the women. But man is very deeply interested in
       clothing on the ornamental side, and the farther back we go
       in society, the more this holds, and sometimes, particularly
       in Africa, since the domestication of oxen there, the men
       prepare the leather and do the sewing, even for the women.
       There is, indeed, nothing in the nature of sewing to make it
       a woman's occupation. It involves a relation of the hand to
       the eye&mdash;similar to that which the man is always
       practicing and using, i.e., reaching a given point, perhaps
       with mechanical aids, through the mediation of these two
       organs. It is a motor matter, therefore, and one of the
       first industries undertaken by men. There are many
       exceptions to the general statement that early manufacture
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"
       id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span> (weapons excepted) was in
       the hands of women, but the exceptions may be regarded as
       variations due to the fixation of habit through single and
       peculiar incidents, or they are the beginning of the later
       period when man begins to practice woman's activities.</p>

    <p>The primitive division of labor among the sexes was not in
    any sense an arrangement dictated by the men, but a habit into
    which both men and women fell, to begin with, through their
    difference of organization&mdash;a socially useful habit whose
    rightness no one questioned and whose origin no one thought of
    looking into. There is, moreover, a tendency in habits to
    become more fixed than is inherently necessary. The man who
    does any woman's work is held in contempt not only by men, but
    by women.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>As to the Indian women, they are far from complaining of
        their lot. On the contrary, they would despise their
        husbands could they stoop to any menial office, and would
        think it conveyed an imputation upon their own conduct. It
        is the worst insult one virago can cast upon another in a
        moment of altercation. "Infamous woman," will she cry, "I
        have seen your husband carrying wood into the lodge to make
        the fire. Where was his squaw, that he should be obliged to
        make a woman of himself!"<a id="footnotetag176"

       id="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span> women's taking up male
       occupations we know from modern industrial history, without
       looking to ethnological evidence. Habit was, however, in
       another regard favorable to woman, since what she was
       constantly associated with and expended her activities upon
       was looked upon as hers. Through her identification with the
       industrial process she became, in fact, a property-owner.
       This result did not spring from the maternal system; but
       both this and the maternal system were the results of her

        <p>A plurality of wives is required by a good hunter, since

    <p>The outcome of this closer attention of the woman to the
    industrial life is well seen among the ancient Hebrews:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>A virtuous woman ... seeketh wool and flax, and worketh
        willingly with her hands. She is like the merchant ships:
        she bringeth her food from afar. She riseth also while it
        is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and their
        task to her maidens. She considereth a field and buyeth it;
        with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.... She
        perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable: her lamp
        goeth not out by night. She layeth her hands to the
        distaff, and her hands hold the spindle. She spreadeth out
        her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to
        the needy. She is not afraid of the snow for her household;
        for all her household are clothed with scarlet. She maketh
        for herself carpets of tapestry; her clothing is fine linen
        and purple. Her husband is known in the gates, when linen
        garments and selleth them; and delivereth girdles unto the
        merchant.<a id="footnotetag183"

    <p>There must come a time in the history of every group when
    wild game becomes scarce. This time is put off by successive
    migrations to wilder regions; but the rapid increase of
    population makes any continent inadequate to the supply of food
    through the chase indefinitely. Morgan estimates that the state
    of New York, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"
       id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span> with its 47,000 square
       miles, never contained at any one time more than 25,000
       Indians.<a id="footnotetag184"
       name="footnotetag184"></a><a href="#footnote184"><sup>184</sup></a>
       Sooner or later the man must either fall back on the process
       represented by the women, taking up and developing her
       industries, or he must change his attitude toward animal
       life. In fact, he generally does both. He enters into a sort
       of alliance with animal life, or with certain of its forms,
       feeding them, and tending them, and breeding them; and he
       applies his katabolic energies to the pursuits of woman,
       organizing and advancing them. Whether the animal or the
       plant life receives in the end more attention is a matter
       turning on environment and other circumstances.</p>

    <p>When the destructive male propensities have exhausted or
    diminished the food stores on the animal side, and man is
    forced to fall back on the constructive female process, we find
    that he brings greater and better organizing force to bear on
    the industries. Male enterprises have demanded concerted
    action. In order to surround a buffalo herd, or to make a
    successful assault, or even to row a large boat, organization
    and leadership are necessary. To attack under leaders, give
    signal cries, station sentinels, punish offenders,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"
       id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span> is, indeed, a part of the
       discipline even of animal groups. The organizing capacity
       developed by the male in human society in connection with
       violent ways of life is transferred to labor. The
       preparation of land for agriculture was undertaken by the
       men on a large scale. The jungle was cleared, water courses
       were diverted and highways prepared for the transportation
       of the products of labor.</p>

    <p>But more than this, perhaps, man brought with him to the
    industrial occupations all the skill in fashioning
    force-appliances acquired through his intense, constant, and
    long-continued attention to the devising and manufacture of
    weapons. Man is relatively a feeble animal, but he made various
    and ingenious cutting, jabbing, and bruising appliances to
    compensate. His life was a life of strains, both giving and
    taking, and under the stress he had developed offensive and
    defensive weapons. There is, however, no radical difference,
    simply a difference in object and intensity of stimulus,
    between handling and making weapons and handling and making
    tools. So, when man was obliged to turn his attention to the
    agriculture and industries practiced by primitive woman he
    brought all his technological skill and a part
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"
       id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span> of his technological
       interest to bear on the new problems. Women had been able to
       thrust a stick into the earth and drop the seed and await a
       meager harvest. When man turned his attention to this
       matter, his ingenuity eventually worked out a remarkable
       combination of the animal, mineral, and vegetable kingdoms:
       with the iron plow, drawn by the ox, he upturned the face of
       the earth, and produced food stuffs in excess of immediate
       demands, thus creating the conditions of culture.</p>

    <p>The destructive habits of the male nature were thus
    converted under the stress of diminishing nutrition to the
    habits represented primarily by the constructive female nature,
    and the inventive faculty developed through attention to
    destructive mechanical aids was now applied equally to the
    invention of constructive mechanical
    aids.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"
       id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span>

    <h2>SEX AND PRIMITIVE MORALITY</h2>

    <p>The function of morality is to regulate the activities of
    associated life so that all may have what we call fair play. It
    is impossible to think of morality aside from expressions of
    force, primarily physical force. "Thou shalt not kill; thou
    shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt
    not commit adultery; thou shalt not remove the ancient
    landmark;" and all approvals and disapprovals imply that the
    act in question has affected or will affect the interest of
    others, or of society at large, for better or for worse. And
    since morality goes back so directly to forms of activity and
    their regulation, we may expect to find that the motor male and
    the more stationary female have had a different relation to the
    development of a moral code.</p>

    <p>As between nutrition and reproduction, in the struggle for
    life, nutrition plays a larger rôle&mdash;in volume, at any
    rate&mdash;in the life-history of the individual. A
    consideration of the causes of the modification of species in
    nature shows that the changes in morphology and habit of the
    animal which relate to food-getting are more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"
       id="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span> fundamental and numerous
       than those which relate to wooing. In a moral code,
       likewise, whether in an animal or human society, the bulk of
       morality turns upon food rather than sex relations; and
       since the male is more active in both these relations, and
       since, further, morality is the mode of regulating
       activities in these relations, it is to be expected that
       morality, and immorality as well, will be found primarily to
       a greater degree functions of the motor male
       disposition.</p>

    <p>Tribal safety and the preservation and extension of the
    territory furnishing food demand the organized attention of the
    group first of all; and the emotional demonstrations and social
    rewards following modes of behavior which have a protective or
    provident meaning for the group, and the public disapproval and
    disallowance of modes of behavior which impair the safety or
    force capacity, and consequent satisfactions of the group,
    become in the tribe the most powerful of all stimuli, and
    stimuli to which the male is peculiarly able to react. This is
    not like the case of hunger and other physiological stimuli
    which are conditioned from within. The individual acts for the
    advantage of the group rather than for his personal advantage,
    and the stimulus <span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"
       id="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span> to this action must be
       furnished socially. Group preservation being of first-rate
       importance, no group would survive in which the public
       showed apathy on this point. Lewis and Clarke say of the
       Dakota Indians:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>What struck us most was an institution peculiar to them
        and to the Kite Indians, further to the westward, from whom
        it is said to have been copied. It is an association of the
        most active and brave young men, who are bound to each
        other by attachment, secured by a vow never to retreat
        before any danger, or to give way to their enemies. In war
        they go forward without sheltering themselves behind trees,
        or aiding their natural valor by any artifice.... These
        young men sit, and encamp, and dance together, distinct
        from the rest of the nation; they are generally about
        thirty or thirty-five years old; and such is the deference
        paid to courage that their seats in the council are
        superior to those of the chiefs, and their persons more
        respected.<a id="footnotetag185"
           name="footnotetag185"></a><a href="#footnote185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The consciousness of the value of male activity is here
    expressed in an exaggerated degree&mdash;in a degree bordering
    upon the pathological, since the reckless exposure of life to
    danger is not necessary to success at a given moment, and is
    unjustifiable from the standpoint of public safety, unless it
    be on the side of the suggestive effect of intrepid conduct in
    creating a general <span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"
       id="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span> standard of intrepidity.
       Similarly, the Indians in general often failed to get the
       full benefit of a victory, because of their practice that
       the scalp of an enemy belonged to him who took it, and their
       pursuits after a rout were checked by the delay of each to
       scalp his own.</p>

    <p>The pedagogical attempts of primitive society, so far as
    they are applied to boys, have as an end the encouragement of
    morality of a motor, not a sentimental, type. The boys are
    taught war and the chase, and to despise the occupations of
    women. Thompson says of the Zulu boys:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>It is a melancholy fact that when they have arrived at a
        very early age, should their mothers attempt to chastise
        them, such is the law that these lads are at the moment
        allowed to kill their mothers.<a id="footnotetag186"
           name="footnotetag186"></a><a href="#footnote186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Ethnologists often make mention of the fact that the natural
    races do not generally punish children; and while this is due
    in part to a less definite sense of responsibility, as well as
    of less nervousness in parents, non-interference is a part of
    their system of training:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Instead of teaching the boy civil manners, the father
        desires him to beat and pelt the strangers who come to the
        tent; to steal or secrete in joke some trifling article
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"
           id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span> belonging to them; and
           the more saucy and impudent they are, the more
           troublesome to strangers and all the men of the
           encampment, the more they are praised as giving
           indication of a future enterprising and warlike
           disposition.<a id="footnotetag187"
           name="footnotetag187"></a><a href="#footnote187"><sup>187</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Theft is also encouraged among boys as a developer of their
    wits. The Spartan boy and the fox is a classical example; and
    Diodorus relates that in Egypt the boy who wished to become a
    thief was required to enrol his name with the captain of the
    thieves, and to turn over to him all stolen articles. The
    citizens who were robbed went to the captain of thieves and
    recovered their property upon payment of one-fourth of its
    value.<a id="footnotetag188"
       name="footnotetag188"></a><a href="#footnote188"><sup>188</sup></a>
       Admiration of a lawless deed often foreruns censure of the
       deed in consciousness today: there are few men who do not
       admire a particularly daring and successful bank or diamond
       robbery, though they deprecate the social injury done.</p>

    <p>Formally becoming a man is made so much of in early society,
    because it is on this occasion that fitness for activity is put
    to the test. Initiatory ceremonies fall at the time of puberty
    in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"
       id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span> candidate, and consist of
       instruction and trials of fortitude. A certain show of the
       proceeds of activity is also exacted of young men,
       especially in connection with marriage, and the youth is not
       permitted to marry until he has killed certain animals or
       acquired certain trophies. The attention given to manly
       practices in connection with marriage is seen in this
       example from the Kukis:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>When a young man has fixed his affections upon a young
        woman, either of his own or some neighboring <i>Parah</i>,
        his father visits her father and demands her in marriage
        for his son: her father, on this, inquires what are the
        merits of the young man to entitle him to her favor; and
        how many can he afford to entertain at the wedding feast;
        to which the father of the young man replies that his son
        is a brave warrior, a good hunter, and an expert thief; for
        that he can produce so many heads of the enemies he has
        slain and of the game he has killed; that in his house are
        such and such stolen goods; and that he can feast so many
        (mentioning the number) at his
        marriage.<a id="footnotetag189"
           name="footnotetag189"></a><a href="#footnote189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Occasionally the ability to take punishment is even made a
    part of the marriage ceremony. At Arab marriages</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>there is much feasting, and the unfortunate bridegroom
        undergoes the ordeal of whipping by the relations of his
        bride, in order to test his courage. Sometimes this
        punishment <span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"
           id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span> is exceedingly severe,
           being inflicted with the coorbatch, or whip of
           hippopotamus hide, which is cracked vigorously about his
           ribs and back. If the happy husband wishes to be
           considered a man worth having, he must receive the
           chastisement with an expression of enjoyment; in which
           case the crowds of women in admiration again raise their
           thrilling cry.<a id="footnotetag190"
           name="footnotetag190"></a><a href="#footnote190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A very simple record of successful activity is the bones of
    animals. McCosh says of the Mishmis of India:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Nor are these hospitable rites allowed to be forgotten;
        the skull of every animal that has graced the board is hung
        up as a record in the hall of the entertainer; he who has
        the best-stocked Golgotha is looked upon as the man of the
        greatest wealth and liberality, and when he dies the whole
        smoke-dried collection of many years is piled upon his
        grave as a monument of his riches and a memorial of his
        worth.<a id="footnotetag191"
           name="footnotetag191"></a><a href="#footnote191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And Grange of the Nagas:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>In front of the houses of the greater folks are strung
        up the bones of the animals with which they have feasted
        the villagers, whether tigers, elephants, cows, hogs, or
        monkeys, or aught else, for it signifies little what comes
        to their net.<a id="footnotetag192"
           name="footnotetag192"></a><a href="#footnote192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The head-hunting mania of Borneo is also a pathological
    expression of the desire to get
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"
       id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span> approval of destructive
       activity from both the living and the dead:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The aged of the people were no longer safe among their
        kindred, and corpses were secretly disinterred to increase
        the grizzly store. Superstition soon added its ready
        impulse to the general movement. The aged warrior could not
        rest in his grave till his relatives had taken a head in
        his name; the maiden disdained the weak-hearted suitor
        whose hand was not yet stained with some cowardly
        murder.<a id="footnotetag193"
           name="footnotetag193"></a><a href="#footnote193"><sup>193</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Class distinctions and the attendant ceremonial observances
    go immediately back to an appreciation of successful motor
    activities. We need only observe the conduct of weaker animals
    in the presence of the stronger to appreciate the differences
    in behavior induced by the presence of superior motor ability.
    The recognition of this difference, as it is finally expressed
    in habitual forms of behavior, becomes a symbol of the
    difference, while the difference goes back, in reality, to a
    difference in capacity. This example from Raffles illustrates
    the intensity of moral meaning which the appreciation of
    achievement may take on in the end:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>At the court of <i>Súra-kérta</i> I recollect that once,
        when holding a private conference with the <i>Súsunan</i>
        at the residency, it became necessary for the <i>Rádan
        adipáti</i> to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"
           id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span> be dispatched to the
           palace for the royal seal: the poor old man was, as
           usual, squatting, and as the Susunan happened to be
           seated with his face toward the door, it was fully ten
           minutes before his minister, after repeated ineffectual
           attempts, could obtain the opportunity of rising
           sufficiently to reach the latch without being seen by
           his royal master. The mission on which he was dispatched
           was urgent, and the Susunan himself inconvenienced by
           the delay; but these inconveniences were insignificant
           compared with the indecorum of being seen out of the
           <i>dódok</i> posture. When it is necessary for an
           inferior to move, he must still retain that position,
           and walk with his hams upon his heels until he is out of
           his superior's sight.<a id="footnotetag194"
           name="footnotetag194"></a><a href="#footnote194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>

    <p>Drury says that a Malagasy chief, on his return from
    war,</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>had scarcely seated himself at his door, when his wife
        came out crawling on her hands and knees until she came to

        mother did the same, and all the women in the town saluted
        their husbands in the same manner.<a id="footnotetag195"

    <p>An examination of the causes of the approval of conduct in
    early times thus discloses that approvals were based to a large
    degree on violent and socially advantageous conduct, that the
    training and rewards of early society were calculated to
    develop the skill and fortitude essential
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"
       id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span> to such conduct, and that
       the men were particularly the representatives of conduct of
       this type. In the past, at any rate, there has been no glory
       like military glory, and no adulation like military
       adulation; and in the vulgar estimation still no quality in
       the individual ranks with the fighting
       quality.<a id="footnotetag196"
       name="footnotetag196"></a><a href="#footnote196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>

    <p>But checks upon conduct are even more definitely expressed,
    and more definitely expressible, than approvals of conduct.
    Approval is expressed in a more general expansive feeling
    toward the deserving individual, and this may be accompanied
    with medals for bravery, promotions, and other rewards; but in
    general the moral side of life gets no such definite notice as
    the immoral side. Practices which are disliked by all may be
    forbidden, while there is no equally summary way of dealing
    with practices approved by all. In consequence, practices which
    interfere with the activities of others are inhibited,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"
       id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span> and to the violation of the
       inhibition is attached a penalty, resulting in a body of law
       and a system of punishment. An analysis of the following
       crimes and punishments among the Kafirs, for instance,
       indicates that a definite relation between offensive forms
       of activity and punishments is present at a comparatively
       early period of development:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Theft: restitution and fine. Injuring cattle: death or
        fine, according to the circumstances. Causing cattle to
        abort: heavy fine. Arson: fine. False witness: heavy fine.
        Maiming: fine. Adultery: fine, sometimes death. Rape: fine,
        sometimes death. Using love philters: death or fine,
        according to circumstances. Poisoning, and practices with
        an evil intent (termed "witchcraft"): death and
        confiscation. Murder: death or fine, according to
        circumstances.... Treason, as contriving the death of a
        chief, conveying information to the enemy: death and

    <p>As the vigorous and aggressive activities of the male have a
    very conspicuous value for the group when exercised for the
    benefit of the group, they become particularly harmful when
    directed against the safety or interests of the group or the
    members of the group, and we find that civil and criminal law,
    and contract, and also conventional morality, are closely
    connected with the motility of the male. The establishment of
    moral standards is mediated through the sense of
    strain&mdash;strain to the personal self, and strain to the
    social self. Whether a man is injured by an assault upon his
    life or upon his property, he suffers violence, and the first
    resort of the injured individual or group is to similar
    violence; but this results in a vicious tit-for-tat reaction
    whereby the stimulus to violence is reinstated by every fresh
    act of violence. Within the group this vicious action and
    reaction is broken up by the intervention of public opinion,
    either in an informal expression of disapproval, or through the
    headmen. The man who continues to kill may be killed in turn,
    but by order of the council of the tribe; and one of his
    kinsmen may be appointed to execute him, as under that
    condition no feud can follow. But there is always a reluctance
    to banish or take the life of the member
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"
       id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span> of the group, both because
       no definite machinery is developed for accomplishing either,
       and because the loss of an able-bodied member of a group is
       a loss to the group itself. The group does not seek,
       therefore, immediately to be rid of an offensive member, but
       to modify his habits, to convert him. Jones says of the
       Ojibways that there were occasionally bad ones among them,
       "but the good council of the wise sachems and the mark of
       disgrace put upon unruly persons had a very desirable
       influence."<a id="footnotetag199"

       The extreme form of punishment in the power of the folk-moot

       cursed.<a id="footnotetag200"

       Sending a man to Coventry is in vogue among the Fejir
       Beduins: one who kills a friend is so despised that he is

       member of the tribe.<a id="footnotetag201"
       name="footnotetag201"></a><a href="#footnote201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>

    <p>The formulation of sentiment about an act depends also on
    the repetition of the act. The act is more irritating, and the
    irritation more widespread, with each repetition, and there
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"
       id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span> is an increase of the
       penalty for a second offense, and death for a slight offense
       when frequently repeated: in the Netherlands stealing of
       linen left in the fields to be bleached led to the death
       penalty for stealing a pocket handkerchief. And with
       increasing definiteness of authority there follows
       increasing definiteness of punishment; and when finally the
       habit becomes fixed, conformity with it becomes a paramount
       consideration, and a deed is no longer viewed with reference
       to its intrinsic import so much as to its conformity or
       nonconformity with a standard in the law: <i>summum jus,
       summa injuria</i>.</p>

    <p>Morality, involving the modification of the conduct of the
    individual in view of the presence of others, is already highly
    developed in the tribal stage, since the exigencies of life
    have demanded the most rigorous regulation of behavior in order
    to secure the organization and the prowess essential to success
    against all comers. But the tribe is a unit in hostile
    coexistence with other similar units, and its morality stops
    within itself, and applies in no sense to strangers and
    outsiders. The North American Indians were theoretically at war
    with all with whom they had not concluded a treaty of peace. In
    Africa the traveler <span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"
       id="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span> is safe and at an advantage
       if by a fiction (the rite of blood-brotherhood) he is made a
       member of the group; and similarly in Arabia and elsewhere.
       The old epics and histories are full of the praises of the
       man who is gentle within the group and furious without it.
       The earliest commandments doubtless did not originally apply
       to mankind at large. They meant, "Thou shalt not kill within
       the tribe," "Thou shalt not commit adultery within the
       tribe," etc. Cannibalism furnishes a most interesting
       example of the prohibition of a practice as applied to the
       members of the group, while extra-tribal cannibalism
       continued unabated. And within the tribe there is a
       continuance of this practice in the forms which do not
       interfere with the efficiency and cripple the activity of
       the group. That is, while cannibalism in general is
       prohibited, the eating of the decrepit, the aged, of
       invalids, of deformed children, and of malefactors is still
       practiced.<a id="footnotetag202"
       name="footnotetag202"></a><a href="#footnote202"><sup>202</sup></a></p>

    <p>But there gradually grew up a set of disapprovals of conduct
    as such, whether within or without the group. In the
    <i>Odyssey</i> Pallas Athene says that Odysseus had come from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"
       id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span> Ephyra from Ilus, son of
       Mermerus: "For even thither had Odysseus gone on his swift
       ship to seek a deadly drug, that he might have wherewithal
       to smear his bronze-shod arrows: but Ilus would in no wise
       give it to him, for he had in awe the everlasting
       gods."<a id="footnotetag203"
       name="footnotetag203"></a><a href="#footnote203"><sup>203</sup></a>
       Here is an extension to society in general of a principle
       which had been first worked out in the group; for poisoning
       without the group was long allowed after it was disallowed
       in the group. The case of poisoning is, indeed, a
       particularly good instance of an unsatisfaction felt in the
       substitution of clandestine methods for simple motor force
       in deciding a dispute, and affords a clear example of an
       important relation between moral feeling and physiological
       functioning. Animal as well as human society has developed
       strategy alongside of direct motor expressions, but strategy
       is only an indirect application of the motor principle.
       Co-ordination, associative memory, will, judgment, are
       involved in strategy; it is only a different mode of
       functioning. On the other hand, there is a peculiar
       abhorrence of murder by night, poisoning, drowning in a
       ship's hold, because, while all the physiological machinery
       for action is on hand, there is no chance to work
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"
       id="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span> it. It is a most
       exasperating thing to die without making a fight for it. The
       so-called American duel is an abhorrent thing, because life
       or death is decided by a turn of the dice, not on the
       racially developed principle of the battle to the
       strong.</p>

    <p>When, then, it is observed within the group that this, that,
    and the other man has died of poison, each interprets this in
    terms of himself, and no one feels safe. The use of poison is
    not only a means of checking activities and doing hurt
    socially, but this form is most foul and unnatural because it
    involves a death without the possibility of motor resistance
    (except the inadequate opportunity on the strategic side of
    taking precautionary measures against poison) and a victory and
    social reward without a struggle. The group, therefore, early
    adopts very severe methods in this regard. Death is the usual
    penalty for the use of poison, and even the possession of
    poison, among tribes not employing it for poisoning weapons, is
    punished. Among the Karens of India, if a man is found with
    poison in his possession, he is bound and placed for three days
    in the hot sun, his poison is destroyed, and he is pledged not
    to obtain any more. If he is suspected of killing anyone, he is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"
       id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span>
       executed.<a id="footnotetag204"
       name="footnotetag204"></a><a href="#footnote204"><sup>204</sup></a>
       Particularly distressing modes of death, and other means of
       penalizing death by poison more severely than motor modes of
       killing, were adopted. The Chinese punish the preparation of
       poisons or capture of poisonous animals with beheading,
       confiscation, and banishment of wife and children. In Athens
       insanity caused by poison was punished with death. The
       <i>Sachsenspiegel</i> provides death by fire. In the lawbook
       of the tsar Wachtang a double composition price was exacted
       for death by poison. And in ancient Wales death and
       confiscation were the penalty for death by poison, and death
       or banishment the penalty of the manufacturer of poisons.
       The same quality of disapproval is expressed in early law of
       sorcery, and it is unnecessary to give details of this also.
       But, stated in emotional terms, both poison and sorcery, and
       other underhand practices arouse one of the most distressing
       of the emotions&mdash;the emotion of dread, if we understand
       by this term that form of fear which has no tangible or
       visible embodiment, which is apprehended but not located,
       and which in consequence cannot be resisted; the distress,
       in fact, lying in the inability
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"
       id="page167"></a>[pg 167]</span> to function. The organism
       which has developed structure and function through action is
       unsatisfied by an un-motor mode of decision. We thus detect
       in the love of fair play, in the Golden Rule, and in all
       moral practices a motor element; and with changing
       conditions there is progressively a tendency, mediated by
       natural selection and conscious choice, to select those
       modes of reaction in which the element of chance is as far
       as possible eliminated. This preference for functional over
       chance or quasi-chance forms of decision is expressed first
       within the group, but is slowly extended, along with
       increasing commercial communication, treaties of peace, and
       with supernatural assistance, to neighboring groups. The
       case of Odysseus is an instance of a moment in the life of
       the race when a disapproval is becoming of general
       application.</p>

    <p>On our assumption that morality is dependent on strains, and
    that its development is due to the advantage of regulating
    these strains, we may readily understand why most of the canons
    of morality are functions of the katabolic male activity.
    Theft, arson, rape, murder, burglary, highway robbery, treason,
    and the like, are natural accompaniments of the more aggressive
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"
       id="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span> male disposition; the male
       is <i>par excellence</i> both the hero and the criminal. But
       on the side of the sex we might expect to find the female
       disposition setting the standards of morality, since
       reproduction is even a greater part of her nature than of
       man's. On the contrary, however, we find the male standpoint
       carried over and applied to the reproductive process, and
       the regulation of sex practices transpiring on the basis of
       force. In the earliest period of society, under the maternal
       system, the woman had her own will more with her person; but
       with the formulation of a system of control, based on male
       activities, the person of woman was made a point in the
       application of the male standpoint. "The wife, like any
       other of the husband's goods and chattels, might be sold or
       lent."<a id="footnotetag205"
       name="footnotetag205"></a><a href="#footnote205"><sup>205</sup></a>

       Forsyth reports of the Gonds that</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>infidelity in the married state is ... said to be very
        rare; and, when it does occur, is one of the few occasions
        when the stolid aborigine is roused to the extremity of
        passion, frequently revenging himself on the guilty pair
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"
           id="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span> by cutting off his

    <p>The sacrifice of wives in Africa, India, Fiji, Madagascar,
    and elsewhere, upon the death of husbands, shows how completely
    the person of the female had been made a part of the male
    activity. Where this practice obtained, the failure of the
    widow to acquiesce in the habit was highly immoral. Williams
    says of the strangling of widows by the Fijians:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>It has been said that most of the women thus destroyed
        are sacrificed at their own instance. There is truth in
        this statement, but unless other facts are taken into
        account it produces an untruthful impression. Many are
        importunate to be killed, because they know that life would
        henceforth be to them prolonged insult, neglect, and
        want.... If the friends of the woman are not the most
        clamorous for her death, their indifference is construed
        into disrespect either for her late husband or his
        friends.<a id="footnotetag208"

    </blockquote>

    <p>Child-marriages are another instance of the success of the
    male in gaining control of the person of the female and of
    regulating her conduct from his own standpoint. Girls were
    married or betrothed before birth, at birth, at two weeks,
    three months, or seven years of age, and variously, often to an
    adult, and their husbands
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"
       id="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span> were thus able to take
       extraordinary precautions against the violation of their
       chastity. On the other hand, it frequently happens,
       especially where marriage by purchase is not developed, that
       the conduct of the girl is not looked after until she is
       married; it becomes immoral only when disapproved by her
       husband. In the Andaman Islands,</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>after puberty the females have indiscriminate
        intercourse ... until they are chosen or allotted as wives,
        when they are required to be faithful to their husbands,
        whom they serve.... If any married or single man goes to an
        unmarried woman, and she declines to have intercourse with
        him by getting up or going to another part of the circle,
        he considers himself insulted, and, unless restrained,
        would kill or wound her.<a id="footnotetag209"
           name="footnotetag209"></a><a href="#footnote209"><sup>209</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Under these conditions the rightness or wrongness of the
    sexual conduct of the wife turned upon the attitude of the
    husband toward the act. Hence a very general practice that the
    husbands prostituted their wives for hire, but punished
    unapproved intercourse:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The chastity of the women does not appear to be held in
        much estimation. The husband will, for a trifling present,
        lend his wife to a stranger, and the loan may be protracted
        by increasing the value of the present. Yet,
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"
           id="page171"></a>[pg 171]</span> strange as it may seem,
           notwithstanding this facility, any connection of this
           kind not authorized by the husband is considered highly
           offensive and quite as disgraceful to his character as
           the same licentiousness in civilized
           societies.<a id="footnotetag210"
           name="footnotetag210"></a><a href="#footnote210"><sup>210</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When woman lost the temporary prestige which she had
    acquired in the maternal system through her greater tendency to
    associated life, and particularly when her person came more
    absolutely into the control of man through the system of
    marriage by purchase, she also accepted and reflected naïvely
    the moral standards which were developed for the most part
    through male activities. Any system of checks and approvals in
    the group, indeed, which was of advantage to the men would be
    of advantage to the women also, since these checks and
    approvals were safeguards of the group as a whole, and not of
    the men only. The person and presence of woman in society have
    stimulated and modified male behavior and male moral standards,
    and she has been a faithful follower, even a stickler for the
    prevalent moral standards (the very tenacity of her adhesion is
    often a sign that she is an imitator); but up to date the
    nature of her activities&mdash;the nature, in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"
       id="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span> short, of the strains she
       has been put to&mdash;has not enabled her to set up
       independently standards of behavior either like or unlike
       those developed through the peculiar male activities.</p>

    <p>There is, indeed, a point of difference in the application
    of standards of morality to men and to women. Morality as
    applied to man has a larger element of the contractual,
    representing the adjustment of his activities to those of
    society at large, or more particularly to the activities of the
    male members of society; while the morality which we think of
    in connection with woman shows less of the contractual and more
    of the personal, representing her adjustment to men, more
    particularly the adjustment of her person to
    men.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"

    <h2>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXOGAMY</h2>

    <p>Perhaps the most puzzling questions which meet the student
    of early society are connected with marriage and kinship; and
    among these questions the practice of exogamy has provoked a
    very large number of ingenious theories. These are, however, I
    believe, all unsatisfactory, either because they are too narrow
    to cover the facts completely, or because they assume in the
    situation conditions which do not exist.<a id="footnotetag211"
       name="footnotetag211"></a><a href="#footnote211"><sup>211</sup></a>
       But quite aside from the facts and the interpretation of the
       facts, all theories in the field have failed to reckon
       sufficiently with the natural disposition and habits of man
       in early society, particularly with his attitude toward
       sexual matters; and it seems entirely feasible to get some
       light on the question why man went outside his immediate
       family and clan for women through an examination of the
       nature of his sexual consciousness, and of the operation of
       this in connection with the laws of habit and attention.</p>

    <p>First of all, it is evident to one who looks carefully
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"
       id="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span> into the question of early
       sex-habits that the lower races are intensely interested in
       sexual life. A large part of their thought, and even of
       their inventive ingenuity, is spent in this direction. The
       pleasures of life are few and gross, but are pursued with
       vigor; and, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, love bears about the
       same relation to the activities of the Australian aborigine
       as it bore to those of Sir Lancelot and the knights of olden
       time.</p>

    <p>A failure to perceive this is the great defect in
    Westermarck's great work, where it is assumed that, if animals
    were monogamous, primitive man must have been much the more so.
    The fact is that in respect to memory, imagination, clothing,
    mode of association, and social restraint man differed
    radically from the animals, and precisely through these added
    qualities he took not only an instinctive, but an artificial
    and reasoned, interest in sexual practices; and this resulted
    in a state of consciousness which made sexual life
    uninterruptedly interesting, in contrast with a pairing season
    among animals, and also in a constant tendency toward
    promiscuity, whether this state was ever actually reached or
    not. The widespread and various unnatural sex practices, the
    use of aphrodisiacs, the practice
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"
       id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span> of drawing attention to the
       girl at puberty, phallic worship, erotic dances, and
       periodic orgies, of which the Orient furnishes so many
       examples, are all found also among the natural
       races.<a id="footnotetag212"
       name="footnotetag212"></a><a href="#footnote212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>

    <p>Again, the eagerness of men to obtain girl wives, and even a
    claim on infants, thus assuring virginity and marriage at the
    moment of sexual maturity;<a id="footnotetag213"
       name="footnotetag213"></a><a href="#footnote213"><sup>213</sup></a>

       name="footnotetag215"></a><a href="#footnote215"><sup>215</sup></a>
       are classes of facts indicating that the sexual element
       occupied a large place in the consciousness of the natural
       races.</p>

    <p>We must also consider the fact that sexual life is
    organically a utilization of a surplus of nutriment, and that
    when food and leisure are abundant there is a tendency on the
    part of sexual activity to become a play activity, just as
    there is a tendency of activities in general to become play
    activities under the same conditions. And while there was no
    leisure class in early society, primitive man was a man of
    leisure <span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"
       id="page178"></a>[pg 178]</span> in the sense that his work
       activities were intermittent; a successful hunt was followed
       by a period of rest, recuperation, and surplus energy, and a
       consequent turning of attention to sexual life, with the
       result that the sex interest appears as one of the main play
       interests among the natural races.</p>

    <p>Under these conditions, and in the absence of any
    considerably developed social institutions or altruistic
    sentiments, we not unnaturally find that the older and stronger
    men have the better of it, both in regard to the food supply
    and the women, and the younger men are obstructed in their
    efforts to satisfy their desires in regard to both. The
    following passages from the ethnological literature of
    Australia indicate the nature of the Australian male in sexual
    life, and the nature of the obstructions encountered by the
    youth in the presence of the older men.<a id="footnotetag216"
       name="footnotetag216"></a><a href="#footnote216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>

    <p>It is noticeable, first of all, that among the Australian
    tribes the older men have worked out or fallen into such habits
    regarding the females that the younger men obtain wives with
    great difficulty and usually not before waiting a long
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"
       id="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span> time. In fact, Spencer and
       Gillen, in their invaluable works on the central Australian
       tribes state that usually a man is married to a woman of
       another generation than himself:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The most usual method of obtaining a wife is that which
        is connected with the well-established custom in accordance
        with which every woman of the tribe is made <i>Tualcha
        mura</i> with some man. The arrangement, which is often a
        mutual one, is made between two men, and it will be seen
        that owing to a girl being made <i>Tualcha mura</i> to a
        boy of her own age the men very frequently have wives much
        younger than themselves, as the husband and the mother of
        the wife obtained in this way are usually approximately of
        the same age. When it has been agreed upon by two men that
        the relationship shall be established between their own
        children, one a boy and the other a girl, the two latter,
        who are generally of a tender age, are taken to the
        <i>Erlukwirra</i>, or women's camp, and here each mother
        takes the other child and rubs it over with a mixture of
        fat and red ochre.... This relationship indicates that the
        man has the right to take as wife the daughter of the
        woman; she is in fact assigned to him, and this, as a rule,
        many years before she is born.<a id="footnotetag217"
           name="footnotetag217"></a><a href="#footnote217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It will be noticed that this is in reality a modification of
    the system of exchanging women, and has an advantage over
    capture, elopement, and charming (all of which are methods in
    practice <span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"
       id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span> among the same tribes) in
       the fact that it is of the nature of a business transaction
       or social agreement, and provokes no bad feeling or
       retaliation. It also shows considerable regard on the part
       of the elders for the young; but practically it is a
       reluctant admission of a youth to participation in sexual
       privileges, since marriage is delayed until a girl of his
       own age has been married and given birth to a girl who in
       turn has become marriageable.</p>

    <p>In the same connection we have the testimony of Curr
    that</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>the marriage customs of the blacks result in very
        ill-assorted unions as regards age; for it is usual to see
        old men with mere girls as wives, and men in the prime of
        life married to old widows. As a rule wives are not
        obtained by the men until they are at least thirty years of
        age. Women have very frequently two husbands during their
        lifetime, the first older and the second younger than
        themselves. Of course, as polygamy is the rule and the men
        of the tribe exceed the females in number besides, there
        are always many bachelors in every tribe; but I never heard
        of a female over sixteen years of age who, prior to the
        breakdown of aboriginal customs after the coming of the
        whites, had not a husband.<a id="footnotetag218"
           name="footnotetag218"></a><a href="#footnote218"><sup>218</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And Bonwick says:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The old men, who get the best food and hold the
        franchise <span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"
           id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span> of the tribe in their
           hands, manage to secure an extra supply of the prettiest
           girls.<a id="footnotetag219"
           name="footnotetag219"></a><a href="#footnote219"><sup>219</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A further evidence of the keen sexual interest of the male
    is furnished by the fact that even when the difficulties in the
    way of getting a wife are regularly overcome by the youth, the
    other men of the group, especially the older ones, reserve a
    temporary but prior claim on her.<a id="footnotetag220"
       name="footnotetag220"></a><a href="#footnote220"><sup>220</sup></a></p>

    <p>In addition to a lively sexual interest in the women of
    their own group, we find that even the lowest races have a
    well-developed appreciation of the property value of women. In
    the earliest times women were the sole creators of certain
    economic values, and since the women contributed as much or
    more to the support of the men as the men contributed to the
    support of the women, the men naturally got and kept as many
    women as possible.<a id="footnotetag221"
       name="footnotetag221"></a><a href="#footnote221"><sup>221</sup></a>
       The condition prevailing in this regard in central Australia
       is stated by Howitt:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>It is an advantage to a man to have as many
        <i>Piraurus</i> as possible. He has then less work to do in
        hunting as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page182"
           id="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span> his <i>Piraurus</i>
           when present supply him with a share of the food which
           they procure, their own <i>Noas</i> being absent. He
           also obtains great influence in the tribe by lending his
           <i>Piraurus</i> occasionally and receiving presents from
           young men to whom <i>Piraurus</i> have not yet been
           allotted, or who may not have <i>Piraurus</i> with them
           in the camp where they are. This is at all times carried
           on, and such a man accumulates a lot of property,
           weapons of all kinds, trinkets, etc., which he in turn
           gives away to prominent men, heads of totems, and such,
           and thus adds to his own influence. This is regarded by
           the Dieri as in no way anything but quite right and
           proper.<a id="footnotetag222"
           name="footnotetag222"></a><a href="#footnote222"><sup>222</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The following passages also from Spencer and Gillen's
    description of the marriage customs of these aborigines show
    both the nature of the sexual system of these tribes in general
    and the well-developed nature of both their sexual and their
    property interest in their women:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The word <i>Nupa</i> is without any exception applied
        indiscriminately by men of a particular group to women of
        another group, and <i>vice versa</i>, and simply implies a
        member of a group of possible wives or husbands, as the
        case may be. While this is so it must be remembered that in
        actual practice each individual man has one or perhaps two
        of these <i>Nupa</i> women who are especially attached to
        himself, and live with him in his own camp. In addition to
        them, however, each man has certain <i>Nupa</i> women
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"
           id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span> beyond the limited
           number just referred to, with whom he stands in the
           relation of <i>Piraungaru</i>. To women who are the
           <i>Piraungaru</i> of a man (the term is a reciprocal
           one) the latter has access under certain conditions, so
           that they may be considered as accessory wives. The
           result is that in the Urabunna tribe every woman is the
           especial <i>Nupa</i> of one particular man, but at the
           same time he has no exclusive right to her as she is the
           <i>Piraungaru</i> of certain other men who also have the
           right of access to her. Looked at from the point of view
           of the man his <i>Piraungaru</i> are a limited number of
           the women who stand in the relation of <i>Nupa</i> to
           him. There is no such thing as one man having the
           exclusive right to one woman; the elder brothers, or
           <i>Nuthie</i>, of the latter, in whose hands the matter
           lies, will give one man a preferential right, but at the
           same time they will give other men of the same group a
           secondary right to her. Individual marriage does not
           exist either in name or in practice in the Urabunna
           tribe. The initiation in regard to establishing the
           relationship of <i>Piraungaru</i> between a man and a
           woman must be taken by the elder brothers, but the
           arrangement must receive the sanction of the old men of
           the group before it can take effect. As a matter of
           actual practice this relationship is usually established
           at times when considerable numbers of the tribe are
           gathered together to perform important ceremonies, and
           when these and other important matters which require the
           consideration of the old men are discussed and settled.
           The number of a man's <i>Piraungaru</i> depends entirely
           upon the measure of his power and popularity; if he be
           what is called "urku," a word which implies much the
           same as our word "influential," he will have a
           considerable number; if he be insignificant or
           <span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"
           id="page184"></a>[pg 184]</span> unpopular, then he will
           meet with scanty treatment. A woman may be
           <i>Piraungaru</i> to a number of men, and as a general
           rule the women and men who are <i>Piraungaru</i> to one
           another are to be found living grouped together. A man
           may always lend his wife, that is, the woman to whom he
           has the first right, to another man, provided always he
           be her <i>Nupa</i>, without the relationship of
           <i>Piraungaru</i> existing between the two, but unless
           this relationship exists no man has any right of access
           to a woman. Occasionally, but rarely, it happens that a
           man attempts to prevent his wife's <i>Piraungaru</i>
           from having access to her, but this leads to a fight,
           and the husband is looked upon as
           churlish.<a id="footnotetag223"
           name="footnotetag223"></a><a href="#footnote223"><sup>223</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The evidence up to this point is presented with a view to
    establishing the fact that the men in early society had the
    strongest interest, both on sexual and on property grounds, in
    retaining a hold on the women of their group; and as an extreme
    expression of this interest I wish to consider the system of
    elopement in early society. While there is no system of
    government by chiefs among the Australian tribes which we have
    been considering, the influence of the old men is very powerful
    in all matters. The initiatory ceremonies, covering periods of
    months and occurring at intervals during a period of years, and
    involving great hardship to the young men, are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"
       id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span> calculated to inspire them
       with great respect for the old men and for the traditional
       practices of the tribe. One of the practical workings of
       this influence of the older men is to throw restraints about
       the young men and obstruct their activities. This
       obstruction is seen quite as clearly on the food side as on
       the side of sex, in the fact that the old men make certain
       foods which are not abundant (notably the kangaroo and the
       opossum) taboo to the young men and the women, and thus
       reserve these delicacies for themselves. We have already
       seen, however, that the tribe usually makes some kind of a
       tardy sexual provision for its male members, and we shall
       presently examine this question more in detail; but the fact
       remains that the desires of the young men are not adequately
       or promptly provided for. They may never get a wife in the
       usual course of things, or they may have to delay marriage
       for a period of twenty years beyond the point of maturity.
       Under these conditions it is to be expected that the young
       men should sometimes attempt to obtain women in spite of
       existing obstructions; and this is the real significance of
       elopement. It is, of course, true that married men sometimes
       eloped with married women, as with us; but in
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"
       id="page186"></a>[pg 186]</span> some of the Australian
       tribes the difficulties in the way of marriage were so great
       that elopement was recognized as the only way out:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The young Kurnai could, as a rule, acquire a wife in one
        way only. He must run away with her. Native marriage might
        be brought about in various ways. If the young man was so
        fortunate as to have an unmarried sister and to have a
        friend who also had an unmarried sister they might arrange
        with the girls to run off together or he might make his
        arrangements with some eligible girl whom he fancied and
        who fancied him; or a girl, if she fancied some young man
        might send him a secret message asking, "Will you find me
        some food?" and this was understood to be a proposal. But
        in every case it was essential for success that the parents
        of the bride should be utterly ignorant of what was about
        to transpire.<a id="footnotetag224"
           name="footnotetag224"></a><a href="#footnote224"><sup>224</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Fison<a id="footnotetag225"
       name="footnotetag225"></a><a href="#footnote225"><sup>225</sup></a>
       is of the opinion that elopement in this case is caused by
       the monopoly of women in the tribe by the older men. Even
       when the assent of the parents has been secured, or when the
       match has been arranged by the parents of the young people,
       it is in some cases necessary to elope because of the
       reluctance of the men in general to have a young woman
       appropriated:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>If the woman was caught her female relatives gave her a
        good beating. Fights took place over these cases between
        the girl's relatives&mdash;both male and female&mdash;and
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"
           id="page187"></a>[pg 187]</span> those of the man. The
           women were generally the most excited; they would stir
           up the men and then assist with their yamsticks. If the
           girl was first caught by other than her own relatives,
           she would be abused by all the men; but this never
           occurred when her parents or brothers were present to
           protect her.<a id="footnotetag226"
           name="footnotetag226"></a><a href="#footnote226"><sup>226</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When we consider the difficulties in the way of young men in
    getting wives at home, we should expect that they would make a
    practice of capturing women from other tribes; and, indeed, it
    is well known that marriage by capture has been assumed to be
    at the base of exogamy by both Lubbock and Spencer. But the
    importance which has been attached to this form of marriage in
    the literature of sociology is due to the fact that these
    eminent writers have constructed theories on the assumption
    that marriage by capture was widespread and important, more
    than to anything else. For, to say nothing of the fact that the
    theories of both these writers are too weak to stand even if
    capture were found to be very prevalent, the evidence from
    Australia shows that capture was comparatively little practiced
    there, although that country affords most of the examples
    referred to by writers on this subject. Spencer and Gillen say
    in this connection:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188"
       id="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The method of capture which has so frequently been
        described as characteristic of Australian tribes, is the
        very rarest way in which the Central Australian secures a
        wife. It does not often happen that a man forcibly takes a
        woman from someone else within his own group, but it does
        sometimes happen, and especially when the man from whom the
        woman is taken has not shown his respect for his actual or
        tribal <i>Ikuntera</i> (father-in-law) by cutting himself
        on the occasion of the death of one or the other of the
        latter's relations. In this case the aggressor will be
        aided by the members of his local group, but in other cases
        of capture he will have to fight for himself. At times,
        however, a woman may be captured from another group, though
        this again is of rare occurrence, and is usually associated
        with an avenging party, the women captured by which, who
        are almost sure to be the wives of men killed, are allotted
        to certain members of the avenging
        party.<a id="footnotetag227"
           name="footnotetag227"></a><a href="#footnote227"><sup>227</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Curr reports to the same effect:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>On rare occasions a wife is captured from a neighboring
        tribe and carried off.... At present, as the stealing of a
        woman from a neighboring tribe would involve the whole
        tribe in war for his sole benefit, and as the possession of
        the woman would lead to constant attacks, tribes set
        themselves generally against the
        practice.<a id="footnotetag228"
           name="footnotetag228"></a><a href="#footnote228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It is, of course, not to be denied that the sexual impulse
    of the male was sometimes strong
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"
       id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span> enough to lead him to seize
       a woman wherever he found her, if he could not get a wife
       otherwise, but there is no evidence that capture ever formed
       a regular or important means of getting
       wives.<a id="footnotetag229"
       name="footnotetag229"></a><a href="#footnote229"><sup>229</sup></a></p>

    <p>On the contrary, the evidence points to the view that as
    soon as for any reason men ceased to marry with the women of
    their own blood and went outside of their immediate families
    for women, they ordinarily secured them in a social, not a
    hostile, way, and from a different branch of their own group,
    not, as a rule, from a strange group. In fact, the regular
    means of securing a wife other than a woman of one's own family
    seems to have been to exchange a woman of one's family for a
    woman of a different family.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The Australian male almost invariably obtains his wife
        or wives either as the survivor of a married brother, or in
        exchange for his sisters, or later on in life for his
        daughters. Occasionally also an ancient widow, whom the
        rightful heir does not claim, is taken possession of by
        some bachelor but for the most part those who have no
        female relatives to give in exchange have to go without
        wives. Girls become wives at from eight to fourteen years.
        Males are <span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"
           id="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span> free to possess wives
           after ... attaining the status of young man, which they
           do when about eighteen years of age. One often sees a
           child of eight the wife of a man of fifty. Females until
           married are the property of their father or his heir,
           and afterwards of their husband, and have scarcely any
           rights. When a man dies his widows devolve on his oldest
           surviving brother of the same caste as
           himself&mdash;that is, full brother. Should a man leave,
           say two widows, each of whom has a son who has attained
           the rank of a young man, then I believe each of the
           young men may dispose of his uterine sister and obtain a
           wife in exchange for her. But should the deceased father
           of the young men have already obtained wives on faith of
           giving these daughters in marriage when of suitable age,
           then the contract made must be kept. When the father is

       that exchange of sisters is one mode of negotiating
       marriage; and Haddon says that in the region of Torres
       Straits marriage is proposed by the woman, but the man must
       either pay for her or furnish a woman in return. In Tud,

        parents for his wife, the usual price being a canoe or
        dugong harpoon, or shell armlet, or goods to equal value.
        The man might give his sister in exchange for a wife, and
        thus save the purchase price. A poor man who had no sister
        might perforce remain unmarried, unless an uncle took pity

       give other examples of marriage by exchange, and I have
       already given a description of the custom of <i>Tualcha
       mura</i>, the <i>regular</i> method of obtaining a wife
       among the central Australians, by means of which a man
       secures a wife for his son by making an arrangement with
       some other man with regard to the latter's daughter.</p>

    <p>From the evidence given first of all I think we must
    conclude that early man was inclined to appropriate whatever
    women came in his way. In this regard we have a condition
    resembling that among the higher animals,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"
       id="page192"></a>[pg 192]</span> where the more vigorous
       males try to monopolize the females. We may assume also that
       the women first appropriated were those born in the
       group&mdash;that is, in the immediate family&mdash;as being
       more proximate and not already possessed by others. In this
       regard also the condition resembled that among the higher
       gregarious animals; and in so far as the control of the
       women by the men of the group is concerned the condition
       remains unchanged. But the men have ceased to marry the
       women of their immediate families, and the problem of
       exogamy is to determine why men living with women and
       controlling them should cease to marry them.</p>

    <p>In other papers I have pointed out that the interest of man
    is not held nor the emotions aroused when the objects of
    attention have grown so familiar in consciousness that the
    problematical and elusive elements
    disappear;<a id="footnotetag235"
       name="footnotetag235"></a><a href="#footnote235"><sup>235</sup></a>
       and I have also alluded to the laws of sexual life, that an
       excited condition of the nervous system is a necessary
       preparation to pairing.<a id="footnotetag236"
       name="footnotetag236"></a><a href="#footnote236"><sup>236</sup></a>
       And just here we must recognize the fact that
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"
       id="page193"></a>[pg 193]</span> monogamy is a habit
       acquired by the race, not because it has answered more
       completely to the organic interest of the individual, but
       because it has more completely served social needs,
       particularly by assuring to the woman and her children the
       undivided interest and providence of the man. But in early
       times the law of natural selection, not the law of choice,
       operated to preserve the groups in which a monogamous or
       quasi-monogamous tendency showed itself (since the children
       in these cases were better trained and nourished), and in
       historical times and among ourselves all of the machinery of
       church and state has been set in motion in favor of the
       system. In point of fact, the members of civilized societies
       at the present time have become so refined and have so far
       accepted ethical standards that monogamy is the system
       actually favored on sentimental grounds as well as on
       grounds of expediency by a large proportion of any civilized
       population. On the other hand, speaking from the biological
       standpoint, monogamy does not, as a rule, answer to the
       conditions of highest stimulation, since here the
       problematical and elusive elements disappear to some extent,
       and the object of attention has grown so familiar in
       consciousnes that the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"
       id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span> emotional reactions are
       qualified. This is the fundamental explanation of the fact
       that married men and women frequently become interested in
       others than their partners in matrimony. I may also just
       allude to the fact that the large body of the literature of
       intrigue, represented by the tales of Boccaccio and Margaret
       of Navarre, is based on the interest in unfamiliar
       women.</p>

    <p>Familiarity with women within the group and unfamiliarity
    with women without the group is the explanation of exogamy on
    the side of interest; and the system of exogamy is a result of
    exchanging familiar women for others. We have seen that capture
    was not an important means of securing wives outside the group,
    and that exogamy was fully developed before property and media
    of exchange were developed to any extent, and consequently
    before the purchase of women had become a system. We have seen
    also that the Australian who wants a woman at the present time
    gets her by exchanging another woman for her. Social groups
    were necessarily small in the beginning. Before invention and
    co-operation have advanced far, the group must remain small in
    order to pick up enough food to sustain life on a given
    area.</p>

    <p>Starting out with a single pair, when the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"
       id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span> family increases in size a
       separation is necessary; and clans are an outcome of the
       process of division and redivision, the bond between the
       clans and their union in a tribe resulting from their
       consciousness of kinship. Now, it is a well-known condition
       of exogamy that, while a man must marry without his clan, he
       must not marry without his tribe, and for the most part, in
       fact, the clan into which he shall marry is designated. In
       other words, allied clans gave their women in exchange
       mutually. This was a natural arrangement, both because the
       two groups were neighbors and because they were friendly,
       and at the same time the psychological demand for newness
       was satisfied. When a family was divided into two branches,
       Branch A had a property interest in its own women, but
       preferred the women of Branch B because of their
       unfamiliarity. The exchange took place at first occasionally
       and not systematically, and the women parted with in each
       case were not, perhaps, in all cases the youngest, and we
       may assume that they had in all cases been married before
       they were given up. But gradually, and when the habit of
       exchange had been established, men came to look forward to
       the exchange and to desire to secure the girl at the
       earliest <span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"
       id="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span> possible moment, until
       finally young women were exchanged at puberty, and virgins.
       When for any reason there is established in a group a
       tendency toward a practice, then the tendency is likely to
       become established as a habit, and regarded as right,
       binding, and inevitable: it is moral and its contrary is
       immoral. When we consider the binding nature of the food
       taboos, of the <i>couvade</i>, and of the regulation that a
       man shall not speak to or look at his mother-in-law or
       sister, we can understand how the habit of marrying out,
       introduced through the charm of unfamiliarity, becomes a
       binding habit.</p>

    <p>I think, therefore, we have every reason to conclude that
    exogamy is one expression of the more restless and energetic
    habit of the male. It is psychologically true that only the
    unfamiliar and not-completely-controlled is interesting. This
    is the secret of the interest of modern scientific pursuit and
    of games. States of high emotional tension are due to the
    presentation of the unfamiliar&mdash;that is, the unanalyzed,
    the uncontrolled&mdash;to the attention. And although the
    intimate association and daily familiarity of family life
    produce affection, they are not favorable to the genesis of
    romantic love. Cognition is so complete that no place is left
    for <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"
       id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span> emotional appreciation. Our
       common expressions "falling in love" and "love at sight"
       imply, in fact, unfamiliarity; and there can be no question
       that men and women would prefer at present to get mates away
       from home, even if there were no traditional prejudice
       against the marriage of near
       kin.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"

    <h2>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODESTY AND CLOTHING</h2>

    <p>No altogether satisfactory theory of the origin of modesty
    has been advanced. The naïve assumption that men were ashamed
    because they were naked, and clothed themselves to hide their
    nakedness, is not tenable in face of the large mass of evidence
    that many of the natural races are naked, and not ashamed of
    their nakedness; and a much stronger case can be made out for
    the contrary view, that clothing was first worn as a mode of
    attraction, and modesty then attached to the act of removing
    the clothing; but this view in turn does not explain an equally
    large number of cases of modesty among races which wear no
    clothing at all. A third theory of modesty, the disgust theory,
    stated by Professor James<a id="footnotetag237"
       name="footnotetag237"></a><a href="#footnote237"><sup>237</sup></a>
       and developed somewhat by Havelock
       Ellis,<a id="footnotetag238"
       name="footnotetag238"></a><a href="#footnote238"><sup>238</sup></a>
       makes modesty the outgrowth of our disapproval of immodesty
       in others&mdash;"the application in the second instance to
       ourselves of judgments primarily passed upon our
       mates."<a id="footnotetag239"
       name="footnotetag239"></a><a href="#footnote239"><sup>239</sup></a>
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"
       id="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span> The sight of offensive
       behavior is no doubt a powerful deterrent from like
       behavior, but this seems to be a secondary manifestation in
       the case of modesty. The genesis of modesty is rather to be
       found in the activity in the midst of which it appears, and
       not in the inhibition of activity like the activity of
       others. It appears also that it has primarily no connection
       with clothing whatever.<a id="footnotetag240"
       name="footnotetag240"></a><a href="#footnote240"><sup>240</sup></a></p>

    <p>Professor Angell and Miss Thompson have made an
    investigation of the relation of circulation and respiration to
    attention, which advances considerably our knowledge of the
    nature of the emotions. They say:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>When the active process runs smoothly and
        uninterruptedly, these bodily activities [circulation and
        respiration] progress with rhythmic regularity. Relatively
        tense, strained attention is generally characterized by
        more vigorous bodily accompaniments than is low-level,
        gentle, and relatively relaxed attention (drowsiness, for
        instance); but both agree, so long as their progress is
        free and unimpeded, in relative regularity of bodily
        functions. Breaks, shocks, and mal-co-ordinations of
        attention are accompanied by sudden, spasmodic changes and
        irregularities <span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"
           id="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span> in bodily processes,
           the amount and violence of such changes being roughly
           proportioned to the intensity of the experiences.</p>

        <p>Now, emotions represent psychological conditions of
        great instability. Especially is this true when the emotion
        is profound. The necessity is suddenly thrown upon the
        organism of reacting to a situation with which it is at the
        moment able to cope only imperfectly, if at all. The
        condition is one in which normal, uninterrupted,
        coordinated movements are for a time checked and thrown out
        of gear.<a id="footnotetag241"
           name="footnotetag241"></a><a href="#footnote241"><sup>241</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And again, in concluding their admirable study:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>All the processes with which we have been dealing are
        cases of readjustment of an organism to its environment.
        Attention is always occupied with the point in
        consciousness at which the readjustment is taking place. If
        the process of readjustment goes smoothly and evenly, we
        have a steady strain of attention&mdash;an equilibrated
        motion in one direction. The performance of mental
        calculation is a typical case of this sort of attention.
        But often the readjustment is more difficult. Factors are
        introduced which at first refuse to be reconciled with the
        rest of the conscious content. The attentive equilibrium is
        upset, and there are violent shifts back and forth as it
        seeks to recover itself. These are the cases of violent
        emotion. Between these two extremes comes every shade
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"
           id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span> of difficulty in the
           readjustment, and of consequent intensity in emotional
           tone. We have attempted to show in the preceding paper
           that the readjustment of organism to environment
           involves a maintenance of the equilibrium of the bodily
           processes, which runs parallel with the maintenance of
           the attentive equilibrium, and is an essential part of
           the readjustment of the psycho-physical organism.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The more motile organisms are constantly, by very reason of
    their motility, encountering situations which put a strain upon
    the attention. The quest for food leads to encounters with
    members of their own and of different species; the resulting
    fight, pursuit, and flight are accompanied by the powerful
    emotions of anger and fear. The emotion is, as Darwin has
    pointed out, a part of the effort to reaccommodate, since it is
    a physiological preparation for action appropriate to the type
    of situation in question.<a id="footnotetag242"
       name="footnotetag242"></a><a href="#footnote242"><sup>242</sup></a>
       The strain upon the attention, the affective bodily
       condition, and the motor activity appear usually in the same
       connection, and, from the standpoint of biological design,
       the action concluding the series of bodily activities is of
       advantage to the
       organism.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"
       id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span>

    <p>In animal life the situation is simple. Whether the animal
    decides to fight for it or to run for it, he has at any rate
    two plain courses before him, and the relation between his
    emotional states and the type of situation is rather definitely
    fixed racially, and relatively constant. Even in the associated
    life of animals the type of reaction is not much changed, and
    is here also instinctively fixed. But in mankind the
    instinctive life is overshadowed or rivaled by the freedom of
    initiative secured through an extraordinary development of the
    power of inhibition and of associative memory, while, at the
    same time, this freedom of choice is hindered and checked by
    the presence of others. The social life of mankind brings out a
    thousand situations unprovided for in the instincts and
    unanticipated in consciousness. In the midst, then, of a
    situation relatively new in race experience, where advantage is
    still the all-important consideration, and where this can no
    longer be secured either by fighting or running, but by the
    good opinion of one's fellows as well, we may look for some new
    strains upon the attention and some emotions not common to
    animal life.</p>

    <p>I do not think we can entirely understand the nature of
    these emotional expressions in the race
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"
       id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span> unless we realize that man
       is, in his savage as well as his civilized state, enormously
       sensitive to the opinion of others.<a id="footnotetag243"
       name="footnotetag243"></a><a href="#footnote243"><sup>243</sup></a>
       The longing of the Creek youth to "bring in hair" and be
       counted a man; the passion of the Dyak of Borneo for heads,
       and the recklessness of the modern soldier, "seeking the
       bubble reputation at the cannon's mouth;" the alleged action
       of the young women of Kansas in taking a vow to marry no man
       who had not been to the Philippine war, and of the ladies of
       Havana, during the rebellion against Spain, in sending a
       chemise to a young man who stayed at home, with the
       suggestion that he wear it until he went to the
       field&mdash;all indicate that the opinion of one's fellows
       is at least as powerful a stimulus as any found in nature.
       To the student of ethnology no point in the character of
       primitive man is more interesting and surprising than his
       vanity. This unique susceptibility to social influence is,
       indeed, essential to the complex institutional and
       associational life of mankind. The transmission of language,
       tradition, morality, knowledge, and all race experience from
       the older to the younger, and from one generation to
       another, is accomplished through mental suggestibility, and
       the activity of the individual in
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"
       id="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span> associational life is
       mediated largely through it.</p>

    <p>Now, taking them as we find them, we know that such emotions
    as modesty and shame are associated with actions which injure
    and shock others, and show us off in a bad light. They are
    violations of modes of behavior which have become habitual in
    one way and another. In an earlier paper<a id="footnotetag244"
       name="footnotetag244"></a><a href="#footnote244"><sup>244</sup></a>
       have indicated some of the steps by which approvals and
       disapprovals were set up in the group. When once a habit is
       fixed, interference with its smooth running causes an
       emotion. The nature of the habit broken is of no importance.
       If it were habitual for <i>grandes dames</i> to go barefoot
       on our boulevards or to wear sleeveless dresses at high
       noon, the contrary would be embarrassing. Psychologically
       the important point is that, when the habit is set up, the
       attention is in equilibrium. When inadvertently or under a
       sufficiently powerful stimulus we break through a habit, the
       attention and associative memory are brought into play. We
       are conscious of a break, of what others will think; we
       anticipate a damaged or diminished personality; we are, in a
       word, upset. We may consequently expect to find that
       whatever brings <span class="pagenum"><a name="page208"
       id="page208"></a>[pg 208]</span> the individual into
       conflict with the ordinary standards of life of the society
       in which he is living is the occasion of a strain on the
       attention and of an accompanying bodily
       change.<a id="footnotetag245"
       name="footnotetag245"></a><a href="#footnote245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>

    <p>A minimum expression of modesty, and one having an organic
    rather than a social basis, is seen in the coyness of the
    female among animals. In many species of animals the female
    does not submit at once to the solicitations of the male, but
    only after the most arduous wooing.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The female cuckoo answers the call of her mate with an
        alluring laugh that excites him to the utmost, but it is
        long before she gives herself up to him. A mad chase
        through tree tops ensues, during which she constantly
        incites him with that mocking call, till the poor fellow is
        fairly driven crazy. The female kingfisher often torments
        her devoted lover for half a day, coming and calling him,
        and then taking to flight. But she never lets him out of
        her sight the while, looking back as she flies, and
        measuring her speed, and wheeling back when he suddenly
        gives up the pursuit.<a id="footnotetag246"
           name="footnotetag246"></a><a href="#footnote246"><sup>246</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"
       id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>

    <p>There is here a rapid shifting of attention between organic
    impulse to pair and organic dread of pairing, until an
    equilibrium is reached, which is not essentially different from
    the case, in human society, of that woman who, "whispering, 'I
    will ne'er consent,' consented." In either case, the minimum
    that it is necessary to assume is an organic hesitancy, though
    in the case of woman social hesitancy may play even the greater
    rôle. Pairing is in its nature a seizure, and the coquetry of
    the female goes back, perhaps, to an instinctive aversion to
    being seized.</p>

    <p>Our understanding of the nature of modesty is here further
    assisted by the consideration that the same stimulus does not
    produce the same reaction under all circumstances, but, on the
    contrary, may result in totally contrary effects. A show of
    fight may produce either anger or fear; social attention may
    gratify us from one person and irritate us from another; or the
    attentions of the same person may annoy us today and please us
    tomorrow. Mere movement is, to

       id="page210"></a>[pg 210]</span> take another instance, one
       of the most powerful stimuli in animal life; and, if we
       examine its meaning among animals, we find that the same
       movement may have different meanings in terms of sex. If the
       female runs, the movement attracts the notice of the male,
       and the movement is a sexual stimulus. Or the movement may
       be a movement of avoidance&mdash;a running-away; and in this
       way the female may secure contrary desires by the same
       general type of activity. Or, on the other hand, not-running
       is a condition of pairing, and is also a means of avoiding
       the attention of the male. Similarly modesty has a twofold
       meaning in sexual life. In appearance it is an avoidance of
       sexual attention, and at many moments it is an avoidance in
       fact. But we have seen in the case of the birds that the
       avoidance is, at the pairing season, only a part of the
       process of working up the organism to the nervous pitch
       necessary for pairing.</p>

    <p>But without going farther into the question of the
    psychology of wooing, it is evident that very delicate
    attention to behavior is necessary to be always attractive and
    never disgusting to the opposite sex, and even the most serious
    attention to this problem is not always
    successful.<a id="footnotetag247"
       name="footnotetag247"></a><a href="#footnote247"><sup>247</sup></a>
       Sexual <span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"
       id="page211"></a>[pg 211]</span> association is a
       treacherous ground, because our likes and dislikes turn upon
       temperamental traits rather than on the judgment, or, at any
       rate, upon modes of judgment not clearly analyzable in
       consciousness. An openness of manner in the relations of the
       sexes is very charming, but a little more, and it is
       boldness, or, if it relates to bodily habits, indecency. A
       modest behavior is charming, but too much modesty is
       prudery. Under these circumstances, when the suggestive
       effect of bodily habits is realized, but the effect of a
       given bit of behavior cannot be clearly reckoned, and when,
       at the same time, the effect produced by the action is felt
       to be very important to happiness, it is to be expected that
       there should often be a conflict between the tendency to
       follow a stimulus and the tendency to inhibit it, a hovering
       between advance and retreat, assent and negation&mdash;a
       disturbed state of attention, and an organic hesitancy,
       resulting in the emotional overflow of blushing when the act
       is realized or thought as improper.</p>

    <p>But, however thin and movable the partitions
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"
       id="page212"></a>[pg 212]</span> between attraction and
       disgust, every person is aware of certain standards of
       behavior, derived either from the strain of personal
       relationship or by imitation of current modes of behavior.
       The girl of the unclothed races who takes in sitting a
       modest attitude is acting on the result of experience. She
       may have been often annoyed by the attentions of men at
       periods when their attention was not welcome, and in this
       case the action is one of shrinking and avoidance. She
       doubtless has in mind also that all females are not at all
       times attractive to all males, that female boldness
       sometimes excites disgust, and that the concealment of the
       person may be more attractive than its exposure.</p>

    <p>This more or less instinctive recognition of the suggestive
    power of her person and her corresponding attitude of modesty
    have been assisted also by her observation of the experiences
    of other women, and by the talk of the older women. I may add
    the following instances to make it plain that the sexual
    relation is the object of much attention from both sexes in
    primitive society, and furnishes occasion for the interruption
    of the smooth flow of the attention and the bodily activities.
    Describing the use of magic
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"
       id="page213"></a>[pg 213]</span> by the male Australians in
       obtaining wives, Spencer and Gillen add:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>In the case of charming, however, the initiative may be
        taken by the woman, who can, of course, imagine that she
        has been charmed, and then find a willing aider and abettor
        in the man, whose vanity is flattered by the response to
        the magic power which he can soon persuade himself that he
        did really exercise.<a id="footnotetag248"
           name="footnotetag248"></a><a href="#footnote248"><sup>248</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If this attempt at suggestion failed, we should have a case
    of lively embarrassment in the woman, and her discomfiture
    would be heightened if the other women and men of the community
    were aware of her attempt. Similarly on Jervis Island in Torres
    Straits, if an unmarried woman was interested in a man, she
    accosted him, but the man did not address the woman "for, if
    she refused him, he would feel ashamed, and maybe he would
    brain her with a stone club, and so 'he would kill her for
    nothing.'"<a id="footnotetag249"
       name="footnotetag249"></a><a href="#footnote249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>

    <p>A wholesale unsettling of habit is seen when a lower culture
    is impinged upon by a higher. The consciousness of other
    standards of behavior <span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"
       id="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span> causes new forms of modesty
       in the lower race. Haddon reports of the natives of Torres
       Straits:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The men were formerly nude, and the women wore only a
        leaf petticoat, but I gather that they were a decent
        people; now both sexes are prudish. A man would never go
        nude before me&mdash;only once or twice has it happened to
        me, and then only when they were diving.... Amongst
        themselves they are, of course, much less particular, but I
        believe they are becoming more so.... I have not noticed
        any reticence in their speaking about sexual matters before
        the young, but missionary influence has modified this a
        great deal; formerly, I imagine, there was no restraint in
        speech, now there is a great deal of prudery;... and I had
        the greatest possible difficulty in getting the little
        information I did about the former relationships between
        the sexes. All this, I suspect, is not really due to a
        sense of decency <i>per se</i>, but rather to a desire on
        their part not to appear barbaric to strangers; in other
        words, the hesitancy is between them and the white man, not
        as between themselves.<a id="footnotetag250"
           name="footnotetag250"></a><a href="#footnote250"><sup>250</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Bonwick says also:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I have repeatedly been amused at observing the
        Australian natives prepare for their approach to the abode
        of civilization by wrapping their blankets more decently
        around them and putting on their ragged trousers or
        petticoats.<a id="footnotetag251"
           name="footnotetag251"></a><a href="#footnote251"><sup>251</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There are numerous cases found among the lower races where
    the wearing of clothing and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"
       id="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span> ornament are not associated
       with feelings of modesty. Von den Steinen reports that the
       women of Brazil wore a small, delicately made and ornamented
       covering or <i>uluri</i>, which evidently had an attractive
       as well as protective value; but the women showed no
       embarrassment, but rather astonishment, when he asked them
       to remove them and give them to him. When they understood
       that he really wanted them, they removed them and gave them
       to him with a laugh.<a id="footnotetag252"
       name="footnotetag252"></a><a href="#footnote252"><sup>252</sup></a>
       This is a case, in fact, of the beginning of clothing
       without a beginning of modesty. But while we find cases of
       modesty without clothing and of clothing without modesty the
       two are usually found together, because clothing and
       ornament are the most effective means of drawing the
       attention to the person, sometimes by concealing it and
       sometimes by emphasizing it.</p>

    <p>The original covering of the body was in the nature of
    ornament rather than clothing. The waist, the neck, the wrists,
    and the ankles are smaller than the portion of the body
    immediately below them, and are from this anatomical accident a
    suitable place to tie ornaments, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page216"
       id="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span> the ornamentation of the
       body results incidently in giving some degree of covering to
       the body. The most suggestive use of clothing is the use of
       just a sufficient amount to call attention to the person,
       without completely concealing it. I need not refer to the
       fact that in modern society this is accomplished by, or
       perhaps we should better say transpires in connection with,
       diaphanous fabrics and décolleté dresses; and the same
       effect was doubtless accomplished by a typical early form of
       female dress, of which I will give one instance in Australia
       and one in America:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Among the Arunta and Luricha the women normally wear
        nothing, but amongst tribes farther north, especially the
        Kaitish and Warramunga, a small apron is made and worn, and
        this sometimes finds its way south into the Arunta.
        Close-set strands of fur-string hang vertically from a
        string waist-girdle. Each strand is about eight or ten
        inches in length, and the breadth of the apron may reach
        the same size, though it is often not more than six inches
        wide.<a id="footnotetag253"
           name="footnotetag253"></a><a href="#footnote253"><sup>253</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Mr. Powers says:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>A fashionable young Wittun woman wears a girdle of deer
        skin, the lower edge of which is slit into a long fringe,
        with the polished pine-nut at the end of each strand, while
        the upper border and other portions are studded with
        brilliant bits of shell.<a id="footnotetag254"
           name="footnotetag254"></a><a href="#footnote254"><sup>254</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"
       id="page217"></a>[pg 217]</span>

    <p>If we recall the psychological standpoint that the emotions
    are an organic disturbance of equilibrium occurring when
    factors difficult of reconciliation are brought to the
    attention, and if we have in mind that the association of the
    sexes has furnished so powerful an emotional disturbance as
    jealousy, it seems a simple matter to explain the comparatively
    mild by-play of sexual modesty as a function of wooing, without
    bringing either clothing or ornament into the question.</p>

    <p>We saw a minimum expression of modesty in the courtship of
    animals, where the modesty of the female was a form of fear on
    the organic side, but the accompanying movements of avoidance
    were, at the same time, a powerful attraction to the male. And
    we have in this, as in all expressions of fear&mdash;shame,
    guilt, timidity, bashfulness&mdash;an affective bodily state
    growing out of the strain thrown upon the attention in the
    effort of the organism to accommodate itself to its
    environment. The essential nature of the reaction is already
    fixed in types of animal life where the operation of disgust is
    out of the question, and in relations which imply no attention
    to the conduct of others. If any separation between the bodily
    self and the environment
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page218"
       id="page218"></a>[pg 218]</span> is to be made at all, it is
       putting the cart before the horse to make out that modesty
       is derived from our repugnance at the conduct of others,
       more immediately than through attention to the meaning of
       our own activities. The fallacy of the disgust theory lies,
       in fact, in the attempt to separate the copies for imitation
       derived from our own activities from those derived from our
       observation of the activities of others.</p>

    <p>When habits are set up and are running smoothly, the
    attention is withdrawn; and nakedness was a habit in the
    unclothed societies, just as it may become a habit now in the
    artist's model. But when, for any of the reasons I have
    outlined, women or men began to cover the body, then putting
    off the covering became peculiarly suggestive, because the
    breaking-up of a habit brings an act clearly into attention.
    And when dress becomes habitual in a society whose sense of
    modesty has also developed to a high degree, the suggestive
    effect is so great that the bare thought of unclothing the
    person becomes painful, and we have the possibility of such a
    phenomenon as mock modesty. But, so far as sexual modesty is
    concerned, the clothing has only reinforced the already great
    suggestive power of the sexual
    characters.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"
       id="page219"></a>[pg 219]</span>

    <p>In animal society the coyness of the female is the analogue
    of modesty. The male is always aggressive, and in both animal
    and human society used ornament as a means of interesting and
    influencing the female. In the course of time, however, man's
    activities became his main dependence, and woman's person and
    personal behavior became more significant, especially in a
    state of society where she became dependent on man's
    activities, and both ornament and modesty were largely
    transferred to her.</p>

    <p>In speaking of the relation of sex to
    morality,<a id="footnotetag255"
       name="footnotetag255"></a><a href="#footnote255"><sup>255</sup></a>
       I have already shown that the morality of man is peculiarly
       a morality of prowess and contract, while woman's morality
       is to a greater degree a morality of bodily habits, both
       because child-bearing, which is a large factor in
       determining sexual morality, is more closely connected with
       her person, and in consequence also of male jealousy.
       Physiologically and socially reproduction is more identified
       with the person of woman than of man, and it has come about
       that her sexual behavior has been more closely looked after,
       not only by men, but by women&mdash;for it would not be
       difficult to show that women
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"
       id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span> have been always, as they
       are still, peculiarly watchful of one another in this
       respect.</p>

    <p>In the course of history woman developed an excessive and
    scrupulous concern for the propriety of her behavior,
    especially in connection with her bodily habits; and this in
    turn became fixed and particularized by fashion, with the
    result that not only her physical life became circumscribed,
    but her attention and mental interests became limited largely
    to safeguarding and enhancing her person.</p>

    <p>The effect of this and of other similar restrictions of
    behavior on her character and mind is indicated in following
    chapters.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"
       id="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span>

    <h2>THE ADVENTITIOUS CHARACTER OF WOMAN</h2>

    <p>There is more than one bit of evidence that nature changed
    her plan with reference to some organism at the very last
    moment, and introduced a feature which was not contemplated at
    the outset. This change of plan is carried out through the
    specialization of some organ, sense, or habit, to such a degree
    as to make practically a new type of the organism. In the human
    species, for example, the atrophied organs distributed through
    the body are evidence that the physical make-up of the species
    was well-nigh definitely fixed before the advantage of free
    hands led to an erect posture, thereby throwing certain sets of
    muscles out of use; and the specialization of the voice as a
    means of communicating thought was, similarly, a device for
    relieving the hands of the burden of communication, and was not
    introduced systematically until a gesture language had been so
    well established that even now we fall back into it
    unconsciously, especially in moments of excitement, and attempt
    to talk with our hands and
    bodies.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224"
       id="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span>

    <p>But perhaps the most interesting modification or reversal of
    plan to be noted in mankind is connected with the relation of
    the two sexes. As will presently be indicated, life itself was
    in the beginning female, so far as sex could be postulated of
    it at all, and the life-process was primarily a female process,
    assisted by the male. In humankind as well, nature obviously
    started out on the plan of having woman the dominant force,
    with man as an aid; but after a certain time there was a
    reversal of plan, and man became dominant, and woman dropped
    back into a somewhat unstable and adventitious relation to the
    social process. Up to a certain point, in fact, in his physical
    and social evolution man shows an interesting structural and
    mental adaptation to woman, or to the reproductive process
    which she represents; while the later stages of history show,
    on the other hand, that the mental attitude of woman, and
    consequently her forms of behavior, have been profoundly
    modified, and even her physical life deeply affected, by her
    effort to adjust to man.</p>

    <p>The only attitude which nature can be said to show toward
    life is the design that the individual shall sustain its own
    life, and at death leave others of its kind&mdash;that it shall
    get food, avoid <span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"
       id="page225"></a>[pg 225]</span> destruction, and reproduce.
       In pursuance of this policy it naturally turns out that
       those types showing greater morphological and functional
       complexity, along with freer movement and more mental
       ingenuity, come into the more perfect control and use of
       their environment, and consequently have greater likelihood
       of survival. Failing of this greater complexity, their
       chance of life lies in occupying so obscure a position, so
       to speak, that they do not come into collision with more
       dominant forms, or in reproducing at such a rate as to
       survive in spite of this. The number of devices in the way
       of modification of form and habit to secure advantage is
       practically infinite, but all progressive species have
       utilized the principle of sex as an accessory of success. By
       this principle greater variability is secured, and among the
       larger number of variations there is always a chance of the
       appearance of one of superior fitness. The male in many of
       the lower forms is very insignificant in size, economically
       useless (as among the bees), often a parasite on the female,
       and, as many biologists hold, merely a secondary device or
       afterthought of nature, designed to secure greater variation
       than can be had by the asexual mode of reproduction. In
       other words, he is of use to the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"
       id="page226"></a>[pg 226]</span> species by assisting the
       female to reproduce progressively fitter forms.</p>

    <p>When, in the course of time, sexual reproduction eventuated
    in a mammalian type, with greater intimacy between mother and
    offspring and a longer period of dependence of offspring on the
    mother, the function of the male in assisting the female became
    social as well as biological; and this was pre-eminently so in
    the case of man, because of the pre-eminent helplessness of the
    human child.<a id="footnotetag256"
       name="footnotetag256"></a><a href="#footnote256"><sup>256</sup></a>
       The characteristic helplessness of the child, which at first
       thought appears to be a disadvantage, is in fact the source
       of human superiority, since the design of nature in
       providing this condition of helplessness is to afford a
       lapse of time sufficient for the growth of the very complex
       mechanism, the human brain, which, along with free hands, is
       the medium through which man begins that reaction on his
       environment&mdash;inventing, exterminating, cultivating,
       domesticating, organizing&mdash;which ends in his
       supremacy.</p>

    <p>It is plain, therefore, that species in which growth is slow
    are at an advantage, if to the care and nourishment of the
    female are added the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"
       id="page227"></a>[pg 227]</span> providence and protection
       of the male; and this is especially true in mankind, where
       growth is not completed for a long period of years. In this
       connection we have an explanation of the alleged greater
       variability of the male. Instead of an insignificant
       addendum to the reproductive process, he becomes larger than
       the female, masterful, jealous, a fighting
       specialization&mdash;still an attaché of the female, but now
       a defender and provider. This is the general condition among
       mammals; and among mankind the longer dependence of children
       results in a correspondingly lengthened and intimate
       association of the parents, which we denominate marriage.
       For Westermarck is quite right in his view that children are
       not the result of marriage, but marriage is the result of
       children. From this point of view marriage is a union
       favored by the scheme of nature because it is favorable to
       the rearing and training of children, and the groups
       practicing marriage, or its animal analogue, have the best
       chance of survival.</p>

    <p>But the evolution of a courageous and offensive disposition
    naturally did not result in an eminently domestic disposition.
    Man did the hunting and fighting. He was attached to the woman,
    but he was not steady. He did not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"
       id="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span> stay at home. The woman and
       the child were the core of society, the fixed point, the
       point to which man came back. There consequently grew up a
       sort of dual society and dual activity. Man represented the
       more violent and spasmodic activities, involving motion and
       skillful co-ordinations, as well as organization for hunting
       and fighting; while woman carried on the steady, settled
       life. She was not able to wander readily from a fixed point,
       on account of her children; and, indeed, her physical
       organization fitted her for endurance rather than movement.
       Consequently her attention was turned to industries, since
       these were compatible with settled and stationary habits.
       Agriculture, pottery, weaving, tanning, and all the
       industrial processes involved in working up the by-products
       of the chase, were developed by her. She domesticated man
       and assisted him in domesticating the animals. She built her
       house, and it was hers. She did not go to her husband's
       group after marriage. The child was hers, and remained a
       member of her group. The germ of social organization was,
       indeed, the woman and her children and her children's
       children. The old women were the heads of civil society,
       though the men <span class="pagenum"><a name="page229"
       id="page229"></a>[pg 229]</span> had developed a fighting
       organization and technique which eventually swallowed them
       up.</p>

    <p>From the standpoint of physical force, man was the master,
    and was often brutal enough. But woman led an independent life,
    to some extent. She was, if not economically independent, at
    least economically creative, and she enjoyed the great
    advantage of being less definitely interested in man than he
    was in her. For while woman is more deeply involved
    physiologically in the reproductive life than man, she is
    apparently less involved from the standpoint of immediate
    stimulus, or her interest is less acute in consciousness. The
    excess activity which characterizes man in his relation to the
    general environment holds also for his attitude toward woman.
    Not only is the male the wooer among the higher orders of
    animals and among men, but he has developed all the accessories
    for attracting attention&mdash;in the animals, plumage, color,
    voice, and graceful and surprising forms of motion; and in man,
    ornament and courageous action. For primitive man, like the
    male animal, was distinguished by ornament.</p>

    <p>Up to this time the relation of man to woman was the natural
    development of a relation calculated
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"
       id="page230"></a>[pg 230]</span> to secure the best results
       for the species. His predacious disposition had been, in
       part at least, developed in the service of woman and her
       child, and he was emotionally dependent on her to such a
       degree that he used all the arts of attraction at his
       command to secure a relation with her. In the course of
       time, however, an important change took place in
       environmental conditions. While woman had been doing the
       general work and had developed the beginnings of many
       industries, man had become a specialist along another line.
       His occupation had been almost exclusively the pursuit of
       animals or conflict with his neighbors; and in this
       connection he had become the inventor of weapons and traps,
       and in addition had learned the value of acting in concert
       with his companions. But a hunting life cannot last forever;
       and when large game began to be exhausted, man found himself
       forced to abandon his destructive and predacious activities,
       and adopt the settled occupations of woman. To these he
       brought all the inventive technique and capacity for
       organized action which he had developed in his hunting and
       fighting life, with the result that he became the master of
       woman in a new sense. Not suddenly, but in the course of
       time, he usurped her <span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"
       id="page231"></a>[pg 231]</span> primacy in the industrial
       pursuits, and through his organization of industry and the
       application of invention to the industrial processes became
       a creator of wealth on a scale before unknown. Gradually
       also he began to rely not altogether on ornament, exploits,
       and trophies to get the attention and favor of woman. When
       she was reduced to a condition of dependence on his
       activity, wooing became a less formidable matter; he
       purchased her from her male kindred, and took her to his own
       group, where she was easier to control.</p>

    <p>In unadvanced stages of society, where machinery and the
    division of labor and a high degree of organization in industry
    have not been introduced, and among even our own lower classes,
    woman still retains a relation to industrial activities and has
    a relatively independent status. Among the Indians of this
    country it was recognized that a man could not become wealthy
    except through the possession of a sufficient number of wives
    to work up for trade the products of the chase; and today the
    West African youth does not seek a young woman in marriage but
    an old one, preferably a widow, who knows all about the arts of
    preparing and adulterating rubber. Among peasants, also, and
    plain people <span class="pagenum"><a name="page232"
       id="page232"></a>[pg 232]</span> the proverb recognizes that
       the "gray mare is the better horse." The heavy, strong,
       enduring, patient, often dominant type, frequently seen
       among the lower classes, where alone woman is still
       economically functional, is probably a good representative
       of what the women of our race were before they were reduced
       by man to a condition of parasitism which, in our middle and
       so-called higher classes, has profoundly affected their
       physical, mental, and moral life.</p>

    <p>On the moral side, particularly, man's disposition to bend
    the situation to his pleasure placed woman in a hard position
    and resulted in the distortion of her nature, or rather in
    bringing to the front elemental traits which under our moral
    code are not reckoned the best. In the animal world the female
    is noted for her indirection. On account of the necessity of
    protecting her young, she is cautious and cunning, and, in
    contrast with the open and pugnacious methods of the more
    untrammeled male, she relies on sober colors, concealment,
    evasion, and deception of the senses. This quality of cunning
    is, of course, not immoral in its origin, being merely a
    protective instinct developed along with maternal feeling. In
    woman, also, this tendency to prevail by passive means rather
    than by assault is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page233"
       id="page233"></a>[pg 233]</span> natural; and especially
       under a system of male control, where self-realization is
       secured either through the manipulation of man or not at
       all, a resort to trickery, indirection, and hypocrisy is not
       to be wondered at. Man has, however, always insisted that
       woman shall be better than he is, and her immoralities are
       usually not such as he greatly disapproves. There has, in
       fact, been developed a peculiar code of morals to cover the
       peculiar case of woman. This may be called a morality of the
       person and of the bodily habits, as contrasted with the
       commercial and public morality of man. Purity, constancy,
       reserve, and devotion are the qualities In woman which
       please and flatter the jealous male; and woman has responded
       to these demands both really and seemingly. Without any
       consciousness of what she was doing (for all moral
       traditions fall in the general psychological region of
       habit), she acts in the manner which makes her most pleasing
       to men. And&mdash;always with the rather definite
       realization before her of what a dreadful thing it is to be
       an old maid&mdash;she has naïvely insisted that her sisters
       shall play well within the game, and has become herself the
       most strict censor of that morality which has become
       traditionally associated with woman. Fearing the obloquy
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"
       id="page234"></a>[pg 234]</span> which the world attaches to
       a bad woman, she throws the first stone at any woman who
       bids for the favor of men by overstepping the modesty of
       nature. Morality, in the most general sense, represents the
       code under which activities are best carried on, and is
       worked out in the school of experience. It is pre-eminently
       an adult and a male system, and men are intelligent enough
       to recognize that neither women nor children have passed
       through this school. It is on this account that, while man
       is merciless to woman from the standpoint of personal
       behavior, he exempts her from anything in the way of
       contractual morality, or views her defections in this regard
       with allowance and even with amusement.</p>

    <p>In the absence of any participation in commercial activity
    and with no capital but her personal charms and her wits, and
    with the possibility of realizing on these only through a
    successful appeal to man, woman naturally puts her best foot
    first. It was, of course, always one of the functions of the
    female to charm the male; but so long as woman maintained her
    position of economic usefulness and her quasi-independence she
    had no great problem, for there was never a chance in primitive
    society, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"
       id="page235"></a>[pg 235]</span> any more than in animal
       society, that a woman would go unmated. But when through
       man's economic and social organization, and the male
       initiative, she became dependent, and when in consequence he
       began to pick and choose with a degree of fastidiousness,
       and when the less charming women were not
       married&mdash;especially when "invidious distinctions" arose
       between the wed and unwed, and the desirably wed and the
       undesirably wed-woman had to charm for her life; and she not
       only employed the passive arts innate with her sex, but
       flashed forth in all the glitter which had been one of man's
       accessories in courtship, but which he had dispensed with
       when the superiority acquired through occupational pursuits
       enabled him to do so. Under a new stimulation to be
       attractive, and with the addition of ornament to the
       repertory of her charms, woman has assumed an almost
       aggressive attitude toward courtship. The means of
       attraction she employs are so highly elaborated, and her
       technique is so finished, that she is really more active in
       courtship than man. We speak of man as the wooer, but
       falling in love is really mediated by the woman. By dress,
       behavior, coquetry, modesty, reserve, and occasional
       boldness she gains the attention of
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page236"
       id="page236"></a>[pg 236]</span> man and infatuates him. He
       does the courting, but she controls the process. "Er glaubt
       zu schieben, und er wird geschoben."</p>

    <p>The condition of limited stimulation, also, in which woman
    finds herself as a result of the control by man of wealth, of
    affairs, of the substantial interests of society, and even of
    her own personality, leads woman to devote herself to display
    as an interest in itself, regardless of its effect on men. In
    doing this she is really falling back on an instinct. One of
    the most powerful stimulations to either sex is glitter, in the
    most general sense, and the interest in showing off begins in
    the coloration and plumage of animals, and continues as
    ornament in the human species. It is true that the wooing
    connotation of ornament was originally its most important one,
    and that it was characteristic of man in particular; but woman
    has generalized it as an interest, and as a means of
    self-realization. She seeks it as a means of charming men, of
    outdoing other women, and as an artistic interest; and her
    attention often takes that direction to such a degree that its
    acquisition means satisfaction, and its lack discontent.
    Sometimes, indeed, when a woman is married and knows that she
    is "sped," she drops the display pose altogether,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"
       id="page237"></a>[pg 237]</span> tends to lose herself in
       household interests, and to become a slattern. On the other
       hand, she often makes marriage the occasion of display on a
       more elaborate scale, and is pitiless in her demands for the
       means to this. A glance at the windows of our great stores
       shows that men have organized their business in a full
       appreciation of these facts. Dressing, indeed, becomes a
       competitive game with women, and since their opponents and
       severest critics are women, it turns out curiously enough
       that they dress even more with reference to the opinion of
       women than for men.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The earth hath bubbles as the water has,</p>

            <p>And these are of them.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It would, of course, be absurd to censure woman too greatly
    for these frailties, and it would be very unjust to imply that
    all women share them. Some women, in adapting themselves to the
    situation, follow apparently, a bent acquired in connection
    with the maternal instinct, and become true and devoted and
    grand to a degree hardly known by man. Others, following a bent
    gotten along with coquetry in connection with the wooing
    instinct, and having no activity through which their behavior
    is standardized, become difficile, unreal, inefficient,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"
       id="page238"></a>[pg 238]</span> exacting, unsatisfied,
       absurd. And we have also the paradox that the same woman can
       be the two things at different times. There is therefore a
       basis of truth in Pope's hard saying that "Women have no
       characters at all." Because their problem is not to
       accommodate to the solid realities of the world of
       experience and sense, but to adjust themselves to the
       personality of men, it is not surprising that they should
       assume protean shapes.</p>

    <p>Moreover, man is so affected by the charms of woman, and
    offers so easy a mark for her machinations, as to invite
    exploitation. Having been evolved largely through the stimulus
    of the female presence, he continues to be more profoundly
    affected by her presence and behavior than by any other
    stimulus whatever, unless it be the various forms of combat.
    From Samson and Odysseus down, history and story recognize the
    ease and frequency with which a woman makes a fool of a man.
    The male protective and sentimental attitude is indeed
    incompatible with resistance. To charm, pursue, court, and
    possess the female, involve a train of memories which color all
    after-relations with the whole sex. In both animals and men
    there is an instinctive disposition to take a great deal off
    the female. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page239"
       id="page239"></a>[pg 239]</span> The male animal takes the
       assaults of the female complacently and shamefacedly, "just
       like folks." Peasants laugh at the hysterical outbreaks of
       their women, and the "bold, bad man" is as likely to be
       henpecked as any other. Woman is a disturbing element in
       business and in school to a degree not usually apprehended.
       In her presence a man instinctively assumes a different
       attitude. He is, in fact, so susceptible as seemingly,
       almost, to want to be victimized, and, as Locke expressed
       the matter, "It is in vain to find fault with those arts of
       deceiving wherein men find pleasure to be deceived."</p>

    <p>This disposition of man and the detached condition of woman
    have much to do with the emergence of the adventuress and the
    sporting-woman. Human nature was made for action; and perhaps
    the most distressing and disconcerting situation which
    confronts it is to be played on by stimulations without the
    ability to function. The mere superinducing of passivity, as in
    the extreme case of solitary confinement, is sufficient to
    produce insanity; and the emotion of dread, or passive fear, is
    said to be the most painful of emotions, because there is no
    possibility of relief by action. Modern woman is in a similar
    condition of constraint and unrest, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page240"
       id="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span> produces organic ravages
       for which no luxury can compensate. The general ill-health
       of girls of the better classes, and the equally general
       post-matrimonial breakdown, are probably due largely to the
       fact that the nervous organization demands more normal
       stimulations and reactions than are supplied. The American
       woman of the better classes has superior rights and no
       duties, and yet she is worrying herself to death&mdash;not
       over specific troubles, but because she has lost her
       connection with reality. Many women, more intelligent and
       energetic than their husbands and brothers, have no more
       serious occupations than to play the house-cat, with or
       without ornament. It is a wonder that more of them do not
       lose their minds; and that more of them do not break with
       the system entirely is due solely to the inhibitive effects
       of early habit and suggestion.</p>

    <p>As long as woman is comfortably cared for by the men of her
    group or by marriage, she is not likely to do anything rash,
    especially if the moral standards in her family and community
    are severe. But an unattached woman has a tendency to become an
    adventuress&mdash;not so much on economic as on psychological
    grounds. Life is rarely so hard that a young woman cannot earn
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page241"
       id="page241"></a>[pg 241]</span> her bread; but she cannot
       always live and have the stimulations she craves. As long,
       however, as she remains with her people and is known to the
       whole community, she realizes that any infraction of the
       habits of the group, any immodesty or immorality, will ruin
       her standing and her chance of marriage, and bring her into
       shame and confusion. Consequently, good behavior is a
       protective measure&mdash;instinctive, of course; for it is
       not true that the ordinary girl has imagination enough to
       think out a general attitude toward life other than that
       which is habitual in her group. But when she becomes
       detached from home and group, and is removed not only from
       surveillance, but from the ordinary stimulation and interest
       afforded by social life and acquaintanceship, her
       inhibitions are likely to be relaxed.</p>

    <p>The girl coming from the country to the city affords one of
    the clearest cases of detachment. Assuming that she comes to
    the city to earn her living, her work is not only irksome, but
    so unremunerative that she finds it impossible to obtain those
    accessories to her personality in the way of finery which would
    be sufficient to hold her attention and satisfy her if they
    were to be had in plenty. She is lost from the sight of
    everyone <span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"
       id="page242"></a>[pg 242]</span> whose opinion has any
       meaning for her, while the separation from her home
       community renders her condition peculiarly flat and lonely;
       and she is prepared to accept any opportunity for
       stimulation offered her, unless she has been morally
       standardized before leaving home. To be completely lost
       sight of may, indeed, become an object under these
       circumstances&mdash;the only means by which she can without
       confusion accept unapproved stimulations&mdash;and to pass
       from a regular to an irregular life and back again before
       the fact has been noted is not an unusual course.</p>

    <p>The professionally irregular class of women represents an
    extreme and unfortunate result of an adventitious and
    not-completely-functional relation to society. They do not form
    a class in the psychological sense, but only a trade. There are
    many sorts of natural dispositions among them&mdash;as many
    perhaps as will be found in any other occupation. None of the
    reputable occupations are homogeneous from the standpoint of
    the natural dispositions of the men and women who compose them,
    and the same is true of the disreputable occupations. Many
    women of fine natural character and disposition are drawn in a
    momentary and incidental way into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page243"
       id="page243"></a>[pg 243]</span> an irregular life, and
       recover, settle down to regular modes of living, drift
       farther, are married, and make uncommonly good wives. In
       this respect the adventuress is more fortunate than the
       criminal (that other great adventitious product), because
       the criminal is labeled and his record follows him, making
       reformation difficult; while the in-and-out life of woman
       with reference to what we call virtue is not officially
       noted and does not bring consequences so inevitable. But "if
       you drive nature out at the door, she will come back through
       the window;" and this interest in greater stimulation is, I
       believe, the dominant force in determining the
       choice&mdash;or, rather, the drift&mdash;of the so-called
       sporting-woman. She is seeking what, from the psychological
       standpoint, may be called a normal life.</p>

    <p>The human mind was formed and fixed once for all in very
    early times, through a life of action and emergency, when the
    species was fighting, contriving, and inventing its way up from
    the sub-human condition; and the ground-patterns of interest
    have never been, and probably never will be, fundamentally
    changed. Consequently, all pursuits are irksome unless they are
    able, so to speak, to assume the guise of this early conflict
    for life in connection with which interest
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"
       id="page244"></a>[pg 244]</span> and modes of attention were
       developed. As a matter of fact, however, anything in the
       nature of a problem or a pursuit stimulates the emotional
       centers, and is interesting, because it is of the same
       general pattern as these primitive pursuits and problems.
       Scientific and artistic pursuits, business, and the various
       occupational callings are analogues of the hunting, flight,
       pursuit, courtship, and capture of early racial life, and
       the problems they present may, and do, become all-absorbing.
       The moral and educational problem of development has been,
       indeed, to substitute for the simple, co-ordinative killing,
       escaping, charming, deceiving activities of early life,
       analogues which are increasingly serviceable to society, and
       to expand into a general social feeling the affection
       developed first in connection with courtship, the rearing of
       children, and joint predatory and defensive enterprises. The
       gamester, adventuress, and criminal are not usually abnormal
       in a biological sense, but have failed, through defective
       manipulation of their attention, to get interested in the
       right kind of problems. Their attention has not been
       diverted from interests of a primary type containing a
       maximum of the sensory, to interests of an analogous type
       containing more <span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"
       id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span> elements of reflection, and
       involving problems and processes of greater benefit to
       society.</p>

    <p>The remedy for the irregularity, pettiness, ill-health, and
    unserviceableness of modern woman seems to lie, therefore,
    along educational lines. Not in a general and cultural
    education alone, but in a special and occupational interest and
    practice for women, married and unmarried. This should be
    preferably gainful, though not onerous nor incessant. It
    should, in fact, be a play-interest, in the sense that the
    interest of every artist and craftsman, who loves his work and
    functions through it, is a play-interest. Normal life without
    normal stimulation is not possible, and the stimulations
    answering to the nature of the nervous organization seem best
    supplied by interesting forms of work. This reinstates racially
    developed stimulations better than anything except play; and
    interesting work is, psychologically speaking, play.</p>

    <p>Some kind of practical activity for women would also relieve
    the strain on the matrimonial situation&mdash;a situation which
    at present is abnormal and almost impossible. The demands for
    attention from husbands on the part of wives are greater than
    is compatible with the absorbing general activities of the
    latter, and women are <span class="pagenum"><a name="page246"
       id="page246"></a>[pg 246]</span> not only neglected by the
       husband in a manner which did not happen in the case of the
       lover, but they are jealous of men in a more general sense
       than men are jealous of women. In the absence of other
       interests they are so dependent on the personal interest
       that they unconsciously put a jealous construction, not only
       on personal behavior, but on the most general and
       indifferent actions of the men with whom their lives are
       bound up; and this process is so obscure in consciousness
       that it is usually impossible to determine what the matter
       really is.</p>

    <p>An examination, also, of so-called happy marriages shows
    very generally that they do not, except for the common interest
    of children, rest on the true comradeship of like minds, but
    represent an equilibrium reached through an extension of the
    maternal interest of the woman to the man, whereby she looks
    after his personal needs as she does after those of the
    children&mdash;cherishing him, in fact, as a child&mdash;or in
    an extension to woman on the part of the man of that nurture
    and affection which is in his nature to give to pets and all
    helpless (and preferably dumb) creatures.</p>

    <p>Obviously a more solid basis of association is necessary
    than either of these two instinctively
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"
       id="page247"></a>[pg 247]</span> based compromises; and the
       practice of an occupational activity of her own choosing by
       woman, and a generous attitude toward this on the part of
       man, would contribute to relieve the strain and to make
       marriage more frequently
       successful.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"

    <h2>THE MIND OF WOMAN AND THE LOWER RACES</h2>

    <h3>I</h3>

    <p>The mind is a very wonderful thing, but it is questionable
    whether it is more wonderful than some of the instinctive modes
    of behavior of lower forms of life. If mind is viewed as an
    adjustment to external conditions for the purpose of securing
    control, the human mind is no more wonderful in its way than
    the homing and migratory instincts of birds; the tropic quality
    of the male butterfly which leads it to the female though she
    is imprisoned in a cigar-box in a dark room; or the peculiar
    sensitivity of the bat which enables it, though blinded, to
    thread its way through a maze of obstructions hung about a
    room.</p>

    <p>The fact of sensitivity, in short, or the quality of
    response to stimulation, is more wonderful than its particular
    formulation in the human brain. Mind simply represents a
    special development of the quality of sensitivity common to
    organic nature, and analogous to the sensitivity of the
    photographic plate. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"
       id="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span> brain receives impressions,
       records them, remembers them, compares new experiences with
       old, and modifies behavior, in the presence of a new or
       recurrent stimulation, in view of the pleasure-pain
       connotation of similar situations in the past.</p>

    <p>In very low forms of life, as is well known, there is no
    development of brain or special organs of sense; but the
    organism is pushed and pulled about by light, heat, gravity,
    and acid and other chemical forces, and is unable to decline to
    act on any stimulus reaching it. It reacts in certain
    characteristic, habitual, and adequate ways, because it
    responds uniformly to the same stimulation; but it has no
    choice, and is controlled by the environment. The object of
    brain development is to reverse these conditions and control
    the actions of the organism, and of the outside world as well,
    from within. With the development of the special organs of
    sense, memory, and consequent ability to compare present
    experiences with past, with inhibition or the ability to
    decline to act on a stimulus, and, finally, with abstraction or
    the power of separating general from particular aspects, we
    have a condition where the organism sits still, as it were, and
    picks and chooses its <span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"
       id="page253"></a>[pg 253]</span> reactions to the outer
       world; and, by working in certain lines to the exclusion of
       others, it gains in its turn control of the environment, and
       begins to reshape it.</p>

    <p>All the higher animals possess in some degree the powers of
    memory, judgment, and choice; but in man nature followed the
    plan of developing enormously the memory, on which depend
    abstraction, or the power of general ideas, and the reason. In
    order to secure this result, the brain, or surface for
    recording experience, was developed out of all proportion with
    the body. In the average European the brain weighs about 1,360
    grams, or 3 per cent. of the body weight, while the average
    brain weight of some of the great anthropoid apes is only about
    360 grams, or, in the orangoutang, one-half of 1 per cent. of
    the body weight. In point of fact, nature seems to have reached
    the limit of her materials in creating the human species. The
    development of hands freed from locomotion and a brain out of
    proportion to bodily weight are <i>tours de force</i>, and, so
    to speak, an afterthought, which put the heaviest strain
    possible on the materials employed, and even diverted some
    organs from their original design. A number of ailments like
    hernia, appendicitis, and uterine displacement,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"
       id="page254"></a>[pg 254]</span> are due to the fact that
       the erect posture assumed when the hands were diverted from
       locomotion to prehensile uses put a strain not originally
       contemplated on certain tissues and organs. Similarly, the
       proportion of idiocy and insanity in the human species shows
       that nature had reached the limit of elasticity in her
       materials and began to take great risks. The brain is a
       delicate and elaborate organ on the structural side, and in
       these cases it is not put together properly, or it gets
       hopelessly out of order. This strain on the materials is
       evident in all races and in both sexes, and indicates that
       the same general structural ground-pattern has been followed
       in all members of the species.</p>

    <p>Viewed from the standpoint of brain weight, all races are,
    broadly speaking, in the same class. For while the relatively
    small series of brains from the black race examined by
    anthropologists shows a slight inferiority in
    weight&mdash;about 45 grams in negroes&mdash;when compared with
    white brains, the yellow race shows more than a corresponding
    superiority to the white; in the Chinese about 70 grams. There
    is also apparently no superiority in brain weight in modern
    over ancient times. The cranial capacity of Europeans between
    the eleventh and eighteenth centuries,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page255"
       id="page255"></a>[pg 255]</span> as shown by the cemeteries
       of Paris, is not appreciably different from that of
       Frenchmen of today, and the Egyptian mummies show larger
       cranial capacity than the modern Egyptians. Furthermore, the
       limits of variation between individuals in the same race are
       wider than the average difference between races. In a series
       of 500 white brains, the lowest and highest brains will
       differ, in fact, as much as 650 grams in weight.</p>

    <p>There is also no ground for the assumption that the brain of
    woman is inferior to that of man; for, while the average brain
    of woman is smaller, the average body weight is also smaller,
    and it is open to question whether the average brain weight of
    woman is smaller in proportion to body
    weight.<a id="footnotetag257"
       name="footnotetag257"></a><a href="#footnote257"><sup>257</sup></a>
       The importance of brain weight in relation to intelligence,
       moreover, has usually been much exaggerated by
       anthropologists; for intelligence depends on the rapidity
       and range of the acts of associative memory, and this in
       turn on the complexity of the neural processes. Brains are,
       in fact, like timepieces in this respect, that the small
       ones work "excellent well" if they are good material and
       well put <span class="pagenum"><a name="page256"
       id="page256"></a>[pg 256]</span> together. Although brains
       occasionally run above 2,000 grams in weight (that of the
       Russian novelist Turgenieff weighed 2,012), the brains of
       many eminent men are not distinguished for their great size.
       That of the French statesman Gambetta weighed only 1,160
       grams. It must be borne in mind also that there are many
       individuals among the lower races and among women having
       brain weight much in excess of that of that of the average
       male white.</p>

    <p>Of all the possible ways of treating the brain for the
    purpose of testing its intelligence, that of weighing is the
    least satisfactory, and has been most indefatigably practiced.
    A better method, that of counting the nerve cells, has been
    lately introduced, but to treat a single brain in this way is a
    work of years, and no series of results exists. In the meantime
    Miss Thompson, in co-operation with Professor Angell, has
    completed a study of the mental traits of men and women on what
    is perhaps the best available principle&mdash;that of a series
    of laboratory tests which eliminate or take into consideration
    differences due to the characteristic habits of the two sexes.
    Her findings are probably the most important contribution in
    this field, and her <span class="pagenum"><a name="page257"
       id="page257"></a>[pg 257]</span> general conclusion on
       differences of sex will, I think, hold also for differences
       of race:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The point to be emphasized as the outcome of this study
        is that, according to our present light, the psychological
        differences of sex seem to be largely due, not to
        difference of average capacity, nor to difference in type
        of mental activity, but to differences in the social
        influences brought to bear on the developing individual
        from early infancy to adult years. The question of the
        future development of the intellectual life of women is one
        of social necessities and ideals rather than of the inborn
        psychological characteristics of sex.<a id="footnotetag258"
           name="footnotetag258"></a><a href="#footnote258"><sup>258</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There is certainly great difference in the mental ability of
    individuals, and there are probably less marked differences in
    the average ability of different races; but difference in
    natural ability is, in the main, a characteristic of the
    individual, not of race or of sex. It is probable that brain
    efficiency (speaking from the biological standpoint) has been,
    on the average, approximately the same in all races and in both
    sexes since nature first made up a good working-model, and that
    differences in intellectual expression are mainly social rather
    than biological, dependent on the fact that different stages of
    culture present different experiences
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"
       id="page258"></a>[pg 258]</span> to the mind, and
       adventitious circumstances direct the attention to different
       fields of interest.</p>

    <h3>II</h3>

    <p>In approaching the question of the parity or disparity of
    the mental ability of the white and the lower races, we bring
    to it a fixed and instinctive prejudice. No race views another
    race with that generosity with which it views itself. It may
    even be said that the existence of a social group depends on
    its taking an exaggerated view of its own importance; and in a
    state of nature, at least, the same is true of the individual.
    If self-preservation is the first law of nature, there must be
    on the mental side an acute consciousness of self, and a habit
    of regarding the self as of more importance than the world at
    large. The value of this standpoint lies in the fact that,
    while a wholesome fear of the enemy is important, a wholesome
    contempt is even more so. Praising one's self and dispraising
    an antagonist creates a confidence and a mental superiority in
    the way of confidence. The vituperative recriminations of
    modern prize-fighters, the boastings of the Homeric heroes, and
    the <i>bôgan</i> of the old Germans, like the back-talk of the
    small boy, were calculated to screw the courage
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"
       id="page259"></a>[pg 259]</span> up; and the Indians of
       America usually gave a dance before going on the war-path,
       in which by pantomime and boasting they magnified themselves
       and their past, and so stimulated their self-esteem that
       they felt invincible. In race-prejudice we see the same
       tendency to exalt the self and the group at the expense of
       outsiders. The alien group is belittled by attaching
       contempt to its peculiarities and habits&mdash;its color,
       speech, dress, and all the signs of its personality. This is
       not a laudable attitude, but it has been valuable to the
       group, because a bitter and contemptuous feeling is an aid
       to good fighting.</p>

    <p>No race or nation has yet freed itself from this tendency to
    exalt and idealize itself. It is very difficult for a member of
    western civilization to understand that the orientals regard us
    with a contempt in comparison with which our contempt for them
    is feeble. Our bloodiness, our newness, our lack of reverence,
    our land-greed, our break-neck speed and lack of appreciation
    of leisure make Vandals of us. On the other hand, we are very
    stupid about recognizing the intelligence of orientals. We have
    been accustomed to think that there is a great gulf between
    ourselves and other races; and this persists in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"
       id="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span> an undefinable way after
       scores of Japanese have taken high rank in our schools, and
       after Hindus have repeatedly been among the wranglers in
       mathematics at Cambridge. It is only when one of the far
       eastern nations has come bodily to the front that we begin
       to ask ourselves whether there is not an error in our
       reckoning.</p>

    <p>The instinct to belittle outsiders is perhaps at the bottom
    of our delusion that the white race has one order of mind and
    the black and yellow races have another. But, while a
    prejudice&mdash;a matter of instinct and emotion&mdash;may well
    be at the beginning of an error of this kind, it could not
    sustain itself in the face of our logical habits unless
    reinforced by an error of the judgment. And this error is found
    in the fact that in a naïve way we assume that our steps in
    progress from time to time are due to our mental superiority as
    a race over other races, and to the mental superiority of one
    generation of ourselves over the preceding.</p>

    <p>In this we are confusing advance in culture with brain
    improvement. If we should assume a certain grade of
    intelligence, fixed and invariable in all individuals, races,
    and times&mdash;an unwarranted assumption, of
    course&mdash;progress <span class="pagenum"><a name="page261"
       id="page261"></a>[pg 261]</span> would still be possible,
       provided we assumed a characteristically human grade of
       intelligence to begin with. With associative memory,
       abstraction, and speech men are able to compare the present
       with the past, to deliberate and discuss, to invent, to
       abandon old processes for new, to focus attention on special
       problems, to encourage specialization, and to transmit to
       the younger generation a more intelligent standpoint and a
       more advanced starting-point. Culture is the accumulation of
       the results of activity, and culture could go on improving
       for a certain time even if there were a retrogression in
       intelligence. If all the chemists in class A should stop
       work tomorrow, the chemists in class B would still make
       discoveries. These would influence manufacture, and progress
       would result. If a worker in any specialty acquaints himself
       with the results of his predecessors and contemporaries and
       <i>works</i>, he will add some results to the sum of
       knowledge in his line. And if a race preserves by record or
       tradition the memory of what past generations have done, and
       adds a little, progress is secured whether the brain
       improves or stands still. In the same way, the fact that one
       race has advanced farther in culture than another does not
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"
       id="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span> necessarily imply a
       different order of brain, but may be due to the fact that in
       the one case social arrangements have not taken the shape
       affording the most favorable conditions for the operation of
       the mind.</p>

    <p>If, then, we make due allowance for our instinctive tendency
    as a white group to disparage outsiders, and, on the other
    hand, for our tendency to confuse progress in culture and
    general intelligence with biological modification of the brain,
    we shall have to reduce very much our usual estimate of the
    difference in mental capacity between ourselves and the lower
    races, if we do not eliminate it altogether; and we shall
    perhaps have to abandon altogether the view that there has been
    an increase in the mental capacity of the white race since
    prehistoric times.</p>

    <p>The first question arising in this connection is whether any
    of the characteristic faculties of the human
    mind&mdash;perception, memory, inhibition,
    abstraction&mdash;are absent or noticeably weak in the lower
    races. If this is found to be true, we have reason to attribute
    the superiority of the white race to biological causes;
    otherwise we shall have to seek an explanation of white
    superiority in causes lying outside the brain.</p>

    <p>In examining this question we need not dwell
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page263"
       id="page263"></a>[pg 263]</span> on the acuteness of the
       sense-perceptions, because these are not distinctively
       human. As a matter of fact, they are usually better
       developed in animals and in the lower races than in the
       civilized, because the lower mental life is more perceptive
       than ratiocinative. The memory of the lower races is also
       apparently quite as good as that of the higher. The memory
       of the Australian native or the Eskimo is quite as good as
       that of our "oldest inhabitant;" and probably no one would
       claim that the modern scientist has a better memory than the
       bard of the Homeric period.</p>

    <p>There is, however, a prevalent view, for the popularization
    of which Herbert Spencer is largely responsible, that primitive
    man has feeble powers of inhibition. Like the equally erroneous
    view that early man is a free and unfettered creature, it
    arises from our habit of assuming that, because his inhibitions
    and unfreedom do not correspond with our own restraints, they
    do not exist. Sir John Lubbock pointed out long ago that the
    savage is hedged about by conventions so minute and so
    mandatory that he is actually the least free person in the
    world. But, in spite of this, Spencer and others have insisted
    that he is incapable of self-restraint, is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page264"
       id="page264"></a>[pg 264]</span> carried away like a child
       by the impulse of the moment, and is incapable of rejecting
       an immediate gratification for a greater future one. Cases
       like the one mentioned by Darwin of the Fuegian who struck
       and killed his little son when the latter dropped a basket
       of fish into the water are cited without regard to the fact
       that cases of sudden domestic violence and quick repentance
       are common in any city today; and the failure of the
       Australian blacks to throw back the small fry when seining
       is referred to without pausing to consider that our practice
       of exterminating game and denuding our forests shows an
       amazing lack of individual self-restraint.</p>

    <p>The truth is that the restraints exercised in a group depend
    largely on the traditions, views, and teachings of the group,
    and, if we have this in mind, the savage cannot be called
    deficient on the side of inhibition. It is doubtful if modern
    society affords anything more striking in the way of inhibition
    than is found in connection with taboo, fetish, totemism, and
    ceremonial among the lower races. In the great majority of the
    American Indian and Australian tribes a man is strictly
    forbidden to kill or eat the animals whose name his clan bears
    as a totem. The central Australian may not, in addition,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"
       id="page265"></a>[pg 265]</span> eat the flesh of any animal
       killed or even touched by persons standing in certain
       relations of kinship to him. At certain times also he is
       forbidden to eat the flesh of a number of animals and at all
       times he must share all food secured with the tribal elders
       and some others.</p>

    <p>A native of Queensland will put his mark on an unripe zamia
    fruit, and may be sure that it will be untouched and that when
    it is ripe he has only to go and get it. The Eskimos, though
    starving, will not molest the sacred seal basking before their
    huts. Similarly in social intercourse the inhibitions are
    numerous. To some of his sisters, blood and tribal, the
    Australian may not speak at all; to others only at certain
    distances, according to the degree of kinship. The west African
    fetish acts as a police, and property protected by it is safer
    than under civilized laws. Food and palm wine are placed beside
    the path with a piece of fetish suspended near by, and no one
    will touch them without leaving the proper payment. The garden
    of a native may be a mile from the house, unfenced, and
    sometimes unvisited for weeks by the owner; but it is immune
    from depredations if protected by fetish. Our proverb says, "A
    hungry belly has no ears," and it must be admitted that the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page266"
       id="page266"></a>[pg 266]</span> inhibition of food impulses
       implies no small power of restraint.</p>

    <p>Altogether too much has been made of inhibition, anyway, as
    a sign of mentality, for it is not even characteristic of the
    human species. The well-trained dog inhibits in the presence of
    the most enticing stimulations of the kitchen. And it is also
    true that one race, at least&mdash;the American
    Indian&mdash;makes inhibition of the most conspicuous feature
    in its system of education. From the time the ice is broken to
    give him a cold plunge and begin the toughening process on the
    day of his birth, until he dies with out a groan under torture
    the Indian is schooled in the restraint of his impulses. He
    does not, indeed, practice our identical restraints, because
    his traditions and the run of his attention are different; but
    he has a capacity for controlling impulse equal to our own.</p>

    <p>Another serious charge against the intelligence of the lower
    races is lack of the power of abstraction. They certainly do
    not deal largely in abstraction, and their languages are poor
    in abstract terms. But there is a great difference between the
    habit of thinking in abstract terms and the ability to do
    so.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267"
       id="page267"></a>[pg 267]</span>

    <p>The degree to which abstraction is employed in the
    activities of a group depends on the complexity of the
    activities and on the complexity of consciousness in the group.
    When science, philosophy, and logic, and systems of reckoning
    time, space, and number are taught in the schools; when the
    attention is not so much engaged in perceptual as in deliberate
    acts; and when thought is a profession, then abstract modes of
    thought are forced on the mind. This does not argue absence of
    the power of abstraction in the lower races, or even a low
    grade of ability, but lack of practice. To one skilled in any
    line an unpracticed person seems very stupid; and this is
    apparently the reason why travelers report that the black and
    yellow races have feeble powers of abstraction. It is generally
    admitted, however, that the use of speech involves the power of
    abstraction, so that all races have the power in some degree.
    When we come further to examine the degree in which they
    possess it, we find that they compare favorably with ourselves
    in any test which involves a fair comparison.</p>

    <p>The proverb is a form of abstraction practiced by all races,
    and is perhaps the best test of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page268"
       id="page268"></a>[pg 268]</span> natural bent of the mind in
       this direction, because, like ballad poetry, and slang,
       proverbial sayings do not originate with the educated class,
       but are of popular origin. At the same time, proverbs
       compare favorably with the <i>mots</i> of literature, and
       many proverbs have, in fact, drifted into literature and
       become connected with the names of great writers. Indeed,
       the saying that there is nothing new under the sun applies
       with such force and fidelity to literature that, if we
       should strip Hesiod and Homer and Chaucer of such phrases as
       "The half is greater than the whole," "It is a wise son that
       knows his own father" (which Shakespeare quotes the other
       end about), and "To make a virtue of necessity," and if we
       should further eliminate from literature the motives and
       sentiments also in ballad poetry and in popular thought,

    <p>On the side of number we have another test of the power of
    abstraction; and while the lower races show lack of practice in
    this, they show no lack of power. It is true that tribes have
    been <span class="pagenum"><a name="page271"
       id="page271"></a>[pg 271]</span> found with no names for
       numbers beyond two, three, or five; but these are isolated
       groups, like the Veddahs and Bushmen, who have no trade or
       commerce, and lead a miserable existence, with little or
       nothing to count. The directions of attention and the
       simplicity or complexity of mental processes depend on the
       character of the external situation which the mind has to
       manipulate. If the activities are simple, the mind is
       simple, and if the activities were nil, the mind would be
       nil. The mind is nothing but a means of manipulating the
       outside world. Number, time, and space conceptions and
       systems become more complex and accurate, not as the human
       mind grows in capacity, but as activities become more varied
       and call for more extended and accurate systems of notation
       and measurement. Trade and commerce, machinery and
       manufacture, and all the processes of civilization involve
       specialization in the apprehension of series as such. Under
       these conditions the number technique becomes elaborate and
       requires time and instruction for its mastery. The advance
       which mathematics has made within a brief historical time is
       strikingly illustrated by the words with which the
       celebrated mathematician, Sir
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"
       id="page272"></a>[pg 272]</span> Henry Savile, who died in
       1662, closed his career as a professor at Oxford:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>By the grace of God, gentlemen hearers, I have performed
        my promise. I have redeemed my pledge. I have explained,
        according to my ability, the definitions, postulates,
        axioms, and the first eight propositions of the
        <i>Elements</i> of Euclid. Here, sinking under the weight
        of years, I lay down my art and my
        instruments.<a id="footnotetag260"
           name="footnotetag260"></a><a href="#footnote260"><sup>260</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>From the standpoint of modern mathematics, Sir Henry Savile
    and the Bushman are both woefully backward; and in both cases
    the backwardness is not a matter of mental incapacity, but of
    the state of the science.</p>

    <p>In respect, then, to brain structure and the more important
    mental faculties we find that no race is radically unlike the
    others. Still, it might happen that the mental activities and
    products of two groups were so different as to place them in
    different classes. But precisely the contrary is true. There is
    in force a principle called the law of parallelism in
    development, according to which any group takes much the same
    steps in development as any other. The group may be belated,
    indeed, and not reach certain stages, but the ground patterns
    of life are the same in the lower races and in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"
       id="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span> higher. Mechanical
       inventions, textile industries, rude painting, poetry,
       sculpture, and song, marriage and family life, organization
       under leaders, belief in spirits, a mythology, and some form
       of church and state exist universally. At one time students
       of mankind, when they found a myth in Hawaii corresponding
       to the Greek story of Orpheus and Eurydice, or an Aztec poem
       of tender longing in absence, or a story of the deluge, were
       wont to conjecture how these could have been carried over
       from Greek or Elizabethan or Hebraic sources, or whether
       they did not afford evidence of a time when all branches of
       the human race dwelt together with a common fund of
       sentiment and tradition. But this standpoint has been
       abandoned, and it is recognized that the human mind and the
       outside world are essentially alike the world over; that the
       mind everywhere acts on the same principles; and that,
       ignoring the local, incidental, and eccentric, we find
       similar laws of growth among all peoples.</p>

    <p>The number of things which can stimulate the human mind is
    somewhat definite and limited. Among them, for example, is
    death. This happens everywhere, and the death of a dear one may
    cause the living to imagine ways of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page274"
       id="page274"></a>[pg 274]</span> being reunited. The story
       of Orpheus and Eurydice may thus arise spontaneously and
       perpetually, wherever death and affection exist. Or, there
       may be a separation from home and friends, and the mind runs
       back in distress and longing over the happy past, and the
       state of consciousness aroused is as definite a fact among
       savages as among the civilized. A beautiful passage in Homer
       represents Helen looking out on the Greeks from the wall of
       Troy and saying:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>And now behold I all the other glancing-eyed Achaians,
        whom well I could discern and tell their names; but two
        captains of the host can I not see, even Kastor tamer of
        horses and Polydukes the skilful boxer, mine own brethren
        whom the same mother bare. Either they came not in the
        company from lovely Lakedaimon; or they came hither indeed
        in their seafaring ships, but now will not enter into the
        battle of the warriors, for fear of the many scornings and
        revilings that are mine.<a id="footnotetag261"
           name="footnotetag261"></a><a href="#footnote261"><sup>261</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When this passage is thus stripped of its technical
    excellence by a prose translation, we may compare it with the
    following New Zealand lament composed by a young woman who was
    captured on the island of Tuhua and carried to a mountain from
    which she could see her
    home:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"
       id="page275"></a>[pg 275]</span>

    <blockquote>
        <p>My regret is not to be expressed. Tears, like a spring,
        gush from my eyes. I wonder whatever is Tu Kainku [her
        lover] doing, he who deserted me. Now I climb upon the
        ridge of Mount Parahaki, whence is clear the view of the
        island of Tuhua. I see with regret the lofty Tanmo where
        dwells [the chief] Tangiteruru. If I were there, the
        shark's tooth would hang from my ear. How fine, how
        beautiful should I look!... But enough of this; I must
        return to my rags and to my nothing at
        all.<a id="footnotetag262"
           name="footnotetag262"></a><a href="#footnote262"><sup>262</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The situation of the two women in this case is not
    identical, and it would be possible to claim that the Greek and
    Maori passages differ in tone and coloring; but it remains true
    that a captive woman of any race will feel much the same as a
    captive woman of any other race when her thoughts turn toward
    home, and that the poetry growing out of such a situation will
    be everywhere of the same general pattern.</p>

    <p>Similarly, to take an illustration from morals, we find that
    widely different in complexion and detail as are the moral
    codes of lower and higher groups, say the Hebrews and the
    African Kafirs, yet the general patterns of morality are
    strikingly coincident. It is reported of the Kafirs that "they
    possess laws which meet every crime which may be committed."
    Theft is punished by restitution and fine; injuring cattle, by
    death <span class="pagenum"><a name="page276"
       id="page276"></a>[pg 276]</span> or fine; false witness, by
       a heavy fine; adultery, by fine or death; rape, by fine or
       death; poisoning or witchcraft, by death and confiscation of
       property; murder, by death or fine; treason or desertion
       from the tribe, by death or
       confiscation.<a id="footnotetag263"
       name="footnotetag263"></a><a href="#footnote263"><sup>263</sup></a>
       The Kafirs and Hebrews are not at the same level of culture,
       and we miss the more abstract and monotheistic admonitions
       of the higher religion&mdash;"thou shalt not covet; thou
       shalt worship no other gods before me"&mdash;but the
       intelligence shown by the social mind in adjusting the
       individual to society may fairly be called the same grade of
       intelligence in the two cases.</p>

    <p>When the environmental life of two groups is more alike and
    the general cultural conditions more correspondent, the
    parallelism of thought and practice becomes more striking. The
    recently discovered Assyrian Code of Hammurabi (about 2500
    B.C.) contains striking correspondences with the Mosaic code;
    and while Semitic scholars probably have good and sufficient
    reasons for holding that the Mosaic Code was strongly
    influenced by the Assyrian, we may yet be very confident that
    the two codes would have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"
       id="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span> been of the same general
       character if no influence whatever had passed from one to
       the other.</p>

    <p>The institutions and practices of a people are a product of
    the mind; and if the early and spontaneous products of mind are
    everywhere of the same general pattern as the later
    manifestations, only less developed, refined, and specialized,
    it may well be that failure to progress equally is not due to
    essential unlikeness of mind, but to conditions lying outside
    the mind.</p>

    <p>Another test of mental ability which deserves special notice
    is mechanical ingenuity. Our white pre-eminence owes much to
    this faculty, and the lower races are reckoned defective in it.
    But the lower races do invent, and it is doubtful whether one
    invention is ever much more difficult than another. On the
    psychological side, an invention means that the mind sees a
    roundabout way of reaching an end when it cannot be reached
    directly. It brings into play the associative memory, and
    involves the recognition of analogies. There is a certain
    likeness between the flying back of a bough in one's face and
    the rebound of a bow, between a serpent's tooth and a poisoned
    arrow, between floating timber and a raft or boat; and water,
    steam, and electricity <span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"
       id="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span> are like a horse in one
       respect&mdash;they will all make wheels go around, and do
       work.</p>

    <p>Now, the savage had this faculty of seeing analogies and
    doing things in indirect ways. With the club, knife, and sword
    he struck more effectively than with the fist; with hooks,
    traps, nets, and pitfalls he understood how to seize game more
    surely than with the hands; in the bow and arrow, spear,
    blow-gun, and spring-trap he devised motion swifter than that
    of his own body; he protected himself with armor imitated from
    the hides and scales of animals, and turned their venom back on
    themselves. That the savage should have originated the
    inventive process and carried it on systematically is, indeed,
    more wonderful than that his civilized successors should
    continue the process; for every beginning is difficult.</p>

    <p>When occupations become specialized and one set of men has
    continually to do with one and only one set of machinery and
    forces, the constant play of attention over the limited field
    naturally results in improvements and the introduction of new
    principles. Modern inventions are magnificent and seem quite to
    overshadow the simpler devices of primitive times; but when we
    consider the precedents, copies, resources,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page279"
       id="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span> and accumulated knowledge
       with which the modern investigator works, and, on the other
       hand, the resourcelessness of primitive man in materials,
       ideas, and in the inventive habit itself, I confess that the
       bow and arrow seems to me the most wonderful invention in
       the world.</p>

    <p>Viewing the question from a different angle, we find another
    argument for the homogeneous character of the human mind in the
    fact that the patterns of interest of the civilized show no
    variation from those of the savage. Not only the appetites and
    vanities remain essentially the same, but, on the side of
    intellectual interest, the type of mental reaction fixed in the
    savage by the food-quest has come down unaltered to the man of
    science as well as to the man of the street. In circumventing
    enemies and capturing game, both the attention and the organic
    processes worked together in primitive man under great stress
    and strain. Whenever, indeed, a strain is thrown on the
    attention, the heart and organs of respiration are put under
    pressure also in their effort to assist the attention in
    manipulating the problem; and these organic fluctuations are
    felt as pleasure and pain. The strains thrown on the attention
    of primitive man were connected with his struggle for life; and
    not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page280"
       id="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span> only in the actual
       encounter with men and animals did emotion run high, but the
       memory and anticipation of conflict reinstated the emotional
       conditions in those periods when he was meditating future
       conflicts and preparing his bows and arrows, traps and
       poisons. The problem of invention, the reflective and
       scientific side of his life, was suffused with interest,
       because the manufacture of the weapon was, psychologically
       speaking, a part of the fight.</p>

    <p>This type of interest, originating in the hunt, remains
    dominant in the mind down to the present time. Once constructed
    to take an interest in the hunting problem, it takes an
    interest in any problem whatever. Not only do hunting and
    fighting and all competitive games&mdash;which are of precisely
    the same psychological pattern as the hunt and
    fight&mdash;remain of perennial interest, but all the useful
    occupations are interesting in just the degree that this
    pattern is preserved. The man of science works at problems and
    uses his ingenuity in making an engine in the laboratory in the
    same way that primitive man used his mind in making a trap. So
    long as the problem is present, the interest is sustained; and
    the interest ceases when the problematical is removed.
    Consequently, all modern occupations
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"
       id="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span> of the hunting
       pattern&mdash;scientific investigation, law, medicine, the
       organization of business, trade speculation, and the arts
       and crafts&mdash;are interesting as a game; while those
       occupations into which the division of labor enters to the
       degree that the workman is not attempting to control a
       problem, and in which the same acts are repeated an
       indefinite number of times, lose interest and become
       extremely irksome.</p>

    <p>This means that the brain acts pleasurably on the principle
    it was made up to act on in the most primitive times, and the
    rest is a burden. There is no brain change, but the social
    changes have been momentous; and the brain of each generation
    is brought into contact with new traditions, inhibitions,
    copies, obligations, problems, so that the run of attention and
    content of consciousness are different. Social suggestion works
    marvels in the manipulation of the mind; but the change is not
    in the brain as an organ; it is rather in the character of the
    stimulations thrust on it by society.</p>

    <p>The child begins as a savage, and after we have brought to
    bear all the influence of home, school, and church to socialize
    him, we speak as though his nature had changed organically, and
    institute a parallelism between the child and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page282"
       id="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span> the race, assuming that the
       child's brain passes in a recapitulatory way through phases
       of development corresponding to epochs in the history of the
       race. I have no doubt myself that this theory of
       recapitulation is largely a misapprehension. A stream of
       social influence is turned loose on the child; and if the
       attention to him is incessant and wise, and the copies he
       has are good and stimulating, he is molded nearer to the
       heart's desire. Sometimes he escapes, and becomes a
       criminal, tramp, sport, or artist; and even if made into an
       impeccable and model citizen, he periodically breaks away
       from the network of social habit and goes a-fishing.</p>

    <p>The fundamental explanation of the difference in the mental
    life of two groups is not that the capacity of the brain to do
    work is different, but that the attention is not in the two
    cases stimulated and engaged along the same lines. Wherever
    society furnishes copies and stimulations of a certain kind, a
    body of knowledge and a technique, practically all its members
    are able to work on the plan and scale in vogue there, and
    members of an alien race who become acquainted in a real sense
    with the system can work under it. But when society does not
    furnish the stimulations, or when it has
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page283"
       id="page283"></a>[pg 283]</span> preconceptions which tend
       to inhibit the run of attention in given lines, then the
       individual shows no intelligence in these lines. This may be
       illustrated in the fields of scientific and artistic
       interest. Among the Hebrews a religious
       inhibition&mdash;"thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
       image"&mdash;was sufficient to prevent anything like the
       sculpture of the Greeks; and the doctrine of the
       resurrection of the body in the early Christian church, and
       the teaching that man was made in the image of God, formed
       an almost insuperable obstacle to the study of human
       anatomy.</p>

    <p>The Mohammedan attitude toward scientific interest is
    represented by the following extracts from a letter from an
    oriental official to a western inquirer, printed by Sir Austen
    Henry Layard:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>My Illustrious Friend and Joy of my Liver:</i></p>

        <p>The thing which you ask of me is both difficult and
        useless. Although I have passed all my days in this place,
        I have neither counted the houses nor inquired into the
        number of the inhabitants; and as to what one person loads
        on his mules and the other stows away in the bottom of his
        ship, that is no business of mine. But above all, as to the
        previous history of this city, God only knows the amount of
        dirt and confusion that the infidels may have eaten before
        the coming of the sword of Islam. It were unprofitable for
        us to inquire into it.... Listen, O
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page284"
           id="page284"></a>[pg 284]</span> my son! There is no
           wisdom equal to the belief in God! He created the world,
           and shall we liken ourselves unto him in seeking to
           penetrate into the mysteries of his creation? Shall we
           say, Behold this star spinneth round that star, and this
           other star with a tail goeth and cometh in so many
           years? Let it go! He from whose hand it came will guide
           and direct it.... Thou art learned in the things I care
           not for, and as for that which thou hast seen, I spit
           upon it. Will much knowledge create thee a double belly,
           or wilt thou seek paradise with thine eyes?...</p>

    <p>The works of Sir Henry Maine, who gained by his long
    residence in India a profound insight into the oriental
    character, frequently point out that the eastern pride in
    conservatisms is quite as real as the western pride in
    progress:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Vast populations, some of them with a civilization
        considerable but peculiar, detest that which in the
        language of the West would be called reform. The entire
        Mohammedan world detests it. The multitudes of colored men
        who swarm in the great continent of Africa detest it, and
        it is detested by that large part of mankind which we are
        accustomed to leave on one side as barbarous or savage. The
        millions upon millions of men who fill the Chinese Empire
        loathe it and (what is more) despise it.... There are few
        things more remarkable,
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page285"
           id="page285"></a>[pg 285]</span> and in their way more
           instructive, than the stubborn incredulity and disdain
           which a man belonging to the cultivated part of Chinese
           society opposes to the vaunts of western civilization
           which he frequently hears.... There is in India a
           minority, educated at the feet of English politicians
           and in books saturated with English political ideas,
           which has learned to repeat their language; but it is
           doubtful whether even these, if they had a voice in the
           matter, would allow a finger to be laid on the very
           subjects with which European legislation is beginning to
           concern itself&mdash;social and religious usage. There
           is not, however, the shadow of a doubt that the enormous
           mass of the Indian population hates and dreads
           change.<a id="footnotetag265"
           name="footnotetag265"></a><a href="#footnote265"><sup>265</sup></a></p>

        <p>To the fact that the enthusiasm for change is
        comparatively rare must be added the fact that it is
        extremely modern. It is known but to a small part of
        mankind, and to that part but for a short period during a
        history of incalculable length.<a id="footnotetag266"
           name="footnotetag266"></a><a href="#footnote266"><sup>266</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The oriental attitude does not argue a lack of brain power,
    but a prepossession hostile to scientific inquiry. The society
    represented does not interest its members in what, from the
    western standpoint, is knowledge.</p>

    <p>The Chinese afford a fine example of a people of great
    natural ability letting their intelligence run to waste from
    lack of a scientific standpoint. As indicated above, they are
    not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page286"
       id="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span> defective in brain weight,
       and their application to study is long continued and very
       severe; but their attention is directed to matters which
       cannot possibly make them wise from the occidental
       standpoint. They learn no mathematics and no science, but
       spend years in copying the poetry of the T'ang Dynasty, in
       order to learn the Chinese characters, and in the end cannot
       write the language correctly, because many modern characters
       are not represented in this ancient poetry. Their attention
       to Chinese history is great, as befits their reverence for
       the past; but they do not organize their knowledge, they
       have no adequate textbooks or apparatus for study, and they
       make no clear distinction between fact and fiction. In
       general, they learn only rules and no principles, and rely
       on memory without the aid of reason, with the result that
       the man who stops studying often forgets everything, and the
       professional student is amazingly ignorant in the line of
       his own work:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Multitudes of Chinese scholars know next to nothing
        about matters directly in the line of their studies, and in
        regard to which we should consider ignorance positively
        disgraceful. A venerable teacher remarked to the writer
        with a charming naïveté that he had never understood the
        allusions in the Trimetrical Classic (which stands at the
        very threshold of Chinese study) until at the age
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page287"
           id="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span> of sixty he had an
           opportunity to read a Universal History prepared by a
           missionary, in which for the first time Chinese history
           was made accessible to him.<a id="footnotetag267"
           name="footnotetag267"></a><a href="#footnote267"><sup>267</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Add to this that the whole of their higher learning,
    corresponding to our university system, consists in writing
    essays and always more essays on the Chinese classics, and "it
    is impossible," as Mr. Smith points out, "not to marvel at the
    measure of success which has attended the use of such materials
    in China."<a id="footnotetag268"
       name="footnotetag268"></a><a href="#footnote268"><sup>268</sup></a>
       But when this people is in possession of the technique of
       the western world&mdash;a logic, general ideas, and
       experimentation&mdash;we cannot reasonably doubt that they
       will be able to work the western system as their cousins,
       the Japanese, are doing, and perhaps they, too, may better
       the instruction.</p>

    <p>White effectiveness is probably due to a superior technique
    acting in connection with a superior body of knowledge and
    sentiment. Of two groups having equal mental endowment, one may
    outstrip the other by the mere dominance of incident. It is a
    notorious fact that the course of human history has been
    largely without prevision or direction. Things have drifted and
    forces have arisen. Under these conditions an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page288"
       id="page288"></a>[pg 288]</span> unusual incident&mdash;the
       emergence of a great mind or a forcible personality, or the
       operation of influences as subtle as those which determine
       fashions in dress&mdash;may establish social habits and
       duties which will give a distinct character to the modes of
       attention and mental life of the group. The most significant
       fact for Aryan development is the emergence among the Greeks
       of a number of eminent men who developed logic, the
       experimental method, and philosophic interest, and fixed in
       their group the habit of looking behind the incident for the
       general law. Mediaeval attention was diverted from these
       lines by a religious movement, and the race lost for a time
       the key to progress and got clean away from the Greek
       copies; but it found them again and took a fresh start with
       the revival of Greek learning. It is quite possible to make
       a fetish of classical learning; but Sir Henry Maine's
       remark, that nothing moves in the modern world that is not
       Greek in its origin, is quite just.</p>

    <p>The real variable is the individual, not the race. In the
    beginning&mdash;perhaps as the result of a mutation or series
    of mutations&mdash;a type of brain developed which has remained
    relatively fixed in all times and among all races. This brain
    will never have any faculty in addition to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page289"
       id="page289"></a>[pg 289]</span> what it now possesses,
       because as a type of structure it is as fixed as the species
       itself, and is indeed a mark of species. It is not apparent
       either that we are greatly in need of another faculty, or
       that we could make use of it even if by a chance mutation it
       should emerge, since with the power of abstraction we are
       able to do any class of work we know anything about.
       Moreover, the brain is less likely to make a leap now than
       in earlier time, both because the conditions of nature are
       more fixed or more nearly controlled by man, and hence the
       urgency of adjustment to sharp variations in external
       conditions is removed, and because the struggle for
       existence has been mitigated so that the unfit survive along
       with the fit. Indeed, the rapid increase in idiocy and
       insanity shown by statistics indicates that the brain is
       deteriorating slightly, <i>on the average</i>, as compared
       with earlier times.<a id="footnotetag269"
       name="footnotetag269"></a><a href="#footnote269"><sup>269</sup></a></p>

    <p>Nature is not producing a better average brain than in the
    time of Aristotle and the Greeks. If we have more than the
    wisdom of our ancestors, our advantage lies in our
    specialization, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"
       id="page290"></a>[pg 290]</span> our superior body of
       knowledge, and our superior technique for its transmission.
       At the same time, the individual brain is unstable,
       fluctuating in normal persons between 1,100 and 1,500 grams
       in weight, while the extremes of variation are represented,
       on the one side, by the imbecile with 300 grams, and the man
       of genius with 2,000 on the other. It is therefore perfectly
       true that by artificial selection&mdash;Mr. Galton's
       "eugenism"&mdash;a larger average brain could be created,
       and also a higher average of natural intelligence, whether
       this be absolutely dependent on brain weight or not. But it
       is hardly to be expected that a stable brain above the
       capacity of those of the first rank now and in the past will
       result, since the mutations of nature are more radical than
       the breeding process of man, and she probably ran the whole
       gamut. "Great men lived before Agamemnon," and individual
       variations will continue to occur, but not on a different
       pattern; and what has been true in the past will happen
       again in the future, that the group which by hook or by
       crook comes into possession of the best technique and the
       best copies will make the best show of intelligence and
       march at the head of
       civilization.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291"

    <h3>III</h3>

    <p>The foregoing examination of the relation of the mental
    faculty of the lower races to the higher places us in a
    position to examine to better advantage the other question of
    the relation of the intelligence of woman to that of man.</p>

    <p>The differences in mental expression between the lower and
    the higher races can be expressed for the most part in terms of
    attention and practice. The differences in run of attention and
    practice are in this case due to the development of different
    habits by groups occupying different habitats, and consequently
    having no copies in common. Woman, on the other hand, exists in
    the white man's world of practical and scientific activity, but
    is excluded from full participation in it. Certain organic
    conditions and historical incidents have, in fact, inclosed her
    in habits which she neither can nor will fracture, and have
    also set up in the mind of man an attitude toward her which
    renders her almost as alien to man's interests and practices as
    if she were spatially separated from them.</p>

    <p>One of the most important facts which stand out in a
    comparison of the physical traits of men and women is that man
    is a more specialized <span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"
       id="page292"></a>[pg 292]</span> instrument for motion,
       quicker on his feet, with a longer reach, and fitted for
       bursts of energy; while woman has a greater fund of stored
       energy and is consequently more fitted for endurance. The
       development of intelligence and motion have gone along side
       by side in all animal forms. Through motion chances and
       experiences are multiplied, the whole equilibrium
       characterizing the stationary form is upset, and the organs
       of sense and the intelligence are developed to take note of
       and manipulate the outside world. Amid the recurrent dangers
       incident to a world peopled with moving and predacious
       forms, two attitudes may be assumed&mdash;that of fighting,
       and that of fleeing or hiding. As between the two,
       concealment and evasion became more characteristic of the
       female, especially among mammals, where the young are
       particularly helpless and need protection for a long period.
       She remained, therefore, more stationary, and at the same
       time acquired more cunning, than the male.</p>

    <p>In mankind especially, the fact that woman had to rely on
    cunning and the protection of man rather than on swift motion,
    while man had a freer range of motion and adopted a fighting
    technique, was the starting-point of a differentiation in the
    habits and interests, which had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"
       id="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span> a profound effect on the
       consciousness of each. Man's most immediate, most
       fascinating, and most remunerative occupation was the
       pursuit of animal life. The pursuit of this stimulated him
       to the invention of devices for killing and capture; and
       this aptitude for invention was later extended to the
       invention of tools and of mechanical devices in general, and
       finally developed into a settled habit of scientific
       interest. The scientific imagination which characterizes man
       in contrast with women is not a distinctive male trait, but
       represents a constructive habit of attention associated with
       freer movement and the pursuit of evasive animal forms. The
       problem of control was more difficult, and the means of
       securing it became more indirect, mediated, reflective, and
       inventive; that is, more intelligent.</p>

    <p>Woman's activities, on the other hand, were largely limited
    to plant life, to her children, and to manufacture, and the
    stimulation to mental life and invention in connection with
    these was not so powerful as in the case of man. Her inventions
    were largely processes of manufacture connected with her
    handling of the by-products of the chase. So simple a matter,
    therefore, as relatively unrestricted motion on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page294"
       id="page294"></a>[pg 294]</span> the part of man and
       relatively restricted motion on the part of woman determined
       the occupations of each, and these occupations in turn
       created the characteristic mental life of each. In man this
       was constructive, answering to his varied experience and the
       need of controlling a moving environment; and in woman it
       was conservative, answering to her more stationary and
       monotonous condition.</p>

    <p>In early times man's superior physical force, the wider
    range of his experience, his mechanical inventions in
    connection with hunting and fighting, and his combination under
    leadership with his comrades to carry out their common
    enterprises, resulted in a contempt for the weakness of women
    and an almost complete separation in interest between himself
    and the women of the group. The men frequently formed clubs,
    and lived apart from the women; and even where this did not
    happen, the men and women had no mental life in common. To this
    contempt for women also was added a superstitious fear of them,
    growing out of the primitive belief that weakness or any other
    bad quality is infectious, and may be transferred by physical
    contact or association.<a id="footnotetag270"
       name="footnotetag270"></a><a href="#footnote270"><sup>270</sup></a></p><span class="pagenum">
    <a name="page295"
       id="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span>

    <p>From Mr. Crawley's excellent paper on "Sexual Taboo" I
    transcribe the following illustrations of this attitude:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>In New Caledonia you rarely see men and women talking or
        sitting together. The women seem perfectly content with the
        company of their own sex. The men who loiter about with
        spears in most lazy fashion are seldom seen in the society
        of the opposite sex.... The Ojebwey, Peter Jones, thus
        writes of his own people: "I have scarcely ever seen
        anything like social intercourse between husband and wife,
        and it is remarkable that the women say little in the
        presence of the men." The Zulus regard their women with a
        haughty contempt. If a man were going to the bush to cut
        firewood with his wives, he and they would take different
        paths, and neither go nor return in company. If he were
        going to visit a neighbor and wished his wife to go also,
        she would follow at a distance. In Senegambia the women
        live by themselves, rarely with their husbands, and their
        sex is virtually a clique. In Egypt a man never converses
        with his wife, and in the tomb they are separated by a
        wall, though males and females are not usually buried in
        the same vault.<a id="footnotetag271"
           name="footnotetag271"></a><a href="#footnote271"><sup>271</sup></a></p>

        <p>Amongst the Dacotas custom and superstition ordain that
        the wife must carefully keep away from all that
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page296"
           id="page296"></a>[pg 296]</span> belongs to her
           husband's sphere of action. The Bechuanas never allow
           their women to touch their cattle; accordingly the men
           have to plow themselves.... In Guiana no woman may go
           near the hut where <i>ourali</i> is made. In the
           Marquesas Islands the use of canoes is prohibited to the
           female sex by <i>tabu</i>: the breaking of the rule is
           punished with death. Conversely, amongst the same people
           <i>tapa</i>-making belongs exclusively to the women:
           when they are making it for their own headdresses it is
           <i>tabu</i> for the men to touch it. In Nicaragua all
           the marketing was done by the women. A man might not
           enter the market nor even see the proceedings at the
           risk of a beating.... In Samoa where the manufacture of
           cloth is allotted solely to the women, it is a
           degradation for a man to engage in any detail of the
           process.... An Eskimo thinks it an indignity to row in
           an <i>umiak</i>, the large boat used by women. The
           different offices of husband and wife are also clearly
           distinguished; for example, when he has brought his
           booty to land it would be a stigma on his character if
           he so much as drew a seal ashore, and generally it is
           regarded as scandalous for a man to interfere with what
           is the work of women. In British Guiana cooking is the
           province of the women, as elsewhere; on one occasion
           when the men were compelled perforce to bake some bread
           they were only persuaded to do so with the utmost
           difficulty, and were ever after pointed at as old
           women.<a id="footnotetag272"
           name="footnotetag272"></a><a href="#footnote272"><sup>272</sup></a></p>

        <p>Amongst the Barea, man and wife seldom share the same
        bed; the reason they give is that the breath of the wife
        weakens the husband.... The Khyoungthas
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"
           id="page297"></a>[pg 297]</span> have a legend of a man
           who reduced a king and his men to a condition of
           feebleness by persuading them to dress up as women and
           perform female duties. When they had thus been rendered
           effeminate they were attacked and defeated without a
           blow.... Contempt for female timidity has caused a
           curious custom amongst the Gallas: they amputate the
           mammae of the boys soon after birth, believing that no
           warrior can possibly be brave who possesses them, and
           that they should belong to women only.... Amongst the
           Lhoosais when a man is unable to do his work, whether
           through laziness, cowardice or bodily incapacity, he is
           dressed in women's clothes and has to associate and work
           with the women. Amongst the Pomo Indians of California,
           when a man becomes too infirm for a warrior he is made a
           menial and assists the squaws.... When the Delawares
           were denationized by the Iroquois and prohibited from
           going to war they were according to the Indian notion
           "made women," and were henceforth to confine themselves
           to the pursuits appropriate to
           women.<a id="footnotetag273"

    <p>Women were still further degraded by the development of
    property and its control by man, together with the habit of
    treating her as a piece of property, whose value was enhanced
    if its purity was assured and demonstrable. As a result of this
    situation, man's chief concern in women became an interest in
    securing the finest specimens for his own use, in guarding them
    with jealous care from contact with other men,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"
       id="page298"></a>[pg 298]</span> and in making them,
       together with the ornaments they wore, signs of his wealth
       and social standing. The instances below are extreme ones,
       taken from lower social stages than our own, but they differ
       only in degree from the chaperonage of modern Europe:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I heard from a teacher about some strange custom
        connected with some of the young girls here [New Ireland],
        so I asked the chief to take me to the house where they
        were. The house was about twenty-five feet in length and
        stood in a reed and bamboo enclosure, across the entrance
        of which a bundle of dried grass was suspended to show that
        it was strictly <i>tabu</i>. Inside the house there were
        three conical structures about seven or eight feet in
        height, and about ten or twelve feet in circumference at
        the bottom, and for about four feet from the ground, at
        which point they tapered off to a point at the top. These
        cages were made of the broad leaves of the pandanus tree,
        sewn quite close together so that no light, and little or
        no air could enter. On one side of each is an opening which
        is closed by a double door of plaited cocoanut tree and
        pandanus tree leaves. About three feet from the ground
        there is a stage of bamboos which forms the floor. In each
        of these cages, we were told there was a young woman
        confined, each of whom had to remain for at least four or
        five years without ever being allowed to go outside the
        house. I could scarcely credit the story when I heard it;
        the whole thing seemed too horrible to be true. I spoke to
        the chief and told him that I wished to see the inside of
        the cages, and also to see the girls that I might make them
        a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"
           id="page299"></a>[pg 299]</span> present of a few
           beads.... [A girl having been allowed to come out] I
           then went to inspect the inside of the cage out of which
           she had come, but could scarcely put my head inside of
           it, the atmosphere was so hot and stifling. It was clean
           and contained nothing but a few short lengths of bamboo
           for holding water. There was only room for the girl to
           sit or lie down in a crouched position on the bamboo
           platform, and when the doors are shut it must be nearly
           or quite dark inside. They are never allowed to come out
           except once a day to bathe in a dish or wooden bowl
           placed close to the cage. They say that they perspire
           profusely. They are placed in these stifling cages when
           quite young, and must remain there until they are young
           women, when they are taken out and have each a great
           marriage feast prepared for them. One of them was about
           fourteen or fifteen years old, and the chief told me
           that she had been there for five years, but would soon
           be taken out now. The other two were about eight and ten
           years old, and they have to stay there for several years
           longer. I asked if they never died, but they said
           "No."<a id="footnotetag274"
           name="footnotetag274"></a><a href="#footnote274"><sup>274</sup></a></p>

        <p>They [the Azande] are extremely jealous of their
        womenfolk, whom they do not permit to live in the same
        village with themselves. The women's village is generally
        in the bush, about 200 yards or so distant from that of the
        chief. Women are never seen in an Azande village, the
        pathway to their own being kept secret from all outsiders.
        This system while being something like that observed by the
        Arabs, has the important distinction
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"
           id="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span> that the women are not
           shut up. They are free to come and go and do what they
           like, except visit the men's village. In common with the
           entire native population of Central Africa, the custom
           among the Zande is that the men do no work that is not
           connected with the chase or the manufacture of
           implements. All agriculture is carried on by the
           women.<a id="footnotetag275"

        <p>From the time of engagement until marriage a young lady
        is required to maintain the strictest seclusion. Whenever
        friends call upon her parents she is expected to retire to
        the inner apartments, and in all her actions and words
        guard her conduct with careful solicitude. She must use a
        close sedan whenever she visits her relations, and in her
        intercourse with her brothers and the domestics in the
        household maintain great reserve. Instead of having any
        opportunity to form those friendships and acquaintances
        with her own sex which among ourselves become a source of
        much pleasure at the time and advantage in after life, the
        Chinese maiden is confined to the circle of her relations
        and her immediate neighbors. She has few of the pleasing
        remembrances and associations that are usually connected
        with school-day life, nor has she often the ability or
        opportunity to correspond by letter with girls of her own
        age. Seclusion at this time of life, and the custom of
        crippling the feet, combine to confine women in the house
        almost as much as the strictest laws against their
        appearing abroad; for in girlhood, as they know only a few
        persons except relatives, and can make very few
        acquaintances after marriage
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page301"
           id="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span> their circle of friends
           contracts rather than enlarges as life goes on. This
           privacy impels girls to learn as much of the world as
           they can, and among the rich their curiosity is
           gratified through maid-servants, match-makers, peddlers,
           visitors, and others.<a id="footnotetag276"

    <p>The world of white civilization is intellectually rich
    because it has amassed a rich fund of general ideas, and has
    organized these into specialized bodies of knowledge, and has
    also developed a special technique for the presentation of this
    knowledge and standpoint to the young members of society, and
    for localizing their attention in special fields of interest.
    When for any reason a class of society is excluded from this
    process, as women have been historically, it must necessarily
    remain ignorant. But, while no one would make any question that
    women confined as these in New Ireland and China, as shown
    above, must have an intelligence as restricted as their mode of
    life, we are apt to lose sight altogether of the fact that
    chivalry and chaperonage and modern convention are the
    persistence of the old race habit of contempt for women, and of
    their intellectual sequestration. Men and women still form two
    distinct classes and are not in free communication with each
    other. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"
       id="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span> Not only are women unable
       and unwilling to be communicated with directly,
       unconventionally, and truly on many subjects, but men are
       unwilling to talk to them. I do not have in mind situations
       involving questions of propriety or delicacy alone, but a
       certain habit of restraint, originating doubtless in matters
       relating to sex, extends to all intercourse with women, with
       the result that they are not really admitted to the
       intellectual world of men; and there is not only a
       reluctance on the part of men to admit them, but a
       reluctance&mdash;or, rather, a real inability&mdash;on their
       part to enter. Modesty with reference to personal habits has
       become so ingrained and habitual, and to do anything freely
       is so foreign to woman, that even free thought is almost of
       the nature of an immodesty in her.</p>

    <p>In connection also with the adventitious position of woman
    referred to in another paper,<a id="footnotetag277"
       name="footnotetag277"></a><a href="#footnote277"><sup>277</sup></a>
       the feminine interests and habits are set so strongly toward
       dress and personal display that they are not readily
       diverted. Women may and do protest against the triviality of
       their lives, but emotional interests are more immediate than
       intellectual ones, and human nature does not drift into
       intellectual pursuit voluntarily, but is
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page303"
       id="page303"></a>[pg 303]</span> forced into it in
       connection with the urgency of practical activities. The
       women who are obliged to work are of the poorer classes, and
       have not that leisure and opportunity preliminary to any
       specialized acquirement; while those who have leisure are
       supported in that position both by money and by precedent
       and habit, and have no immediate stimulation to lift them
       out of it. They sometimes entertain ideas of freedom and
       plan occupational interests, but they have usually become
       thoroughly habituated to their unfreedom, and continue to
       feed from the hand.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The usual reasoning as to the ability of women also
    overlooks the fact that many women are larger and stronger than
    many men, and some of them possessed of tremendous energy,
    will, wit, endurance, and sagacity. This type appears in all
    classes of society, but more frequently in the lower classes
    and among peasants, both because the natural qualities are less
    glozed over there by aristocratic custom, and because these
    classes are bred truer to nature. Unfortunately, the attention
    of the women of these classes is limited to very immediate
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page304"
       id="page304"></a>[pg 304]</span> concerns; but, on the other
       hand, they present the true qualities of the female type,
       and few, I believe, will deny that the peasant woman
       described below would shine in intellectual walks if fate
       had called her there:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Mother was a large, stout, full-blooded woman of great
        strength. She could not read or write, and yet she was well
        thought of. There are all sorts of educations, and though
        reading and writing are very well in their way, they would
        not have done mother any good. She had the sort of
        education that was needed in her work. Nobody knew more
        about raising vegetables, ducks, chickens and pigeons than
        she did. There were some among the neighbors who could read
        and write and so thought themselves above mother, but when
        they went to market they found their mistake. Her peas,
        beans, cauliflower, cabbages, pumpkins, melons, potatoes,
        beets, and onions sold for the highest price of any, and
        that ought to show whose education was the best, because it
        is the highest education that produces the finest work.</p>

        <p>Mother used to take me frequently to the market.... The
        market women were a big, rough, fat, jolly set, who did not
        know what sickness was, and it might have been well for me
        if I had stayed among them and grown up like mother. One
        time in the market-place I saw a totally different set of
        women. It was about 8 o'clock in the morning, when some
        people began to shout: "Here come the rich Americans! Now
        we will sell things!" We saw a large party of travelers
        coming through the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page305"
           id="page305"></a>[pg 305]</span> crowd. They looked very
           queer. Their clothes seemed queer, as they were so
           different from ours. They wore leather boots instead of
           wooden shoes, and they all looked weak and pale. The
           women were tall and thin, like beanpoles, and their
           shoulders were stooped and narrow; most of them wore
           glasses or spectacles, showing that their eyes were
           weak. The corners of their mouths were all pulled down,
           and their faces were crossed and crisscrossed with lines
           and wrinkles, as though they were carrying all the care
           of the world. Our women all began to laugh and dance and
           shout at the strangers.... The sight of these people
           gave me my first idea of America. I heard that the women
           there never worked, laced themselves too tightly, and
           were always ill.<a id="footnotetag278"
           name="footnotetag278"></a><a href="#footnote278"><sup>278</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The French dressmaker who wrote this passage has the true
    idea of education and of mind. The mind is an organ for
    controlling the environment, and it is a safe general principle
    that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page306"
       id="page306"></a>[pg 306]</span> the mind which shows high
       power in the manipulation of a simple situation will show
       the same quality of efficiency in a more complex one.</p>

    <p>The savage, the peasant, the poor man, and woman are not
    what we call intellectual, because they are not taught to know
    and manipulate the materials of knowledge. The savage is
    outside the process from geographical reasons; the peasant is
    not in the center of interest; the poor man's needs are
    pressing, and do not permit of interests of a mediate
    character; and woman does not participate because it is neither
    necessary nor womanly.</p>

    <p>Even the most serious women of the present day stand, in any
    work they undertake, in precisely the same relation to men that
    the amateur stands to the professional in games. They may be
    desperately interested and may work to the limit of endurance
    at times; but, like the amateur, they got into the game late,
    and have not had a life-time of practice, or they do not have
    the advantage of that pace gained only by competing incessantly
    with players of the very first rank. No one will contend that
    the amateur in billiards has a nervous organization less fitted
    to the game than the professional; it is admitted that the
    difference lies in the constant practice
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page307"
       id="page307"></a>[pg 307]</span> of the professional, the
       more exacting standards prevailing in the professional
       ranks, and constant play in "fast company." A group of women
       would make a sorry spectacle in competition with a set of
       men who made billiards their life-work. But how sad a
       spectacle the eminent philosophers of the world would make
       in the same competition!</p>

    <p>Scientific pursuits and the allied intellectual occupations
    are a game which women have entered late, and their lack of
    practice is frequently mistaken for lack of natural ability.
    Writing some years ago of the women in his classes at the
    University of Zürich, Professor Carl Vogt said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>At lectures the young women are models of attention and
        application; perhaps they even make too great effort to
        carry home in black and white what they have heard. They
        generally sit in the front seats, because they register
        early, and, moreover, because they come early, long before
        the lecture begins. But it is noticeable that they give
        only a superficial glance at the preparations which the
        professor passes around. Sometimes they pass them to their
        neighbor without even looking at them; a longer examination
        would prevent their taking notes.</p>

        <p>On examination the conduct of the young women is the
        same as during the lectures. They know better than the
        young men. To employ a classroom expression, they
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page308"
           id="page308"></a>[pg 308]</span> are enormously crammed.
           Their memory is good, so that they know perfectly how to
           give the answer to the question which is put. But
           generally they stop there. An indirect question makes
           them lose the thread. As soon as the examiner appeals to
           individual reason, the examination is over; they do not
           answer. The examiner seeks to make the sense of the
           question clearer, and uses a word, perhaps, which is in
           the manuscript of the student, when, pop! the thing goes
           as if you had pressed the button of a telephone. If the
           examination consisted solely in written or oral replies
           to questions on subjects which have been treated in the
           lectures or which could be read up on in the manuals,
           the ladies would always secure brilliant results. But,
           alas! there are other practical tests in which the
           candidate finds herself face to face with reality, and
           that she cannot meet successfully unless she has done
           practical work in the laboratories, and it is there the
           shoe pinches.</p>

        <p>The respect in which laboratory work is particularly
        difficult to women&mdash;one would hardly believe
        it&mdash;is that they are often very awkward and clumsy
        with their hands. The assistants in the laboratories are
        unanimous in their complaint; they are pursued with
        questions about the most trifling things, and one woman
        gives them more trouble than three men. One would think the
        delicate fingers of these young women adapted especially to
        microscopic work, to the manipulation of small slides, to
        cutting thin sections, to making the most delicate
        preparations; the truth is quite the contrary. You can tell
        the table of a woman at a glance: from the fragments of
        glass, broken instruments, the broken scalpels, the
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page309"
           id="page309"></a>[pg 309]</span> spoiled preparations.
           There are doubtless exceptions, but they are
           exceptions.<a id="footnotetag279"
           name="footnotetag279"></a><a href="#footnote279"><sup>279</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Zürich was among the first of the European universities
    opening their doors to women, and it is particularly
    interesting to see their first efforts in connection with the
    higher learning. Without a wide experience of life, and without
    practice in constructive thinking, they naturally fell back on
    the memory to retain a hold on results in a field with which
    they were not sufficiently trained to operate in it
    independently. It is frequently alleged, and is implied in
    Professor Vogt's report, that women are distinguished by good
    memories and poor powers of generalization. But this is to
    mistake the facts. A tenacious memory is characteristic of
    women and children, and of all persons unskilled in the
    manipulation of varied experiences in thought. But when the
    mind is able at any moment to construct a result from the raw
    materials of experience, the memory loses something of its
    tenacity and absoluteness. In this sense it may even be said
    that a good memory for details is a sign of an untrained or
    imitative mind. As the mind becomes more inventive,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"
       id="page310"></a>[pg 310]</span> the memory is less
       concerned with the details of knowledge and more with the
       knowledge of places to find the details when they are needed
       in any special problem.</p>

    <p>The awkwardness in manual manipulation shown by these girls
    was also surely due to lack of practice. The fastest typewriter
    in the world is today a woman; the record for roping steers (a
    feat depending on manual dexterity rather than physical force)
    is held by a woman; and anyone who will watch girls making
    change before the pneumatic tubes in the great department
    stores about Christmas time will experience the same wonder one
    feels on first seeing a professional gambler shuffling
    cards.</p>

    <p>In short, Professor Vogt's report on women students is just
    what was to be expected in Germany forty years ago. The
    American woman, with the enjoyment of greater liberty, has made
    an approach toward the standards of professional scholarship,
    and some individuals stand at the very top in their university
    studies and examinations. The trouble with these cases is that
    they are either swept away and engulfed by the modern system of
    marriage, or find themselves excluded in some intangible way
    from <span class="pagenum"><a name="page311"
       id="page311"></a>[pg 311]</span> association with men in the
       fullest sense, and no career open to their talents.</p>

    <p>The personal liberty of women is, comparatively speaking, so
    great in America, suggestion and copies for imitation are
    spread broadcast so copiously in the schools, newspapers,
    books, and lectures, and occupations and interests are becoming
    so varied, that a number of women of natural ability and
    character are realizing some definite aim in a perfect way. But
    these are sporadic cases, representing usually some definite
    interest rather than a full intellectual life, and resembling
    also in their nature and rarity the elevation of a peasant to a
    position of eminence in Europe. Nowhere in the world do women
    as a class lead a perfectly free intellectual life in common
    with the men of the group, unless it be in restricted and
    artificial groups like the modern revolutionary party in
    Russia.</p>

    <p>Even in America a number of the great schools are not
    coeducational, and in those which are so, many of the
    instructors claim that they do not find it possible to treat
    with the men and women on precisely the same basis, both
    because of their own mental attitude toward mixed classes and
    the inability of the women to receive such treatment.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"
       id="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span> In the case of women also
       we can say what Mr. Smith says of the Chinese and their
       system of education, that it is impossible not to marvel at
       the results they accomplish in view of the system under
       which they work.</p>

    <p>The mind and the personality are largely built up by
    suggestion from the outside, and if the suggestions are limited
    and particular, so will be the mind. The world of modern
    intellectual life is in reality a white man's world. Few women
    and perhaps no blacks have ever entered this world in the
    fullest sense. To enter it in the fullest sense would be to be
    in it at every moment from the time of birth to the time of
    death, and to absorb it unconsciously and consciously, as the
    child absorbs language. When something like this happens, we
    shall be in a position to judge of the mental efficiency of
    woman and the lower races. At present we seem justified in
    inferring that the differences in mental expression between the
    higher and lower races and between men and women are no greater
    than they should be in view of the existing differences in
    opportunity.</p>

    <p>Indeed, when we take into consideration the superior cunning
    as well as the superior endurance of women, we may even raise
    the question <span class="pagenum"><a name="page313"
       id="page313"></a>[pg 313]</span> whether their capacity for
       intellectual work is not under equal conditions greater than
       in men. Cunning is the analogue of constructive
       thought&mdash;an indirect, mediated, and intelligent
       approach to a problem&mdash;and characteristic of the
       female, in contrast with the more direct and open procedure
       of the male. Owing to the limited and personal nature of the
       activities of woman, this trait has expressed itself
       historically in womankind as intrigue rather than invention,
       but that it is very deeply based in the instincts is shown
       by the important rôle it plays in the life of the female in
       animal life. Endurance is also a factor of prime importance
       in intellectual performance, for here as in business life
       "it is doggedness as does it;" and if woman's endurance and
       natural ingenuity were combined in intellectual pursuits, it
       might prove that the gray mare is the better horse in this
       field as well as in peasant life. The most serious
       objection, also, to the view that woman is fitted to do
       continuous and hard work, arises from her relation to
       child-bearing; but this is at bottom trivial. The period of
       child-bearing is not only not continuous through life, but
       it is not serious from the standpoint of the time lost. No
       work is without interruption, and child-birth
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page314"
       id="page314"></a>[pg 314]</span> is an incident in the life
       of normal woman of no more significance, when viewed in the
       aggregate and from the standpoint of time, than the
       interruption of the work of men by their in-and out-of-door
       games. The important point in all work is not to be
       uninterrupted, but to begin again.</p>

    <p>Whether the characteristic mental life of women and the
    lower races will prove to be identical with those of the white
    man or different in quality is a different question, and
    problematical. It is certain, at any rate, that our
    civilization is not of the highest type possible. In all our
    relations there is too much of primitive man's fighting
    instinct and technique; and it is not impossible that the
    participation of woman and the lower races will contribute new
    elements, change the stress of attention, disturb the
    equilibrium, and force a crisis which will result in the
    reconstruction of our habits on more sympathetic and equitable
    principles. Certain it is that no civilization can remain the
    highest if another civilization adds to the intelligence of its
    men the intelligence of its women.</p>

        <p>Food affords the basis for metabolic changes in the
        parent organism, but it is probable that food is less
        <i>directly</i> related than heat and light to the
        determination of sex. Sachs, whose experiments must be
        given the greatest possible weight, has determined that the
        ultra-violet rays of light are necessary to the chemical
        changes essential to the formation of the reproductive
        organs. (J. Sachs, "Ueber die Wirkung der ultravioletten
        Strahlen auf die Blüthenbildung," <i>Gesammelte
        Abhandlungen über Pflanzen-Physiologie</i>, Vol. I, pp.
        293ff.) More recently, Klebs has shown that by diminishing
        the intensity of light the development of female sex organs
        in ferns can be interrupted, so that, in spite of the
        presence of male organs, fertilization is impossible; at
        the same time, the prothallia are enabled in weak light to
        grow feebly and to put out small asexual processes, which
        in the presence of bright light become normal prothallia.
        Similarly, the development of sexual organs in algae is
        dependent on a certain intensity of light, and the plant
        remains sterile if the light is diminished below a certain
        point. (G. Klebs, <i>Ueber einige Probleme der Physiologie
        der Fortpflanzung</i>, pp. 13-16.)</p>

        <p>Maupas, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 358. Later investigations
        have tended to discredit Maupas' experiments as a whole by
        showing that the Infusorians with which he experimented can
        be kept alive indefinitely by a change of diet, without the
        aid of sexual conjugation. This merely confirms the view,
        however, that abundant nutrition and crossing are alike
        favorable to health: "We must admire the skill of the
        investigator who was able to keep his colonies alive for
        months and years under such artificial conditions, but we
        may venture to doubt whether the fate of extinction which
        did ultimately overtake them was really due to the absence
        of conjugation, and not to the unnaturalness of the
        conditions." A. Weismann, <i>The Evolution of Theory</i>,
        Vol. I, p. 329.</p>

        <p>Since the above was written, Calkins has made a series
        of new experiments, the results of which differed in
        several respects from those yielded by Maupas' experiments.
        When his infusorian cultures began to grow weaker, as
        happened frequently and at irregular intervals, he was
        always able to restore them to more vigorous life by a
        change of diet, and especially by substituting grated meat,
        liver, and the like for infusions of hay. Certain salts
        too, had the same effect; the animals became perfectly
        vigorous again. Calkins believes that chemical agents, and
        especially salts, must be supplied to the protoplasm from
        time to time. He reared 620 generations of
        <i>Paramoecium</i> without conjugation. But the 620th was
        weakly and without energy. The addition of an extract of
        sheep's brains made them perfectly fresh and vigorous
        again. Further experiments in this direction are to be
        desired, but, according to those of Calkins, it is probable
        that Infusorians can continue to live for an unlimited time
        even without conjugation. (<i>Ibid.</i>, note.)</p>

        unmannerly, paper ("Variation in Man and Woman," <i>The
        Chances of Death</i>, Vol. I), has criticized some of the
        results of the physical anthropologists and attempted to
        show that the theory of the greater variability of man has
        no legs to stand on. His argument is mainly statistical,
        and affects, perhaps, some of the details of the theory,
        but not, I think, the theory as a whole.</p>

        <p>Morphological differences are less in low than in high
        races, and the less civilized the race, the less is the
        physical difference of the sexes. In the higher races the
        men are both more unlike one another than in the lower
        races, and at the same time more unlike the women of their
        own race. But, while some of these differences may probably
        be justly set down as congenital, as representing varieties
        of the species which have passed through different
        variational experiences, they are doubtless mainly due to
        the fact that the activities of men and women are more
        unlike in the higher than in the lower races.</p>

        <p>Where a large body of men are intensely interested in a
        competition, as over against a small body of women not
        seriously interested, any comparison of results is almost
        out of the question. But the superior physical strength of
        man is, I believe, disputed in no quarter. The Vassar
        records have been improved in succeeding years (the
        100-yard dash was 13 seconds in 1904, the running high jump
        4 feet 2-1/2 inches in 1905, the running broad jump 14 feet
        6-1/2 inches in 1904), but Miss Harriet Isabel Ballantine,
        director of the Vassar College Gymnasium, writes me: "I do
        not believe women can ever, no matter what the training,
        approach man in their physical achievements; and I see no
        reason why they should."</p>

        of the sexes with regard to physical strength can be
        attributed to persistent difference in training, it is
        certain that a large part of the difference is explicable
        on this ground. The great strength of savage women and the
        rapid increase in strength of civilized women wherever
        systematic physical training has been introduced both show
        the importance of this factor."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, p.

        <p>It prepares the way, however, only in the sense that it
        furnishes the mass out of which the organization arises. If
        there had been no social grouping through reproduction,
        there would yet have been ultimately filiation of men for
        the sake of mutually profitable enterprises.
        Blood-brotherhood and the treaty are devices indicating
        that early man had sufficient inventive imagination to do
        this. The tribal group may, in fact, be described as a
        fighting male organization living in a group of
        females.</p>

        <p>I have alluded in more than one paper to the theory of
        tropisms, but this does not imply an acceptance of this
        theory as stated by Loeb (<i>Der Heliotropismus der Thiere
        und seine Uebereinstimmung mil dem Heliotropismus der
        Pflanzen</i>), Vervorn (<i>Das lebendige Substanz</i>), and
        other representatives of the "mechanical" school of
        physiologists. The recent researches of Jennings seem to
        establish the view that reactions of the lower organisms to
        stimulation are less mechanical than has been assumed by
        this school. The current theory holds that "the action of
        the stimulus is directly on the motor organs of that part
        of the organism upon which the stimulus impinges, thus
        giving rise to changes in the state of contraction, which
        produce orientation." Jennings finds that "the responses to
        stimuli are usually reactions of the organisms as wholes,
        brought about by some physiological change produced by the
        stimulus.... The organism reacts as a unit, not as the sum
        of a number of independently reacting organs." H.S.

        <p>No notice is here taken of the moral content of forms of
        worship, since religious practices are to be regarded as
        reflections of social practices. Morality springs from
        human activity, and religious belief consists in positing
        human traits in spirits; but it is impossible to find in
        religious practice an element which did not before exist in
        human practice. Religion and art have a philosophical and
        an ideal side, and their representations may be regarded as
        more perfect and valid than the human models on which they
        are based, but the ground-patterns of both religion and art
        are those of human experience.</p>

        Australia, both because the natives are in a very primitive

        <p>Misapprehension as to the prevalence of marriage by
        capture is due in the main to two causes: (1) cases of
        elopement have been classed as cases of capture; (2) the
        so-called survivals of marriage by capture in historical
        times, of which so much has been made, are merely
        systematized expressions of the coyness of the female,
        differing in no essential point from the coyness of the
        female among birds at the pairing season.</p>

        blushing as due originally to "self-attention directed to
        personal appearance, in relation to the opinion of others,"
        appears to me to be a very good statement of some of the
        aspects of the process, but hardly an adequate explanation

        <p>Without making any attempt to classify the emotions, we
        may notice that they arise out of conditions connected with
        both the nutritive and reproductive activities of life; and
        it is possible to say that such emotions as anger, fear,
        and guilt show a more plain genetic connection with the
        conflict aspect of the food-process, while modesty is
        connected rather with sexual life and the attendant bodily
        habits.</p>

        <p>Groos, <i>The Play of Animals</i>, p. 285. The utility
        of these antics is well explained by Professor Ziegler in a
        letter to Professor Groos: "Among all animals a highly
        excited condition of the nervous system is necessary for
        the act of pairing, and consequently we find an exciting
        playful prelude is very generally indulged in" (Groos,
        <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 242); and Professor Groos thinks that
        the sexual hesitancy of the female is of advantage to the
        species, as preventing "too early and too frequent yielding
        to the sexual impulse" (<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 283).</p>

        <p>Old women among the natural races often lose their
        modesty because it is no longer of any use. Bonwick says

        but that the old women were not so particular on this
        point. (Bonwick, <i>The Daily Life of the Tasmanians</i>,

        <p><i>The Life Stories of Undistinguished Americans</i>
        (Edited) by Hamilton Holt, pp. 100ff.</p>

        <p>This peasant woman represents the true female type, and
        the American women in the scene represent the adventitious
        type of woman. The frail and clinging type is an adjustment
        to the tastes of man, produced partly by custom and partly
        by breeding. But in so far as the selection of frail women
        by men of the upper classes has contributed to the
        production of a frail or so-called "feminine" type in these
        classes, this applies to the males as well as the females
        of these classes. And there is, in fact, a more or less
        marked tendency to "feminism" apparent among the men and
        women of the "better classes." If we want to breed for
        mind, we can do so, but we must breed on better principles
        than beauty and docility.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
