<p>The original Story of Patsy was written and sold some seven
years ago for the benefit of the Silver Street Free Kindergartens
in San Francisco. Now that it is for the first time placed in the
hands of publishers, I have at their request added new material, so
that the present story is more than double the length of the
original brief sketch.</p>

<p>"It makes a heaven-wide difference whether the soul of the child

<p><img border="0" src="images/Illus-012.png" width="120" height=
"120" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" alt='I'>t had been a long,
wearisome day at the Free Kindergarten, and I was alone in the
silent, deserted room. Gone were all the little heads, yellow and
black, curly and smooth; the dancing, restless, curious eyes; the
too mischievous, naughty, eager hands and noisy feet; the merry
voices that had made the great room human, but now left it quiet
and empty. Eighty pairs of tiny boots had clattered down the
stairs; eighty baby woes had been relieved; eighty little torn
coats pulled on with patient hands; eighty shabby little hats, not
one with a "strawberry mark" to distinguish it from any other, had
been distributed with infinite discrimination among their
possessors; numberless sloppy kisses had been pressed upon a
willing cheek or hand, and another day was over. No,&mdash;not
quite over, after all. A murderous yell from below brought me to my
feet, and I flew like an anxious hen to my brood. One small quarrel
in the hall; very small, but it must be inquired into on the way to
the greater one. Mercedes McGafferty had taunted Jenny Crawhall
with being Irish. The fact that she herself had been born in Cork
about three years previous did not trouble her in the least. Jenny,
in a voice choked with sobs, and with the stamp of a tiny foot, was
announcing hotly that she was "NOT Irish, no sech a
thing,&mdash;she was Plesberterian!" I was not quite clear whether
this was a theological or racial controversy, but I settled it
speedily, and they ran off together hand in hand. I hastened to the
steps. The yells had come from Joe Guinee and Mike Higgins, who
were fighting for the possession of a banana; a banana, too, that
should have been fought for, if at all, many days before,&mdash;a
banana better suited, in its respectable old age, to peaceful
consumption than the fortunes of war. My unexpected apparition had
such an effect that I might have been an avenging angel. The boys
dropped the banana simultaneously, and it fell to the steps quite
exhausted, in such a condition that whoever proved to be in the
right would get but little enjoyment from it.</p>

<p>"O my boys, my boys!" I exclaimed, "did you forget so soon? What
shall we do? Must Miss Kate follow you everywhere? If that is the
only way in which you can be good, we might as well give up trying.
Must I watch you to the corner every day, no matter how tired I
am?"</p>

<p>Two grimy little shirt bosoms heaved with shame and anger; two
pairs of eyes hid themselves under protecting lids; two pairs of
moist and stained hands sought the shelter of charitable
pockets,&mdash;then the cause of war was declared by Mike
sulkily.</p>

<p>"Joe Guinee hooked my bernanner."</p>

<p>"I never!" said Joe hotly. "I swapped with him f'r a peach, 'n
he e't the peach at noon-time, 'n then wouldn't gimme no
bernanner."</p>

<p>"The peach warn't no good," Mike interpolated swiftly, seeing my
expression,&mdash;"it warn't no good, Miss Kate. When I come to eat
it I had ter chuck half of it away, 'nd then Joe Guinee went t' my
lunch bucket and hooked my bernanner!"</p>

<p>I sat down on the top step, motioned the culprits to do
likewise, and then began dispensing justice tempered with mercy for
the twenty-fifth time that day. "Mike, you say Joe took your
banana?"</p>

<p>"Yes 'm,&mdash;he hooked it."</p>

<p>"Same thing. You have your words and I have mine, and I've told
you before that mine mean just as much and sound a little better.
But I thought that you changed that banana for a peach, and ate the
peach?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Then, why wasn't that banana Joe's?&mdash;you had taken his
peach."</p>

<p>"He hadn't oughter hooked&mdash;took it out o' my bucket."</p>

<p>"No, and you ought not to have put it <i>into</i> your
bucket."</p>

<p>"He hooked&mdash;took what warn't his."</p>

<p>"You <i>kept</i> what wasn't yours. How do you expect to have a
good fruit store, either of you, by and by, and have people buy
your things, if you haven't any idea of making a good square trade?
Do try to be honest; and if you make an exchange stick to it;
fighting over a thing never makes it any better. Look at that
banana!&mdash;is it any good to either of you now?" (Pause. The
still small voice was busy, but no sound was heard save the distant
whistle of the janitor.)</p>

<p>"I could bring another one to Joe to-morrer," said Mike, looking
at his ragged boot and scratching it along the edge of the
step.</p>

<p>"I don't want yer to, 'f the peach was sour 'n you had ter chuck
it away," responded Joe amiably.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think he ought to bring the banana; he made the trade
with his eyes open, and the peach didn't look sour, for I saw you
squeezing it when you ought to have been singing your morning
hymn,&mdash;I thought you would get into trouble with it then. Now
is it all right, Mike?&mdash;that's good! And Joe, don't go poking
into other people's lunch baskets. If you hadn't done that, you
silly boy," I philosophized whimsically for my own edification,
"you would have been a victim; but you descended to the level of
your adversary, and you are now simply another little rascal."</p>

<p>We walked down the quiet, narrow street to the corner,&mdash;a
proceeding I had intended to omit that day, as it was always as
exciting as an afternoon tea, and I did not feel equal to the
social chats that would be pressed upon me by the neighborhood
"ladies." One of my good policemen was there as usual, and saluted
me profoundly. He had carried the last baby over the crossing, and
guided all the venturesome small boys through the maze of trucks
and horse-cars,&mdash;a difficult and thankless task, as they
absolutely courted decapitation,&mdash;it being an unwritten law of
conduct that each boy should weave his way through the horses' legs
if practicable, and if not, should see how near he could come to
grazing the wheels. Exactly at twelve o'clock, and again at two
each day, in rain or sunshine, a couple of huge fatherly persons in
brass buttons appeared on that corner and assisted us in getting
our youngsters into streets of safety. Nobody had ever asked them
to come, their chief had not detailed them for that special duty;
and I could never have been bold enough to suggest that a guardian
of the peace with an immaculate uniform should carry to and fro a
crowd of small urchins with dusty boots and sticky hands.</p>

<p>But everybody loved that Silver Street corner, where the quiet
little street met the larger noisy one! Not a horse-car driver but
looked at his brake and glanced up the street before he took his
car across. The truckmen all drove slowly, calling "Hi, there!"
genially to any youngster within half a block.</p>

<p>And it was a pleasant scene enough to one who had a part in it,
who was able to care for simple people, who could be glad to see
them happy, sorry to see them sad, and willing to live among them a
part of each day, and bring a little sunshine and hope into their
lives.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Donohue! All safely across?"</p>

<p>"All safe, miss! Sorry you troubled to come down, miss. I can be
depended on for this corner, miss, an' ye niver need bother yerself
about the childern after ye've once turned 'em loose, miss. An'
might I be so bold, seein' as how I might not have a better
chance&mdash;would ye be so kind as to favor me with yer last name,
miss? the truth bein' that ivery one calls ye Miss Kate, an' the
policemen of this ward is gettin' up rather a ch'ice thing in
Christmas cards to presint to ye, come Christmas, because, if ye'll
excuse the liberty, miss, they do regard you as belongin' to the
special police!"</p>

<p>I laughed, thanked him for the intended honor, which had been
mentioned to me before, and gave him my card, not without a spasm
of terror lest the entire police force should invade my
dwelling.</p>

<p>The "baker lady" across the street caught my eye, smiled, and
sent over a hot bun in a brown paper bag. The "grocery lady" called
over in a clear, ringing tone, "Would you be so kind, 'm, as to
step inside on your way 'ome and fetch 'Enry a bit of work, 'm?
'Enry 'as the 'ooping cough, 'm, and I don't know 'owever I'm goin'
to keep 'im at 'ome another day, 'm, he pines for school so!"</p>

<p>I give a nod which means, Certainly!</p>

<p>Mrs. Weiss appeared at her window above the grocery with a cloth
wound about her head; appeared, and then vanished mysteriously.
Very well, Mr. Weiss,&mdash;you know what to expect! I gave you
fair warning last time, and I shall be as good as my word! Good
heavens! Is that&mdash;it can't be&mdash;yes, it is&mdash;a new
McDonald baby at the saloon door! And there was such a superfluity
of the McDonald clan before! One more wretched little human soul
precipitated without a welcome into such a family circle as that!
It set me thinking, as I walked slowly back and toiled up the
steps. "I suppose most people would call this a hard and monotonous
life," I mused. "There is an eternal regularity in the succession
of amusing and heart-breaking incidents, but it is not monotonous,
for I am too close to all the problems that bother this workaday
world,&mdash;so close that they touch me on every side. No
missionary can come so near to these people. I am so close that I
can feel the daily throb of their need, and they can feel the throb
of my sympathy. Oh! it is work fit for a saviour of men, and
what&mdash;what can I do with it?"</p>

<p>I sank into my small rocking-chair, and, clasping my arms over
my head, bent it upon the table and closed my eyes.</p>

<p>The dazzling California sunshine streamed in at the western
windows, touched the gold-fish globes with rosy glory, glittered on
the brass bird-cages, flung a splendid halo round the meek head of
the Madonna above my table, and poured a flood of grateful heat
over my shoulders. The clatter of a tin pail outside the door, the
uncertain turning of a knob by a hand too small to grasp it: "I
forgitted my lunch bucket, 'n had to come back five blocks.
Good-by, Miss Kate." (Kiss.) "Good-by, little man; run along."
Another step, and a curly little red head pushes itself
apologetically through the open door. "You never dave me back my
string and buzzer, Miss Kate." "Here it is; leave it at home
to-morrow if you can, dear,&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>Silence again, this time continued and profound. Mrs. Weiss was
evidently not coming to-day to ask me if she should give blow for
blow in her next connubial fracas. I was thankful to be spared
until the morrow, when I should perhaps have greater strength to
attack Mr. Weiss, and see what I could do for Mrs. Pulaski's
dropsy, and find a mourning bonnet and shawl for the Gabilondo's
funeral and clothes for the new Higgins twins. (Oh, Mrs. Higgins,
would not one have sufficed you?)</p>

<p>The events of the day march through my tired brain; so tired! so
tired! and just a bit discouraged and sad too. Had I been patient
enough with the children? Had I forgiven cheerfully enough the
seventy times seven sins of omission and commission? Had I poured
out the love&mdash;bountiful, disinterested,
long-suffering&mdash;of which God shows us the measure and
fullness? Had I&mdash;But the sun dropped lower and lower behind
the dull brown hills, and exhausted nature found a momentary
forgetfulness in sleep.</p>

</div>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Illus-023.png" width="120" height=
"118" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt='S'>uddenly I was
awakened by a subdued and apologetic cough. Starting from my nap, I
sat bolt upright in astonishment, for quietly ensconced in a small
red chair by my table, and sitting still as a mouse, was the
weirdest apparition ever seen in human form. A boy,
seeming&mdash;how many years old shall I say? for in some ways he
might have been a century old when he was born&mdash;looking, in
fact, as if he had never been young, and would never grow older. He
had a shrunken, somewhat deformed body, a curious, melancholy face,
and such a head of dust-colored hair that he might have been
shocked for a door-mat. The sole redeemers of the countenance were
two big, pathetic, soft dark eyes, so appealing that one could
hardly meet their glance without feeling instinctively in one's
pocket for a biscuit or a ten-cent piece. But such a face! He had
apparently made an attempt at a toilet without the aid of a mirror,
for there was a clean circle like a race-track round his nose,
which member reared its crest, untouched and grimy, from the
centre, like a sort of judge's stand, while the dusky rim outside
represented the space for audience seats.</p>

<p>I gazed at this astonishing diagram of a countenance for a
minute, spellbound, thinking it resembled nothing so much as a
geological map, marked with coal deposits. And as for his clothes,
his jacket was ragged and arbitrarily docked at the waist, while
one of his trousers-legs was slit up at the side, and flapped
hither and thither when he moved, like a lug-sail in a calm.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said I at length, waking up to my duties as
hostess, "did you come to see me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"Let me think; I don't seem to remember; I am so sleepy. Are you
one of my little friends?"</p>

<p>"No, I hain't yit, but I'm goin' to be."</p>

<p>"That's good, and we'll begin right now, shall we?"</p>

<p>"I knowed yer fur Miss Kate the minute I seen yer."</p>

<p>"How was that, eh?"</p>

<p>"The boys said as how you was a kind o' pretty lady, with towzly
hair in front." (Shades of my cherished curls!)</p>

<p>"I'm very much obliged to the boys."</p>

<p>"Kin yer take me in?"</p>

<p>"What? Here? Into the Kindergarten?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I bin waitin' this yer long whiles fur to git in."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear little boy," gazing dubiously at his contradictory
countenance, "you're too&mdash;big, aren't you? We have only tiny
little people here, you know; not six years old. You are more,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm nine by the book; but I ain't more 'n scerce six
along o' my losing them three year."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, child? How could you <i>lose</i> three
years?" cried I, more and more puzzled by my curious visitor.</p>

<p>"I lost 'em on the back stairs, don't yer know. My father he got
fightin' mad when he was drunk, and pitched me down two flights of
'em, and my back was most clean broke in two, so I couldn't git out
o' bed forever, till just now."</p>

<p>"Why, poor child, who took care of you?"</p>

<p>"Mother she minded me when she warn't out washin'."</p>

<p>"And did she send you here to-day?"</p>

<p>"Well! however could she, bein' as how she's dead? I s'posed you
knowed that. She died after I got well; she only waited for me to
git up, anyhow."</p>

<p>O God! these poor mothers! they bite back the cry of their pain,
and fight death with love so long as they have a shred of strength
for the battle!</p>

<p>"What's your name, dear boy?"</p>

<p>"Patsy."</p>

<p>"Patsy what?"</p>

<p>"Patsy nothin'! just only Patsy; that's all of it. The boys
calls me 'Humpty Dumpty' and 'Rags,' but that's sassy."</p>

<p>"But all little boys have another name, Patsy."</p>

<p>"Oh, I got another, if yer so dead set on it,&mdash;it's
Dinnis,&mdash;but Jim says 't won't wash; 't ain't no 'count, and I
wouldn't tell yer nothin' but a sure-pop name, and that's Patsy.
Jim says lots of other fellers out to the 'sylum has Dinnis fur
names, and they ain't worth shucks, nuther. Dinnis he must have had
orful much boys, I guess."</p>

<p>"Who is Jim?"</p>

<p>"Him and I's brothers, kind o' brothers, not sure 'nuff
brothers. Oh, I dunno how it is 'zactly,&mdash;Jim'll tell yer. He
dunno as I be, yer know, 'n he dunno <i>but</i> I be, 'n he's
afeard to leave go o' me for <i>fear</i> I be. See?"</p>

<p>"Do you and Jim live together?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we live at Mis' Kennett's. Jim swipes the grub; I build
the fires'n help cook'n wipe dishes for Jim when I ain't sick, 'n I
mind Miss Kennett's babies right along,&mdash;she most allers has
new ones, 'n she gives me my lunch for doin' it."</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Kennett nice and kind?"</p>

<p>"O-h, yes; she's orful busy, yer know, 'n won't stand no
foolin'."</p>

<p>"Is there a Mr. Kennett?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes there is, 'n most allers there ain't."</p>

<p>My face by this time was an animated interrogation point. My
need of explanation must have been hopelessly evident, for he
hastened to add footnotes to the original text.</p>

<p>"He's allers out o' work, yer know, 'n he don't sleep ter home,
'n if yer want him yer have to hunt him up. He's real busy now,
though,&mdash;doin' fine."</p>

<p>"That's good. What does he do?"</p>

<p>"He marches with the workingmen's percessions 'n holds
banners."</p>

<p>"I see." The Labor Problem and the Chinese Question were the
great topics of interest in all grades of California society just
then. My mission in life was to keep the children of these marching
and banner-holding laborers from going to destruction.</p>

<p>"And you haven't any father, poor little man?"</p>

<p>"Yer bet yer life I don't want no more father in mine. He
knocked me down them stairs, and then he went off in a ship, and I
don't go a cent on fathers! Say, is this a 'zamination?"</p>

<p>I was a good deal amused and should have felt a little rebuked,
had I asked a single question from idle curiosity. "Yes, it's a
sort of one, Patsy,&mdash;all the kind we have."</p>

<p>"And do I hev to bring any red tape?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, Jim said he bet 't would take an orful lot o' red tape t'
git me in."</p>

<p>Here he withdrew with infinite trouble from his ragged pocket an
orange, or at least the remains of one, which seemed to have been
fiercely dealt with by circumstances.</p>

<p>"Here's an orange I brung yer! It's been skwuz some, but there's
more in it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Patsy." (Forced expression of radiant gratitude.)
"Now, let us see! You want to come to the Kindergarten, do you, and
learn to be a happy little working boy? But oh, Patsy, I'm like the
old woman in the shoe, I have so many children I don't know what to
do."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Jim knows a boy what went here wunst. He said yer
never licked the boys; and he said, when the 'nifty' little girls
come to git in, with their white aprons, yer said there warn't no
room; but when the dirty chaps with tored close come, yer said
yer'd <i>make</i> room. Jim said as how yer'd never show <i>me</i>
the door, sure." (Bless Jim's heart!) "P'raps I can't come every
day, yer know, 'cos I might have fits."</p>

<p>"Fits! Good gracious, child! What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I has 'em" (composedly). "I kicks the footboard clean off
when I has 'em bad, all along o' my losin' them three year! Why,
yer got an orgind, hain't yer? Where's the handle fur to make it
go? Couldn't I blow it for yer?"</p>

<p>"It's a piano, not an organ; it doesn't need blowing."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I see one in a s'loon; I seen such an orful pretty
lady play on one. She give her silk dress a <i>swish</i> to one
side, so! and then she cocked her head over sideways like a bird,
and then her hands, all jinglin' over with rings, went a-whizzin'
up and down them black and white teeth just like sixty!"</p>

<p>"You know, Patsy, I can't bear to have my little Kindergarten
boys stand around the saloon doors; it isn't a good place, and if
you want to be good men you must learn to be good little boys
first, don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wanted some kind of fun. I seen a cirkis
wunst,&mdash;that was fun! I seen it through a hole; it takes four
bits to git inside the tent, and me and another feller found a big
hole and went halveys on it. First he give a peek, and then I give
a peek, and he was bigger'n me, and he took orful long peeks, he
did, 'nd when it come my turn the ladies had just allers jumped
<i>through</i> the hoops, or the horses was gone out; 'nd bimeby he
said mebbe we might give the hole a stretch and make it a little
mite bigger, it wouldn't do no harm, 'nd I'd better cut it, 'cos
his fingers was lame; 'nd I just cutted it a little mite, 'n' a cop
come up behind and h'isted us and I never seen no more cirkis; but
I went to Sunday-school wunst, and it warn't so much fun as the
cirkis!"</p>

<p>I thought I would not begin moral lectures at once, but seize a
more opportune time to compare the relative claims of Sunday-school
and circus.</p>

<p>"You've got things fixed up mighty handy here, haven't yer? It's
most as good as Woodward's Gardens,&mdash;fishes&mdash;'nd c'nary
birds&mdash;'nd flowers&mdash;'nd pictures&mdash;is there stories
to any of 'em?"</p>

<p>"Stories to every single one, Patsy! We've just turned that
corner by the little girl feeding chickens, and to-morrow we shall
begin on that splendid dog by the window."</p>

<p>Patsy's face was absolutely radiant with excitement. "Jiminy!
I'm glad I got in in time for that!&mdash;'nd ain't that a bear by
the door thar?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that's a mother bear with cubs."</p>

<p>"Has he got a story too?"</p>

<p>"Everything has a story in this room."</p>

<p>"Jiminy! 'ts lucky I didn't miss that one! There's a splendid
bear in a s'loon on Fourth Street,&mdash;mebbe the man would leave
him go a spell if you told him what a nice place you hed up here.
Say, them fishes keep it up lively, don't they?&mdash;s'pose
they're playin' tag?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," I said smilingly; "it looks like it. Now,
Patsy, I must be going home, but you shall come to-morrow, at nine
o'clock surely, remember! and the children will be so glad to have
another little friend. You'll dress yourself nice and clean, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should smile! but these is the best I got. I got
another part to this hat, though, and another pocket belongs with
these britches." (He alternated the crown and rim of a hat, but was
never extravagant enough to wear them at one time.) "Ain't I clean?
I cleaned myself by the feelin'!"</p>

<p>"Here's a glass, dear; how do you think you succeeded?"</p>

<p>"Jiminy! I didn't get much of a sweep on that, did I now? But
don't you fret, I've got the lay of it now, and I'll just polish
her off red-hot to-morrer, 'n don't you forgit it!"</p>

<p>"Patsy, here's a warm bun and a glass of milk; let's eat and
drink together, because this is the beginning of our friendship;
but please don't talk street words to Miss Kate; she doesn't like
them. I'll do everything I can to make you have a good time, and
you'll try to do a few things to please me, won't you?"</p>

<p>Patsy looked embarrassed, ate his bit of bun in silence, and
after twirling his hat-crown for a few seconds hitched out of the
door with a backward glance and muttered remark which must have
been intended for farewell.</p>

gone when the door opened again the least bit, and a sunny face
looked in, that of my friend and helper.</p>

<p>"Not gone yet, Kate?"</p>

<p>"No, but I thought I sent you away long ago."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but I've been to see Danny Kern's mother: there is
nothing to be done; we must do our best and leave it there. Was
that a boy I met on the stairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;that is, he is a boy in the sense that he is not a
girl. Oh, Helen, such a story! We must take him!"</p>

<p>She sank helplessly on one of the children's tables. "Now, my
dear guide, philosopher, and friend, did you happen to notice my
babies this morning? They were legion! Our mothers must have heard
that the Flower Mission intended giving us some Thanksgiving
dinners, for there were our five inevitable little
cat's-paws,&mdash;the identical five that applied just before the
Christmas tree, disappeared in vacation, turned up the day before
we went to the Mechanics' Fair, were lost to sight the day after,
presented themselves previous to the Woodward's Garden expedition,
and then went into retirement till to-day. Where am I going to
'sit' another child, pray? They were two in a seat and a dozen on
the floor this morning. It isn't fair to them, in one sense, for
they don't get half enough attention."</p>

<p>"You are right, dear; work half done is worse than wasted; but
it isn't fair to this child to leave him where he is."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know. I feel Fridayish, to tell the truth. I shall love
humanity again by Monday. Have we money for more chairs or
benches?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"You'll have to print an appeal for chairs; and the children may
wear out the floor sitting on it before the right people read
it!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and oh, Helen, a printed appeal is such a dead thing,
after all. If I could only fix on a printed page Danny Kern's smile
when he conquered his temper yesterday, put into type that hand
clasp of Mrs. Finnigan's that sent such a thrill of promise to our
hearts, show a subscriber Mrs. Guinee's quivering lips when she
thanked us for the change in Joe,&mdash;why, we shouldn't need
money very long."</p>

<p>"That is true. What a week we have had, Kate,&mdash;like a
little piece of the millennium!"</p>

<p>"You must not be disappointed if next week isn't as good; that
could hardly be. Let's see,&mdash;Mrs. Daniels began it on Monday
morning, didn't she, by giving the caps for the boys?"</p>

<p>"Yes," groaned Helen dismally, "a generous but misguided
benefactress! Forty-three caps precisely alike save as to size!
What scenes of carnage we shall witness when we distribute them
three times a day!"</p>

<p>"We must remedy that by sewing labels into the crowns, each
marked with the child's name in indelible ink."</p>

<p>"Exactly,&mdash;what a charming task! I shall have to write my
cherubs' names, I suppose,&mdash;most of them will take a yard of
tape apiece. I already recall Paulina Strozynski, Mercedes
McGafferty, and Sigismund Braunschweiger."</p>

<p>"And I, Maria Virginia de Rejas Perkins, Halfdan Christiansen,
and Americo Vespucci Garibaldi."</p>

<p>"This is our greatest misfortune since the donation of the
thirty-seven little red plaid shawls. Well, good-night. By the way,
what's his name?"</p>

<p>"Patsy Dennis. I shall take him. I'll tell you more on Monday.
Please step into Gilbert's and buy a comfortable little cane-seated
armchair, larger than these, and ask one of your good Samaritans to
make a soft cushion for it. We'll give him the table that we had
made for Johnny Cass. Poor Johnny! I am sorry he has a successor so
soon."</p>

<p>In five minutes I was taking my homeward walk, mind and heart
full of my elfish visitor, with his strange and ancient thoughts,
his sharp speeches and queer fancies. Would he ever come back, or
would one of those terrible spasms end his life before I was
permitted to help and ease his crooked body, or pour a bit of
mother-love into his starved little heart?</p>

"121" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" alt='M'>onday morning came
as mornings do come, bringing to the overworked body and mind a
certain languor difficult to shake off. As I walked down the dirty
little street, with its rows of old-clothes shops, saloons, and
second-hand-furniture stores, I called several of my laggards, and
gave them a friendly warning. "Quarter of nine, Mrs. Finnigan!"
"Bless me soul, darlin'! Well, I will hurry up my childern, that I
will; but the baby was that bad with whoopin'-cough last night that
I never got three winks meself, darlin'!"</p>

<p>"All right; never mind the apron; let Jimmy walk on with me, and
I will give him one at school." Jimmy trots proudly at my side,
munching a bit of baker's pie and carrying my basket. I drop into
Mrs. Powers' suite of apartments in Rosalie Alley, and find
Lafayette Powers still in bed. His twelve-year-old sister and
guardian, Hildegarde, has over-slept, as usual, and breakfast is
not in sight. Mrs. Powers goes to a dingy office up town at eight
o'clock, her present mission in life being the healing of the
nations by means of mental science. It is her fourth vocation in
two years, the previous ones being tissue-paper flowers, lustre
painting, and the agency for a high-class stocking supporter. I
scold Hildegarde roundly, and she scrambles sleepily about the room
to find a note that Mrs. Powers has left for me. I rejoin my court
in the street, and open the letter with anticipation.</p>

<br>


<p>Miss Kate.</p>

<p>Dear Maddam.&mdash;You complane of Lafayette's never getting to
school till eleven o'clock. It is not my affare as Hildegarde has
<i>full charge</i> of him and I <i>never</i> intefear, but I would
sujjest that if you <i>beleeve</i> in him he will do better. Your
unbeleef sapps his <i>will powers</i>. you have only reprooved him
for being late. why not incurrage him say by <i>paying</i> him 5
cents a morning for a wile to get amung his little maits on the
stroak of nine? "declare for good and good will work for you" is
one of our sayings. I have not time to treet Lafayette myself my
busness being so engroassing but if you would take a few minites
each night and <i>deny Fear along the 5 avanues</i> you could heel
him. Say <i>there is no Time in the infinnit</i> over and over
before you go to sleep. This will lift fear off of Lafayette, fear
of being late and he will get there in time.</p>

Yours for Good,<br>
 MRS. POWERS,<br>
 <i>Mental Heeler</i>.<br>


<p>Oh, what a naughty, ignorant, amusing, hypocritical, pathetic
world it is! I tuck the note in my pocket to brighten the day for
Helen, and we pass on.</p>

<p>As we progress we gather into our train Levi, Jacob, David,
Moses, Elias, and the other prophets and patriarchs who belong to
our band. We hasten the steps of the infant Garibaldi, who is
devouring refuse fruit from his mother's store, and stop finally to
pluck a small Dennis Kearney from the coal-hod, where he has been
put for safe-keeping. The day has really begun, and with its first
service the hands grow willing and the heart is filled with
sunshine.</p>

<p>As the boys at my side prattle together of the "percession" and
the "sojers" they saw yesterday, I wish longingly that I could be
transported with my tiny hosts to the sunny, quiet country on this
clear, lovely morning.</p>

<p>I think of my own joyous childhood, spent in the sweet
companionship of fishes, brooks, and butterflies, birds, crickets,
grasshoppers, whispering trees and fragrant wild flowers, and the
thousand and one playfellows of Nature which the good God has
placed within reach of the happy country children. I think of the
shining eyes of my little Lucys and Bridgets and Rachels could I
turn them loose in a field of golden buttercups and daisies, with
sweet wild strawberries hidden at their roots; of the merry glee of
my dear boisterous little prophets and patriots, if I could set
them catching tadpoles in a clear wayside pool, or hunting hens'
nests in the alder bushes behind the barn, or pulling yellow cow
lilies in the pond, or wading for cat-o'-nine-tails, with their
ragged little trousers tucked above their knees. And oh! hardest of
all to bear, I think of our poor little invalids, so young to
struggle with languor and pain! Just to imagine the joy of my poor,
lame boys and my weary, pale, and peevish children, so different
from the bright-eyed, apple-cheeked darlings of well-to-do
parents,&mdash;mere babies, who, from morning till night, seldom or
never know what it is to cuddle down warmly into the natural rest
of a mother's loving bosom!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;'>
<p>Monday morning came and went,&mdash;Monday afternoon also; it
was now two o'clock, and to my surprise and disappointment Patsy
had not appeared. The new chair with its pretty red cushion stood
expectant but empty. Helen had put a coat of shellac on poor Johnny
Cass's table, freshened up its squared top with new lines of red
paint, and placed a little silver vase of flowers on it. Our Lady
Bountiful had come in to pay for the chair and see the boy, but
alas! there was no boy to see. The children were all ready for him.
They knew that he was a sick boy, like Johnny Cass, tired, and not
able to run and jump, and that they must be good to him as they had
been to Johnny. This was the idea of the majority; but I do not
deny that there was a small minority which professed no interest
and promised no virtue. Our four walls contained a miniature
world,&mdash;a world with its best foot forward, too, but it was
not heaven.</p>

<p>At quarter past two I went into Helen's little room, where she
was drawing exquisite illustrations on a blackboard for next day's
"morning talk."</p>

<p>"Helen, the children say that a family of Kennetts live at 32
Anna Street, and I am going to see why Patsy didn't come. Oh yes, I
know that there are boys enough without running after them, but we
must have this particular boy, whether he wants to come or not, for
he is <i>sui generis</i>. He shall sit on that cushion</p>

<div class='blkquot'>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'And sew a fine seam,<br>
 And feast upon strawberries,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sugar and cream!'"</p>
</div>

<p>"I think a taste for martyrdom is just as difficult to eradicate
from the system as a taste for blood," Helen remarked whimsically.
"Very well, run on and I'll 'receive' in your absence. I could say
with Antony, 'Lend me your ears,' for I shall need them. Have you
any commands?"</p>

<p>"Just a few. Please tell Paulina Strozynski's big brother that
he <i>must</i> call for her earlier, and not leave her sitting on
the steps so long. Tell Mrs. Hickok that if she sends us another
child whom she knows to be down with the chicken-pox, we won't take
in her two youngest when they're old enough. Don't give Mrs.
Slamberg any aprons. She returned the little undershirts and
drawers that I sent her by Julie, and said 'if it was all the same
to me, she'd rather have something that would make a little more
show!' And&mdash;oh yes, do see if you can find Jacob Shubener's
hat; he is crying down in the yard, and doesn't dare go home
without it."</p>

<p>"Very well. Four cases. Strozynski&mdash;steps&mdash;cruelty.
Hickok&mdash;chicken-pox&mdash;ingratitude.
Slamberg&mdash;aprons&mdash;vanity.
Shubener&mdash;hat&mdash;carelessness. Oh that I could fasten
Jacob's hat to his ear by a steel chain! Has he looked in the
sink?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ash-barrel?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Up in the pepper-tree?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Then some one has 'chucked' it into the next yard, and the
janitor will have to climb the fence,&mdash;at his age! Oh, if I
could eliminate the irregular verb 'to chuck' from the vocabulary
of this school, I could 'make out of the broken sounds of life a
song, and out of life itself a melody,'" and she flew down-stairs
like a breeze, to find the patient Mr. Bowker. Mr. Bowker was a
nice little man, who had not all his wits about him, but whose
heart was quite intact, and who swept with energy and washed
windows with assiduity. He belonged to the Salvation Army, and the
most striking articles of his attire, when sweeping, were a
flame-colored flannel shirt and a shiny black hat with "Prepare to
Meet Thy God" on the front in large silver letters. The combination
of color was indescribably pictorial, and as lurid and suggestive
as an old-fashioned Orthodox sermon.</p>

<p>As I went through the lower hall, I found Mr. Bowker assisting
Helen to search the coal-bin. "Don't smile," she cried. "Punch
says, 'Sometimes the least likeliest place is more likelier than
the most likeliest,'&mdash;and sure enough, here is the hat! I
should have been named Deborah or Miriam,&mdash;not Helen!" and she
hurried to dry the tears of the weeping Jacob.</p>

number's 32-1/2, 'n I vow she gits more credit o' livin' in the
front house 'n I do, 'n I pay four dollars more rent! Ever see her?
I thought not! I guess 'f you hed you wouldn't think of her livin'
in a house like this!"</p>

<p>"Excuse me. I didn't expect to make any trouble"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I've nothin' agin <i>you</i>, but just let me ketch her
puttin' on airs 'n pertendin' to live like her betters, that's all!
She's done it before, but I couldn't never ketch her at it. The
idee of her keepin' up a house like this!" and with a superb sniff
like that of a battle-horse, she disappeared from the front window
of her ancestral mansion and sought one at the back which might
command a view of my meeting with her rival.</p>

<p>I slid meekly through a side gate, every picket of which was
decorated with a small child, stumbled up a dark narrow passage,
and found myself in a square sort of court out of which rose the
rear houses so objectionable to my Duchess in the front row.</p>

<p>It was not plain sailing, by any means, owing to the collection
of tin cans and bottles through which I had to pick my way, but I
climbed some frail wooden steps, and stood at length on the landing
of Number 32-1/2.</p>

<p>The door was open, and there sat <a name="minding">Patsy,
"minding" the Kennett baby,</a> a dull little lump of humanity,
whose brain registered impressions so slowly that it would play all
day long with an old shoe without exhausting its possibilities.</p>

<p>Patsy himself was dirtier than ever, and much more sullen and
gloomy. The traces of tears on his cheeks made my heart leap into
my throat. "Oh, Patsy," I exclaimed, "I am so glad to find you! We
expected you all day, and were afraid you weren't well."</p>

<p>Not a word of response.</p>

<p>"We have a chair all ready for you; it is standing right under
one of the plant-shelves, and there are three roses in bloom
to-day!"</p>

<p>Still not a word.</p>

<p>"And I had to tell the dog story without you!"</p>

<p>The effect of this simple statement was very different from what
I had anticipated. I thought I knew what a child was likely to do
under every conceivable set of circumstances, but Patsy was
destined to be more than once a revelation to me.</p>

<p>He dashed a book of colored advertisements that he held into the
farthest corner of the room, threw himself on the floor at full
length and beat it with his hands, while he burst into a passion of
tears. "There! there!" he cried between his sobs, "I told 'em you'd
tell it! I told 'em you'd tell it! I told 'em you'd&mdash;but oh, I
thought maybe you wouldn't!" His wails brought Mrs. Kennett from a
back piazza where she was washing.</p>

<p>"Are you the teacher o' the <i>Kids Guards</i>, 'm?"</p>

<p>"Yes." It did not strike me at the time, in my anxiety, what a
sympathetic rendering of the German word this was; but we
afterwards found that "Kindergarten" was thus translated in Anna
Street.</p>

<p>"Patsy couldn't go to-day, 'm, on account of him hevin' no good
boots, 'm, Jim not bein' paid off till Wednesday, 'n me hevin' no
notice he hed no clean shirt, 'm, this not bein' his clean-shirt
week, 'm. He takes it awful hard about that there story, 'm. I told
him as how you'd be after tellin' another one next week, but it
seems nothin' will comfort him."</p>

<p>"Ev'rybuddy's allers lyin' to me," he moaned; "there warn't
another dog picture like that in the hull room!"</p>

<p>"Don't take no notice of him, 'm, an' he'll git over it; he's
subjick to these spells of takin' on like. Set up, Pat, an' act
decent! Tell the lady you'll come when you git your boots."</p>

<p>"Patsy, boy, stop crying a minute and listen to me," I said. "If
Mrs. Kennett is willing, I have some things that will fit you; you
shall come right back with me now,&mdash;all the children have
gone,&mdash;and you and I will be alone with the sunshine and the
birds and the fishes, as we were the other day, and I will tell you
the dog story just as I told it to the other children this
morning."</p>

<p>He got up slowly, rubbed his tattered sleeve across his wet
cheek, and looked at me searchingly to see if I might be trusted;
then he limped to the sink, treated his face and hands to a hasty
but energetic scrub, seized his fragment of a hat, gave his brief
trousers a hitch which had the air of being the last exquisite
touch to a faultless toilet, and sat down on the landing to mend
his twine shoe-lace.</p>

<p>"Who is your neighbor in Number 32, Mrs. Kennett?" I asked as I
rose to go. "I went there to find you."</p>

<p>"Did you indeed, 'm? Well, I hope she treated you civil, 'm,
though it don't be much in her line. She's a Mis' Mooney, 'm. I
know <i>her</i>, but she don't know <i>me</i> anny more sence she's
riz in the wurrld. She moved out of this house whin I moved into
it, but none of us ladies here is good enough for her to 'sociate
with <i>now</i>, 'm! You see her husband was in the rag, sack, and
bottle business, 'm, 'n a wealthy gintleman friend set him up in a
fish-cart, an' it's kind of onsettled her, 'm! Some folks can't
stan' prosperity. If 't bed bin grad<i>joo</i>al like, she might
have took it more natcheral; but it come all of a suddent, an'
she's that purse-proud now, 'm, that she'll be movin' up on Nob
Hill ef she don't hev no stroke o' bad luck to show 'er her place!
Good day, 'm!"</p>

<p>I carved my way through the tin cans and bottles again under the
haughty eye of my Duchess of the fish-cart, and in a few minutes
Patsy and I were again in Silver Street.</p>

<p>When we entered the room he looked about with an expression of
entire content. "It's all here!" he said with a sigh, as if he had
feared to find it a dream.</p>

<p>The chair with its red cushion pleased him greatly; then, after
a few moments' talk to make him feel a little at home, we drew up
to the picture, and I took his cleanest hand in mine, and told him
the story of Victor, the brave St. Bernard dog.</p>

<p>It was an experience never to be repeated and never to be
forgotten!</p>

KINDLES AT THE TOUCH OF JOY.</b></p>

<div class='blkquot'>
<p>"If you make children happy now, you will make them happy twenty
years hence by the memory of it."</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Illus-083.png" width="120" height=
"118" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt='T'>he next morning
when I reached the little tin shop on the corner,&mdash;a blessed
trysting-place, forever sacred, where the children waited for me in
sunshine, rain, wind, and storm, unless forbidden,&mdash;there on
the step sat faithful Patsy, with a clean and shining morning face,
all glowing with anticipation. How well I remember my poor lad's
first day! Where should I seat him? There was an empty space beside
little Mike Higgins, but Mike's character, obtained from a fond and
candid parent, had been to the effect "that he was in heaven any
time if he could jest lay a boy out flat"! And there was a place by
Moses, but he was very much of a fop just then, owing to a new
"second-hand" coat, and might make scathing allusions to Patsy's
abbreviated swallow-tail.</p>

<p>But a pull at my skirt and a whisper from the boy decided
me.</p>

<p>"Please can't I set aside o' you, Miss Kate?"</p>

<p>"But, Patsy, the fun of it is I never do sit."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought teachers never done nothin' but set!"</p>

<p>"You don't know much about little boys and girls, that's sure!
Well, suppose you put your chair in front and close to me. Here is
Maggie Bruce on one side. She is a real little Kindergarten mother,
and will show you just how to do everything. Won't you,
Maggie?"</p>

<p>We had our morning hymn and our familiar talk, in which we
always "outlined the policy" of the new day; for the children were
apt to be angelic and receptive at nine o'clock in the morning, the
unwillingness of the spirit and weakness of the flesh seldom
overtaking them till an hour or so later. It chanced to be a
beautiful day, for Helen and I were both happy and well, our
volunteer helpers were daily growing more zealous and efficient,
and there was no tragedy in the immediate foreground.</p>

<p>In one of the morning songs, when Paulina went into the circle
and threw good-morning kisses to the rest, she wafted a dozen of
them to the ceiling, a proceeding I could not understand.</p>

<p>"Why did you throw so many of your kisses up in the air, dear?"
I asked, as she ran back to my side.</p>

<p>"Them was good-mornings to Johnny Cass, so 't he wouldn't feel
lonesome," she explained; and the tender bit of remembrance was
followed out by the children for days afterward. Was it not enough
to put us in a gentle humor?</p>

<p>Patsy was not equal to the marching when, later on, the
Lilliputian army formed itself in line and kept step to the music
of a lively tune, and he was far too shy on the first day to join
in the play, though he watched the game of the Butterfly with
intense interest from his nook by the piano.</p>

<p>After the tiny worm had wriggled itself realistically into a
cocoon it went to sleep; and after a moment of dramatic silence,
the little one chosen for the butterfly would separate herself from
the still cocoon and fly about the circle, sipping mimic honey from
the child-flowers.</p>

<p>To see Carlotty Griggs "being a butterfly," with utter intensity
of joy and singleness of purpose, was a sight to be remembered. For
Carlotty was a pickaninny four years old, and blacker than the Ace
of Spades! Her purple calico dress, pink apron, and twenty little
woolly braids tied with bits of yellow ribbon made her the most
tropical of butterflies; and the children, having a strong sense of
color and hardly any sense of humor, were always entirely carried
away by her antics.</p>

"Carlotty Griggs &quot;being a Butterfly.&quot;"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i><b><small>Carlotty Griggs
"being a Butterfly."</small></b></i></p>

<p>Carlotty had huge feet,&mdash;indeed, Carlotty "toed in," for
that matter; but her face shone with delight; her eyes glistened,
and so did her teeth; and when she waved her ebony hands and
flitted among the children, she did it as airily as any real
butterfly that ever danced over a field of clover blossoms.</p>

<p>And if Patsy's joy was great in the play, it was greater still
in the work that came afterward. When Helen gave him a scarlet and
gold mat to weave, his fingers trembled with eagerness; and the
expression of his face caused that impulsive young person to fly to
my side and whisper, "Oh, why should one ever 'want to be an angel'
when one can be a Kindergartner!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;'>
<p>From this time on, Patsy was the first to come in the morning
and the last to leave at night. He took the whole institution under
his guardianship, and had a watchful eye for everybody and
everything belonging to it.</p>

<p>He soon learned the family history of every child in the school,
and those family histories, I assure you, were of an exciting
nature; but so great were Patsy's prudence and his idea of the
proprieties that he never divulged his knowledge till we were
alone. Then his tongue would be loosed, and he would break into his
half-childlike, half-ancient and reflective conversation.</p>

<p>He had a stormy temper, which, however, he was fast learning to
control, and he was not always kind and gentle with his little
playfellows; for he had been raised in a hard school, and the
giving and taking of blows was a natural matter, to him the only
feasible manner of settling a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>His conduct to me, however, was touching in its devotion and
perfect obedience; and from the first hour he was my poor little
knight <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though not perfect, he was greatly changed for the
better. We had given him a neat little coat and trousers, his hair
was short and smooth, and his great dark eyes shone with
unutterable content. He was never joyous; born under a cloud, he
had lived in its shadow, and sorrow too early borne had left its
indelible impress, to be removed only by that "undisturbed vision
of the Father's face, which is joy unutterable;" but for the first
time in his life he was at peace.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Anna Street had moved into a house a trifle
better suited to her exalted station in life; one where the view
was better, and the society worthy of a fish-peddler's family.
Accordingly we transferred the Kennetts into Number 32, an honor
which they took calmly at first, on account of the odor of fish
that pervaded the apartments. The three and four year old Kennetts
were now members of our flock, the dull baby was cared for daily by
the Infant Shelter, and Mrs. Kennett went out washing; while her
spouse upheld the cause of labor by attending sand-lot meetings in
the afternoon and marching in the evening.</p>

<p>So, in the rainy winter afternoons, when the other children had
gone, Patsy and I stayed together and arranged the next day's
occupations. Slang was being gradually eliminated from his
conversation; but it is no small task to correct nine years of bad
grammar, and I never succeeded in doing it. Alas! the time was all
too short.</p>

<p>It was Patsy who sorted the wools and threaded the needles, and
set right the sewing-cards of the babies; and only the initiated
can comprehend the labyrinthine maze into which an energetic
three-year-old can transform a bit of sewing. It was he who fished
the needles from the cracks in the floor, rubbed the blackboards,
and scrubbed the slates, talking busily the while.</p>

<p>"Jiminy! (I take that back.) Miss Kate, we can't let Jimmy Buck
have no more needles; he sows 'em thick as seed round his chair.
Now, now jis' look yere! Ef that Battles chap hain't scratched the
hull top of this table with a buzzer! I'd lam him good ef I was
you, I would."</p>

<p>"Do you think our Kindergarten would be the pleasant place it is
if I whipped little boys every day?"</p>

<p>"No-o-o! But there is times"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, Patsy, but I have never found them."</p>

<p>"Jim's stayin' out nights, this week," said he one day, "'nd I
hez to stay along o' Mis' Kennett till nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought Jim always stayed at home in the evening."</p>

<p>"Yes, he allers used ter; but he's busy now lookin' up a girl,
don't yer know."</p>

<p>"Looking up a girl! What do you mean, Patsy?"</p>

<p>Patsy scratched his head with the "ten-toothed comb of
Nature,"&mdash;a habit which prevailed with terrible and suggestive
frequency when I first came "into my kingdom,"&mdash;and
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lookin' up a girl! Why, I s'posed yer knew that. I dunno
'zackly. Jim says all the fellers does. He says he hates to git the
feed an' wash the dishes orfly, 'nd girls likes ter do it best of
anything."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried I, light bursting in upon my darkened intellect when
dish-washing was mentioned; "he wants to get married!"</p>

<p>"Well, he has ter look up a girl first, don't yer s'pose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; but I don't see how Jim can get money enough to
take care of a wife. He only has thirty dollars a month."</p>

<p>"Well, he's goin' ter get a girl what'll 'go halveys,' don't yer
know, and pay for her keep. He'd ruther have a 'millingnary'
girl&mdash;they're the nicest; but if he can't, he's goin' to try
for one out of the box factory."</p>

<p>"Oh, Patsy! I wish"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, didn't I ought ter say that?"</p>

<p>"I wish you had a mother, dear."</p>

<p>"If I had, I'd know more 'n I do now," and a great sigh heaved
itself upward from beneath the blue jacket.</p>

<p>"No, you wouldn't know so much, Patsy, or at least you would get
the right end first. Never mind, dear boy, you can't
understand."</p>

<p>"Jim says Mis' Kennett 'nd I needn't set such store by you,
'cause the fust chance you gits you'll git married." (I always did
have an elective antipathy for Jim.) "Shall yer, Miss Kate?"</p>

<p>"Why, dear, I think we are very happy as we are, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ef I could only stay f'rever, 'nd not go ter the reel
school. Jim says I ought ter be gittin' book learnin' pretty
soon."</p>

<p>"Did you tell him that Miss Helen was teaching you to read and
write a little while every afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I told him. He liked it fust rate. Mis' Kennett said she'd
let her childern stay f'rever with yer, ef they never larned a
thing, 'nd so would I, dear, dear Miss Kate! Oh, I bet God would
like to see you in that pretty blue dress!" and he hung over me
with a speechless caress; his first, and last indeed, for he was
shy and reticent in emotion, and never once showed his affection in
the presence of the other children.</p>

slipped by, we could not help seeing that Patsy's pale face grew
paler and his soft dark eyes larger and more pathetic. In spite of
better care than he had ever had before, he was often kept at home
by suffering all too intense for a child to bear. It was almost as
if a sixth sense came to him in those days, so full was he of
strange thoughts and intuitions. His eyes followed me wistfully as

<p>Daga Ohlsen had left us. Her baby eyes had opened under Norway
skies, but her tongue had learned the trick of our language when
her father and mother could not speak nor understand a word, and so
she became a childish interpreter of manners and customs in
general. But we knew that mothers' hearts are the same the world
over, and, lacking the power to put our sympathy in words, we sent
Daga's last bit of sewing to her mother. Sure enough, no word was
needed; the message explained itself; and when we went to take a
last look at the dear child, the scrap of cardboard lay in the
still hand, the needle threaded with yellow wool, the childish
knot, soiled and cumbersome, hanging below the pattern just as she
had left it. It was her only funeral offering, her only funeral
service, and was it not something of a sermon? It told the history
of her industry, her sudden call from earthly things, and her
mother's tender thought. It chanced to be a symbol, too, as things
do chance sometimes, for it was a butterfly dropping its cocoon
behind it, and spreading its wings for flight.</p>

<p>Patsy had been our messenger during Daga's illness, and his mind
was evidently on that mystery which has puzzled souls since the
beginning of time; for no anxious, weary, waiting heart has ever
ceased to beat without its passionate desire to look into the
beyond.</p>

<p>"Nixy Jones's mother died yesterday, Miss Kate. They had an
orful nice funeral."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sorry for the poor little children; they will miss
their mamma."</p>

<p>"Not 'nuff to hurt 'em! Them Joneses never cared nuthin' for
nobody; they was playing on tin oyster cans the hull blessed
ev'nin', till Jim went 'nd stop't 'em, 'nd told 'em it warn't
perlite. Say how dretful it must be to go down into the cold, dark
ground, and be shut up in a tight box, 'nd want to git
out&mdash;git out&mdash;'nd keep hollerin' 'nd a-hollerin', and
nobody come to fetch yer, cause yer's dead!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Patsy, child, stop such fearful thoughts! I hope people are
glad and willing to stay when they are dead. The part of them that
wonders and thinks and feels and loves and is happy or
sad&mdash;you know what I mean, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said slowly, leaning his head on his hand.</p>

<p>"God takes care of that part; it is His own, and He makes it all
right. And as for our bodies, Patsy, you don't care about keeping
your poor little aching back, do you? You talk about the cold, dark
earth. Why, I think of it as the tender, warm earth, that holds the
little brown acorn until it begins to grow into a spreading
oak-tree, and nurses the little seeds till they grow into lovely
blossoming flowers. Now we must trot home, Patsy. Wrap this shawl
over your shoulders, and come under my umbrella."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't need any shawl, please. I'm so orful hot!"</p>

<p>"That's just the reason," I replied, as I looked with anxious
eyes at his flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>I left him at the little door on Anna Street, and persuaded Mrs.
Kennett to give him some hot soup at dinner-time.</p>

<p>The next morning I was startled from a profound sleep by a
tremendous peal of the door-bell. Though only half awakened, my
forebodings seemed realized; and the bell rang "Patsy" in my
ears.</p>

<p>I hastily slipped on my dress, and, going to the door, saw just
whom I expected,&mdash;Jim.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Patsy?"</p>

<p>"He's turrible bad, miss; he got took with one o' them fits the
worst kind in the night, and liked ter died. Yer could a heerd him
screech a block off."</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor boy! Have you had a doctor? What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Well, he said he guessed it was the last one, miss, 'nd I'm
afraid it is, sure."</p>

<p>"Who is with him now? Are you going right back?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss, soon as I go 'nd git leave from the boss. Mis'
Kennett's went to her washin'. She couldn't 'ford ter lose a job. I
found Mr. Kennett, 'nd he's mindin' Patsy. He cries for you; he
says he don't want nothin' but jest Miss Kate, and he's that crazy
he wants to git up 'nd come to the Kindergarten."</p>

<p>"Dear little lad!" I said, trying to keep back the tears. "Here,
Jim, take the school keys to Miss Helen, and ask her to take my
place to-day. I'll start in ten minutes for Patsy."</p>

<p>"Thank yer, miss. I tell yer, he's a crooked little chap, but
he's as smart as they make 'em; 'nd annyhow, he's all the folks
I've got in the world, 'nd I hope we kin pull him through."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;'>
<p>"Pull him through!" Had years passed over Patsy's head since I
saw him last? He seemed to have grown old with the night's pain,
but the eyes shone out with new lustre and brilliancy, making
ready, I thought, to receive the heavenly visions.</p>

<p>We were alone. I could not bear Mr. Kennett's presence, and had
dispatched him for the doctor. I knelt by the bedside, and took his
cold hand in mine. I could not pray God to spare him, it was so
clear that He had better take him to Himself.</p>

<p>"I knowed you'd come, Miss Kate," he said faintly; "I knowed
you'd hurry up; you's allers hurryin' up for us boys."</p>

<p>Oh, how beautiful, how awesome, it is to be the messenger of
peace to an unhappy soul! So great a joy is it to bear that it is
not given to many twice in a lifetime.</p>

<p>The rain beat upon the frail roof, the wind blew about the
little house, and a darkness of fast-gathering black clouds fell
into the room in place of the morning sunbeams. It was a gloomy day
for a journey, but if one were traveling from shadow into sunshine,
I thought, it would not matter much.</p>

<p>"Mis' Kennett says I must hev a priest, but I don't want no
priest but you," whispered the faint voice as I bent over the
pillows. "What does priests do when folks is sick, Miss Kate?"</p>

<p>"They pray, Patsy."</p>

<p>"What fur?"</p>

<p>I paused, for in my grief I could think of no simple way of
telling that ignorant little child what they did pray for.</p>

<p>"They will pray for you, dear," I said at length, "because they
will want to talk to God about the little boy who is coming to Him;
to tell Him how glad they are that he is to be happy at last, but
that they shall miss him very, very much."</p>

<p>"The priest lives clear out Market Street, 'nd he wouldn't git
'ere 'fore God knew the hull thing 'thout his tellin' of it. You
pray, Miss Kate."</p>

<p><i>"O thou dear, loving Father in Heaven, Patsy's Father and
mine, who givest all the little children into their mothers' arms,
if one of them is lost and wandering about the world forlorn and
alone, surely Thou wilt take him to a better home! We send little
Patsy to Thee, and pray that his heart may be fitted with joy and
thankfulness when he comes to live in Thy house."</i></p>

<p>"Tell 'im 'bout them three years what I lost, so 't He'll make
'lowance, jest as you did."</p>

<p><i>"O God, who saw fit to lay a heavy burden on Patsy's little
shoulders and take away his three years, make them up to him in his
heavenly life."</i></p>

<p>"Yer never said Amen! 'T ain't no good 'thout yer say Amen!"</p>

<p><i>"Amen!"</i></p>

<p>Silence for many minutes. The brain was alive with thoughts, but
the poor tired body was weakened already with the labor of telling
them. When he spoke again, it was more slowly and with greater
difficulty.</p>

<p>"I guess&mdash;Heaven&mdash;is kind o' like&mdash;our
Kindergartent&mdash;don't you? 'nd so&mdash;I ain't goin' to
feel&mdash;strange! There'll be beautiful places, with flowers
bloomin' in 'em, 'nd birds 'nd brooks mebbe, like those in the
stories you tell us, and lots of singin' like we have; and the
peoples are good to each other, like our children, 'ceptin' Jimmy
Battles,&mdash;'nd they'll do each other's work, 'nd wait on the
angels, 'nd run errants for God, I s'pose&mdash;and everybody'll
wear clean&mdash;white&mdash;aprons&mdash;like in the
picture-books; but I sha'n't like it much 'thout you git there
pretty quick, Miss Kate;&mdash;but I ain't goin' to cry!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Patsy, my boy, it is for those who are left behind to cry.
It must be better to go."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm willin'. I've got enough o' this, I tell yer, with
backaches, 'nd fits, 'nd boys callin' sassy names&mdash;'nd no
gravy ever on my pertater;&mdash;but I hate to go 'way from the
Kindergartent&mdash;only p'raps Heaven is just like, only bigger,
'nd more children&mdash;'nd no Jimmy Battleses! Sing about the
pleasant mornin' light, will yer, please&mdash;Miss Kate?"</p>

<p>And in a voice choked with tears, as Jim came in and lifted
Patsy in his arms, I sang the hymn that he had sung, with folded
hands and reverent mien, every morning of his life in the
Kindergarten:&mdash;</p>

<div class='blkquot'>
<p>"Father, we thank Thee for the night,<br>
 And for the pleasant morning light;<br>
 For rest and gladness, love and care,<br>
 And all that makes the day so fair!<br>
 Help us to do the things we should:<br>
 To be to others kind and good;<br>
 In all we do, in work or play,<br>
 To grow more loving every day!"</p>
</div>

<p>The last lingering, trembling note fell upon the death-like
stillness of the room, as with one sharp, brief struggle, one look
of ineffable love and peace, the tired lids drooped heavily over
the eyes never to be lifted again. Light had gleamed upon the
darkened pathway, but the silent room, the dying fire, the failing
light, and the falling rain were all in fellowship with Death. My
blessed boy! God had given him back his three lost years!</p>

<p>"Oh, it is hard to take to heart the lesson that such deaths
will teach, but let no man reject it, for it is one that all must
learn. When Death strikes down the innocent and young, from every
fragile form from which he lets the panting spirit free a hundred
virtues rise, in shapes of mercy, charity, and love, to walk the
world and bless it. Of every tear that sorrowing mortals shed on
such green graves, some good is born, some gentler nature
comes."</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
