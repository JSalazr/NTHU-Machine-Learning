<h2>BRUCE CASTLE, TOTTENHAM.</h2>

<div class="figure" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/350-001.png"><img width = "100%" src="images/350-001.png" alt="BRUCE CASTLE, TOTTENHAM." /></a></div>

<p>The engraving represents this interesting
structure, as it appeared in the year 1686;
being copied from a print, after a picture
by Wolridge.</p>

<p>The original castle was very ancient, as
appears by the foundations, and an old
brick tower over a deep well, the upper
part of which has been used as a dairy.
The castle is said to have been built by
Earl Waltheof, who, in 1069 married
Judith, niece to William the Conqueror,
who gave him the earldom of Northampton
and Huntingdon for her portion.
Matilda or Maud, their only child, after
the death of Simon St. Liz, her first husband,
married David, first of the name,
king of Scotland; and Maud, being
heiress of Huntingdon, had in her own
right, as an appendix to that honour, the
manor of Tottenham in Middlesex.</p>

<p>Robert Bruce, grandson of David,
Earl of Huntingdon, and grandfather to
Robert I. of Scotland, memorable as the
restorer of the independence of his country,
became one of the competitors for
the crown of Scotland in 1290, but being
superseded by John Baliol, Bruce retired
to England, and settled at his grandfather's
estate at Tottenham, repaired the
castle, and acquiring another manor, called
it and the castle after his own name.
Shakspeare says,</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and the fortunes of the two Bruces are
"confirmation strong as holy writ."</p>

<p>The estate being forfeited to the crown,
it had different proprietors, till 1631,
when it was in the possession of Hugh
Hare, Lord Coleraine. Henry Hare, the
last Lord Coleraine of that family, having
been deserted by his wife, who obstinately
refused, for twenty years, to
return to him, formed a connexion with
Miss Roze Duplessis, a French lady, by
whom he had a daughter, born in Italy,
whom he named Henrietta Roza Peregrina,
and to whom he left all his estates.
This lady married the late Mr. Alderman
Townsend; but, being an alien, she
could not take the estates; and the will
being legally made, barred the heirs at
law; so that the estate escheated to the
crown. However, a grant of these estates,
confirmed by act of parliament,
was made to Mr. Townsend and his
lady, whose son, Henry Hare Townsend,
Esq. in 1792, voluntarily sold the property
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>
for the payment of the family debts;
and "although the castle may soon be
levelled with the ground, yet the destruction
of this ancient fabric will acquire
him more honour, than if the prudence
of his ancestors had enabled him to restore
the three towers, of which now only
one remains."<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>



<p>The present mansion is partly ancient,
and partly modern, and was very lately the
property of Sir William Curtis, Bart.
Up to the period at which the castle is represented
in the engraving, the building
must have undergone many alterations,
as the tower on the left, and the two
octagonal and centre towers, will prove.
The grounds there appear laid out in the
trim fashion of the seventeenth century,
and ornamented with fountains, vases,
&amp;c.</p>

<h3>NEW YEAR'S CUSTOM.</h3>

<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>


<p>BROMLEY PAGETS, Staffordshire, is
129 miles from London, and is a pretty
town on the skirts of Derbyshire. This
place is remarkable, or was lately, for a
sport on New Year's Day and Twelfth
Day, called <i>The Hobby-Horse Dance</i>,
from a person who rode upon the image
of a horse, with a bow and arrow in his
hands, with which he made a snapping
noise, and kept time to the music, while
six men danced the hay and other country
dances, with as many deer's heads
on their shoulders. To this hobby-horse
belonged a pot, which the reeves of the
town kept filled with cakes and ale, towards
which the spectators contributed a
penny, and with the remainder they maintained
their poor and repaired the church.</p>

<h3>FALLING STONES.</h3>

<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>


<p>Of these bodies, the most general opinion
now is, that they are really of <i>celestial</i>
origin. But a few years ago, nothing
could have appeared more absurd than
the idea that we should ever be able to
examine the most minute fragment of the
siderial system; and it must, no doubt,
be reckoned among the wonders of the
age in which we live, that considerable
portions of these heavenly bodies are now
known to have descended to the earth.
An event so wonderful and unexpected
was at first received with incredulity and
ridicule; but we may now venture to
consider the fact as well established as
any other hypothesis of natural philosophy,
which does not actually admit of
mathematical demonstration. The attention
of our philosophers was first called
to this subject by the falling of one of
these masses of matter near Flamborough
Head, in Yorkshire; it weighed about 50
pounds, and for some years after its descent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>
did not excite the interest it deserved,
nor would perhaps that attention
have been paid to it which was required
for the investigation of the truth, if a
similar and more striking phenomenon
had not happened a few years afterwards
at Benares, in the East Indies. Some
fragments of the stones which fell in
India were brought to Sir Joseph Banks
by Major Williams; and Sir Joseph being
desirous of knowing if there might not be
some truth in these repeated accounts of
falling stones, gave them to be analyzed,
when it was found by a very skilful analysis,
published in the Transactions,
1802, that the stones collected in various
countries, and to which a similar history
is attached, contained very peculiar ingredients,
and all of the same kind. The
earthy parts were silex and magnesia, in
which were interspersed small grains of
metallic iron. Since these investigations,
the subject has attracted very general attention,
and most of the fragments of
stones said to have fallen from heaven,
and which have been preserved in the
cabinets of the curious, on account of this
tradition, have been analyzed, and found
to consist of the same ingredients, varying
only in their different proportions.</p>

<p>Pliny relates, that a great stone fell
near Egos Potamos, in the Thracian
Chersonese, in the second year of the
78th Olympiad. In the year 1706, another
large stone is, on the authority of
Paul Lucas, then at Larissa, said to have
fallen in Macedonia. It weighed 72
pounds. Cardan assures us, that a shower
of at least 1,200 stones fell in Italy, the
largest of which weighed 120 pounds;
and their fall was accompanied by a great
light in the air.</p>

<p>The caaba, or great black stone, preserved
by the Mahometans in the Temple
of Mecca, had probably a celestial origin.
It is said to have been brought from
heaven by the angel Gabriel. Some astronomers
imagine that these stones have
been thrown from a lunar volcano. There
is nothing, perhaps, philosophically inconsistent
in this theory, for volcanic appearances
have been seen in the moon;
and a force such as our volcanoes exert
would be sufficient to project fragments
that might possibly arrive at the surface
of the earth. But probability is certainly
against it, and it seems more likely that
they are fragments of comets. For those
bodies, from their own nature, must be
subject to chemical changes of a very violent
nature; add to this, that from the
smallness of their dimensions, a fragment
projected from them with a very slight
velocity would never return to the mass
to which it originally belonged; but
would traverse the celestial regions till it
met with some planetary or other body
sufficiently ponderous to attract it to itself.</p>

<p>We have numerous other instances of
these phenomena, which are attested by
many very credible witnesses, but I will
not at present monopolize more of your
valuable pages with this subject, though
one of considerable interest; yet I may,
perhaps, at some future period, if agreeable,
send you a few rather more circumstantial
and more interesting accounts
than the above.</p>

<h3>THE POET, CHATTERTON.</h3>

<h4><i>(To the Editor of the Mirror.)</i></h4>


<p>Should the following notice of Chatterton,
which I copy from a <i>small handkerchief</i>
in my possession, be thought
worthy of a place in the MIRROR, you
will oblige me by inserting it. The
handkerchief has been in my possession
about twenty-five years, and was probably
printed soon after the poet's death; he is
represented sitting at a table, writing, in
a miserable apartment; behind him the
bed turned up, &amp;c.</p>

<p>SUFFOLK.</p>
<br />

<p><i>The Distressed Poet, or a true representation
of the unfortunate Chatterton.</i></p>

<p>The painting from which the engraving
was taken of the distressed poet, was the
work of a friend of the unfortunate
Chatterton. This friend drew him in the
situation in which he is represented in
this plate. Anxieties and cares had advanced
his life, and given him an older
look than was suited to his age. The
sorry apartment portrayed in the print,
the folded bed, the broken utensil below
it, the bottle, the farthing candle, and
the disorderly raiment of the bard, are
not inventions of fancy. They were
realities; and a satire upon an age and a
nation of which generosity is doubtless a
conspicuous characteristic. But poor
Chatterton was born under a bad star:
his passions were too impetuous, and in
a distracted moment he deprived himself
of an existence, which his genius, and
the fostering care of the public would
undoubtedly have rendered comfortable
and happy. Unknown and miserable
while alive, he now calls forth curiosity
and attention. Men of wit and learning
employ themselves to celebrate his talents,
and to express their approbation of his
writings. Hard indeed was his fate, born
to adorn the times in which he lived, yet
compelled to fall a victim to pride and
poverty! His destiny, cruel as it was,
gives a charm to his verses; and while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>
the bright thought excites admiration,
the recollection of his miseries awakens a
tender sympathy and sorrow. Who
would not wish that he had been so fortunate
as to relieve a fellow creature so
accomplished, from wretchedness, despair,
and suicide?</p>


<h4>WRITTEN ON VIEWING THE PORTRAIT OF CHATTERTON.</h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Ah! what a contrast in that face portray'd,</p>
<p>Where care and study cast alternate shade;</p>
<p>But view it well, and ask thy heart the cause,</p>
<p>Then chide, with honest warmth, that cold applause</p>
<p>Which counteracts the fostering breath of praise,</p>
<p>And shades with cypress the young poet's bays:</p>
<p>Pale and dejected, mark, how genius strives</p>
<p>With poverty, and mark, how well it thrives;</p>
<p>The shabby cov'ring of the gentle bard,</p>
<p>Regard it well, 'tis worthy thy regard,</p>
<p>The friendly cobweb, serving for a screen,</p>
<p>The chair, a part of what it once had been;</p>
<p>The bed, whereon th' unhappy victim slept</p>
<p>And oft unseen, in silent anguish, wept,</p>
<p>Or spent in dear delusive dreams, the night,</p>
<p>To wake, next morning, but to curse the light,</p>
<p>Too deep distress the artist's hand reveals;</p>
<p>But like a friend's the black'ning deed conceals;</p>
<p>Thus justice, to mild complacency bends,</p>
<p>And candour, all harsh influence, suspends.</p>
<p>Enthron'd, supreme in judgment, mercy sits,</p>
<p>And, in one breath condemns, applauds, acquits:</p>
<p>Whoe'er thou art, that shalt this face survey,</p>
<p>And turn, with cold disgust, thine eyes away.</p>
<p>Then bless thyself, that sloth and ignorance bred</p>
<p>Thee up in safety, and with plenty fed,</p>
<p>Peace to thy mem'ry! may the sable plume</p>
<p>Of dulness, round thy forehead ever bloom;</p>
<p>May'st thou, nor can I wish a greater curse;</p>
<p>Live full despis'd, and die without a nurse;</p>
<p>Or, if same wither'd hag, for sake of hire,</p>
<p>Should wash thy sheets, and cleanse thee from the mire,</p>
<p>Let her, when hunger peevishly demands</p>
<p>The dainty morsel from her barb'rous hands,</p>
<p>Insult, with hellish mirth, thy craving maw</p>
<p>And snatch it to herself, and call it law,</p>
<p>Till pinching famine waste thee to the bone</p>
<p>And break, at last, that solid heart of stone.</p>

<h3>NOSTALGIA&mdash;MALADIE DE PAYS&mdash;CALENTURE.</h3>

<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>


<p>This disease, according to Dr. Darwin,
is an unconquerable desire of returning to
one's native country, frequent in long
voyages, in which the patients become so
insane, as to throw themselves into the
sea, mistaking it for green fields or
meadows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>So, by a <i>calenture</i> misled,</p>
<p class="i2">The mariner with rapture sees,</p>
<p>On the smooth ocean's azure bed,</p>
<p class="i2">Enamell'd fields and verdant trees.</p>
<p>With eager haste he longs to rove</p>
<p class="i2">In that fantastic scene, and thinks</p>
<p>It must be some enchanting grove,</p>
<p class="i2">And in he leaps, and down he sinks.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>SWIFT.</p>
<br />

<p>The Swiss are said to be particularly
liable to this disease, and when taken into
foreign service, frequently to desert from
this cause, and especially after hearing or
singing a particular tune, which was used
in their village dances, in their native
country, on which account the playing or
singing this tune was forbidden by the
punishment of death.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Dear is that shed, to which his soul conforms,</p>
<p>And dear that hill, which lifts him to the storms."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>GOLDSMITH.</p>
<br />

<p>Rousseau says, "The celebrated Swiss
tune, called the <i>Rans des Vaches</i>, is an air,
so dear to the Swiss, that it was forbidden
under the pain of death to play it to the
troops, as it immediately drew tears from
them, and made those who heard it desert,
or die of what is called <i>la maladie de pays</i>,
so ardent a desire did it excite to return
to their native country. It is in vain to
seek in this air for energetic accents capable
of producing such astonishing effects,
for which strangers are unable to account
from the music, which is in itself uncouth
and wild. But it is from habit,
recollections, and a thousand circumstances
retraced in this tune by those natives
who hear it, and reminding them of
their country, former pleasures of their
youth, and all those ways of living, which
occasion a bitter reflection at having lost
them. Music, then, does not affect them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>
as music, but as a reminiscence. This
air, though always the same, no longer
produces the same effects at present as it
did upon the Swiss formerly; for having
lost their taste for their first simplicity,
they no longer regret its loss when reminded
of it. So true it is, that we must
not seek in physical causes the great
effects of sound upon the human heart."</p>

<p>This disease (says Dr. Winterbottom)
affects the natives of Africa as strongly
as it does those of Switzerland; it is even
more violent in its effects on the Africans,
and often impels them to dreadful acts of
suicide. Sometimes it plunges them into
a deep melancholy, which induces the unhappy
sufferers to end a miserable existence
by a more tedious, though equally
certain method, that of dirt eating.</p>

<p>Such is the powerful influence of the
lore of one's native country.</p>

<h3>SINGULAR CUSTOM OF THE SULTAN OF TURKEY.</h3>

<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>


<p>After the opening of the Bairam,<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> a
ceremony among the Turks, attended
with more than ordinary magnificence;
the Sultan, accompanied by the Grand
Signior and all the principal officers of
state, goes to exhibit himself to the people
in a kiosk, or tent near the seraglio
point, seated on a sofa of silver, brought
out for the occasion. It is a very large,
wooden couch covered with thick plates
of massive silver, highly burnished, and
there is little doubt from the form of it,
and the style in which it is ornamented
that it constituted part of the treasury of
the Greek emperors when Constantinople
was taken by the Turks.</p>

<h3>EL BORRACHO.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></h3>



<p>Not long since, a couple resided in the
suburbs of Madrid, named Perez and
Juana Donilla; and a happy couple they
might have been, had not Perez contracted
a sad habit of drinking, which became
more and more confirmed after every
draught of good wine; and such draughts
were certainly more frequent than his
finances were in a state to allow. Night
after night was spent at the tavern; fairly
might he be said to <i>swallow</i> all that he
earned by his daily labour; and Juana
and himself (fortunately they had no
children to maintain) must have been reduced
to absolute mendicity, but for the
exemplary conduct of the former, who
contrived to support her spouse and herself
upon the scanty produce of her unwearied
industry. If ever a sentiment of
gratitude for undeserved favours animated
the bosom of Perez Donilla, he took, it
must be confessed, a strange method of
declaring it; not only would he, upon his
return from his lawless carousals, grumble
over that humble fare, the possession of
which at all he ought to have considered
as scarce less than a miracle, but, in his
madness, unmerciful strappings were sure
to be the portion of his miserable wife.
Poor Juana bore these cruelties with a
patience that ought to have canonized her
under the title of St. Grizzle: she could
not, indeed, forbear crying out, under
these frequent and severe castigations;
nor could she refrain from soliciting the
aid of three or four favourite gentlemen
saints, who, little to the credit of their
gallantry and good-nature, always turned
a deaf ear upon her plaints and entreaties;
not a word, however, of the inhuman conduct
of her <i>worser</i> half did she breathe to
<i>mortal</i> ear. Neighbours, however, have
auricular organs like walls and little pitchers,
tongues like bells, and a spice of
meddling and mischief in them like asses;
so that no wise person will suppose the
conduct of Perez Donilla to his wife was
long a secret in Madrid. Juana had two
brothers and a cousin resident in the city&mdash;Gomez
Arias, chief cook to his reverence
the Canon Fernando; Hernan Arias,
head groom to Don Miguel de Corcoba, a
knight of Calatrava; and Pedro Pedrillo,
a young barber-surgeon, in business for
himself. Gomez and Hernan, hearing of
Juana's misfortunes, said, like affectionate
brothers. "God help our poor sister, and
may her own relations help her also; for
if <i>they</i> do not, nobody else will, and she
certainly can't help herself." The like
words they repeated to Pedro Pedrillo,
until he, being a sharp, handsome young
fellow, and particularly fond of showing
forth his fine person and finer wit, agreed
to visit his cousin, and contrive some plan
to extricate her from the cruelty of Perez.
Making himself, therefore, as fascinating
as possible, he marched directly to the
house, or rather cabin, of Juana Donilla,
and stood before her, smiling and watching
her small, thin fingers plaitting straw
for hats, some minutes ere she was aware
of his presence. "Pedro!" exclaimed
she, with a countenance and voice of pleasure,
as she recognised the intruder.&mdash;"Ay,
<i>Pedro</i> it is, indeed, Juana; but,
improved as <i>I</i> am. O, mercy upon me,
how black <i>you</i> are looking!"&mdash;"<i>Black</i>,
cousin? Nay, then, I'm sure 'tis not for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>
want of washing. Come, come, Pedro,
no jokes, if you please."&mdash;"By St. Jago,
fair cousin, I'm as far from a joke as I
am from a diploma; and my business in
this house, as in most houses, is no <i>jest</i>,
I assure you. In a word, the cries which
you utter when suffering from the insane
fury of your sottish husband have reached
even me, and I'm come to offer you a little
advice and assistance. No denial of the
fact, Juana; those black bruises avouch
it without a tongue."&mdash;Juana held down
her head, colour mounted into her cheeks,
tears suffused her eyes, her bosom heaved
convulsively, and for some moments she
was silent from confusion, shame, grief,
and gratitude. At length, withdrawing
her hand from the affectionate grasp of
Pedro, and dashing it athwart her eyes,
she looked up and said mildly, "Thanks,
many thanks, dear cousin, for your kindness.
I cannot dissemble with you; what
would you have me do? I could not
<i>beat</i> him in return; and, oh! save him
from the arm of my brothers!"&mdash;"What
have you always done?"&mdash;"Borne his
stripes, and called for help upon St. Jago,
St. Francis Xavier, St. Benedict, and St.
Nicholas!"&mdash;"And did you never invoke
the three holy Maries?"&mdash;"Never."&mdash;Then
that's what you ought to have done,"
returned Senor Pedrillo, with the utmost
gravity. "Now mind me,&mdash;call upon
<i>them</i> for aid next time your husband maltreats
you."&mdash;"Alas!" sighed the afflicted
wife, "<i>that</i> will most surely be
to-night. I've not much faith in your
remedy, Pedro; but may be there's no
harm in trying it."&mdash;"Farewell, then,
my poor, pretty, patient, black-bruised
cousin," cried Pedrillo; "next time you
see the <i>doctor</i>, let him know how his remedy
has sped;" and with a comical expression
of countenance, half melancholy,
half mirthful, the "trusty and well-beloved
cousin" departed.</p>

<p>Late that night, Perez Donilla entered
his own habitation as intoxicated and belligerent
as ever. "Where's my supper?"&mdash;"Here,"
said his wife, trembling, as
she placed before him a few heads of garlic,
a piece of salted trout, a little oil, and
a crust of barley bread. "What's all
this, woman?" exclaimed Perez, in a
voice of thunder; and with glaring eyes
and demoniacal fury he dashed the fish at
her head, and the rest of his supper upon
the floor. "Wretch! how durst <i>you</i>
fatten upon olios and ragouts, and set
trash like <i>this</i> before your <i>husband?</i>"&mdash;"My
dear," replied Juana, meekly, "I
am starving; nothing have I tasted since
breakfast."&mdash;"Don't lie, you jade!
Where's the wild-fowl and the Bologna
sausage sent you by that rogue, Gomez?
Stolen were they from the canon's kitchen,
and you know it! And where's the skin
of excellent Calcavella, from the Caballero's
overflowing vaults? Give it to me
this <i>instant</i>, you hussy, you vixen, you&mdash;"&mdash;"Indeed,
<i>indeed</i>," cried the unfortunate
wife in deep anguish, "I take
all the saints in heaven to witness&mdash;."&mdash;"That,
and that, and <i>that</i>," interrupted
the furious tyrant, lashing her severely,
according to custom, with a thick thong
of leather, and now and then adding a
blow with his fist; "let's see if <i>that</i> will
bring me a supper fit for a Christian, and
a draught of Don Miguel's Calcavella!"
Juana remembered Pedrillo's advice, and
after roaring out more loudly than usual
for aid from St. Jago, St. Francis, St.
Benedict, and St. Nicholas, shrieked at
the highest pitch of her voice, "May the
three blessed Maries help me!" No
sooner were the words uttered, than in
rushed three apparitions, arrayed in white,
but so enfolded in lined, that it was impossible
to determine whether they represented
men or women; of their visages,
only their eyes were visible, peering frightfully
from the white covering of their
heads; each brandished a good stout
cudgel, and each, without uttering a word,
falling quick as thought upon Perez Donilla,
repaid him the blows he had lavished
on his unhappy wife with such interest,
as would have sealed his fate indubitably,
had not she interposed; but upon the entreaties
of that exemplary wife, the three
holy Maries remitted the remainder of
their flagellation, and retired, leaving
Perez senseless on the floor. Poor Juana
was agonized at beholding the state to
which her graceless partner was reduced,
and hauling him, as well as her own exhausted
strength would permit, upon his
miserable pallet, washed the blood and dust
from his wounds, and watched his return
to consciousness with unexampled tenderness
and dutiful fidelity. Perez at length
opened his eyes, and said, in the mild
voice which was natural to him when sober,
"My poor Juana, I wish you could fetch
your cousin Pedro to see me; I think I
shall die." Juana was half distracted at
this speech; and running to the next
house, bribed a neighbour's child by the
promise of a broad-brimmed straw hat, to
shade his complexion from the sun, to
run for Doctor Pedrillo. Pedro soon
arrived, and was evidently more puzzled
respecting his deportment than the case of
his patient. Sundry "nods, and becks,
and wreathed smiles," and sundry eloquent
glances of his bright black eyes,
were covertly bestowed upon his <i>fair</i>
cousin; anon, with ludicrous solemnity,
he felt the pulse of Perez, shook his head,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>
and, in short, imitated with inimitable
exactness all the technical airs and graces
of a regular graduate of Salamanca.&mdash;"Cousin,"
cried he at length, with a sly
look at Juana, "I pity your plight&mdash;from
my soul I do; but your case is, I
am grieved to say, desperate, unless I am
informed of the <i>cause</i> of these monstrous
weals, bruises, slashes, and chafings, in
order that my prescription, may&mdash;"&mdash;"The
<i>cause</i> of them," said Perez,
almost frightened to death, "is, having
to my cost a <i>saint</i> of a wife."&mdash;"How!
that a <i>misfortune?</i> explain yourself, my
poor fellow."&mdash;"Readily," replied Donilla,
"if that will help to heal me."&mdash;He
then explained minutely the circumstances
of the case, concluding thus:&mdash;"Not
but what I am, after all, remarkably
indebted to Juana, for had she only
called the eleven thousand Virgins to her
assistance, their zeal would undoubtedly
have divided my body amongst them;
since, then, my wife has such friends in
heaven; I shall henceforth be careful how
I enrage them again."&mdash;Perez Donilla
kept to his resolution, and the <i>Three
Maries</i>, whom, without doubt, the intelligent
reader has recognised through their
disguise, lived for many years to rejoice
in the blessed effects of a severe, but merited
infliction.     M. L. B.</p>

<h3>CHURCH OF AUSTIN FRIARS.</h3>


<p>The church of Austin Friars is one of
the most ancient Gothic remains in the
City of London. It belonged to a priory
dedicated to St. Augustine, and was
founded for the friars Eremites of the
order of Hippo, in Africa, by Humphry
Bohun, Earl of Hereford and
Essex, 1253. A part of this once spacious
building was granted by Edward
VI. to a congregation of Germans and
other strangers, who fled hither from religious
persecutions. Several successive
princes have confirmed it to the Dutch,
by whom it has been used as a place of

<h3>DAUPHIN OF FRANCE.</h3>

<p>The heir apparent of the crown of France
derives his title of Dauphin from the following
very singular circumstance. In
1349, Hubert, second Count of Dauphiny,
being inconsolable for the loss of his heir
and only child, who had leaped from his
arms through a window of his palace at
Grenoble into the river Isere, entered into
a convent of jacobins, and ceded Dauphiny
to Philip, a younger son of Philip
of Valois (for 120,000 florins of gold
each of the value of twenty sols or ten
pence English,) on condition that the
eldest son of the king of France should
be always after styled "the Dauphin,"
from the name of the province thus ceded.
Charles V., grandson to Philip of Valois,
was the first who bore the title in 1530.</p>

<p>Everything connected with the name
of HOGARTH is interesting to the English
reader. He was apprenticed to a
silversmith, and from cutting cyphers on
silver spoons, he rose to be sergeant painter
to the king&mdash;and from engraving arms
and shop-bills, to painting kings and
queens&mdash;the very top of the artist's ladder.
The soul-breathing impulses of
genius enabled him to effect all this, and
his example, (in support of the maxim,
that "every man is the architect of his
own fortune,") will be respected and cherished,
at home and abroad, as long as
self-advancement continues to be the
great stimulus to aspiring industry.</p>

<p>The old Elephant public-house therefore
merits the attention of all lovers of
painting and genius; for in it, previous
to his celebrity, lodged WILLIAM HOGARTH.
It was built before the fire of
London, and although so near, escaped
its ravages; but the house was pulled
down a short time since, and another of
more commodious construction erected on
its site. On the wall of the tap-room, in
the old house, were four paintings by
Hogarth: one representing the Hudson's
Bay Company's Porters; another, his
first idea for the Modern Midnight Conversation,
(differing from the print in a
circumstance too broad in its humour for
the graver,) and another of Harlequin and
Pierot seeming to be laughing at the
figure in the last picture. On the first
floor was a picture of Harlow Bush Fair,
covered over with paint. This information
is copied from an old print picked up
in our "collecting" rambles, at the foot
of which it is stated to have been obtained
from "Mrs. Hibbert, who has
kept the house between thirty and forty
years, and received her information relating
to Mr. Hogarth from persons at that
time well acquainted with him." The
paintings were, we believe, removed previous
to the destruction of the old
house.</p>

<p>To the searchers into life and manners,
Hogarth's moral paintings, to which
branch of art the above belong, are treasures
of great prize; and whether over
his originals at the gallery in Pall Mall,
or their copies at the printsellers&mdash;the
Elephant in Fenchurch-street, or the
"painting moralist's" tomb in Chiswick
churchyard&mdash;Englishmen have just cause
to be proud of his name.</p>

<h3>AND LITERARY NOTICES OF <i>NEW WORKS</i></h3>


<hr />

<h3>DAYS DEPARTED; OR, BANWELL HILL:</h3>

<h4><i>A Lay of the Severn Sea, by the Rev.
W. Lisle Bowles.</i></h4>


<p>This is a delightful volume&mdash;full of nature
and truth&mdash;and in every respect
worthy of "one of the most elegant, pathetic,
and original living poets of England."
Moreover, it is just such a book
as we expected from the worthy vicar of
Bremhill; dedicated to the Bishop of
Bath and Wells; and dated from Bremhill
Parsonage, of which interesting abode
we inserted an unique description in our
last volume.</p>

<p>As our principal object is to give a few
of the <i>poetical pictures</i>, we shall be very
brief with the prose, and merely quote an
outline of the poem. Mr. Bowles, it appears,
is a native of the district in which
he resides, and this circumstance introduces
some beautiful retrospective feelings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">                   But awhile,</p>
<p>Here let me stand, and gaze upon the scene,</p>
<p>Array'd in living light around, and mark</p>
<p>The morning sunshine,&mdash;on that very shore</p>
<p>Where once a child I wander'd,&mdash;Oh! return</p>
<p>(I sigh,) "return a moment, days of youth,</p>
<p>Of childhood,&mdash;oh, return!"  How vain the thought,</p>
<p>Vain as unmanly! yet the pensive Muse,</p>
<p>Unblam'd, may dally with imaginings;</p>
<p>For this wide view is like the scene of life,</p>
<p>Once travers'd o'er with carelessness and glee,</p>
<p>And we look back upon the vale of years,</p>
<p>And hear remembered voices, and behold,</p>
<p>In blended colours, images and shades</p>
<p>Long pass'd, now rising, as at Memory's call,</p>
<p>Again in softer light.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The poem then proceeds with a description
of an antediluvian cave at Banwell,
and a brief sketch of events since
the deposit; but, as Mr. Bowles observes,
poetry and geological inquiry do not very
amicably travel together; we must, therefore,
soon get out of the cave:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">But issuing from the Cave&mdash;look round&mdash;behold</p>
<p>How proudly the majestic Severn rides</p>
<p>On the sea,&mdash;how gloriously in light</p>
<p>It rides! Along this solitary ridge,</p>
<p>Where smiles, but rare, the blue Campanula,</p>
<p>Among the thistles, and grey stones, that peep</p>
<p>Through the thin herbage&mdash;to the highest point</p>
<p>Of elevation, o'er the vale below,</p>
<p>Slow let us climb. First, look upon that flow'r</p>
<p>The lowly heath-bell, smiling at our feet.</p>
<p>How beautiful it smiles alone! The Pow'r,</p>
<p>that bade the great sea roar&mdash;that spread the Heav'ns&mdash;</p>
<p>That call'd the sun from darkness&mdash;deck'd that flow'r,</p>
<p>And bade it grace this bleak and barren hill.</p>
<p>Imagination, in her playful mood,</p>
<p>Might liken it to a poor village maid,</p>
<p>Lowly, but smiling in her lowliness,</p>
<p>And dress'd so neatly, as if ev'ry day</p>
<p>Were Sunday. And some melancholy Bard</p>
<p>Might, idly musing, thus discourse to it:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Daughter of Summer, who dost linger here.</p>
<p>Decking the thistly turf, and arid hill,</p>
<p>Unseen&mdash;let the majestic Dahlia</p>
<p>Glitter, an Empress, in her blazonry</p>
<p>Of beauty; let the stately Lily shine,</p>
<p>As snow-white as the breast of the proud Swan,</p>
<p>Sailing upon the blue lake silently,</p>
<p>That lifts her tall neck higher, as she views</p>
<p>The shadow in the stream! Such ladies bright</p>
<p>May reign unrivall'd, in their proud parterres!</p>
<p>Thou would'st not live with them; but if a voice,</p>
<p>Fancy, in shaping mood, might give to thee,</p>
<p>To the forsaken Primrose, thou would'st say,</p>
<p>'Come, live with me, and we two will rejoice:&mdash;</p>
<p>Nor want I company; for when the sea</p>
<p>Shines in the silent moonlight, elves and fays,</p>
<p>Gentle and delicate as Ariel,</p>
<p>That do their spiritings on these wild bolts&mdash;</p>
<p>Circle me in their dance, and sing such songs</p>
<p>As human ear ne'er heard!'"&mdash;But cease the strain,</p>
<p>Lest Wisdom, and severer Truth, should chide.</p>

<p>Next is a sketch of Steep Holms, introducing
the following exquisite episode:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">              Dreary; but on its steep</p>
<p>There is one native flower&mdash;the Piony.</p>
<p>She sits companionless, but yet not sad:</p>
<p>She has no sister of the summer-field,</p>
<p>That may rejoice with her when spring returns.</p>
<p>None, that in sympathy, may bend its head,</p>
<p>When the bleak winds blow hollow o'er the rock,</p>
<p>In autumn's gloom!&mdash;So Virtue, a fair flow'r,</p>
<p>Blooms on the rock of care, and though unseen,</p>
<p>It smiles in cold seclusion, and remote</p>
<p>From the world's flaunting fellowship, it wears</p>
<p>Like hermit Piety, that smile of peace,</p>
<p>In sickness, or in health, in joy or tears,</p>
<p>In summer-days, or cold adversity;</p>
<p>And still it feels Heav'n's breath, reviving, steal</p>
<p>On its lone breast&mdash;feels the warm blessedness</p>
<p>Of Heaven's own light about it, though its leaves</p>
<p>Are wet with ev'ning tears!</p>
<p class="i14">                  So smiles this flow'r:</p>
<p>And if, perchance, my lay has dwelt too long.</p>
<p>Upon one flower which blooms in privacy,</p>
<p>I may a pardon find from human hearts,</p>
<p>For such was my poor Mother!<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>We pass over some marine sketches,
which are worthy of the <i>Vernet</i> of poets,
a touching description of the sinking
of a packet-boat, and the first sound and
sight of the sea&mdash;the author's childhood
at Uphill Parsonage&mdash;his reminiscences
of the clock of Wells Cathedral&mdash;and some
real villatic sketches&mdash;a portrait of a
<i>Workhouse Girl</i>&mdash;some caustic remarks
on prosing and prig parsons, commentators,
and puritanical excrescences of sects&mdash;to
some unaffected lines on the village
school children of Castle-Combe, and
their annual festival. This is so charming
a picture of rural joy, that we must
copy it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">If we would see the fruits of charity.</p>
<p>Look at that village group, and paint the scene.</p>
<p>Surrounded by a clear and silent stream,</p>
<p>Where the swift trout shoots from the sudden ray,</p>
<p>A rural mansion, on the level lawn,</p>
<p>Uplifts its ancient gables, whose slant shade</p>
<p>Is drawn, as with a line, from roof to porch,</p>
<p>Whilst all the rest is sunshine. O'er the trees</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>
<p>In front, the village-church, with pinnacles,</p>
<p>And light grey tow'r, appears, while to the right</p>

<p>And see, an infant troop, with flags and drum,</p>
<p>Are marching o'er that bridge, beneath the woods,</p>
<p>On&mdash;to the table spread upon the lawn,</p>
<p>Raising their little hands when grace is said;</p>
<p>Whilst she, who taught them to lift up their hearts</p>
<p>In prayer, and to "remember, in their youth,"</p>
<p>God, "their Creator,"&mdash;mistress of the scene,</p>
<p>(Whom I remember once, as young,) looks on,</p>
<p>Blessing them in the silence of her heart.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And, children, now rejoice,&mdash;</p>
<p>Now&mdash;for the holidays of life are few;</p>
<p>Nor let the rustic minstrel tune, in vain,</p>
<p>The crack'd church-viol, resonant to-day,</p>
<p>Of mirth, though humble! Let the fiddle scrape</p>
<p>Its merriment, and let the joyous group</p>
<p>Dance, in a round, for soon the ills of life</p>
<p>Will come! Enough, if one day in the year,</p>
<p>If one brief day, of this brief life, be given</p>
<p>To mirth as innocent as yours!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then we have an "aged widow" reading
"GOD'S own Word" at her cottage-door,
with her daughter kneeling beside
her&mdash;a sketch from those halcyon days,
when, in the beautiful allegory of Scripture,
"every man sat under his own fig-tree."
This is followed by the "Elysian
Tempe of Stourhead," the seat of Sir
Richard Colt Hoare, to whose talents and
benevolence Mr. Bowles pays a merited
tribute. Longleat, the residence of the
Bishop of Bath and Wells, succeeds; and
Marston, the abode of the Rev. Mr. Skurray,
a friend of the author from his
"youthful days," introduces the following
beautiful descriptive snatch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<p>Cities and spires, beneath the mountains blue,</p>

<p>Or heard the roaring of the cataract.</p>
<p>Far off,<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> beneath the dark defile or gloom</p>

<p>Upon the eye-lids of a village-child!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>This is succeeded by a poetic panorama
of views from the Severn to Bristol, introducing
a solitary ship at sea&mdash;and the
"solitary sand:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">No sound was heard,</p>

<p>A picture of Bristol is succeeded by
some scenes of great picturesque beauty&mdash;as
Wrington, the birth-place of the immortal

<p>Langhorne, a pastor and a poet too;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and Barley-Wood, the seat of Mrs. Hannah
More. Mr. Bowles also tells us that
the music of "Auld Robin Gray" was
composed by Mr. Leaver, rector of Wrington;
and then adds a complimentary ballad
to Miss Stephens on the above air&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Sung by a maiden of the South, whose look&mdash;</p>
<p>(Although her song be sweet)&mdash;whose look, whose life,</p>
<p>Is sweeter than her song.</p>

<p>The last Part (IV.) contains some exquisite
Sonnets, and the poem concludes
with a "Vision of the Deluge," and the
ascent of the Dove of the ark&mdash;in which
are many sublime touches of the mastery
of poetry. There are nearly forty pages
of Notes, for whose "lightness" and
garrulity Mr. Bowles apologizes.</p>

<p>Altogether, we have been much gratified
with the present work. It contains
poetry after our own heart&mdash;the poetry of
nature and of truth&mdash;abounding with
tasteful and fervid imagery, but never
drawing too freely on the stores of fancy
for embellishment. We could detach
many passages that have charmed and
fascinated us in out reading; but one
must suffice for an epigrammatic exit:&mdash;</p>

<h3>SCENERY OF THE OHIO.</h3>


<p>The heart must indeed be cold that would
not glow among scenes like these. Rightly
did the French call this stream <i>La Belle
Rivire</i>, (the beautiful river.) The
sprightly Canadian, plying his oar in cadence
with the wild notes of the boat-song,
could not fail to find his heart enlivened
by the beautiful symmetry of the
Ohio. Its current is always graceful, and
its shores every where romantic. Every
thing here is on a large scale. The eye
of the traveller is continually regaled with
magnificent scenes. Here are no pigmy
mounds dignified with the name of mountains,
no rivulets swelled into rivers. Nature
has worked with a rapid but masterly
hand; every touch is bold, and the whole
is grand as well as beautiful; while room
is left for art to embellish and fertilize
that which nature has created with a thousand
capabilities. There is much sameness
in the character of the scenery; but
that sameness is in itself delightful, as it
consists in the recurrence of noble traits,
which are too pleasing ever to be viewed
with indifference; like the regular features
which we sometimes find in the face of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
lovely woman, their charm consists in
their own intrinsic gracefulness, rather
than in the variety of their expressions.
The Ohio has not the sprightly, fanciful
wildness of the Niagara, the St. Lawrence,
or the Susquehanna, whose impetuous
torrents, rushing over beds of rocks, or
dashing against the jutting cliffs, arrest
the ear by their murmurs, and delight the
eye with their eccentric wanderings. Neither
is it like the Hudson, margined at
one spot by the meadow and the village,
and overhung at another by threatening
precipices and stupendous mountains. It
has a wild, solemn, silent sweetness, peculiar
to itself. The noble stream, clear,
smooth, and unruffled, swept onward with
regular majestic force. Continually changing
its course, as it rolls from vale to vale,
it always winds with dignity, and avoiding
those acute angles, which are observable
in less powerful streams, sweeps
round in graceful bends, as if disdaining
the opposition to which nature forces it to
submit. On each side rise the romantic
hills, piled on each other to a tremendous
height; and between them are deep, abrupt,
silent glens, which at a distance
seem inaccessible to the human foot;
while the whole is covered with timber of
a gigantic size, and a luxuriant foliage of
the deepest hues. Throughout this scene
there is a pleasing solitariness, that speaks
peace to the mind, and invites the fancy
to soar abroad, among the tranquil haunts
of meditation. Sometimes the splashing
of the oar is heard, and the boatman's
song awakens the surrounding echoes;
but the most usual music is that of the
native songsters, whose melody steals
pleasingly on the ear, with every modulation,
at all hours, and in every change of
situation.&mdash;<i>Hon. Judge Hall's Letters
from the West</i>.</p>

<h3>SNOW-WOMAN'S STORY.</h3>

<h4>By Miss Edgeworth.</h4>


<p>"Yes, madam, I bees an Englishwoman,
though so low now and untidy like&mdash;it's
a shame to think of it&mdash;a Manchester woman,
ma'am&mdash;and my people was once
in a bettermost sort of way&mdash;but sore
pinched latterly." She sighed, and paused.</p>

<p>"I married an Irishman, madam,"
continued she, and sighed again.</p>

<p>"I hope he gave you no reason to
sigh," said Gerald's father.</p>

<p>"Ah, no, sir, never!" answered the
Englishwoman, with a faint sweet smile.
"Brian Dermody is a good man, and
was always a koind husband to me, as
far and as long as ever he could, I will
say that&mdash;but my friends misliked him&mdash;no
help for it. He is a soldier, sir,&mdash;of
the forty-fifth. So I followed my husband's
fortins, as nat'ral, through the
world, till he was ordered to Ireland.
Then he brought the children over, and
settled us down there at Bogafin in a
little shop with his mother&mdash;a widow.
She was very koind too. But no need to
tire you with telling all. She married
again, ma'am, a man young enough to
be her son&mdash;a nice man he was to look at
too&mdash;a gentleman's servant he had been.
Then they set up in a public-house.
Then the whiskey, ma'am, that they bees
all so fond of&mdash;he took to drinking it in
the morning even, ma'am&mdash;and that was
bad, to my thinking."</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed!" said Molly, with a
groan of sympathy; "oh the whiskey!
if men could keep from it!"</p>

<p>"And if women could!" said Mr.
Crofton in a low voice.</p>

<p>The Englishwoman looked up at him,
and then looked down, refraining from
assent to his smile.</p>

<p>"My mother-in-law," continued she,
"was very koind to me all along, as far
as she could. But one thing she could
not do; that was, to pay me back the
money of husband's and mine that I lent
her. I thought this odd of her&mdash;and
hard. But then I did not know the ways
of the country in regard to never paying
debts."</p>

<p>"Sure it's not the ways of all Ireland,
my dear," said Molly; "and it's only
them that has not that can't pay&mdash;how
can they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;it's not for me to say,"
said the Englishwoman, reservedly; "I
am a stranger. But I thought if they
could not pay me, they need not have kept
a jaunting-car."</p>

<p>"Is it a jaunting-car?" cried Molly.
She pushed from her the chair on which
she was leaning&mdash;"Jaunting-car bodies!
and not to pay you!&mdash;I give them up intirely.
Ill-used you were, my poor Mrs.
Dermody&mdash;and a shame! and you a stranger!
But them were Connaught people.
I ask your pardon&mdash;finish your story."</p>

<p>"It is finished, ma'am. They were
ruined, and all sold; and I could not stay
with my children to be a burthen. I
wrote to husband, and he wrote me word
to make my way to Dublin, if I could, to
a cousin of his in Pill-lane&mdash;here's the
direction&mdash;and that if he can get leave
from his colonel, who is a good gentleman,
he will be over to settle me somewhere, to
get my bread honest in a little shop, or
some way. I am used to work and hard-*ship;
so I don't mind. Brian was very
koind in his letter, and sent me all he
had&mdash;a pound, ma'am&mdash;and I set out
on my journey on foot, with the three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
children. The people on the road were
very koind and hospitable indeed; I have
nothing to say against the Irish for that;
they are more hospitabler a deal than in
England, though not always so honest.
Stranger as I was, I got on very well till
I came to the little village here hard by,
where my poor boy that is gone first fell
sick of the measles. His sickness, and the
'pot'ecary' stuff and all, and the lodging
and living ran me very low. But I paid
all, every farthing; and let none know
how poor I was, for I was ashamed, you
know, ma'am, or I am sure they would
have helped me, for they are a koind
people, I will say that for them, and
ought so to do, I am sure. Well, I
pawned some of my things, my cloak
even, and my silk bonnet, to pay honest;
and as I could not do no otherwise, I left
them in pawn, and, with the little money
I raised, I set out forwards on my road to
Dublin again, so soon as I thought my
boy was able to travel. I reckoned too
much upon his strength. We had got
but a few miles from the village when he
dropped, and could not get on; and I was
unwilling and ashamed to turn back, having
so little to pay for lodgings. I saw a
kind of hut, or shed, by the side of a hill.
There was nobody in it. It was empty
of every thing but some straw, and a few
turf, the remains of a fire. I thought
there would be no harm in taking shelter
in it for my children and myself for the
night. The people never came back to
whom it belonged, and the next day my
poor boy was worse; he had a fever this
time. Then the snow came on. We had
some little store of provisions that had
been made up for us for the journey to
Dublin, else we must have perished when
we were snowed up. I am sure the people
in the village never know'd that we were
in that hut, or they would have come to
help us, for they bees very koind people.
There must have been a day and a night
that passed, I think, of which I know
nothing. It was all a dream. When I
got up from my illness, I found my boy
dead&mdash;and the others with famished looks.
Then I had to see them faint with hunger."</p>

<p>The poor woman had told her story
without any attempt to make it pathetic,
and thus far without apparent emotion or
change of voice; but when she came to
this part, and spoke of her children, her
voice changed and failed&mdash;she could only
add, looking at Gerald, "You know the
rest, master; Heaven bless you!"</p>

<h2>THE COSMOPOLITE.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>ENGLISH GARDENS.</h3>


<p>We are veritable sticklers for old customs;
and accordingly at this season of
the year, have our room decorated with
holly and other characteristic evergreens.
For the last hour we have been seated
before a fine bundle of these festive trophies;
and, strange as it may seem, this
circumstance gave rise to the following
paper. The holly reminded us of the
Czar Peter spoiling the garden-hedge at
Sayes Court; this led us to John Evelyn,
the father of English gardening: and the
laurels drove us into shrubbery nooks,
and all the retrospections of our early
days, and above all to our early love of
gardens. Our enthusiasm was then unaffected
and uninfluenced by great examples;
we had neither heard nor read of
Lord Bacon nor Sir William Temple, nor
any other illustrious writer on gardening;
but this love was the pure offspring of our
own mind and heart. Planting and transplanting
were our delight; the seed which
our tiny hands let fall into the bosom of
the earth, we almost watched peeping
through little clods, after the kind and
quickening showers of spring; and we
regarded the germinating of an upturned
bean with all the surprise and curiosity
of our nature. As we grew in mind and
stature, we learned the loftier lessons of
philosophy, and threw aside the "Pocket
Gardener," for the sublime chapters of
Bacon and Temple; and as the stream
of life carried us into its vortex, we learned
to contemplate their pages as the living
parterres of a garden, and their bright
imageries as fascinating flowers. As we
journeyed onward through the busy herds
of crowded cities, we learned the holier
influences of gardens in reflecting that a
garden has been the scene of man's birth&mdash;his
fall&mdash;and proffered redemption.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a subject
which has been more fervently treated by
poets and philosophers, than the <i>love of
gardens</i>. In old Rome, poets sung of
their gardens. Ovid is so fond of flowers,
that in his account of the Rape of Proserpine,
in his Fasti, he devotes several
lines to the enumeration of flowers gathered
by her attendants. But the passion
for gardening, which evidently came from
the East, never prevailed much in Europe
till the times of the religious orders, who
greatly improved it.</p>

<p>Our anecdotical recollections of the
taste for gardens must be but few, or
they will carry us beyond our limits.
Lord Bacon appears to have done more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
towards their encouragement than any
other writer, and his essay on gardens
is too well known to admit of quotation.
Sir William Temple has, however,
many eloquent passages in his writings,
in one of which he calls <i>gardening</i> the
"inclination of kings, the choice of philosophers,
and the common favourite of
public and private men; a pleasure of
the greatest, and the care of the meanest;
and, indeed, an employment and a possession,
for which no man is too high or too
low." Perhaps John Evelyn did more
than either of these philosophers. Temple's
garden at Moor Park was one of the
most beautiful of its kind; but at the
time when Evelyn introduced ornamental
gardening into England, there were no
examples for imitation. All was devised
by his own active mind; and in the political
storms of his time, his garden and
plantations became subjects of popular
conversation; while the intervals of his
secession from public life were filled up
in writing several practical treatises on his
favourite science. At Wotton, in Surrey,
may be seen the large, enclosed
flower-garden, which was to have formed
one of the principal objects in his "Elysium
Britannicum;" and this idea has
been partly realized by one of his successors.</p>

<p>Andrew Marvell has, however, anathematized
gardens with much severity, in
some lines entitled "The Mower against
Gardens;" and commencing thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use,</p>
<p class="i2">Did after him the world seduce,</p>
<p>And from the fields the flowers and plants allure,</p>
<p class="i2">Where nature was most plain and pure.</p>
<p>He first enclos'd within the garden's square</p>
<p class="i2">A dead and standing pool of air;</p>
<p>And a more luscious earth from them did knead,</p>
<p class="i2">Which stupify'd them while it fed, &amp;c,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>On the other side, old Gerarde asks
his courteous and well-willing readers&mdash;"Whither
do all men walk for their
honest recreation, but where the earth has
most beneficially painted her face with
flourishing colours? and what season of
the year more longed for than the spring,
whose gentle breath entices forth the
kindly sweets, and makes them yield
their fragrant smells." Lord Bacon, too,
thus fondly dwells on part of its allurements:&mdash;"That
flower, which above all
others yields the sweetest smell in the air,
is the violet. Next to that is the musk-rose,
then the strawberry leaves, dying
with a most excellent cordial smell.
Then sweet briars, then wall flowers,
which are very delightful to be set under
a parlour, or lower chamber window.
But those which perfume the air most delightfully,
not passed by as the rest, but
being trodden upon and crushed, are
three, that is burner, wild thyme, and
water mints. Therefore, you are to set
whole alleys of them, to have the pleasure
where you walk or tread." Sir William
Temple says Epicurus studied, exercised,
and taught his philosophy in his
garden. Milton, we know, passed many
hours together in his garden at Chalfont;
Cowley poured forth the greatness of his
soul in his rural retreat at Chertsey; and
Lord Shaftesbury wrote his "Characteristics,"
at a delightful spot near Reigate.
Pope, in one of his letters, says, "I am
in my garden, amused and easy; this is
a scene where one finds no disappointment;"&mdash;and
within the same neighbourhood, Thomson</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Sung the Seasons and their change."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>England can likewise boast of very
great names who have been attached to
this art, though they have not written on
the subject. Lord Burleigh, Sir Walter
Raleigh, Lord Capell, William III&mdash;for
Switzer tells us, that "in the least interval
of ease, gardening took up a great
part of his time, in which he was not only
a delighter, but likewise a great judge,"&mdash;the
Earl of Essex, whom Lord William
Russell said "was the worthiest, the
justest, the sincerest, and the most concerned
for the public, of any man he
ever knew;" Lord William Russell too,
who, as Switzer tells us, "made Stratton,
about seven miles from Winchester,
his seat, and his gardens there were some
of the best that were made in those early
days, such indeed as have mocked some
that have been done since, and the gardens
at Southampton House, in Bloomsbury
Square, were also of his making."
Henry, Earl of Danby, the Earl of Gainsborough,
"the <i>Maecenas</i> of his age," the
Earl of Halifax, the friend of Addison,
Swift, Pope, and Steele; Lord Weymouth,
of Longleate; Dr. Sherard, of
Eltham; the Earl of Scarborough, an
accomplished nobleman, immortalized by
Pope, and by the fine pen of Chesterfield;
and the Duke of Argyle, with numerous
other men of rank and science, have
highly assisted in elevating gardening to
the station it has long since held.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>


<p>Beauty and health are the attributes of
gardening. In illustration of the former,
we remember a passage from Gervase
Markham, thus: "As in the composition
of a delicate woman the grace of her
cheeke is the mixture of red and white,
the wonder of her eye blacke and white,
and the beauty of her hand blew and
white, any of which is not said to be
beautifull if it consist of single or simple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>
colours; and so in walkes or alleyes, the
all greene, nor the all yellow, cannot be
said to be most beautifull; but the greene
and yellow, (that is to say the untroade
grasse, and the well-knit gravelle) being
equally mixt, give the eye both lustre
and delight beyond comparison." Abercrombie
lived to the age of <i>eighty</i>, when
he died by a fall down stairs in the dark.
He was present at the battle of Preston
Pans, which was fought close to his father's
garden walls. For the last twenty
years he lived chiefly on tea, using it
three times a-day; his pipe was his first
companion in the morning, and last at
night. He never remembered to have
taken a dose of physic in his life; prior
to his last fatal accident, nor of having a
day's illness but once."</p>

<p>The association of gardening with pastoral
poetry, was exemplified in Shenstone's
design of the Leasowes&mdash;as Mr.
Whately observes&mdash;a perfect picture of
his mind, simple, elegant, and amiable,
and which will always suggest a doubt
whether the spot inspired his verses, or
whether in the scenes which he formed,
he only realized the pastoral images
which abound in his songs. That elegant
trifler, Horace Walpole, was enthusiastically
fond of gardening. One day
telling his nurseryman that he would
have his trees planted irregularly, he replied,
"Yes, sir, I understand; you
would have them hung down&mdash;somewhat
<i>poetical</i>."</p>

<h2>NOTES OF A READER.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>PORTRAIT OF SIR WALTER SCOTT.</h3>


<p>Appended to a fine portrait of Sir Walter
Scott, in the <i>Literary Souvenir</i> for
1829, is the following&mdash;by <i>Barry Cornwall</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>We can scarcely imagine a thing much
more pleasant indeed, to an artist, than
to be brought face to face with some
famous person, and permitted to examine
and scrutinize his features, with that careful
and intense curiosity, that seems necessary
to the perfecting a likeness. It
must have been to Raffaelle, at once a
relaxation from his ordinary study, and a
circumstance interesting in itself, thus to
look into faces so full of meaning as those
of Julius and Leo&mdash;and to say, "That
look&mdash;that glance, which seems so transient,
will I fix for ever. Thus shall he
be seen, with that exact expression (although
it lasted but for an instant) five
hundred years after he shall be dust and
ashes!"</p>

<p>This was probably the feeling of
Raffaelle; and it must have been with a
somewhat similar pride that our excellent
artist, Mr. Leslie, accomplished his
portrait of Sir Walter Scott, which the
reader will have already admired in this
volume. It is surely a perfect work. No
one, who has once seen the great author,
can forget that strange and peculiar look
(so full of meaning, and shrewd and cautious
observation&mdash;so entirely characteristic,
in short, of the mind within) which
Mr. Leslie has succeeded in catching.
One may gaze on it for ever, and contemplate
an exhaustless subject&mdash;all that the
capacious imagination has produced and
is producing,&mdash;the populous, endless
world of fancy.</p>

<p>Let the reader look, and be assured
that <i>there</i> is the strange spirit that has
discovered and wrought all the fine
shapes that he has been accustomed to
look upon with wonder&mdash;Claverhouse,
and Burley, and Bothwell,&mdash;Meg Merrilies
and Elspeth&mdash;the high and the low&mdash;the
fierce and the fair&mdash;Cavaliers and
Covenanters, and the rest&mdash;presenting an
assemblage of character that is absolutely
unequalled, except in the pages of Shakspeare
alone. There is no other writer,
be he Greek, or Goth, or Roman, who
has ever astonished the world by creations
so infinitely diversified. The mind
of the author appears so free from egotism,
so large and serene, so clear of all
images of self, that it receives, as in a
lucid mirror, all the varieties of nature.</p>

<p class="i2">Like death it almost seems:</p>

<h3>EPICURES.</h3>


<p>As a mere untravelled practical Englishman,
and, moreover, of the old school,
Quin, no doubt, ranks high in the lists
of gastronomy: but he is completely distanced
by many moderns, both in love
for and knowledge of the science. Among
the most noted of the moderns we beg to
introduce our readers to Mr. Rogerson, an
enthusiast and a martyr. He, as may be
presumed, was educated at that University
where the rudiments of palatic science
are the most thoroughly impressed
on the ductile organs of youth. His father,
a gentleman of Gloucestershire,
sent him abroad to make the grand tour,
upon which journey, says our informant,
young Rogerson attended to nothing but
the various modes of cookery, and methods
of eating and drinking luxuriously.
Before his return his father died, and he
entered into the possession of a very large
monied fortune, and a small landed estate.
He was now able to look over his notes of
epicurism, and to discover where the
most exquisite dishes were to be had, and
the best cooks procured. He had no other
servants in his house than men cooks;
his butler, footman, housekeeper, coachman,
and grooms, were all cooks. He
had three Italian cooks, one from Florence,
another from Sienna, and a third
from Viterbo, for dressing one dish, the
<i>docce piccante</i> of Florence.  He had a
messenger constantly on the road between
Brittany and London, to bring him the
eggs of a certain sort of plover, found
near St. Maloes. He has eaten a single
dinner at the expense of fifty-eight
pounds, though himself only sat down to
it, and there were but two dishes. He
counted the minutes between meals, and
seemed totally absorbed in the idea, or in
the action of eating, yet his stomach was
very small; it was the exquisite flavour
alone, that he sought. In nine years he
found his table dreadfully abridged by the
ruin of his fortune; and himself hastening
to poverty. This made him melancholy,
and brought on disease. When
totally ruined, having spent near 150,000l.,
a friend gave him a guinea to keep him
from starving; and he was found in a
garret soon after roasting an ortolan with
his own hands. We regret to add, that
a few days afterwards, this extraordinary
youth shot himself. We hope that his
notes are not lost to the dining world.</p>

<h3>COLLEGE DREAMS.</h3>


<p>How often in senior common-rooms may
be marked the gradual dropping asleep
of the learned and venerable members!
First, after a few rounds of the bottle,
the tongues, which are tired of eulogizing
or vituperating the various dishes which
had smoked upon the board, gradually
begin to be still,&mdash;soon conversation
comes absolutely to a stand,&mdash;the candles
grow alarmingly long in the wick,&mdash;comparative
darkness involves the sage assembly,&mdash;and
first one, then another,
drops off into a placid and harmonious repose.
Then what dreams float before the
eyes of their imagination! Blue silk
pelisses jostling shovel hats, church spires
dancing in most admired disorder, fat
incumbents falling down in a fit, neat
clerical-looking gigs standing at vicarage
doors, and these all incongruously commingled
with white veils, lawn sleeves,
roast beef, pulpit cushions, bright eyes,
and small black sarsnet shoes. Suddenly
the chapel bell dissolves the fleeting fabric
of the vision; and, behold! the white
veil is a poet's imagination, the church
spire is still at a miserable distance, the
vicarage is a Utopian nonentity, and the
fat incumbent, in a state of the ruddiest
health, is the only reality of the dream.</p>

<hr />

<h3>WOMAN</h3>


<p>Nothing sets so wide a mark "between
the vulgar and the noble seed" as the
respect and reverential love of womanhood.
A man who is always sneering at woman
is generally a coarse profligate, or a coarse
bigot, no matter which.</p>

<hr />

<h3>ANGLING.</h3>

<p>We have often thought that angling
alone offers to man the degree of half-business,
half-idleness, which the fair sex
find in their needle-work or knitting,
which, employing the hands, leaves the
mind at liberty, and occupying the attention
so far as is necessary to remove the
painful sense of a vacuity, yet yields
room for contemplation, whether upon
things heavenly or earthly, cheerful or
melancholy.&mdash;<i>Quarterly Rev.</i></p>

<h3>LAUGHTER.</h3>


<p>"Laugh and grow fat," is an old adage;
and Sterne tells us, that every time a
man laughs, he adds something to his
life. An eccentric philosopher, of the
last century, used to say, that he liked
not only to laugh himself, but to see
laughter, and hear laughter. "Laughter,
Sir, laughter is good for health; it
is a provocative to the appetite, and a
friend to digestion. Dr. Sydenham, Sir,
said the arrival of a merry-andrew in a
town was more beneficial to the health of
the inhabitants than twenty asses loaded
with medicine." Mr. Pott used to say
that he never saw the "Tailor riding to
Brentford," without feeling better for a
week afterwards.</p>


<hr />

<h3>LEGAL PEARL-DIVERS.</h3>


<p>Every barrister can "shake his head,"
and too often, like Sheridan's Lord Burleigh,
it is the only proof he vouchsafes
of his wisdom. Curran used to call
these fellows "legal pearl-divers."&mdash;"You
may observe them," he would say,
"their heads barely under water&mdash;their
eyes shut, and an index floating behind
them, displaying the precise degree of
their purity and their depth."</p>


<hr />

<h3>GRAMMATICAL LEARNING.</h3>


<p>An author left a comedy with Foote for
perusal; and on the next visit asked for
his judgment on it, with rather an ignorant
degree of assurance. "If you looked
a little more to the grammar of it, I
think," said Foote, "it would be better."&mdash;"To
the grammar of it, Sir! What!
would you send me to school again?"&mdash;"And
pray, Sir," replied Foote, very
gravely, "would that do you any
harm?"</p>


<hr />

<h3>SWEARING BY PROXY.</h3>


<p>Cardinal Dubois used frequently, in
searching after any thing he wanted, to
swear excessively. One of his clerks
told him, "Your eminence had better
hire a man to swear for you, and then
you will gain so much time."</p>


<hr />

<h3>THE MUNIFICENT SAINT.</h3>


<p>A devout lady offered up a prayer to
St. Ignatius for the conversion of her
husband; a few days after, the man
died; "What a good saint is our Ignatius!"
exclaimed the consolable widow,
"he bestows on us more benefits than we
ask for!"</p>


<hr />

<h3>PRODIGALITY.</h3>


<p>A petty journalist was boasting in company,
that he was a dispenser of fame to
those on whom he wrote. "Yes, Sir,"
replied an individual present, "you dispense
it so liberally, that you leave none
for yourself."</p>


<hr />

<h3>PHYSIOGNOMISTS.</h3>


<p>Pickpockets and beggars are the best
practical physiognomists, without having
read a line of Lavater, who, it is notorious,
mistook a highwayman for a philosopher,
and a philosopher for a highwayman.</p>


<hr />

<h3>EPITAPH</h3>


<p>In the Broadway churchyard, Westminster,
on three children, who all died very
early, the eldest being little more than
three years of age:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three children, not dead, but sleeping lies,</p>
<p>With Christ they live above the skies,</p>
<p>Wash'd in his blood, and for his dress,</p>
<p>Christ's glorious robe of righteousness,</p>
<p>In which they shine more bright by far</p>
<p>Than sun, or moon, or morning star;</p>
<p>In Paradise they wing their way,</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
