<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<div class="text">
<p  class="first">It began with Jerry&rsquo;s finishing off all the
olives that were left, &ldquo;like a pig would
do,&rdquo; as Greg said. His finishing the olives
left us the bottle, of course, and there is
only one natural thing to do with an empty
olive-bottle when you&rsquo;re on a water picnic.
That is, to write a message as though you
were a shipwrecked mariner, and seal it up
in the bottle and chuck it as far out as ever
you can.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d all gone over to Wecanicut on the
ferry,&mdash;Mother and Aunt Ailsa and Jerry
and Greg and I,&mdash;and we were picnicking
beside the big fallen-over slab that
looks just like the entrance to a pirate
cave. We had a fire, of course, and a lot
of things to eat, including the olives, which
were a fancy addition bought by Aunt
Ailsa as we were running for the ferry.</p>

<p>When we asked her if she had any paper,
she tore a perfectly nice leaf out of her
sketch-book, and gave me her 3 B drawing-pencil
to write with. It was very soft, and
the paper was the roughish kind that
comes in sketch-books, so that the writing
was smeary and looked quite as if shipwrecked
mariners had written it with
charred twigs out of the fire. We&rsquo;d
done lots of messages when we were on
other water picnics, but we&rsquo;d never heard
from any of them, although one reason
for that was that we never put our address
on them. We decided we would this time,
because Jerry had just been reading about
a fisherman in Newfoundland picking up
a message that somebody had chucked
from a yacht in the Gulf of Mexico months
and months before.</p>

<p>I wrote the date at the top, near the raggedy
place where the leaf was torn out
of Aunt Ailsa&rsquo;s sketch-book, and then I
put, &ldquo;We be Three Poore Mariners,&rdquo; like
the song in &ldquo;Pan-Pipes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jerry and Greg kept telling me things to
write, till the page was quite full and went
something like this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We be Three Poore Mariners, cast away upon the lone and
desolate shore of Wecanicut, an island in the Atlantic Ocean, lat.
and long. unknown. Our position is very perilous, as we have
exhausted all our supplies, including large stores of olives, and
are now forced to exist on beach-peas, barnacles,
and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eiligugs&rsquo; eggs,&rdquo; said Greg, dreamily.</p>

<p>Jerry pounced on him and said they only
grew on the Irish coast, but I said:
&ldquo;All right! Beach-peas, barnacles, and
eiligugs&rsquo; eggs, of which only a small supply
is to be had on this bleak and dismal
coast. Our ship, the good ferry-boat
<i>Wecanicut</i>, left us marooned, and there is
no hope of our being picked up for the next
two hours. Any person finding this message,
please come to our assistance by
dropping us a line,&rdquo; (I must honestly say
that this was Jerry&rsquo;s, and much better than
usual) &ldquo;as the surf is too heavy for boats
to land on this end of the island.
Signed:&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sign it &lsquo;Christine&rsquo;,&rdquo; Jerry
said. &ldquo;Put &lsquo;Chris,&rsquo; if we&rsquo;re to be real
mariners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I put &ldquo;Chris Holford, &aelig;t. 13,&rdquo; which I
thought might look more dignified and scholarly than
&ldquo;aged,&rdquo; and Jerry wrote &ldquo;Gerald M. Holford,&rdquo;
and put &ldquo;&aelig;t. 11&rdquo; after it, but I&rsquo;m sure he
didn&rsquo;t know what it meant until I did it. Then we stuck
the paper at Greg, and he stared at it ever
so long and finally said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ate eleven! He ate lots more than
that; I saw him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jerry pounced again,&mdash;I was laughing
too hard to,&mdash;and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not olives, silly; it&rsquo;s an abbreviated
French way of saying how old we
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I had to pounce on <i>him</i>, and tell
him it was Latin, as he might know by the
diphthong. By that time Greg had written
&ldquo;Gregory Holford, Ate 8,&rdquo; across the
bottom, very large, and Jerry said he
might as well have put 88 and had done
with it. We folded the paper up in the
tinfoil that the chocolate came in and
jammed it into the bottle and pounded the
cork in tight with a stone. Greg was all
for chucking it immediately, but Jerry said
it would have a better chance if we
dropped it right into the current from the
ferry going home. So we cocked the bottle
up on a rock and went back to the
pirate-cave-entrance place to finish a
game of smugglers.</p>

<p>Wecanicut is a nice place to smuggle
and do other dark deeds in, and I don&rsquo;t believe
we&rsquo;ll ever be too old to think it&rsquo;s
fun. This time we cut the rest of the tinfoil
into roundish pieces with Jerry&rsquo;s jackknife,
and stowed them into a cranny in
the cave. They shone rather faintly and
looked exactly like double moidores, except
that those are gold, I think. We also
borrowed Aunt Ailsa&rsquo;s hatpin with the
Persian coin on the end. By running the
pin down into the sand all the way, you
can make it look just like a goldpiece lying
on the floor of the cave. She is a very
obliging aunt and doesn&rsquo;t mind our doing
this sort of thing,&mdash;in fact, she plays lots
of the games, too, and she can groan more
hollowly than any of us, when groans are
needed.</p>

<p>This time we didn&rsquo;t ask her to, because
she was reading a book by H.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Wells to
Mother, and anyway all our proceedings
were supposed to be going on in the most
Stealthy and Silent Secrecy. The moidores
and the Persian coin were all that
was left of an enormous lot of things
which the villainous band had buried,&mdash;golden
chains, and uncut jewels, and pots
of louis d&rsquo;ors, and church chalices (Jerry
says chasubles, but I think not). Greg
and Jerry had dragged all these things up
from the edge of the water in big empty
armfuls, and we stamped the sand down
over them. It really looked exactly as if
the tinfoil moidores were a handful that
was left over. Greg was just giving the
final stamp, when Jerry crooked his hand
over his ear and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hist, men! What was that?&rdquo;
They were having artillery practice
down at the Fort, and just then a terrific
volley went sputtering off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a broadside from the English vessel!&rdquo;
Jerry said. &ldquo;We are pursued!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We crept out from the cave and made
off up the shore as fast as possible. Jerry
went ahead and jumped up on a rock to
reconnoiter. He did look quite piratical,
with my black sailor tie bound tight over
his head and two buttons of his shirt undone.
Greg had his own necktie wrapped
around his head, but several locks of hair
had escaped from under it. He always
manages to have something not quite right
about his costumes. He has very nice
hair&mdash;curly, and quite amberish colored&mdash;but
it&rsquo;s not at all like a pirate&rsquo;s. I poked
him from behind to make him hurry, for
Jerry was pointing at a big schooner that
was coming down the harbor. We all lay
down flat behind the rock until she had
gone slowly around the point. We could
see the sun winking on something that
might have been a cannon in her waist&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the place where cannon always are&mdash;and
of course the captain must have
been keeping a sharp lookout landward
with his spy-glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, mon,&rdquo; said Jerry, when the schooner
had passed, &ldquo;but yon was a verra close
thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s one of the worst things about
Jerry,&mdash;the way he mixes up language.
We&rsquo;d been reading &ldquo;Kidnapped,&rdquo; and I
suppose he forgot he wasn&rsquo;t <i>Alan</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence, dog!&rdquo; I said, to remind him
of who we were. &ldquo;Very like she&rsquo;s but
hove to in the offing, and for aught you
know she&rsquo;s maybe sending ashore the
jolly-boat by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go to the end of the point
and have a look,&rdquo; Greg suggested.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t often make speeches, because
Jerry is apt to pounce on him and
tell him he&rsquo;s &ldquo;too plain American,&rdquo; but I
think it isn&rsquo;t fair, because he hasn&rsquo;t read
as many books as Jerry and I. So I hurried
up and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravely spoke, my lad; so we will, my
hearty!&rdquo; And we crawled and clambered
along till we came to the end of the point
where it&rsquo;s all stones and seaweed and big
surf sometimes. The surf was not very
high this time,&mdash;just waves that went
<i>whoosh</i> and then pulled the pebbles back
with a nice scrawpy sound. The schooner
was half-way down to the Headland, not
paying any attention to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;safe once more
from an ignominious death. But, Chris,
look at the Sea Monster! What&rsquo;s happened
to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sea Monster is a bare black rock-island
off the end of Wecanicut. We
called it that because it looks like one, and
it hasn&rsquo;t any other name that we know of.
We&rsquo;d always wanted awfully to go out
there and explore it, but the only time we
ever asked old Captain Moss, who has
boats for hire, he said, &ldquo;Thunderin&rsquo; bad
landin&rsquo;. Nothin&rsquo; to see there but a clutter
o&rsquo; gulls&rsquo; nests,&rdquo; and went on painting the
<i>Jolly Nancy</i>, which is his nicest boat.</p>

<p>But the thing that Jerry was pointing
out now was very queer indeed. It was
just a little too far away to see clearly
what had happened, but it seemed as if a
piece of rock had fallen away on the side
toward us, leaving a jaggedy opening as
black as a hat and high enough for a person
to stand upright in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The entrance to a subaground tunnel!&rdquo;
Greg shouted, leaping up and down in the
edge of a wave.</p>

<p>He <i>will</i> say &ldquo;subaground,&rdquo; and it really
is quite as sensible as some words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The entrance to a real pirate cave, you
mean!&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;Glory, Chris, I really
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it were. Captain
Kidd was up and down the coast here.
What if they buried stuff in there and
then propped a big chunk of rock up
against the hole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we had a telescope,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t suppose we could see into
the blackness with it. Mercy, I wish we
<i>could</i> get out there! It&rsquo;s more worth exploring
than ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s tell Mother and Aunt!&rdquo; said
Greg, and started running back down the
beach, shouting something all the way.</p>

<p>Mother said, &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Of
course it&rsquo;s a natural cave in the rock.
You probably only noticed it today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she and Aunt Ailsa shut up the
H.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Wells book and came to look. They
did think, when they saw it, that it was
something new. Aunt Ailsa thought it
looked very exciting and mysterious, but
she agreed with Mother that it was no sort
of place to go to in a boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just look at the white foam flinging
around those rocks,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and
there&rsquo;s practically no surf on today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had to admit that it wasn&rsquo;t a nice-looking
place to land on from a rowboat,
but we did wish that we were hardy adventuring
men, bold of heart and undeterred
by grown-ups. We knew, too, that
Captain Moss would say, &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; if we
told him there might be treasure on the
Sea Monster, and he certainly wouldn&rsquo;t
risk the <i>Jolly Nancy</i> on those rocks in her
nice new green paint.</p>

<p>We were so much excited about the
Sea Monster suddenly having a big
black hole in it that we almost forgot to
take the bottle when we went home. We
did forget Aunt Ailsa&rsquo;s hatpin, and Greg
had to run back for it, because he can run
faster than any of the rest of us, and
Captain Lewis held the ferry for him.
Everybody leaned out from the rail and
peered up the landing, because they
thought it must be a fire or the President
or something. They all looked awfully
disappointed when it was only Greg, with
the black necktie still around his head and
Aunt&rsquo;s hatpin held very far away from
him so that it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him if he fell
down. He tumbled on board just as the
nice brown Portuguese man who works
the rattley chain thing at the landings was
pushing the collapsible gate shut, and
Greg gasped:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought&mdash;the moidores&mdash;too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jerry collared him and pulled the
necktie off his head. Jerry hates to have
his relatives look silly in public, but I
thought Greg looked very nice.</p>

<p>We chucked the bottle overboard from
the upper deck, just when the <i>Wecanicut</i>
was halfway over. The nice Portuguese
man shouted up, &ldquo;Hey! You drop something?&rdquo;
but we told him it was just an
old bottle we didn&rsquo;t want, and not to
mind. We watched it go bob-bobbing
along beside an old barrel-head that was
floating by, and we wondered how far it
would go, and if it would leak and sink.
The tide was exactly right to carry it outside,
if all went well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Greg, when we were
halfway up Luke Street, going home, and
had almost forgotten the bottle, &ldquo;perhaps
it will land on the Sea Monster, and the
pirates will find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glory!&rdquo; said Jerry, &ldquo;perhaps it will.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<div class="text">
<p class="first">Just in the middle of the rainiest week came the
thing that made Aunt Ailsa so sad. She read it in the newspaper, in
the casualty list. It was the last summer of the war, and there were
great long casualty lists every day. This said that
Somebody-or-other Westland was &ldquo;wounded and missing.&rdquo; We
didn&rsquo;t know why it made her so sad, because we&rsquo;d never
heard of such a person, but of course it was up to us to cheer her
up as much as possible. Picnics being out of the question, it had to
be indoor cheering, which is harder. Greg succeeded better than the
rest of us, I think. He is still little enough to sit on
people&rsquo;s laps (though his legs spill over, quantities). He sat
on Aunt Ailsa&rsquo;s lap and told her long stories which she seemed
to like much better than the H.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Wells books. He also
dragged her off to join in attic games, and she liked those, too,
and laughed sometimes quite like herself.</p>

<p>Attic games aren&rsquo;t so bad, though summer&rsquo;s not the
proper time for them, really. There is a long cornery sort of closet
full of carpets that runs back under the eaves in our attic, and if
you strew handfuls of beads and tin washers among the carpets and
then dig for them in the dark with a hockey-stick and a pocket
flash-light, it&rsquo;s not poor fun. Unfortunately, my head knocks
against the highest part of the roof now, yet I still do think
it&rsquo;s fun. But Aunt Ailsa is twenty-six and she likes it, so I
suppose I needn&rsquo;t give up.</p>

<p>The day Aunt Ailsa really laughed was when Greg rigged himself up
as an Excavator. That is, he said he was an excavator, but I never
saw anything before that looked at all like him. He had the round
Indian basket from Mother&rsquo;s work-table on his head, and some
automobile goggles, and yards and yards of green braid wound over
his jumper, and Mother&rsquo;s carriage-boots, which came just below
the tops of his socks. In his hand he had what I think was a
rake-handle&mdash;it was much taller than he&mdash;and he had the
queerest, glassy, goggling expression under the basket.</p>

<a name="fig1"></a>
<div class="figure"><img src="images/image1.png" alt="Greg rigged
himself up as an excavator" /></div>


<p>He never will learn to fix proper clothes. He might have seen
what he should have done by looking at Jerry, who had an old felt
hat with a bit of candle-end (not lit) stuck in the ribbon, and a
bandana tied askew around his neck. But Aunt Ailsa laughed and
laughed, which was what we wanted her to do, so neither of us
remonstrated with Greg that time.</p>

<p>Father plays the &rsquo;cello,&mdash;that is, he does when he has
time,&mdash;and he found time to play it with Aunt, who does piano.
I think she really liked that better than the attic games, and we
did, too, in a way. The living-room of our house is quite
low-ceilinged, and part of it is under the roof, so that you can
hear the rain on it. The boys lay on the floor, and Mother and I sat
on the couch, and we listened to the rain on the roof and the
sound&mdash;something like rain&mdash;of the piano, and
Father&rsquo;s &rsquo;cello booming along with it. They played a
thing called &ldquo;Air Religieux&rdquo; that I think none of us
will ever hear again without thinking of the humming on the roof and
the candles all around the room and one big one on the piano beside
Aunt Ailsa, making her hair all shiny. Her hair is amberish, too,
like Greg&rsquo;s, but her eyes are a very golden kind of brown,
while his are dark blue.</p>

<p>We thought she&rsquo;d forgotten about being sad, but one night
when I couldn&rsquo;t sleep because it was so hot I heard her
crying, and Mother talking the way she does to us when something
makes us unhappy. I felt rather frightened, somehow, and wretched,
and I covered up my ears because I didn&rsquo;t think Aunt would
want me to hear them talking there.</p>

<p>The next day the sun really came out and stayed out. All of
<i>us</i> came out, too, and explored the garden. The grass had
grown till it stood up like hay, and there were such tall green
weeds in the flowerbeds that Mother couldn&rsquo;t believe
they&rsquo;d grown during the rain and thought they were some phlox
she&rsquo;d overlooked. The phlox itself was staggering with
flowers, and all the lupin leaves held round water-drops in the
hollows of their five-fingered hands. Greg said that they were fairy
wash-basins. He also found a drowned field-mouse and a sparrow. He
was frightfully sorry about it, and carried them around wrapped up
in a warm flannel till Mother begged him to give them a military
funeral. Jerry soaked all the labels off a cigar-box, and then
burned a most beautiful inscription on the lid with his pyrography
outfit. Part of the inscription was a poem by Greg, which went like
this:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>&ldquo;O little sparrow,</p>
<p>Perhaps to-morrow</p>
<p>You will fly in a blue house.</p>
<p>And perhaps you will run</p>
<p>In the sun,</p>
<p>Little field-mouse.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Jerry didn&rsquo;t see what Greg meant by a &ldquo;blue
house,&rdquo; but I did, and I think it was rather nice. I copied
the poem secretly, before the cigar-box was buried at the end of the
rose-bed. I think Greg really cried, but he had so much black
mosquito netting hanging over the brim of his best hat that I
couldn&rsquo;t be sure.</p>

<p>Fourth of July came and went&mdash;the very patriotic one, when
everybody saved their fireworks-money to buy W.S.S. with. We bought
W.S.S. and made very grand fireworks out of joss-sticks. Joss-sticks
have wonderful possibilities that most people don&rsquo;t know
about. The three of us went down to the foot of the garden after
dark and did an exhibition for the others. By whisking the
joss-sticks around by their floppy handles you can make all sorts of
fiery circles. I made two little ones for eyes, and Greg did a nose
in the middle, and Jerry twirled a curvy one underneath for a mouth
that could be either smiling or ferocious. A little way off you
can&rsquo;t see the people who do it at all, and it looks just like
a great fiery face with a changing, wobbly expression.</p>

<p>Then Greg did a fire dance with two sparklers. He dances rather
well,&mdash;not real one-steps and waltzes, but weird things he
makes up himself. This one lasted as long as the sparklers burned,
and it was quite gorgeous. After that we had a candle-light
procession around the garden, and the grown people said that the
candles looked very mysterious bobbing in and out between the trees.
We felt more like high priests than patriots, but it was very
festive and wonderful, and when we ended by having cakes and
lime-juice on the porch at half-past nine, everybody agreed that it
had been a real celebration and quite different.</p>

<p>In spite of being up so late the night before, Greg was the first
one down to breakfast next morning. Our postman always brings the
mail just before the end of breakfast, and we can hear him click the
gate as he comes in. This morning Jerry and Greg dashed for the mail
together, and Greg squeezed through where Jerry thought he
couldn&rsquo;t and got there first. When they came back, Jerry was
saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me have it, won&rsquo;t you; it&rsquo;ll take you all
day!&rdquo; and dodging his arm over Greg&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Messrs. Christopher, Gerald, and Gregory Holford; 17 Luke
Street,&rdquo; Greg read slowly. Then he tripped over the threshold
and floundered on to me, flourishing the big envelope and
shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny paper, and it&rsquo;s funny writing, and
I <i>know</i> it&rsquo;s from The Bottle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My stars!&rdquo; said Jerry, with a final snatch.</p>

<p>But I had the envelope, and I looked at it very carefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I truly believe that it
is.&rdquo;</p> <br /> </div>

<hr class="short"/>

<br />
<br />


<h3>CHAPTER III</h3> <div class="text">

<p class="first">The envelope was a square, thinnish one, addressed
in very small, black handwriting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <i>must</i> be from The Bottle,&rdquo; Jerry said;
&ldquo;otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t have thought you were a boy and
put Christopher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had been thinking just the same thing while I was trying to
open the envelope. It was one of the very tightly stuck kind that
scrumples up when you try to rip it with your finger, and we had to
slit it with a fruit-knife before we could get at the letter. There
were sheets of thin paper all covered with writing, and when Jerry
and Greg saw that, they both fell upon it so that none of us could
read it at all. I persuaded them that the quickest thing to do would
be to let me read it aloud, and as we&rsquo;d finished breakfast
anyway, we each took our last piece of toast in our hands and went
out and sat on the bottom step of the porch. I read:</p> </div>
<blockquote> <p><i>Fellow Adventurers and Mariners in
Distress</i>:</p>

<p>By this time there may be naught left of you but a whitening
huddle of bones, surf bleached on the end of Wecanicut,&mdash;for I
know well what meager fare are eiligugs&rsquo; eggs and barnacles.
However, I take the chance of finding at least one of you alive, and
address you fraternally as a companion in distress.</p>

<p>I am myself stranded on a cheerless island where, against my
will, I am kept captive&mdash;for how long a time I cannot guess. I
was brought here at night, only forty-eight hours ago, and landed
from a vessel which almost immediately departed whence it had come,
into the darkness. My captors left me to go with the vessel, the
chief of them threatening to return every week to torment me unless
I obeyed his slightest command. I stand in great fear of this man,
who is tall and bearded, for he brings with him instruments of
torture and bottles containing, without doubt, poison.</p>

<p>Can you imagine my joy when, tottering down the beach this
morning, supporting my frame upon two sticks, I beheld your bottle
cast up on the sands? Now, thought I, I can unburden myself to these
three unfortunate men, obviously in even greater distress than my
own, and we can, perhaps, ease each other&rsquo;s monotonous
maroonity. Scholars, too, I perceive you to be,&mdash;witness the
Latin following your signatures. Ah well, <i>Grata superveniet quae
non sperabitur hora,</i> as the poet so truly says, and I cannot
express to you how eager, how happy I am, in the thought of
communicating with some one other than the natives of this desolate
isle. These inhabitants, though friendly on the whole, are uncouth
and barbaric. They spend their entire time fishing from boats which
they build themselves, or squatting beside their huts mending their
fishing implements.</p>

<p>The good soul with whom I am lodging is calling me to my scanty
repast. In the rude language of the place she tells me that there is
&ldquo;Krabss al ad an dunny.&rdquo; How can I live long, I ask, on
such fare?</p>

<p align="right"> Hopefully, your&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p align="right"> CASTAWAY COMRADE. </p> <p>P.S. My
address&mdash;mail reaches me from time to time, by aforesaid
vessel&mdash;is P.O. Box 14, Blue Harbor, Me. ME stands for Mid
Equator, but the abbreviation is sufficient. Blue Harbor is my own
literal translation of the native Bluar Boor. Box 14 refers to the
native system of delivering messages. P.O. has, I think, something
to do with the P. &amp; O. steamers, which, however, do not very
often touch here. </p> </blockquote> <div class="text">

<p>&ldquo;I <i>told</i> you it would go around the world!&rdquo;
Greg said, when I had finished, and Jerry and I were staring at each
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Well!&rdquo;</i> Jerry said at last. &ldquo;<i>What</i>
luck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should rather say so,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;suppose a
fisherman had found it, or no one at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless his old heart,&rdquo; said Jerry, taking the
letter.</p>

<p>I wanted to know why &ldquo;old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be ancient if he has to totter along on two
sticks,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;Besides, he has a stately,
professorish sort of style. Do you suppose he really does want us to
write to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he does,&rdquo; Greg said; &ldquo;he tells us to
often enough. Think of being alone out there with savages, and that
bearded chief coming with poison bottles and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Greg,&rdquo; said Jerry; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
understand. There&rsquo;s more in this than meets the eye, Chris. I
didn&rsquo;t get on to this crab salad business when you read
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither had I; in fact, I hadn&rsquo;t got on to it until Jerry
said it in proper English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good sort, poor old dear,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Why do you suppose they keep him out there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s there of his own free will, right
enough,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>We were still confabbing over the letter, and explaining bits to
Greg, who was hopelessly mystified, when Mother came out to
transplant some columbine that had wandered into the lawn. We did a
quick secret consultation and then decided to let her in on the
Castaway. So we bolted after her and took away the trowel and showed
her the letter. She read it through twice, and then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ailsa must hear this, and Father!&rdquo; But what we
wanted to know was whether or not we might write to the Castaway,
because we didn&rsquo;t quite want to without letting her know about
it. She laughed some more and said, &ldquo;yes, we might,&rdquo; and
that he was &ldquo;a dear,&rdquo; which was what we thought.</p>

<p>We decided that we would write immediately, so Jerry dashed off
to Father&rsquo;s study and got two sheets of nice thin paper with
&ldquo;17 Luke Street&rdquo; at the top in humpy green letters, and
I borrowed Aunt Ailsa&rsquo;s fountain-pen, which turned out to be
empty. I might have known it, for they always are empty when you
need them most. Jerry, like a goose, filled it over the clean paper
we were going to use for the letter, and it slobbered blue ink all
over the top sheet. But the under one wasn&rsquo;t hurt, and we
thought one page full would be all we could write, anyway. We took
the things out to the porch table, and Greg held down the corner of
the paper so it wouldn&rsquo;t flap while I wrote. Jerry sat on the
arm of my chair and thought so excitedly that it jiggled me.</p>

<p>But minutes went on, and the fountain pen began to ooze from
being too full, and none of us could think of a single thing to
say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we just write to him ourselves,&mdash;in our own form,
I mean,&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be stupid. And I
don&rsquo;t feel maroonish here on the porch. We&rsquo;ll have to
wait till we go to Wecanicut again, and write from there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt somehow the way Jerry did, so we put away the things again
and went out under the hemlock tree to talk about the Castaway. Greg
didn&rsquo;t come, and we supposed he&rsquo;d gone to feed a tame
toad he had that year, or something. The toad lived under the
syringa bush beside the gate, and Greg insisted that it came out
when he whistled for it, but it never would perform when we went on
purpose to watch it, so I don&rsquo;t know whether it did or
not.</p>

<p>Under the hemlock is one of the best places in the garden for
councils and such. The branches quite touch the grass, and when you
creep under them you are in a dark, golden sort of tent, crackley
and sweet-smelling. You can slither pine-needles through your
fingers as you discuss, too, and it helps you to think. We thought
for quite a long time, and then I got out the letter and spread it
down in one of the wavy patches of sunlight, and we read it
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you really think anybody&rsquo;d find it?&rdquo; Jerry
asked suddenly, and I told him I hadn&rsquo;t thought so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither did I,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let alone such a
jolly old soul. Why, he&rsquo;d be better than Aunt on a
picnic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wonder why he has to stay there,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s a fugitive from justice,&rdquo; Jerry
suggested; &ldquo;or perhaps he&rsquo;s a prisoner and the bearded
person comes out with Spanish Inquisition things to make him confess
his horrible crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <i>sounds</i> like a person who&rsquo;d done a horrible
crime, doesn&rsquo;t he!&rdquo; I said in scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Jerry, who really has the most
inspired ideas for plots, &ldquo;perhaps he&rsquo;s an innocent old
man whose wicked nephews want to frighten him into changing his
will, leaving an enormous fortune to them. And they&rsquo;re keeping
him on the island till he&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever it is,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think he&rsquo;s awfully happy somehow, and it&rsquo;s nice of him
to write such a gorgeous thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we both decided that whether he was staying on the island of
his own free will, or in bondage, in any case it must be frightfully
dull for him and that our letter ought to be interesting and
cheerful.</p>

<p>Just then the hemlock branches thrashed apart and Greg crawled
under with pine-needles in his hair. He sat back on his heels and
blinked at us, because he&rsquo;d just come out of the sunlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought <i>some</i>body ought to write to the Bottle
Man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>

<p>Greg fished up a bent piece of paper from inside his jumper and
handed it to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can see it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but not
Jerry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if I&rsquo;d want to!&rdquo; Jerry said; but he did,
fearfully.</p>

<p>Greg is the most unexpected person I ever knew. He&rsquo;s always
doing things like that, when everyone else has given up.</p>

<p>I spread his paper out on top of the other letter, and he
sprawled down beside me, all ready to explain with his finger. What
with his dreadfully bad writing and the sunlight moving off the
paper all the time as the branches swayed, it took me ever so long
to read the thing. This is what it was:</p> </div>

<blockquote> <p><i>Dear Bottle Man</i>:</p>

<p>To-day we got your leter wich surprised us very much. Although I
kept hopeing and hopeing some body would find the bottle. We are not
so distresed now because we were picked up and now have toast and
other things beter than barnicles. I mesured from here to the
equater on the big map and it is an aufuly far way for the bottle to
go. Only I thought it would. I am sorry you are so imprisined on the
iland and please dont let the cheif with the beard poisen you
because we would like to hear from you agan. If there is tresure on
that iland I should think you could look for it and it would be
exiting. But prehaps there is none. We hope there is some on
Wecanicut. But it is hard to know sirtainly. Chris and Jerry are
going to do a leter. But I thought I would first. I hope the saviges
will be frendly allways.</p>

<p>Your respecfull comrade,</p>

<p align="right">GREGORY HOLFORD.</p>


<p>P.S. None of us are Bones yet.</p> </blockquote>

<div class="text">
<p>&ldquo;Will it do?&rdquo; Greg asked anxiously, when I folded it
up. His eyes grow very dark when he&rsquo;s anxious, and they were
perfectly inky now. You never would have guessed that they were
really blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do splendidly,&rdquo; I said, for I did think
the Castaway man would like Greg&rsquo;s letter tremendously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better let me see it, my lad,&rdquo; said Jerry, rolling
over among the pine-cones and sitting up.</p>

<p>Greg got his precious letter with a snatch and a squeak, and
scurried off with it. I pitched Jerry back on to the pine-needles,
because I knew he&rsquo;d never let the thing go if he saw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>let</i> him send it,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly all right, and it will do the Bottle Man
heaps of good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jerry growled about &ldquo;beastly scrawls&rdquo; and
wasn&rsquo;t pleased with me until supper-time.</p>

<p>Somehow we all began calling our island person the &ldquo;Bottle
Man&rdquo; after Greg did, for it seemed as good a name as any for
him, seeing that we didn&rsquo;t know his real one. We read the
letter from him after supper to Aunt Ailsa, and she laughed and
liked it, and so did Father. We also asked Father what the Latin
meant, and he made a funny face and said he&rsquo;d forgotten such
things, but then he looked at it again and told us it meant
something like this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The happy hour shall come, all the more appreciated
because it comes unexpectedly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we went to bed thinking about our poor old Bottle Man
consoling himself out there on his island with Latin quotations.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<div class="text">
<p class="first">We all went to Wecanicut next day, which was a glorious one, and
when the food had disappeared we three walked up the point and wrote
to the Bottle Man from there. We&rsquo;d decided that the paper with
&ldquo;17 Luke Street&rdquo; on it was much too grand for
&ldquo;poore mariners&rdquo; anyway, so we&rsquo;d just brought
brownish paper that comes in a block. We told the Bottle Man how
wonderful we thought it was that he had found our message, and how
his letter had cheered our lonely watching for a sail. Also, how we
had been picked up and were returned now to Wecanicut of our own
will, seeking rich treasure. We described the &ldquo;Sea
Monster&rdquo; very carefully, and wrote about the black
cave-entrance-looking place that had happened, where no boat would
dare to venture. Jerry&rsquo;s description of it was quite wild. He
dictated it to me above the shrieking of a lot of gulls which were
flying over us all the time. It went like this:</p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;The Sea Monster was quite terrific enough looking before,
like the slimy black head of something huge coming out of the water.
Now it looks as if it had opened a cavernous maw&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m
sure he nabbed that from some book) &ldquo;as black as ink, ready to
swallow any unfortunate mariner which came near. Below the base of
this fearsome hole roars the cruel surf, ready to engulf a boat
which would never be seen more if it was once caught in this deadly
eddy.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>I thought &ldquo;deadly eddy&rdquo; sounded like Illiteration, or
something you shouldn&rsquo;t do, in the Rhetoric Books, but Jerry
was much excited over his description. He sat on top of a rock,
pointing out at the Sea Monster like a prophet. He has quite black
hair which blows around wildly, and he looked very strange sitting
up there raving about the cavern. The letter was very long by the
time we&rsquo;d put in everything, and we hoped the Bottle Man would
like it. Just before we signed it, I said:</p>

<a name="fig2"></a>
<div class="figure"><img src="images/image2.png" alt="We hoped the
Bottle Man would like the letter" /></div>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;d better tell him I&rsquo;m really
Christine and not Christopher?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>,&rdquo; Jerry said; &ldquo;put Chris, the way
you did before. He&rsquo;s writing now as man to man. He might be
disgusted if he knew it was just a mere female.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>thank</i> you,&rdquo; I said; but I did put
&ldquo;Chris,&rdquo; on account of our all being fellow
castaways.</p>

<p>When we&rsquo;d finished the letter we walked a long way down the
other shore toward the Fort. The wind was blowing right, and we
could hear bits of what the band was playing and now and then
peppery sounds from the rifle practice. It&rsquo;s not a very big
fort, but it squats on the other side of Wecanicut, watching the
bay, and real cannon stick out at loopholes in the wall. The ferry
really only goes to Wecanicut on account of the Fort, because
there&rsquo;s nothing else there but a few farm houses and some ugly
summer cottages near the ferry-slip. The point from which you see
the Monster is not near the Fort or the houses at all, and is much
the wildest part of Wecanicut. When you&rsquo;re standing on the
very end you might think you really were on a deserted island,
because you can look straight out to sea.</p>

<p>We cut back cross-country through the bay-bushes and the dry,
tickly grass to our usual part of Wecanicut, where the grown-ups
were just beginning to collect the baskets and things and to look at
their watches. We posted the letter on the way home, and Greg
jiggled the flap of the letter-box twice to make sure that it
wasn&rsquo;t stuck.</p>

<p>It was that week that Jerry sprained his ankle jumping off the
porch-roof and had to sit in the big wicker chair with his foot on a
pillow for days. He hated it, but he didn&rsquo;t make any fuss at
all, which was decent of him considering that the weather was the
best we&rsquo;d had all summer. We played chess, which he likes
because he can always beat me, and also &ldquo;Pounce,&rdquo; which
pulls your eyes out after a little while and burns holes in your
brain. It&rsquo;s that frightful card game where you try to get rid
of thirteen cards before any one else, and snatch at aces in the
middle, on top of everybody. Jerry is horribly clever at it and
shouts &ldquo;Pounce!&rdquo; first almost every time. Greg always
has at least twelve of his thirteen cards left and explains to you
very carefully how he had it all planned very far ahead and would
have won if Jerry hadn&rsquo;t said &ldquo;Pounce&rdquo; so
soon.</p>

<p>Also, Father let Jerry play the &rsquo;cello, and he made
heavenly hideous sounds which he said were exactly like what the Sea
Monster&rsquo;s voice would be if it had one. Just when we were all
rather despairing, because Dr. Topham said that Jerry mustn&rsquo;t
walk for two days more, the very thing happened which we&rsquo;d
been hoping for. Greg came up all the porch steps at once with one
bounce, brandishing a square envelope and shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bottle Man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was addressed to all of us, but I turned it over to Jerry to
do the honors with, on account of his being a poor invalid and
Abused by Fate. He had the envelope open in two shakes, with the
complicated knife he always carries, and pulled out any amount of
paper. He stared at the top page for a minute, and then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Greg, this is for you. You can be pawing over it
while we&rsquo;re reading the proper one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I said, &ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
hear it all, one at a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I took Greg&rsquo;s and read it aloud, because he takes such
an everlasting time over handwriting and this writing was rather
queer and hard to read. This is his letter:</p> </div>

<blockquote> <p><i>Respected Comrade Gregory Holford:</i></p>

<p>I am writing to you separately because you wrote to me
separately, and very much I liked your letter. I cannot tell you how
much relieved I am to hear that toast has been substituted for
barnacles in your diet. In the long run, toast is far better for a
mariner, however hardy he may be.</p>

<p>It is indeed a long way from Wecanicut to the Equator,&mdash;but
are you sure you measured to ME.&mdash;<i>Mid</i> Equator? It is
very different, you know. The bearded one is pleased with me and has
not brought his poison bottles of late, but thank you for not
wanting me to die just now. I do not know of any treasure in Bluar
Boor, but I refer you to the enclosed letter which tells something
of treasure elsewhere. I hope your search on Wecanicut, my dear sir,
will be richly rewarded.</p>

<p>Please note that I refer to <i>natives</i>, not <i>savages</i>.
There is a vasty difference; more than you perhaps might
suppose.</p>

<p>May I inscribe myself your most humble servant,</p>

<p align="right">THE BOTTLE MAN.</p>

<p>P.S. I&rsquo;m so glad your Bones are still where they
belong.</p> </blockquote>

<div class="text"> <p>Greg was counting elaborately on his fingers,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe he answered <i>everything</i> in my letter, but
please let me have it, because there are some things I need to work
out myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the business,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;This must
be the whole sad story of his life,&mdash;there&rsquo;s pages of it.
Coil yourself up comfortably, Chris, and I&rsquo;ll fire
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I coiled up beside Greg on the Gloucester hammock, and Jerry
began to read.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<div class="text">


<blockquote> <p class="first">From my desolate island refuge I salute the Intrepid
Trio! Good sirs, what you tell me of the &ldquo;Sea Monster&rdquo;
makes my flesh creep and my hair stir with terror. A murderous bad
place I should call it, and not one to trifle with. Yet it might
well be, as you think, that the sudden-appearing cavern is the mouth
of a pirate cave fairly bursting with treasure, and only now exposed
to the eyes of such daring adventurers as yourselves by a trick of
the elements. Strange things there be above and below the waters of
the world&mdash;which serves to remind me of a tale you might not
scorn to hear. You may take it or leave it, as you will, but at
least the penning of it will pass some of my hours of banishment in
a pleasant fashion.</p>

<p>In the year of grace 18&mdash; (I shudder to think how long ago)
I was a bold youth of perhaps the age of the valiant
Christopher.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Here Jerry paused to give a muffled hoot at me. I chucked a
hammock cushion at him, and he went on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My father&rsquo;s house stood on a rambling street in an old
waterside town, and from the windows of my room I could see the
topmasts of sailing ships thrusting upward above gray roofs. Small
marvel that my head should be filled with the ways of the sea and
the wonder of it, or that I should spend long hours dreaming over
books that told of adventures thereon. It was over such a book that
I was poring one summer&rsquo;s evening as I sat in the library
bow-window. The breeze from the harbor came in and stirred the
curtains beside my head, and brought with it the last westering
ripple of sunlight and a smell of climbing roses. The book had
dropped from my hand and I was well-nigh drowsing, when I saw, as
plain as day, the queerest figure possible clicking open our garden
gate. He looked to be some sort of South American
half-breed,&mdash;swart face under rough black hair, and striped
blanket gathered over dirty white trousers. Now I had seen many a
strange man disembark from ships, but, never such a one as this, and
when I saw that he was coming straight toward my window, I was half
tempted to make an escape.</p>

<p>He leaned on the sill of the open casement with his dark face
just below mine and began to pour out, in halting English, a tale
which at first I had some trouble in understanding. The most that I
made of it was that he, and he alone, knew the whereabouts of a city
buried ages since under the sea and filled with treasure of an
unbelievable description. But you may imagine that even the hint of
such a thing was enough to set me all athrill, and I was not greatly
surprised at myself when I found that I was following the queer,
slinking figure down our bare little New England street.</p>

<p>He led me to a ship, an old brigantine heavy with age and
barnacles and hung about with the sorriest gray rags of canvas that
ever did duty for sails. No wonder that nine days out we lost our
fore tops&rsquo;l. But stay; I fear I go too fast! For you must know
that I went aboard that brigantine, and once aboard I could not go
ashore again, partly because the strange, ill-assorted crew detained
me at every turn, and partly because the longing was so strong upon
me to see the things I had read of so often. And that night found me
still upon the vessel, nosing down to the harbor light, with the
lamps of my father&rsquo;s house winking less and less brightly on
the dim shore astern.</p>

<p>Well, sirs, it would weary you to tell much of that voyage, and
besides, many&rsquo;s the time you yourselves must have weathered
the Horn. For it was &rsquo;round Cape Stiff we went&mdash;no Panama
Canal in those days&mdash;and I served a bitter apprenticeship on
ice-coated yards, clutching numbly at battering sails frozen stiff
as iron. It was Peru we were bound for,&mdash;Peru where the
submarine city lay beneath uncounted fathoms waiting for us. The
captain and I were the only ones Acuma, the half-breed, had taken
into his confidence; all the others sailed on a blind errand,
trusting to the skipper, who was a shrewd man and severe. And the
brigantine wallowed around the Cape and toiled on and on up the
coast, and every day Acuma grew more restless; every day he cast
about the water with eyes that seemed to pierce to the very bottom
of the Pacific.</p>

<p>One day of blue sky and little breeze, when we were pushing the
brigantine with all sails set, Acuma flung himself at a bound to the
quarterdeck, and a moment later the skipper shouted quick orders
that the crew could not understand for the life of them. For to
heave the ship to, just when we all had been whistling for enough
breeze to give her something more than steerage way, seemed nothing
short of insane. Acuma climbed to the maintop and looked at the
coast of Peru with a telescope, and the captain took bearings with
his instruments.</p>

<p>It was Acuma and I who went over the side in diving suits, for no
others save the captain knew what we sought, as I have said. Down I
went and down, with the weight of water crushing ever more strongly
against me, till I stood upon the sea&rsquo;s floor. That in itself
was quite wonderful enough&mdash;the green whiteness of the sand and
the strange, multi-colored forest of weed and coral through which my
searchlight bored a single, luminous pathway. But right ahead,
looming and wavering, seen for an instant, lost again when a deep
vibration stirred and swayed the water, shone the faintly golden
shape of a great portal. Acuma I had lost sight of, but I had no
need to ask him what lay before me. The wild pounding of my heart
told me that I stood at the gateway of the city that had been
covered a thousand thousand years ago by the unheeding sea. Leaning
at an angle against the tide, I struggled forward till the great
gate towered above me, its arch half lost in the green, swimming
shadow of the water. But as I flashed my light up across its
pillars, it answered with the shifting sparkle of gems crusted thick
upon it.</p>

<p>I walked then, breathless, into a street paved with rough silver
ingots, each one surely weighing a quintal, between tremulous shapes
of buildings which pointed lustrous towers upward through fathoms of
green water. It was many minutes before I dared enter one of those
great silent halls. Dragging my heavy leaden-soled boots, I pushed
through a shapely silver doorway, and a fish darted past me as I
entered. Who could imagine the wonder of that vast room! The mosaic
that covered the walls and ceilings was of gold and jewels, not
porphyry and serpentine, such as delight the wondering visitor to
Venice, but precious stones&mdash;rubies, sapphires, emeralds,
amethysts as richly purple as grape clusters, topaz as clear and
mellow as honey.</p>

<p>Behind a traceried grillwork lay heaped a mound of treasures such
as no human eye will ever see again. I lifted a little tree
fashioned all of gold,&mdash;each leaf wrought of the
metal&mdash;and strung with jewelled fruits on which ruby-eyed
golden birds fed. In despairing rapture I clutched after a neck
ornament hung with pendulous pearls as large as plums. But as I
reached for it, I felt that something was looking at me from the
corner. Not Acuma; no human being was in sight. Peering out through
the glass visor of my helmet, I saw fixed on me from low down beside
the doorway two inky, moveless eyes as large as saucers. They were
not human eyes, nor did they belong to any sea creature I had ever
beheld or read of. They were round and fixed, pools of bottomless
blackness, staring at me through two varas of clear, swaying water.
I took an uncertain step backwards, and as I did so I felt something
soft and heavy laid slowly and slimily upon my shoulder....</p>

<p>Ah me, here is an interruption! A native child approaches,
bearing as an offering a Lol Ipop (one of the native fruits). Just
before he reaches me he falls face down, doubtless out of respect
for my gray hairs, and, on arising, proffers me the Lol Ipop, now
coated with sand. In this state I am expected to eat it, and, being
in great awe and fear of the inhabitants, I proceed to do so, which
incapacitates me for further epistolatory effort.</p>

<p>So, till I recover from the effects of my enforced meal, believe
me your devoted correspondent,</p>

<p align="right">THE BOTTLE MAN.</p>

<div class = "text">
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all mean tricks!&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than a continued story,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Bother the horrid native child! Do you suppose that&rsquo;s
really why he stopped?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably not; he knew it was the excitingest place to
stop. What did I tell you about his being ancient? Now he
<i>says</i> he has gray hairs, so that proves it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think he might,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;after such
experiences. What do you think it could have been that stared at
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An octopus, most likely,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;They
have goggly black eyes; I&rsquo;ve read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he said he&rsquo;d never seen such eyes on any sea
beast he knew of, and he&rsquo;s read as much as you have;
that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That treasure! Oh, my eye!&rdquo; Jerry sighed. &ldquo;Do
you suppose he brought home hunks of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same hunks that we dig up on Wecanicut, I
suppose,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you think he&rsquo;s making up the whole
yarn?&rdquo; Jerry asked. &ldquo;Well, even if he is, it&rsquo;s a
mighty good one, and it might have happened to him, at
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Greg looked up suddenly from beside me, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> think the thing what stared at him was a
mer-person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said Jerry, &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re
right.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<div class="text">
<p class="first"> Next day Jerry was well enough to walk around with
a cane, and when he&rsquo;d broken Father&rsquo;s second-best
malacca stick by vaulting over the box border with it, we decided
that he was quite all right, and the summer went on again as usual.
Of course we wrote to the Bottle Man at once, and told him, as
respectfully as we could, just what we thought of him for letting
the native child interrupt him in such an exciting part. We also
begged him to write again as soon as possible, and to choose a place
where the inhabitants weren&rsquo;t likely to come with offerings.
We kept waiting and waiting, and no letter came, so we settled
ourselves to Grim Resignation, as Jerry said. It was worse than
waiting for the next number of a serial story, because you&rsquo;re
pretty certain when that will come, but we had no idea how long it
would be before the Bottle Man wrote to us.</p>

<p>Aunt Ailsa still needed cheering up a good deal, and that kept us
busy. The cheering was great fun for us, because it consisted mostly
of picnics and long, long walks,&mdash;the kind where you take a
stick and a kit-bag and eat your lunch under a hedge, like a tinker.
We also wrote a story which we used to put in instalments under her
plate at breakfast every other day. We took turns writing the story,
and Greg&rsquo;s instalments always made Aunt Ailsa the most cheered
up of all. The story was much too long to put in here, and rather
ridiculous, besides.</p>

<p>By this time it was almost September, and asters were beginning
to bloom in the garden and the hollyhocks were almost gone.
Wecanicut was turning the dry, russetty color that it does late in
the summer, and the harbor seemed bluer every day. Captain Moss took
us out in the <i>Jolly Nancy</i> one afternoon just for
kindness&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t hire her at all. She is a
sixteen-footer and quite fast, in spite of being rather broad in the
beam. He let each of us steer her and told us a great many names of
things on her, which I forgot immediately. Jerry always remembers
things like that and can talk about reef-cringles and topping-lift
as if he really knew what they were for. We went quite far out and
saw the Sea Monster from a different side in the distance, and
tacked down to the other end of Wecanicut under the Fort guns.</p>

<p>It was when we got in from the gorgeous sail, with Greg carrying
the little basket all made of twisted-up rope Captain Moss had done
for him, that we found a big, square envelope lying on the hall
table. And, to our despair, supper was just ready and we
couldn&rsquo;t read the letter till afterward. Supper was good, I
must admit,&mdash;baked eggs, all crusty and buttery on top, and
muffins, and cherry jam. We ate hugely, because of the <i>Jolly
Nancy</i> making us so hungry.</p>

<p>When we&rsquo;d finished we went into Father&rsquo;s study, where
he wasn&rsquo;t, and turned on the desk-light and got at the letter.
I read it, while the boys crouched about expectantly. Here it
is:</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Dear Comrades</i>:</p>

<p>I should have answered your frantic appeals for news of me long
since, had I not been slavishly occupied in carrying out the demands
of the Man of Torture from whom I am now completely released,
praises be. I am even contemplating escape from Bluar Boor by
stealth. But no doubt you have no desire for these modern details
and are all agog to find out whether or not I met a wretched death
at the bottom of the sea. I think you left me&mdash;or I left
you&mdash;with a soft and hideous something resting upon my
shoulder.</p>

<p>Sirs, it was a Hand, a webbed hand, and turning, I looked
straight down into another pair of flat dark eyes. They belonged to
a creature not as tall as I, and certainly not human in shape. Arms
and legs it had, of a sort, and scales, also, and finny spines, and
a soft slimy body. Then, through the door which led to the silver
street, I saw more of the creatures, and more,&mdash;a soft,
hurrying crowd patting over the ingot blocks which paved the road,
peering in at the door, beckoning with webby fingers.</p>

<p>My helmet smothered the cry I gave as I struggled against the
horrible resistance of the water toward the door. Out in the street
the mer-crowd surrounded me, fingered my arms, looking at me with
unfathomable, disc-like eyes, black as ink. With dawning
comprehension it came over me that these creatures inhabited the
desolate, sea-filled city, lived in the mighty golden halls that
once had echoed to the footsteps of Peruvian kings, fared about the
rich streets where coral now grew instead of tree and flower.</p>

<p>The things were speechless, with no seeming means of
communication, and I saw, too, that they could not leave the
sea-bottom, but walked upon it as we do upon earth, and could no
more rise than we can leap into the air and swim upon it. I tried to
push my difficult way through the clinging swarm, who seemed
friendly enough in a weird, inhuman way, but I could not pass
through. Dimly through the swinging water I could see others coming
from every carven doorway down the silent street. I thought then of
the weights attached to me, and I decided to cut them loose at once
and rise from the ghostly place, of which I had seen quite enough to
suit me. But I determined to take with me at least one thing from
the vast mounds of treasure which held me breathless with utter
bewilderment.</p>

<p>So I turned and with my long knife began prying from its doorway
a ruby as large as my fist. Instantly, without warning, the creature
nearest me raised its scaly hand in a flinging gesture, and I felt a
hot and rushing pain just above my right elbow. I felt, too, a
coldness of water spurting down my arm and clutched wildly at the
sleeve of my diving-suit to seal the little hole which I saw in it.
Holding it tightly with my left hand, I slashed with my right at the
creatures who were now moving upon me menacingly, pressing me close.
If they forced me back into the doorway, all hope would be gone. I
cut desperately at the fastenings that secured the weights; felt
myself rising; felt my legs pull out from the clinging, slimy arms;
looked down at them&mdash;a sea of bobbing smooth heads, of round,
expressionless, black eyes; saw them waving their tentacle-like arms
in fury; saw at last the dim, golden crest of the tallest tower
below my feet; burst above the blessed sea-level and saw good blue
waves slapping the bow of the brigantine drifting lazily down toward
me.</p>

<p>I know nothing of the voyage home. I must have been poisoned by
the missile, whatever it was, that the sea-creature flung at me. (I
bear the scar to this day.) For I have no recollection of much more,
until I sat in the library bow-window of my father&rsquo;s house,
very tired and stiff and thoroughly thankful that the voyage was
over. It was dark, and my mother sat sewing beside a shaded lamp and
singing to herself. I fingered the book that lay beside me, on the
window-seat, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, did you keep the book just here all the time I was
gone because you were sorry I went and wanted to remember
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed, and said: &ldquo;Yes, all the time while you were
sailing to the Port of Stars. Come now to supper, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I got up very stiffly, for I felt weak and dizzy still, and
went with her. I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mother, that after all I couldn&rsquo;t
bring you any of the jewels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon she laughed again and said something about
&ldquo;Cornelia&rdquo; which I am too modest to repeat, but which,
being scholars, you will know by heart, and said that she was glad
enough to have me back at all.</p>

<p>Sirs, you cannot think how beautiful our little dining-room
looked to me, with the old brass-handled highboy in the corner and
the pots of flowers on the sill&mdash;far more beautiful than the
fretted golden towers and gem-girdled walls of the City under the
Sea.</p>

<p>So take my advice, young sirs, the advice of a man many years
older than you bold young blades: don&rsquo;t you ever go listening
to a half-breed Peruvian that comes slinking to your window, no
matter how enticing may be his tales of treasure.</p>


<p align="right">
Your most faithful &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>


<p align="right">BOTTLE MAN.</p>


</blockquote>
<div class="text">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do</i> you think he dreamed it?&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever it was, he must have been glad to get
back,&rdquo; I said, switching off the light so that we could talk
in the dark, which is more creepy and pleasant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the treasure!&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;Do you suppose
there ever was such treasure in the world? That&rsquo;s something
like! Imagine finding gold trees and birds eating jewels on the Sea
Monster! By the way, do you know about
&lsquo;Cornelia&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said I thought she had something to do with sitting on a hill
and her children turning to stone one after the other, but Jerry
said that was Niobe and that it was she who turned to stone, not the
children. He has a fearfully long memory. So we put on the light
again and looked it up in &ldquo;The Reader&rsquo;s Handbook,&rdquo;
because we didn&rsquo;t want to bother the grown-ups, and we found,
of course, that she was the Roman lady who pointed at her sons and
said, &ldquo;These are my jewels!&rdquo; when somebody asked her
where her gold and ornaments were. So naturally the Bottle Man
didn&rsquo;t feel like repeating such a complimentary thing, being
an un-stuck-up person, but we did think it was nice of his
mother.</p>

<p>We put away the &ldquo;Handbook&rdquo; and made the room dark
again and were arguing over all the exciting places in the Bottle
Man&rsquo;s story, when Greg spoke up suddenly from the corner where
we&rsquo;d almost forgotten him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If <i>I</i> found a thing like those mer-persons,&rdquo;
he said drowsily, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let it bite me. I&rsquo;d
keep it in the bath-tub and teach it how to do things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like your precious toad, I suppose,&rdquo; said Jerry.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be idiotic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we all went to bed, and I, for one, dreamed about all kinds of
glittering treasures and heaps of jewels each as big as your hat,
and of our nice old Bottle Man, with his long white beard flowing in
the wind.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<div class="text">

<p class="first">I must say at the beginning that it was all my
fault. Jerry says that it was just as much his, but it wasn&rsquo;t,
because I&rsquo;m the oldest and I ought to have known better. To
begin with, Father had to go to New York to give a talk at the
American Architects&rsquo; League, or something, and Mother decided
to go with him. At the last minute Aunt Ailsa got a weekend
invitation from somebody she hadn&rsquo;t seen for ages and went
away, too, which left us alone with Katy and Lena. Katy has been
with us next to forever and took care of Jerry and Greg when they
were Infant Babes, so that Mother never imagined, of course, that
anything could happen in two days. It wasn&rsquo;t Katy&rsquo;s
fault either. </p>


<p>The first day was foggy, and the garden dripped, so we went down
to call on Captain Moss, who lives near the ferry-landing. Besides
having boats for hire, he sells such things as fishing-tackle and
very strong-smelling rope, and sometimes salt herring on a stick.
The things he sells are all mixed up with parts of his own boats and
pieces of canvas and rope-ends, and curly shavings that skitter
across the floor when the wind blows in from the harbor. There is a
window at one end of his shop-place that goes all the way to the
floor, like a doorway, and it is always open. His shop is half on
the ferry-wharf so that the window hangs right over the water, very
high above it. It is quite a dizzyish place, but wonderful to look
out at. Far away you see boats coming in, and Wecanicut all flat and
gray, and then right below is nice sloshy green water with old boxes
and straws floating by, and sometimes horrid orange-peels that
picnic people throw in.</p>

<p>That afternoon Captain Moss was mending the stern of one of his
boats, and when we asked him what he was fitting on, he said:
&ldquo;Rudder-gudgeons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He grunted it out so funnily that it sounded just like some queer
old flounder trying to talk, and we thought he was joking. But he
wasn&rsquo;t at all. Sometimes he is very nice and tells us the
longest yarns about when he shipped on a whaler, but this time he
was busy and the rudder-gudgeons didn&rsquo;t behave right, I think,
so he let us do all the talking. We told him a good deal about the
bottle, and also something about the city under the sea. He said he
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder at it, for there was powerful curious things
under the sea. He also said he supposed now we&rsquo;d be wanting to
hire the <i>Jolly Nancy</i> &ldquo;fer to find submarine cities,
sence he wouldn&rsquo;t let us have her to go a-stavin&rsquo; in her
bottom on them rocks off Wecanicut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We decided that he really didn&rsquo;t want to be bothered, so we
went away presently. To soothe him, Jerry bought some of the dry
herring things and carried them home in a pasteboard box that said
&ldquo;1/2 doz. galvanized line cleats. Extra quality&rdquo; on the
lid. Lena cooked the herrings for supper, but I don&rsquo;t think
she could have done it right, because they were quite horrid.</p>

<p>The second day was the perfectly gorgeous kind that makes you
want to go off to seek your fortune or dance on top of a high hill
or do anything rather than stay at home, however nice your own
garden may be. We agreed about this at breakfast, and I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Wecanicut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d never gone to Wecanicut alone, but I couldn&rsquo;t
see any reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t. Captain Lewis, on the ferry,
always watches over every one on board with a fatherly sort of eye,
and Wecanicut itself is a perfectly safe, mild place, without any
quicksands or tigers or anything that Mother would object to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what,&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
make it a real adventure and take some costumes along. We never had
any proper ones there before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought this was a rather good idea, and after breakfast we
went up to select things that wouldn&rsquo;t be too bothersome to
carry, from the Property Basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it to be pirates or smugglers or what?&rdquo; Greg
asked, poking in the corner where he keeps his own special rigs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explorers, my fine fellow,&rdquo; Jerry said,
&ldquo;exploring after a submerged city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Greg said, evidently changing his ideas.</p>

<p>Jerry and I went down to ask Katy to make us some lunch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just food; nothing careful,&rdquo; Jerry explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are ye goin&rsquo; to do with it?&rdquo; Katy
asked.</p>

<p>Jerry was all ready to say, &ldquo;Eat it, of course,&rdquo; but
I saw what Katy meant and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going out; it&rsquo;s such a nice day. We
thought we&rsquo;d take our lunch with us to save Lena
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get streelin&rsquo; off too far,&rdquo; Katy
said, &ldquo;Where are ye goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, down by the shore,&rdquo; I said, which was not quite
the whole truth, because of course it was not our shore, but the
shore of Wecanicut I meant. Yes, <i>all</i> of it was my fault.</p>

<p>Just as we were putting the lunch into the kit-bag Greg came
staggering downstairs, trailing along the weirdest lot of stuff
he&rsquo;d collected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth is all that?&rdquo; Jerry asked him.
&ldquo;Drop it and get your hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;my costume,&rdquo; Greg explained, out of
breath from having dragged all the things down from the attic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glory!&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose
you&rsquo;re going to lug all that rubbish on to the ferry, do you?
Not while <i>I&rsquo;m</i> with you, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t begin to put on half of it,
Gregs,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s weed it out a
little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look sharp about it,&rdquo; Jerry said,
jingling the money for the ferry in his pocket.</p>

<p>Greg finally took a Turkish fez thing, and a black-and-orange
sash, and a white brocade waistcoat that Father once had for a
masque ball ages ago. We hadn&rsquo;t time to tell him that it was
no sort of outfit for an explorer, so we bundled the things up with
our own and stuffed them all into the kit-bag on top of the
lunch.</p>

<p>Luke Street has a turn in it just beyond our house, so neither
Katy nor Lena could have seen which way we went; anyhow, I think
they were both in the back kitchen, which looks out on the
clothes-yard. I thought perhaps we should have told Katy where we
were going after all, but Jerry said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks, Chris; we&rsquo;re not babies. I suppose
you&rsquo;d like Katy to take us in a perambulator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was horrid of him, but he made up for everything later
on.</p>

<p>Our Captain Lewis was not in the pilot-house of the
<i>Wecanicut</i>. Instead there was a strange captain, a scraggly,
cross-looking person, staring at a little book and not watching the
people who came on board, the way Captain Lewis does. Jerry and I
sat on campstools on the windy side, and Greg went to watch the
walking-beam, which he thinks will some day knock the top off its
house. It always stops and plunges down just when he thinks it
surely will forget and go smashing on up through the roof. He is
quite disappointed that it never does. It behaved perfectly properly
this time and paddled the old ferry-boat over to Wecanicut as
usual.</p>

<p>We went up the hot little road that goes from the landing, and
then ran through a prickly, stony short-cut that leads among wild
rose-bushes and sweet fern to our part of the shore. There were tiny
little wavelets splashing over the rocks, and you couldn&rsquo;t
think which was bluer&mdash;the sea or the sky. The first thing we
did was to bury our bottle of root-beer in a pool up to its neck and
mark the place with two white stones. This is something we have
learned by experience, for nothing is nastier than warm root-beer.
Then we put on the costumes and capered about a little. I had a
tight, striped football jersey, and my gym bloomers, and a black,
villainous-looking felt hat; and Jerry had a ruffle pinned on the
front of his shirt, and a wide belt with the big tinfoil-covered
buckle that Mother made for us once, and a felt hat fastened up on
the sides so that it looked like a real three-cornered one. Greg had
arrayed himself in his things, and he did look too absurd,
with more than a foot of the brocade waistcoat dangling below the
sash, the end of which trailed on the ground behind.</p>

<p>It gave us a queer, wild feeling, being there without the
grown-ups, and we decided to tell them that as we&rsquo;d proved we
could do it, we might go again. We never did tell them that, as it
happens.</p>

<p>We all grew hungry so soon that we had lunch much earlier than
the grown-ups would have had it. The food Katy had fixed was
wonderful, though rather squashed on account of all the costumes
being on top of it in the kit-bag. While we ate we organized the
Submerged-City-Seeking-Expedition. Jerry was &ldquo;Terry
Loganshaw,&rdquo; in charge of the party, and I was
&ldquo;Christopher Hole, shipmaster,&rdquo; and Greg was
&ldquo;Baroo, the Madagascar cabin-boy,&rdquo; because we
couldn&rsquo;t think of what else he could be, with such
clothes.</p>

<p>We tidied up all the picnic things so that there was nothing
left, and put the root-beer bottle into the kit-bag, because it was
a good one with a patent top. The kit-bag we took with us for
duffle, and we set off for the point. We went by the longest way we
could think of, to make it seem like a real
expedition,&mdash;&rsquo;cross country and back again. Jerry led us
through the scratchy, overgrown part of Wecanicut, and we pretended
that it was a long, weary <i>trek</i> through the most poisonous
jungles to the coast of Peru; and when Greg walked right into a
spider&rsquo;s web with a huge yellow spider gloating in the middle
of it, he said he&rsquo;d been bitten by a tarantula. We told him
that we should have to leave him there to die, for we must press on
to the sea, but he cured himself by eating a magic sweet-fern leaf
and came running after us, tripping over his sash. The
<i>trekking</i> took a long time, and when we reached the end of the
point we were quite exhausted and flung our weary frames down on the
tropic sand to rest. All at once Jerry clutched my arm and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look yonder, Hole! Does not yon strange form appear to you
like the topper-most minaret of a sunken tower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was pointing at the Sea Monster, and it really did look much
more like a rough sort of dome than a monster&rsquo;s head. There
was a lot of haze in the air, which made it look bluish and
mysterious instead of rocky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It do indeed, sir,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Could it be that
city we be seeking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would that we had a boat!&rdquo; said Greg, which might
have been quite proper if he&rsquo;d been somebody else, instead of
Baroo.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d been sprawling on the sand again for quite a while,
when Jerry suddenly jumped up and shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glory! Look, Chris!&rdquo; not at all like Terry
Loganshaw.</p>

<p>I did look, and saw what he had seen. It was an empty boat, a
sort of dinghy, bobbing and butting along beside the rocks a little
way down the shore. We all ran helter-skelter, and Jerry pulled off
his shoes like a flash and waded out and pulled the boat in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of those old tubs from around the
ferry-landing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It must have got adrift and
come down with the tide. Oars in it and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We stood there silently, Jerry in the water holding the boat, and
we were all thinking the same thing. It was Greg who said it first,
quite solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could go out to the Sea Monster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course it was then that I ought to have said that we
couldn&rsquo;t, but Jerry pulled the boat up the beach and ran back
to the end of the point to see how high the waves were before I
could say it. It was too late to say it afterwards, because when we
saw that there was not even the faintest curl of white foam around
the Sea Monster, it did seem as though we could do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only take about five minutes to row out
there,&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;and then we&rsquo;ll have seen it
at last. It couldn&rsquo;t be a better time. Why, a newly hatched
duckling could swim out there to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did look very near, and the water was calm and shiny, with
just a long, heaving roll now and then, as if something underneath
were humping its shoulders.</p>

<p>So I said, &ldquo;All right; let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and we climbed
into the boat. Jerry rows very well, and he pulled both the oars
while I bailed with an old tin can that I found under the stern
thwart. The boat didn&rsquo;t leak badly enough to worry about, but
I thought it might be just as well to keep it bailed. We talked in a
very nautical way, though Jerry kept forgetting he was Terry
Loganshaw and mixing up &ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo; and Captain
Moss. But I didn&rsquo;t feel so much like being Chris Hole, anyway,
even to please the boys, and I didn&rsquo;t say much.</p>

<p>The Sea Monster was much further away than you might suppose.
When there was ever so much smooth, swelling water between us and
Wecanicut, the Monster&rsquo;s head still seemed almost as far away
as before. Somehow the water looked very deep, although you
couldn&rsquo;t see down into it, and it humped itself under the
boat.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<div class="text">
<p class="first">Presently Wecanicut began to drop further away, and
then the Sea Monster loomed up suddenly right over us, and Jerry had
to fend the boat off with an oar. We had never guessed how big the
thing really was,&mdash;not big at all for an island, but very large
for a bare, off-shore rock. I should say that it was just about the
bigness of an ordinary house, and very black and beetling, with not
a spear of grass or anything on it. When Jerry said, &ldquo;My
stars, <i>what</i> a weird place!&rdquo; his voice went booming and
rumbling in among the rocks, and a lot of gulls flew up suddenly,
flapping and shrieking. He held the boat up against the edge of a
rock while Greg and I got out. We took the kit-bag ashore, and Jerry
made the boat fast by putting a big piece of stone on top of the
rope. There was nothing like a beach or even a shelving rock to pull
it up on, so that was the best we could do. The boat backed away as
far as it could, but the rope was firmly wedged between the rock and
the stone so it couldn&rsquo;t get away.</p>

<p>Of course we went first to look at the black cave-entrance. Sure
enough, a great flat slab had fallen down from it and lay half in
the water,&mdash;we could see scratchy marks and broken places where
it had slid. The cave itself was about six feet deep, and very dank
and dismal-looking. There was no sign of there ever having been
treasure, for nobody could possibly have buried it, unless
they&rsquo;d hewn places in the living rock, like ancient Egyptians.
We might have thought of that before, but of course we didn&rsquo;t
honestly believe that there was treasure. Somehow the Sea Monster
didn&rsquo;t seem nearly so jolly and exciting as it had from
Wecanicut. It was so real and big, and whenever a wave came in, it
boomed and echoed under the hanging-over rocks. We climbed around to
the other side and went up on top of the highest place, which was
about three times as high as I am. From there we could see the
Headland, very far away and blue, and Wecanicut behind us, safe and
green and friendly-looking, but a long way off; and nothing else but
a smeary line of smoke from a steamer at sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We named this place well,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;it
<i>is</i> a Monster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brrrr, hear it roar!&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;The waves
must be bigger, or something. There weren&rsquo;t any when we came
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We looked down and saw that the water was behaving differently.
Instead of being smooth and rolling, there was a skitter of sharp
ripples all over it, and the waves went <i>slap</i> and frothed
white when they hit the rock. The sky had changed, too. It was not
so blue, and there were switchy mares&rsquo; tails across it, and
the wind was blowing from Wecanicut, instead of toward it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better start back,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll be late for the next ferry, as
it is, and Father and Mother will be home on the six o&rsquo;clock
train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Jerry, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten that.
It&rsquo;s latish already, judging by the sun. Come along, Greg, and
loop up your sash so you won&rsquo;t fall off this beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> latish. The sun was quite low, and we saw that the
Sea Monster threw a long, queer shadow on the water, as if the sea
had been land. We hurried along to the boat, Jerry ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he shouted, turning
around.</p>

<p>When he turned back he made a sort of wild spring that I
didn&rsquo;t understand at first. Then I saw the stone we had put
over the rope rolling off the rock,&mdash;joggled off by the
boat&rsquo;s pulling harder when a wave lifted it. The stone rolled
in cornery bounces, with a dull noise, and the rope slipped after it
slowly. I thought Jerry would be in time. I couldn&rsquo;t believe
that I really saw the rope floating its whole length on the water,
dry at first, then darkening wetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang on, Chris!&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;I can get
it.&rdquo;</p> <a name="fig3"></a> <div class="figure"><img
src="images/image3.png" alt="&ldquo;Hang on, Chris!&rdquo; Jerry
said." /></div>

<p>I caught his hand, and he snatched after the rope. But he plunged
wildly, nearly pulling me in, and scrambled up at once with one leg
wet to the hip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bottom at all,&rdquo; he said queerly.
&ldquo;I believe the thing rises straight out of the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By that time the boat was ten feet away from the Monster. It
circled once, very quietly, as if it were trying to decide which way
to go, and then it drifted gently away toward the sea, with the rope
trailing along like a snake swimming beside it.</p>

<p>We stood there looking at the boat until it faded to a hazy
speck, and by that time the sun was really low. I don&rsquo;t think
Greg altogether realized what had happened. We&rsquo;d played at
being marooned so often that I suppose he didn&rsquo;t quite see
that this was different.</p>

<p>I hope that I shall never, never forget, as long as I live, what
a brick Jerry was through the whole of that nightmarish thing. I
know I never shall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chris,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you stay on this side.
I&rsquo;ll go around to the Headland side. Greg, you climb up on
top. If any of us sees a boat near enough to do any good, call the
others, and we&rsquo;ll all yell and wave things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never heard his voice so commanding, even in plays. He
still had on the cocked hat, and it looked very strange indeed. We
scattered as he ordered, and when the others had gone, I remembered
that Greg had on slippery-soled shoes instead of sneakers, which we
usually wear. I thought of calling after him to be careful, but he
never was a falling-down sort of person, even as a baby. I hoped,
too, that he would have sense enough to loop up that sash or take it
off entirely.</p>

 <p>I sat on the Wecanicut side and stared at the shore and the
 water till my eyes ached. More and more wind was blowing all the
 time, straight from Wecanicut. It blew so hard in my face that my
 eyes watered and I couldn&rsquo;t be sure whether or not I did see
 boats. In books, people think of all their past sins when
 they&rsquo;re in perilous positions, but all I could think of was
 that a boat <i>must</i> come before dark. I did think of how much
 it all was my fault, but that was not far enough in the past to
 count. Presently Jerry came back and said that if we moved a little
 toward each other we could see just as much of the bay and consult
 at the same time. So we did, and sat down not very far apart.
 <i>I</i> said that I supposed we ought to change off with Greg,
 because it was horrid lonely up there, but Jerry said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense; he likes to be alone. He&rsquo;s probably
pretending he&rsquo;s the King of the Cannibal Isle, or something,
and not worrying a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was looking us up in the dictionary the other
day,&rdquo; I said, trying to forget the Sea Monster for a minute,
&ldquo;and <i>Gregory</i> means &lsquo;watchful,
vigilant&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s the first time he&rsquo;s ever lived up to his
name, then,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;Keep looking, Chris, and
don&rsquo;t moon about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We sat there for quite a long time without saying anything, and
the last little golden sliver of sun disappeared behind the point,
and the lighthouse on the Headland came out suddenly, though it was
still quite light, and began to wink&mdash;two long flashes and two
short ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer,&rdquo; Jerry said, &ldquo;to think
that people are there and we can&rsquo;t possibly tell
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than queer,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>Then we were still again, till presently Jerry said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that funny noise, Chris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had been listening to it just then, and said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
and that I supposed it was the horrid noise the water made around on
the other side. For quite a time we didn&rsquo;t hear it, and then
Jerry said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is again! The water must suck into those echoey
hollows. It sounds almost like a person groaning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>All at once he turned toward me and said in a queer, quick
voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose it could possibly be Greg?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t describe the way I felt when he said it, but if
you&rsquo;ve ever felt the same you know what I mean. It was a
little as though something heavy dropped from my throat down to my
toes, through me, leaving me all empty, with cold, tingly things
rushing up again to my head. They were still rushing as we flew
around the rock, and I kept saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be Greg.... It <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
be....&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was.</p>

<p>He was lying doubled up, just below the high place where Jerry
had told him to keep watch. We didn&rsquo;t dare to touch him,
because we didn&rsquo;t know how badly he was hurt, and he
couldn&rsquo;t seem to tell us. But when I tried to put my arm under
him, he pushed me a little and said, &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; so I
stopped. Then I saw that his right arm was twisted under him
horridly and that his shoulder looked all wrong. I touched it very
gently and asked him if it was that, and he said, &ldquo;Yes;
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; We had to get him out somehow from that jaggedy
place in the rocks where he was lying. So Jerry got him under the
arm that wasn&rsquo;t hurt, and I took his legs, and we hauled him
to a flattish part of the rock.</p>

<p>I pulled off the football jersey and put it under him, and Jerry
ran back to get my skirt, which I&rsquo;d put in the kit-bag when we
fixed our costumes. Just after Jerry had gone something dreadful
happened. Quite suddenly Greg seemed to shrink smaller, and his face
grew rather greenish and not at all like his, and his hand was
perfectly cold when I snatched it. I suppose he&rsquo;d fainted from
our carrying him so stupidly, but I&rsquo;d never seen anybody do it
before and I didn&rsquo;t know that was the way it looked. I&rsquo;d
never heard of people dying from hurting their arms, but I thought
that perhaps he was hurt somewhere else that we didn&rsquo;t know
about. But by the time Jerry came back with the skirt Greg had
opened his eyes and looked at me a little like himself. There is a
book in our medicine cupboard at home called, &ldquo;Hints on First
Aid.&rdquo; Jerry and I used to like to look at it, and Father
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead; you may need it some day.&rdquo; But neither of
us could remember anything that was at all useful now. I could
plainly see the picture of some queerly-drawn hands doing a
&ldquo;Spanish Windlass,&rdquo; but that wouldn&rsquo;t have done
poor Greg any good at all. Jerry did remember that you ought to cut
people&rsquo;s clothes and not try to take them off in the ordinary
way, so he took out his knife and ripped up the sleeve of
Greg&rsquo;s jumper and the shoulder-seam of the white brocaded
waistcoat. I don&rsquo;t see how people can stand being Red Cross
nurses in France, for I&rsquo;m sure I never could be one.
Greg&rsquo;s shoulder was quite awful,&mdash;what we could see, for
it was almost dark now. There was nothing at all we dared to do. We
couldn&rsquo;t even bathe it, for there was only sea-water, so I
just sat and held Greg&rsquo;s other hand and patted it. He
didn&rsquo;t cry,&mdash;I think the hurting was too bad for
that,&mdash;but he moaned a little, and sometimes he said,
&ldquo;Hurts, Chris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to tell him a story, the way I did when we all had the
measles and he was so much sicker than the rest of us, but he
couldn&rsquo;t listen. So we just sat there in the dark&mdash;it was
perfectly dark now and we couldn&rsquo;t see one another at
all&mdash;and I began to count the flashes of the Headland
light&mdash;two long and two short, two long and two
short&mdash;till I thought I should scream. Suddenly Jerry said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you hungry, Chris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said that I wasn&rsquo;t, and asked him if he was. But he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not very.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were real waves on the Wecanicut side of the Monster now,
and the wind was still blowing from that direction harder than ever.
Now and then a drop of spray would flick my cheek, and I think the
sound of the wind around the rock was really more horrid than the
noise the water made. It seemed like midnight, but it was really
quite early in the evening, when Jerry saw the lights bobbing along
the shore of Wecanicut. They were lanterns, two of them, and they
stopped quite often, as if the people were looking for something.
For a minute I couldn&rsquo;t even move. Then I scrambled and slid
after Jerry to the place on the Monster that most nearly faced the
Wecanicut point. I don&rsquo;t think Greg really knew we&rsquo;d
left him; at least he didn&rsquo;t make a sound.</p>

<p>The lanterns swung and bobbed nearer till they almost reached the
point, and we could hear faint shouts. Jerry and I braced our feet
against the slimy rocks and shrieked into the dark, and the wind
rushed down our throats and burned them. We could hear the people
quite clearly now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Father&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; Jerry said.
&ldquo;Oh, Chris, the wind is dead against us. <i>Now</i> for
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d always thought Jerry could shout louder than any boy I
ever heard, but you can&rsquo;t imagine how high and thin both our
voices sounded out there on the Sea Monster. We heard Father&rsquo;s
voice quite distinctly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chris-ti-ine ... Jer-r-r-y ... ti-in-e!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We shouted till our chests felt scraped raw, the way you feel
when you&rsquo;ve run too hard, and the wind tore our voices
straight out to sea, away from Wecanicut. The lanterns stood quite
still for a minute more, and then they bobbed away. At first I
didn&rsquo;t believe that they were really growing smaller and
smaller. But they were, and at last they were gone entirely, far
down the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you crying, Chris?&rdquo; Jerry said suddenly, in a
queer, wheezy voice. He&rsquo;d been shouting even harder than I
had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; I said, and my own voice was very
strange indeed.</p>

<p>Jerry whacked me hard on the back, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good old Chris! <i>Good</i> old Chris!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shore of Wecanicut was so black that we might have dreamed
the lanterns, but I still could hear the way Father&rsquo;s own
voice had sounded, calling &ldquo;Chris-ti-ine!&rdquo; We almost
stumbled over Greg when we crawled back to him, and he said:
&ldquo;Can we go home now, Chris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wind gnashed around in a spiteful kind of way, and Jerry
touched my hand suddenly and said: &ldquo;Chris, it&rsquo;s
raining.&rdquo; </p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<div class="text">

<p class="first">It <i>was</i> raining,&mdash;big cold splashes that
came faster and faster. I felt my blouse stick coldly to my shoulder
in the places where it was wet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We <i>can&rsquo;t</i> let Greg lie there and have it rain
on him,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>Jerry and I thought of the pirate cave at the same moment, but we
didn&rsquo;t see how we could possibly carry Greg to it in the dark.
We thought that as it wasn&rsquo;t his legs that were hurt he might
be able to walk there, if we helped him. He was very brave and quite
willing to try, though a little dazed about why we wanted him to,
but when we stood him carefully on his feet, he said,
&ldquo;Chris&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo; and we had to lay him down
again. By this time it was really raining, and I put the skirt over
Greg, instead of under him, while we tried to think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might work if we made a chair,&rdquo; Jerry
suggested.</p>

<p>So we stooped down and clasped each other&rsquo;s wrists
criss-cross, the way you do to make a human chair, and got Greg on
to it, with the arm that wasn&rsquo;t hurt around my neck. The
darkness was perfectly pitchy, and we had to feel for every step to
be sure that it was a solid place and not the slippery edge that
went straight down into the sea. Greg cried a little and said,
&ldquo;<i>Please&mdash;</i>stop.&rdquo; I could feel his hair
against my face. It was all wet, and his cheek was wet, too, and
cold.</p>

<p>The rain blew a little way into the cave, but not much, and we
put Greg as far back as we could. The bottom of the cave was very
jaggy and not comfortable to lie on, but we made it as soft as we
could with the skirt and the jersey. I tripped and stumbled against
Jerry, and when I caught him I felt that he was shivering. His shirt
was quite wet. When I asked him if he was cold, he said &ldquo;Not
very,&rdquo; and we crawled into the cave place beside Greg, and sat
as close together as possible to keep warm. We couldn&rsquo;t see
the Headland light, and I was rather glad, because it had made me
almost crazy, flashing and flashing so steadily and not caring a
bit.</p>

<p>The rain went <i>plop</i> into the pools, and made a flattish,
spattery sound on the rock. I don&rsquo;t know why I thought of the
&ldquo;Air Religieux&rdquo; just then, but I suppose it was because
of the rain. I could see the straight yellow candle-flames all blue
around the wick, and Father&rsquo;s head tucked down looking at the
&rsquo;cello, and his hands, nice and strong, playing it; then I got
a little mixed and heard him calling &ldquo;Christi-ine,&rdquo;
fainter and fainter. I think I must have been almost asleep, because
I know the real rain surprised me, like something I&rsquo;d
forgotten, and a very sharp, cornery rock was poking into my
back.</p>

<p>It was then that Greg said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want&mdash;Simpson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That frightened me more than anything almost, for Simpson was a
sort of stuffed flannel duck-thing that he&rsquo;d had when he was
very little, and he hadn&rsquo;t thought of it for years. None of us
ever knew why he called it &ldquo;Simpson,&rdquo; but he adored the
thing and made it sleep beside him in the crib every night. But that
was when he was three, and &ldquo;Simpson&rdquo; had been for ages
on the top shelf where we keep the toys that we think we&rsquo;ll
play with again sometime before we&rsquo;re really grown up. We
never have done it yet, but there are certain ones that we
couldn&rsquo;t possibly give away, not even to the Deservingest poor
children.</p>

<p>So when Greg said that, in a tired, far-off sort of way, it did
frighten me, because I <i>had</i> heard of people dying when they
were ravingly delirious. Greg wasn&rsquo;t raving exactly, but it
was almost worse, because his voice was so small and different from
his own dear usual one. When I told him I couldn&rsquo;t get Simpson
I tried to make my voice sound soft and cooey like Mother&rsquo;s
when she&rsquo;s sorry, but it went up into a queer squeak instead,
and I couldn&rsquo;t finish somehow. Greg kept saying,
&ldquo;Simpson;&mdash;please&mdash;&rdquo; and crying to
himself.</p>

<p>I heard Jerry feeling around in the dark and then the click of
his knife opening. I couldn&rsquo;t think what he was doing, but
after quite a long time he pushed something into my hand and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that feel anything like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; I said, but the next minute I knew.</p>

<p>It <i>did</i> feel like Simpson&mdash;soft and flannelly, with a
round, bumpy sort of head at one end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how did you do it!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Oh, Jerry,
you brick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I chopped a big piece out of your skirt,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind. I happened to have the string
off the sandwich bundle in my pocket, and I squeezed up a head and
tied it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Greg was a little frightened when Jerry leaned over him
suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just me, Greg,&rdquo; Jerry said; &ldquo;just
Jerry-o. Here&rsquo;s Simpson, old lamb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never heard Jerry&rsquo;s voice at all like that
before. I don&rsquo;t know whether Greg really thought it was
Simpson, but he took it and sighed&mdash;a long, quivery sort of
sigh, the way very little children do when they&rsquo;re asleep
sometimes.</p>

<p>Then there was no sound at all but the different horrid noises
that the Monster made.</p>

<p>Presently I felt Jerry start, and then he shuffled back a little
so that he was quite tight against my knees. I asked him what was
the matter, and he said &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; After a while,
though, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chris, I&rsquo;d better tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Oh, what <i>is</i> it?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember how the tide was when we came out?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;on the ebb. Don&rsquo;t you
remember the rocks at Wecanicut, with bushels of wet sea-weed
hanging off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand for a minute, then I whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wave just hit my foot,&rdquo; said Jerry in a low
voice.</p>

<p>The first thing that we did was a lot of quick figuring. We
thought fearfully hard and remembered that Turkshead Rock was just
coming out of water when we left Wecanicut at four o&rsquo;clock, so
that the tide must have been within about an hour of ebb. Therefore
full flood would be at eleven o&rsquo;clock. But we hadn&rsquo;t any
idea of whether it was ten or eleven or twelve, because there was no
light to see Jerry&rsquo;s watch by. He had just an ordinary
Ingersoll, not the grand Radiolite kind that you can see in the dark
and it was perfectly maddening to hear it ticking away cheerfully,
and no good to us at all. Just then something cold wrapped itself
around my ankle. It was the edge of another wavelet.</p>

<p>We knew that if the cave was going to be flooded we must get Greg
out of it before the water came much higher, but it was still
raining pitch-forks outside, and we didn&rsquo;t know whether to
risk waiting a bit longer or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there&rsquo;s sea-weed and we can feel high
watermark,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Try, Jerry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We felt all the way around the sides of the cave toward the
bottom, but as far as we could tell there was no sea-weed at
all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t help us much,&rdquo; Jerry said,
&ldquo;because we don&rsquo;t know whether the tide is really full
now and has covered it, or whether it just doesn&rsquo;t grow
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We curled our feet under us and waited. We could hear the water
sloshing around very close to us. Once when I put out my hand it
went right into a cold pool. It was then that Jerry had a most
wonderful idea. I heard his knife snap open again and asked him what
it was this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I take the crystal off my watch,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I can feel where the hands are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard the little clicking pop that the front of a watch makes
when you pry it off, and I knew he was feeling the hands very
gently.</p>


<p>&ldquo;The little one&rsquo;s in line with the winder stem
thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the big one&mdash;Chris,
it&rsquo;s about twenty minutes of twelve. The water
<i>can&rsquo;t</i> come any higher. We must have had the worst of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was queer that I cried then, because I hadn&rsquo;t felt at
all like crying when we thought that the cave would be flooded.</p>

<p>Greg had been quiet for so long that it frightened me suddenly,
and I groped after him to be sure that he was all right. I found his
hand, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe that it was really hot when ours
were so cold. His forehead was hot, too, and dry, in spite of his
hair being damp still from the rain. He curled his hand into mine
and said very clearly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please bring me a drink of water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was perfectly awful, because he said it so politely and very
carefully, as if he were trying not to bother somebody. And there
was no drink to give him. I thought of the people in stories who lie
on deserts and battle-fields burning in agonies of fever, but I
couldn&rsquo;t remember reading about anybody dying of fever on a
rock in the middle of the sea. I dipped my handkerchief in the pool
just beside me and laid it, all dripping, on Greg&rsquo;s forehead.
I didn&rsquo;t know whether it was a proper First Aid thing to do,
but he seemed to like it and was still again, holding my hand.
Presently he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, why isn&rsquo;t there a drink?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is awful, Chris,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>

<p>Then I thought of the rain-pools. There were lots, of course, in
the hollows of the Monster, but we had nothing to scoop up the water
with. Greg&rsquo;s forehead was just as hot as ever, and he thrashed
about and hurt his shoulder and cried miserably.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how Jerry could have thought of so many
things; for it was he who thought of very carefully breaking the
bottom off the root-beer bottle and using it for a cup. Of course
the bottom might have cracked all to pieces, but it was quite heavy
and Jerry was very careful. It came off wonderfully well, though
rather jaggy. Jerry tried to grind the cutty edges off by rubbing
them against the rock, but it didn&rsquo;t work. Then we remembered
being very thirsty once on a long picnic-walk ages ago, and Father
wrapping his handkerchief around the top of the tin can the soup had
come in and giving us a drink at a pump. So we knew that we could do
that with the broken bottle. Jerry dodged out into the rain through
the tide-pools and came back after a while with some water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because
the place I found was very shallow, but I can go again.&rdquo;</p>


<p>I remembered reading in books that you mustn&rsquo;t give much
water to fever-stricken people in any case. We lifted Greg&rsquo;s
head up,&mdash;that is, Jerry did, while I held the root-beer bottle
glass, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the drink, Gregs, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was very hard to tell what I was doing, and some of the water
trickled over the handkerchief and down the front of Greg&rsquo;s
jumper. But he drank the rest, and said: &ldquo;Thank you very
much&rdquo; in the same careful voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish he wouldn&rsquo;t be so blooming polite!&rdquo;
Jerry said sharply, as we were laying Greg back again, and I felt
something wet and warm splash down on my wrist. But I didn&rsquo;t
tell Jerry I&rsquo;d felt it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<div class="text">

<p class="first">If I wrote volumes and volumes I couldn&rsquo;t
begin to tell how long that night seemed. It was longer than years
and years in prison; it was as long as a century. I think Jerry
slept a little, and perhaps I did, too, for when I peered out at the
cave entrance again there were two or three bluish, wet stars in the
piece of sky I could see, and the rain-sound had stopped. Jerry was
huddled up at my feet with his dear old head propped uncomfortably
against me. He was snoring a little, and somehow it was the nicest
sound I&rsquo;d ever heard. Greg&rsquo;s hand was still in mine, and
it was not very hot.</p>

<p>Dawn always disappoints me a little. You think it&rsquo;s going
to be perfectly gorgeous, and then it&rsquo;s usually nothing but
one cold, pinkish streak, and the shadows all going the wrong way.
But when I saw a faint wet grayness beginning to creep along the
horizon beyond the Headland, I thought it was the most wonderful
thing I&rsquo;d ever seen in my life. The gray spread till the whole
sky was the color of zinc, with the sea a little darker, and then
one spikey yellow strip began to show on the sky-line. I could see
Greg at last, with the jersey under his head, and the white brocade
waistcoat all dark and stained at the shoulder, and his poor dear
face ghastly white. And Jerry asleep, with the ruffle still pinned
to his wet shirt and a big hole torn in the knee of his
knickerbockers. And I saw the slimy pools that the tide had left
beside us&mdash;it was on the ebb again&mdash;and the pieces of the
root-beer bottle that Jerry had broken off, and the horrible, high,
black head of the Sea Monster above us.</p>

<p>There was no boat of any sort to be seen, near or far away, but I
woke Jerry so that we could both keep watch in case one came. Just
as Jerry crawled out of the cave and stretched himself stiffly, Greg
took his hand away from mine and blinked out at the sky, and said in
almost his own voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have we been here all the time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, all the time, ducky,&rdquo; I said, and then I cried,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to move, Gregs!&rdquo; for I saw him trying
to squirm over.</p>

<p>He lay back and said &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; but then in an instant he
knew why. I couldn&rsquo;t do anything but cuddle my cheek down
against his, and he sobbed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make me stop crying, Chris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The light grew stronger and stronger till there were shadows
among the rocks and Wecanicut came out green and brown. Jerry came
back presently, and I wondered if he&rsquo;d seen anything, but he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chris, I just wanted to ask you. How long does it take for
a person to starve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said days, I thought, and Jerry sighed a little and went back
to his watching-place. Somehow I didn&rsquo;t feel very hungry,
myself,&mdash;that is, not the kind of hungry you are when
you&rsquo;ve played tennis all morning and then gone in swimming.
There was a sharp, sickish feeling inside me and my head felt a
little queer, but it was not exactly like being hungry.</p>

<p>I think Greg&rsquo;s arm must have stopped hurting quite so
badly, or else he was being tremendously spunky, because we talked a
lot and I told him that Father would come for us pretty soon. I
didn&rsquo;t feel at all sure of this, because I knew that Father
would never have given up the Sea Monster the night before if
he&rsquo;d had any idea we were there. But it was so perfectly
blessed to have Greg talking sensibly at all, even with such a
wobbly sort of voice, that I didn&rsquo;t much care what I said.</p>

<p>All at once Jerry came tumbling around the corner, shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Chris, come quick! <i>Hurry</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I left Greg and ran after Jerry, and I&rsquo;d been sitting so
long humped up on the rocks that my knees gave way and I barked my
shins against a sharp ledge. I didn&rsquo;t even know it until ever
so long afterwards, when I found a bruise as big as a saucer and
remembered then. Jerry didn&rsquo;t need to point so wildly out
across the water; I saw the boat before he could say a word. It was
a catboat, quite far off, tacking down from the Headland. The sail
was orange, and we&rsquo;d never seen an orange sail in our harbor
or anywhere, in fact, so we knew it must be a strange boat.</p>

<p>Jerry pulled off his shirt like winking and stood there in his
bare arms waving it madly. We both began to shout before the catboat
people could possibly have heard us, but we thought that they might
see the white shirt flying up and down. The boat was tacking a long
leg and a short one. The long one carried it so far out that we
thought it was going to cross the mouth of the bay and not come near
enough to see us. Jerry stopped shouting just long enough to
gasp:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When she&rsquo;s all ready to go about on the short tack
is the time to yell loudest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the next short tack seemed to bring the boat no nearer than
before, and the long leg carried it so far away that it was no more
use shouting to the orange sail than to a stupid old
herring-gull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you wave for a bit, Chris?&rdquo; Jerry said.
&ldquo;My arms are off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I took the shirt and waved it by its sleeves, and the catboat
began another short tack. It was just then that we saw something
black flap-flapping against the sail.</p>


<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve tied a coat or something to the flag
halyard, and they&rsquo;re running it up and down,&rdquo; Jerry
said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to get here, but they <i>have</i>
to tack. Don&rsquo;t you <i>see</i>, Chris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course I saw, but I didn&rsquo;t blame Jerry for being snappy
at the last minute.</p>

<p>The next tack showed very plainly that the boat was really coming
to the Sea Monster, and somebody stood up in the stern and shouted.
We shouted back&mdash;one last howl&mdash;and then stood there
panting, because there was no use in wasting any more breath and our
throats were quite split as it was. When the catboat came a little
nearer we saw that there was only one man in it, and, sure enough,
an old blue jersey was tied to the flag halyard. The man turned the
boat around very neatly&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know the right sailing
word for it&mdash;and anchored. Then he climbed into the dinghy that
was trailing along behind and began rowing to the Sea Monster.</p>

<p>I sat down on the rock and I had to keep swallowing, because I
felt as if my heart were bumping up against my throat. To save time,
before the man landed, Jerry started to shout what had happened.
There wasn&rsquo;t much left of his voice, but he managed to do it
somehow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been here all night,&rdquo; he called huskily.
&ldquo;We came out to explore this thing, and our boat got away, and
our little brother fell off the top and is hurt awfully, and&rdquo;
(this was just as the man climbed ashore on the sea-weedy rocks)
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;d always called this place the &lsquo;Sea
Monster&rsquo; because it looked like one, but now we know it
<i>is</i> one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was looking at us very hard, particularly at me, and he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Sea Monster&rsquo;!&rdquo; Then he looked again
and said &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a nice tall man, with a brown, squarish face, quite thin,
and twinkly blue eyes and a lot of dark hair that blew around like
Jerry&rsquo;s. He looked from one to the other of us and nodded his
head to himself. I suppose we did look very queer,&mdash;quite
dirty, and Jerry with the tin-foil-buckled belt still around him and
no shirt; and my bloomers dangling down like a Turkish
person&rsquo;s because of the elastics having burst when I fell
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; said our man, &ldquo;that I have arrived
in the nick of time to perform a daring rescue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said it in a funny make-believe way, as if he were doing one
of our plays, and then suddenly the twinklyness went out of his eyes
and he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But take me to Gregory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If we hadn&rsquo;t been so perfectly bursting with thankfulness
and so tired of shouting and the cold and the whole hideous place,
we should have wondered how on earth he knew Greg&rsquo;s name,
because neither of us had mentioned it. But we didn&rsquo;t think of
it then, and just snatched his hands and pulled him over the rocks,
trying to tell him a little how glad we were to see him.</p>

<p>When he saw Greg, his face grew quite different&mdash;very sorry,
and not twinkly at all and he went down on his knees (he
couldn&rsquo;t have stood up in the back of the cave) and he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old man!&rdquo; And then, &ldquo;I wonder who had the
worst night of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We said, &ldquo;Greg, of course.&rdquo; But our man said,
&ldquo;I wonder.&rdquo; Then he changed again, and instead of being
all sorry and gentle, he got quite commanding and very quick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chris, you stay here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Gerald, come
with me,&mdash;and here, put this on.&rdquo;</p>


<p>He pulled off his gray flannel coat and tossed it to Jerry, and
Jerry did put it on and ran after him, tucking up the sleeves. I saw
them get into the dinghy and row back to the boat, and I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gregs, we&rsquo;re going home, we&rsquo;re going
home!&rdquo; and we both cried a little.</p>

<p>They came back after what seemed a long time, and our man
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I&rsquo;m fixing Gregory, you and Gerald tackle
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was half a loaf of bread and some potted beef done up in oiled
paper, and I&rsquo;m sure Jerry ate the oiled paper, too. I&rsquo;d
heard of starving people falling on food and rending it savagely,
but I never knew exactly what rending was until we did it to the
bread. We gave some of it to Greg, too, while our man was fixing
him.</p>

<p>I never saw any one before who could do things so fast and so
gently. He had nice, brown, quick hands, and he looked so grown up
and useful. He&rsquo;d brought a roll of bandage stuff&mdash;the
kind with a blue wrapper that you keep in First Aid kits&mdash;and a
book that had &ldquo;Coast Pilot Guide and Harbor Entrances of New
England&rdquo; on the cover. I didn&rsquo;t see what he could want
that for, except on the boat, till he put it under Greg&rsquo;s
armpit and bandaged his arm across it to keep it steady. The white
waistcoat was in our man&rsquo;s way, so he ripped it down the side
and got it off entirely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was an explorer,&rdquo; Greg explained shakily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was Baroo, the Madagascar cabin-boy,&rdquo; Jerry said,
gnawing the loaf, and I thought it seemed years ago that we had
<i>trekked</i> across Wecanicut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said our man, in his nice, kind, reliable
way, and then he said to Greg, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hurt you much,
did I, old fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Greg shook his head, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was what we all felt, but none of us had put it so simply
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; the man said, as he was
gathering up the rest of the bandages.</p>

<p>It was the Simpson-thing, and it did look very funny by daylight,
I must say,&mdash;just a wob of blue flannel tied with a string. I
was going to explain, but Jerry said, with his mouth full:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just something we had,&rdquo; and stuffed it away in
the kit-bag. He was quite red. Boys are funny sometimes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said our man, &ldquo;comes the embarkation,
and I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to hurt you a little,
Greg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He picked Greg up in one swinging swoop, and I wished that Jerry
and I had been strong enough to do that last night. Greg had only
time for one gasp before he was quite comfortable against our
man&rsquo;s shoulder. But he <i>was</i> brave, because it must have
hurt like anything, even then, and I could see his jaw set hard.
Jerry and I gathered up the kit-bag and the jersey and what was left
of the skirt and followed along. Just beside the dinghy our man
paused and looked all around at the ugly blackness of the Sea
Monster and up to the jaggedy top of it. Then he looked down at Greg
and smiled a little sorry smile, and said very slowly and
gently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye be Three Poore Mariners.&rdquo;</p>

<a name="fig4"></a> <div class="figure"><img src="images/image4.png"
alt="&ldquo;Ye be Three Poore Mariners." /></div>


<p>Jerry and I stared at each other, and I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must know that song, too. We used to pretend being
marooned, but we never thought it would really happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Jerry said suddenly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, what&rsquo;s your name, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to row, Jerry,&rdquo; said our man,
&ldquo;because I must keep the wounded just the way he is.&rdquo;
Then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some people call me Andrew, but my intimate friends call
me &lsquo;The Bottle Man&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<div class="text">

<p class="first">I thought that perhaps it might be a dream after
all, because that&rsquo;s the way things happen in dreams, and that
I would wake up and find it still night and the rain splashing down
and poor Greg crying. But the dinghy was real and so were the slippy
slidy wet rocks, and I had to watch what I was about and not go
staring in astonishment at our man. We all had to be careful about
the rocks, and that&rsquo;s why none of us said anything till we
were in the dinghy, except for one gasp of astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how <i>could</i> you be?&rdquo; Jerry and I asked
together when we all were safely aboard, with our man in the stern
holding Greg carefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did you get un-oldened?&rdquo; Greg asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought you were a very old gentleman,&rdquo; I
explained giddily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I am</i>,&rdquo; said the Bottle Man.
&ldquo;Ancient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what about your gray hairs?&rdquo; Jerry demanded,
tugging away at the oars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve more than one gray hair you&rsquo;ve gray
hairs,&rdquo; said our man. &ldquo;I have eleven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ducked down his nice, dark, rumpled-up head for us to look,
but I must say I couldn&rsquo;t see more than one little one all
buried among the black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re grown up, but you&rsquo;re not old at
all,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been imagining you as an aged
old man with a long white beard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never mentioned a long white beard,&rdquo; the Bottle
Man said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but what about your tottering along on two
sticks?&rdquo; Jerry said suddenly.</p>

<p>But we had come alongside the catboat, and no one could talk for
a little while until we were all arranged in the boat and our man
had told Jerry and me to pull a mattressy thing out of the tiny
little cabin and had laid Greg on it in the bottom of the boat. He
gave him some stuff out of a little flasky bottle, too, and Greg
sputtered over it and said &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; but afterward he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice and hot inside when I thought it had
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And we couldn&rsquo;t talk, either, when our man was hoisting the
orange-painted sail and hauling up the anchor and running back and
forth to pull ropes and things. But when he was settled at the
tiller and all of us were cosy with sweaters and coats, Jerry asked
him again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; the Bottle Man said, &ldquo;something
had hit me very hard and for a long time all that I was able to do
was to totter along on the two sticks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what hit you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>He dropped his voice, because Greg was actually asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An inconsiderate shell,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>For a minute, because I was so used to thinking of him on the
lonely island, I imagined a big conch-shell being hurled at him from
somewhere. Then Jerry and I both gasped:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you were in the war?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said our man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the bearded man was a doctor?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he was!&rdquo; the Bottle Man said.</p>

<p>We both asked him questions at once, but he was dreadfully vague,
and kept looking at Greg and the sail and the shore, but we managed
to piece together that he&rsquo;d been wounded twice and left for
dead in No-Man&rsquo;s-Land (after doing all sorts of heroic things,
we know) and finally sent home to America from a French hospital. We
found out, too, that his aunt was the &ldquo;good soul&rdquo; he
talked about in his letters, and that she half-owned the island and
had a beautiful big old house on it where she made him come while he
convalesced. It was very hard to find out all these things, because
he <i>would</i> be so mysterious and kept saying &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
and &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another story!&rdquo; He also wanted to hear
all of our adventures, but we wouldn&rsquo;t tell him those until
we&rsquo;d heard some of his.</p>

<p>Jerry asked him suddenly about the scar where the sea-thing bit
him, or stabbed him, or whatever it did, and our man twinkled and
pulled up his sleeve. And there, just above his right elbow where
the tan stopped, was a little white three-cornered scar, sure
enough. Jerry looked and said &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and our man said
&ldquo;Ah-ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at the end of all the stories we realized that we
didn&rsquo;t know, even now, how he happened to be sailing along
just in time to rescue us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> sailed all the way from Bluar Boor,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;on purpose to see you. To tell the truth, I had designs
on the &lsquo;Sea Monster&rsquo; which will not be carried out now.
I laid up last night inside the Headland breakwater and made an
early start this morning for the last leg of the trip. I recognized
the &lsquo;Sea Monster&rsquo; a long way off, but I must say I was
surprised when I saw Jerry&rsquo;s shirt signaling so distressfully.
Of course I knew who you were at once, when you called the place the
&lsquo;Sea Monster,&rsquo; but Christine did stagger me for a
minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stagger you?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking you were &lsquo;Christopher&rsquo; all
this time, you see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but, being a man of
infinite resource and unparalleled sagacity, I immediately perceived
the true state of affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Are</i> you a professor?&rdquo; Jerry asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens, no!&rdquo; our man laughed. &ldquo;Why do you
ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On account of your style,&rdquo; Jerry said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so grand and stately. So are your letters,
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am but a poor bridge-builder,&rdquo; the Bottle Man
said, &ldquo;but I can turn words on or off as I want &rsquo;em,
like a hose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the boat was almost in, and our man brought it up
neatly to the float beside the ferry-slip, and some men came over
and helped him to moor it. Then he got out and came back in a minute
with the man who always meets the ferry in an automobile to hire.
The man looked as if he were in a dazy dream, which I don&rsquo;t
blame him for at all, because we did look quite weird. He and the
Bottle Man lifted Gregg, mattress and all, and stowed him in on the
back seat of the automobile. The rest of us perched on the front
seat and the running-board, trying to conceal our strange appearance
from the staring of quite a crowd which was gathering, as it was
just ferry-time.</p>

<p>Our man said, &ldquo;17 Luke Street, and go carefully.&rdquo; It
surprised us for a second to hear him say our address as if
he&rsquo;d known it always, but then we realized that he <i>had</i>
known it for quite a long time.</p>

<p>I think none of us will ever forget the way the house looked as
we swung around the corner and came up Luke Street. Just the end of
the gable first, behind the two big beeches in the front
garden,&mdash;oh, we hadn&rsquo;t seen it for years and
centuries,&mdash;and then the living-room windows open, with the
curtains blowing, and the little box-bush that grows in a fat jar on
the porch-steps. Mother was coming out at the front door, and she
looked just the way she did when we got a telegram once saying that
Grannie was very ill. Jerry jumped off the running-board before the
automobile stopped, and he let Mother hug him right there in the
middle of the path, which is a thing he generally hates. By that
time our man and the chauffeur were lifting Greg and the mattress
out, and Mother let go of Jerry and stood quite still, with her face
all white and hollow-looking. We all began talking at once, and the
Bottle Man managed to tell Mother more about everything in a few
minutes than you would think possible.</p>

<p>He and the automobile man, who still looked flabbergasted, put
Greg on the big bed in mother&rsquo;s room while she was telephoning
to Dr. Topham. We all felt fidgetty and unsettled until Dr. Topham
came, which was really very soon. I think he must have broken all
the speed rules. Jerry and I, who had put on some other clothes, sat
in the living-room with the Bottle Man while the doctor set
Greg&rsquo;s arm, which was fractured. Mother stayed with Greg. The
Bottle Man told us things about the war and his island, and he
played soft, wonderful music on the piano to make us forget about
Greg and the Sea Monster and all the awful things that had
happened.</p> </div> <br />

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<div class="text">
<p class="first">It was the queerest topsy-turvy morning I ever
spent. After Mother came down and told us that Gregs was fixed and
that Doctor Topham had given him something to make him sleep, we all
went in and had lots of breakfast.&mdash;Mother and the Bottle Man,
too, for neither of them had had any. You would never have thought
we&rsquo;d eaten the bread and potted beef there on the Monster, if
you&rsquo;d seen the way we devoured the eggs and bacon and honey
and toast that Katy and Lena kept bringing in. They both brought the
things, because they were so glad to see us and so afraid that it
had been their fault that we went to Wecanicut. But we told Mother
that it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>While we ate. Mother told us everything that had happened at
home. She and Father came in on the six o&rsquo;clock train and
found Katy and Lena quite worried because we hadn&rsquo;t come back
yet, but no one got really frightened until later. Father thought of
Wecanicut and went to the ferry to ask, but Captain Lewis
wasn&rsquo;t there, and of course the cross new captain that
we&rsquo;d seen looking at the book hadn&rsquo;t even noticed us and
wouldn&rsquo;t have known us if he had. Our nice Portuguese man
remembered our going over and was perfectly certain that he&rsquo;d
seen us come back, too, which of course he hadn&rsquo;t. So, after
setting the policeman and every one else to search town, Father and
Captain Moss went to Wecanicut on the chance. They reached the point
at a quarter after nine, which was when we saw the lights, and they
never for a moment thought of the Sea Monster, because no one had
missed the old dinghy from the ferry-slip and they didn&rsquo;t
imagine that we could get there. They didn&rsquo;t find any trace of
us at the usual picnic place on Wecanicut, because we had everything
with us, and though some of the Fort soldiers searched, too, nothing
could be found. Father had been up all night and was still out,
telephoning to all sorts of places.</p>

<p>If I deserved any punishment for its being my fault, I think I
had it when I thought of how hard Father had been working and how
wretched and anxious they all were. I hadn&rsquo;t quite realized
that before.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, right after breakfast Jerry and I began to yawn
tremendously, and Mother bundled us off to bed. We hadn&rsquo;t had
time to think of it, but of course we hadn&rsquo;t slept
particularly well on the Sea Monster. Just as we were going
upstairs, Aunt Ailsa came running in with her hat on, crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Katy telling the truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then we both leaped on her from the stairs. When she ducked
her head up from our hugs, the Bottle Man was standing in the
doorway, looking queer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ailsa!&rdquo; he said; and that really did floor us,
because we knew we&rsquo;d never even mentioned her existence to
him. She stood staring, and then put her hand up against her throat,
exactly like somebody in a book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andrew!&rdquo; she said, in a faint little voice.</p>

<p>Mother looked at them, and then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bedtime, chicks! Come along!&rdquo; and went up with
us.</p>

<p>It was quite weird, going to bed at nine o&rsquo;clock in the
morning. We pulled down all the shades so we could sleep, though I
don&rsquo;t really think we needed to, because I know that as soon
as I shut my eyes I was sound asleep.</p>

<p>When I woke up the room was quite dim, and Mother and Father were
standing at the door talking. Father looked awfully tired, but dear
and glad, and he wouldn&rsquo;t let me tell him how sorry I was
about it all. Mother said that even more surprising things had been
happening, and that if I&rsquo;d slept enough for a time, I&rsquo;d
better come down to supper. That was queer, too,&mdash;dressing in
the twilight and coming down to supper, instead of to breakfast.</p>

<p>We all talked a lot at supper, of course, and people kept asking
questions. I had to do most of the answering, because Jerry always
left out the parts about himself, and yet it was he who did all the
wonderful things. We had bottles of ginger-pop, because it was a
sort of feast, and Father got up and proposed toasts, just like a
real banquet. First he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerry! I&rsquo;m glad to have a son with a level
head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christine!&rdquo; and looked at me very hard, till I
wanted to turn away. But they all drank it just the same as
Jerry&rsquo;s, though I didn&rsquo;t deserve it at all. Then Father
held up his glass and said very gently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greg!&rdquo; And when I tried to drink it, the ginger-pop
choked me, and Jerry banged me between the shoulders, which, of
course, only made it worse, because it wasn&rsquo;t that sort of
choke.</p>

<p>Then Jerry jumped up and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to drink to the Bottle Man, <i>I</i> think. And,
by the way, &lsquo;Bottle Man&rsquo; looks all right in a letter,
but it&rsquo;s queer, rather, to say to you. Haven&rsquo;t you
really a real name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our man and Aunt Ailsa looked at each other as if they were going
to say something, and then the Bottle Man twinkled, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very soon you&rsquo;ll be able to call me Uncle
Andrew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This part seems to be nothing but explanations, which are horrid,
but there <i>were</i> lots, and I can&rsquo;t help it. Of course
Jerry and I sat staring in surprise, and there <i>had</i> to be
explanations. And what do you think! Our own Bottle Man was that
&ldquo;Somebody Westland&rdquo; that Aunt Ailsa had wept so about.
The casualty list was perfectly right in saying that he was wounded
and missing (though it came very late, because by that time he was
in America), and she thought, of course, that he was dead, because
she didn&rsquo;t hear from him. And he&rsquo;d written to her from
the French hospital and the letter never came. When he came back,
all sick and wounded, to America, somebody who didn&rsquo;t know
anything about it told him that Aunt Ailsa was going to marry Mr.
Something-or-other, so our poor man went off sadly to his island and
didn&rsquo;t write to her any more. He&rsquo;d never heard of us,
because of course her name isn&rsquo;t Holford. And
<i>she&rsquo;d</i> never heard of his aunt, nor Blue Harbor, nor the
island, so of course she didn&rsquo;t know anything about it when we
read his letters to her. Oh, it was very tangly and bewildering and
it took lots of explaining, but at the end of supper there was just
enough ginger-pop left to drink to both of them.</p>

<p>Afterwards she and Father played the &rsquo;cello and piano,
because we asked them to, and the Bottle Man sat with his arm over
Jerry&rsquo;s shoulders, watching, with the light on his nice,
brown, kind face. And Father sat with his head tucked down over the
&rsquo;cello, just the way I remembered there on the Sea Monster,
and the candles shone on Aunt Ailsa&rsquo;s amberish-colored hair,
and I thought she was the beautifullest person in the world, except
Mother. I thought about a lot of things while the music went on, and
wondered whether we&rsquo;d ever want to picnic on Wecanicut again.
But I knew we would, because Wecanicut is a kind, friendly, safe
place (and we do go there now lots, only we don&rsquo;t look at the
Sea Monster much). I thought, too, that perhaps if we&rsquo;d never
thrown the message in the bottle into the harbor, Aunt Ailsa and
Uncle Andrew would never have been married and lived happily ever
after,&mdash;that is, they&rsquo;ve lived happily so far and I think
they&rsquo;ll keep on. Because if we hadn&rsquo;t, the Bottle Man
would never have come sailing down to see us, and he might still be
thinking Aunt Ailsa had married the Mr. Thingummy, when she
hadn&rsquo;t at all.</p>

<p>He was such a nice Bottle Man! I sat there on the couch and
thought how splendid it would be when he was our own uncle, and I
laughed when I remembered how we&rsquo;d imagined that he was an
ancient old gentleman. The wind began to rise outside. I could hear
it whisking around and bumping in the chimney, and I thought how
glad I was&mdash;<i>oh</i>, how glad, <i>glad</i> I was&mdash;that
we were all at home, and I listened hard to the &rsquo;cello and
tried not to remember the horrible old Sea Monster. </p>

<p>Mother slipped in and sat down beside me, and when the music
ended, she said: &ldquo;Greg wants to see the &lsquo;Bottle
Man&rsquo;.&rdquo; We asked if we might come, too, because we
hadn&rsquo;t seen Greg since they carried him up to the house, all
bloody and rumpled and dirty. So we all went up, and Mother tip-toed
in first with the lamp. He looked almost quite like himself, with
clean pajamas and his hair brushed and all the frightened, hurt look
gone out of his face.</p>


<p>The Bottle Man (I almost forget to call him that, because
we&rsquo;ve been calling him Uncle Andrew for months) leaned over
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots better now, old man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Greg said &ldquo;Lots,&rdquo; and then, &ldquo;But what I
<i>did</i> want to ask you is, how you sailed all the way from the
Mid-Equator to here in such a little boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bottle Man laughed, and then said very soberly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <i>are</i> you sure you measured it right? To-morrow
I&rsquo;ll show you on the map.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We only stayed a minute, and then said good-night and went out. I
was the last one, and just as I was going through the door, Greg
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chris! Come back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I went and sat on the edge of the bed in the dark, and Greg
put his good arm around my neck when I bent down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Chris,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;sometimes that
night I think I thought you were Mother. Oh, Chris, I <i>do</i> love
you awfully much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I was happier then than I&rsquo;d been since&mdash;oh, it
seemed centuries ago.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://gutenberg.net/etext06/">http://gutenberg.net/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
