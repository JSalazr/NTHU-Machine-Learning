    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Let the child imbibe in the full spirit of play. There is
    nothing like it to keep him on the path of health, right
    thinking and mind development."</p>

    <p>That is the guiding purpose of the author. The reader will
    find in this book a collection of old and present day games.
    The student of Play has long realized that there are no new
    games, that all our games of today are built on the old
    timers.</p>

    <p>The purpose of My Book of Indoor Games is to furnish
    amusement, entertainment and to be the means of sociability. So
    very often the question comes up&mdash;"What shall we do?" In
    many cases this book serves only as a reminder, the games and
    parlor tricks are well known but cannot be recalled at the
    critical moment. A combination, such as this, of the best of
    the old-fashioned games and a carefully compiled list of the
    games of today will furnish much help to the young in their
    search of entertainment and amusement.</p>

    <p>But the book will be equally useful to grownups. The author
    has seen staid, respectable people play "Lubin Loo" with as
    much zest and spirit as the youngest group of children. All of
    us have played "Going to Jerusalem." The spirit must be there;
    there is nothing so contagious as the spirit of play.</p>

    <h1>INDOOR GAMES</h1>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Twirl the Trencher</h3>

    <p>This is a game which almost any number of children can
    play.</p>

    <p>The players seat themselves in a circle, and each takes the
    name of some town, or flower, or whatever has been previously
    agreed upon. One of the party stands in the middle of the
    circle, with a small wooden trencher, or waiter, places it upon
    its edge, and spins it, calling out as he does so the name
    which one of the players has taken. The person named must jump
    up and seize the trencher before it ceases spinning, but if he
    is not very quick the trencher will fall to the ground, and he
    must then pay a forfeit. It is then his turn to twirl the
    trencher.</p>

    <p>A very similar game to this is "My Lady's Toilet." The only
    difference is that each player must take the name of some
    article of a lady's dress, such as shawl, earring, brooch,
    bonnet, etc.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Cross Questions and Crooked Answers</h3>

    <p>To play this game it is best to sit in a circle, and until
    the end of the game no one must speak above a
    whisper.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>

    <p>The first player whispers a question to his neighbor, such
    as: "Do you like roses?" This question now belongs to the
    second player, and he must remember it.</p>

    <p>The second player answers: "Yes, they smell so sweetly," and
    this answer belongs to the first player. The second player now
    asks his neighbor a question, taking care to remember the
    answer, as it will belong to him. Perhaps he has asked his
    neighbor, "Are you fond of potatoes?" and the answer may have
    been, "Yes, when they are fried!"</p>

    <p>So that the second player has now a question and an answer
    belonging to him, which he must remember.</p>

    <p>The game goes on until every one has been asked a question
    and given an answer, and each player must be sure and bear in
    mind that it is the question he is asked, and the answer his
    neighbor gives, which belong to him.</p>

    <p>At the end of the game each player gives his question and
    answer aloud, in the following manner:</p>

    <p>"I was asked: 'Do you like roses?' and the answer was: 'Yes,
    when they are fried!'" The next player says: "I was asked: 'Are
    you fond of potatoes?' and the answer was: 'Yes, they are very
    pretty, but they don't wear well.'"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Oranges and Lemons</h3>

    <p>Two of the players join hands, facing each other, having
    agreed privately which is to be "Oranges" and which "Lemons."
    The rest of the party form a long line, standing one behind the
    other, and holding each other's dresses or coats. The first two
    raise their hands so as to form an arch, and the rest run
    through it, singing as they run:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Oranges and Lemons,</p>

            <p>Say the bells of St. Clement's;</p>

            <p>You owe me five farthings,</p>

            <p>Say the bells of St. Martin's;</p>

            <p>When will you pay me?</p>

            <p>Say the bells of Old Bailey.</p>

            <p>I do not
            know,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
               id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>

            <p>Says the big bell of Bow.</p>

            <p>Here comes a chopper to light you to bed!</p>

            <p>Here comes a chopper to chop off your head!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>At the word "head" the hand archway descends, and clasps the
    player passing through at that moment; he is then asked in a
    whisper, "Oranges or Lemons?" and if he chooses "oranges," he
    is told to go behind the player who has agreed to be "oranges"
    and clasp him round the waist.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/13.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/13.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The players must be careful to speak in a whisper, so that
    the others may not know what has been said.</p>

    <p>The game then goes on again, in the same way, until all the
    children have been caught and have chosen which they will be,
    "oranges" or "lemons." When this happens, the two sides prepare
    for a tug-of-war. Each child clasps the one in front of him
    tightly and the two leaders pull with all their might, until
    one side has drawn the other across a line which has been drawn
    between them.</p>
    <hr class="short" />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>

    <h3>Musical Chairs or Going to Jerusalem</h3>

    <p>This game must be played in a room where there is a
    piano.</p>

    <p>Arrange some chairs, back to back, in the center of the
    room, allowing one chair less than the number of players. Some
    one begins to play a tune, and at once the players start to
    walk or run round the chairs, to the sound of the music.</p>

    <p>When the music stops, each player must try to find a seat,
    and as there is one chair short, some one will fail to do so,
    and is called "put." He must carry a chair away with him, and
    the game goes on again until there is only one person left in,
    with no chair to sit upon. This person has won the game.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Traveler's Alphabet</h3>

    <p>The players sit in a row and the first begins by saying, "I
    am going on a journey to Athens," or any place beginning with
    A. The one sitting next asks, "What will you do there?" The
    verbs, adjectives, and nouns used in the reply must all begin
    with A; as "Amuse Ailing Authors with Anecdotes." If the player
    answers correctly, it is the next player's turn; he says
    perhaps: "I am going to Bradford." "What to do there?" "To
    Bring Back Bread and Butter." A third says: "I am going to
    Constantinople." "What to do there?" "To Carry Contented Cats."
    Any one who makes a mistake must pay a forfeit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Family Coach</h3>

    <p>This is a very good old game, and is most amusing if you can
    find some one who is a good story-teller.</p>

    <p>The players sit in a circle and every one, except the
    story-teller, takes the name of some part of a coach or its
    equipments; for instance, door, step, wheels, reins, box-seat,
    and so on.</p>

    <p>When all are ready, the story-teller begins a tale about an
    old coach and what happened to it, how it went on a journey,
    came to grief, was mended, and started off again.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span> The story should be told
       fluently, but not too quickly. Every time any part of the
       coach is mentioned, the player who has taken that name must
       rise from his seat and then sit down again.</p>

    <p>Whenever "the coach" is mentioned, all the players, with the
    exception of the story-teller, must rise. Any one who fails to
    keep these rules must pay a forfeit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Drop the Handkerchief</h3>

    <p>A ring is formed by the players joining hands, whilst one
    child, who is to "drop the handkerchief," is left outside. He
    walks round the ring, touching each one with the handkerchief,
    saying the following words:</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/15.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/15.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"I wrote a letter to my love,</p>

            <p>But on my way, I dropped it;</p>

            <p>A little child picked it up</p>

            <p>And put it in his
            pocket.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
               id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>

            <p>It wasn't you, it wasn't you,</p>

            <p>It wasn't you&mdash;but it was you."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>When he says "It was you," he must drop the handkerchief
    behind one of the players, who picks it up and chases him round
    the ring, outside and under the joined hands, until he can
    touch him with the handkerchief. As soon as this happens, the
    first player joins the ring, whilst it is now the turn of the
    second to "drop the handkerchief."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Magic Music</h3>

    <p>One of the players is sent out of the room, and the rest
    then agree upon some simple task for her to perform, such as
    moving a chair, touching an ornament, or finding some hidden
    object. She is then called in and some one begins to play the
    piano. If the performer plays very loudly, the "seeker" knows
    that she is nowhere near the object she is to search for. When
    the music is soft, then she knows she is very near, and when
    the music ceases altogether, she knows that she has found the
    object she was intended to look for.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Buzz</h3>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/plate2.jpg"><img width="100%"
             src="images/thumb2.jpg"
             alt="Plate 2 (click to view)." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>This is a very old game, but is always a very great
    favorite. The more the players, the greater the fun. The way to
    play it is as follows: The players sit in a circle and begin to
    count in turn, but when the number 7 or any number in which the
    figure 7 or any multiple of 7 is reached, they say "Buzz,"
    instead of whatever the number may be. As, for instance,
    supposing the players have counted up to 12, the next player
    will say "13," the next "Buzz" because 14 is a multiple of 7
    (twice 7)&mdash;the next player would then say "15" the next
    "16," and the next would, of course, say "Buzz" because the
    figure 7 occurs in the number 17. If one of the players forgets
    to say "Buzz" at the proper time, he is out. The game then
    starts over again with the remaining players, and so it
    continues until there is but one person remaining. If great
    care is taken the numbers can be counted up to 70,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span> which, according to the rules
       before mentioned, would, of course, be called Buzz. The
       numbers would then be carried on as Buzz 1, Buzz 2, etc., up
       to 79, but it is very seldom that this stage is reached.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>"I Apprenticed My Son."</h3>

    <p>The best way of describing this game is to give an
    illustration of how it is played. The first player thinks of
    "Artichoke," and commences: "I apprenticed my son to a
    greengrocer, and the first thing he sold was an A."</p>

    <p>Second player: "Apple?" "No."</p>

    <p>Third player: "Almonds?" "No."</p>

    <p>Fourth player: "Asparagus?" "No."</p>

    <p>Fifth player: "Artichoke?" "Yes."</p>

    <p>The last player, having guessed correctly, may now
    apprentice his son. No player is allowed more than one
    guess.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Cat and Mouse</h3>

    <p>The children sit in two rows opposite each other with a
    space between. One child takes the place of "cat," being
    blindfolded, and one takes the place of "mouse," and is also
    blindfolded, the cat standing at one end of the row and the
    mouse at the opposite end. They start in opposite directions,
    guiding themselves by the chairs, the cat trying to catch the
    mouse. When the mouse is caught it is made the cat, and one of
    the company takes the place of the mouse.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Sea King</h3>

    <p>This game can be played by any number of children. They
    proceed by first choosing one of the party to act as the Sea
    King, whose duty it is to stand in the center of a ring, formed
    by the players seating themselves round him. The circle should
    be as large as possible. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span> Each of the players having
       chosen the name of a fish, the King runs round the ring,
       calling them by the names which they have selected.</p>

    <p>Each one, on hearing his name called, rises at once, and
    follows the King, who, when all his subjects have left their
    seats, calls out, "The sea is troubled," and seats himself
    suddenly. His example is immediately followed by his subjects.
    The one who fails to obtain a seat has then to take the place
    of King, and the game is continued.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Buff Says "Baff"</h3>

    <p>This is a game in which no one is allowed to smile or laugh.
    All the players, except one, sit in a row or half circle; one
    goes out of the room and returns with a stick or poker in his
    hand, and a very grave and solemn face. He is supposed to have
    just returned from a visit to Buff. The first player asks him:
    "Where do you come from?" "From Buff." The next asks: "Did he
    say anything to you?" To which the reply is:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Buff said 'Baff,'</p>

            <p>And gave me this staff,</p>

            <p>Telling me neither to smile nor to laugh.</p>

            <p>Buff says 'Baff,' to all his men,</p>

            <p>And I say 'Baff' to you again.</p>

            <p>And he neither laughs nor smiles,</p>

            <p>In spite of all your cunning wiles,</p>

            <p>But carries his face with a very good grace,</p>

            <p>And passes his staff to the very next place."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>If he can repeat all this without laughing, he delivers up
    his staff to some one else, and takes his seat; but if he
    laughs, or even smiles, he pays a forfeit before giving it
    up.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Blind Man's Buff</h3>

    <p>In the olden times this game was known by the name of
    "Hood-man Blind," as in those days the child that was chosen to
    be "blind <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> man" had a hood placed over
       his head, which was fastened at the back of the neck.</p>

    <p>In the present day the game is called "Blind Man's Buff,"
    and very popular it is among young folk.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:75%;">
        <a href="images/19.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/19.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Before beginning to play, the middle of the room should be
    cleared, the chairs placed against the wall, and all toys and
    footstools put out of the way. The child having been selected
    who is to be "Blind Man" or "Buff," is blindfolded. He is then
    asked the question, "How many horses has your father got?" The
    answer is "Three," and to the question: "What color are they?"
    he replies: "Black, white, and gray." All the players then cry:
    "Turn round three times and catch whom you may." Buff
    accordingly spins round and then the fun commences. He tries to
    catch the players, while they in their turn do their utmost to
    escape "Buff," all the time making little sounds to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> attract him. This goes on
       until one of the players is caught, when Buff, without
       having the bandage removed from his eyes, has to guess the
       name of the person he has secured. If the guess is a correct
       one, the player who has been caught takes the part of
       "Buff," and the former "Buff" joins the ranks of the
       players.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Puss in the Corner</h3>

    <p>This game is really for five players only, but, by a little
    arrangement, six or seven children can take part in the
    fun.</p>

    <p>Four players take their places in the different corners of
    the room, while the fifth stands in the middle. If a greater
    number of children wish to play, other parts of the room must
    be named "corners," so that there is a corner for every
    one.</p>

    <p>The fun consists in the players trying to change places
    without being caught; but they are bound to call "Puss, puss,"
    first, and to beckon to the one they wish to change with.
    Directly they leave their corners, the player in the center
    tries to get into one of them.</p>

    <p>When the center player succeeds in getting into a corner,
    the one who has been displaced has to take his place in the
    middle of the room.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Postman</h3>

    <p>For this game all the players, except two, seat themselves
    in a circle. One of the two left out is blindfolded and is
    called the "Postman," the other is called the
    "Postmaster-General." Each of the players seated in the circle
    chooses the name of a town, which the "Post-master-General"
    writes down on a slip of paper, so that he may not forget it.
    He then calls out the names of two towns, thus: "The post from
    Aberdeen to Calcutta." At once, the players who have taken
    those names must change places, and while doing so the
    "Postman" must try to catch one of them. If he succeeds in
    doing so he takes his place in the circle, having chosen a town
    for his name, and the one caught becomes "Postman" in place of
    him. Sometimes "General post" is called, when all have to
    change places, and the "Postman" is then almost sure to gain a
    seat.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"

    <h3>The Dwarf</h3>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/21.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/21.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>This is a most amusing game if well carried out. The two
    performers must be hidden behind two curtains in front of which
    a table has been placed.</p>

    <p>One of the performers slips his hands into a child's socks
    and little shoes. He must then disguise his face, by putting on
    a false mustache, painting his eyebrows, sticking pieces of
    black court plaster over one or two of his teeth, which will
    make it appear as though he has lost several teeth. This, with
    a turban on his head, will prove a very fair disguise. The
    second performer must now stand behind the first and pass his
    arms round him, so that the second performer's hands may appear
    like the hands of the dwarf, while the first performer's hands
    make his feet. The figure must, of course, be carefully
    dressed, and the body of the second performer hidden behind the
    curtains.</p>

    <p>The front player now puts his slippered hands upon the table
    and begins to keep time, while the other performer follows suit
    with his hands.</p>

    <p>The dwarf can be used either to tell fortunes, make jokes,
    or ask riddles, and if the performers act their parts well, the
    guests will laugh very heartily.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>How, When, and Where</h3>

    <p>One of the company goes out of the room, while the others
    choose a word to be guessed, one with two or three different
    meanings being the
    best.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:75%;">
        <a href="images/22.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/22.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>We will suppose that the word "Spring" has been thought of.
    When the person who is outside the room is recalled, he (or
    she) asks each one in succession: "How do you like it?" The
    answers may be "Dry" (meaning the season), "Cold and clear" (a
    spring of water), "Strong" (a watch-spring), and "High" (a
    jump). The next question is: "When do you like it?" The answers
    may be: "When I am in the country," "When I am thirsty," "When
    my watch is broken."</p>

    <p>The next question is: "Where do you like it?" and the
    answers may be: "Anywhere and everywhere," "In hot weather,"
    "In the clock." The game is to try and guess the word after any
    of the answers, and if right, the player last questioned takes
    the place of the one who is guessing; if wrong, the questioner
    must try again.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Old Soldier</h3>

    <p>Old Soldier is a game for young children, and though it
    seems very simple, yet there is a good deal of fun in it. One
    of the children pretends to be an old soldier, and goes round
    begging of each of the other players in turn, saying that he is
    "poor, and old, and hungry,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> and asking what they will do
       for him or give him. In answering the Old Soldier, no one
       must say the words: "Yes," "No," "Black," or "White," and he
       must be answered at once without hesitation. Any one who
       does not reply at once, or who uses any of the forbidden
       words, must pay a forfeit.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:90%;">
        <a href="images/23.png"><img width="100%"

    <hr class="short" />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>

    <h3>Bob Major</h3>

    <p>Two of the players sit down, and a cloth, large enough to
    prevent their seeing anything, is put over their heads. Then
    two other persons tap them on the head with long rolls of
    paper, which they have in their hands, and ask, in feigned
    voices, "Who bobs you?" If either of those who have been tapped
    answers correctly, he changes places with the one who has
    tapped him.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Dumb Crambo</h3>

    <p>Divide the company into two equal parts, one-half leaving
    the room; the remaining players should then select a word,
    which will have to be guessed by those outside the door. When
    the word has been chosen&mdash;say, for instance, the word
    "will"&mdash;the party outside the room are told that the word
    they are to guess rhymes with "till." A consultation then takes
    place, and they may think that the word is "ill." The company
    then enter and begin to act the word "ill," but without
    speaking a word. The audience, when they recognize the word
    that is being performed, will immediately hiss, and the actors
    then retire and think of another word.</p>

    <p>Thus the game goes on until the right word is hit upon, when
    the company who have remained in the room, clap their hands.
    The audience then change places with the actors.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Trades</h3>

    <p>Each player must choose a trade and pretend to be working at
    it. For instance, if he is a tailor, he must pretend to sew or
    iron; if a blacksmith, to hammer, and so on. One is the king,
    and he, too, chooses a trade. Every one works away as hard as
    he can until the king suddenly gives up his trade, and takes up
    that of some one else. Then all must stop, except the one whose
    business the king has taken, and he must start with the king's
    work. The two go on until the king chooses to go back to his
    own trade, when all begin working
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> again. Any one who fails
       either to cease working or to begin again at the right time,
       must pay a forfeit.</p>

    <p>A somewhat more elaborate and livelier game of Trades is
    played by each boy in the party choosing a trade which he is
    supposed to be carrying on. The leader must invent a story,
    and, standing in the middle, must tell it to the company. He
    must manage to bring in a number of names of trades or
    businesses; and whenever a trade is mentioned, the person who
    represents it must instantly name some article sold in the
    shop.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/25.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <h3>The Schoolmaster</h3>

    <p>This is always a favorite game. One of the players is chosen
    schoolmaster, and the others, ranged in order in front of him,
    form the class. The master may then examine the class in any
    branch of learning. Suppose him to choose Geography, he must
    begin with the pupil at the head of the class, and ask for the
    name of a country or town beginning with A. If the pupil does
    not reply correctly before the master has counted ten, he asks
    the next pupil, who, if he answers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span> rightly&mdash;say, for
       instance, "America," or "Amsterdam," in time, goes to the
       top of the class. The schoolmaster may go on in this way
       through the alphabet either regularly or at random, as he
       likes. Any subject&mdash;names of kings, queens, poets,
       soldiers, etc.&mdash;may be chosen. The questions and
       answers must follow as quickly as possible. Whoever fails to
       answer in time, pays a forfeit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Rule of Contrary</h3>

    <p>This is a simple game for little children. It is played
    either with a pocket-handkerchief, or, if more than four want
    to play, with a table-cloth or small sheet. Each person takes
    hold of the cloth; the leader of the game holds it with the
    left hand, while with the right he makes pretense of writing on
    the cloth while he says: "Here we go round by the rule of
    contrary. When I say 'Hold fast,' let go; and when I say 'Let
    go,' hold fast." The leader then calls out one or other of the
    commands, and the rest must do the opposite, of what he says.
    Any one who fails must pay a forfeit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Simon Says</h3>

    <p>Seat yourselves in a circle and choose one of the company to
    be the leader, or Simon. His duty is to order all sorts of
    different things to be done, the funnier the better, which must
    be obeyed only when the order begins with "Simon says." As, for
    instance, "Simon says: 'Thumbs up!'" which, of course, all
    obey; then perhaps comes: "Thumbs down!" which should not be
    obeyed, because the order did not commence with "Simon
    says."</p>

    <p>Each time this rule is forgotten a forfeit must be paid.
    "Hands over eyes," "Stamp the right foot," "Pull the left ear,"
    etc., are the kind of orders to be given.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Bird-Catcher</h3>

    <p>To play this game you must first decide which one of you is
    to be the Bird-catcher; the other players then each choose the
    name of a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> bird, but no one must choose
       the owl, as it is forbidden. All the players then sit in a
       circle with their hands on their knees, except the
       Bird-catcher, who stands in the center, and tells a tale
       about birds, taking care to specially mention the ones he
       knows to have been chosen by the company. As each bird's
       name is called, the owner must imitate its note as well as
       he can, but when the owl is named, all hands must be put
       behind the chairs, and remain there until the next bird's
       name is mentioned. When the Bird-catcher cries "All the
       birds," the players must together give their various
       imitations of birds. Should any player fail to give the cry
       when his bird is named, or forget to put his hands behind
       his chair, he has to change places with Bird-catcher.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>French Roll</h3>

    <p>A good many children may play at this game. One player is
    called the buyer, the rest form a line in front of him and take
    hold of each other. The first in this line is called the baker,
    the last the French roll. Those between are supposed to be the
    oven. When they are all in place the buyer says to the baker,
    "Give me my French roll." The baker replies, "It is at the back
    of the oven." The buyer goes to fetch it, when the French roll
    begins running from the back of the oven, and comes up to the
    baker, calling all the while, "Who runs? Who runs?" The buyer
    may run after him, but if the French roll gets first to the top
    of the line, he becomes baker, and the last in the line is
    French roll. If, however, the buyer catches the French roll,
    the French roll becomes buyer, and the buyer takes the place of
    the baker.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Garden Gate</h3>

    <p>The Garden Gate is a very pretty game. A ring is formed of
    all the players except one, who stands in the middle. The
    others dance round her three times, and when they stop she
    begins to sing:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Open wide the garden gate, the garden gate, the
            garden gate,</p>

            <p>Open wide the garden gate and let me through."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The circle then dances round her again,
    singing:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
       id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Get the key of the garden gate, the garden gate,
            the garden gate,</p>

            <p>Get the key of the garden gate and open and let
            yourself through."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The girl inside the circle, pretending to sob, replies:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"I've lost the key of the garden gate, the garden
            gate, the garden gate,</p>

            <p>I've lost the key of the garden gate, and cannot let
            myself through."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But the dancers dance round and round her, singing:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Then you may stop all night within the gate, within
            the gate, within the gate,</p>

            <p>You may stop all night within the gate, unless you
            have strength to break through."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The captive then rushes to the weakest part of the ring, and
    tries to break through by throwing her whole weight upon the
    clasped hands of the children, and generally contrives to break
    through, the one whose hand gives way being made captive in her
    stead.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>CHARADES</h2>

    <p>A back drawing-room with folding doors makes a very nice
    theater for acting charades. Almost anything may be used for
    dressing up&mdash;shawls, anti-macassars, table-cloths,
    handkerchiefs, cast-off dresses, or a dressing-gown. The latter
    is a very useful garment in representing an old gentleman,
    while tow or white fire shavings make excellent wigs.</p>

    <p>The great thing in a charade is to try and puzzle your
    audience as much as you can. You must choose a word of two or
    more syllables, such as "Bagpipe." First you must act the word
    "Bag," and be sure that the word is mentioned, though you must
    be careful to bring it in in such a way that the audience shall
    not guess it is the word you are acting.</p>

    <p>Next comes the word "Pipe," and this must be brought in in
    the same manner. When you have acted the two syllables, you
    must act the whole: "Bagpipe."</p>

    <p>Before beginning the charade, you should arrange who is to
    bring <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> in the charade word or
       syllable. You must also settle what you are going to say, or
       at least, what the act is to be about. Let every scene be
       well thought out and be as short as possible. You must be as
       quick as ever you can between the acts, for all the fun will
       be spoiled if you keep your audience waiting. If you have no
       curtain or screen, the actors must simply walk off the stage
       at the end of the scenes.</p>

    <p>To act charades well, one requires a little practice and
    plenty of good temper, for, of course, only one or two can take
    principal parts, and therefore some of the children must be
    content to take the smaller ones. It is a good plan to take it
    in turns to play the best parts, and if the elder children are
    kind and thoughtful, they will try to make some easy little
    parts, so that their younger brothers and sisters may also join
    in the fun. Here we give you a very simple charade, the words
    of which you may learn, and then act, after which you will very
    likely be able to make up charades for yourselves.</p>

    <h3>The "Band-Box" Charade</h3>

    <h4>Scene 1: A Street</h4>

    <p>This can be made by placing a row of chairs with open backs
    near the wall facing the audience; a child is stationed behind
    each chair, and, looking through the open back, pretends to be
    looking out of a window.</p>

    <h4>BAND</h4>

    <p>First Child behind chair.&mdash;Oh! dear, how dull our
    street always is. I declare nothing nice ever comes this
    way.</p>

    <p>Second Child.&mdash;No, I quite agree with you. Why, I
    haven't seen a "Punch and Judy" for months. I wish my mother
    would go and live in another street.</p>

    <p>Third Child.&mdash;Never mind, let us go out and have a
    game.</p>

    <p>(Enter five or six children&mdash;or a lesser number, if
    more convenient&mdash;carrying toy musical instruments.)</p>

    <p>First Child.&mdash;Hurrah! Here comes a German band. Come
    along, children; let's go and listen to
    it.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
       id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>

    <p>(The band groups itself at the end of the street, and the
    children stand round. After tuning up, the band begins to
    play.)</p>

    <p>Second Child.&mdash;Now, Mary Jane, we can dance. I'll dance
    with you.</p>

    <p>Third Child.&mdash;No, I want to dance with Mary Jane.</p>

    <p>First Child.&mdash;I don't want to dance at all.</p>

    <p>Second Child.&mdash;You must.</p>

    <p>Third Child.&mdash;Yes, you must.</p>

    <p>(Band ceases playing and one of the bandsmen comes round for
    money.)</p>

    <p>First Child.&mdash;I haven't any money.</p>

    <p>Second Child.&mdash;But we haven't begun to dance yet.</p>

    <p>Bandsman.&mdash;You shouldn't have been so long arguing
    then. Surely you'll give the band a nickel, after all the
    pretty music it has played?</p>

    <p>First Child.&mdash;I won't.</p>

    <p>Second Child.&mdash;I won't.</p>

    <p>Third Child.&mdash;And I won't.</p>

    <p>Bandsman.&mdash;Well, you are mean. Come along. (Beckoning
    to the rest of the band.) We'll go, and it will be a long time
    before we come down this street again.</p>

    <p>Papa.&mdash;What's the matter, Tommy?</p>

    <p>Tommy.&mdash;Uncle Dick has written to say he is coming to

    box.</p>

    <p>Mamma.&mdash;How kind of him! But be sure you are careful
    not to offend him, Tommy. He is rather a touchy old
    gentleman.</p>

    <p>Sister.&mdash;I wonder what it will be, Tommy.</p>

    <p>Brother.&mdash;I hope it will be a set of cricket things,

    <p>Tommy.&mdash;Oh! yes, I hope it will be, but whatever it is,
    it is sure to be something nice.</p>

    <p>(Begins hopping about again. Enter Uncle Dick, a very old
    gentleman with a gouty foot. Tommy does not see him and goes
    banging into him, treading on his gouty foot.)</p>

    <p>Uncle Dick.&mdash;Oh! oh! oh! oh, my toe!</p>

    <p>Tommy.&mdash;Oh! Never mind your toe! Where's my Christmas
    box?</p>

    <p>Uncle Dick.&mdash;Your Christmas box, you young scamp! Think
    of my toe.</p>

    <p>Tommy.&mdash;Please, uncle, I'm very sorry, but I do so want
    to know what you have brought me for a Christmas box.</p>

    <p>Uncle Dick (roaring).&mdash;Here's your Christmas box, and
    may it teach you to be more careful in future. (Boxes Tommy's
    ears.)</p>

    <p>To make your charades a real success, you will, of course,
    require a curtain. A very effective one can be made with a
    little trouble and at a small cost; indeed, the materials may
    be already in the house.</p>

    <p>First you must fix a couple of supports on each side of the
    room, taking care that they are screwed firmly into the wall,
    and also taking care not to damage the paper.</p>

    <p>If you are a neat workman, you will find on taking out the
    screws that the two small screw-holes on each side will
    scarcely be noticed, as of course the supports must be fixed
    near the ceiling.</p>

    <p>You must then put up your curtain-pole, which should be as
    thin as possible, so that the rings may run easily. A cheap
    bamboo pole is the
    best.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>

    <p>Two wide, deep curtains are required; very likely the
    nursery curtains may be suitable.</p>

    <p>On to these curtains you sew a number of small brass rings,
    which you can buy for about 20 cents a dozen, or even less. The
    rings should be sewn on the curtains, as you see in the
    illustration, right across the top, and from the extreme top
    corner of the curtain, slantingwise across to the middle.</p>

    <p>The top rings are passed along the curtain-pole, a string
    (marked in the illustration A1) is sewn on to the curtain, and
    threaded through the rings until it reaches A2. It is then
    threaded through the rings on the pole until it reaches A3,
    when it is allowed to fall loose.</p>

    <p>The same arrangement is gone through with string B. The
    bottom of the curtain must be weighted with shot, or any other
    weights that may be convenient.</p>

    <p>When the curtain is to be raised, the stage manager and his
    assistant stand on each side of the stage with the strings
    ready in their hands, and at a given signal&mdash;the ringing
    of a bell is the usual sign that all is ready&mdash;they each
    pull a string, and the curtains glide to each side, and may be
    fixed to hooks, put up on purpose.</p>

    <p>When the curtain is to fall, the two in charge of it must
    simply loosen the strings and let them go, and the weights
    cause the curtains to fall to the center.</p>

    <p>All sorts of useful and ornamental "properties" may be made
    at home for a very small cost. Cardboard, and gold and silver
    paper, and glue go a long way toward making a good show.</p>

    <p>Swords, crowns, belts, gold-spangled and gold-bordered robes
    can be made from these useful materials, and look first-rate at
    a distance.</p>

    <p>An old black dress with little gold stars glued or gummed to
    the material would make an excellent dress for a queen. The
    swords or belts must first be cut out in cardboard, then
    covered with gold or silver paper.</p>

    <p>To make a good wig, you should shape a piece of calico to
    fit the head; then sew fire shavings or tow all over it. If you
    wish for a curly wig, it is a good plan to wind the shavings or
    tow tightly round a ruler, and tack it along with a back
    stitch, which will hold the curl in position after you have
    slipped it off the ruler.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"
       id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span> These few hints will give you
       some idea of the very many different costumes which can be
       made by children out of the simplest materials.</p>

    <h3>The Game of Cat</h3>

    <p>The person who is to play the part of Cat should stand
    outside the door of the room where the company is assembled.
    The boys and girls, in turn, come to the other side of the door
    and call out "miaou." If the Cat outside recognizes a friend by
    the cry, and calls out her name correctly in return, he is
    allowed to enter the room and embrace her, and the latter then
    takes the place of Cat. If, on the contrary, the Cat cannot
    recognize the voice, he is hissed, and remains outside until he
    does.</p>

    <h3>Living Pictures</h3>

    <p>Living pictures are very amusing if well carried out, and
    even with little preparation may be made very pretty or very
    comical, whichever may be desired. It is perhaps better to
    attempt comical ones if you have not much time in which to
    arrange them, as the costumes are generally easier to manage,
    and if you are obliged to use garments not quite in keeping
    with the characters, it does not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span> matter much; indeed, it will
       probably only make the audience laugh a little more.</p>

    <p>The great thing in living pictures is to remain perfectly
    still during the performance. You should select several
    well-known scenes either from history or fiction, and then
    arrange the actors to represent the scenes as nearly as
    possible.</p>

    <p>Simple home living pictures are a great source of fun, and
    many a wet afternoon will pass like magic while arranging
    scenes and making dresses to wear. Newspaper masks, newspaper
    cocked hats, old shawls, dressing-gowns, and sticks are quite
    sufficient for home charades.</p>

    <p>Suppose, for instance, you think of "Cinderella" for one
    tableau. One girl could be standing decked out with colored
    tissue paper over her frock, and with paper flowers in her
    hair, to represent one of the proud sisters, while Cinderella
    in a torn frock is arranging the other proud sister's train,
    which may consist of an old shawl. Bouquets of paper flowers
    should be in the sister's hands.</p>

    <p>"Little Red Riding Hood" is another favorite subject for a
    living picture. The wolf may be represented by a boy on his
    hands and knees, with a fur rug thrown over him. Red Riding
    Hood only requires a scarlet shawl, arranged as a hood and
    cloak, over her ordinary frock and pinafore, and she should
    carry a bunch of flowers and a basket.</p>

    <p>All living pictures look better if you can have a frame for
    them. It is not very difficult to make one, especially if you
    have four large card-board dress-boxes.</p>

    <p>Having carefully cut out the bottoms of the boxes, place the
    frames as here shown:</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:60%;">
        <a href="images/35.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/35.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>

    <p>Cut out the center framework, leaving a large square,
    so:</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:60%;">
        <a href="images/36.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/36.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>You must then fasten the four pieces together by gluing
    cardboard on each side of the joints, and you will have a very
    good frame, which you can cover with colored paper or ornament
    with muslin.</p>

    <p>This frame will last a very long time if carefully treated.
    It should stand upright by itself; but if it is a little
    unsteady, it is better to hold it upright from the sides. Of
    course, this will only make a very small frame, but you can
    increase the size by using more boxes.</p>

    <p>If you have no time to make a frame, arrange your figures
    close to a door, outside the room in which the audience is
    seated.</p>

    <p>When quite ready, some one must open the door, when the
    doorway will make a kind of frame to the living picture.</p>

    <p>It is always well to have a curtain if you can; a sheet
    makes an excellent one. Two children standing upon chairs hold
    it up on each side, and at a given signal drop it upon the
    floor, so that, instead of the curtain rising, it drops. When
    it has been dropped, the two little people should take the
    sheet corners in their hands again, so that they have only to
    jump upon the chairs when it is time to hide the picture.</p>

    <p>Of course, these instructions are only for living pictures
    on a very small scale; much grander arrangements will be needed
    if the performance is to take place before any but a "home
    audience."</p>

    <p>As I told you before, comic living pictures are the easiest
    to perform on account of the dresses being easier to make, but
    there are other living pictures which are easier still, and
    which will cause a great deal of fun and merriment. They are
    really catches, and are so simple that even very little
    children can manage them.</p>

    <p>You can arrange a program, and make half a dozen copies to
    hand round to the
    audience.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
       id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>

    <p>The first living picture on the list is "The Fall of Greece"
    and sounds very grand, indeed; but when the curtain rises (or
    rather, if it is the sheet curtain, drops), the audience see a
    lighted candle set rather crookedly in a candlestick and fanned
    from the background so as to cause the grease to fall.</p>

    <p>Here are some other similar comic tableaux which you can
    easily place before an audience:</p>

    <p>"Meet of the Hounds."&mdash;A pile of dog biscuits.</p>

    <p>"View of the Black Sea."&mdash;A large capital C blackened
    with ink.</p>

    <p>"The Charge of the Light Brigade."&mdash;Half a dozen boxes
    of matches labeled: "10 cents the lot."</p>

    <p>These are only a few of the many comic living pictures you
    can perform; but, no doubt, you will be able to think of others
    for yourselves.</p>

    <h3>Acting Proverbs</h3>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:18%;">
        <a href="images/37.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/37.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The best way to play this game is for the players to divide
    themselves into two groups, namely, actors and audience. Each
    one of the actors should then fix upon a proverb, which he will
    act, in turn, before the audience. As, for instance, supposing
    one of the players to have chosen the proverb, "A bad workman
    quarrels with his tools," he should go into the room where the
    audience is seated, carrying with him a bag in which there is a
    saw, a hammer, or any other implement or tool used by a
    workman; he should then look round and find a chair, or some
    other article, which he should pretend requires repairing; he
    should then act the workman, by taking off his coat, rolling up
    his sleeves, and commencing work, often dropping his tools, and
    grumbling about them the whole of the time.</p>

    <p>If this game be acted well, it may be made very
    entertaining. Sometimes the audience are made to pay a forfeit
    each time they fail to guess the proverb.</p>
    <hr class="short" />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
       id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>

    <h3>Shouting Proverbs</h3>

    <p>This is rather a noisy game. One of the company goes outside
    the door, and during his absence a proverb is chosen and a word
    of it is given to each member of the company. When the player
    who is outside re-enters the room, one of the company counts
    "One, two, three," then all the company simultaneously shout
    out the word that has been given to him or her of the proverb
    that has been chosen.</p>

    <p>If there are more players present than there are words in
    the proverb, two or three of them must have the same word. The
    effect of all the company shouting out together is very funny.
    All that is necessary is for the guesser to have a sharp ear;
    then he is pretty sure to catch a word here and there that will
    give him the key to the proverb.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Proverbs</h3>

    <p>This is a very interesting game, and can be played by a
    large number at the same time. Supposing there are twelve
    persons present, one is sent out of the room, while the others
    choose a proverb. When this is done, the "guesser" is allowed
    to come in, and he asks each person a question separately. In
    the answer, no matter what question is asked, one word of the
    proverb must be given. For illustration we will take "A bird in
    the hand is worth two in the bush."</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>1. John must use the word "A" in his answer.</p>

            <p>2. Gladys must use the word "bird" in hers.</p>

            <p>3. Nellie must use the word "in" in hers.</p>

            <p>4. Tommy must use the word "the" in his.</p>

            <p>5. Estelle must use the word "hand" in hers.</p>

            <p>6. Ivy must use the word "is" in hers.</p>

            <p>7. Wilfrid must use the word "worth" in his.</p>

            <p>8. Lionel must use the word "two" in his.</p>

            <p>9. Vera must use the word "in" in hers.</p>

            <p>10. Bertie must use the word "the" in his.</p>

            <p>11. Harold must use the word "bush" in his.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The fun becomes greater if the answers are given quickly and
    without allowing the special word to be noticed. It often
    happens that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> the "guesser" has to try his
       powers over several times before succeeding. The one who by
       giving a bad answer gives the clue, in turn becomes guesser,
       and is then obliged to go out of the room while another
       proverb is chosen.</p>

    <p>Here is a list of proverbs:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">

    <h3>The Adventurers</h3>

    <p>This is a very good game and will combine both instruction
    and amusement. The idea is that the company imagines itself to
    be a party of travelers who are about to set out on a journey
    to foreign countries. A good knowledge of geography is
    required, also an idea of the manufactures and customs of the
    foreign parts about to be visited. It would be as well, if not
    quite certain about the location of the part, to refer to a
    map.</p>

    <p>A place for starting having been decided upon, the first
    player sets out upon his journey. He tells the company what
    spot he intends to visit (in imagination) and what kind of
    conveyance he means to travel in. On arriving at his
    destination, the player states what he wishes to buy, and to
    whom he intends to make a present of his purchase on returning
    home.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"
       id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>

    <p>This may seem very simple, but it is not nearly so easy as
    it appears. The player must have some knowledge of the country
    to which he is going, the way he will travel, and the time it
    will take to complete the journey. To give an instance, it will
    not do for the player to state that he is going to Greenland to
    purchase pineapples, or to Florida to get furs; nor will it do
    for him to make a present of a meerschaum pipe to a lady, or a
    cashmere shawl to a gentleman.</p>

    <p>More fun is added to this game if forfeits are exacted for
    all mistakes.</p>

    <p>The game continues, and the second player must make his
    starting point from where the first leaves off. Of course, all
    depends upon the imagination or the experience of the player;
    if he has been a traveler or has read a good deal, his
    descriptions should be very interesting.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Postman's Knock</h3>

    <p>One player begins the game by going out of the room, and
    then giving a double (or postman's) knock at the door; it is
    the duty of one of the other players to stand at the door
    inside the room to answer the knocks that are made, and to ask
    the postman for whom he has a letter. The postman names some
    member of the company, generally of the opposite sex; he is
    then asked, "How many cents are to be paid?" Perhaps he will
    say "six"; the person for whom the letter is supposed to be
    must then pay for it with kisses, instead of cents; after which
    he or she must take a turn as postman.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>"Our Old Grannie Doesn't Like Tea."</h3>

    <p>All the players sit in a row, except one, who sits in front
    of them and says to each one in turn: "Our old Grannie doesn't
    like T; what can you give her instead?"</p>

    <p>Perhaps the first player will answer, "Cocoa," and that will
    be correct; but if the second player should say, "Chocolate,"
    he will have to pay a forfeit, because there is a "T" in
    chocolate. This is really a catch, as at first every one thinks
    that "tea" is meant instead of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> letter "T." Even after the
       trick has been found out it is very easy to make a slip, as
       the players must answer before "five" is counted; if they
       cannot, or if they mention an article of food with the
       letter "T" in it, they must pay a forfeit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>"I Love My Love with an A."</h3>

    <p>To play this game it is best for the players to arrange
    themselves in a half circle round the room. Then one begins: "I
    love my love with an 'A,' because she is affectionate; I hate
    her with an 'A,' because she is artful. Her name is Alice, she
    comes from Alabama, and I gave her an apricot." The next player
    says: "I love my love with a 'B,' because she is bonnie; I hate
    her with a 'B,' because she is boastful. Her name is Bertha,
    she comes from Boston, and I gave her a book." The next player
    takes "C," and the next "D," and so on through all the letters
    of the alphabet.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Consequences</h3>

    <p>One of the most popular games at a party is certainly
    "Consequences;" it is a very old favorite, but has lost none of
    its charms with age. The players sit in a circle; each person
    is provided with a half sheet of notepaper and a pencil, and is
    asked to write on the top&mdash;(1) one or more adjectives,
    then to fold the paper over, so that what has been written
    cannot be seen. Every player has to pass his or her paper on to
    the right-hand neighbor, and all have then to write on the top
    of the paper which has been passed by the left-hand neighbor
    (2) "the name of the gentleman;" after having done this, the
    paper must again be folded and passed on as before; this time
    must be written (3) one or more adjectives; then (4) a lady's
    name; next (5), where they met; next (6), what he gave her;
    next (7), what he said to her; next (8), what she said to him;
    next (9), the consequence; and lastly (10), what the world said
    about it.</p>

    <p>Be careful that every time anything has been written, the
    paper is folded down and passed on to the player on your right.
    When every one has written what the world says, the papers are
    collected <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> and one of the company
       proceeds to read out the various papers, and the result may
       be something like this:</p>

    <p>(1) The horrifying and delightful (2) Mr. Brown (3) met the
    charming (4) Miss Philips (5) in Lincoln Park; (6) he gave her
    a flower (7) and said to her: "How's your mother?" (8) She said
    to him: "Not for Joseph;" (9) the consequence was they danced
    the hornpipe, and the world said (10), "Just what we
    expected."</p>

    <h3>Earth, Air, Fire, and Water</h3>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:35%;">
        <a href="images/44.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/44.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>To play this game seat yourselves in a circle, take a clean
    duster or handkerchief, and tie it in a big knot, so that it
    may easily be thrown from one player to another. One of the
    players throws it to another, at the same time calling out
    either of these names: Earth, Air, Fire, or Water. If "Earth"
    is called, the player to whom the ball is thrown has to mention
    something that lives on the earth, as lion, cat; if "Air" is
    called, something that lives in the air; if "Water," something
    that lives in the water; but if "Fire" is called, the player
    must keep silence. Always remember not to put birds in the
    water, or animals or fishes in the air; be silent when "Fire"
    is called, and answer before ten can be counted. For breaking
    any of these rules a forfeit must be paid.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Crambo</h3>

    <p>One of the party leaves the room, and on his return he is
    asked to find a word which has been chosen by the other players
    in his absence; and in order to help him, another word is
    mentioned rhyming with the word to be guessed. Questions may
    then be asked by the guesser, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> the players must all
       introduce, as the final word of their answer, another word
       rhyming with the word chosen. For instance, suppose the word
       "way" is selected. The guesser would then be told that the
       word chosen rhymes with "say." He might then ask the first
       one of the party: "What do you think of the weather?" and
       the answer might be: "We have had a lovely day." The second
       question might be: "Have you enjoyed yourself?" and the
       answer might be: "Yes; I have had lots of play." The game
       would proceed in this way until the guesser gave the correct
       answer, or one of the party failed to give the proper rhyme,
       in which case the latter would then be called upon to take
       the place of the guesser.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Lost and Found</h3>

    <p>A very similar game to "Consequences" is that of "Lost and
    Found," which is played in an exactly similar manner, but the
    questions are quite different: (1) Lost, (2) by whom, (3) at
    what time, (4) where, (5) found by, (6) in what condition, (7)
    what time, (8) the reward.</p>

    <p>The answers may be something like the following: (1) Lost a
    postage-stamp, (2) by sister Jane, (3) at three in the morning,
    (4) at St. Louis, (5) it was found by a policeman, (6) rather
    the worse for wear, (7) at dinner-time; (8) the reward was a
    kiss.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>"Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral?"</h3>

    <p>This is a capital game for a large party, for it is both
    instructive and amusing. Two sides are picked, one has to guess
    what word or sentence the remainder of the company has chosen.
    They go out of the room, and when the subject has been decided
    upon, return and ask a question of each of the other side in
    turn. The answer must be either "Yes" or "No," and in no case
    should more words be used, under penalty of paying a forfeit.
    The first important point to be found out is whether the
    subject is "Animal," "Vegetable," or "Mineral." Supposing, for
    instance, the subject chosen is a cat which is sleeping in the
    room by the fire, the questions and answers might be like the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span> following: "Is the subject
       chosen an animal?" "Yes." "Wild animal?" "No." "Domestic
       animal?" "Yes." "Common?" "Yes." "Are there many to be seen
       in this town?" "Yes." "Have you seen many this day?" "Yes."
       "In this house?" "No." "Have you seen many in the road?"
       "Yes." "Do they draw carts?" "No." "Are they used for
       working purposes?" "No." "Is the subject a pet?" "Yes."
       "Have they one in the house?" "Yes." "In this room?" "Yes."
       "Is it lying in front of the fire at the present time?"
       "Yes." "Is the subject you all thought of the cat lying in
       front of the fire in this room?" "Yes." The subject having
       been guessed, another one is chosen and the game proceeds.
       The questions are limited to twenty, but it is hardly ever
       necessary to use that number.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The players seat themselves in a circle on the floor, having
    chosen one of their number to remain outside the circle. The
    children seated on the floor are supposed to be cobblers, and
    the one outside is the customer who has brought his shoe to be
    mended. He hands it to one of them, saying:</p>

    <p>"Cobbler, cobbler, mend my shoe; Get it done by half-past
    two."</p>

    <p>The cobblers pass the shoe round to each other as quickly as
    they can, taking care that the customer does not see which of
    them has it. When the customer comes to fetch it he is told
    that it is not ready. He pretends to get angry and says he will
    take it <span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"
       id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span> as it is. He must then try to
       find it, and the cobbler who has it must try to pass it to
       his neighbor without its being seen by the customer. The
       person upon whom the shoe is found must become the customer,
       while the customer takes his place in the circle on the
       floor.</p>

    <h3>Flying</h3>

    <p>This game requires for the leader a person who can tell a
    story or make a little amusing speech. Each one who plays must
    place the right hand upon the left arm. The leader then tells a
    story, during the telling of which whenever he mentions any
    creature that can fly, every right hand is to be raised and
    fluttered in the air to imitate the action of flying. At the
    name of a creature that does not fly, the hands must be kept
    quiet, under pain of a forfeit. Thus:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The little wren is very small,</p>

            <p class="i2">The humming-bee is less;</p>

    <h3>The Blind Man's Wand</h3>

    <p>This is another way of playing Blind Man's Buff, and is
    thought by many to be an improvement on that game.</p>

    <p>The player who is blindfolded stands in the center of the
    room, with a long paper wand, which can be made of a newspaper
    folded up lengthways, and tied at each end with string. The
    other players then join hands and stand round him in a circle.
    Some one then plays a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
       id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> merry tune on the piano, and
       the players dance round and round the blind man, until
       suddenly the music stops; the blind man then takes the
       opportunity of lowering his wand upon one of the circle, and
       the player upon whom it has fallen has to take hold of it.
       The blind man then makes a noise, such as, for instance, the
       barking of a dog, a street cry, or anything he thinks will
       cause the player he has caught to betray himself, as the
       captive must imitate whatever noise the blind man likes to
       make. Should the blind man detect who holds the stick, the
       one who is caught has to be blind man; if not, the game goes
       on until he succeeds.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Judge and Jury</h3>

    <p>The company should be seated in two lines facing each other,
    and one of the party should then be elected to act as judge.
    Each person has to remember who is sitting exactly opposite,
    because when the judge asks a question of any one, it is not
    the person directly asked who has to reply, but the person
    opposite to the judge. For instance, if the judge, addressing
    one of the company, asks: "Do you like apples?" the person
    spoken to must remain silent, while the person who is opposite
    to him must reply before the judge can count ten; the penalty
    on failing to do this is a forfeit. A rule with regard to the
    answers is that the reply must not be less than two words in
    length, and must not contain the words: "Yes," "No," "Black,"
    "White," or "Gray." For the breaking of this rule a forfeit may
    also be claimed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>"Hands Up!"</h3>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/plate3.jpg"><img width="100%"
             src="images/thumb3.jpg"
             alt="Plate 3 (click to view)." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The company in this game must divide, one-half taking seats
    on one side of the table, and the other half on the other side;
    the players on one side being called the "guessers" and the
    players on the other side being called the "hiders." A button
    or any small object is produced, and the hiders have to pass it
    from hand to hand, under the table, so that those sitting
    opposite may not know who holds it. When it is hidden, one of
    the guessers cries out, "Hands up!" Immediately the hiders must
    place their closed hands on the table; the guessers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> have then to find out which
       hand holds the button. If successful, the hiders take their
       turn at guessing. The person in whose hand the button is
       found must pay a forfeit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Lodgings to Let</h3>

    <p>The company sit in a circle, and a player stands in the
    center. There is one spare chair, and the game is for this
    player to get possession of a vacant seat. When the game
    begins, every one moves as quickly as possible to the chair
    next beside him or her, and as this is done all the time, it is
    difficult for the person who is looking for "lodgings" to find
    a place by slipping in among them, and his attempts will cause
    much amusement.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Hunt the Ring</h3>

    <p>For this game a long piece of string is required. On this a
    ring is threaded, and the ends of the string are knotted
    together. The players then take the string in their hands and
    form a circle, while one of the company, who is called the
    hunter, stands in the center. The string must be passed rapidly
    round and round, and the players must try to prevent the hunter
    finding out who holds the ring. As soon as he has done this, he
    takes his place in the circle, while the person who held the
    ring becomes the "hunter."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Stool of Repentance</h3>

    <p>The players sit in a circle, in the center of which a stool
    is placed. One of the company goes out of the room, and the
    rest say all sorts of things about him. For instance, one will
    say he is handsome, another that he is clever, or stupid, or
    vain. The "culprit" is then called back into the room and seats
    himself on the stool, which is called "the stool of
    repentance," and one of the players begins to tell him the
    different charges which have been made against him. "Some one
    said you were vain; can you guess who it was?" If the culprit
    guesses correctly, he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"
       id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span> takes his seat in the circle
       and the person who made the accusation becomes the "culprit"
       in his stead. If, however, the "culprit" is unable to guess
       correctly, he must go out of the room again while fresh
       charges are made against him.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Feather</h3>

    <p>Having procured a small flossy feather, the players sit in a
    circle as closely together as possible. One of the party then
    throws the feather as high as possible into the air, and it is
    the duty of all the players to prevent it from alighting on
    them, by blowing at it whenever it comes in their direction.
    Any player whom it falls upon must pay a forfeit.</p>

    <p>It is almost impossible to imagine the excitement that is
    produced by this game when it is played with spirit, and the
    fun is not altogether confined to the players, as it gives
    almost as much enjoyment to those who are looking on.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Game of Conversation</h3>

    <p>To play this game successfully, two of the company privately
    agree upon a word that has several meanings. The two then enter
    into a conversation which is obliged to be about the word they
    have chosen, while the remainder of the company listen. When a
    member of the party imagines that he has guessed the word, he
    may join in the conversation, but if he finds he is mistaken,
    must immediately retire.</p>

    <p>To give an illustration: Supposing the two players who start
    the conversation decide upon the word "box." They might talk
    about the people they had seen at the theater and the
    particular part of the house in which they were sitting. Then
    they might say how nice it looked in a garden, and one might
    mention that it grew into big trees. Perhaps one of the company
    might imagine that he had guessed the word correctly and join
    in, when the conversation would be immediately changed, and the
    two would begin to converse about a huge case in which a very
    great number of things were packed away. By
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
       id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span> this time, possibly the
       person who joined in the conversation will leave off,
       completely mystified. If, however, the word should be
       correctly guessed, the person guessing it chooses a partner,
       and they together select a word, and the game begins
       again.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Gallery of Statues</h3>

    <p>For this game all the company leave the room with the
    exception of two. One of these then stands like a statue, with
    perhaps the assistance of a tablecloth or something similar as
    drapery, while the other acts as showman.</p>

    <p>When the position is decided upon, one of the company is
    called in and taken on one side by the showman, and is asked
    his or her opinion as to the merits of the statue. It is almost
    certain that some suggestion will be made; in that case he or
    she is made to assume the attitude suggested, and another
    player is called in, to whom the same question is put, and
    another suggestion made and adopted. As each statue is added to
    the gallery, a great deal of merriment is caused, and in a
    short time a large collection will be obtained.</p>

    <h3>The Huntsman</h3>

    <p>One person represents the huntsman, the other players call
    themselves after some part of the huntsman's belongings; for
    instance, one is the cap, another the horn, others the
    powder-flask, gun, whip, etc.</p>

    <p>A number of chairs are arranged in the middle of the room,
    and there must be one chair less than the number of players,
    not counting the huntsman.</p>

    <p>The players then seat themselves round the room, while the
    huntsman stands in the center and calls for them one at a time,
    in this way: "Powder-flask!" At once "Powder-flask" rises and
    takes hold of the huntsman's coat.</p>

    <p>"Cap," "Gun," "Shot," "Belt," the huntsman cries; each
    person who represents these articles must rise and take hold of
    the player summoned before him, until at length the huntsman
    has a long line behind him. He then begins to run round the
    chairs, until he suddenly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
       id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> cries: "Bang!" when the
       players must sit down. Of course, as there are not
       sufficient chairs, one player will be left standing and he
       must pay a forfeit. The huntsman is not changed throughout
       the game, unless he grows tired, when he may change places
       with one of the others.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Hot Boiled Beans and Bacon</h3>

    <p>This is a game for young children. Some small article is
    hidden in the room, while the little one who has to find it is
    sent outside. This finished, the players call out together:
    "Hot Boiled Beans and Bacon; it's hidden and can be taken." The
    little one enters and begins to hunt about for the hidden
    article. When she comes near to its hiding-place, the company
    tell her that she is getting "hot"; or, if she is not near it,
    she is told that she is "cold." That she is "very hot" or "very
    cold," will denote that she is very near of very far away from
    the object that is hidden; while if she is extremely near, she
    would be told that she was "burning." In this way the hidden
    object can be found, and all the children can be interested in
    the game by being allowed to call out whether the little one is
    "hot" or "cold."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>"My Master Bids You Do as I Do."</h3>

    <p>For all those children who are fond of a little exercise, no
    better game than this can be chosen. When the chairs are placed
    in order round the room, the first player commences by saying:
    "My master bids you do as I do," at the same time working away
    with the right hand as if hammering at his knees. The second
    player then asks: "What does he bid me do?" in answer to which
    the first player says: "To work with one as I do." The second
    player, working in the same manner, must turn to his left-hand
    neighbor and carry on the same conversation, and so on until
    every one is working away with the right hand.</p>

    <p>The second time of going round, the order is to work with
    two, then both hands must work; then with three, then both
    hands and one leg must work; then with four, when both hands
    and both legs must <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> work; lastly with five, when
       both legs, both arms, and the head must be kept going.
       Should any of the players fail in keeping in constant
       motion, a forfeit may be claimed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Red Cap and Blue Cap</h3>

    <p>The players seat themselves in a circle to represent tailors
    at work on a piece of cloth&mdash;a handkerchief or a duster
    will answer the purpose. A leader or foreman is chosen, and
    every one of the company is named in turn Red Cap, Blue Cap,
    Black Cap, Yellow Cap, Brown Cap, etc. The leader then takes
    the piece of cloth and pretends to examine the work which is
    supposed to have been done by the workmen. He is supposed to
    discover a bad stitch and asks: "Who did it, Blue Cap?" The
    latter immediately answers: "Not I, sir." "Who then, sir?"
    "Yellow Cap, sir." Yellow Cap must then answer at once in the
    same manner and name another workman. Any one who fails to
    answer to his name pays a forfeit. If carried on in a brisk
    manner, this game will cause endless amusement.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>It</h3>

    <p>One of the players is asked to go outside while the company
    thinks of some person in the room, and on his return he has to
    guess of whom the company has thought.</p>

    <p>The players then arrange themselves in a circle, and agree
    each to think of his or her right-hand neighbor; it is best to
    have a girl and boy alternately, as this adds much to the
    amusement.</p>

    <p>The one outside is then called in, and commences to ask
    questions. Before replying, the player asked must be careful to
    notice his or her right-hand neighbor, and then give a correct
    reply. For instance, supposing the first question to be: "Is
    the person thought of a boy or a girl?" The answer would
    possibly be "A boy;" the next person would then be asked the
    color of the complexion, the next one the color of the hair, if
    long or short, etc., to which questions the answers would, of
    course, be given according to the right-hand neighbor.</p>

    <p>Nearly all the answers will contradict the previous ones,
    and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
       id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> something like this may be
       the result: "A boy," "very dark complexion," "long yellow
       hair," "wearing a black velvet jacket," "with a dark green
       dress," "five feet high," "about six years old," etc. When
       the player guessing gives the game up, the joke is explained
       to him.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Acting Rhymes</h3>

    <p>For this game, half the players go outside the door, while
    those who stay in the room choose a word of one syllable, which
    should not be too difficult. For instance, suppose the word
    chosen be "Flat," those who are out of the room are informed
    that a word has been thought of that rhymes with "Cat," and
    they then have to act without speaking, all the words they can
    think of that rhyme with "Cat." Supposing their first idea be
    "Bat," they come into the room and play an imaginary game of
    cricket. This not being correct, they would get hissed for
    their pains, and they must then hurry outside again. They might
    next try "Rat," most of them going into the room on their hands
    and feet, while the others might pretend to be frightened.
    Again they would be hissed. At last the boys go in and fall
    flat on their faces, while the girls pretend to use flat-irons
    upon their backs. The loud clapping that follows tells them
    that they are right at last. They then change places with the
    audience, who, in their turn, become the actors.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Man and Object</h3>

    <p>Two persons go out of the room, and after agreeing together
    as to what they shall represent, they come back again, and sit
    side by side in front of the company. One of the two takes the
    part of some well-known person, and the other represents an
    object which is closely connected with that person; for
    instance, say one represents the governor, and the other the
    mayor. When the two return to the room, the other players take
    it in turns to ask each of them a question, to which both the
    man and the object must reply either "Yes" or "No," until the
    right person and the right object have been guessed.</p>

    <p>The first player will perhaps ask the "man:" "Are you
    alive?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:75%;">
        <a href="images/55.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/55.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The man will reply, "Yes;" then the object is asked: "Are
    you of wood?" "No." The second player next questions him, and
    then the third, and so on until every one has had a turn at
    questioning, or the person and the object have been
    guessed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Jolly Miller</h3>

    <p>The players decide among themselves which one of their
    number shall act the part of the Jolly Miller. This being done,
    each little boy <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
       id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span> chooses a little girl as
       partner; the Jolly Miller having taken his stand in the
       middle of the room, they all commence to walk arm-in-arm
       round him, singing the following lines:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>There was a jolly miller who lived by himself;</p>

            <p>As the wheel went round he made his wealth;</p>

            <p>One hand in the hopper, and the other on the
            bag;</p>

            <p>As the wheel went round he made his grab.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>At the word "Grab" all must change partners, and while the
    change is going on the miller has the opportunity given him of
    securing a partner for himself. Should he succeed in doing so,
    the one left without a partner must take the place of the Jolly
    Miller, and must occupy the center of the room until fortunate
    enough to get another partner.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Ruth and Jacob</h3>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:27%;">
        <a href="images/56.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/56.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>One player is blindfolded, the rest dance in a circle round
    him till he points at one of them. This person then enters the
    ring, and when the blindman calls out "Ruth," answers "Jacob,"
    and moves about within the circle so as to avoid being caught
    by the blindman, and continues to answer "Jacob," as often as
    the blindman calls out "Ruth." This continues until "Ruth" is
    caught. "Jacob" must then guess who it is he has caught; if he
    guesses correctly, "Ruth" takes his place, and the game goes
    on; if he guesses wrongly, he continues to be "Jacob."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Checkers</h3>

    <p>This is a splendid game and one very easily learned. It is
    played upon a special board with thirty-two white and
    thirty-two black squares.</p>

    <p>Two persons play at the game, who sit opposite to each
    other. The players have each a set of twelve pieces, or "men,"
    the color of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> sets being different, so that
       the players can distinguish their own men easily. The men
       are round and flat, and are usually made of boxwood or ebony
       and ivory, one set being white and the other black.</p>

    <p>Before placing the men upon the board, it must be decided
    whether the white or the black squares are to be played on, as
    the whole must be put on one color only. If the white squares
    are selected, there must be a black square in the right-hand
    corner; if the black squares are to be played upon, then the
    right-hand corner square must be a white one.</p>

    <p>The movements in checkers are very simple; a man can be
    moved only one square at a time, except as explained hereafter,
    and that diagonally, never straight forward or sideways. If an
    opponent's man stand in the way, no move can take place unless
    there be a vacant square beyond it, into which the man can be
    lifted. In this case the man leaped over is "taken" and removed
    from the board.</p>

    <p>The great object of the game, then, is to clear the board of
    the opponent's men, or to hem them in in such a way that they
    cannot be moved, whichever player hems in the opponent or
    clears the board first gains the victory. As no man can be
    moved more than one step diagonally at a time (except when
    taking opponent's pieces), there can be no taking until the two
    parties come to close quarters; therefore, the pushing of the
    men continuously into each other's ground is the principle of
    the game.</p>

    <p>In beginning the game, a great advantage can be obtained by
    having the first move; the rule, therefore, is, if several
    games are played, that the first move be taken alternately by
    the players.</p>

    <p>When either of the players has, with his men, reached the
    extreme row of squares on the opposite side (the first row of
    his opponent), those men are entitled to be crowned, which is
    done by placing on the top of each another man, which may be
    selected from the men already removed from the board. The men
    so crowned are called "Kings" and have a new power of movement,
    as the player may now move them either backward or forward, as
    he wills, but always diagonally as before.</p>

    <p>The Kings having this double power of movement, it is an
    important point for a player to get as many men crowned as
    possible. If each player should be fortunate enough to get two
    or three Kings, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> game becomes very exciting.
       Immediately after crowning, it is well for a player to start
       blocking up his opponent's men, so as to allow more freedom
       for his own pieces, and thus prepare for winning the
       game.</p>

    <p>It is the rule that if a player touch one of his men he must
    play it. If player A omit to take a man when it is in his power
    to do so, his opponent B can huff him; that is, take the man of
    the player A off the board. If it is to B's advantage, he may
    insist on his own man being taken, which is called a "blow."
    The usual way is to take the man of the player A who made the
    omission, and who was huffed, off the board.</p>

    <p>It is not considered right or fair for any one watching the
    game to advise what move to be made, or for a player to wait
    longer than five minutes between each move.</p>

    <p>Great care should be taken in moving the men, as one false
    move may at any time endanger the whole game.</p>

    <p>With constant practice any one can soon become a very fair
    player, but even after the game has been played only a few
    times it will be found very interesting.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Dominoes</h3>

    <p>There are several ways of playing Dominoes, but the
    following game is the most simple:</p>

    <p>The dominoes are placed on the table, face downward, and
    each player takes up one, to decide who is to play first. The
    one who draws the stone with the highest number of pips on it
    takes the lead. The two stones are then put back among the
    rest; the dominoes are then shuffled, face downward, and the
    players choose seven stones each, placing them upright on the
    table, so that each can see his own stones, without being able
    to overlook those of his opponent.</p>

    <p>As there are twenty-eight stones in an ordinary set, there
    will still be fourteen left from which to draw.</p>

    <p>The player who has won the lead now places a stone, face
    upward, on the table. Suppose it be double-six, the other
    player is bound to put down a stone on which six appears,
    placing the six next to the double-six.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
       id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> Perhaps he may put six-four;
       the first player then puts six-five, placing his six against
       the opposite six of the double-six; the second follows with
       five-four, placing his five against the five already on the
       table; thus, you see, the players are bound to put down a
       stone which corresponds at one end with one of the end
       numbers of those already played. Whenever a player has no
       corresponding number he must draw from the fourteen that
       were left out for that purpose. If, when twelve of these
       fourteen stones are used up, he cannot play, he loses his
       turn, and his opponent plays instead of him. The two
       remaining dominoes must not be drawn.</p>

    <p>When one of the players has used up all his dominoes, his
    opponent turns up those he has left, the pips are then counted,
    and the number of pips is scored to the account of the player
    who was out first.</p>

    <p>If neither player can play, the stones are turned face
    upward on the table, and the one who has the smallest number of
    pips scores as follows: If the pips of one player count ten and
    those of the other player five, the five is deducted from the
    ten, leaving five to be scored by the player whose pips only
    counted five.</p>

    <p>The dominoes are shuffled again, the second player this time
    taking the lead, and the game proceeds in this way until one or
    other has scored a hundred, the first to do so winning the
    game.</p>

    <p>This game is generally played by two only, though it is
    possible for four, five, or even six to join in it; but, in
    that case, they cannot, of course, take seven stones each, so
    they must divide the stones equally between them, leaving a few
    to draw from, if they prefer it; if not they can divide them
    all.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Green Gravel</h3>

    <p>In this game the children join hands and walk round in a
    circle, singing the following words:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Green gravel, green gravel, your grass is so
            green,</p>

            <p>The fairest young damsel that ever was seen.</p>

            <p>I'll wash you in new milk and dress you in silk,</p>

            <p>And write down your name with a gold pen and
            ink.</p>

            <p>Oh! (Mary) Oh! (Mary) your true love is dead;</p>

            <p>He's sent you a letter to turn round your head.</p>
        </div>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>

    <p>When the players arrive at that part of the song, "Oh,
    Mary!" they name some member of the company; when the song is
    finished, the one named must turn right round and face the
    outside of the ring, having her back to all the other players.
    She then joins hands in this position and the game continues as
    before until all the players face outward. They then
    recommence, until they all face the inside of the ring as at
    first.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Fives and Threes</h3>

    <p>This is another game that is played with dominoes, and is
    one of the most popular. It is excellent practice for counting,
    and to be successful at it depends, in a very great measure,
    upon skill in doing this. Two, three or four players may take
    part in this game. After the dominoes have been shuffled, face
    downward, each player takes an equal number of stones, leaving
    always three, at least, upon the table; no player, however, may
    take more than seven, and it is perhaps better to limit the
    number to five.</p>

    <p>In playing dominoes, it should always be borne in mind that
    one end of the domino to be played must always agree in number
    with the end of the domino it is to be placed against.</p>

    <p>The object of the game is to make as many "fives" and
    "threes" as are possible; for instance, a player should always
    make the domino show fifteen if he can, as three divides into
    fifteen five times, and five divides into fifteen three times,
    and he would thus score 8 (three and five). The way to count is
    to add the two extreme ends together, always, of course, trying
    to make the number as high as possible, and to make it one into
    which either three or five will divide, as if a number be
    formed into which these numbers will not divide, no score will
    result.</p>

    <p>Suppose there are two players, A and B. A starts the game by
    playing the double-six, for which he scores 4 (three dividing
    into twelve four times). B then plays the six-three, making
    fifteen, and thus scores 8 (the highest score possible, as
    explained above). A next plays the double-three, which makes
    eighteen, and scores 6 (three dividing into eighteen six
    times). B then plays six-blank onto the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
       id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span> double-six on the left-hand
       side and scores 2 (three dividing into six twice). A holding
       the blank-three, places it onto the blank end, making the
       number nine, and scores 3. B next plays the three-four,
       which makes ten, and 2 is added to his score (five dividing
       into ten twice). Thus the game proceeds, each player trying
       to make as many fives and threes as possible.</p>

    <h2>PAPER AND PENCIL GAMES</h2>

    <h3>Birds, Beasts, and Fishes</h3>

    <p>Take your pencil and write upon the top of your paper the
    words, "Birds, Beasts, and Fishes." Then tell your companion
    that you are going to think of, for instance, an animal. Put
    down the first and last letters of the name, filling in with
    crosses the letters that have been omitted. For example, write
    down on the paper C*******e. Your companion would have to think
    of all the animals' names that he could remember which
    contained nine letters, and commenced with the letter C and
    ended with "e." If the second player after guessing several
    times "gives it up," the first player would tell him that the
    animal thought of was "Crocodile," and would then think of
    another Bird, Beast, or Fish, and write it down in a similar
    manner. If, however, the name of the animal be guessed, then it
    would be the second player's turn to take the paper and
    pencil.</p>

    <h3>Noughts and Crosses</h3>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:35%;">

    </div>

    <p>This is a game every boy or girl thoroughly enjoys. Take
    paper, and with a pencil draw four cross lines as shown:</p>

    <div class="figright"

    <p>Two persons only can play at this game, one player taking
    "noughts," the other "crosses." The idea is for the one player
    to try and draw three "noughts" in a line before the other
    player can do the same with three "crosses." Supposing the
    player who <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"
       id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span> places his "O" in the
       right-hand top corner, the player who has taken the
       "crosses" will perhaps place an "X" in the left-hand top
       corner. The next "O" would be placed in the bottom left-hand
       corner; then to prevent the line of three "noughts" being
       completed, the second player would place his "X" in the
       center square. An "O" would then be immediately placed in
       the right-hand bottom corner, so that wherever the "X" was
       placed by the next player, the "noughts" would be bound to
       win. Say, for instance, the "X" has chosen the "noughts"
       commences and was placed in the center square on the
       right-hand side, the place for the "O" to be put would be
       the center square at the bottom, thus securing the game. The
       diagram would then appear as illustrated:</p>

    <h3>"Tit, Tat, Toe"</h3>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:35%;">
        <a href="images/62-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/62-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>There can be two, three, or four players for this game.
    First take paper and pencil and write the players' names across
    the top of the paper in the order in which they are to play.
    Next draw a large circle, in the center of which draw a smaller
    one, placing the number 100 within it. The space between the
    inner and outer circles must be divided into parts, each having
    a number, as shown in the diagram.</p>

    <p>This having been done, the first player closes his eyes,
    takes the pencil, and places his hand over the paper, the point
    of the pencil just touching it. He then repeats the following
    rhyme, moving the pencil round and round while doing so:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Tit, tat, toe,</p>

            <p>My first go,</p>

            <p>Four jolly butcher
            boys</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"
               id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>

            <p>All in a row.</p>

            <p>Stick one up,</p>

            <p>Stick one down,</p>

            <p>Stick one in</p>

            <p>The old man's crown.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>At the word "crown" the player must keep the point of the
    pencil firmly on the paper, and open his eyes. If the pencil is
    not within the circle, or if within but with the point of the
    pencil resting upon a line, then the player gives the pencil to
    the next player, having scored nothing.</p>

    <p>If, on the contrary, at the end of the rhyme, the pencil is
    found to be resting in a division of the circle, for instance,
    marked "70," that number is placed beneath the player's name,
    and the section is struck by drawing a line across it. If
    afterward the pencil rest in a division of the circle that has
    been struck out, the player loses his turn in the same way as
    if the pencil were not in the circle at all, or had rested upon
    a line of the diagram.</p>

    <p>The game continues until all the divisions of the circle
    have been scored out, when the numbers gained by each of the
    players are added up, and the one who has scored the highest
    number of points wins the game.</p>

    <h2>CARD GAMES</h2>

    <h3>Speculation</h3>

    <p>Speculation is a game at which any number of persons may
    play. The stakes are made with counters or nuts, and the value
    of the stakes is settled by the company. The highest trump in
    each deal wins the pool.</p>

    <p>When the dealer has been chosen, he puts, say, six counters
    in the pool and every other player puts four; three cards are
    given to each person, though they must be dealt one at a time;
    another card is then turned up, and called the trump card. The
    cards must be left upon the table, but the player on the
    left-hand side of the dealer turns up his top card so that all
    may see it. If it is a trump card, that is to say, if it is of
    the same suit as the card the dealer turned up, the owner
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
       id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> may either keep his card or
       sell it, and the other players bid for it in turn. Of
       course, the owner sells it for the highest price he can
       get.</p>

    <p>The next player then turns up his card, keeps it or sells
    it, and so the game goes on until all the cards have been shown
    and disposed of, and then the player who holds the highest
    trump either in his own hand or among the cards he has bought,
    takes the pool, and there is another deal.</p>

    <p>Should none of the other players have a trump card in his
    hand, and the turn-up card not having been purchased by another
    player, the dealer takes the pool.</p>

    <p>If any one look at his cards out of turn, he can be made to
    turn all three up, so that the whole company can see them.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>All Fours</h3>

    <p>This game takes its name from the four chances or points of
    which it consists, namely, "High," "Low," "Jack," and "Game."
    It may be played by two or four players, but the same rules
    apply to each.</p>

    <p>The four points, which have been already mentioned, count as
    follows: "High," the highest trump out; the holder scores one
    point. "Low," the lowest trump out; the original holder of it
    scores one point even if it is taken by his adversary. "Jack,"
    the knave of trumps; the holder scores one point, unless it be
    won by his adversary, in which case the winner scores one.
    "Game," the greatest number of tricks gained by either party;
    reckoning for each Ace four toward game, each King three toward
    game, each Queen two toward game, each Jack one toward game,
    each Ten ten toward game.</p>

    <p>The other cards do not count toward game; thus it may happen
    that a deal may be played without either party having any to
    score for "Game."</p>

    <p>When the players hold equal numbers, the dealer does not
    score.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/plate4.jpg"><img width="100%"
             src="images/thumb4.jpg"
             alt="Plate 4 (click to view)." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Begging is when the player next the dealer does not like his
    cards and says, "I beg," in which case the dealer must either
    let him score one, saying, "Take one," or give three more cards
    from the pack to all the players and then turn up the next card
    for trumps; if the trump turned up is the same suit as the
    last, the dealer must give another
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> three cards until a different
       suit turns up trumps. In playing this game the ace is the
       highest card and the deuce (the two) is the lowest.</p>

    <p>Having shuffled and cut a pack of cards, the dealer gives
    six to each player. If there be two playing, he turns up the
    thirteenth card for trumps; if four are playing, he turns up
    the twenty-fifth. Should the turn-up be a jack, the dealer
    scores one point. The player next the dealer looks at his hand
    and either holds it or "begs," as explained.</p>

    <p>The game then begins by the player next the dealer leading a
    card, the others following suit, the highest card taking the
    trick, and so on until the six tricks have been won. When the
    six tricks are played, the points are taken for High, Low,
    Jack, and Game.</p>

    <p>Should no player have either a court card or a ten, the
    player next to the dealer scores the point for the game. If
    only one trump should be out, it counts both High and Low to
    the player who first has it. The first great thing in this game
    is to try and win the jack; next you must try and make the
    tens; and you must also try and win the tricks.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Snap</h3>

    <p>The pack of cards is dealt round, face downward, and each
    player packs his cards together, without looking at them, and
    then places them in front of him.</p>

    <p>The first player then turns up the top card of his pack, the
    next does the same, and so on in turn; but, as soon as a player
    turns up a card corresponding in number to the one already
    lying, uncovered, on the table, one of the two to whom the
    cards belong cries, "Snap."</p>

    <p>Whichever succeeds in saying it first takes, not only the
    snap card of the other player, but all the cards he has already
    turned up, and also those he has himself turned up. The cards
    he wins must be placed at the bottom of his own pack.</p>

    <p>The one who succeeds in winning all the cards wins the game.
    It is necessary to be very attentive and very quick if you want
    to be successful at this game.</p>

    <p>There is a game very similar to the above called "Animal
    Snap." Each player takes the name of an animal, and instead of
    crying "Snap," he must cry the name of the animal chosen by the
    player who <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> turned up the last card. For
       instance, suppose a five be turned up and a player who has
       chosen the name of "Tiger" turn up another five, instead of
       crying "Snap," "Tiger" would be called if "Tiger" did not
       succeed in crying the other player's name first.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Snip, Snap, Snorum</h3>

    <p>This is a first-rate game and very exciting. Any number of
    players may take part in it, and the whole of the fifty-two
    cards are dealt out.</p>

    <p>Each player has five counters, and there is a pool in the
    middle, which is empty at the commencement of the game.</p>

    <p>The first player plays a card&mdash;say it is a
    six&mdash;then the one next to him looks through his cards, and
    if he has another six he puts it down and says, "Snip"; the
    first player must then pay a counter into the pool.</p>

    <p>If the next player should chance to have another six, he
    plays it and says "Snap," and the one who is snapped must pay
    in his turn, but the fine is increased to two counters. Should
    the fourth player have the fourth six, he plays it, and says,
    "Snorum," and the third player must now pay; his fine is three
    counters to the pool. No person may play out of his turn, and
    every one must "snip" when it is in his power. When any one has
    paid the whole of his five counters to the pool he retires from
    the game; the pool becomes the property of the one whose
    counters last the longest.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Old Maid</h3>

    <p>From a pack of cards take out one queen, shuffle the cards
    and deal them, face downward, equally among all the players.
    The cards should then be taken, the pairs sorted out and thrown
    upon the table. By "pairs" is meant two kings, or two fives,
    and so on. When all the pairs have been sorted out, the dealer
    offers the remainder of his cards to his felt-hand neighbor,
    who draws any card he chooses to select, though he is only
    allowed to see the backs of them. The player who has drawn then
    looks at the cards to see if he can pair it with one he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
       id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span> holds in his hand; if he can,
       he throws out the pair; if not, he must place it with his
       other cards. It is now his turn to offer his cards to his
       neighbor, and so the game goes on until all the cards are
       paired, except, of course, the odd card which is the
       companion to the banished queen. The holder of this card is
       "the old maid."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Pope Joan</h3>

    <p>This amusing game is for any number of players, and is
    played with a wooden board which is divided into compartments
    or pools, and can be bought cheaply at any toy shop for a small
    sum. Failing a board, use a sheet of paper marked out in
    squares.</p>

    <p>Before dealing, the eight of diamonds is taken out of the
    pack, and the deal is settled by cutting the cards, and whoever
    turns up the first jack is dealer.</p>

    <p>The dealer then shuffles the cards and his left-hand
    neighbor cuts them. The dealer must next "dress the board,"
    that is, he must put counters into the pools, which are all
    marked differently. This is the way to dress the board: One
    counter to each ace, king, queen, jack, and game, two to
    matrimony (king and queen), two to intrigue (queen and jack),
    and six to the nine of diamonds, which is the Pope. On a proper
    board you will see these marked on it.</p>

    <p>The cards are now dealt round to the players, with the
    exception of one card, which is turned up for trumps, and six
    or eight, which are put aside to form the stops; the four kings
    and the seven of diamonds are also always stops.</p>

    <p>If either ace, king, queen, or jack happen to be turned up
    for trumps, the dealer may take whatever is in the compartment
    with that mark; but when Pope is turned up for trumps, the
    dealer takes all the counters in Pope's compartment as well as
    those in the "game" compartment, besides a counter for every
    card dealt to each player, which must, of course, be paid by
    the players. There is then a fresh deal.</p>

    <p>It is very seldom, however, that Pope does turn up for
    trumps; when it does not happen, the player next to the dealer
    begins to play, trying to get rid of as many cards as possible.
    First he leads cards which he knows will be stops, then Pope,
    if he has it, and afterward
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> the lowest card in his suit,
       particularly an ace, for that can never be led up to. The
       other players follow when they can; for instance, if the
       leader plays the two of diamonds, whoever holds the three
       plays it, some one follows with the four, and so on until a
       stop occurs; whoever plays the card which makes a stop
       becomes leader and can play what he chooses.</p>

    <p>This goes on until some person has parted with all his
    cards, by which he wins the counters in the "game" compartment
    and receives from the players a counter for every card they
    hold. Should any one hold the Pope he is excused from paying,
    unless he happens to have played it.</p>

    <p>Whoever plays any of the cards which have pools or
    compartments takes the counters in that pool. If any of these
    cards are not played, the counters remain over for the next
    game.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>"I Suspect You"</h3>

    <p>This game may be played by any number of persons. As soon as
    the cards have been dealt and the players have examined their
    hands, the one on the left of the dealer plays the lowest card
    he has (the ace counting lowest). He must place the card face
    downward on the table, at the same time calling out what it is.
    The next player also puts down a card, face downward, and calls
    the next number; for instance, if No. 1 puts down a card and
    says "One," No. 2 says "Two," No. 3 "Three," and so on.</p>

    <p>It is not necessary for the card laid down to be actually
    the one called out. The fun of the game is to put down the
    wrong card without, any one suspecting you. Naturally, it is
    not often that the cards run straight on, as no one may play
    out of turn, and if one player thinks another has put down the
    wrong card, he says, "I suspect you." The player must then show
    his card, and if it should not be the one he said, he must take
    all the cards laid down and add them to his pack; if, however,
    the card happens to be the right one, then the accuser must
    take the cards. The player who first succeeds in getting rid of
    his cards wins the game.</p>
    <hr class="short" />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"
       id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>

    <h3>Beggar My Neighbor</h3>

    <p>The cards are dealt equally to the players. The first player
    puts down a card, face upward, upon the table. If it be a
    common card, that is, a two, or three, or anything but a
    picture card or an ace, his neighbors put down in turn their
    cards until a court card (that is, a picture card or an ace)
    turns up.</p>

    <p>If at last an ace be played, the neighbor of the one who
    plays it must pay him four cards; if a king three cards, if a
    queen two, and if a jack one. The one who played the court card
    also takes all the cards that have been played, and puts them
    under his own pack. If, however, in playing for a court card,
    one of the players puts down another court card, then his
    neighbor must pay him, and he takes the whole pack instead of
    the previous player. Sometimes it happens that a second player
    in paying puts down a court card, and the third player in
    paying him puts down another, and so on, until perhaps the
    fourth or fifth player actually gets the cards in the end.</p>

    <h2>RIDDLES</h2>

    <p>Few children think they will ever tire of playing games; but
    all the same, toward the end of a long evening, spent merrily
    in dancing and playing, the little ones begin to get too weary
    to play any longer, and it is very difficult to keep them
    amused.</p>

    quietly round the room, resting after their romps and laughter,

    <p>It is, however, very difficult to remember a number of good

    <h3>Thought Reading</h3>

    <p>This is a very good game, which always causes considerable
    amusement, and if skillfully carried out will very successfully
    mystify the whole company.</p>

    <p>It is necessary that the player who is to take the part of
    thought-reader should have a confederate, and the game is then
    played as follows:</p>

    <p>The thought-reader, having arranged that the confederate
    should write a certain word, commences by asking four members
    of the company to write each a word upon a piece of paper, fold
    it up in such a manner that it cannot be seen, and then to pass
    it on to him. The confederate, of course, volunteers to make
    one of the four, and writes the word previously agreed upon,
    which is, we will suppose, "Ohio."</p>

    <p>The thought-reader places the slips of paper between his
    fingers, taking care to put the paper of his confederate
    between the third and little finger; he then takes the folded
    paper from between his thumb
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> and first finger and rubs it,
       folded as it is, over his forehead, at each rub mentioning a
       letter, as O, rub, H, rub, I O, after which he calls out
       that some lady or gentleman has written "Ohio." "I did,"
       replies the confederate.</p>

    <p>The thought-reader then opens the paper, looks at it, and
    slips it into his pocket; he has, however, looked at one of the
    other papers.</p>

    <p>Consequently he is now in a position to spell another word,
    which he proceeds to do in the same manner, and thus the game
    goes on until all the papers have been read.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Cushion Dance</h3>

    <p>The children first of all divide themselves into two
    parties. They then form a ring, and commence dancing round a
    hassock which is placed, end upward, in the middle of the room.
    Suddenly one party endeavors to pull the other party forward,
    so as to force one of their number to kick the hassock and
    upset it.</p>

    <p>The player who has been unfortunate enough to touch the
    hassock has then to leave the circle. The game proceeds until
    only two remain; if these two happen to be boys, the struggle
    is generally prolonged, as they can so easily jump over the
    hassock, and avoid kicking it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Farmyard</h3>

    <p>This game, if carried out properly, will cause great
    amusement. One of the party announces that he will whisper to
    each person the name of some animal, which, at a given signal,
    must be imitated as loudly as possible. Instead, however, of
    giving the name of an animal to each, he whispers to all the
    company, with the exception of one, to keep perfectly silent.
    To this one he whispers that the animal he is to imitate is the
    donkey. After a short time, so that all may be in readiness,
    the signal is given. Instead of all the party making the sounds
    of various animals, nothing is heard but a loud bray from the
    one unfortunate member of the company.</p>
    <hr class="short" />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"
       id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span>

    <h3>"I Point"</h3>

    <p>It is necessary in this game for the player acting the part
    of guesser to have a confederate; he is then able to leave the
    room, and on his return to mention what person was pointed at
    during his absence. It is done in this way: It is agreed
    between the guesser and his confederate that whoever speaks
    last before the door is closed upon the guesser shall be the
    person who is to be pointed at. It is very seldom that any one
    discovers this trick.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Diamond Ring</h3>

    <p>The players sit in a circle with their hands placed palm to
    palm, the little fingers downward, between the knees. One of
    the company is chosen to act the part of maid. She takes a ring
    between her palms, which she keeps flat together in the same
    way as the rest. She then visits each person in turn and places
    her hands between the palms of each, so that she is able to
    slip the ring into some one's hands without the others knowing.
    When she has visited each, she touches one child, and says:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"My lady's lost her diamond ring;</p>

            <p>I fix upon you to find it."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The child touched must then guess who has the ring. If she
    guess correctly, she becomes the maid; if not, she must pay a
    forfeit. The maid then touches some one else and repeats the
    two lines given above. Each guesser may be allowed three
    trials.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Forbidden Letter</h3>

    <p>The idea of this game is to try how many sentences can be
    spoken without containing a certain letter which has been
    agreed upon. Supposing, for instance, the letter "f" is not to
    be introduced; the first player might ask: "Is this a new game
    to you?" The second player could answer: "Oh, no! I played it
    years ago when quite a
    youngster."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
       id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>

    <p>He would perhaps turn to the third player, and ask: "You
    remember it, do you not?" The third player might answer: "Yes;
    but we used to play it differently." This player, having used a
    word with an "f" in it, must pay a forfeit and remain out.</p>

    <p>The answers must be given at once, without hesitation, and
    the player who avoids for the greatest length of time using a
    word containing the forbidden letter wins the game.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Grand Mufti</h3>

    <p>One of the company is chosen as Grand Mufti. The others then
    form a circle with the Grand Mufti in the center, and every
    action which he performs, if preceded by the words, "Thus says
    the Grand Mufti," must be imitated by every member of the
    circle.</p>

    <p>The Grand Mufti, in order to lead one of the company astray,
    will sometimes omit to say the words: "Thus says the Grand
    Mufti;" in this case, if any member of the company imitate his
    action, he is compelled to pay a forfeit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Magic Writing</h3>

    <p>In this game a confederate is necessary. The player states
    to the company, after a few remarks on ancient sign-language,
    that he is able to read signs made with a stick on the floor,
    and agrees to leave the room while the company decide upon some
    word or sentence.</p>

    <p>The game is played as follows: It is agreed by the player
    and his confederate that one tap on the floor shall represent
    A, two taps E, three taps I, four taps O, and five taps U, and
    that the first letter of each remark the confederate makes
    shall be one of the consonants of the word or sentence decided
    upon by the company. The consonants must be taken in order. On
    the player's return, supposing the word chosen to be "March,"
    his confederate would commence: "Many people think this game a
    deception" (initial letter M). One tap on the floor (A).
    "Really it is very simple" (initial letter R). "Coming to the
    end soon" (initial letter C). "Hope it has been quite clear"
    (initial letter H).</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>

    <p>A few more signs are made so as not to finish too abruptly,
    and the player then states the word to be "March." If carefully
    conducted, this game will interest an audience for a
    considerable time.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Flowers</h3>

    <p>The company divides itself into equal sides, and each side
    must have a "home" in opposite corners of the room. The sides
    retire to their own "homes," and one side privately chooses a
    flower, then crosses over to the other corner and gives the
    initial letter of that flower. The children on the second side
    must try and guess the name of the flower, and when they have
    done so they catch as many as they can of the opposite side
    before they reach their "home."</p>

    <p>Those caught must go over to the other side, and the game
    goes on until one side has won all the children. The sides take
    it in turns to give the name of the flower. This game may also
    be played in the garden.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Fox and Geese</h3>

    <p>One of the party, called the Fox, goes to one end of the
    room, and the rest of the children arrange themselves in a
    ring, one behind the other, the tallest first and the smallest
    last. The first one is called Mother Goose. The game begins by
    a conversation between the Fox and Mother Goose. "What are you
    after this fine morning?" says she. "Taking a walk," the Fox
    answers. "What for?" "To get an appetite for breakfast." "What
    will you have for breakfast?" "A nice fat goose." "Where will
    you get it?" "Well, as your geese are so handy, I will take one
    of them." "Catch one if you can."</p>

    <p>Mother Goose then stretches out her arms to protect her
    geese and not let the Fox catch one. The Fox tries to dodge
    under, right and left, until he is able to catch the last of
    the string. Of course, the brood must try and keep out of reach
    of the Fox. As the geese are caught they must go over to the
    den of the Fox, and the game continues until all are
    caught.</p>

    <h3>"I Sell My Bat, I Sell My Ball"</h3>

    <p>A ring is formed with one child in the middle, who is called
    the "drummer-man." Whatever this child does the others mimic,
    moving round as they do so, and singing the following
    words:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"I sell my bat, I sell my ball,</p>

            <p>I sell my spinning-wheel and all;</p>

            <p>And I'll do all that e'er I can</p>

            <p>To follow the eyes of the drummer-man."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Any one who does not at once imitate the "drummer-man" must
    pay a forfeit and take his place as "drummer-man."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>"What's My Thought Like?"</h3>

    <p>The players sit in a circle, and one of them asks the
    others: "What's my thought like?" One player may say: "A
    monkey;" the second, "A candle;" the third, "A pin," and so on.
    When all the company have compared the thought to some object,
    the first player tells them the thought&mdash;perhaps it is
    "the Cat"&mdash;and then asks each, in turn, why it is like the
    object he compared it to.</p>

    <p>"Why is my cat like a monkey?" is asked. The other player
    might answer: "Because it is full of tricks." "Why is my cat
    like a candle?" "Because its eyes glow like a candle in the
    dark." "Why is my cat like a pin?" "Because its claws scratch
    like a pin."</p>

    <p>Any one who is unable to explain why the thought resembles
    the object he mentioned must pay a forfeit.</p>

    <h3>Personations</h3>

    <p>To play this game the company seat themselves in a circle,
    while one of the players commences to describe some person with
    whom most of the other players are familiar, and continues
    until one or other of the company is able to guess from the
    description who the person may be.</p>

    <p>The one guessing correctly then commences to describe some
    one. If, however, the company are unable to make a correct
    guess, the player goes on until some one is successful.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Frog in the Middle</h3>

    <p>One child is seated on the ground with his legs under him,
    while the other players form a ring round him. They then pull
    him about and give him little pushes, and he must try to catch
    one without rising from the floor.</p>

    <p>The child who is caught takes the middle, while the frog
    joins the circle.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Giant</h3>

    <p>This game must be arranged in the nature of a surprise for
    the company assembled. The giant is formed by two youngsters,
    one of whom seats himself on the shoulders of his friend. A
    large cloak should then be thrown over them, to make it appear
    as if it were only one person, and the top boy might wear a
    mask to prevent recognition. The giant then enters the room and
    commences dancing. Great amusement is afforded the little folk
    by this game.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Cock Fighting</h3>

    <p>This is a most amusing game, and although only two boys can
    play at it at one time, they will keep the rest of the company
    in roars of laughter. The two who are to represent the "cocks"
    having been chosen, they are both seated upon the
    floor.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>

    <p>Each boy has his wrists tied together with a handkerchief,
    and his legs secured just above the ankles with another
    handkerchief; his arms are then passed over his knees, and a
    broomstick is pushed over one arm, under both knees, and out
    again on the other side over the other arm. The "cocks" are now
    considered ready for fighting, and are carried into the center
    of the room, and placed opposite each other with their toes
    just touching. The fun now commences.</p>

    <p>Each "cock" tries with the aid of his toes to turn his
    opponent over on his back or side.</p>

    <p>The one who can succeed in doing this first wins the
    game.</p>

    <p>It often happens that both "cocks" turn over at the same
    time, when the fight commences again.</p>

    <h3>Games with the Alphabet</h3>

    <p>It is necessary for these games that a large boxful of
    letters should be provided, which can be purchased at any toy
    store or made by the young people themselves by being cut out
    of newspapers. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> children should seat
       themselves round the table; the letters should then be well
       shuffled and dealt round to the players. Each child has to
       form a word or sentence out of the letters which he has
       received. Another variation is to select a long word, and
       then in a given time to try to form several words from it.
       Names of well-known men, places, etc., can also be given.
       These games are not only amusing, but serve at the same time
       to instruct the young folk.</p>

    <h3>Honey Pots</h3>

    <p>For little ones there is scarcely a more popular game than
    "Honey Pots." Small children of three and four can be included
    in this game, but there should be two bigger children for the
    "Buyer" and the "Merchant." The children, with the exception of
    the Buyer and Merchant, seat themselves upon the floor of the
    room, with their knees raised and their hands clasped together
    round them. These children are called "Honey Pots." The
    Merchant and the Buyer then talk about the quality and quantity
    of the Honey, and the price of each Pot. It is agreed that the
    price to be paid shall be according to the weight of the
    "Honey" and the "Pot." The children are carefully "weighed" by
    raising them two or three times from the floor and swinging
    them by the arms, one arm held by the Merchant and the other by
    the Buyer.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:60%;">
        <a href="images/85.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/85.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>

    <p>When the "Honey Pots" are all weighed, the Buyer says he
    will purchase the whole of the stock, and asks the Merchant to
    help him carry the Pots home. Then the Merchant and the Buyer
    carry the children, one by one, to the other end of the
    room.</p>

    <p>When all are safely at the Buyer's house, the Merchant goes
    out of the room, but suddenly returns and says to the Buyer: "I
    believe you have carried off my little daughter in one of the
    Honey Pots." The Buyer replies: "I think not. You sold me all
    the Pots full of Honey, but if you doubt me you can taste
    them."</p>

    <p>The Merchant then pretends to taste the Honey, and after
    having tried two or three Pots exclaims: "Ah! this tastes very
    much like my little daughter." The little girl who represents
    the Honey Pot chosen by the Merchant then cries out: "Yes, I am
    your little girl," and immediately jumps up and runs away, the
    Buyer at the same time endeavoring to catch her.</p>

    <p>When the one Honey Pot runs away, all the others do the
    same, the Buyer catches whom he can, and the game
    recommences.</p>

    <h3>The Spelling Game</h3>

    <p>Each player in this game has what are called three "lives,"
    or chances. When the company is seated in a circle, the first
    player mentions a letter as the beginning of a word. The game
    is for each of the company, in turn, to add a letter to it,
    keeping the word unfinished as long as possible.</p>

    <p>When a letter is added to the former letters and it makes a
    complete word, the person who completed it loses a "life." The
    next player then begins again.</p>

    <p>Every letter added must be part of a word, and not an odd
    letter thought of on the spur of the moment. When there is any
    doubt as to the letter used by the last player being correct,
    he may be challenged, and he will then have to give the word he
    was thinking of when adding the letter. If he cannot name the
    word, he loses a "life;" but if he can, it is the challenger
    who loses.</p>

    <p>This is an example of how the game should be played.
    Supposing the first player commences with the letter "p;" the
    next, thinking of "play," would add an "l;" the next an "o,"
    thinking of "plough;" the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> next person, not having
       either of these words in his mind, would add "v;" the next
       player, perhaps, not knowing the word of which the previous
       player was thinking, might challenge him, and would lose a
       "life" on being told the word was "plover." The player next
       in turn would then start a new word, and perhaps put down
       "b," thinking of "bat;" the next thinking, say, that the
       word was "bone," would add an "o," the next player would add
       "n;" the player whose turn it would now be, not wanting to
       lose a "life" by finishing the word, would add another "n;"
       the next player for the same reason would add "e," and then
       there would be nothing else for the next in turn to do but
       to complete the word by adding "t" and thus losing a
       "life."</p>

    <p>It will be seen that there are three ways of losing a
    "life." First, the player may lay down a letter, and on being
    challenged be unable to give the word. Secondly, he may himself
    challenge another player who is not at fault. Thirdly, he may
    be obliged to add the final letter to a word, and so complete
    it.</p>

    <p>This is a most amusing game for a large party, for as the
    different persons lose their three "lives," the players
    gradually dwindle down to two or three, when it gets very
    exciting to see who will be the last person left in, for he or
    she will be declared the winner.</p>

    <h3>"Draw a Pail of Water."</h3>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Draw a pail of water</p>

            <p>For my lady's daughter;</p>

            <p>My father's a king and my mother's a queen,</p>

            <p>My two little sisters are dressed in green;</p>

            <p>Stamping grass and parsley,</p>

            <p>Marigold leaves and daisies,</p>

            <p>One rush, two rush,</p>

            <p>Pray thee, fine lady, come under my bush."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Two children stand face to face, holding each other's hands.
    Two others also face each other holding hands across the other
    two. They seesaw backward and forward, singing the above
    lines.</p>

    <p>When they come to the line, "Pray thee, fine lady, come
    under my bush," another child pops under and comes up between
    one child's <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> arms. They sing the verse
       again and another child creeps under another pair of arms,
       and so on until there are eight children standing facing
       each other. The must then jump up and down until one falls
       down, when she is almost sure to pull the others over.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Questions and Answers</h3>

    <p>Each player is furnished with a pencil and two slips of
    paper. On the first slip a question must be written. The papers
    are then collected and put into a bag or basket.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/88.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/88.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Then the players write an answer on their second slip. These
    are put into a different bag, and the two bags are then well
    shaken and handed round to the company.</p>

    <p>Every one draws a question and an answer, and must then read
    the two out to the company.</p>

    <p>The result is sometimes very comical; for instance:</p>

    <h3>Duck Under the Water</h3>

    <p>Each child chooses a partner and stands opposite to her, so
    that two long lines are formed. Each couple hold a handkerchief
    between them, as high as they can lift their arms, so as to
    form an arch. The couple standing at the top of the lines run
    through the arch without letting go their handkerchief, and
    station themselves at the bottom of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> the lines, raising their
       handkerchief again so as to continue the arch. This is done
       by each couple in succession until all have had a turn.
       Whoever breaks the arch or drops the handkerchief must pay a
       forfeit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Wonderment</h3>

    <p>It is necessary that two only of the party should have a
    knowledge of this game, and then "wonderment" is sure to be the
    result.</p>

    <p>The two players agree that a certain word shall be regarded
    as a signal word. As an illustration, imagine this word to be
    "and."</p>

    <p>One of the players asserts his belief that he is gifted with
    second sight, and states that he is able to name, through a
    closed door, any article touched by any person in sympathy with
    him, notwithstanding the said person may attempt to mystify him
    by mentioning a lot of other articles. He then chooses his
    confederate, as being one with whom he may be in sympathy, and
    goes outside.</p>

    <p>The player in the room then proceeds to call out, perhaps,
    as follows: Table, Rug, Piano, Footstool and Chair, Lamp,
    Inkstand. He then places his hand on the back of a chair and
    asks: "What am I touching now?" the answer will, of course, be
    "Chair," because the signal word "and" came immediately before
    that article.</p>

    <p>If the players are skillful there is no need for the trick
    to be discovered.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>"Mother, Mother, the Pot Boils Over"</h3>

    <p>A number of children choose one of their number to be
    "mother" and another to be the witch. One child represents the
    pot, and the others are named after the days in the week,
    Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc. If there are too many children
    they might be called after the months.</p>

    <p>The mother first names the children, next she takes the pot
    and pretends to put it on the fire. She tells the eldest
    daughter that she is going to wash, and that she must take
    great care of her brothers and sisters while she is away, and
    on no account to let the old witch into the house. She is also
    to look after the dinner and see that the pot
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
       id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> does not boil over. The
       mother then goes away, and the eldest daughter pretends to
       be very busy.</p>

    <p>The child who is supposed to be the witch knocks at the
    door, and asks if she may come in and get a light for her pipe.
    She must pretend to be very old and walk with a stick.</p>

    <p>"Come in," says the eldest daughter; "what do you want?"</p>

    <p>"To light my pipe at your fire."</p>

    <p>"Very well, but you must not dirty the range."</p>

    <p>"Certainly not; I'll be very careful."</p>

    <p>While the eldest daughter pretends to look on the shelf for
    something, the witch puts her dirty shoe on the range, catches
    hold of Monday (the youngest child) and runs off with him. The
    child who is the pot now makes a hissing noise and pretends to
    boil over. The daughter calls out:</p>

    <p>"Mother, mother, the pot boils over."</p>

    <p>"Take a spoon and skim it."</p>

    <p>"Can't find one."</p>

    <p>"Look on the shelf."</p>

    <p>"Can't reach."</p>

    <p>"Take the stool."</p>

    <p>"The leg's broken."</p>

    <p>"Take the chair."</p>

    <p>"The chair's gone to be mended."</p>

    <p>"I suppose I must come myself."</p>

    <p>The mother comes in from the washtub, drying her hands.</p>

    <p>"Where's Monday?" she asks.</p>

    <p>"Please, mother, some one came to beg for a light for her
    pipe, and when my back was turned she took Monday."</p>

    <p>"Why, that was the witch."</p>

    <p>The mother pretends to beat the eldest daughter, tells her
    to be more careful another time, and goes back to the washtub.
    The game then goes on as before, and each time the witch comes
    she takes away a child, until at last even the eldest daughter
    is taken. The pot boils over for the last time and then the
    mother, finding all her children gone, goes to the witch's
    house to find them, when this conversation ensues:</p>

    <p>"Is this the way to the witch's
    house?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
       id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>

    <p>"There's a red bull that way."</p>

    <p>"Then I'll go this way."</p>

    <p>"There's a mad cow that way."</p>

    <p>But the mother insists upon going into the witch's house to
    look for her children. The witch generally hides the children
    behind chairs. The mother stoops over one child: "This tastes
    like Monday," she says, but the witch replies: "That! it is a
    barrel of pork."</p>

    <p>"No, no," says the mother, "it is my Monday, and there are
    the rest of the children." The children now jump out and they
    and their mother begin to run home; the witch runs after them,
    and whoever she catches becomes witch, while the witch becomes
    the eldest daughter.</p>

    <h3>The Ants and the Grasshopper</h3>

    <p>Lots are drawn in order to decide who shall be the
    grasshopper; the ants then seat themselves in a circle, while
    the grasshopper writes on a piece of paper the name of a grain
    or food which a grasshopper might be supposed to like. He puts
    this in his pocket and then addresses the ants:</p>

    <p>"Dear friends, I am very hungry; would any of you kindly
    give me some food?"</p>

    <p>"I have nothing but a grain of barley," says the ant spoken
    to.</p>

    <p>"Thank you; that is of no use to me," replies the
    grasshopper, and goes on to the next player. As soon as any one
    offers the grain of food which the grasshopper has written down
    the paper must be produced, and the one who guessed the word
    pays a forfeit and becomes grasshopper. If no one guesses the
    word, the grasshopper pays a forfeit.</p>

    <p>The game then goes on in the same way, except that a
    different question is asked on the second round.</p>

    <p>"Neighbors," says the grasshopper, "I have eaten abundantly
    and would have a dance. Which would you recommend?"</p>

    <p>A waltz, a polka, a quadrille, etc., are suggested, and when
    this question has gone the round, the grasshopper asks what
    music he can dance to, and the ants suggest the music of the
    violin, the piano, cornet, etc. Then the grasshopper says he is
    tired of dancing and wishes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> for a bed, and the ants offer
       him moss, straw, grass, and so on, to lie upon.</p>

    <p>"I should sleep very comfortably," the grasshopper says,
    "but I am in fear of being pounced upon by a hungry bird. What
    bird have I most reason to fear?" The ants answer: The rook,
    the lark, the cuckoo, etc.</p>

    <p>When the game is ended, the forfeits that have been lost
    must be called.</p>

    <h3>The Magic Whistle</h3>

    <p>All the players but three stand in two rows facing each
    other. One player sits at the end of the two rows, another
    leads a third player into the room and makes him kneel down
    before the player who is seated, and who is called the
    President.</p>

    <p>The President then proceeds to make all sorts of "magic"
    passes over the kneeler's face, back, and hands. While he is
    doing this, the boy who led the victim in fastens a whistle to
    his coat. It must be slung on to a piece of string or tape, and
    fastened very loosely, so that it can be easily grasped and yet
    will not knock against the wearer's back.</p>

    <p>The whistle is then blown by the boy who attached it, and
    the kneeling boy is told to rise and search for the magic
    whistle. The players who stand on each side must hold their
    hands before their mouths and pretend to blow whenever the
    whistle is blown, which must be as often as any one can get a
    chance without being found out.</p>

    <p>The victim will search all along the rows trying to find the
    magic whistle, and it will be some time before he discovers
    that it is pinned to his own coat.</p>

    <h3>A Running Maze</h3>

    <p>Form a long line of children, one behind the other. The
    leader starts running, and is followed by all the rest. They
    must be sharp enough to do exactly as the leader does.</p>

    <p>After running for a moment or two in the ordinary running
    step, the leader changes to a hopping step, then to a marching
    step, quick <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
       id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span> time, then to a marching
       step, slow time, claps and runs with hands on sides, hands
       on shoulders, hands behind, etc.</p>

    <p>Finally, the leader runs slowly round and round into the
    center, and can either wind the children up tightly or can turn
    them on nearing the center and run out again. For another
    change the long line can start running and so unwind the
    spiral.</p>

    <h3>The Coach and Four</h3>

    <p>Two children stand hand-in-hand, side by side. These are the
    front horses. Two others, close behind, stand also hand-in-hand
    and side by side. These are the back horses.</p>

    <p>Slip reins over the left arm of one of the front horses, and
    over the right arm of the other. The two back horses hold on
    the reins, standing inside them. A driver must then be chosen,
    who gathers up the reins in his left hand and in his right hand
    holds a whip.</p>

    <p>Running beside him, equipped with a horn and parcels and
    letters, is another child, who acts as guard or conductor. The
    rest of the children form village streets, by standing in rows
    facing one another.</p>

    <p>The coach and four, with the driver and guard, gallop about
    the room and through the villages, the guard blowing his horn
    and tossing out a paper or letter here and there.</p>

    <p>Change horses every now and then, so that all may have a
    turn at being horses. A change of driver and guard, too, is
    also much appreciated.</p>

    <p>When the children have had about enough of this game, start
    a cheer as the coach dashes through the villages for the last
    time. Two coaches greatly add to the fun and enjoyment, as they
    have to pass and repass each other.</p>

    <h3>Malaga Raisins</h3>

    <p>The players sit in a circle, and one who is acquainted with
    the trick takes a small stick in his right hand, makes some
    funny movements with it, and then, having taken it in his left
    hand, passes it to his neighbor, saying: "Malaga raisins are
    very good raisins, but I like Valencias better." He then tells
    his neighbor to do the same. Should
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"
       id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span> any of the players pass on
       the stick with the right hand, they must pay a forfeit, but
       of course they must not be told what mistake they have made
       until the stick has been passed right round the circle.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Sally Water</h3>

    <p>This game can be played by any number of children. A ring is
    formed in which all join with the exception of one little girl,
    who kneels in the center of the ring. The children then dance
    round her, singing the following verses:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Sally, Sally Water, sprinkle in the pan,</p>

            <p>Rise, Sally, rise, Sally, for a young man;</p>

            <p>Choose for the best and choose for the worst,</p>

            <p>And choose the very one you love best.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Now you're married I wish you joy,</p>

            <p>First a girl and then a boy;</p>

            <p>Seven years after, son and daughter,</p>

            <p>Pray, young couple, come kiss together."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">

             alt="" /></a>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"
       id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>

    <p>When they come to the words, "Rise, Sally!" the child in the
    center rises and chooses another from the ring. The next two
    lines are then sung, and the two children in the ring dance
    round and kiss. Sally then joins the ring, the second child
    remaining in the circle, and the game is continued as before
    until all the players have acted the part of Sally.</p>

    <h3>Pigeon-House Game</h3>

    <p>Make a ring of children. In the center place five or six of
    the smaller children of the party. This forms the pigeon-house
    and pigeons.</p>

    <p>Now choose one child (boy or girl) to open or shut this
    old-fashioned dovecote.</p>

    <p>He runs round the ring outside and gently pushes the
    children in toward the center, and close to the pigeons, who
    are sitting on the ground softly cooing (or not, just as they
    please).</p>

    <p>This done he moves back. Let him be called the farmer or the
    farmer's boy, if a name is wanted.</p>

    <p>A pretty and lively tune is now started on the piano.
    Directly it begins, the boy runs forward and pulls open the
    ring of children, which widens out with raised arms, to form
    pigeon-holes.</p>

    <p>The pigeons rise to their feet and fly out of these holes,
    round and round the room.</p>

    <p>As the music begins to stop and die away, the pigeons should
    return to their dovecote, and when the last note sounds they
    should all be settled again. The farmer's boy now runs round
    the ring, closing it in and making all safe for the night.</p>

    <p>This game can be played without music, and the elder
    children can take their turn at being pigeons.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Oats and Beans and Barley</h3>

    <p>All the children form a ring with the exception of one
    player, who stands in the center. The children then dance round
    this one, singing the first three lines of the verses given
    below. At the fourth line they stop dancing and act the words
    that are sung. They pretend
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
       id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span> to scatter seed; they stand
       at ease, stamp their feet, clap their hands, and at the
       words: "Turn him round," each child turns round.</p>

    <p>They then again clap hands and dance round, and when the
    words, "Open the ring and take one in," are sung, the center
    child chooses a partner, who steps into the ring, and the two
    stand together while the other children sing the remaining
    verse, after which the child who was first in the center joins
    the ring and the game is continued as before.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">

    <p>One child represents the miller, the rest stand round him in
    a circle, and all dance round and sing the verses. When it
    comes to the spelling part of the rhyme, the miller points to a
    child, who must call out the right letter.</p>

    <p>Any one who makes a mistake must pay a forfeit.</p>

    <h3>Lubin Loo</h3>

    <p>This game can be played by any number of children. The
    players form a ring by clasping hands; they then dance round
    singing the first verse, which after the second verse serves as
    a chorus.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Here we dance lubin, loo,</p>

            <p>On a Saturday night."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>While singing the second verse, the children stop, unclasp
    their hands and suit their actions to the words contained in
    the verse.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"I put my right hand in,</p>

    </div>

    <p>Each child while singing this first stretches her right arm
    toward the center of the ring, then draws the same arm back as
    far as possible, next shakes or swings her right hand, and when
    the last line is sung she turns right round. The children then
    once more join hands, and commence dancing, at the same time
    singing the chorus. The game proceeds as before until all the
    verses have been sung. Here are the remaining

    <h3>The Little Lady</h3>

    <p>For this game a number of pieces of rolled-up paper to
    represent horns are required. Whoever makes a mistake in the
    game has a horn stuck in her hair; or, if little boys are
    playing, the horns might be stuck behind the ears.</p>

    <p>The leader of the game begins by saying to her right hand
    neighbor: "Good morning, pretty lady, always pretty; I, a
    pretty lady, always pretty, come from that pretty lady, always
    pretty" (here she points to the girl on her left), "to tell you
    that she owns an eagle with a golden beak."</p>

    <p>The next player turns to her right-hand neighbor, saying:
    "Good morning, pretty lady, always pretty; I, a pretty lady,
    always pretty, come from that pretty lady, always pretty" (here
    she points to the last speaker), "to tell you that she owns an
    eagle with a golden beak and silver claws."</p>

    <p>The next girl continues the story word for word, adding "a
    rare skin." The next adds "diamond eyes," and the next "purple
    feathers." If there are a great number of children, other
    charms must be added to the eagle, but each child must say the
    whole of the story, and for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
       id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> each mistake made she
       receives a paper horn, which must be stuck somewhere about
       the head. At the end of the game a forfeit must be paid for
       each of these horns.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>"Birds Fly"</h3>

    <p>This is a very simple game. Each player places a finger on
    the table, which he must-raise whenever the conductor of the
    game says: "Birds fly," "Pigeons fly," or any other winged
    creates "fly."</p>

    <p>If he names any creature without wings, such as "Pigs fly,"
    and any player thoughtlessly raises his finger, that player
    must pay a forfeit, as he must also do if he omits to raise his
    finger when a winged creature is named.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>I Say Stoop</h3>

    <p>Teacher says to the class: "I say stoop."</p>

    <p>Upon the word stoop all the children must stoop. If they do
    not they must be seated. The teacher must say "I say stand."
    The children must stand. If they do not they must be
    seated.</p>

    <p>This game will cause the children to think quickly, and to
    act quickly.</p>

    <p>The teacher can say: "I say fold the hands behind the
    back.</p>

    <p>"I say take a deep breath of air."</p>

    <p>"I say hands on hips."</p>

    <p>"I say raise the arms over the head."</p>

    <p>Anything else may be substituted; those who are slow to act
    and think must be seated.</p>

    <p>The one who remains standing the longest wins.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Flag Race</h3>

    <p>Players seated at desks. Rows need not be full, but there
    must be same number in each row. Choose a player to stand in
    front of each row to hold the flag, and another to stand at the
    rear of each row. At the signal the rear player of each row
    rises, runs to the front,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> takes the flag from the one
       holding it, carries it to the one standing at the rear, and
       takes his seat. As soon as he is seated the next player goes
       and takes the flag back to the player in front. This
       continues till all have run. Be sure that no team has an
       unfair advantage because of the positions taken by the flag
       holders.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Squirrel and Nut</h3>

    <p>Players all seated, but one, heads on desks and eyes
    covered, one hand open on desk with palm up. The odd player is
    a squirrel and passes up and down between the rows and puts a
    nut in the hand of some player.... This one rises and chases
    the squirrel. If the squirrel is caught before he can reach his
    own seat, the one who caught him becomes squirrel; if the
    squirrel is not caught, he can be squirrel again.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Racing and Counting Scores</h3>

    <p>Make a scoreboard on the blackboard, indicating each row by
    a number of letter. Players run as in "Racing" (First Grade,
    First Half Year). Have front players run, tag front wall and
    return to seats, sit erect; mark score; others in a similar
    manner. Repeat, runners tagging rear wall. See which row has
    largest score.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>School-room Basket Ball</h3>

    <p>Place a basket in the front seat of the second row and
    another in the front seat of next to last row. Draw a throwing
    line on floor 20 feet from each basket. At some time beforehand
    choose four captains and have these captains choose teams,
    choosing in turn. Teams stand at least two rows apart and
    behind throwing line, each team having a ball. Captains stand
    beyond baskets, two captains at same basket. Each captain
    passes the ball in turn to his players and they throw for the
    basket. Team throwing the most baskets in a round wins one
    point, first to get five points wins the contest.</p>

    <h3>Last Man</h3>

    <p>Players seated at desks. Rows playing must be full rows. The
    game is much like "Fox and Squirrel" (see First Grade, Second
    Half Year). One player is "it," and there is one runner,
    besides the full rows of seats. The runner may come to the
    front of any row and call "Last Man," and then each player in
    that row must move back one place, leaving the front seat for
    the runner, who is now safe. The last one in the rear of the
    row will be out of a place and thus becomes runner. When a
    runner is tagged, he is "it," and the one who caught him
    becomes runner and must get out of the way at once.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Changing Seats</h3>

    <p>Players seated at desks. When teacher commands "Change
    right," all move one place to right and the right hand row
    stands. In like manner the command may be "Change front,"
    "Change back," or "Change left." At first it is best to follow
    each change by the reverse, so as to allow those standing to
    get seats, but later they may be told that they must run to the
    vacant seats on the opposite side or end of the room. Leaders
    may be chosen to act in place of the teacher.</p>

    <h3>Huckle, Buckle, Beanstalk</h3>

    <p>The children close their eyes and put their heads on their
    desks. A small object&mdash;a thimble or button&mdash;is placed
    in plain sight. At a signal, the children move about the room,
    and when they see it, take their seats without making any sign
    of its whereabouts. The first one to see it may hide it the
    next time.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Blackboard Relay</h3>

    <p>This is like the blackboard relay played in the third grade,
    but instead of marks and letters, words must be written; these
    may be required to form a sentence, numbers may be written and
    afterwards added, subtracted, etc., by the succeeding players,
    or each player may <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"
       id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span> write his own name. It is
       often interesting to have the last player required to erase
       all his team has written, or each child may erase his own
       writing, passing the eraser as he did the chalk.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Hide the Thimble</h3>

    <p>One child goes out of the room. A thimble or button is
    placed in plain sight by another child. The one who was sent
    out is then guided to the object by the clapping of the
    children&mdash;soft clapping for "cold," and louder for
    "warm."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Suggestive Breathing Work</h3>

    <p>1. March winds whistling through the trees. Inhale a deep
    breath and imitate the wind.</p>

    <p>2. Keeping a feather in the air. Run with head back and blow
    short breaths, keeping an imaginary feather from falling to the
    ground.</p>

    <p>3. Making Ocean Waves. By blowing the water in a large
    basin.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Fox Chase</h3>

    <p>Four farmers are in their home in the country enjoying a
    quiet evening.</p>

    <p>They hear a sound outside, they watch and listen and decide
    that the foxes are near the cabin. They wait until they are
    very close, then give chase&mdash;and catch as many as they can
    before the foxes have reached their home in the forest. All
    caught become farmers and help to catch the rest.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Poison</h3>

    <p>The players join hands to form a circle. About ten erasers
    are placed in the center of the circle, with spaces between
    them through which a player might step. The players then try by
    means of pushing or pulling their comrades by means of clasped
    hands, to make them <span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
       id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span> knock over the erasers. Any
       player who knocks over an eraser or who unclasps hands must
       take his seat, the erasers again being replaced. The first
       players so leaving the circle form a scrub circle. The
       player wins who remains longest in the first circle.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Slap-Jack</h3>

    <p>All the pupils are seated except one. The odd player walks
    or runs through the aisles, touching some player, and runs
    around the room in the direction he is going. The one touched
    immediately leaves his seat, and runs around the room in the
    opposite direction. The first one back in the empty seat
    wins.</p>

    <p>Dodging through the aisles to shorten the distance is not
    allowed. The run must be around the outside of the room.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Crow's Race</h3>

    <p>All players form in a straight line. Grasp just above ankles
    and on "Go," run a very short distance and return, keeping hold
    above ankles all the time.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Riding the Bicycle</h3>

    <p>Hands in position in front, as though grasping the
    handle-bars, running in place with lifting the knee high and
    pointing toe to the ground. The same movement, traveling
    forward with short, quick steps.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Cat and Rat</h3>

    <p>Children form a circle around the room, with hands joined. A
    "cat" is chosen to stand outside the circle, a "rat" to stand
    inside. The players are friends of the rat, and raise their
    arms to let him under, but keep them down when the cat tries to
    get through. The cat chases the rat in and out of the circle,
    among desks and over seats, till the "rat" is caught, when a
    new cat and rat are chosen.</p>

    <h3>Jumping the Rope</h3>

    <p>This makes a splendid combination exercise. Swing the arms
    in a large circle, as though swinging the rope, and jump each
    time that the rope comes down. Travel forward with the same
    exercises, jumping and landing on one foot instead of both.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Teacher</h3>

    <p>The children stand or sit in one line. One is teacher and he
    or she throws a bean bag or soft ball in rotation down the
    line, the child missing goes to the front. When the teacher
    misses he or she goes to the foot and the child at the head
    becomes teacher. No bad or swift throws are counted.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Bird-Catcher</h3>

    <p>This game is a great favorite with all the children, even in
    the upper grades. Two players are chosen as bird-catchers, and
    stand in one corner of the room. The "mother-bird" is chosen to
    stand in another "nest" in the other front corner of the room.
    The other players are named in groups (those in one row of
    seats usually) for various birds, "robins," "wrens," etc. As
    the name of each group of birds is called, they go to the back
    of the room, and, at a signal, run to the "mother-bird's nest."
    The bird-catchers try to catch them before they reach it. The
    "birds" dodge in and out among the desks, jumping over the
    seats, etc. The mother-bird and bird-catchers count their birds
    at the end of the game, and all "fly" back to their seats; that
    is, wave their arms and skip to their seats.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Tag Me, or Heads Up</h3>

    <p>The pupils, upon the command of the player who is the leader
    and stands in front of the class, fold their arms upon the desk
    and lower the head upon the arms. The leader has an eraser or
    other article which he places upon one of the desks. He
    commands "Heads up" and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> pupils raise their heads.
       The one finding the eraser on his seat rises and chases the
       leader. If he catches him he becomes the leader; if not, the
       first one is again the leader. If they fail to catch him
       after two trials he chooses another leader.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>An Eraser Game</h3>

    <p>A boy places a rubber eraser, or any small object, on the
    desk of a girl. She takes the eraser and chases him around the
    room to his seat. If she tags him, he goes to the corner to
    stand, with others who are caught, till the end of the game.
    The girl then puts the eraser on a boy's desk, and the game
    continues.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Circle Ball</h3>

    <p>Children stand in a circle around the room; one stands in
    the center, with a bean bag or ball, and makes quick throws to
    children in different parts of the circle.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Seat Tag&mdash;A School-room Game</h3>

    <p>The one starting the game runs and tags someone near and
    gets to that child's seat as quickly as he can. The child tries
    to tag him on the way. If he tags him the one tagged must go in
    the mush pot, that is, to go to the front of the room and sit
    down. The one who caught him continues the game, and when
    another one gets in the mush pot the first one is permitted to
    take his seat. The game continues until all have had a run.</p>

    <p>The runs should all be very short to make the game go
    quickly.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Dead Ball</h3>

    <p>Children stand by desks. A tennis or soft rubber ball is
    thrown among the players. The child hit sits and is out of the
    game. The child standing near where the ball falls throws it
    the next time.</p>
    <hr class="short" />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>

    <h3>Preliminary Ball</h3>

    <p>Children stand in rows, facing each other, two rows of desks
    between them, those on one side having bean bags. On the
    teacher's counts they throw to those in the row opposite,
    throwing and catching with both hands. After a given number of
    throws, they put the left hand behind them, throwing and
    catching with the right hand; the same with the left hand. This
    is good muscular training.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Dodge</h3>

    <p>Players divide into equal groups. One group forms a circle,
    the other within. Outside group has a volley or an outdoor
    baseball with which they try to hit the one's (players) within.
    As soon as one is hit he must immediately join the circle and
    help hit the others. When all have been tagged in this way,
    groups change places and repeat. The two players who were last
    to be hit in the two games are captains to choose up for the
    next time.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Third Man</h3>

    <p>Played much like "Three Deep." Players stand in couples,
    facing each other, couples scattered in any way around the
    room. The runner is free from being tagged when he steps
    between the two players of any couple, and the chaser must
    chase the one toward whom the runner turns his back.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Fox and Chickens</h3>

    <p>Choose a player to be fox and another to be the mother hen.
    The players are the chickens and all form in a line behind the
    mother hen, and each one grasping the waist of the one in
    front. The fox tries to tag the last chicken; the line, led by
    the mother hen, turns and tries to keep between the fox and
    that chicken. When the last chicken is tagged he becomes fox,
    and the mother hen chooses another player in her place.</p>

       id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>

    <h3>Eraser Relay</h3>

    <p>Place an eraser on the front desk of alternate rows. At a
    signal to start the first child in each row takes the eraser in
    both hands and passes it over his head to the child behind him.
    This continues till the last child receives it. The last child
    runs forward with it, running down the right aisle. On reaching
    the front seat, his entire row moves one seat backward, so as
    to leave an empty seat in front. The runner then sits down in
    the empty seat and passes the eraser backward with both hands
    as before stated.</p>

    <p>The changing of seats should be on the left side.</p>

    <p>The game ends when each child is returned to his own
    seat.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>School-room Tag</h3>

    <p>Mark a circle on floor in front of desks. Choose a player to
    be "it." He stands near but not in the circle and calls the
    names of three players. The players must rise and try to reach
    the circle without being tagged. They run in any style in
    either direction.</p>

    <p>The first one tagged is "it" and the game continues as
    before. If none are caught, three more are named. Encourage
    naming players who have not been called.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Serpentine Maze</h3>

    <p>Players all in single file, teacher leading. Each player
    reaches right hand forward to player next in front and left
    hand back, grasping hands. March forward, circling to left and
    winding up into a spiral. When tightly wound, last player
    should lead, all turn about to left and wind up, circling to
    right. Several variations should be used later:</p>

    <p>1. Same as first method without grasping hands.</p>

    <p>2. When wound as far as possible and leave enough space,
    teach circles right from center of spiral and line follows,
    passing out in a reverse spiral; this is done first grasping
    hands and later without.</p>

    <p>3. When leader reaches center of spiral, tight wound, she
    signals <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"
       id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span> to players in some
       direction and they lift arms, forming arches, under which
       the line may pass, teacher leading, hands are kept grasped
       in this case.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Teacher and Class</h3>

    <div class="figcenter"

    </div>

    <p>Similar to "School Ball." A leader is chosen for each group
    of eight or ten players, the players in a line and the leader
    eight or ten feet away at the side. A row in the school-room
    may be taken as a group, with a leader standing in front. The
    leader tosses the ball or bean bag to the players in turn,
    beginning at the head. Any player missing goes to the foot. If
    the leader misses he goes to the foot and the one at the head
    becomes leader. If the ball goes twice around and the leader
    does not miss, he goes in the line just above those who have
    missed and the head player becomes leader.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Blackboard Relay</h3>

    <p>The competing rows must be placed where there is a
    blackboard at the front of each row. First player of each row
    has a piece of chalk. At the signal he runs to the board and
    makes a mark with the chalk, then he returns to his seat, and
    hands the chalk to the next player,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
       id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span> who runs and marks in his
       turn. Later, players may be required to make a cross,
       circles, capital letters, small letters, add columns of
       numbers, write words, construct sentences. The teacher is
       the judge as to whether the marks come up to the
       requirements, and each team is charged with a foul for each
       defect.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Tag the Wall Relay</h3>

    <p>This is like "Racing" (See First Grade), but more
    continuous. Two or more rows compete. The player in the back
    seat rises at a signal from the teacher, runs forward down the
    aisle, tags the wall at the front of the room, and returns to
    his seat. As soon as he has reached his seat the player next in
    front of him does the same, the relay being complete when each
    player in turn has run. The line whose front player is seated
    first wins.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Slow Poke (Indoors)</h3>

    <p>Alternate rows of children are chosen. On a signal from the
    teacher, the last children in the alternate rows, run down the
    aisles, turn to their left; run down the other aisle, turn on
    reaching their seats, and tag the person who sits in front of
    them. The person tagged does as the first person did, tagging
    the person in front only when he reaches his starting place.
    Each person running when tagged. Equal numbers should be chosen
    for each row. The object of the game is to see which row is the
    winner, depending entirely upon alertness, quickness of mind
    and honesty in playing with fellow students.</p>

    <h2>TRICKS AND PUZZLES</h2>

    <p>Any one who wishes to play a trick or show off a puzzle
    should test it privately, before attempting to show it before
    company, for often, owing to some slight error, the trick may
    at first prove a failure, whereas a little practice will soon
    make one perfect.</p>

    <h3>The Dancing Egg</h3>

    <p>Get a hard-boiled egg and place it on the reverse side of a
    smooth polished plate or bread-platter. If you now turn the
    plate round while holding it in a horizontal position, the egg,
    which is in the middle of it, will turn round also, and as the
    pace is quickened, the egg will move more and more quickly,
    until it stands up on one end and spins round like a top. In
    order to be quite sure that the experiment will succeed, you
    should keep the egg upright while it is being boiled, so that
    the inside may be hardened in the proper position.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Magic Thread</h3>

    <p>Soak a piece of thread in a solution of salt or alum (of
    course, your audience must not know you have done this). When
    dry, borrow a very light ring and fix it to the thread. Apply
    the thread to the flame of a candle; it will burn to ashes, but
    will still support the ring.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Swimming Needles</h3>

    <p>There are several ways of making a needle float on the
    surface of the water.</p>

    <p>The simplest way is to place a piece of tissue paper on the
    water and lay the needle on it; the paper soon becomes soaked
    with water and sinks to the bottom, while the needle is left
    floating on the top.</p>

    <p>Another method is to hang the needle in two slings made of
    threads, which must be carefully drawn away as soon as the
    needle floats.</p>

    <p>You can also make the needle float by simply holding it in
    your fingers and laying it on the water. This, however,
    requires a very steady hand.</p>

    <p>If you magnetize a sewing-needle by rubbing it on a fairly
    strong magnet and float it on the water, it will make an
    extremely sensitive compass; and if you place two needles on
    the water at the same time, you will see them slowly approach
    each other until they float side by side, that is, if they do
    not strike together so heavily as to cause them to sink.</p>

    <h3>The Bridge of Knives</h3>

    <p>Three knives may be supported by their handles in the
    following manner: Place three glasses in a triangle, each side
    of which must be about the length of one of the knives. The
    blade of the first knife should rest on the blade of the
    second, by passing over it near to the point where the handle
    and blade are joined; the blade of the second passing in the
    same manner over the blade of the third, which is to be made to
    rest on the blade of the first. The handles being then
    carefully placed upon the glasses, a bridge is formed strong
    enough to bear a considerable weight.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>To Balance a Coffee-Cup on the Point of a Knife</h3>

    <p>The articles necessary for the performance of this trick are
    very simple, a dinner-fork and an ordinary sized cork being all
    that are needed. Fix the cork firmly in the handle of the fork,
    then stick the fork into it so that two prongs shall be on each
    side of the cup handle, and slope the fork in such a way that
    its handle will come under the bottom of the cup. The heaviest
    weight being thus brought underneath, you can hold the cup on
    the point of a knife, if you very carefully find the exact
    place on which it will balance.</p>

    <p>As the surface of the cup is usually glazed, the hand which
    holds the knife must not tremble, or the cup will slip off.</p>

    <p>You may also obtain the same result by using two knives
    instead of a fork.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Obstinate Cork</h3>

    <p>Take a small cork and ask some one to blow it into a fairly
    large sized, ordinary bottle that has a neck.</p>

    <p>This seems to be quite an easy matter. The one who tries it
    will probably blow as hard as possible upon the little cork;
    but, instead of going into the bottle, as expected, it will
    simply fall down. The harder the puffs or blows, the more
    obstinate the cork will appear to be; and even if the effect of
    blowing gently be tried, it will be of no use; the cork will
    not go into the bottle, much to the amusement of those who
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
       id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span> are watching. The reason
       why the cork will not go in is this: The bottle being
       already full of air, when the cork is blown, more air will
       be forced into the bottle, and consequently the air inside
       will be greatly compressed and will simply force the cork
       back. The following is a simple way of overcoming the
       difficulty: Instead of trying to force the cork through the
       compressed air in the bottle, just the contrary should be
       tried, that is, some of the air should be sucked out of the
       bottle; this being done, the bottle will become partly
       emptied, and when the outside air rushes in to fill up the
       empty space, it will carry the cork with it to the bottom of
       the bottle.</p>

    <h3>Six and Five Make Nine</h3>

    <p>This is a simple little puzzle. Take eleven strips of
    cardboard, lay six of them at exactly equal distances on the
    table, and ask one of the company to add the five other strips
    and yet only make nine. It is done by placing six of them
    parallel to each other&mdash;the others are used to spell out
    the word nine.</p>

    it. Then place a dime in the palm of your hand and tell your
    audience that you can make it vanish at the word of
    command.</p>

    <p>You then close your hand so that the dime sticks to the
    waxed nail. Blow on your hand and make magic passes, and cry
    "Dime, begone!" Open your hand so quickly that no one will see
    the dime <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"
       id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span> stuck to the back of your
       nail, and show your empty hand. To make the dime reappear,

    <p>For this trick, take a piece, two or three inches long, of a
    stem of a clay tobacco pipe, taking care that one end is quite
    even; with a knife or file, work the hole at the even end
    larger, so as to form a little cup. Choose the roundest pea you
    can find, place it in the cup, and blow softly through the
    other end of the pipe, throwing back your head while you blow,
    so that you can hold the pipe in an upright position over your
    mouth.</p>

    <p>The pea will rise, fall and dance in its cup, according to
    the degree of force you use in blowing, but you must take care
    not to blow too hard, or you may blow it away altogether.</p>

    <h3>The Balancing Spoon</h3>

    <p>Place a half-opened penknife on the edge of the table and
    hang a large cooking-spoon by its hook on to the knife, just
    where the blade and handle join. Place the spoon so that its
    inner (concave) side is facing the table and, after swinging
    for a little while, the knife and spoon will keep still in
    perfect balance. Even if you fill the spoon with sand it will
    not fall, so long as the heaviest point is under the edge of
    the table.</p>

    <p>The cooking-spoon is hung on to the half-opened penknife
    where the blade and the handle join, and you can now place the
    end of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"
       id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> knife-handle on the tip of
       your finger, on the edge of the table, or on the rim of a
       glass which is standing near the edge of the table, and your
       knife and spoon will balance perfectly, without falling
       over.</p>

    <h3>The Force of a Water-Drop</h3>

    <p>Get a match and make a notch in the middle of it, bend it so
    as to form an acute angle, and place it over the mouth of a
    bottle.</p>

    <p>Now place a dime or other small coin on the match and ask
    any one to get the coin into the bottle without touching either
    the bottle or the match.</p>

    <p>This is very easy to do. Dip your finger in a glass of
    water, hold it over the place where the match is notched, and
    let one or two drops fall on this point. The force of the water
    will cause the sides of the angle to move apart, and the
    opening thus become large enough to let the coin fall into the
    bottle.</p>

    <h3>The Sentinel Egg</h3>

    <p>This trick requires care and patience. You must lay a piece
    of looking-glass on a perfectly even table; then take a
    new-laid egg and shake it about for some time until the white
    is well mixed with the yolk. In this condition it is possible
    to balance the egg on its end and make it stand upright on the
    glass. This trick is more certain to be successful if you are
    clever enough to flatten the end ever so slightly and evenly,
    by giving it a gentle and unsuspected tap.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Coin Trick</h3>

    <p>Take a coin in each hand and stretch out your arms as far
    apart as you can. Then tell your audience that you will make
    both coins pass into one hand without bringing your hands
    together. This is easily done by placing one coin upon the
    table and then turning your body round until the hand with the
    other coin comes to where it lies. You can then easily pick the
    coin up, and both will be in one hand, while your arms are
    still widely extended.</p>

    <h3>The Wonderful Pendulum</h3>

    <p>If you fill a wineglass with water and place a thick piece
    of paper over it so that no air can get in, you will find that
    you can turn the glass upside down without spilling a drop of
    water, because the pressure of the air on the outside will keep
    the paper from falling off. It is on this principle that the
    present pendulum is to be made. Take a piece of cardboard
    larger than the mouth of the glass; pass a cord through a small
    hole in the center of the card, and fasten it by means of a
    knot on the under side, then carefully cover the hole with wax,
    so that no air may get in.</p>

    <p>Place your cardboard over the glass full of water, and by
    making a loop in the end of the cord you can hang the glass
    from a hook in the ceiling without any fear of its falling off.
    In order to make sure that no air can get into the glass, it is
    wise to smear the rim with tallow before laying the cardboard
    on.</p>

    <h3>The Revolving Pins</h3>

    <p>Take a piece of elastic which is not covered with silk or
    wool, and through the middle of this stick a pin, which you
    have bent as shown in the illustration.</p>

    <p>Now hold the elastic between the thumb and first finger of
    each hand and twirl it round, stretching it a little at the
    same time. The rapid movement thus caused will make the
    revolving pin look like a glass object, and if you have a
    strong light falling on the pin and a dark background behind
    it, the resemblance becomes very much stronger.</p>

    <p>After a little practice you will be able to represent many
    things in this way&mdash;cheese dishes, vases, champagne
    glasses, etc.; and if the bent pin should fall into a
    horizontal position while revolving, on account of its shape,
    you can tie one end to the elastic with a piece of white
    thread, which will not in any way interfere with the
    working.</p>

    <p>This trick looks well in a darkened room, when the pin is
    illuminated by a ray of sunlight coming through a hole in the
    window shutter.</p>

    <h3>The Mysterious Ball</h3>

    <p>This seems to be a plain wooden ball with a hole bored in
    its center, through which a string is passed. The ball will
    move lightly up and down this cord, but let some one who knows
    the trick take the string in his hand and it becomes quite a
    different matter; the ball will move quickly, or slowly, at
    command, and, if told to do so, will stand still until ordered
    to move on again.</p>

    <p>The reason for this peculiar behavior is that inside the
    ball there are two holes, one of which is quite straight, while
    the other is curved, and turns out of the straight hole.</p>

    <p>It is through this curved passage that the cord is passed,
    and you can easily see that to regulate the movements of the
    ball, it is only necessary to hold the string more or less
    tightly. If you hold the cord perfectly tight, the ball will
    not be able to move at all. The ball can be purchased at any
    top shop.</p>

    <h3>The Man with His Head the Wrong Way</h3>

    <p>Put on a coat and vest so that they fasten behind. Then fix
    a mask over the back of the head and a wig over the face. The
    effect is very curious.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>To Find an Object While Blindfolded</h3>

    <p>To play this trick, you must take one of your friends into
    your confidence. Borrow a watch and put it in your pocket, and
    then ask your audience to sit at the end of the room, blindfold
    your friend, and lead him outside. Now say: "Ladies and
    gentlemen, if you will give me some small object to hide, I
    promise that the blind man will find it, although I shall not
    even tell him what he is to look for, and I shall lower the
    gas, so that if the bandage should slip, he will still be
    unable to see." A key, pencil, or any small thing having been
    handed to you, lower the gas and proceed to hide the object, at
    the end of the room, mentioning where you have put it, but not
    mentioning that you have placed the watch close beside it. You
    then request "Silence" and lead in the blind man and ask him to
    begin his search. He is guided, of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
       id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> course, by the ticking of
       the watch, and knows that whatever he finds close to it is
       the object hidden. When he calls "Found," he must slip the
       watch into his pocket. You then turn up the gas and quietly
       ask your audience if they do not think your friend is a very
       clever fellow?</p>

    <h3>Chinese Shadows</h3>

    <p>Here is a simple way of making shadow pictures: Place a
    candle on the table and fix a piece of white paper on the wall
    at the same height from the ground as the light is. Now place
    some non-transparent object, as, for instance, a large book,
    between the candle and the paper, and on one side of the table
    place a mirror so that it will reflect the light of the candle
    on to the paper on the wall. If you now put little cardboard
    figures between the candle and the mirror, a shadow will be
    thrown on the white paper and you can move your figures about
    just as you please.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Hand Shadows</h3>

    <p>It is very difficult to explain how these shadows should be
    made, but you must bear in mind the fact that it is necessary
    to stand between the lamp and the wall, and extend your arms so
    that the shadow of your body does not interfere with the
    picture shadows you intend to make with your hands. The
    illustrations given will show you how to make two very good
    shadow pictures, but the fun of the game is for several people
    to make up pictures of their own, and see who can succeed in
    making the best.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Game of Shadows</h3>

    <p>For this game you require a white sheet to be hung up at the
    end of the room. Then the "shadow-makers" take up their places
    on low stools behind the sheet. There must be only one lamp in
    the room, which should be placed about six or seven feet behind
    the "shadow-makers." Then the "shadow-makers" drape themselves
    with shawls, or anything handy, and take their places so that
    their shadows are <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
       id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> thrown upon the sheet. They
       must, of course, try to disguise themselves, so that the
       "shadow-seekers" may not be able to guess their identity. By
       loosening the hair and letting it fall over the face, a girl
       may appear like a man with a beard; bending the finger over
       the nose gives one a very queer-looking hooked nose in the
       shadow, and entirely alters the appearance of the face.
       Covering one's self up in a sheet and then extending the
       arms gives one the appearance of a large bat. As soon as a
       "shadow-maker's" identity has been guessed he must take his
       place as a "shadow-seeker," and the one who guessed him
       becomes a "shadow-maker." The penalty of a glance behind the
       sheet on the part of the "shadow-seeker" is to pay a
       forfeit.</p>

    <h3>Think of a Number</h3>

    <p>Tell some one to think of any number he likes, but not to
    tell you what it is. Tell him then to double it. When he has
    done that, let him add an even number to it, which you must
    give him. After doing this, he must halve the whole, then from
    what is left, take away the number he first thought of. When
    this is completed, if he has counted correctly, you will be
    able to give him the exact remainder, which will simply be the
    half of the even number you told him to add to his own.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Living Shadows</h3>

    <p>In order to make these, you must stand in the corner of the
    room, near a mirror. Let some one hold a light behind you, so
    that the shadow of your head and shoulders will be thrown upon
    the wall, and also that the reflected light from the mirror
    will fall at exactly the same spot as the shadow of your
    head.</p>

    <p>If the mirror is now covered with a piece of thick paper,
    from which two eyes, a nose, and a mouth are cut out, the
    effect shown in the drawing will be produced. In order to make
    the shadow still more lifelike, cut out two pieces of paper,
    fasten one over the mirror, and move the other over it. In this
    way the eyes and mouth of the shadow may be made to move.</p>

    <h3>To Guess the Two Ends of a Line of Dominoes</h3>

    <p>For this trick a whole set of dominoes is required, the
    performer taking care to hide one of the set, not a double, in
    his pocket. The remaining dominoes should be shuffled, and
    placed according to the ordinary rules of domino games, and the
    performer undertakes to tell, without seeing them, the two
    numbers forming the extremes of the line, set during his
    absence from the room. The numbers on the extreme ends of the
    domino line will be exactly the same as the numbers on the
    domino which the performer has in his pocket. If he is asked to
    repeat the trick, he should be sure to change the hidden
    domino, or he may chance to be found out.</p>

    <h3>To Tell the Age of Any Person</h3>

    <p>Prepare a set of cards by making a copy of the tables given
    here. Hand them to the person whose age you wish to ascertain,
    and ask him to name the cards on which his age appears.</p>

    <p>If you then add together the first number on each of the
    cards he names, the total will be the age required.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
