  <h3>HOW TWO LAY IN A CLEFT</h3>

  <p>A girl and a boy lay in a cubby-hole in the north side of the
  cliff overlooking Port Gorey, and watched the goings-on down
  below.</p>

  <p>The sun was tending towards Guernsey and the gulf was filled
  witn golden light. A small brig, unkempt and dirty, was nosing
  towards the rough wooden landing-stage clamped to the opposite
  rocks, as though doubtful of the advisability of attempting its
  closer acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"Mon Gyu, Bern, how I wish they were all at the bottom of the
  sea!" said the girl vehemently.</p>

  <p>"Whe&mdash;e&mdash;e&mdash;w!" whistled the boy, and then with
  a twinkle in his eye,&mdash;"Who's got a new parasol now?"</p>

  <p>"Everybody!&mdash;but it's not that. It's the bustle&mdash;and
  the dirt&mdash;and the noise&mdash;and oh&mdash;everything! You
  can't remember what it was like before these wretched mines
  came&mdash;no dust, no noise, no bustle, no dirty men, no silly
  women, no nothing as it is now. Just Sark as it used to be. And
  now&mdash;! Mon Gyu, yes I wish the sea would break in through
  their nasty tunnels and wash them all away&mdash;pumps and
  engines and houses&mdash;everything!"</p>

  <p>And up on the hillside at the head of the gulf the great
  pumping-engine clacked monotonously "Never! Never! Never!"</p>

  <p>"You've got it bad to-day, Nan," said the boy.</p>

  <p>"I've always got it bad. It makes me sick. It has changed
  everything and everybody&mdash;everybody except mother and you,"
  she added quickly. "Get&mdash;get&mdash;get! Why we hardly used
  to know what money was, and now no one thinks of anything but
  getting all they can. It is sickening."</p>

  <p>"S&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;t!" signalled the boy
  suddenly, at the sound of steps and voices on the cliff outside
  and close at hand.</p>

  <p>"Tom," muttered the boy.</p>

  <p>"And Peter Mauger," murmured the girl, and they both shrank
  lower into their hiding-place.</p>

  <p>It was a tiny natural chamber in the sharp slope of the hill.
  Ages ago the massive granite boulders of the headland, loosened
  and undercut by the ceaseless assaults of wind and weather and
  the deadly quiet fingers of the frost, had come rolling down the
  slope till they settled afresh on new foundations, forming holes
  and crannies and little angular chambers where the splintered
  shoulders met. In time, the soil silted down and covered their
  asperities, and&mdash;like a good colonist&mdash;carrying in
  itself the means of increase, it presently brought forth and
  blossomed, and the erstwhile shattered rocks were royally robed
  in russet and purple, and green and gold.</p>

  <p>Among these fantastic little chambers Nance had played as a
  child, and had found refuge in them from the persecutions of her
  big half-brother, Tom Hamon. Tom was six when she was
  born&mdash;fourteen accordingly when she was at the teasable age
  of eight, and unusually tempting as a victim by reason of her
  passionate resentment of his unwelcome attentions.</p>

  <p>She hated Tom, and Tom had always resented her and her
  mother's intrusion into the family, and Bernel's, when he came,
  four years after Nance.</p>

  <p>What his father wanted to marry again for, Tom never could
  make out. His lack of training and limited powers of expression
  did not indeed permit him any distinct reasoning on the matter,
  but the feeling was there&mdash;a dull resentment which found its
  only vent and satisfaction in stolid rudeness to his stepmother
  and the persecution of Nance and Bernel whenever occasion
  offered.</p>

  <p>The household was not therefore on too happy a footing.</p>

  <p>It consisted, at the time when our story opens, of&mdash;Old
  Mrs. Hamon&mdash;Grannie&mdash;half of whose life had been lived
  in the nineteenth century and half in the eighteenth. She had
  seen all the wild doings of the privateering and free-trading
  days, and recalled as a comparatively recent event the raiding of
  the Island by the men of Herm, though that happened forty years
  before.</p>

  <p>She was for the most part a very reserved and silent old lady,
  but her tongue could bite like a whip when the need arose.</p>

  <p>She occupied her own dower-rooms in the house, and rarely went
  outside them. All day long she sat in her great arm-chair by the
  window in her sitting-room, with the door wide open, so that she
  could see all that went on in the house and outside it; and in
  the sombre depths of her great black silk sun-bonnet&mdash;long
  since turned by age and weather to dusky green&mdash;her watchful
  eyes had in them something of the inscrutable and menacing.</p>

  <p>Her wants were very few, and as her income from her one-third
  of the farm had far exceeded her expenses for more than twenty
  years, she was reputed as rich in material matters as she
  undoubtedly was in common-sense and worldly wisdom. Even young
  Tom was sulkily silent before her on the rare occasions when they
  came into contact.</p>

  <p>Next in the family came the nominal head of it, "Old Tom"
  Hamon, to distinguish him from young Tom, his son; a rough, not
  ill-natured man, until the money-getting fever seized him, since
  which time his home-folks had found in him changes that did not
  make for their comfort.</p>

  <p>The discovery of silver in Sark, the opening of the mines, and
  the coming of the English miners&mdash;with all the very
  problematical benefits of a vastly increased currency of money,
  and the sudden introduction of new ideas and standards of life
  and living into a community which had hitherto been contented
  with the order of things known to its forefathers&mdash;these
  things had told upon many, but on none more than old Tom
  Hamon.</p>

  <p>Suspicious at first of the meaning and doings of these
  strangers, he very soon found them advantageous. He got excellent
  prices for his farm produce, and when his horses and carts were
  not otherwise engaged he could always turn them to account
  hauling for the mines.</p>

  <p>As the silver-fever grew in him he became closer in his
  dealings both abroad and at home. With every pound he could
  scrimp and save he bought shares in the mines and believed in
  them absolutely. And he went on scrimping and saving and buying
  shares so as to have as large a stake in the silver future as
  possible.</p>

  <p>He got no return as yet from his investment, indeed. But that
  would come all right in time, and the more shares he could get
  hold of the larger the ultimate return would be. And so he
  stinted himself and his family, and mortgaged his future, in
  hopes of wealth which he would not have known how to enjoy if he
  had succeeded in getting it.</p>

  <p>So possessed was he with the desire for gain that when young
  Tom came home from sea he left the farming to him, and took to
  the mining himself, and worked harder than he had ever worked in
  his life before.</p>

  <p>He was a sturdy, middle-sized man, with a grizzled bullet head
  and rounded beard, of a dogged and pertinacious disposition, but
  capable, when stirred out of his usual phlegm, of fiery outbursts
  which overbore all argument and opposition. His wife died when
  his boy Tom was three, and after two years of lonely discomfort
  he married Nancy Poidestre of Petit Dixcart, whose people looked
  upon it as something of a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i> that she should
  marry out of her own country into Little Sark.</p>

  <p>Nancy was eminently good-looking and a notable housewife, and
  she went into Tom Hamon's house of La Closerie with every hope
  and intention of making him happy.</p>

  <p>But, from the very first, little Tom set his face against
  her.</p>

  <p>It would be hard to say why. Nancy racked her brain for
  reasons, and could find none, and was miserable over it.</p>

  <p>His father thrashed him for his rudeness and insolence, which
  only made matters worse.</p>

  <p>His own mother had given way to him in everything, and spoiled
  him completely. After her death his father out of pity for his
  forlorn estate, had equally given way to him, and only realised,
  too late, when he tried to bring him to with a round turn, how
  thoroughly out of hand he had got.</p>

  <p>When little Tom found, as one consequence of the new mother's
  arrival, that his father thrashed instead of humouring him, he
  put it all down to the new-comer's account, and set himself to
  her discomfiture in every way his barbarous little wits could
  devise.</p>

  <p>He never forgot one awful week he passed in his grandmother's
  care&mdash;a week that terminated in the arrival of still another
  new-comer, who, in course of time, developed into little Nance.
  It is not impossible that the remembrance of that black week
  tended to colour his after-treatment of his little half-sister.
  In spite of her winsomeness he hated her always, and did his very
  best to make life a burden to her.</p>

  <p>When, on that memorable occasion, he was hastily flung by his
  father into his grandmother's room, as the result of some
  wickedness which had sorely upset his stepmother, and the door
  was, most unusually, closed behind him, his first natural impulse
  was to escape as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>But he became aware of something unusual and discomforting in
  the atmosphere, and when his grandmother said sternly, "Sit
  down!" and he turned on her to offer his own opinion on the
  matter, he found the keen dark eyes gazing out at him from under
  the shadowy penthouse of the great black sun-bonnet, with so
  intent and compelling a stare that his mouth closed without
  saying a word. He climbed up on to a chair and twisted his feet
  round the legs by way of anchorage.</p>

  <p>Then he sat up and stared back at Grannie, and as an
  exhibition of nonchalance and high spirit, put out his tongue at
  her.</p>

  <p>Grannie only looked at him.</p>

  <p>And, bit by bit, the tongue withdrew, and only the gaping
  mouth was left, and above it a pair of frightened green eyes,
  transmitting to the perverse little soul within new impressions
  and vague terrors.</p>

  <p>Before long his left arm went up over his face to shut out the
  sight of Grannie's dreadful staring eyes, and when, after a
  sufficient interval, he ventured a peep at her and found her eyes
  still fixed on him, he howled, "Take it off! Take it off!" and
  slipped his anchors and slid to the floor, hunching his back at
  this tormentor who could beat him on his own ground.</p>

  <p>For that week he gave no trouble to any one. But after it he
  never went near Grannie's room, and for years he never spoke to
  her. When he passed her open door, or in front of her window, he
  hunched his shoulder protectively and averted his eyes.</p>

  <p>Resenting control in any shape or form, Tom naturally objected
  to school.</p>

  <p>His stepmother would have had him go&mdash;for his own sake as
  well as hers. But his father took a not unusual Sark view of the
  matter.</p>

  <p>"What's the odds?" said he. "He'll have the farm.
  Book-learning will be no use to him," and in spite of Nancy's
  protests&mdash;which Tom regarded as simply the natural outcrop
  of her ill-will towards him&mdash;the boy grew up untaught and
  uncontrolled, and knowing none but the worst of all
  masters&mdash;himself.</p>

  <p>On occasion, when the tale of provocation reached its limit,
  his father thrashed him, until there came a day when Tom upset
  the usual course of proceedings by snatching the stick out of his
  father's hands, and would have belaboured him in turn if he had
  not been promptly knocked down.</p>

  <p>After that his father judged it best for all concerned that he
  should flight his troublesome wings outside for a while. So he
  sent him off in a trading-ship, in the somewhat forlorn hope that
  a knowledge of the world would knock some of the devil out of
  him&mdash;a hope which, like many another, fell short of
  accomplishment.</p>

  <p>The world knocks a good deal out of a man, but it also knocks
  a good deal in. Tom came back from his voyaging knowing a good

  <h3>HOW NANCE CAME TO BE HERSELF</h3>

  <p>And little Nance?</p>

  <p>The most persistent memories of Nance's childhood were her
  fear and hatred of Tom, and her passionate love for her
  mother,&mdash;and Bernel when he came.</p>

  <p>"My own," she called these two, and regarded even her father
  as somewhat outside that special pale; esteemed Grannie as an
  Olympian, benevolently inclined, but dwelling on a remote and
  loftier plane; and feared and detested Tom as an open enemy.</p>

  <p>And she had reasons.</p>

  <p>She was a high-strung child, too strong and healthy to be
  actually nervous, but with every faculty always at its
  fullest&mdash;not only in active working order but always
  actively at work&mdash;an admirable subject therefore for the
  malevolence of an enemy whose constant proximity offered him
  endless opportunity.</p>

  <p>Much of his boyish persecution never reached the ears of the
  higher powers. Nance very soon came to accept Tom's rough
  treatment as natural from a big fellow of fourteen to a small
  girl of eight, and she bore it stoically and hated him the
  harder.</p>

  <p>Her mother taught her carefully to say her prayers, which
  included petitions for the welfare of Grannie and father and
  brother Tom, and for a time, with the perfunctoriness of
  childhood, which attaches more weight to the act than to the
  meaning of it, she allowed that to pass with a stickle and a
  slur. But very soon brother Tom was ruthlessly dropped out of the
  ritual, and neither threats nor persuasion could induce her to
  re-establish him.</p>

  <p>Later on, and in private, she added to her acknowledged
  petitions an appendix, unmistakably brief and to the
  point&mdash;"And, O God, please kill brother Tom!"&mdash;and
  lived in hope.</p>

  <p>She was an unusually pretty child, though her prettiness
  developed afterwards&mdash;as childish prettiness does not
  always&mdash;into something finer and more lasting.</p>

  <p>She had, as a child, large dark blue eyes, which wore as a
  rule a look of watchful anxiety&mdash;put there by brother Tom.
  To the end of her life she carried the mark of a cut over her
  right eyebrow, which came within an ace of losing her the sight
  of that eye. It was brother Tom did that.</p>

  <p>She had an abundance of flowing brown hair, by which Tom
  delighted to lift her clear off the ground, under threat of
  additional boxed ears if she opened her mouth. The wide, firm
  little mouth always remained closed, but the blue eyes burned
  fiercely, and the outraged little heart, thumping furiously at
  its impotence, did its best to salve its wounds with ceaseless
  repetition of its own private addition to the prescribed form of
  morning and evening prayer.</p>

  <p>Once, even Tom's dull wit caught something of meaning in the
  blaze of the blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"What are you saying, you little devil?" he growled, and
  released her so suddenly that she fell on her knees in the
  mud.</p>

  <p>And she put her hands together, as she was in the habit of
  doing, and prayed, "O God, please kill brother Tom!"</p>

  <p>"Little devil!" said brother Tom, with a startled red face,
  and made a dash at her; but she had foreseen that and was gone
  like a flash.</p>

  <p>One might have expected her childish comeliness to exercise
  something of a mollifying effect on his brutality. On the
  contrary, it seemed but to increase it. She was so sweet; he was
  so coarse. She was so small and fragile; he was so big and
  strong. Her prettiness might work on others. He would let her see
  and feel that he was not the kind to be fooled by such
  things.</p>

  <p>He had the elemental heartlessness of the savage, which
  recognises no sufferings but its own, and refuses to be affected
  even by them.</p>

  <p>When Nance's kitten, presented to her by their neighbour, Mrs.
  Helier Baker, solved much speculation as to its sex by becoming a
  mother, Tom gladly undertook the task of drowning the superfluous
  offspring. He got so much amusement out of it that, for weeks,
  Nance's horrified inner vision saw little blind heads,
  half-drowned and mewing piteously, striving with feeble pink
  claws to climb out of the death-tub and being ruthlessly set
  swimming again till they sank.</p>

  <p>She hurled herself at Tom as he gloated over his enjoyment,
  and would have asked nothing better than to treat him as he was
  treating the kittens&mdash;righteous retribution in her case, not
  enjoyment!&mdash;but he was too strong for her. He simply kicked
  out behind, and before she could get up had thrust one of his
  half-drowned victims into the neck of her frock, and the
  clammy-dead feel of it and its pitiful screaming set her
  shuddering for months whenever she thought of it.</p>

  <p>But now and again her tormentor overpassed the bounds and got
  his reward&mdash;to Nance's immediate satisfaction but subsequent
  increased tribulation. For whenever he got a thrashing on her
  account he never failed to pay her out in the smaller change of
  persecution which never came to light.</p>

  <p>On a pitch-dark, starless night, the high-hedged&mdash;and in
  places deep-sunk&mdash;lanes of Little Sark are as black as the
  inside of an ebony ruler.</p>

  <p>When the moon bathes sea and land in a flood of shimmering
  silver, or on a clear night of stars&mdash;and the stars in Sark,
  you must know, shine infinitely larger and closer and brighter
  than in most other places&mdash;the darkness below is lifted
  somewhat by reason of the majestic width and height of the
  glittering dome above. But when moon and stars alike are wanting,
  then the darkness of a Sark lane is a thing to be felt,
  and&mdash;if you should happen to be a little girl of eight, with
  a large imagination and sharp ears that have picked up fearsome
  stories of witches and ghosts and evil spirits&mdash;to be
  mortally feared.</p>

  <p>Tom had a wholesome dread of such things himself. But the fear
  of fourteen, in a great strong body and no heavenly spark of
  imagination, is not to be compared with the fear of eight and a
  mind that could quiver like a harp even at its own imaginings.
  And, to compass his ends, he would blunt his already dull
  feelings and turn the darkness to his account.</p>

  <p>When he knew Nance was out on such a night&mdash;on some
  errand, or in at a neighbour's&mdash;to crouch in the hedge and
  leap silently out upon her was huge delight; and it was well
  worth braving the grim possibilities of the hedges in order to
  extort from her the anger in the bleat of terror which, as a
  rule, was all that her paralysed heart permitted, as she turned
  and fled.</p>

  <p>Almost more amusing&mdash;as considerably extending the
  enjoyment&mdash;was it to follow her quietly on such occasions,
  yet not so quietly but that she was perfectly aware of footsteps
  behind, which stopped when she stopped and went on again when she
  went on, and so kept her nerves on the quiver the whole time.</p>

  <p>Creeping fearfully along in the blackness, with eyes and ears
  on the strain, and both little shoulders humped against the
  expected apparition of Tom&mdash;or worse, she would become aware
  of the footsteps behind her.</p>

  <p>Then she would stop suddenly to make sure, and stand listening
  painfully, and hear nothing but the low hoarse growl of the sea
  that rarely ceases, day or night, among the rocks of Little
  Sark.</p>

  <p>Then she would take a tentative step or two and stop again,
  and then dash on. And always there behind her were the footsteps
  that followed in the dark.</p>

  <p>Then she would fumble with her foot for a stone and stoop
  hastily&mdash;for you are at a disadvantage with ghosts and with
  Toms when you stoop&mdash;and pick it up and hurl it
  promiscuously in the direction of the footsteps, and quaver, in a
  voice that belied its message, "Go away, Tom Hamon! I can see
  you,"&mdash;which was a little white fib born of the black
  urgency of the situation;&mdash;"and I'm not the least bit
  afraid,"&mdash;which was most decidedly another.</p>

  <p>And so the journey would progress fitfully and in spasms, and
  leave nightmare recollections for the disturbance of one's
  sleep.</p>

  <p>But there were variations in the procedure at times.</p>

  <p>As when, on one occasion, Nance's undiscriminating projectile
  elicited from the darkness a plaintive "Moo!" which came, she
  knew, from her favourite calf Jeanetton, who had broken her
  tether in the field and sought companionship in the road, and had
  followed her doubtfully, stopping whenever she stopped, and so
  received the punishment intended for another.</p>

  <p>Nance kissed the bruise on Jeanetton's ample forehead next day
  very many times, and explained the whole matter to her at
  considerable length, and Jeanetton accepted it all very placidly
  and bore no ill-will.</p>

  <p>Another time, when Nance had taken a very specially compounded
  cake over to her old friend, Mrs. Baker, as a present from her
  mother, and had been kept much longer than she wished&mdash;for
  the old lady's enjoyment of her pretty ways and entertaining
  prattle&mdash;she set out for home in fear and trembling.</p>

  <p>It was one of the pitch-black nights, and she went along on
  tiptoes, hugging the empty plate to her breast, and glancing
  fearfully over first one shoulder, then the other, then over both
  and back and front all at once.</p>

  <p>She was almost home, and very grateful for it, when the
  dreaded black figure leaped silently out at her from its
  crouching place, and she tore down the lane to the house, Tom's
  hoarse guffaws chasing her mockingly.</p>

  <p>The open door cleft a solid yellow wedge in the darkness. She
  was almost into it, when her foot caught, and she flung head
  foremost into the light with a scream, and lay there with the
  blood pouring down her face from the broken plate.</p>

  <p>A finger's-breadth lower and she would have gone through life
  one-eyed, which would have been a grievous loss to humanity at
  large, for sweeter windows to a large sweet soul never shone than
  those out of which little Nance Hamon's looked.</p>

  <p>Most houses may be judged by their windows, but these material
  windows are not always true gauge of what is within. They may be
  decked to deceive, but the clear windows of the soul admit of no
  disguise. That little life tenant is always looking out and
  showing himself in his true colours&mdash;whether he knows it or
  not.</p>

  <p>Nance's terrified scream took old Tom out at a bound. He had
  heard the quick rush of her feet and Tom's mocking laughter in
  the distance. He carried Nance in to her mother, snatched up a
  stick, and went after the culprit who had promptly
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>It was two days before Tom sneaked in again and took his
  thrashing dourly. Little Nance had shut her lips tight when her
  father questioned her, and refused to say a word. But he was
  satisfied as to where the blame lay and administered justice with
  a heavy hand.</p>

  <p>Bernel&mdash;as soon as he grew to persecutable
  age&mdash;provided Tom with another victim. But time was on the
  victims' side, and when Nance got to be twelve&mdash;Bernel being
  then eight and Tom eighteen&mdash;their combined energies and
  furies of revolt against his oppressions put matters more on a
  level.</p>

  <p>Many a pitched battle they had, and sometimes almost won. But,
  win or lose, the fact that they had no longer to suffer without
  lifting a hand was great gain to them, and the very fact that
  they had to go about together for mutual protection knitted still
  stronger the ties that bound them one to the other.</p>

  <p>But, though little Nance's earlier years suffered much from
  the black shadow of brother Tom, they were very far from being
  years of darkness.</p>

  <p>She was of an unusually bright and enquiring disposition,
  always wanting to see and know and understand, interested in
  everything about her, and never satisfied till she had got to the
  bottom of things, or at all events as far down as it was possible
  for a small girl to get.</p>

  <p>Her lively chatter and ceaseless questions left her mother and
  Grannie small chance of stagnation. But, if she asked many
  questions&mdash;and some of them posers&mdash;it was not simply
  for the sake of asking, but because she truly wanted to know; and
  even Grannie, who was not naturally talkative, never resented her
  pertinent enquiries, but gave freely of her accumulated wisdom
  and enjoyed herself in the giving.</p>

  <p>When she got beyond their depth at times, or outside their
  limits, she would boldly carry her queries&mdash;and strange ones
  they were at times&mdash;to old Mr. Cachemaille, the Vicar up in
  Sark, making nothing of the journey and the Coup&eacute;e in
  order to solve some, to her, important problem. And he not only
  never refused her but delighted to open to her the stores of a
  well-stocked mind and of the kindest and gentlest of hearts.</p>

  <p>Often and often the people of Vauroque and Plaisance would see
  them pass, hand in hand and full of talk, when the Vicar had
  wished to see with his own eyes one or other of Nance's wonderful
  discoveries, in the shape of cave or rock-pool, or deposit of
  sparkling crystal fingers&mdash;amethyst and topaz&mdash;or what
  not.</p>

  <p>For she was ever lighting on odd and beautiful bits of
  Nature's craftsmanship. Books were hardly to be had in those
  days, and in place of them she climbed fearlessly about the rough
  cliff-sides and tumbled headlands, and looked close at Nature
  with eyes that missed nothing and craved everything.</p>

  <p>To the neighbours the headlands were places where rabbits were
  to be shot for dinner, the lower rocks places where ormers and
  limpets and vraie might be found. But to little Nance the rabbits
  were playfellows whose sudden deaths she lamented and resented;
  the cliff-sides were glorious gardens thick with sweet-scented
  yellow gorse and honeysuckle and wild roses, carpeted with
  primroses and bluebells; and, in their season, rich and juicy
  with blackberries beyond the possibilities of picking.</p>

  <p>She was on closest visiting terms with innumerable broods of
  newly-hatched birdlings&mdash;knew them, indeed, while they were
  still but eggs&mdash;delighted in them when they were as yet but
  skin and mouth&mdash;rejoiced in their featherings and flyings.
  Even baby cuckoos were a joy to her, though, on their
  foster-mothers' accounts she resented the thriftlessness of their
  parents, and grew tired each year of their monotonous call which
  ceased not day or night. But of the larks never, for their songs
  seemed to her of heaven, while the cuckoos were of earth. The
  gulls, too, were somewhat difficult from the friendly point of
  view, but she lay for hours overlooking their domestic
  arrangements and envying the wonders of their matchless
  flight.</p>

  <p>And down below the cliffs what marvels she
  discovered!&mdash;marvels which in many cases the Vicar was fain
  to content himself with at second hand, since closer acquaintance
  seemed to him to involve undoubted risk to limb if not to life.
  Little Nance, indeed, hopped down the seamed cliffs like a rock
  pipit, with never a thought of the dangers of the passage, and he
  would stand and watch her with his heart in his mouth, and only
  shake his grey head at her encouraging assertions that it was
  truly truly as easy as easy. For he felt certain that even if he
  got down he would never get up again. And so, when the triumphant
  shout from below told him she was safely landed, he would wave a
  grateful hand and get back from the edge and seat himself
  securely on a rock, till the rosy face came laughing up between
  him and the shimmering sea, with trophy of weed or shell or
  crystal quartz, and he would tell her all he knew about them, and
  she would try to tell him of all he had missed by not coming
  down.</p>

  <p>There were wonderful great basins down there, all lined with
  pink and green corallines, and full of the loveliest weeds and
  anemones and other sea-flowers, and the rivulets that flowed from
  them to the sea were lined pink and green, too. And this that she
  had brought him was the flaming sea-weed, though truly it did not
  look it now, but in the water it was, she assured him, of the
  loveliest, and there were great bunches there so that the dark
  holes under the rocks were all alight with it.</p>

  <p>She coaxed him doubtfully to the descent of the rounded
  headland facing L'Etat, picking out an easy circuitous way for
  him, and so got him safely down to her own special pool, hollowed
  out of the solid granite by centuries of patient grinding on the
  part of the great boulders within.</p>

  <p>It was there, peering down at the fishes below, that she
  expressed a wish to imitate them; and he agreeing, she ran up to
  the farm for a bit of rope and was back before he had half
  comprehended all the beauties of the pool. And he had no sooner
  explained the necessary movements to her and she had tried them,
  than she cast off the rope, shouting, "I can swim! I can swim!"
  and to his amazement swam across the pool and back&mdash;a good
  fifty feet each way&mdash;chirping with delight in this new-found
  faculty and the tonic kiss of the finest water in the world. But
  after all it was not so very amazing, for she was absolutely
  without fear, and in that water it is difficult to sink.</p>

  <p>They were often down there together after that, for close
  alongside were wonderful channels and basins whorled out of the
  rock in the most fantastic ways, and to sit and watch the tide
  rush up them was a never-failing entertainment.</p>

  <p>And not far away was a blow-hole of the most extraordinary
  which shot its spray a hundred feet into the air, and if you
  didn't mind getting wet you could sit quite alongside it, so
  close that you could put your hand into it as it came rocketing
  out of the hole, and then, if the sun was right, you sat in the
  midst of rainbows&mdash;a thing Nance had always longed to do
  since she clapped her baby hands at her first one. But the Vicar
  never did that.</p>

  <p>And once, in quest of the how and the why, Nance swam into the
  blow-hole's cave at a very low tide, and its size and the dome of
  its roof, compared with the narrowness of its entrance, amazed
  her, but she did not stay long for it gave her the creeps.</p>

  <p>These were some of the ways by which little Nance grew to a
  larger estate than most of her fellows, and all these things
  helped to make her what she came to be.</p>

  <p>When she grew old enough to assist in the farm, new realms of
  delight opened to her. Chickens, calves, lambs, piglets&mdash;she
  foster-mothered them all and knew no weariness in all such duties
  which were rather pleasures.</p>

  <p>It was a wounded rabbit, limping into cover under a tangle of
  gorse and blackberry bashes, that discovered to her the entrance
  to the series of little chambers and passages that led right
  through the headland to the side looking into Port Gorey. Which
  most satisfactory hiding-place she and Bernel turned to good
  account on many an occasion when brother Tom's oppression passed
  endurance.</p>

  <p>It had taken time, and much screwing up of childish courage,
  to explore the whole of that extraordinary little burrow, and it
  was not the work of a day.</p>

  <p>When Nance crept along the little run made by many generations
  of rabbits, she found that it led finally into a dark crack in
  the rock, and, squeezing through that, she was in a small dark
  chamber which smelt strongly of her friends.</p>

  <p>As soon as her eyes recovered from the sudden change from
  blazing sunlight to almost pitch darkness, she perceived a small
  black opening at the far end, and looking through it she saw a
  lightening of the darkness still farther in which tempted her
  on.</p>

  <p>It was a tough scramble even for her, and the closeness of the
  rocks and the loneliness weighed upon her somewhat. But there was
  that glimmer of light ahead and she must know what it was, and so
  she climbed and wriggled over and under the huge splintered rocks
  till she came to the light, like a tiny slit of a window far
  above her head, and still there were passages leading on.</p>

  <p>Next day, with Bernel and a tiny crasset lamp for company, she
  explored the burrow to its utmost limits and adopted it at once
  as their refuge and stronghold. And thereafter they spent much
  time there, especially in the end chamber where a tiny slit gave
  on to Port Gorey, and they could lie and watch all that went on
  down below.</p>

  <p>There they solemnly concocted plans for brother Tom's
  discomfiture, and thither they retreated after defeat or victory,
  while he hunted high and low for them and never could make out
  where they had got to.</p>

  <p>Then Tom went off to sea, and life, for those at home, became
  a joy without a flaw&mdash;except the thought that he would
  sometime come back&mdash;unless he got drowned.</p>

  <p>When he returned he was past the boyish bullying and teasing
  stage, and his stunts and twists developed themselves along other
  lines. Moreover, sailor-fashion, he wore a knife in a sheath at
  the back of his belt.</p>

  <p>He found Nance a tall slim girl of sixteen, her childish
  prettiness just beginning to fashion itself into the strength and
  comeliness of form and feature which distinguished her later
  on.</p>

  <p>He swore, with strange oaths, that she was the prettiest bit
  of goods he'd set eyes on since he left home, and he'd seen a
  many. And he wondered to himself if this could really be the
  Nance he used to hate and persecute.</p>

  <p>But Nance detested him and all his ways as of old.</p>

  <h3>HOW THE NEW MINE CAPTAIN CAME</h3>

  <p>Tom Hamon and Peter Mauger seated themselves on a rock within
  a few feet of the narrow slit out of which Nance and Bernel had
  been looking.</p>

  <p>"Ouaie," said Tom, taking up his parable&mdash;"wanted me to
  join him in getting a loan on farm, he did."</p>

  <p>"Aw, now!"</p>

  <p>"Ouaie&mdash;a loan on farm, and me to join him, 'cause he
  couldn' do it without. 'And why?' I asked him."</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>"An' he told me he was goin' to make a fortune out them silver
  mines."</p>

  <p>"Aw!"</p>

  <p>"Ouaie! He'd put in every pound he had and every shilling he
  earned. An' the more he could put in the more he would get
  out."</p>

  <p>"Aw!"</p>

  <p>"'But,' I said, 'suppos'n it all goes into them big holes and
  never comes out&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Aw!"</p>

  <p>"But he's just crazy 'bout them mines. Says there's silver an'
  lead, and guyabble-knows-what-all in 'em, and when they get it
  out he'll be a rich man."</p>

  <p>"Aw!" said Peter, nodding his head portentously, as one who
  had gauged the futility of earthly riches.</p>

  <p>He was a young man of large possessions but very few words.
  When he did allow his thoughts out they came slowly and in jerks,
  with lapses at times which the hearer had to fill in as best he
  could.</p>

  <p>His father had been an enterprising free-trader, and had made
  money before the family farm came to him on the death of his
  father. He had married another farm and the heiress attached to
  it, and Peter was the result. An only son, both parents dead, two
  farms and a good round sum in the Guernsey Bank, such were
  Peter's circumstances.</p>

  <p>And himself&mdash;good-tempered; lazy, since he had no need to
  work; not naturally gifted mentally, and the little he had,
  barely stirred by the short course of schooling which had been
  deemed sufficient for so worldly-well-endowed a boy; tall,
  loose-limbed, easy going and easily led, Peter was the object of
  much speculation among marriageably inclined maiden hearts, and
  had set his own where it was not wanted.</p>

  <p>"Ouaie," continued Tom, "an' if I'd join him in the loan the
  money'd all come to me when he'd done with it."</p>

  <p>"Aw!... Money isn't everything.... Can't get all you want
  sometimes when you've got all money you want."</p>

  <p>"G'zammin, Peter! You're as crazy 'bout that lass as th' old
  un is 'bout his mines. Why don't ye ask her and ha' done with
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Aw&mdash;yes. Well.... You see.... I'm makin' up to her
  gradual like, and in time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And Bernel in the hole dug his elbow facetiously into Nance's
  side.</p>

  <p>"Mon Gyu! To think of a slip of a thing like our Nance making
  a great big fellow like you as fool-soft as a bit of tallow!" and
  Tom stared at him in amazement. "Why, I've licked her scores of
  times, and I used to lift her up by the hair of her head."</p>

  <p>"I'd ha' knocked your head right off, Tom Hamon, if I'd been
  there. Right off&mdash;yes, an' bumped it on the ground."</p>

  <p>"No, you wouldn't. 'Cause, in the first place, you couldn't,
  and in the second place you wouldn't have looked at her then. She
  was no more to look at than a bit of a rabbit, slipping about,
  scared-like, with her big eyes all round her."</p>

  <p>"Great rough bull of a chap you was, Tom. Ought to had more
  lickings when you was young."</p>

  <p>"Aw!" said Tom.</p>

  <p>"Join him?" asked Peter after a pause.</p>

  <p>"No, I won't, an' he's no right to ask it, an' he knows it.
  Them dirty mines may pay an' they may not, but the farm's a safe
  thing an' I'll stick to it."</p>

  <p>"Maybe new capt'n'll make things go better. That's him, I'm
  thinking, just got ashore from brig without breaking his legs,"
  nodding towards the wooden landing-stage on the other side of the
  gulf. For landing at Port Gorey was at times a matter requiring
  both nerve and muscle.</p>

  <p>A man, however, had just leaped ashore from the brig, and was
  now standing looking somewhat anxiously after the landing of his
  baggage, which consisted of a wooden chest and an old
  carpet-bag.</p>

  <p>When at last it stood safely on the platform, he cast a
  comprehensive look at his surroundings and then turned to the
  group of men who had come down to watch the boat come in, and
  four pairs of eyes on the opposite side of the gulf watched him
  curiously, with little thought of the tremendous part he was to
  play in all their lives.</p>

  <p>"Where's he stop?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>"Our house."</p>

  <p>"Nay!"</p>

  <p>"Ouaie, I tell you. He's to stop at our house."</p>

  <p>"Why doesn't he go to Barracks?"</p>

  <p>"Old Captain's there and they might not agree. Oh ouaie, he'll
  have his hands full, I'm thinking. And if he's not careful it's a
  crack on the head and a drop over the Coup&eacute;e he'll be
  getting."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Peter Mauger.</p>

  <p>"Come you along and see what kind of chap he is."</p>

  <p>"Aw well, I don't mind," and they strolled away to inspect the
  new Mine Captain, who was to brace up the slackened ropes and
  bring the enterprise to a successful issue.</p>

  <p>"Did you know he was going to stop with us, Nance?" asked
  Bernel, as they groped their way out after due interval.</p>

  <p>"I heard father tell mother this morning."</p>

  <p>"Where's he to sleep?"</p>

  <p>"He's to have my room and I'm coming up into the loft. I shall
  take the dark end, and I've put up a curtain across."</p>

  <p>"Shoo! We'll hear enough about the mines now," and they crept
  out behind a gorse bush, and went off across the common towards
  the clump of wind-whipped trees inside which the houses of Little
  Sark clustered for companionship and shelter from the south-west
  gales.</p>

  <h3>HOW GARD MADE NEW ACQUAINTANCES</h3>

  <p>Old Tom Hamon gave the new arrival warm greeting, and pointed
  out such matters as might interest him as they climbed the steep
  road which led up to the plateau and the houses.</p>

  <p>"Assay Office, Mr. Gard.... Captain's Office.... Forge....
  Sark's Hope shaft.... Le Pelley shaft&mdash;ninety fathoms below
  sea-level.... Pump shaft ... and yon to east'ard is Prince's
  shaft.... We go round here behind engine-house.... Yon's my house
  'mong the trees."</p>

  <p>"That's a fine animal," said Gard, stopping suddenly to look
  at a great white horse, which stood nibbling the gorse on the
  edge of the cliff right in the eye of the sun, as it drooped
  towards Guernsey in a holocaust of purple and amber and crimson
  clouds. The glow of the threatening sky threw the great white
  figure into unusual prominence.</p>

  <p>"Yours, Mr. Hamon?" asked Gard&mdash;and the white horse flung
  up its head and pealed out a trumpet-like neigh as though
  resenting the imputation.</p>

  <p>"No," said old Tom, staring at the white horse under his
  shading hand. "Seigneur's. What's he doing down here? He's
  generally kept up at Eperquerie, and that's the best place for
  him. He's an awkward beast at times. I must send and tell Mr. Le
  Pelley where he is."</p>

  <p>The little cluster of white, thatched houses stood close
  together for company, but discreetly turned their faces away from
  one another so that no man overlooked or interfered with his
  neighbour.</p>

  <p>Gard found himself in a large room which occupied the whole
  middle portion of the house and served as kitchen and common room
  for the family.</p>

  <p>The floor was of trodden earth&mdash;hard and dry as cement,
  with a strip of boarding round the sides and in front of the
  fire-place. Heavy oaken beams ran across the roof from which
  depended a great hanging rack littered with all kinds of
  household odds and ends. Along the beams of the roof on hooks
  hung two long guns. One end of the room was occupied by a huge
  fire-place, in one corner of which stood a new iron cooking
  range, and alongside it a heap of white ashes and some
  smouldering sticks of gorse under a big black iron pot filled the
  room with the fragrance of wood smoke. In the opposite side of
  the fire-place was an iron door closing the great baking oven,
  and above it ran a wide mantel-shelf on which stood china dogs
  and glass rolling-pins and a couple of lamps.</p>

  <p>A well-scrubbed white wooden table was set ready for supper.
  On a very ancient-looking black oak stand&mdash;cupboard below
  and shelves above&mdash;was ranged a vast assortment of crockery
  ware, and on the walls hung potbellied metal jugs and cans which
  shone like silver.</p>

  <p>Two doors led to the other rooms of the house, one of them
  wide open.</p>

  <p>One corner of the room was occupied by a great wooden bin
  eight feet square, filled with dried bracken. On the wide flat
  side, which looked like a form, a woman and a girl were sitting
  when the two men entered.</p>

  <p>Hamon introduced them briefly as his wife and daughter, and,
  comely women as Gard had been accustomed to in his own country of
  Cornwall, there was something about these two, and especially
  about the younger of the two, which made him of a sudden more
  than satisfied with the somewhat doubtful venture to which he had
  bound himself&mdash;set a sudden homely warmth in his heart, and
  made him feel the richer for being there&mdash;made him, in fact,
  glad that he had come.</p>

  <p>And yet there was nothing in their reception of him that
  justified the feeling.</p>

  <p>They nodded, indeed, in answer to his bow, but neither their
  faces nor their manner showed any special joy at his coming.</p>

  <p>But that made no difference to him. They were there, and the
  mere sight of the girl's fine mobile face and large dark blue
  eyes was a thing to be grateful for.</p>

  <p>"You'll be wanting your supper," said Hamon.</p>

  <p>"At your own time, please," said the young man, looking
  towards Mrs. Hamon. "I am really not very hungry"&mdash;though
  truth to tell he well might have been, for the food on the brig
  had left much to be desired even to one who had been a sailorman
  himself.</p>

  <p>"It is our usual time," said Mrs. Hamon, "and it is all ready.
  Will you please to sit there."</p>

  <p>At the sound of the chairs a boy of fourteen came quietly in
  and slipped into his seat.</p>

  <p>His sister had gone off with a portion on a plate through the
  open door.</p>

  <p>Gard was surprised to find himself hoping it was not her
  custom to take her meals in private, and was relieved when she
  came back presently without the plate and sat down by her
  brother.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you, Bernel, as soon as you've done your supper run over
  and tell Mr. Le Pelley that his white stallion is on our common,
  and he'd better send for him."</p>

  <p>"I'll ride him home," said the boy exultingly.</p>

  <p>"No you won't, Bern," said his sister quickly. "He's not safe.
  You know what an awkward beast he is at times, and you could
  never get him across the Coup&eacute;e."</p>

  <p>"Pooh! I'd ride him across any day."</p>

  <p>"Promise me you won't," she said, with a hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, if you say so," he grumbled. "I could manage him
  all right though."</p>

  <p>Just then the doorway darkened and two young men entered, and
  threw their caps on the green bed, and sat down with an awkward
  nod of greeting to the company in general.</p>

  <p>"My son Tom," said Mr. Hamon, and Tom jerked another awkward
  nod towards the stranger. "And Peter Mauger"&mdash;Peter repeated
  the performance, more shyly and awkwardly even than Tom, from a
  variety of reasons.</p>

  <p>Tom was at home, and he had not even been invited&mdash;except
  by Tom. And strangers always made him shy. And then there was
  Nance, with her great eyes fixed on him, he knew, though he had
  not dared to look straight at her.</p>

  <p>And then the stranger had an air about him&mdash;it was hard
  to say of what, but it made Peter Mauger and Tom conscious of
  personal uncouthness, and of a desire to get up and go out and
  wash their hands and have a shave.</p>

  <p>Gard, they knew, was the new captain of the mine, chosen by
  the managers of the company for his experience with men, and he
  looked as if he had been accustomed to order them about.</p>

  <p>His eyes were dark and keen, his face full of energy. Being
  clean-shaven his age was doubtful. He might be twenty-five or
  forty. Nance, in her first quick comprehensive glance, had
  wondered which.</p>

  <p>He stood close upon six feet and was broad-chested and
  square-shouldered. A good figure of a man, clean and upstanding,
  and with no nonsense about him. A capable-looking man in every
  respect, and if his manner was quiet and retiring, there was that
  about him which suggested the possibility of explosion if
  occasion arose.</p>

  <p>Not that the Hamon family as a whole, or any member of it,
  would have put the matter quite in that way to itself, or
  herself. But that, vaguely, was the impression produced upon
  them&mdash;an impression of uprightness, intelligence, and
  reserved strength&mdash;and the more strongly, perhaps, because
  of late these characteristics had been somewhat overshadowed in
  the Island by the greed of gain and love of display engendered by
  the opening of the mines.</p>

  <p>To old Tom Hamon his coming was wholly welcome. It
  foreshadowed a strong and more energetic development of the mines
  and the speedier realization of his most earnest desires.</p>

  <p>To Mrs. Hamon it meant some extra household work, which she
  would gladly undertake since it was her husband's wish to have
  the stranger live with them, though in his absorption by the
  mines she had no sympathy whatever.</p>

  <p>Nance looked upon him merely as a part of the mines, and
  therefore to be detested along with the noisy engine-house, the
  pumps, the damp and dirty miners, and all the rest of
  it&mdash;the coming of which had so completely spoiled her
  much-loved Sark.</p>

  <p>Tom disliked him because he made him feel small and boorish,
  and of a commoner make. And feelings such as that inevitably try
  to disprove themselves by noisy self-assertion.</p>

  <p>Accordingly Tom&mdash;after various jocular remarks in patois
  to Peter, who would have laughed at them had he dared, but,
  knowing Nance's feelings towards her brother was not sure how she
  would take it&mdash;loudly and provocatively to Gard&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Expect to make them mines pay, monsieur?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope so. But it's too soon to express an opinion till
  I've seen them."</p>

  <p>"They put a lot of money in, and they get a lot of dirt out,
  but one does not hear much of any silver."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes the deepest mines prove the best in the end."</p>

  <p>"And as long as there's anybody to pay for it I suppose you go
  on digging."</p>

  <p>"If I thought the mines had petered out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said Peter, and then coughed to hide his confusion when
  they all looked at him.</p>

  <p>"I should of course advise the owners to stop work and sink no
  more money."</p>

  <p>"It'll be a bad day for Sark when that happens," said old Tom.
  "But it's not going to happen. The silver's there all right. It
  only wants getting out."</p>

  <p>"If it's there we'll certainly get it out," said Gard, and
  although he said it quietly enough, old Tom felt much better
  about things in general.</p>

  <p>"You're the man for us," he said heartily. "We'll all be rich
  before we die yet."</p>

  <p>"Depends when we die," growled Tom&mdash;in which
  observation&mdash;obvious as it was&mdash;there was undoubtedly
  much truth. And then, his little suggestion of provocation having
  broken like ripples on Gard's imperturbability, he turned on
  Peter and tried to stir him up.</p>

  <p>"You don't get on any too fast with your making up to la
  garche, mon gars," he said in the patois again.</p>

  <p>"Aw&mdash;Tom!" remonstrated Peter, very red in the face at
  this ruthless laying bare of his approaches.</p>

  <p>"Get ahead, man! Put your arm round her neck and give her a
  kiss. That's the way to fetch 'em."</p>

  <p>At which Nance jumped up with fiery face and sparks in her
  eyes and left the room, and Gard, who understood no word of what
  had passed, yet understood without possibility of doubt that
  Tom's speech had been mortally offensive to his sister, and set
  him down in his own mind as of low esteem and boorish
  disposition.</p>

  <p>As for Peter, to whom such advice was as useless as the act
  would have been impossible at that stage of the proceedings, he
  was almost as much upset as Nance herself. He got up with a
  shamefaced&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Aw, Tom, boy, that was not good of you," and made for his
  hat, while Tom sat with a broad grin at the result of his
  delicate diplomacy, and Gard's great regret was that it was not
  possible for him to take the hulking fellow by the neck and
  bundle him out of doors.</p>

  <p>Old Tom made some sharp remark to his son, who replied in
  kind; Mrs. Hamon sat quietly aloof, as she always did when Tom
  and his father got to words, and Bernel made play with his
  supper, as though such matters were of too common occurrence to
  call for any special attention on his part.</p>

  <p>Then Nance's face framed in a black sun-bonnet gleamed in at
  the outer door.</p>

  <p>"Come along, Bern, and we'll go and tell the Seigneur where
  his white horse is," and she disappeared, and Bernel, having
  polished off everything within reach, got up and followed
  her.</p>

  <p>"Will you please to take a look at the mines to-night?" asked
  old Tom of his guest, anxious to interest him in the work as
  speedily as possible.</p>

  <p>"We might take a bit of a walk, and you can tell me all you
  will about things. But I don't take hold till the first of the
  month, and I don't want to interfere until I have a right to. I
  suppose my baggage will be coming up?"</p>

  <p>"Ach, yes! Tom, you take the cart and bring Mr. Gard's things
  up. They are lying on the quay down there. Then we will go along,
  if you please!"</p>

  <p>Old Tom marched him through the wonderful amber twilight to
  the summit of the bluff behind the engine-house&mdash;whence Gard
  could just make out his box and carpet-bag still lying on the
  quay below. And all the way the old man was volubly explaining
  the many changes necessary, in his opinion, to bring the business
  to a paying basis. All which information Gard accepted for
  testing purposes, but gathered from the total the fact that
  through ill health on the part of the departing captain, the
  ropes all round had got slack and that the tightening of them
  would be a matter of no little delicacy and difficulty.</p>

  <p>Sark men, Mr. Hamon explained, were very free and independent,
  and hated to be driven. They did piecework&mdash;so much per
  fathom, and were constitutionally, he admitted, a bit more
  particular as to the so much than as to the fathom. While the
  Cornish and Welsh men, receiving weekly wages, had also grown
  slack and did far less work than they did at first and than they
  might, could, and should do.</p>

  <p>"But," said old Tom frankly, scratching his head, "I don't
  know's I'd like the job myself. Your men are quiet enough to look
  at, but they can boil over when they're put to it. And our
  men&mdash;well, they're Sark, and there's more'n a bit of the
  devil in them."</p>

  <p>"I must get things round bit by bit," said Gard quietly. "It
  never pays to make a fuss and bustle men. Softly does it."</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking you can do it if any man can."</p>

  <p>"I'll have a good try any way."</p>

  <p>"Whereabouts does the Seigneur live?" he asked presently, and
  inconsequently as it seemed, but following out a train of thought
  of his own which needed no guessing at.</p>

  <p>"The Seigneur? Over there in Sark&mdash;across the
  Coup&eacute;e."</p>

  <p>"What's the Coup&eacute;e?"</p>

  <p>"The Coup&eacute;e?&mdash;Mon Gyu!"&mdash;at such colossal
  ignorance&mdash;"Why, ...the Coup&eacute;e's the
  Coup&eacute;e.... Come along, then. Maybe you can get a look at
  it before it's too dark."</p>

  <p>They had got quite out of sound of the clanking engine, and
  were travelling a well-made road, when their attention was drawn
  to a lively struggle proceeding on the common between the road
  and the cliff.</p>

  <p>Tom, setting out after the troubled Peter, had caught sight of
  the Seigneur's white horse and had forthwith decided to take him
  home. Peter, agreeing that it was a piece of neighbourliness
  which the Seigneur would appreciate, had turned back to give his
  assistance.</p>

  <p>By some cajolery they had managed to slip a halter with a
  special length of rope over the wary white head, and there for
  the moment matters hung. For the white horse, with his forelegs
  firmly planted, dragged at one end of the rope and the two men at
  the other, and the issue remained in doubt.</p>

  <p>The doubt, however, was suddenly solved by the white horse
  deciding on more active measures. He swung his great head to one
  side, dragged the men off their feet and started off at a gallop,
  they hanging on as best they could.</p>

  <p>Old Tom and Gard set off after them to see the end of the
  matter, and suddenly, as the roadway dipped between high banks
  and became a hollow way, the white beast gave a shrill squeal,
  flung up his heels, jerked himself free, and vanished like a
  streak of light into the darkness of the lofty bank in front.</p>

  <p>"Mon Gyu!" cried old Tom, and sped up the bank to see the
  end.</p>

  <p>But the white horse knew his way and had no fear. They were
  just in time to hear the rattle of his hoofs, as he disappeared
  with a final shrill defiance into the outer darkness on the
  further side of a mighty gulf, while a stone dislodged by his
  flying feet went clattering down into invisible depths.</p>

  <p>"He's done it," panted old Tom, while Gard gazed with
  something like awe at the narrow pathway, wavering across from
  side to side of the great abyss, out of which rose the growl of
  the sea.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Coup&eacute;e. It's a wonder he managed it. The path slipped
  in the winter and it's narrow in places."</p>

  <p>"And do people cross it in the dark?" asked Gard, thinking of
  the girl and boy who had gone to see the Seigneur.</p>

  <p>"Och yes! It is not bad when you're used to it. Come and see!"
  and he led the way back across the common to the road.</p>

  <p>Gard walked cautiously behind him as he went across the
  crumbling white pathway with the carelessness of custom, and,
  sailor as he had been, he was not sorry when the other side was
  reached, and he could stand in the security of the cutting and
  look back, and down into the gulf where the white waves foamed
  and growled among the boulders three hundred feet below.</p>

  <p>"I've seen a many as did not care to cross that, first time
  they saw it," said old Tom with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not surprised at that. It's apt to make one's head
  spin."</p>

  <p>"I brought captain of brig up here and he wouldn't put a foot
  on it. Not for five hundred pounds, he said."</p>

  <p>"It would have taken more than five hundred pounds to piece
  him together if he'd tumbled down there."</p>

  <p>"That's so."</p>

  <p>A young moon, and a clear sky still rarely light and lofty in
  the amber after-glow, gave them a safe passage back.</p>

  <p>When they reached the house among the trees, Gard bethought
  him of his belongings.</p>

  <p>"And my things from the quay?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"G'zammin! That boy has forgotten all about them, I'll be
  bound. I'll take the cart down myself."</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you."</p>

  <p>When they got back with the box and bag, which no one had
  touched since they were dropped on to the platform four hours
  before, they found that Nance and Bernel had got home and gone
  off to bed, having taken advantage of being across in Sark to
  call on some of their friends there.</p>

  <p>Gard wondered how they would have fared if they had happened
  to be on the Coup&eacute;e when the white horse went thundering
  across.</p>

  <p>He dreamed that night that he was cautiously treading an
  endless white path that swung up and down in the darkness like a
  piece of ribbon in a breeze. And a great white horse came
  plunging at him out of the darkness, and just as he gave himself
  up for lost, a sweet firm face in a black sun-bonnet appeared
  suddenly in front of him, and the white horse squealed and leaped
  over them and disappeared, while the stones he had displaced went
  rattling down into the depths below.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <h3>HOW NANCE SHONE THROUGH HER MODEST VEILING</h3>

  <p>As soon as the old captain's time was up, Gard took up his
  work in the mines with energetic hopefulness.</p>

  <p>His hopefulness was unbounded. His energy he tempered with all
  the tact and discretion his knowledge of men, and his experience
  in handling them, had taught him.</p>

  <p>His father had been lost at sea the year after his son was
  born. His mother, a good and God-fearing woman, had strained
  every nerve to give her boy an education. She died when Stephen
  was fourteen. He took to his father's calling and had followed it
  with a certain success for ten years, by which time he had
  attained the position of first mate.</p>

  <p>Then the owner of the Botallack Mine, in Cornwall, having come
  across him in the way of business, and been struck by his
  intelligence and aptitude, induced him by a lucrative appointment
  to try his luck on land.</p>

  <p>The managers of the Sark Mines, seeking a special man for
  somewhat special circumstances, had applied to Botallack for
  assistance, and Stephen Gard came to Sark as the representative
  of many hopes which, so far, had been somewhat lacking in
  results.</p>

  <p>But, as old Tom Hamon had predicted, he very soon found that
  he had laid his hand to no easy plough.</p>

  <p>The Sark men were characteristically difficult, and made the
  difficulty greater by not understanding him&mdash;or declining to
  understand, which came to the same thing&mdash;when he laid down
  his ideas and endeavoured to bring them to his ways.</p>

  <p>Some, without doubt, had no English, and their patois was
  quite beyond him. Others could understand him an they would, but
  deliberately chose not to&mdash;partly from a conservative
  objection to any change whatever, and partly from an idea that he
  had been imported for the purpose of driving them, and driving is
  the last thing a Sark man will submit to.</p>

  <p>Old Tom Hamon, and a few others who had a financial interest
  in the mines, assisted him all they could, in hopes of thereby
  assisting themselves, but they were few.</p>

  <p>As for the Cornishmen and Welshmen, the success or failure of
  the Sark Mines mattered little to them. There was always mining
  going on somewhere and competent men were always in demand. They
  were paid so much a week, small output or large, and without a
  doubt the small output entailed less labour than the large. They
  naturally regarded with no great favour the man whose present aim
  in life it was to ensure the largest output possible.</p>

  <p>And so Gard found himself confronted by many difficulties,
  and, moreover, and greatly to the troubling of his mind, found
  himself looked upon as a dictator and an interloper by the men
  whom he had hoped to benefit.</p>

  <p>Concerning the mines themselves he was not called upon for an
  opinion. The managers had satisfied themselves as to the presence
  of silver. If his opinion had been asked it would have confirmed
  them. But all he had to do was to follow the veins and win the
  ore in paying quantities, and he found himself handicapped on
  every hand by the obstinacy of his men.</p>

  <p>Outside business matters he was very well satisfied with his
  surroundings.</p>

  <p>In such spare time as he had, he wandered over the Island with
  eager, open eyes, marvelling at its wonders and enjoying its
  natural beauties with rare delight.</p>

  <p>The great granite cliffs, with their deep indentations and
  stimulating caves and crannies; the shimmering blue and green
  sea, with its long slow heave which rushed in foam and tumult up
  the rock-pools and gullies; the softer beauties of rounded down
  and flower-and fern-clad slopes honeycombed with rabbit holes;
  the little sea-gardens teeming with novel life; in all these he
  found his resource and a certain consolation for his
  loneliness.</p>

  <p>And in the Hamon household he found much to interest him and
  not a little ground for speculation.</p>

  <p>Old Mrs. Hamon&mdash;Grannie&mdash;had promptly ordered him in
  for inspection, and, after prolonged and careful observation from
  the interior of the black sun-bonnet, had been understood to
  approve him, since she said nothing to the contrary.</p>

  <p>It took him some time to arrive at the correct relationship
  between young Tom and Nance and Bernel, for it seemed quite
  incredible that fruit so diverse should spring from one parent
  stem.</p>

  <p>For Tom was all that was rough and boorish&mdash;rude to Mrs.
  Hamon, coarse, and at times overbearing to Nance and Bernel, to
  such an extent, indeed, that more than once Gard had difficulty
  in remembering that he himself was only a visitor on sufferance
  and not entitled to interfere in such intimate family
  matters.</p>

  <p>Tom was not slow to perceive this, and in consequence set
  himself deliberately to provoke it by behaviour even more
  outrageous than usual. Time and again Gard would have rejoiced to
  take him outside and express his feelings to their fullest
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>With Mrs. Hamon and Bernel he was on the most friendly
  footing, his undisguised sentiments in the matter of Tom
  commending him to them decisively.</p>

  <p>But with Nance he made no headway whatever.</p>

  <p>It was an absolutely new sensation to him, and a satisfaction
  the meaning of which he had not yet fully gauged, to be living
  under the same roof with a girl such as this. He found himself
  listening for her voice outside and the sound of her feet, and
  learned almost at once to distinguish between the clatter of her
  wooden pattens and any one else's when she was busy in the yard
  or barns.</p>

  <p>Even though she held him at coolest arm's length, and repelled
  any slightest attempt at abridgment of the distance, he still
  rejoiced in the sight of her and found the world good because of
  her presence in it.</p>

  <p>He did not understand her feeling about him in the least. He
  did not know that she had had to give up her room for
  him&mdash;that she detested the mines and everything tainted by
  them, and himself as head and forefront of the offence&mdash;that
  she regarded him as an outsider and a foreigner and therefore
  quite out of place in Sark. He only knew that he saw very little
  of her and would have liked to see a great deal more.</p>

  <p>The very reserve of her treatment of himself&mdash;one might
  even say her passive endurance of him&mdash;served but to
  stimulate within him the wish to overcome it. The attraction of
  indifference is a distinct force in life.</p>

  <p>There was something so trim and neat and altogether
  captivating to him in the slim energetic figure, in its short
  blue skirts and print jacket, as it whisked to and fro, inside
  and out, on its multifarious duties, and still more in the sweet,
  serious face, glimmering coyly in the shadow of the great
  sun-bonnet and always moulded to a fine, but, as it seemed to
  him, a somewhat unnatural gravity in his company.</p>

  <p>And yet he was quite sure she could be very much otherwise
  when she would. For he had heard her singing over her work, and
  laughing merrily with Bernel; and her face, sweet as it was in
  its repression, seemed to him more fitted for smiles and laughter
  and joyousness.</p>

  <p>He saw, of course, that brother Tom was a constant source of
  annoyance to them all, but especially to her, and his blood
  boiled impotently on her account.</p>

  <p>He carried with him&mdash;as a delightful memory of her,
  though not without its cloud&mdash;the pretty picture she made
  when he came upon her one day in the orchard, milking&mdash;for,
  strictly as the Sabbath may be observed, cows must still be
  milked on a Sunday, not being endowed manna-like, with the gift
  of miraculous double production on a Saturday.</p>

  <p>Her head was pressed into her favourite beast's side, and she
  was crooning soothingly to it as the white jets ping-panged into
  the frothing pail, and he stood for a moment watching her
  unseen.</p>

  <p>Then the cow slowly turned her head towards him, considered
  him gravely for a moment, decided he was unnecessary and whisked
  her tail impatiently. Nance's lullaby stopped, she looked round
  with a reproving frown, and he went silently on his way.</p>

  <p>It was another Sunday afternoon that, as he lay in the bracken
  on the slope of a headland, he saw two slim figures racing down a
  bare slope on the opposite side of a wide blue gulf, with joyous
  chatter, and recognized Nance and Bernel.</p>

  <p>They disappeared and he felt lonely. Then they came picking
  their way round a black spur below, and stood for a minute or two
  looking down at something beneath them. Which something he
  presently discovered must be a pool of size among the rocks, for
  after a brief retiral, Nance behind a boulder and Bernel into a
  black hollow, they came out again, she lightly clad in fluttering
  white and Bernel in nothing at all, and with a shout of delight
  dived out of sight into the pool below.</p>

  <p>He could hear their shouts and laughter echoed back by the
  huge overhanging rocks. He saw them climb out again and sit
  sunning themselves on the grey ledge like a pair of sea-birds,
  and Nance's exiguous white garment no longer fluttered in the
  breeze.</p>

  <p>Then in they went again, and again, and again, till, tiring of
  the limits of the pool&mdash;huge as he afterwards found it to
  be&mdash;they crept over the barnacled rocks to the sea, and
  flung themselves fearlessly in, and came ploughing through it
  towards his headland. And he shrank still lower among the
  bracken, for though he had watched the distant little figure in
  white with a slight sense of sacrilege, and absolutely no sense
  of impropriety but only of enjoyment, he would not for all he was
  worth have had her know that he had watched at all, since he
  could imagine how she would resent it.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, these unconscious revelations of her real self
  were to him as jewels of price, and he treasured the memory of
  them accordingly.</p>

  <p>He watched them swim back and disappear among the rocks, and
  presently go merrily up the bare slope again; and he lay long in
  the bracken, scarce daring to move, and when he did, he crept
  away warily, as one guilty of a trespass.</p>

  <p>And glad he was that he had done so, for he had proof of her
  feeling that same night at supper.</p>

  <p>Peter Mauger came sheepishly in again with Tom, and Tom, when
  he had satisfied the edge of his hunger, must wax facetious in
  his brotherly way.</p>

  <p>"Peter and me was sitting among the rocks over against big
  pool s'afternoon and we saw things"&mdash;with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Aw, Tom!" deprecated Peter in red confusion.</p>

  <p>"An' Peter, he said he never seen anything so pretty in all
  his life as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw now, Tom, you're a liar! I never said anything about
  it."</p>

  <p>"You thought it, or your face was liar too, my boy. Like a dog
  after a rabbit it was."</p>

  <p>"It was just like you both to lie watching," flamed Nance. "If
  you'd both go and jump into the sea every day you'd be a great
  deal nicer than you are; and if you'd stop there it would be a
  great deal nicer for us."</p>

  <p>"Aw&mdash;Nance!" from Peter, and a great guffaw from Tom,
  while Gard devoted himself guiltily to his plate.</p>

  <p>"You looked nice before you went in," chuckled Tom, who never
  knew when to stop, "but you looked a sight nicer when you came
  out and sat on rocks with it all stuck to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're a&mdash;a&mdash;a disgusting thing, Tom Hamon, and
  you're just as bad, Peter Mauger!" and she looked as if she would
  have flown at them, but, instead, jumped up and flung out of the
  room.</p>

  <p>Gard's innate honesty would not permit him to take up the
  cudgels this time. Inwardly he felt himself involved in her
  condemnation, though none but himself knew it.</p>

  <p>But he had taken at times to glowering at Tom, when his
  rudeness passed bounds, in a way which made that young man at
  once uncomfortable and angry, and at times provoked him to
  clownish attempts at reprisal.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hamon bore with the black sheep quietly, since nothing
  else was possible to her, though her annoyance and distress were
  visible enough.</p>

  <p>Old Tom was completely obsessed with his visions of wealth
  ever just beyond the point of his pick. He toiled long hours in
  the damp darknesses below seas, with the sounds of crashing waves
  and rolling boulders close above him, and at times threateningly
  audible through the stratum of rocks between; and when he did
  appear at meals he was too weary to trouble about anything beyond
  the immediate satisfaction of his needs. Besides, young Tom had
  long since proved his strength equal to his father's, and
  remonstrance or rebuke would have produced no effect.</p>

  <p>As to Bernel, he was only a boy as yet, but he was Nance's boy
  and all she would have wished him.</p>

  <p>In time he would grow up and be a match for Tom, and meanwhile
  she would see to it that he grew up as different from Tom in
  every respect as it was possible for a boy to be.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <h3>HOW GRANNIE SCHEMED SCHEMES</h3>

  <p>Stephen Gard's experience of women had been small.</p>

  <p>His mother had been everything to him till she died, when he
  was fourteen, and he went to sea.</p>

  <p>When she was gone, that which she had put into him remained,
  and kept him clear of many of the snares to which the life of the
  young sailorman is peculiarly liable.</p>

  <p>When he attained a position of responsibility he had had no
  time for anything else. And so, of his own experience, he knew
  little of women and their ways.</p>

  <p>Less, indeed, than Nance knew of men and their ways. And that
  was not very much and tended chiefly to scorn and
  dissatisfaction, seeing that her knowledge was gleaned almost
  entirely from her experiences of Tom and Peter Mauger. Her father
  was, of course, her father, and on somewhat of a different plane
  from other men.</p>

  <p>And so, if Nance was a wonder and a revelation to Gard, Gard
  was no less of, at all events, a novelty in the way of mankind to
  Nance.</p>

  <p>His quiet bearing and good manners, after a life-long course
  of Tom, had a distinct attraction for her.</p>

  <p>That he could burst into flame if occasion required, she was
  convinced. For, more than once, out of the corner of her eye and
  round the edge of her sun-bonnet, she had caught his thunderous
  looks of disgust at some of Tom's carryings-on.</p>

  <p>She would, perhaps, have been ashamed to confess it but,
  somewhere down in her heart, she rather hoped, sooner or later,
  to see his lightning as well. It would be worth seeing, and she
  was inclined to think it would be good for Tom&mdash;and the rest
  of the family.</p>

  <p>For Gard looked as if he could give a good account of himself
  in case of need. His well-built, tight-knit figure gave one the
  impression that he was even stronger than he looked.</p>

  <p>If only he had been a Sark man and had nothing to do with
  those horrid mines! But all her greatest dislikes met in him, and
  she could not bring herself to the point of relaxing one iota in
  these matters of which he was unfortunately and unconsciously
  guilty.</p>

  <p>The state of affairs at the mines improved not one whit as the
  months dragged on. There was a smouldering core of discontent
  which might break into flame at any moment&mdash;or into
  disastrous explosion if the necessary element were added.</p>

  <p>Old Tom did his best, and stood loyally by the new captain and
  the interests of the mine and himself. But he was in a minority
  and could so far do no more than oppose vehement talk to vehement
  talk, and that, as a rule, is much like pouring oil on roaring
  flames.</p>

  <p>Not many of those who were shareholders in the mine were also
  workers in it, and the workers met constantly at the house of a
  neighbour, who had turned his kitchen to an undomestic but
  profitable purpose by supplying drink to the miners at what
  seemed to the English and Welshmen ridiculously low prices.</p>

  <p>In that kitchen the new captain and his new methods were
  vehemently discussed and handled roughly enough&mdash;in words.
  And hot words and the thoughts they excite, and wild thoughts and
  the words they find vent in, are at times the breeders of deeds
  that were better left undone.</p>

  <p>To all financially interested in the mines the need for
  strictest economy and fullest efficiency was patent enough. It
  was still a case of faith and hope&mdash;a case of continual
  putting in of work and money, and, so far, of getting little
  out&mdash;except the dross which intervened between them and
  their highest hopes.</p>

  <p>There was silver there without a doubt, and the many thin
  veins they came across lured them on with constant hope of mighty
  pockets and deposits of which these were but the flying
  indications.</p>

  <p>And all putting in and getting nothing out results in
  stressful times, in business ventures as in the case of
  individuals. The great shafts sank deeper and deeper, the
  galleries branched out far under the sea, and there was a
  constant call for more and more money, lest that already sunk
  should be lost.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hamon, disappointed in his view of raising money on the
  farm by Tom's obstinacy, in the bitterness of his spirit and the
  urgent necessities of the mines, conceived a new idea which, if
  he was able to carry it out, would serve the double purpose of
  satisfying his own needs at the recalcitrant Tom's expense.</p>

  <p>"I must have more money for the mines," he said to his wife
  one day in private. "I'm thinking of selling the farm."</p>

  <p>"Selling the farm?" gasped Mrs. Hamon, doubtful of her own
  hearing. For selling the farm is the very last resource of the
  utterly unfortunate. "Aye, selling the farm. Why not? It'll all
  come back twenty times over when we strike the pockets, and then
  we can live where we will, or we can go across to Guernsey, or to
  England if you like."</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Hamon was silent and full of thought. She had no
  desire for wealth, and still less to live in Guernsey or in
  England, or anywhere in the world but Sark.</p>

  <p>He had been a good husband to her on the whole, until this
  silver craze absorbed him. She had never found it necessary to
  counter his wishes before. But this idea of selling the farm cut
  to the very roots of her life.</p>

  <p>For Nance's sake and Bernel's she must oppose it with all that
  was in her. If the farm were sold the money would all go into
  those gaping black mouths and bottomless pits at Port Gorey. The
  home would be broken up&mdash;an end of all things. It must not
  be.</p>

  <p>"I should think many times before selling the farm if I were
  you," she said quietly, and left it there for the moment.</p>

  <p>But old Tom, having made up his mind, and the necessities of
  the case pressing, lost no time over the matter.</p>

  <p>"I've been speaking to John Guille about that business," he
  said, next day, in a confidently casual way.</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"About the farm. He'll give me six hundred pounds for it and
  take the stock at what it's worth, and he's willing we should
  stop on as tenants at fifty pounds a year rent."</p>

  <p>His wife was ominously silent. He glanced at her
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I shall stop on as tenant for the present and Tom can go on
  working it. When we reach the silver, and the money begins to
  come back, we can decide what to do afterwards."</p>

  <p>Still his wife said nothing, but her face was white and set.
  It was hard for her to put herself in opposition to him, but here
  she found it necessary. He was going too far.</p>

  <p>It was only when the silence had grown ominous and painful,
  that she said, slowly and with difficulty&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to look like going against you, Tom, but I can't
  see it right you should sell the farm."</p>

  <p>"It'll make no difference to you and the young ones. I'll see
  to that."</p>

  <p>"It's not right and you mustn't do it."</p>

  <p>"Mustn't do it!&mdash;And it's as good as done!"</p>

  <p>"It can't be done until your mother and I consent, and we
  can't see it's a right thing to do."</p>

  <p>"Can't you see that you're only saving the farm for Tom?" he
  argued wrathfully, bottling his anger as well as he could. "It's
  nothing to you and the young ones in any case."</p>

  <p>"I know, but all the same it's not right. If it was to buy
  another farm it would be different, for you could leave it as you
  choose. But to throw away the money on those mines&mdash;"</p>

  <p>This was a lapse from diplomacy and old Tom resented it.</p>

  <p>"Throw the money away!" he shouted, casting all restraint to
  the winds. "Who's going to throw the money away? It's like you
  women. You never can see beyond the ends of your noses. I'll tell
  you what I'll do&mdash;I'll pay you out your dower right in hard
  cash. Will that satisfy you?"</p>

  <p>If he died she would have a life interest in one-third of the
  farm, but could not, of course, will it to Nance or Bernel. If he
  sold the farm and paid her her lawful third in cash, she could do
  what she chose with it. It was therefore distinctly to her own
  interest to fall in with his plan.</p>

  <p>But, dearly as she would have liked to make some provision,
  however small, for Nance and Bernel, her whole Sark soul was up
  in arms against the idea of selling the farm.</p>

  <p>It would feel like a break-up of life. Nothing, she was sure,
  would ever be the same again.</p>

  <p>"It's not right," she said simply.</p>

  <p>"You're a fool&mdash;" and then the look on her quiet
  face&mdash;such a look as she might have worn if he had struck
  her&mdash;penetrated the storm-cloud of his anger. He remembered
  her years of wifely patience and faithful service, "&mdash;a
  foolish woman. A Sark wife should know which side of her bread
  the butter is on. Can't you see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know all that, Tom, but I hope you'll give up this notion
  of selling the farm. Your mother feels just as I do about it.
  We've talked it over&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll talk to her," and he went in at once to the old lady's
  room.</p>

  <p>But Grannie gave him no time for argument.</p>

  <p>"It's you's the fool, Tom," she said decisively, as he crossed
  the threshold. "There's not enough silver in Sark to make a plate
  for your coffin."</p>

  <p>"I brought out more'n enough to make your plate and mine,
  myself to-day," he said triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, bah! You'd have done better for yourself and for Sark if
  you'd let it lie."</p>

  <p>"I'd have done better still if I'd got twice as much."</p>

  <p>"If the good God set silver inside Sark, it was because He
  thought it was the best place for it, and it's not for the likes
  of you to be trying to get it out."</p>

  <p>"What's it there for if it's not to be got out?"</p>

  <p>"You mark me, Tom Hamon, no good will come of all this
  upsetting and digging out the insides of the
  Island&mdash;nenni-gia!"</p>

  <p>"Pergui, mother, where do you think all the silver and gold in
  the world came from?"</p>

  <p>"It didn't come out of our Sark rocks any way, mon gars."</p>

  <p>"Good thing for us if it had, ma f&eacute;! But, see you here,
  mother, if I sell the farm it's not you and Nance that need
  trouble. If I pay out your dowers in hard cash you're both of you
  better off than you are now, and I'm better off too. It's only
  Tom could complain, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's hard on the lad."</p>

  <p>"Bidemme, it's no more than he deserves for his goings-on!
  Maybe it'll do him good to have to work for his living."</p>

  <p>"And you would do that to get your bit more money to throw
  into those big holes?"</p>

  <p>"Never you mind me. I'll take care of myself, and we'll see
  who's wisest in the end. Now, will you agree to it?"</p>

  <p>"I'll talk it over with Nancy again," and the big black
  sun-bonnet nodded with sapient significance. "Send her to
  me."</p>

  <p>"It's from you I got my good sense," said old Tom approvingly,
  and went off in search of his wife, while the clever old lady
  pondered deep schemes.</p>

  <p>"Here's the way of it, Nancy," she said, when Mrs. Hamon came
  in. "He's crazy on these silver mines, and he's willing to pay
  out our dowers, yours and mine, so that he may throw the rest
  into the big holes at Port Gorey. Ch'est b'en! Your money and
  mine take more than half of what he gets. If you'll put yours to
  mine I'll make up the difference from what I've saved, and we'll
  retraite the farm, and it shall go to Nance and Bernel when the
  time comes."</p>

  <p>"I can't help thinking it's rather hard on Tom," suggested
  Mrs. Hamon, with less vigour than before.</p>

  <p>The idea appealed strongly to her maternal feelings and she
  had suffered much from Tom; still her instinct for right was
  there and was not to be stifled with a word.</p>

  <p>"If you feel so when the time comes we could divide it among
  them, and till then Tom would have to behave himself," said the
  wily old lady, with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>That again appealed strongly to Mrs. Hamon.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I would agree to that," she said, after thinking
  it all over.</p>

  <p>All things considered, Grannie's scheme was an excellent one
  and worthy of her.</p>

  <p>By a curious anomaly of Sark law, though a man may not
  mortgage his property without the consent of his
  next-in-succession, he can sell it outright and do what he
  chooses with the proceeds. His wife has a dower right of
  one-third of both real and personal estate, into which she enters
  upon his death. The right, however, is there while he still
  lives, and must be taken into consideration in any sale of the
  property.</p>

  <p>All property is sold subject to the "retraite"; in plain
  English, no sale is completed for six weeks, and within that time
  every member of the seller's family, in due order of succession,
  even to the collateral branches, has the right to take over, or
  withdraw, the property at the same price as has been agreed upon,
  paying in addition to the Seigneur the tr&eacute;zi&egrave;me or
  thirteenth part of the price, as by law provided.</p>

  <p>If Grannie's scheme were carried out, therefore, she and Mrs.
  Hamon would become owners of the farm. Tom would be there on
  sufferance and might be kept within bounds or kicked out. Old Tom
  would have something more to throw into the holes at Port Gorey.
  And Nance and Bernel could be adequately provided for. An
  excellent scheme, therefore, for all concerned&mdash;except young
  Tom, who would have to behave himself better than he was in the
  habit of doing or suffer the consequences.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Nancy. "I don't see that I'd be doing right by
  Nance and Bernel not to agree to that. And if Tom behaves
  himself," at which Grannie grunted doubtfully, "he can have his
  share when the time comes."</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <h3>HOW GARD FOUGHT GALES AND TOM</h3>

  <p>So far the discussion as to the sale of the farm had been
  confined to the elders.</p>

  <p>Young Tom had viewed John Guille's visits to the place with
  the lowering suspicion of a bull at a stranger's invasion of his
  field. He wondered what was going on and surmised that it was
  nothing to his advantage.</p>

  <p>Words had been rare between him and his father since his
  refusal to lend himself to a loan on the farm, but his suspicion
  got the better of his obstinacy at last.</p>

  <p>"What's John Guille want coming about here so much?" he
  demanded bluntly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose he can come if he wants to. He's going to buy the
  farm."</p>

  <p>"Going&mdash;to&mdash;buy&mdash;the&mdash;farm!...
  You&mdash;going&mdash;to&mdash;sell&mdash;the&mdash;farm&mdash;away&mdash;from&mdash;me?"
  roared young Tom, like the bull wounded to the quick.</p>

  <p>"Ouaie, pardi! And why not? You had the chance of saving it
  and you wouldn't."</p>

  <p>"If you do it, I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ouaie! You'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll&mdash;Go'zammin, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unless you're a fool, mon gars, you'll be careful what you
  say or do. It'll all come back from the mines and you'll have
  your share if you behave yourself."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;&mdash; you and your mines!"
  was Tom's valedictory, and he flung away in mortal anger; anger,
  too, which, from a Sark point of view, was by no means
  unjustified. Selling the estate away from the rightful heir was
  disinheritance, a blow below the belt which most testators
  reserve until they are safe from reach of bodily harm.</p>

  <p>Tom left the house and cut all connection with his family. He
  drifted away like a threatening cloud, and the sun shone out, and
  Stephen Gard, with the rest, found greater comfort in his room
  than they had ever found in his company.</p>

  <p>So gracious, indeed, did the atmosphere of the house become,
  purged of Tom, that Gard, to his great joy, found even Nance not
  impossible of approach.</p>

  <p>He had always treated her with extremest deference and
  courtesy, respecting, as far as he was able, her evident wish for
  nothing but the most distant intercourse.</p>

  <p>But he was such a very great change from Tom!</p>

  <p>She caught his dark eyes fixed on her at times with a look
  that reminded her of Helier Baker's black spaniel's, who was a
  very close friend of hers. They had neither dog nor cat at
  present at La Closerie, both having been scrimped by the silver
  mines, when old Tom's first bad attack of economy came on.</p>

  <p>Then, at table, Gard was always quietly on the look-out to
  anticipate her wants. That was a refreshing novelty. Even Bernel,
  her special crony, thought only of his own requirements when food
  stood before him.</p>

  <p>Now and again Gard began to venture on a question direct to
  her, generally concerning some bit of the coast he had been
  scrambling about, and she found it rather pleasant to be able to
  give information about things he did not know to this undoubtedly
  clever mine captain.</p>

  <p>So, little by little, he grew into her barest toleration but
  apparently nothing more, and was puzzled at her aloofness and
  reserve, not understanding at all her bitter feeling against the
  mines and everything connected with them.</p>

  <p>The first time he went to church with her and Bernel was a
  great white-stone day to him.</p>

  <p>He had gone by himself once every Sunday, and done his best to
  follow the service in French, which he was endeavouring to pick
  up as best he could. And, if he could only now and again come
  across a word he understood, still the being in church and
  worshipping with others&mdash;even though it was in an unknown
  tongue&mdash;the sound of the chants and hymns and responses, and
  the mild austerity and reverent intonation of the good old Vicar,
  all induced a Sabbath feeling in him, and made a welcome change
  from the rougher routine of the week, which he would have missed
  most sorely.</p>

  <p>On that special afternoon, he had been lying on the green wall
  of the old French fort, enjoying that most wonderful view over
  the shimmering blue sea, with Herm and Jethou resting on it like
  great green velvet cushions, and Guernsey gleaming softly in the
  distance, and Brecqhou and the Gouliot Head, and all the black
  outlying rocks fringed with creamy foam, till it should be time
  to go along to church.</p>

  <p>When he heard voices in the road below and saw Nance and
  Bernel, he jumped up on the spur of the moment, and pushed
  through the gorse and bracken, and stood waiting for them.</p>

  <p>"Will you let me join you?" he asked, as they came up, fallen
  shyly silent.</p>

  <p>"We don't mind," said Bernel, and they went along
  together.</p>

  <p>"This always strikes me afresh, each time I see it, as one of
  the most extraordinary places I've come across," said Gard, as
  they dipped down towards the Coup&eacute;e.</p>

  <p>"Wait till we're coming home," said Bernel hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"You see those clouds over there? That's
  wind&mdash;sou'-west&mdash;you'll see what it's like after
  church."</p>

  <p>"Your gales are as extraordinary as all the rest&mdash;and
  your tides and currents and sea-mists. I suppose one must be born
  here to understand them. We have a fine coast in Cornwall, but I
  think you beat us."</p>

  <p>"Of course. This is Sark."</p>

  <p>"And does no one ever tumble over the Coup&eacute;e in the
  dark?"</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;o, not often, any way. Nance once saw a man blown
  over."</p>

  <p>"That was a bad thing to see," said Gard, turning towards her.
  "How was it?"</p>

  <p>"I was coming from school&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, all alone. The others had gone on; I'd been kept in, and
  it was nearly dark. It was blowing hard, and when I got to the
  first rock here I thought it was going to blow me over. So I went
  down on my hands and knees and was just going to crawl, when old
  Hirzel Mollet came down the other side with a great sheaf of
  wheat on his back. He was taking it to the Seigneur for his
  tithes. And then in a moment he gave a shout and I saw he was
  gone."</p>

  <p>"That was terrible. What did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I screamed and crawled back across the narrow bit to the
  cutting, and ran screaming up to the cottages at Plaisance, and
  Thomas Carr&eacute; and his men came running down. But they could
  do nothing. They went round in a boat from the Creux, but he was
  dead."</p>

  <p>"And how did you get home?"</p>

  <p>"Thomas Carr&eacute; took me across and I ran on alone, but it
  was months before I could forget poor old Hirzel Mollet."</p>

  <p>"I should think so, indeed. That was a terrible thing to
  see."</p>

  <p>The opening of the mines, and the influx of the Welsh and
  Cornishmen and their wives and children, with their new and
  up-to-date ideas of living and dressing, had wrought a great and
  not altogether wholesome change upon the original
  inhabitants.</p>

  <p>All the week they were hard at work in their fields or their
  boats, but on Sunday the lonely lanes leading to Little Sark were
  thronged with sightseers, curious to inspect the mines and the
  latest odd fashions among the miners' wives and daughters.</p>

  <p>Odd, and extremely useless little parasols, were then the
  vogue in England. The miners' women-folk flaunted these before
  the dazzled eyes of the Sark girls, and Sark forthwith burst into
  flower of many-coloured parasols.</p>

  <p>The mine ladies dressed in printed cottons of strange and
  wonderful patterns. The Sark girls must do the same.</p>

  <p>"Tiens!" ejaculated Nance more than once, as they walked.
  "Here is Judi Le Masurier with a new pink parasol!&mdash;and a
  straw bonnet with green strings!&mdash;and every day you'll see
  her about the fields without so much as a sun-bonnet on! And
  Rachel Guille has got a new print dress all red roses and lilac!
  Mon Gyu, what are we coming to!"</p>

  <p>She had many such comments and still more unspoken ones. But
  Stephen Gard, glancing, whenever he could do so unperceived, at
  the trim but plainly-dressed little sun-bonneted figure by his
  side, vowed in his heart that the whole of these others rolled
  into one were not to be compared with her, and that he would give
  all the silver in the mines of Sark to win her appreciation and
  regard.</p>

  <p>As they turned the corner at Vauroque, they came suddenly on a
  number of men lounging on the low wall, and among them Tom Hamon,
  pipe in mouth and hands in pockets.</p>

  <p>As they passed he made some jocular remark in the patois which
  provoked a guffaw from the rest, and reddened Nance's face, and
  caused Bernel to glance up at Gard and jerk round angrily towards
  Tom.</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" asked Gard, stopping.</p>

  <p>But Nance hurried on and he could not but follow.</p>

  <p>"What was it?" he asked again, as he caught up with her.</p>

  <p>"If you please, do not mind him. It was just one of his
  rudenesses."</p>

  <p>"They want knocking out of him."</p>

  <p>"He is very rude," said Nance, and they passed the Vicarage
  and turned up the stony lane to the church.</p>

  <p>Gard was surprised by the speedy verification of Bernel's
  weather forecast. Before the service was over the wind was
  howling round the building with the sounds of unleashed furies,
  and when they got out it was almost dark.</p>

  <p>They bent to the gale and pressed on, Gard with a
  discomforting remembrance that the Coup&eacute;e lay ahead.</p>

  <p>As they passed Vauroque there seemed a still larger crowd of
  loafers at the corner, and again Tom's voice called rudely after
  them.</p>

  <p>Gard turned promptly and strode back to where he was sitting
  on the wall, dangling his feet in devil-may-care fashion. Tom
  jumped down to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Say that again in English, will you?" said Gard angrily.</p>

  <p>"Go to&mdash;!" said Tom.</p>

  <p>Then Gard's left fist caught him on the hinge of the right
  jaw, and he reeled back among the others who had jumped down to
  back him up.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;? Want any more?" asked Gard stormily.</p>

  <p>"You wait," growled Tom, nursing his jaw, "I'll talk to you
  one of these days."</p>

  <p>"Whenever you like, you cur. What you need is a sound
  thrashing and a kick over the Coup&eacute;e."</p>

  <p>To his surprise none of the others joined in. But he did not
  know them.</p>

  <p>They might guffaw at Tom's unseemly pleasantries, but they
  held him in no high esteem&mdash;either for himself or for his
  position, since word of the sale of La Closerie had got
  about.</p>

  <p>Then they were a hardy crew and held personal courage and
  prowess in high respect. And in this matter there could be no
  possible doubt as to where the credit lay.</p>

  <p>"Goin' to fight him, Tom?" drawled one, in the patois.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;him!" growled Tom, but made no move that way.</p>

  <p>And Gard turned and went over to Nance and Bernel, who were
  sheltering from the storm in lee of one of the cottages.</p>

  <p>If he could have seen it, there was a warmer feeling in her
  heart for him than had ever been there before&mdash;a novel
  feeling, too, of respect and confidence such as she had never
  entertained towards any other man in all her life.</p>

  <p>For that quick blow had been struck on her behalf, she knew;
  and it was vastly strange, and somehow good, to feel that a great
  strong man was ready to stand up for her and, if necessary, to
  fight for her.</p>

  <p>She pressed silently on against the gale, with an odd little
  glow in her heart, and a feeling as though something new had
  suddenly come into her life.</p>

  <p>The gale caught them at the Coup&eacute;e, and the crossing
  seemed to Gard not without its risks.</p>

  <p>Bernel bent and ran on through the darkness without a thought
  of danger.</p>

  <p>Gard hesitated one moment and Nance stretched a hand to him,
  and he took it and went steadily across.</p>

  <p>And, oh, the thrill of that first living touch of her! The
  feel of the warm nervous little hand sent a tingling glow through
  him such as he had never in his life experienced before. Verily,
  a white-stone day this, in spite of winds and darkness!</p>

  <p>The gale howled like ten thousand demons, and the noise of the
  waves in Grande Gr&egrave;ve came up to them in a ceaseless
  savage roar. Gard confessed to himself that, alone, he would
  never have dared to face that perilous storm-swept bridge. But
  the small hand of a girl made all the difference and he stepped
  alongside her without a tremor.</p>

  <p>"B'en, Monsieur Gard, was I right?" shouted Bernel in his ear,
  as they stepped within the shelter of the cutting on the farther
  side.</p>

  <p>"You were right. It's a terrible place in a gale."</p>

  <p>"You wait," shouted Bernel. "We're not home yet."</p>

  <p>"No more Coup&eacute;es, any way," and they bent again into
  the storm.</p>

  <p>They had not gone more than a hundred yards when, through some
  freakish funnelling of the tumbled headlands, the gale gripped
  them like a giant playing with pigmies, caught them up, flung
  them bodily across the road and held Gard and Bernel pinned and
  panting against the green bank, while Nance disappeared over it
  into the shrieking darkness.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" gasped Gard, fearful lest she should have been
  blown over the cliffs, and wriggled himself up under the
  ceaseless thrashing of the gale and was whirled off the top into
  the field beyond.</p>

  <p>There the pressure was less, and, getting on to his hands and
  knees to crawl in search of Nance, he found her close beside him
  crouching in the lee of the grassy dyke.</p>

  <p>He crept into shelter beside her, and presently, in the lull
  after a fiercer blast than usual, she set off, bent almost
  double, and in a moment they were in comparative quiet. Nance
  crawled through a gap into the road and they found Bernel waiting
  for them.</p>

  <p>"Knew you'd come through there. That's what that gap's made
  for," he shouted.</p>

  <p>"I've been in many a storm but I never felt wind like that
  before," said Gard, as soon as his breath came back.</p>

  <p>"If you'd stopped with me you'd have been all right," said
  Bernel. "There was no need for you to go after Nance. We've been
  through that lots of times, haven't we, Nance?"</p>

  <p>"Lots."</p>

  <p>"I shall know next time," said Gard, and to Nance it was a
  fresh experience to think of some one going out of his way to be
  of possible service to her.</p>

  VIII</h2>

  <h3>HOW TOM WANTED TO BUT DIDN'T DARE</h3>

  <p>Before the six weeks allowed by Sark law for the retraiting of
  the property had expired, Grannie and Mrs. Hamon put in their
  claims, and it became generally known that they would become the
  new owners of La Closerie, in place of John Guille.</p>

  <p>When the rumour at length reached Tom's ears, he, not
  unnaturally perhaps, set down the whole matter as a plot to oust
  him from his heritage and put Nance and Bernel in his place.</p>

  <p>So his anger grew, and he was powerless. And the impotence of
  an angry man may lead him into gruesome paths. Smouldering fires
  burst out at times into devastating flames, and maddened bulls
  put down their heads and charge regardless of consequences.</p>

  <p>When Tom Hamon asked Peter Mauger to lend him his gun to go
  rabbit-shooting one night, Peter, if he had been a thoughtful
  man, would have declined.</p>

  <p>But Peter was above all things easy-going, and anything but
  thoughtful of such matters as surged gloomily in Tom's angry
  head, and he lent him his gun as a matter of course.</p>

  <p>And Tom went off across the Coup&eacute;e into Little Sark,
  nursing his black devil and thinking vaguely and gloomily of the
  things he would like to do. For to rob a man of his rights in
  this fashion was past a man's bearing, and if he was to be ruined
  for the sake of that solemn-faced slip of a Nance and that young
  limb of a Bernel, he might as well take payment for it all, and
  cut their crowing, and give them something to remember him
  by.</p>

  <p>He had no very definite intentions. His mind was a chaos of
  whirling black furies. He would like to pay somebody out for the
  wrongs under which he was suffering&mdash;who, or how, was of
  little moment. He had been wounded, he wanted to hit back.</p>

  <p>He turned off the Coup&eacute;e to the left and struck down
  through the gorse and bracken towards the Pot, and then crept
  along the cliffs and across the fields towards La
  Closerie&mdash;still for three days his, in the reversion; after
  that, gone from him irrevocably&mdash;a galling shame and not to
  be borne by any man that called himself a man.</p>

  <p>Should he lie in the hedge and shoot down the old man as he
  came in from those cursed mines which had started all the
  trouble? Or should he walk right into the house and shoot and
  fell whatever he came across? If he must suffer it would at all
  events be some satisfaction to think that he had made them suffer
  too.</p>

  <p>From where he stood he could look right in through the open
  door, and could hear their voices&mdash;Nance and Bernel and Mrs.
  Hamon&mdash;the interlopers, the schemers, the stealers of his
  rights.</p>

  <p>The shaft of light was eclipsed suddenly as Nance came out and
  tripped across the yard on some household duty.</p>

  <p>He remembered how he used to terrify her by springing out of
  the darkness at her. She had helped to bring all this trouble
  about.</p>

  <p>Why should he not&mdash;? Why should he not&mdash;?</p>

  <p>And while his gun still shook in his hands to the wild
  throbbing of his pulses, Nance passed out of his sight into the
  barn.</p>

  <p>The deed a man may do on the spur of the moment, when his
  brain is on fire, is not so readily done when it has to be
  thought about.</p>

  <p>Then Mrs. Hamon came to the door, and called to Nance to bring
  with her a piece or two of wood for the fire.</p>

  <p>Here was his chance! Here was the head and front of the
  offence, past, present, and future! If she had never come into
  the family there would have been no Nance, no Bernel, no selling
  of the farm, maybe. A movement of the arms, the crooking of a
  finger, and things would be even between them.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;it would still be he who would have to pay&mdash;as
  always!</p>

  <p>All through he had been the sufferer, and if he did this thing
  he must suffer still more&mdash;always he who must pay.</p>

  <p>The man who hesitates is lost, or saved. When the contemplator
  of evil deeds begins also to contemplate consequences, reason is
  beginning to resume her sway.</p>

  <p>Then he heard heavy footsteps and voices. His father and
  Stephen Gard.</p>

  <p>Another chance! Gard he hated. There was a bruise on his right
  jaw still. And the old man!&mdash;he had cut him out of his
  inheritance by going crazy over those cursed mines.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry you have gone so far," Gard was saying as they
  passed. "If you had consulted me I should have advised against
  it. Mining is always more or less of a speculation. I would
  never, if I could help it, let any man put more into a mine than
  he can afford to lose."</p>

  <p>"If you know a thing's a good thing you want all you can get
  out of it," said old Tom stoutly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, if&mdash;" and they passed into the house, while Tom in
  the hedge was considering which of them he would soonest see
  dead.</p>

  <p>Now they were all inside together. A full charge of small shot
  might do considerable and satisfactory damage.</p>

  <p>But thought of the certain consequences to himself welled
  coldly up in him again, and he slunk noiselessly away, cursing
  himself for leaving undone the work he had come out to do.</p>

  <p>On the common above the Pot, a terrified white scut rose
  almost under his feet and sped along in front of him. He blew it
  into rags, and was so ashamed of his prowess that he kicked the
  remnants into the gorse and went home empty-handed.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <h3>HOW OLD TOM FOUND THE SILVER HEART</h3>

  <p>One of the first things Stephen Gard had seen to, when he got
  matters into his own hands, was the safeguarding of the mines
  from ever-possible irruption of the sea. The great steam pumps
  kept the workings reasonably clear of drainage water, but no
  earthly power could drain the sea if it once got in.</p>

  <p>The central shafts had sunk far below sea-level. The lateral
  galleries had, in some cases, run out seawards and were now
  extending far under the sea itself.</p>

  <p>From the whirling coils of the tides and races round the
  coast, he judged that the sea-bed was as seamed and broken and
  full of faults as the visible cliffs ashore.</p>

  <p>In bad weather, the men in those submarine galleries and the
  outbranching tunnels could hear the crash of the waves above
  their heads, and the rolling and grinding of the mighty boulders
  with which they disported.</p>

  <p>If, by chance, the sea should break through, the peril to life
  and property would be great.</p>

  <p>He therefore caused to be constructed and fitted inside each
  tunnel, at the point where it branched from its main gallery, a
  stout iron door, roughly hinged at the top and falling, in case
  of need, into the flange of a thick wooden frame. The framework
  was fitted to the opening on the seaward side, in a groove cut
  deep into the rock round each side and top and bottom. The heavy
  iron door, when open, lay up against the roof of the tunnel and
  was supported by two wooden legs. If the sea should break
  through, the first rush of the water would sweep away the
  supporting legs, the iron door would fall with a crash into the
  flange of the wooden frame, and the greater the pressure the
  tighter it would fit.</p>

  <p>So the weight of the sea would seal the iron door against the
  wooden casement, which would swell and press always tighter
  against the rock, and that boring would be closed for ever. And
  if any man should be inside the tunnel when the sea broke
  through, there he must stop, drowned like a rat in its hole,
  unless by a miracle he could make his way along the tunnel before
  the trap-door fell.</p>

  <p>Gard never ceased to enjoin the utmost caution on the men who
  undertook these outermost experimental borings.</p>

  <p>His strict injunctions were to cease work at the first sign of
  water in these undersea tunnels, make for the gallery, close the
  trap, and await events.</p>

  <p>Believing absolutely in the existence of one or more great
  central deposits whence all these thin veins of silver had come,
  and hoping to strike them at every blow of his pick, old Tom
  Hamon was the keenest explorer and opener of new leads in the
  mine.</p>

  <p>"The silver's there all right," he said, time and again, "it
  only wants finding," and he pushed ahead, here and there,
  wherever he thought the chances most favourable.</p>

  <p>He took his rightful pay along with the rest for the work he
  did, but it was not for wages he wrought. Ever just beyond the
  point of his energetic pick lay fortune, and he was after it with
  all his heart and soul and bodily powers.</p>

  <p>For months he had been following up a vein which ran out under
  the sea, and grew richer and richer as he laid it bare. He
  believed it would lead him to the mother vein, and that to the
  heart of all the Sark silver. And so he toiled, early and late,
  and knew no weariness.</p>

  <p>His tunnel, in places not more than three and four feet high
  and between two and three feet wide, extended now several hundred
  feet under the sea, and was fitted at the gallery end with the
  usual raised iron door.</p>

  <p>It was hot work in there, in the dim-lighted darkness, in
  spite of the fact that the sea was close above his head.
  Fortunately, here and there, he had come upon curious little
  chambers like empty bubbles in one-time molten rock, ten feet
  across and as much in height, some of them, and curiously whorled
  and wrought, and these allowed him breathing spaces and welcome
  relief from the crampings of the passage.</p>

  <p>When he had broken into such a chamber it needed, at times, no
  little labour to rediscover his vein on the opposite side. But he
  always found it in time, and broke through the farther wall with
  unusual difficulty, and went on.</p>

  <p>The men generally worked in pairs, but old Tom would have no
  one with him. He did all the work, picking and hauling the refuse
  single-handed. The work should be his alone, his alone the glory
  of the great and ultimate discovery.</p>

  <p>The rocks above him sweated and dripped at times, but that was
  only to be expected and gave him no anxiety. Alone with his eager
  hopes he chipped and picked, and felt no loneliness because of
  the flame of hope that burned within him. Above him he could hear
  the long roll and growl of the wave-tormented boulders&mdash;now
  a dull, heavy fall like the blow of a gigantic mallet, and again
  a long-drawn crash like shingle grinding down a hillside. But
  these things he had heard before and had grown accustomed to.</p>

  <p>And so it was fated that, one day, after patiently picking
  round a great piece of rock till it was loosened from its
  ages-old bed, he felt it tremble under his hand, and leaning his
  weight against it, it disappeared into space beyond.</p>

  <p>That had happened before when he struck one of the chambers,
  and he felt no uneasiness. If there had been water beyond, it
  would have given him notice by oozing round the rock as he
  loosened it. The brief rush of foul gas, which always followed
  the opening of one of these hollows, he avoided by lying flat on
  the ground until he felt the air about him sweeter again.</p>

  <p>Then, enlarging the aperture with his pick, he scrambled
  through into this chamber now first opened since time began.</p>

  <p>It was like many he had seen before, but considerably larger.
  Holding his light at arm's length, above his head, a million
  little eyes twinkled back at him as the rays shot to and fro on
  the pointed facets of the rock crystals which hung from the roof
  and started out of the walls and ground.</p>

  <p>The gleaming fingers seemed all pointed straight at him. Was
  it in mockery or in acknowledgment of his prowess?</p>

  <p>For, in among the pointing fingers, it seemed to him that the
  silver-bearing veins ran thick as the setting of an ancient
  jewel, twisted and curling and winding in and out so that his
  eyes were dazzled with the wonder of it all.</p>

  <p>"A man! A man at last! Since time began we have awaited him,
  and this is he at last!" so those myriad eyes and pointing
  fingers seemed to cry to him.</p>

  <p>And up above, the roar and growl of the sea sounded closer
  than ever before.</p>

  <p>But he had found his treasure and he heeded nought beside.
  Here, of a surety, he said to himself, was the silver heart from
  which the scattered veins had been projected. He had found what
  he had sought with such labours and persistency. What else
  mattered?</p>

  <p>And then, without a moment's warning&mdash;the end.</p>

  <p>No signal crackings, no thin jets or streams from the green
  immensity beyond.</p>

  <p>Just one universal collapse, one chaotic climacteric, begun
  and ended in the same instant, as the crust of the chamber, no
  longer supported by the in-pent air, dissolved under the
  irresistible pressure of the sea.</p>

  <p>Where the sparkling chamber had been was a whirling vortex of
  bubbling green water, in which tumbled grotesquely the body of a
  man.</p>

  <p>The water boiled furiously along the tunnel and foamed into
  the gallery. The wooden supports of the iron door gave way; the
  door sank slowly into its appointed place.</p>

  <p>Old Tom Hamon was dead and buried.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <h3>HOW YOUNG TOM FOUND HIS MATCH</h3>

  <p>The news spread quickly.</p>

  <p>Tom Hamon heard it as he sat brooding over his wrongs and
  cursing the chicken-heartedness and fear of consequences which
  had robbed him of his revenge.</p>

  <p>He started up with an incredulous curse and tore across the
  Coup&eacute;e to the mines to make sure.</p>

  <p>But there was no doubt about it. Old Tom was dead: the six
  weeks were still two days short of their fulfilment; the property
  was his; his day had come.</p>

  <p>He walked straight to La Closerie, and stalked grimly into the
  kitchen, where, as it happened, they were sitting over a doleful
  and long-delayed meal.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hamon had been too overwhelmed by the unexpected blow to
  consider all its bearings. Grannie, looking beyond, had foreseen
  consequences and trouble with Tom, and had sent for Stephen Gard
  and given him some elementary instruction relative to the laws of
  succession in Sark.</p>

  <p>Tom stalked in upon them with malevolent triumph. They had
  tried their best to oust him from his inheritance and the act of
  God had spoiled them. He felt almost virtuous.</p>

  <p>But his natural truculence, and his not altogether unnatural
  exultation at the frustration of these plans for his own
  upsetting, overcame all else. Of regret for their personal loss
  and his own he had none.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;ho! Mighty fine, aren't we, feasting on the best,"
  he began. "Let me tell you all this is mine now, spite of all
  your dirty tricks, and you can get out, all of you, and the
  sooner the better. Eating my best butter, too! Ma f&eacute;, fat
  is good enough for the likes of you," and he stretched a long arm
  and lifted the dish of golden butter from the board&mdash;butter,
  too, which Nance and her mother had made themselves after also
  milking the cows.</p>

  <p>"Put that down!" said Gard, in a voice like the taps of a
  hammer.</p>

  <p>"You get out&mdash;bravache! Bretteur! I'm master here."</p>

  <p>"In six weeks&mdash;if you live that long. Until things are
  properly divided you'll keep out of this, if you're well
  advised."</p>

  <p>"I will, will I? We'll see about that, Mister Bully. I know
  what you're up to, trying to fool our Nance with your foreign
  ways, and I won't have it. She's not for the likes of you or any
  other man that's got a wife and children over in
  England&mdash;"</p>

  <p>This was the suddenly-thought-of burden of a discussion over
  the cups one night at the canteen, soon after Gard's arrival,
  when the possibility of his being a married man had been mooted
  and had remained in Tom's turgid brain as a fact.</p>

  <p>"By the Lord!" cried Gard, starting up in black fury, "if you
  can't behave yourself I'll break every bone in your body."</p>

  <p>And Nance's face, which had unconsciously stiffened at Tom's
  words, glowed again at Gard's revelation of the natural man in
  him, and her eyes shone with various emotions&mdash;doubts,
  hopes, fears, and a keen interest in what would follow.</p>

  <p>The first thing that followed was the dish of butter, which
  hurtled past Gard's head and crashed into the face of the clock,
  and then fell with a flop to the earthen floor.</p>

  <p>The next was Tom's lowered head and cumbrous body, as he
  charged like a bull into Gard and both rolled to the ground, the
  table escaping catastrophe by a hair's-breadth.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hamon had sprung up with clasped hands and piteous face.
  Nance and Bernel had sprung up also, with distress in their faces
  but still more of interest. They had come to a certain reliance
  on Gard's powers, and how many and many a time had they longed to
  be able to give Tom a well-deserved thrashing!</p>

  <p>Through the open door of her room came Grannie's hard little
  voice, "Now then! Now then! What are you about there?" but no one
  had time to tell her.</p>

  <p>Gard was up in a moment, panting hard, for Tom's bull-head had
  caught him in the wind.</p>

  <p>"If you want ... to fight ... come outside!" he jerked.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;&mdash; you!" shouted Tom, as he struggled to his
  knees and then to his feet. "I'll smash you!" and he lowered his
  head and made another blind rush.</p>

  <p>But this time Gard was ready for him, and a stout buffet on
  the ear as he passed sent him crashing in a heap into the bowels
  of the clock, which had witnessed no such doings since Tom's
  great-grandfather brought it home and stood it in its place, and
  it testified to its amazement at them by standing with hands
  uplifted at ten minutes to two until it was repaired many months
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>Tom got up rather dazedly, and Gard took him by the shoulders
  and ran him outside before he had time to pull himself
  together.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Gard, shaking him as a bull-dog might a calf. "See
  here! You're not wanted here at present, and if you make any more
  trouble you'll suffer for it," and he gave him a final whirl away
  from the house and went in and closed the door.</p>

  <p>Tom stood gazing at it in dull fury, thought of smashing the
  window, picked up a stone, remembered just in time that it would
  be his window, so flung the stone and a curse against the door
  and departed.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Gard, looking deprecatingly at Nance. "I'm
  afraid I lost my temper."</p>

  <p>"It was all his fault," said Nance. "Did he hurt you?"</p>

  <p>"Only my feelings. He had no right to say such things or do
  what he did."</p>

  <p>"It's always good to see him licked," said Bernel with gusto.
  "Nance and I used to try, but he was too big for us."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hamon had gone in with a white face to explain things to
  Grannie.</p>

  <p>She came back presently and said briefly to Gard, "She wants
  you," and he went in to the old lady.</p>

  <p>"You did well, Stephen Gard," she chirped. "Stand by them, for
  they'll need it. He's a bad lot is Tom, and he'll make things
  uncomfortable when he comes here to live. When Nancy takes her
  third of what's left of the house, that'll be only two rooms, so
  you'll have to look out for another, and maybe you'll not find it
  easy to get one in Little Sark. If you take my advice you'll try
  Charles Guille at Clos Bourel, or Thomas Carr&eacute; at the
  Plaisance Cottages by the Coup&eacute;e, they're kindly folk
  both. I've told Nancy to get Philip Tanquerel of Val Creux to
  help her portion the lots, and it'll be no easy job, for Tom will
  choose the best and get all he can."</p>

  <p>They were agreeably surprised to hear no more of Tom, but
  learned before long that, on the strength of his unexpected good
  fortune, he had gone over to Guernsey to pass, in ways that most
  appealed to him, the six weeks allowed by the law for the
  settlement of his father's affairs.</p>

  <p>Within that six weeks Philip Tanquerel of Val Creux had, on
  Mrs. Hamon's behalf, to allot all old Tom's estate, house,
  fields, cattle, implements, furniture, into three as equal
  portions as he could contrive with his most careful balancing of
  pros and cons. For, with Solomon-like wisdom, Sark law entails
  upon the widow the apportionment of the three lots into which
  everything is divided, but allows the heir first choice of any
  two of them, the remaining lot becoming the widow's dower.</p>

  <p>No light undertaking, therefore, the apportionment of those
  lots, or the widow may be left with only bedrooms to live in, and
  an ill proportion of grazing ground for her cattle and herself to
  live upon. For, be sure that when it comes to the picking of
  these lots, even the best of sons will pick the plums, and when
  such an one as Tom Hamon is in question it is as well to mingle
  the plums and the sloes with an exactitude of proportionment that
  will allow of no advantage either way.</p>

  <h3>HOW GARD DREW NEARER TO HIS HEART'S DESIRE</h3>

  <p>Gard's isolation was brought home to him when he endeavoured
  to find another lodging in Little Sark.</p>

  <p>Accommodation was, of course, limited. Many of the miners had
  to tramp in each day from Sark. There was still, in spite of all
  his tact and efforts, somewhat of a feeling against him as a
  new-comer, an innovator, a tightener of loose cords, and no one
  offered to change quarters to oblige him. And so, in the end, he
  took Grannie's advice and found a room in one of the
  thatch-roofed cottages which offered their white-washed shoulders
  to the road just where it rose out of the further side of the
  Coup&eacute;e into Sark.</p>

  <p>They were quiet, farmer-fisher folk who lived there, having
  nothing to do with the mines and little beyond a general interest
  in them.</p>

  <p>When not at work, he was thrown much upon himself, and if in
  his rambles he chanced upon Bernel Hamon it was a treat, and if,
  as happened all too seldom, upon Nance as well, an enjoyment
  beyond words.</p>

  <p>But Nance was a busy maid, with hens and chickens, and cows
  and calves, and pigs and piglets claiming her constant attention,
  and it was only now and again that she could so arrange her
  duties as to allow of a flight with Bernel&mdash;a flight which
  always took the way to the sea and developed presently into a
  bathing revel wherein she flung cares and clothes to the winds,
  or into a fishing excursion, in which pleasure and profit and
  somewhat of pain were evenly mixed.</p>

  <p>For, though she loved the sea and ate fresh-caught fish with
  as much gusto as any, she hated seeing them caught&mdash;almost
  as much as she hated having her fowls or piglets slaughtered for
  eating purposes, and never would touch them&mdash;a delicacy of
  feeling at which Bernel openly scoffed but could not laugh her
  out of.</p>

  <p>She had sentiments also regarding the rabbits Bernel shot on
  the cliffs, but being wild, and she herself having had no hand in
  their upbringing and not having known them intimately, she
  accepted them as natural provision, though not without
  compunctions at times concerning possible families of orphans
  left totally unprovided for.</p>

  <p>When she did permit herself a few hours off duty she did it
  with a whole-hearted enjoyment&mdash;approaching the na&iuml;ve
  abandon of childhood&mdash;which, to Gard's sober restraint, when
  he was graciously permitted to witness it, was wholly
  charming.</p>

  <p>By degrees, and especially after her father's tragic death,
  Nance's feelings towards the stranger had perceptibly
  changed.</p>

  <p>He might be an alien, an Englishman; but he was at all events
  a Cornishman, and she had heard say that the men of Cornwall and
  of the Islands and of the Bretagne had much in common, just as
  their rugged coasts had. And England, after all, was allied to
  the Islands, belonged to them in fact, and was indeed quite as
  essential a part of the Queen's dominions as the Islands
  themselves, and to harbour unfriendly feeling towards your own
  relations&mdash;unless indeed, as in the case of Tom, they had
  given you ample cause&mdash;would be surely the mark of a small
  and narrow mind.</p>

  <p>And he might be a miner; and mines, and most miners, were
  naturally hateful to her. But he had been a sailor, and was miner
  only by accident as it were, and she knew that he loved the sea.
  Allowance, she supposed, must be made for men getting twists in
  their brains&mdash;like her father. He had gone crazy over these
  mines though he had been sensible enough in other matters.</p>

  <p>What her careful, surreptitious observation of him, from the
  depths and round the wings of her sun-bonnet, told her was that
  he was an upright man, and true, and bold, with a spirit which he
  kept well in hand but which could blaze like lightning on
  occasion, and a strength which he could turn to excellent purpose
  when the need arose.</p>

  <p>And&mdash;and&mdash;she admitted it shyly to herself and not
  without wonder, and found herself dwelling upon it as she sang
  softly to the ping-pang of the milk into the pail, or the swoosh
  of it in the churn&mdash;he thought of her, Nance
  Hamon&mdash;perhaps he even admired her a little&mdash;any way he
  was certainly interested in her, and in his shy reserved way he
  showed a desire for her company which she no longer found
  pleasure in defeating as she had done at first.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly an odd feeling, this, of being cared for by an
  outside man&mdash;- but withal tending to increase of self-esteem
  and therefore not unpleasing.</p>

  <p>Peter Mauger, indeed&mdash;but then she had never looked upon
  Peter as anything but Peter, and the shadow of Tom had always
  obscured him to her. Stephen Gard was a man, and a different kind
  of a man from Peter altogether.</p>

  <p>She remembered, with a slight reddening still of the warm
  brown cheeks whenever she thought of it&mdash;how, on the
  previous Sunday afternoon, she and Bernel had gone running over
  the downs through the waist-high bracken towards Breni&egrave;re,
  the tide in their favourite pool below the rocks being too high
  for bathing. And on the slope above the Cromlech they had come
  suddenly on Gard, lying there looking out over the sea towards
  L'Etat.</p>

  <p>He had jumped up at sight of them and stood hesitating a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Going for a bathe?" he asked, knowing the usual course of
  their proceedings.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we were," said Bernel. "You going?" with a glance at the
  towel Gard had brought out on the chance of a dip.</p>

  <p>"I'd thought of it, but your tides and currents here are so
  troublesome&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we know all about 'em. They're all right when you
  know."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so, but&mdash;" with a look at Nance, "I'll clear
  out."</p>

  <p>"You're not coming?"</p>

  <p>"Your sister wouldn't like it."</p>

  <p>"Nance?" with a look of surprise. "She won't mind. Will you,
  Nance?"</p>

  <p>Then it was her turn to hesitate, for bathing with Bernel was
  one thing, and with Mr. Gard quite another.</p>

  <p>"You'll show me another time, Bernel," said Gard, picking up
  his towel. "I wouldn't like to spoil your fun now."</p>

  <p>"But you wouldn't. Would he, Nance?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mind&mdash;if you'll give me the cave."</p>

  <p>"All the caves you want," said Bernel, scornful at such
  unusual stickling on the part of his chum.</p>

  <p>"Quite sure you don't mind?" asked Gard, doubtful still.</p>

  <p>"If I have the cave. It's generally the one who gets there
  first, and Bern goes quicker than I do."</p>

  <p>"Of course. You're only a girl," laughed Bernel, as he raced
  on down the slope.</p>

  <p>And Nance laughed too at his brotherly depreciation, and Gard,
  who had never regarded her as only a girl, and whose thoughts of
  her were very absorbing and uplifting, happening to catch her
  eye, laughed also, and so they went down towards the sea in
  pleasant enough humour and the nearest approach to
  good-fellowship they had yet attained.</p>

  <p>Nance disappeared round a corner, and the next he saw of her
  she was swimming boldly out towards Breni&egrave;re point, and in
  a moment he and Bernel were after her.</p>

  <p>"Don't go past the point," jerked Bernel.</p>

  <p>"She's gone."</p>

  <p>"She's a fish and knows her way," and just then they ploughed
  into what at first looked to Gard like a perfectly smooth spot
  amid the troubled waters, and then he was lifted from below and
  flung awry and out of his stroke, and tossed and tumbled till he
  felt as helpless as a dead fish. Then a fresh coil of the
  bubbling tide whirled him to one side and he was out again in the
  safety of the dancing waves.</p>

  <p>"You see?" cried Bernel. "That's what it's like," and shot
  into it headlong.</p>

  <p>And Gard, treading water quietly at a safe distance, saw how,
  every here and there, great crowns of water came surging up from
  below, with such lunging force that they rose in some cases
  almost a foot above the neighbouring level of the sea, and he
  wondered how any swimmer could make way through them. And yet
  Nance had cleft them like a seal, and he could hardly make out
  her brown head bobbing among the distant waves.</p>

  <p>"Is it safe for her?" he cried after Bernel, but the boy's
  only reply was a scornful wave of the arm as he pressed on to
  join her.</p>

  <p>Gard had an ample swim, and was dressed and sitting on a rock,
  when they came leisurely in, and it seemed to him that never in
  his life had he seen anything half so pretty as those shining
  coils of chestnut hair with the sea-drops sparkling in them, and
  the bright energetic face below, browned with sun and wind,
  rosy-brown now with her long swim, and beaded like her hair with
  pearly drops.</p>

  <p>As she swept along below, she gave just one quick up-glance,
  and then, with completest ignorance of his presence, turned her
  head to Bernel and chattered away to him with most determined
  nonchalance.</p>

  <p>She and Bernel used the long effective side-stroke almost
  entirely, and the little arm that flashed in and out so
  tirelessly was as white as the garment that fluttered in wavy
  convolutions about the lithe little body below.</p>

  <p>Gard, as he watched her, felt like a discoverer of hidden
  treasure, overwhelmed and intoxicated with the wonder of
  unexpected riches. He had come to this wild little land of Sark
  after silver, and he said to himself that he had found a pearl
  beyond price.</p>

  <p>In a minute or two they were scrambling up the slope and flung
  themselves down beside him for a rest, feeling the strain of
  unusual exertion now that the brace and tonic of the water was
  off them.</p>

  <p>"You are bold swimmers," said Gard.</p>

  <p>"She's a fish in the water," said Bernel, "and she made me
  swim almost as soon as I could walk."</p>

  <p>"You see," said Nance, in her decisive little way, "many of
  our Sark men won't learn to swim. They think it's mistrusting
  God. But that seems to me foolish. Every man who goes down to the
  sea ought to be able to swim&mdash;besides, it's terribly
  nice."</p>

  <p>"Yes, surely, Sark men ought to be able to swim, and they have
  certainly no lack of opportunity. But it's a dangerous coast for
  those who don't know it. Look at that now," and he nodded to the
  foaming race in front of them, between Breni&egrave;re and a
  gaunt rocky peak which rose like a mountain-top out of the lonely
  sea. "Why, it must be running five or six miles an hour."</p>

  <p>From where they sat the sea seemed perfectly calm, a level
  plain of deepest blue, with pale green streaks under the rocks
  and dark purple patches further out, its surface just furrowed
  with tiny wind-ripples, and underneath, a long slow heave like
  the breathings of the spirit of the deep. But, smooth as the blue
  plain seemed, wave met rock with roar and turmoil, and between
  that outlying peak and the shore the waters tore and foamed with
  wild white crests&mdash;tumbling green ridges that were never two
  seconds the same. While all along the great black base of the
  peak the white waves rushed like mighty rockets, flinging long
  white arms up its ragged sides and crashing together at the end
  in dazzling bursts of foam.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" said Gard. "I've lain here for hours watching
  it."</p>

  <p>"I've swum it," said Nance quietly.</p>

  <p>"So've I," said Bernel.</p>

  <p>"Never! You two? I wonder you came back alive!"</p>

  <p>"On the slack it's not so bad, and at half ebb."</p>

  <p>"And what is there to see when you get there?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, just rocks, and puffins and gulls. You can hardly walk
  without stepping on them. Do you remember how we sat and watched
  the baby gulls coming out, Nance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded Nance. "And you nearly got your fingers bitten
  off by a puffin when you felt in its hole."</p>

  <p>"Ma d&eacute;, yes! They do bite."</p>

  <p>"What do you call the rock?" asked Gard, nodding across at
  it.</p>

  <p>"L'Etat," said Nance. "Mr. Cachemaille once told me that it
  had most likely at one time been joined on to Little Sark by a
  Coup&eacute;e, just the same as Little Sark is joined to Sark.
  That's the Coup&eacute;e, that shelf under water where the tide
  runs so fast. Some day, he said, perhaps our Coup&eacute;e will
  go and we'll be an island just as L'Etat is."</p>

  <p>"It won't be this week," said Bernel philosophically.</p>

  <p>"It looks like the top of a high mountain just sticking up out
  of the water," said Gard, fascinated by the ceaseless rush of
  those monstrous waves in an otherwise calm sea.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that is what it is," said Nance. "It's far worse at
  the other end. You can't see it from here. No matter how smooth
  the sea is it seems to tumble down over some cliff under water
  and then come shooting up again, and it throws itself at the
  rocks and sends the spray up into the sky."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to go and see it," said Gard. "But I don't think I
  would like to swim. Could one get a boat?"</p>

  <p>"We have a boat with Nick Mollet in the bay below here," said
  Bernel. "But he's generally out fishing and you're always
  busy."</p>

  <p>"I'll take a holiday some day and you shall take me over."</p>

  <p>Time came when they went, but it was hardly a holiday
  undertaking.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <h3>HOW NANCE CAME UP THE MAIN SHAFT WITHOUT GOING DOWN IT</h3>

  <p>It was a few days after this that Gard had another proof of
  Nance's and Bernel's fearlessness and prowess in the waters they
  had conquered into friendliness.</p>

  <p>Bernel was a great fisherman. He could wheedle out rock-fish
  by the dozen while envious miners sat about him tugging hopefully
  at empty lines.</p>

  <p>He had gone down one afternoon to the overhanging wooden slip
  at Port Gorey, and had excellent sport, until a sudden shift of
  the wind to the south-west began piling the waters into the gulf
  on an incoming tide. Then he drew in his lines and sat dangling
  his legs for a few minutes, before gathering up his catch and
  going home.</p>

  <p>Nance saw him from the other headland and came tripping round
  to see how he had fared.</p>

  <p>"Bern," she cried, as she came up. "Tell that man he's not
  safe down there. The waves are bad there sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Hi, you!" cried Bernel, to a miner who had been watching his
  success and had then climbed down seaward over the furrowed black
  ledges, hoping to do better there. "Come back! It's not safe
  there."</p>

  <p>But the fisherman, intent on his sport, either did not, or
  would not, hear him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, if you won't," said Bernel.</p>

  <p>And then, without warning, a wave greater than any that had
  gone before it, hurled itself up the rocks and came roaring over
  the black ledges into the bay, and the man was gone.</p>

  <p>Nance and Bernel had straightened up instantly at the sound of
  its coming.</p>

  <p>Their eyes swept the rocks, and caught a glimpse of the dark
  body tumbling with the cascade of foam into Port Gorey.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bern!" cried Nance, with up-clasped hands.</p>

  <p>But Bernel, loosing his belt and kicking off his breeches with
  a glance at the derelict, launched himself clear of the pier with
  a shout. And Nance, seeing the bulk of the man, and careless of
  everything but Bernel who seemed so very small compared with him,
  threw off her sun-bonnet and linen jacket, loosed a button, and
  was gone like a white flash after the two of them.</p>

  <p>Gard was in the assay office not far away. He heard the shout
  and ran out just in time to see Nance go, and running to the slip
  he saw their clothes lying and the meaning of it all.</p>

  <p>Bern had hold of the miner by the collar of his coat, and was
  doing his best with one hand to tow him to the shingle at the
  head of the gulf, the almost drowned one splashing wildly and
  doing his utmost to get hold of and drown his rescuer. Every now
  and again Bernel found it necessary to let go in order to keep
  out of his way.</p>

  <p>Nance swam steadily up and the sinking one made a frantic
  clutch at her.</p>

  <p>"Lie quiet or you shall drown," she cried. "Do you hear? Lie
  quiet and you are safe! See!" and she held his right hand while
  Bernel took his left and the man found himself no longer sinking,
  and they struck out for the shingle.</p>

  <p>Others of the miners had run down with ropes, but ropes were
  useless in that deep gulf. Nance and Bernel were doing the only
  thing possible, and Gard saw that they were all right now that
  the man had ceased to struggle.</p>

  <p>He picked up Bernel's things, and Nance's, with a curious
  feeling of delight and a touch of shyness, her sun-bonnet, her
  little linen jacket, her woollen skirt, her neat little wooden
  sabots, and ran swiftly with them to the shaft at the head of the
  gulf.</p>

  <p>They would make for the adit, he thought, and so gain the
  shaft and come up by the ladders, if, indeed, John Thomas was in
  any state to climb ladders.</p>

  <p>"Bring some brandy," he shouted to one of the men, and ran on.
  Nance was more to him than all the miners in Sark, and it was not
  brandy she would be wanting, he knew, but her clothes.</p>

  <p>And, since a man needs both his hands to go down almost
  perpendicular ladders, he left at the top all that she would not
  instantly need and took only the little jacket and the woollen
  skirt. These he rolled into a bundle as he ran, and gripped in
  his teeth as he began the descent, and rejoiced all the way down
  in this close intimacy with her clothing. Indeed, on one of the
  stages, when he stopped for a moment's breathing, he kissed the
  little garments devoutly, and then laughed shamefacedly at
  himself for his foolishness, and glanced round quickly lest any
  should have witnessed it.</p>

  <p>So down, down, till he came to the level, and crept along the
  adit to the shore.</p>

  <p>They had dragged John Thomas up on to the shingle, and he lay
  there half-dead and fuller of water than was his custom.</p>

  <p>Nance looked up quickly at the sound of Gard's feet, and the
  paled-brown of her face flushed red at sight of him, and then a
  grateful gleam lighted it as he dropped her things into her hand
  and bent over John Thomas, who was showing signs of life in a
  dazed and water-logged fashion.</p>

  <p>"You did splendidly, you two," he said to Bernel. "It's a
  grand thing to save a man's life, even if it's only John Thomas,"
  for John Thomas had found this land of free spirits too much for
  him, and had become a soaker and an indifferent workman.</p>

  <p>"He'll be all right after a bit," he added. "I told them to
  send down some brandy," at which John Thomas groaned heavily to
  show his extremity. "As soon as it comes, Bernel, you help Nance
  up the ladders. Then run home both of you. Your things are at the
  top, Bernel. And here comes the brandy. Now, up you go! Do you
  think you can manage the ladders?" he asked Nance.</p>

  <p>"I'll manage them," and they crept away into the darkness of
  the adit, and Nance thought she had never been in such a hideous
  place in her life.</p>

  XIII</h2>

  <h3>HOW GARD REFUSED AN OFFER AND MADE AN ENEMY</h3>

  <p>They had been most gratefully and graciously free from Tom
  since his father's death, but he reappeared a day or two before
  the end of the six weeks, and brought with him a wife from
  Guernsey&mdash;not even a Guernsey woman, however, but a
  Frenchwoman from the Cotentin&mdash;black-haired, black-eyed,
  good-looking, after the type that would please such an one as Tom
  Hamon&mdash;somewhat over-bold of face and manner for the rest of
  the family.</p>

  <p>Philip Tanquerel had had to bring all his sagacity to bear on
  his difficult task of apportioning the lots, and Tom, who knew
  every inch of the ground and all its capacities, grinned
  viciously now and again at the acumen displayed in the
  divisions.</p>

  <p>The allotment of the house-room had presented
  difficulties.</p>

  <p>The great kitchen at La Closerie occupied the whole centre
  third of the ground floor, the remaining thirds of the space on
  each side being taken up with the rarely-used best room and three
  bedrooms, all pretty much of a size, and all opening into the
  kitchen. Up above, under the sloping thatch was the great solie
  or loft, entered from the outside through the door-window in the
  gable by means of a short wooden ladder.</p>

  <p>Grannie's dower rights, when Tom's grandfather died, had
  obtained for her the two rooms constituting one-third of the
  house on the south side of the kitchen, and certain rights of use
  of the kitchen itself. As she needed only one room, she had
  bartered off the other and her kitchen rights to her son and his
  wife in exchange for food and attendance, and the arrangement had
  worked excellently.</p>

  <p>But, on her first glimpse of young Tom's quick-eyed,
  bold-faced Frenchwoman, she had vowed she would have none of her;
  and in the end, as the result of some chaffering, it was arranged
  that Tom and his wife should have the kitchen and all the rooms
  north of it, while Mrs. Hamon and Nance and Bernel had the room
  next Grannie's for a kitchen, and the great loft for bedrooms,
  all the necessary and duly specified alterations to be made at
  Tom's expense, and Mr. Tanquerel to see them carried out at once.
  Grannie's other room was to become their sitting-room also and
  they were to provide for her as hitherto. By boarding up the
  doors leading to the kitchen, and making a new entrance to their
  own rooms, the families were therefore entirely separated, to
  every one's complete satisfaction.</p>

  <p>The division of the furniture and kitchen utensils gave Mrs.
  Hamon all she needed. Tom, of course, took as <i>droit d'ainesse</i>,
  before the division, the family clock&mdash;which still bore
  signs of strife, and had refused to go since that night when
  Gard's buffet had sent him headlong into it; and the farm-ladders
  and the pilotins&mdash;the stone props on which the haystacks
  were built; and in addition to his own full share, as between
  himself and Nance and Bernel, he exacted from them to the
  uttermost farthing the extra seventh part of the value of all
  they received&mdash;an Island right, but honoured more in the
  breach than in the observance, and one which, in its exercise,
  tended to label the exerciser as unduly mean and grasping.</p>

  <p>Beyond that, everything was so fairly well balanced that Tom
  found himself unable to secure all he had hoped, and so deemed
  himself ill-used, and did not hesitate to express himself in his
  usual forcible manner.</p>

  <p>To obtain some of the things he specially wanted, Tanquerel
  had so arranged the lots that he must sacrifice others, and these
  little matters rankled in his mind and obscured his purview.</p>

  <p>There was a good deal of unhappy wrangling, but in the end
  Mrs. Hamon and Nance found themselves with a large cornfield, one
  for pasture, and one for mixed crops, potatoes, beans and so on,
  besides rights of grazing and gorse-cutting on a certain stretch
  of cliff common.</p>

  <p>They had also a pony and two cows, and two pigs and a couple
  of dozen hens and a cock&mdash;quite enough to keep Nance busy;
  and to them also fell an adequate share of the byres and barns,
  and the free use of the well.</p>

  <p>Tom, however, still looked upon them as interlopers, and
  grudged them every stick and stone, and hoof and claw. If they
  had never come into the family all would have been his. Whatever
  they had they had snatched out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>If it had not been for Philip Tanquerel the alterations agreed
  on would never have been completed. He got down the carpenter and
  mason from Sark, stood over them, day by day, till the work was
  done, and then referred them to Tom for payment&mdash;and a
  pleasant and lively time they had in getting it.</p>

  <p>The conditions resulting from all this were just such as have
  prevailed in hundreds of similar cases, such as are almost
  inevitable from the minute divisions and sub-divisions of small
  properties. When ill-feeling has prevailed beforehand it is by no
  means likely to be lessened by the unavoidable friction of such a
  distribution.</p>

  <p>The open ill-feeling was, however, all on Tom's side. The
  others had suffered him at closer quarters the greater part of
  their lives. It was to them a mighty relief to be boarded off
  from him, and to feel free at last from his unwelcome
  incursions.</p>

  <p>He never spoke to any of them, and when they passed one
  another on their various farm duties a black look and a muttered
  curse was his only greeting.</p>

  <p>By means of what fairy tales concerning himself, or his
  position, or Sark, he had induced the lively-eyed Julie to marry
  him, we may not know. But Mrs. Tom very soon let it be known that
  she considered herself woefully misled, and quite thrown away
  upon such a place as Sark, and still more so upon this <i>ultima
  thule</i> of Little Sark, which she volubly asserted was the very
  last place le bon Dieu had made, and the condition in which it
  was left did Him little credit.</p>

  <p>She, at all events, showed no disinclination to chat with her
  neighbours. Very much the contrary. None of them could pass
  within range of her eyes and tongue without a greeting and an
  invitation to talk.</p>

  <p>"Tiens donc, Nancie, ma petite!" she would cry, at sight of
  Nance. "What a hurry you are in. It is hurry and scurry and
  bustle from morning till night with you over there. The hens? Let
  them wait, ma garche, 'twill strengthen their legs to scratch a
  bit, and 'twill enlighten your mind to hear about Guernsey and
  Granville. Oh the beautiful country! Mon Dieu, if only I were
  back there!"</p>

  <p>They all&mdash;except, perhaps, Grannie&mdash;felt for
  her&mdash;lonely in a strange land&mdash;and were inclined to do
  what they could to make her more contented. But she desired them
  chiefly as listeners, and the things she had to tell were little
  to their taste, and less to her credit from their point of view,
  though she herself evidently looked upon them as every-day
  matters, and calculated to inspire these simple island-folk with
  the respect due to a woman of the greater world outside.</p>

  <p>Grannie's views of her grand-daughter-in-law had never altered
  from the first moment she set eyes on her.</p>

  <p>When Mrs. Tom came in to hear herself talk, one afternoon when
  Tom was away fishing, the old lady simply sat and stared at her
  from the depths of her big black sun-bonnet, and never opened her
  lips or gave any sign of interest or hearing.</p>

  <p>"Is she deaf?" asked Mrs. Tom after a while.</p>

  <p>"Dear me, no. Grannie hears everything," said Mrs. Hamon, with
  a smile at thought of all the old lady would have to say
  presently.</p>

  <p>"Nom d'un nom, then why doesn't she speak? Is it dumb she
  is?"</p>

  <p>"Neither deaf nor dumb&mdash;nor yet a fool," rapped Grannie,
  so sharply that the visitor jumped.</p>

  <p>And during the remainder of her visit, no matter to whom she
  was talking or what she was saying, Julie's snapping black eyes
  would inevitably keep working round to the depths of the big
  black sun-bonnet, and at times her discourse lost point and
  trailed to a ragged end.</p>

  <p>"It's my belief that old woman next door is a witch," she said
  to her husband later on.</p>

  <p>"She's an old devil," he said bluntly. "She'll put the evil
  eye on you if you don't take care."</p>

  <p>"She ought to be burnt," said Mrs. Tom.</p>

  <p>"All the same," said Tom musingly, "she's got money, so you'd
  best be as civil to her as she'll let you."</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu! My flesh creeps still at the way she looked at me.
  She has the evil eye without a doubt."</p>

  <p>And Grannie?&mdash;"Mai grand doux! What does a woman like
  that want here?" said she. "A wide mouth and wanton eyes. La
  Closerie has never had these before&mdash;a Frenchwoman
  too!"&mdash;with withering contempt. For, odd as it may seem,
  among this people originally French, and still speaking a patois
  based, like their laws and customs, on the old Norman, there is
  no term of opprobrium more profound than "Frenchman."</p>

  <p>Madame Julie flatly refused to subject herself to further
  peril from Grannie's keen but harmless gaze, and contented
  herself with such opportunities of enlarging Nance's outlook on
  life as casual chats about the farm-yard afforded, and found time
  heavy on her hands.</p>

  <p>Ennui, before long, gave place to grumbling, and that to
  recrimination; and from what the others could not help hearing,
  through the boarded-up doors and the floor of the loft, Tom and
  his wife had a cat-and-dog time of it.</p>

  <p>Gard had moved over to Plaisance with great regret. But
  nothing else was possible under the altered circumstances at La
  Closerie, so he made the best of it.</p>

  <p>It was some consolation to learn that they also missed
  him.</p>

  <p>"Everything's different," grumbled Bernel, one day when they
  met. "Tom and his wife quarrel so that we can hear them through
  the walls. And Grannie sits by the hour without opening her
  mouth. And mother and Nance are as quiet as if they were going to
  be sick. And I'm getting green-mouldy. Seems as if we'd got to
  the end of things, and nothing was ever going to happen again. I
  think I'll go to Guernsey."</p>

  <p>"Do you think they'd like&mdash;I mean, would they mind if I
  came in for a chat now and then? It's pretty lonely up at
  Plaisance too."</p>

  <p>"Oh, they'll mind and so will I. When'll you come?"</p>

  <p>"I'll look in to-night as I come from the mines&mdash;if
  you're sure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You come and try, and if you don't like it you needn't come
  again"&mdash;with a twinkle of the eye.</p>

  <p>Nance did not strike him as looking as though she were going
  to be sick, when he went in that night, nor did her mother.</p>

  <p>Grannie indeed had little to say, but then she was never
  over-talkative, and when Gard more than once looked at her, and
  wondered if she had fallen asleep, he always found the keen old
  eyes wide open, and eyeing him watchfully as ever out of the
  depths of the big black sun-bonnet.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hamon asked about his new quarters, and his quiet shake
  of the head and simple&mdash;"They're kindly folk, but it's
  somehow very different"&mdash;told its own tale.</p>

  <p>"They're a bit short-handed, you see," he added, "and so
  they're all kept busy, and at times, I'm afraid, they wish me
  further."</p>

  <p>"And you go all that way back for your dinner each day?" asked
  Mrs. Hamon thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have tried taking it with me, but it's not very
  satisfactory."</p>

  <p>"What would you say to coming here for it, as you used to? I
  think we could manage it, Nance. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"We could manage it all right," said Nance, "if&mdash;" and
  then, in spite of herself, she could not keep that telltale mouth
  of hers in order, and the attempt to repress a smile only
  emphasized the dimples at the corners. For Gard's face was as
  eager as a dog's at sight of a rat.</p>

  <p>"It will save me such a lot of time," he explained&mdash;at
  which Nance dimpled again as she went out to feed her chickens,
  and left them to complete the new arrangement.</p>

  <p>And if it had cost Gard every penny of his salary he would
  still have rejoiced at it, and considered his bargain a good one.
  As it was, it cost him no more than the trouble of rearranging
  his terms with the good folks at Plaisance, and it gave a new
  zest and enjoyment to life since it ensured a meeting with Nance
  at least once each day.</p>

  <p>And not with Nance only!</p>

  <p>Madame Julie, very weary of herself, and Tom, and her
  surroundings, and Sark, and life in general as understood in
  Sark, very soon became conscious of the regular visits next door
  of the best-looking young man she had yet seen in the Island, and
  was filled with curiosity concerning him.</p>

  <p>"He's after that slip of a Nance," she said to herself. "And
  he has his own share of good looks, has that young
  man."&mdash;And then came the inevitable, "Mon Dieu, but I wish
  Tom had been made like that!"</p>

  <p>To get a better view of him&mdash;and perhaps not without a
  vague idea of ulterior interest and amusement for
  herself&mdash;anything to add a dash of colour to the prevailing
  greyness of her surroundings&mdash;she was leaning on the gate
  next day when he came striding up to his dinner, and gave him,
  "Bon jour, m'sieur!" with much heartiness and the full benefit of
  her black eyes and white teeth.</p>

  <p>"'Jour, madame!" and he whipped off his hat and passed on into
  the house.</p>

  <p>"That was Madame Tom, I suppose, who was leaning over the
  gate, as I came in," he said, as they ate.</p>

  <p>"I expect so," said Mrs. Hamon. "She generally seems to have
  time on her hands."</p>

  <p>"When Tom's not there," snapped Grannie. "Got her hands full
  enough when he is."</p>

  <p>"I should imagine Tom would not be too easy to get on with at
  times. Maybe he'll settle down now he's married."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't sound like settling down sometimes," chirped the old
  lady again.</p>

  <p>"Oh? I'm sorry to hear that. She doesn't look
  bad-tempered."</p>

  <p>"Tom's got more'n enough for the two of them."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid she finds it a change from what she's been
  accustomed to," said Mrs. Hamon quietly. "She came in once or
  twice, but her talk is of things that don't interest us, and ours
  is of things that don't interest her, so we can't get as friendly
  as we would like to be."</p>

  <p>"And Tom?"</p>

  <p>"Tom considers us all robbers, as he always has done. He gives
  us his blackest face whenever he sees any of us."</p>

  <p>"That's unpleasant, seeing you're such close neighbours."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's unpleasant, but we can't help it. It's just Tom.
  How is your work getting on?"</p>

  <p>"Not as I would wish," said Gard, with a gloomy wag of the
  head. "Your Sark men are difficult&mdash;very difficult, and the
  others who ought to know better, and who do know
  better"&mdash;with more than a touch of warmth&mdash;"go on as
  though I was a slave-driver."</p>

  <p>"Sark men are hard to drive," said Mrs. Hamon
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"They know perfectly well that I want only what is just and
  right to the shareholders. They expect their pay to the last
  penny, but when I insist on a proper return for it they look at
  me as if they'd like to knock me on the head. It's disheartening
  work. I've been tempted at times to throw it all up and go back
  to England"&mdash;at which Nance's heart gave so unusual a little
  kick that she had difficulty in frowning it into quietude, and
  just then Bernel came in with his gun and a couple of
  rabbits.</p>

  <p>"Who's going to England?" he asked. "I'll go too."</p>

  <p>"No you won't," said Nance sharply. "We want you here."</p>

  <p>"It's as dull as Beauregard pond and as dirty, since the
  m&mdash;aw&mdash;um!" with a deprecatory glance at Gard.</p>

  <p>"You'd find most busy places just as dirty," said Gard.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll go to sea. That's clean at all events."</p>

  <p>"Let's hope things will brighten a bit. You wouldn't find the
  fo'c'sle of a trader as comfortable as La Closerie, my
  boy,"&mdash;and they fell to on their dinner and left the matter
  there.</p>

  <p>"Dites-donc, Nannon, ma petite," said Mrs. Tom to Nance, a day
  or two later, "who is the joli gars who comes each day to see
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gard from the mines comes up here to get his dinner, if
  that's what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;ho! He comes for his dinner, does he? And is that
  all he comes for, little Miss Modesty?"</p>

  <p>"That's all," said Nance solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, without a doubt, that's all. I think I'll ask him
  next time I see him. Why doesn't he go home for his dinner like
  other people?"</p>

  <p>"He's living at Plaisance now and it's far to go. He used to
  live here, you know."</p>

  <p>"Ma foi, no, I didn't know. He used to live here? And why did
  he go to Plaisance then?"</p>

  <p>"We hadn't room for him, you see."</p>

  <p>"But, Mon Dieu, we have room and to spare! There are those two
  bedrooms empty. Why shouldn't he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Nance shook her head at that.</p>

  <p>"Why then?" demanded Mrs. Tom, with visions of some one
  besides Tom to talk to of an evening&mdash;a good-looking,
  sensible one too. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"He and Tom don't get on well together&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardi, I'm not surprised at that. It would need an angel out
  of heaven to get on with him sometimes. What induced me ever to
  marry such a grumbler I don't know. I wonder if Monsieur
  What-is-it?&mdash;Gard&mdash;would come back if I could arrange
  it?"</p>

  <p>But Nance shook her head again.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;ha, ma garche, and you would sooner he did
  not&mdash;is it not so?"</p>

  <p>"I'm quite sure he and Tom would never get on together, and I
  don't think Mr. Gard would come."</p>

  <p>"It's worth trying, however. He would be some one to talk to
  of an evening any way."</p>

  <p>And so, when Tom came in that evening, she tackled him on the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"Say then, mon beau,"&mdash;and as she said it she could not
  but contrast his slouching bulk with the straight, well-knit
  figure of the other&mdash;"why should we not take in a lodger as
  all the rest do? Our two rooms there are empty and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who's the lodger?"</p>

  <p>"There is one comes up every day to dinner next door, and
  would stop there altogether if they had the room. Tiens, what's
  this his name is? He's from the mines&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean Gard&mdash;the manager," scowled Tom.</p>

  <p>"That's it&mdash;Monsieur Gard. Why shouldn't he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because I'd break his head if I got the chance, and he knows
  it. Comes up there to dinner, does he? How long's he been doing
  that?"</p>

  <p>"For a week now. Couldn't you get over your bad feeling? It
  would be money in our pockets."</p>

  <p>"No, I couldn't, and he wouldn't come if you asked him."</p>

  <p>"Will you let me try?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you he won't come."</p>

  <p>"In that case there's no harm in trying. If I can persuade
  him, will you promise to be civil to him, and not try to break
  his head?"</p>

  <p>"He won't come, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"And I say he may."</p>

  <p>"And you'll nag and nag till you get your own way, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>"Of course. What's the use of a woman's tongue if she can't
  get her own way with it? Will you promise to behave properly if
  he comes?"</p>

  <p>"I'll behave if he behaves," he growled sulkily. "But we'll
  neither of us get the chance. He won't come."</p>

  <p>"Eh bien, we'll see!"</p>

  <p>And when Gard came up to dinner next day, she was leaning over
  the gate waiting for him, very tastefully dressed according to
  her lights, and with an engaging smile on her face.</p>

  <p>"Dites donc, Monsieur Gard," she said pleasantly. "Our little
  Nannon was telling me you regretted having to live so far away.
  Why should you not come back and occupy your old room? It is
  lying empty there, and I would do my very best to make you
  comfortable, and you would be close to your friends all the time
  then, instead of having to go across that frightful
  Coup&eacute;e."</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of you, madame," and he stared back at her in
  much surprise, and found himself wondering what on earth had made
  her marry such a man as Tom Hamon. For she was undeniably
  good-looking and had all a Frenchwoman's knack of making the very
  best of all she had&mdash;abundant black hair, very neatly
  twisted up at the back of her head; white teeth and full red
  lips; straight, well-developed figure very neatly dressed; and
  large black eyes which looked capable of so many things, that
  they found it difficult to settle for any length of time to any
  one expression.</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of you, madame," said Gard, "but&mdash;" and
  he stood looking at her and hesitating how to put it.</p>

  <p>"You mean about Tom," she laughed. "But that is all past. I
  have spoken to him, and he promises to behave himself quite
  properly if you will come. Voil&agrave;!"</p>

  <p>Just for a moment the possibilities of the suggestion caught
  his mind. He would be near Nance all the time. He would be saved
  much tiresome walking to and fro. Especially he would be saved
  that passage of the Coup&eacute;e, which at night, even with a
  lantern, was not a thing one easily got accustomed to, and on
  stormy nights was enough to make one's hair fly. Then this woman
  was very different from his present landlady, and would probably,
  he thought, have different notions of comfort.</p>

  <p>The quick black eyes caught something of what was in him: and
  he, as suddenly, caught something of what lurked, consciously or
  unconsciously, in them, and a little tremor of repugnance shook
  his heart and braced him back to reason.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "It would not do, madame. He and I would
  never get on together, no matter how hard we tried. I thank you
  for the offer all the same," and he made as though to pass
  her.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would come," she said, and laid a pleading hand on
  his arm. "I'm sure he would try to behave. I can generally manage
  him except when he's been drinking. Then I'm afraid of him, and
  wish some one else was at hand. But that's only when he's been
  out all night at the fishing, and it's soon over and done with.
  Do come, monsieur!"&mdash;It was almost a whisper now, and she
  leaned towards him&mdash;the rich dark face&mdash;the great
  solicitous eyes.</p>

  <p>But she had mistaken her man. Perhaps she had not met many
  like him.</p>

  <p>He shook off her hand almost brusquely.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible, madame. I could not," and he pushed past
  just as Nance came to the door.</p>

  <p>She had seen him coming, heard their voices outside, and
  wondered what was keeping him.</p>

  <p>She turned back into the house when she saw Julie, wondering
  still more. For Gard's face was disturbed, and had in it
  something of the look she had seen more than once when he had
  faced Tom in his tantrums.</p>

  <p>And, glancing past him, she had seen what he had
  not&mdash;Julie's face when he turned his back on her.</p>

  <p>"Mon Gyu!" gasped Nance to herself, and went in wondering.</p>

  <p>"She and Tom wanted me to take my old room again, and I
  refused," was all he said.</p>

  <p>"Tom wanted you to go there?" said Mrs. Hamon in
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"So she said."</p>

  <p>Grannie's disparaging sniff was charged with libel.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Tom of his wife, when he came in later on with
  Peter Mauger, who had come over for supper. "Got your
  lodger?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"That's what I told you," with a provocative laugh.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he'd have come quick enough."</p>

  <p>"Would, would he? Then why didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't trust myself alone in the house with that
  man."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Tom, staring at her. "Always thought he was a bad
  lot myself, didn't I, Peter?"</p>

  <p>Peter nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder to me that Mrs. Hamon lets him run after that
  girl of hers as she does," said Julie.</p>

  <p>"If I catch him up to any of his tricks I'll break his head
  for him."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it would be a good thing for little Nance if you
  did."</p>

  <p>"Knew he was a toad as soon as I set eyes on him, so did
  Peter. Didn't you, Peter?"</p>

  <p>Peter nodded.</p>

  <p>"What d'he say to you?" demanded Tom.</p>

  <p>"Didn't say much. Asked if you were much away at the fishing
  and that. But the way he looked at me!&mdash;I've got the shivers
  down my back yet," and a virtuous little shudder shook her and
  made a visible impression on Peter.</p>

  <p>"Peter and me'll maybe have a word with him one of these days,
  won't we, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"We don't want toads like Gard running off with any of our
  Sark girls, do we, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gard had better look out for himself or take himself off
  before somebody does it for him. There's plenty wouldn't mind
  giving him a crack on the head and slipping him over the
  Coup&eacute;e some dark night."</p>

  <p>As to such extreme measures Peter offered no opinion. He
  looked vaguely round the big kitchen as though in search of
  something that used to be there, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"How about supper?"</p>

  <h3>HOW THEY WENT THROUGH THE DARKNESS OF THE NARROW WAY</h3>

  <p>One dark night Gard sauntered down the cutting towards the
  Coup&eacute;e, enjoying a last pipe before turning in.</p>

  <p>This had become something of a habit with him. The people of
  Plaisance, hard at work all day in the fields, went early to bed
  and left him to follow when he pleased. And to stand securely in
  that deep cleft, just where the protecting walls broke off short
  and left the narrow path to waver on into the darkness, was
  always fascinating to him.</p>

  <p>When the moon flooded the gulf on the left with shimmering
  silver, and the waves broke along the black rocks below in crisp
  white foam like silver frost, he would stand by the hour there
  and never tire of it.</p>

  <p>The moon cast such a mystic glamour over those great voids of
  darkness and over the headlands, melting softly away, fold behind
  fold, on the right, while Little Sark became a mystery land into
  which the white path rambled enticingly and invited one to
  follow.</p>

  <p>And to him, as his eyes followed it till it disappeared over
  the crown of the ridge, it was more than a mystery land&mdash;a
  land of promise, rich in La Closerie and Nance.</p>

  <p>Always within him, as he watched, was the feeling that if the
  sweet slim figure should come tripping down the moonlit path
  towards him, he would be in no way astonished. When he stood
  there, watching, it seemed to him that it would be entirely
  fitting for her to come so, in the calm soft light that was as
  pure and sweet as herself.</p>

  <p>And at times his eye would light on the grim black pile of
  L'Etat, lying out there in the silvery shimmer like some great
  monumental cairn, a rough and rugged heap of loneliness and
  mystery&mdash;the grimmer and lonelier by reason of the twinkling
  brightness of its setting. And then his thoughts would play about
  the lonely pile, and come back with a sense of homely relief to
  the fairy path which Nance's little feet had trod, in light and
  dark, and storm and shine, since ever she could walk.</p>

  <p>He pictured her as a tiny girl running fearlessly across the
  grim pathway to school, dancing in the sunshine, bending to the
  storm, and all alone when she had been kept in&mdash;he wondered
  with a smile what she had been kept in for.</p>

  <p>He thought of her, as he had seen her, walking to church, her
  usually blithe spirit tuned to sedateness by the very fact, and,
  to him, delightfully stiffened by the further fact that she,
  almost alone among her friends and school-fellows, wore Island
  costume, while all the rest flaunted it in all the colours of the
  rainbow. And he laughed happily to himself, for very joy, at
  thought of the sweet elusive face in the shadow of the great
  sun-bonnet. There was not a face in all Sark to compare with it,
  nor, for him, in all the world.</p>

  <p>But this night, as be stood there pulling slowly at his pipe
  and thinking of Nance, was one of the black nights.</p>

  <p>Later on there would be a remnant of a moon, but as yet the
  sky above was an ebon vault without a star, and the gulfs at his
  feet were pits of darkness out of which rose the voices of the
  sea in solemn rhythmic cadence.</p>

  <p>Down in Grande Gr&egrave;ve, on his right, the waves rolled in
  almost without a sound, as though they feared to disturb the
  darkness. From the intervening moments he could tell how slowly
  they crept to their curve. Their fall was a soft sibilation, a
  long-drawn sigh. The ever-restless sea for once seemed falling to
  sleep.</p>

  <p>And then, as he listened into the darkness, a tiny elfish
  glimmer flickered in the void below, flickered and was gone, and
  he rubbed his eyes for playing him tricks. But the next wave
  broke slowly round the wide curve of the bay in a crescent of
  lambent flame, and a flood of soft, blue-green fire ran swelling
  up the beach and then with a sigh drew slowly back, and all was
  dark again. Again and again&mdash;each wave was a miracle of
  mystic beauty, and he stood there entranced long after his pipe
  had gone dead.</p>

  <p>And as he stood gazing down at the wonder of it, his ear
  caught the sound of quick light footsteps coming towards him
  across the Coup&eacute;e, and he marvelled at the intrepidity of
  this late traveller. If he had had to go across there that night,
  he would have gone step by step, with caution and a lantern;
  whereas here was no hesitation, but haste and assurance.</p>

  <p>It was only when she had passed the last bastion, and was
  almost upon him, that he made out that it was a girl.</p>

  <p>His heart gave a jump. She had been so much in his thought.
  Yet, even so, it was almost at a venture that he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Nance?"</p>

  <p>And yet, again, he had learned to recognize her footsteps at
  the farm, and where the heart is given the senses are subtly
  acute, and she had slackened her pace somewhat as she drew
  near.</p>

  <p>"Yes; I am going to the doctor."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;who&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Grannie is ill&mdash;in pain. He will give me something to
  ease her." He had turned and was walking by her side.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry. You will let me go with you?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need at all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No need, I know; but all the same it would be a pleasure to
  me to see you safely there and back."</p>

  <p>She hurried on without speaking. If there had been any light,
  and he had dared to peep inside the black sun-bonnet, he might
  perhaps have found the hint of a smile overlaying her anxiety on
  Grannie's account.</p>

  <p>By the ampler feel of things, and the easing of the slope, he
  knew they were out of the cutting, and presently they were
  passing Plaisance.</p>

  <p>"If you would sooner I did not walk with you, I will fall
  behind; but I couldn't stop here and think of you going on
  alone," he said.</p>

  <p>"That would be foolishness," she said gently. "But there is
  really no need. I have no fears of ghosts or anything like
  that."</p>

  <p>"There might be other kinds of spirits about," he said
  quietly. "And when men drink as some of my fellows do, they are
  no respecters of persons. But this is surely very sudden. Your
  grandmother seemed all right at dinner-time."</p>

  <p>"She had bad pains in the afternoon, and they have been
  getting worse. She did not want to have the doctor, but the
  things she took did her no good, and mother said I had better go
  and ask him for something more."</p>

  <p>"And where is Bernel?"</p>

  <p>"He went to the fishing with Billy Mollet, and he was not
  back."</p>

  <p>"And suppose the doctor is not in?"</p>

  <p>"They will know where he is, and I will go after him."</p>

  <p>"Did you see those wonderful waves of fire as you came across
  the Coup&eacute;e?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen them often. When there is more sea on, and it
  breaks on the rocks, it is finer still. It is something in the
  water, Mr. Cachemaille told me."</p>

  <p>"I heard your footsteps down there on the Coup&eacute;e, but I
  couldn't see a sign of you till you were almost against me."</p>

  <p>"I saw from the other side that some one was there, but I
  could not see who."</p>

  <p>"You have most wonderful eyes in Sark."</p>

  <p>"It is never quite dark to me on the darkest night. I suppose
  it is with being used to it."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to help me across the Coup&eacute;e."</p>

  <p>"And how will you get back?"</p>

  <p>"The moon will be up, and then I can see all right. I don't
  need much light, but I've not been brought up to see through
  solid black."</p>

  <p>The doctor was fortunately in, and knew by ample experience
  what would ease Grannie's pains. So presently they were hurrying
  back along the dark road.</p>

  <p>As they turned the corner by Vauroque an open doer cast a
  great shaft of light across the darkness, and there, just as on a
  previous occasion, on the wall lounged half-a-dozen men, and
  among them was Tom Hamon, who had come up to have a drink with
  his friend Peter.</p>

  <p>At sight of him, Nance bent her head and tried to shrink into
  herself as she hurried past.</p>

  <p>But Tom had seen her, and the sight of her alone with Gard at
  that time of night roused the virtuous indignation, and other
  more potent spirits, within him.</p>

  <p>He sprang down into the road, shouting what sounded like a
  spate of curses in the patois.</p>

  <p>Gard stopped and turned, with a keen recollection of the same
  thing having happened before. He remembered too how that occasion
  ended.</p>

  <p>But Nance laid an entreating hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Please&mdash;don't!"</p>

  <p>Her voice sounded a little strange to him. If he had been able
  to see her face now he would have found it pallid, in spite of
  its usual healthy brown bloom.</p>

  <p>She stood entreatingly till he turned and went on with
  her.</p>

  <p>"He is evidently aching for another thrashing," he said
  grimly, as he stalked beside her.</p>

  <p>And presently they were in the cutting, and the unnerving
  vastness of the gulfs opened out on either side. Gard felt like a
  blindfolded man stumbling along a plank.</p>

  <p>He involuntarily put out a groping hand and took hold of her
  cloak. A little hand slipped out of the cloak and took his in
  charge, and so they went through the darkness of the narrow
  way.</p>

  <p>He breathed more freely when the further slope was reached,
  and only then became aware that the hand that held his was all of
  a tremble. The next moment he perceived that she was sobbing
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"Nance!" he cried. "What is it? You are crying. Is it anything
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no, no!" sobbed the wounded soul convulsively.</p>

  <p>"What then? Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot. I cannot."</p>

  <p>"Nance&mdash;dear!" and he sought her hand again and stood
  holding it firmly. "It is like stabs in my heart to hear you
  sobbing. I would give my life to save you from trouble. Do you
  believe me, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you can trust me, dear, can you not? You distrusted me at
  first, I know, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I do trust you, and I know you are good. And it is that
  that makes it so wicked of him to say such things about
  us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In her excitement she had let slip more than she intended. She
  stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Tom?"</p>

  <p>She did not speak, but the wound welled open in another
  sob.</p>

  <p>"Don't trouble about him, dear! I don't know what he said, but
  if it was meant to make you doubt me, it was not true. You are
  more to me than anything in the world, Nance, and I have never
  loved any other woman&mdash;except my mother. Do you believe
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;oh, yes! I cannot help believing you. Oh, I wish
  sometimes that Tom was dead. When I was very little I used to
  pray each night to God to kill him."</p>

  <p>"I'll teach him to leave you alone."</p>

  <p>"I must go now. Grannie is waiting for her medicine."</p>

  <p>He took the little hand under his arm and pressed it close to
  his side, and they pushed on down the dark lanes till they came
  in sight of the lights of La Closerie.</p>

  <p>Then he bent into the sun-bonnet and sealed his capture of the
  virginal fortress by a passionate kiss on the tremulous little
  lips. And she, with the frankness of a child, reached up and
  kissed him warmly back.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, dear, and God bless you!" he said fervently.</p>

  <p>"Can you find your way in the dark?"</p>

  <p>"There is the moon. I shall be all right."</p>

  <p>She bent her head and ran on towards the lights. He watched
  her go in at the door, and turned and went back along the lane,
  and his heart was high with the joy that was in him.</p>

  <h3>HOW TWO FELL OUT</h3>

  <p>It was but a thin strip of a moon that had risen above the
  evening mists&mdash;a mere sickle of red gold&mdash;but such as
  it was it sufficed to lift the pall of darkness from the earth
  and set the black sky back into its proper place.</p>

  <p>To Gard the night had suddenly become spacious and ample, and
  the peaceful slip of a moon, which grew paler and brighter every
  minute, was full of promise.</p>

  <p>He was so full of Nance that he had almost forgotten Tom and
  his scurrilous insolences.</p>

  <p>He crossed the Coup&eacute;e without any difficulty, enjoyed
  over again the recollection of that last crossing, and stood in
  the cutting on the Sark side for a moment to marvel at the change
  an hour had made in his outlook on things in general.</p>

  <p>Tom? Why, he could almost forgive Tom, for it was he who had
  helped to bring matters to a head&mdash;unconsciously, indeed,
  and probably quite against his wish. Still, he had been the
  instrument&mdash;the drop of acid in the solution which had
  crystallized their love into set form and made it visible, and
  fixed it for life.</p>

  <p>Truly, he was half inclined to consider himself under
  obligation to Tom&mdash;if only his boorishness could be kept in
  check for the future. For, of a certainty, he was not going to
  allow Nance to be made miserable by his loutish insolences.</p>

  <p>He had climbed the cutting and was on the level, when he heard
  heavy footsteps coming towards him, and the next moment he was
  face to face with the object of his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Possibly Tom had expected to meet him and had been preparing
  for the fray, for he opened at once with a volley of patois which
  to Gard was so much blank cartridge.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;ho, le velas&mdash;corrupteur! Amuseur!
  S&eacute;ducteur! Ou quais noutre fille? Quais qu'on avait fait
  d'elle d'on?"</p>

  <p>"Quite finished?" asked Gard quietly, as the other came to a
  stop for want of breath. "Say it all over again in English, and
  I'll know what you're talking about."</p>

  <p>"English be&mdash;&mdash;!" he broke out afresh, in a turgid
  mixture of tongues. "S&eacute;ducteur, amuseur! Where's our
  Nance? Gaderabotin, what have you done with the girl? I know you,
  corrupteur! Running after men's wives&mdash;and our Nance, too!
  See then&mdash;you touch la garche and I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"See here! We've had enough of this," said Gard, gripping him
  by the shoulders and shaking him. "If you weren't drunk I'd
  thrash you within an inch of your life, you brute. Come back when
  you're sober, and I'll give you a lesson in manners."</p>

  <p>Tom had been struggling to get his arms up. At last he
  wrenched himself free and came on like a bull. One of his
  flailing fists caught Gard across the face, flattening his nose
  and filling one eye with stars; the other hand, trying to grip
  his opponent, ripped open his coat, tearing away both button and
  cloth.</p>

  <p>"You lout!" cried Gard, his blood up and dripping also from
  his nose. "If you must have it, you shall;" and he squared up to
  him to administer righteous punishment.</p>

  <p>And then the futility of it came upon him. The man was
  three-parts drunk, in no condition for a fight, scarce able to
  attempt even to defend himself.</p>

  <p>No punishment of Tom drunk would have the slightest moral
  effect on Tom sober. He would remember nothing about it in the
  morning, except that he had been knocked about.</p>

  <p>When he received his next lesson in deportment it was Gard's
  earnest desire and hope that it might prove a lasting and final
  one.</p>

  <p>So he decided to postpone it, and contented himself with
  warding and dodging his furious lunges and rushes, and gave him
  no blow in return. Until, at last, after one or two heavy falls
  of his own occasioning, Tom gave it up, spluttered a final
  commination on his opponent, and turned to go home.</p>

  <p>He went blunderingly down into the hollow way, and Gard stood
  watching him in doubt.</p>

  <p>It seemed hardly possible he could cross the Coup&eacute;e in
  that state, and he felt a sort of moral responsibility towards
  him. Much as he detested him, he had no wish to see him go
  reeling over into Coup&eacute;e bay.</p>

  <p>So he set off after him to see him safely across, and Tom,
  hearing him coming, groped in the crumbling side wall till he
  found a rock of size, and sent it hurling up the path with
  another curse.</p>

  <p>Then he blundered on, and Gard followed. And Tom stopped again
  by one of the pinnacles and sought another rock, and flung it,
  and it dropped slowly from point to point till it landed on the
  shingle three hundred feet below.</p>

  <p>He stood there in the dim light, cursing volubly in patois and
  shaking his fist at Gard; but at last, to Gard's great relief, he
  humped his back and stumbled away up the cutting on the further
  side.</p>

  <p>And Gard, very sick of it all, and with an aching head and a
  very tender nose, but withal with a warm glow at the heart which
  no aches or pains could damp down, turned and went home to
  bed.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <h3>HOW ONE FELL OVER</h3>

  <p>Gard's first waking thoughts next morning were of Nance
  entirely.</p>

  <p>He would see her at dinner-time. How would he find her? Last
  night the disturbance of her feelings had shaken her out of
  herself somewhat, and shown her to him in new and delightful
  lights.</p>

  <p>If, this morning, she should be to some extent withdrawn again
  into her natural modest shell, he would not be surprised; and he
  made up his mind, then and there, to be in no wise disappointed.
  Last night was a fact, a delightful fact, on which to build the
  rosy future.</p>

  <p>It was a long time to wait till dinner-time to see her. What
  if he went round that way, before going to work, just to inquire
  if Tom got home all right.</p>

  <p>And then the feeling of discomfort in his eye and nose, as
  though the one had shrunk to the size of a pin-point and the
  other had grown to the bulk of a turnip&mdash;brought back the
  whole matter, and on further consideration he decided not to go
  to the farm till the proper time. If he came across Tom, the fray
  would inevitably be resumed at once, and his right eye, at the
  moment, showed a decided disinclination to open to its usual
  extent, or to perform any of the functions properly demanded of a
  right eye contemplating battle.</p>

  <p>He must get up at once and bathe it and bring it to
  reason.</p>

  <p>Raw beef, he believed, was the correct treatment under the
  circumstances. But raw beef was almost as obtainable as raw moon,
  and even raw mutton he did not know where he could procure, nor
  whether it would answer the purpose.</p>

  <p>So he bathed his bruises with much water, and reduced their
  excesses to some extent, but not enough to escape the eye of his
  hostess when he appeared at breakfast.</p>

  <p>"Bin fighting?" she queried dispassionately.</p>

  <p>"A one-sided fight. Tom Hamon was drunk last night and hit me
  in the face, but he was not in a condition to fight or I'd have
  taught him better manners."</p>

  <p>"He's a rough piece," with a disparaging shake of the head.
  "It'd take a lot to knock him into shape. Try this," and she
  delved among her stores, and found him an ointment of her own
  compounding which took some of the soreness out of his
  bruises.</p>

  <p>But black eyes and swollen noses are impertinently obtrusive
  and disdainful of disguise, and the captain's battle-flags
  provoked no little jocosity among his men that morning.</p>

  <p>"Run up against su'then, cap'n?" asked John Hamon the
  engineer, who was one of the few who sided with him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, against a drunken fist in the dark. When it's sober I'm
  going to give it a lesson in manners."</p>

  <p>"Drunken fisses is hard to teach. You'll have your hands full,
  cap'n."</p>

  <p>It seemed an unusually long morning, but dinner-time came at
  last and he hastened across to the farm, eager for the first
  sight of the sweet shy face hiding in the big sun-bonnet.</p>

  <p>Quite contrary to his expectations Nance came hurrying to meet
  him. She had evidently been on the watch for him. Still more to
  his surprise, her face, instead of that look of shy reserve which
  he had been prepared for, was full of anxious questioning. The
  large dark eyes were full of something he had never seen in them
  before.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;Nance&mdash;dear! What is the matter?" he asked
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"Did you meet Tom again last night? Oh," at nearer sight of
  his bruised face, "you did, you did!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear, I did. Or rather he met me&mdash;as you see."</p>

  <p>"Did you fight with him?" she panted.</p>

  <p>"He was too drunk to fight. He ran at me and gave me this, and
  my first inclination was to give him a sound thrashing. Then I
  saw it would be no good, in the condition he was in, so I just
  kept him at arm's length till he tired of it. He went off at
  last, and I was so afraid he might tumble off the Coup&eacute;e
  that I followed him, and he hurled rocks at me whenever he came
  to a stand. But he got across all right, and I went back and went
  to bed. Now, what's all the trouble about?"</p>

  <p>"He never came home," she jerked, with a catch in her voice
  which thought only of Tom had never put there.</p>

  <p>"Never came home?"</p>

  <p>"And they're all out looking for him."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he went back to Peter Mauger's.... If he tried to
  cross that Coup&eacute;e again&mdash;in the condition he was
  in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He didn't go back to Peter's. Julie went there first of all
  to ask."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, what can have become of him?"</p>

  <p>The answer came unexpectedly round the corner of the
  house&mdash;Julie Hamon, in a state of utmost dishevelment and
  agitation, which turned instantly to venomous fury at the sight
  of Gard and Nance.</p>

  <p>Her black hair seemed all a-bristle. Her black eyes flamed.
  Her dark face worked like a quicksand. Her skirts were wet to the
  waist. Her jacket was open at the top, as though she had wrenched
  at it in a fit of choking. Her strong bare throat throbbed
  convulsively. Her hands, half closed at her side, looked as
  though they wanted something to claw.</p>

  <p>"Did you do it?" she cried hoarsely, stalking up to Gard.</p>

  <p>"Do what?"</p>

  <p>"Kill him."</p>

  <p>"Tom?... You don't mean to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You ought to know. He's there in the school-house, broken to
  a jelly and his head staved in. And they say it's you he fought
  with last night. The marks of it are on your face"&mdash;her
  voice rose to a scream&mdash;"Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!"</p>

  <p>"You wicked&mdash;thing!" cried Nance, pale to the lips.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;you!" foamed Julie. "You're as bad as he
  is. Because my man tried to save you from
  that&mdash;murderer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you&mdash;wicked!&mdash;You're crazy," cried Nance,
  rushing at her as though to make an end of her.</p>

  <p>And Julie, mad with the strain of the night's anxieties and
  their abrupt and terrible ending, uncurled her claws and struck
  at her with a snarl&mdash;tore off her sun-bonnet, and would have
  ripped up her face, if Gard had not flung his arms round her from
  the back and dragged her screaming and kicking towards her own
  door.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hamon had come running out at sound of the fray. Gard
  whirled the mad woman into her own house and Mrs. Hamon followed
  her and closed the door.</p>

  <p>Gard turned to look for Nance.</p>

  <p>She was nervously trying to tie on her sun-bonnet by one
  string.</p>

  <p>"Nance, dear," he said, "you don't believe I had anything to
  do with this?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, no! I'm sure you hadn't. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But?" he asked, looking down into the pale face and bright
  anxious eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they may say you did it. They will think it. They are
  sure to think it, and they are so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't trouble about it, dear. I know no more about it than
  you do, and they cannot get beyond that. Promise me you won't let
  it trouble you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I will try. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Have no fears on my account, Nance. I will go at once and
  tell them all I know about it."</p>

  <p>He pressed her hands reassuringly, and she went into the house
  with downcast head and a face full of forebodings, and he set off
  at once for Sark.</p>

  <h3>HOW TOM WENT TO SCHOOL FOR THE LAST TIME</h3>

  <p>Mrs. Tom had had a troubled night. Anxiety at her husband's
  continued absence had in due time given way to anger, and anger
  in its turn to anxiety again.</p>

  <p>In a state of mind compounded of these wearing emotions, she
  had set out in the early morning to find out what had become of
  him; if he was sleeping off a drunken debauch at Peter Mauger's,
  to give them both a vigorous piece of her mind; if he was not
  there, to find out where he was; in any case to vent on some one
  the pent-up feelings of the night.</p>

  <p>Vigorous hammering on Peter Mauger's door produced first his
  old housekeeper, and presently himself, heavy-eyed, dull-witted,
  and in flagrant dishabille, since Mrs. Guille had but a moment
  ago shaken him out of the sleep of those who drink not wisely
  over-night, with the information that a crazy woman wanted him at
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Where's Tom?" demanded Julie, ready to empty the vials of her
  wrath on the delinquent as soon as he was produced.</p>

  <p>But Peter's manner at once dissipated that expectation.</p>

  <p>"Tom?" he said vaguely, and gazed at her with a bovine
  stupidity that jarred her strained nerves like a blow.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Tom&mdash;my husband, fool! Where is he?" she asked
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" scratching his tousled head to quicken his
  wits. "I d'n know."</p>

  <p>"You don't know? What did you do with him last night, you
  drunken fool?"&mdash;by this time the neighbours had come out to
  learn the news.</p>

  <p>Peter gaped at her in astonishment, his muddled wits and
  aching head beginning dimly to realize that something was
  wrong.</p>

  <p>"Tom left here ... last night ... t'go home," he nodded
  emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Well, he never got home," snapped Julie. "And you'd best get
  your clothes on and help me find him. You were both as drunk as
  pigs, I suppose. If he's lying dead in a ditch it's you that'll
  have the blame."</p>

  <p>"Aw now, Julie!"</p>

  <p>"Don't Julie me, you fool! Get dressed and do something."</p>

  <p>"I'll come. You wait," and he went inside, and put his head
  into a basin of water, and threw on his clothes, and came out
  presently looking anxious and disturbed now that his sluggish
  brain had begun to work.</p>

  <p>"Where you been looking?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nowhere. I expected to find him here."</p>

  <p>"We had a glass or two and then he started off home. He could
  walk all right.... Did you.... You didn't see anything wrong ...
  anything ... at the Coup&eacute;e?" he asked, with a quick
  anxious look at her.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. What do you mean? Oh, mon Dieu!" and she
  started down the road at a run, with Peter lumbering after her
  and the neighbours in a buzzing tail behind.</p>

  <p>The cold douche had cooled Peter's hot head, the running
  quickened his blood and his thoughts, a sudden grim fear braced
  his brain to quite unusual activity.</p>

  <p>As he ran he recalled the events of the night before; their
  meeting with Gard and Nance; Tom's scurrilous insults.</p>

  <p>If Tom and Gard had met again&mdash;Gard would be sure to see
  Nance home. Had he met Tom on his way back? And if so&mdash;if
  so&mdash;and ill had come to Tom&mdash;why, Gard might get the
  blame. And&mdash;and&mdash;in short, though by zig-zag jerks as
  he ran&mdash;if Gard were out of the way for good and all,
  Nance's thoughts might turn to one nearer home. He would be sorry
  if ill had come to Tom, of course. But if Gard could be got rid
  of he would be most uncommonly glad.</p>

  <p>And as he panted after Julie, head down with the burden of
  much thinking, just before he reached the sunk way to the
  Coup&eacute;e, his eye lighted on something in the road that
  caused him to stop and bend&mdash;a button with a scrap of blue
  cloth attached. He picked it up hastily and put it in his pocket.
  On a white stone just by it there were some red-brown spots. He
  pushed it with his foot to the side of the road and was down into
  the cutting before the heavy-footed neighbours came up.</p>

  <p>Julie was ranging up and down the narrow pathway, searching
  the depths with a face like a hawk, hanging on to the rough sides
  of the pinnacles, and bending over in a way that elicited warning
  cries from the others as they came streaming down.</p>

  <p>But keenest search of the western slope revealed nothing amid
  its tangle of gorse and blackberry bushes, and the eastern cliff
  fell so sheer, and had so many projecting lumps and underfalls,
  that it was impossible to see close in to the foot.</p>

  <p>And then one, nimbler witted than the rest, climbed out along
  the common above the northern cliff, whereby, when he had come to
  the great slope, he took the Coup&eacute;e cliff in flank, and
  could spy along its base.</p>

  <p>And suddenly he stopped, and stiffened like a pointer sighting
  his bird, peered intently for a moment, and gave tongue.</p>

  <p>The chase was ended. That they had sought, and feared to find,
  was found.</p>

  <p>They came hurrying up, and clustered like cormorants on the
  slope, Julie among them, her face grim and livid in its black
  setting, her eyes blazing fiercely.</p>

  <p>The finder pointed it out. They all saw it&mdash;a huddled
  black heap close in under the cliff.</p>

  <p>Elevated by his discovery, the finder maintained his
  reputation by doing the only thing that could be done. He left
  them talking and sped away across the downs, across the fields,
  towards Creux harbour.</p>

  <p>He might, if he had known it, have found a boat nearer at
  hand, Rouge Terrier way or in Breni&egrave;re Bay. But he was a
  Sark man, and a farmer at that, and knew little and cared less,
  of the habits of Little Sark.</p>

  <p>And the rest, falling to his idea, streamed after him, for
  that which lay under the cliff could only be gotten out by
  boat.</p>

  <p>So to the Creux, panting the news as he went. And there,
  willing hands dragged a boat rasping down the shingle, and lusty
  arms, four men rowing and one astern sculling and steering at the
  same time, sent her bounding over the water as though it were
  life she sought, not death. For, though no man among them had any
  smallest hope of finding life in that which lay under the cliff,
  yet must they strain every muscle, till the labouring boat seemed
  to share their anxiety to get there and learn the worst.</p>

  <p>So, out past the L&acirc;ches, with the tide boiling round the
  point; past Derrible, with its yawning black mouths; past Dixcart
  with its patch of sand; under the grim bastions of the Cagnon;
  the clean grey cliffs and green downs above, all smiling in the
  morning sun; the clear green water creaming among the black
  boulders, hissing among their girdles of tawny sea-weeds,
  cascading merrily down their rifted sides; round the Convanche
  corner, so deftly close that the beauty of the water cave is
  bared to them, if they had eye or thought for anything but that
  which lies under the cliff in Coup&eacute;e Bay. And not a word
  said all the way&mdash;not one word. Jokes and laughter go with
  the boat as a rule, and high-pitched nasal patois talk; but
  here&mdash;not a word.</p>

  <p>The prow runs grating up the shingle, the heavy feet grind
  through it all in a line, for none of them has any desire to be
  first. Together they bend over that which had been Tom Hamon, and
  their faces are grim and hard as the rocks about them. Not that
  they are indifferent, but that any show of feeling would be
  looked upon as a sign of weakness.</p>

  <p>Under such circumstances men at times give vent to
  jocularities which sound coarse and shocking. But they are not
  meant so&mdash;simply the protest of the rough spirit at being
  thought capable of such unmanly weakness as feeling.</p>

  <p>But these men were elementally silent. One look had shown them
  there was nothing to be done but that which they had come to
  do&mdash;to carry what they had found back to the waiting crowd
  at the Creux.</p>

  <p>They had none of them cared much for this man. He was not a
  man to make close friends. But death had given him a new dignity
  among them, and the rough hands lifted him, and bore him to the
  boat as tenderly as though a jar or a stumble might add to his
  pains.</p>

  <p>And so, but with slower strokes now, as though that slight
  additional burden, that single passenger, weighed them to the
  water's edge, they crawl slowly back the way they came, logged,
  not with water, but with the presence of death.</p>

  <p>The narrow beach between the tawny headlands is black with
  people. Up above, on the edge of the cliff, another crowd peers
  curiously down.</p>

  <p>The S&eacute;n&eacute;chal is there at the water's edge,
  Philip Guille of La Ville, and the Greffier, William Robert, who
  is also the schoolmaster, and Thomas Le Masurier the
  Pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t, and Elie Guille the Constable, and Dr.
  Stradling from Dixcart, and the dark-faced, fierce-eyed woman who
  cannot keep still, but ranges to and fro in the lip of the tide,
  and whom they all know now as the wife&mdash;the Frenchwoman,
  though some of them have never seen her before.</p>

  <p>A buzz runs round as the boat comes slowly past the point of
  the L&acirc;ches. The woman stops her caged-beast walk and stands
  gazing fiercely at it, as if she would tear its secret out of it
  before it touched the shore.</p>

  <p>The watchers on the cliff have the advantage. Something like a
  thrill runs through them, something between a sigh and a groan
  breaks from them.</p>

  <p>The woman wades out to meet the boat. She sees and screams,
  and chokes. The wives on the beach groan in sympathy.</p>

  <p>The body is lifted carefully out and laid on the cool grey
  stones, and the woman stands looking at it as a tiger may look at
  her slaughtered mate.</p>

  <p>"Stand back! Stand back!" cries the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal to
  the thronging crowd; and to the Constable, "Keep them back, you,
  Elie Guille!" to which Elie Guille growls, "Par mad&eacute;, but
  that's not easy, see you!"</p>

  <p>The Doctor straightens up from his brief examination, and says
  a word to the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, and to the men about
  him.</p>

  <p>A rough stretcher is made out of a couple of oars and a sail,
  and the sombre procession passes through the gloomy old tunnel
  into the Creux Road, and wends its way up to the school-house for
  proper inquiry to be made as to how Tom Hamon came by his
  death.</p>

  <p>And close behind the stretcher walks the dark-faced woman,
  with her eyes like coals of fire, and her dress dragged open as
  though to stop her from choking.</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!" she says in
  perpetual iteration, through her clenched teeth. But to look at
  her face and eyes you might think it was rather the devil she was
  calling on.</p>

  <p>For, ungracious as their lives had been in many respects, yet
  this violent breaking of the yoke has left the survivor sore and
  wounded, and furious to vent her rage on whom at present she
  knows not.</p>

  <p>She is not allowed inside the school-house&mdash;hastily
  cleared of its usual occupants, who dodge about among the crowd
  outside, enjoying the unlooked-for holiday with gusto in spite of
  its gruesome origin&mdash;and so she prowls about outside, and
  the neighbours talk and she hears this, that, and the other, and
  presently, with bitter, black face and rage in her heart, she
  goes off home to find out Stephen Gard if she can, and accuse him
  to his face of the murder of her husband.</p>

  XVIII</h2>

  <h3>HOW PETER'S DIPLOMACY CAME TO NOUGHT</h3>

  <p>Peter Mauger had kept himself carefully beyond the range of
  Julie's wild black eyes. In the state she was in there was no
  knowing what she might do or say. And the words even of a mad
  woman sometimes stick like burrs. He began to breathe more freely
  when she whirled away home.</p>

  <p>The S&eacute;n&eacute;chal and Constable came out of the
  school-house at last with very grave faces.</p>

  <p>"The Doctor says his head was staved in with the blows of some
  round blunt thing like a mallet," said the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal
  to the gaping crowd, "and we must hold a proper inquiry. Any of
  you who saw Tom Hamon last night will be here at two o'clock to
  tell us all you know. Tell any others who know anything about it
  that they must be here too," and he went back into the
  school-house, and the buzzing crowd dispersed, with plenty to
  buzz about now in truth.</p>

  <p>Peter Mauger went thoughtfully home. He had had no breakfast,
  and was feeling the need of it, and he had something in his mind
  that he wanted to think out.</p>

  <p>And as he ate he thought, slowly and ruminatingly, and with
  many pauses, when his jaws stopped working to give his mind freer
  play, but still very much to the purpose, and as soon as he had
  done he set out to put his project into execution.</p>

  <p>Just beyond the Coup&eacute;e he met Gard hurrying towards
  Sark, and the state of Gard's nose and eye, and his torn coat,
  caught his eye at once.</p>

  <p>"What's this about Tom Hamon?" asked Gard hastily.</p>

  <p>"He's dead."</p>

  <p>"His wife has just told me so. But how did it happen?"</p>

  <p>"They're going to find out at school-house at two o'clock. Any
  that saw him last night are to be there. You'd better be
  there."</p>

  <p>"I'm going now."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Peter, and went on his way into Little
  Sark.</p>

  <p>His way took him to La Closerie. But he was not anxious to
  meet Mrs. Tom, so he hung about behind the hedges till Nance
  happened to come out of the house, and then he whistled softly
  and beckoned to her to come to him.</p>

  <p>Her face was very pale and troubled, and he saw she had been
  crying.</p>

  <p>"I want to speak to you," he said.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Come round here. It's important."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked wearily again, when she had joined him
  behind the green dyke.</p>

  <p>"It's this, Nance. You&mdash;you know I want you. I've always
  wanted you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;don't!" she cried, with protesting hand. "This is no
  time. Peter Mauger, for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a bit! Here's how it is. Doctor says Tom was killed by
  some one beating his head in with a hammer or something of the
  kind. Now who beat his head in? Who would be most likely to beat
  his head in? Not me, for we were mates. Some one that hated him.
  Some one that he was always quarrelling with&mdash;" Her face had
  grown so white that there was no colour even in the trembling
  lips. She stared at him with terrified eyes.</p>

  <p>"You know who I mean," he said. "If it wasn't him that did it
  I don't know who it was."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't," she jerked vehemently.</p>

  <p>"You'd wish so, of course. But&mdash;Look here!&mdash;I'm
  pretty sure they met again last night after&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, they met, and Tom tried to fight him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;then!"</p>

  <p>"And he's gone up at once, as soon as he heard that Tom was
  found, to tell them all about it."</p>

  <p>"Aw!"&mdash;decidedly crestfallen at the wind being taken out
  of his sails in this fashion. "I&mdash;I thought&mdash;maybe I
  could help him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh you did, did you?"&mdash;plucking up heart at sight of his
  discomfiture. "And how were you going to help him?"</p>

  <p>"If he's gone to make a clean breast of it it's all up, of
  course. If he'd kept it to himself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He might have run away, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Safest for him, maybe. Up above Coup&eacute;e there's a stone
  with blood on it. And I picked up this beside it," and he hauled
  out the button and the bit of blue cloth he had found. "I
  thought, maybe if he knew about these he might think it safest to
  go."</p>

  <p>"Then every one would have the right to say he'd done it, and
  he didn't. He knew no more about it than you did."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know anything about it."</p>

  <p>"Well, neither did he, and he's not the kind to run away."</p>

  <p>"Aw, well&mdash;I done my best. You'll remember that, Nance.
  You know what the Sark men are. He'd be safest away. You tell him
  I say so," and he pouched his discounted piece of evidence and
  turned and went, leaving Nance with a heavy heart.</p>

  <p>For, as Peter said, she knew what the Sark men were&mdash;a
  law unto themselves, and slow to move out of the deep-cut grooves
  of the past, but, once stirred to boiling point, capable of going
  to any lengths without consideration of consequences.</p>

  <p>And therein lay Gard's peril.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <h3>HOW THE SARK MEN FELT ABOUT IT</h3>

  <p>Every soul in the Island that could by any means get there,
  was in or outside the school-house, mostly outside, long before
  the clock struck two. Never in their lives had they hurried
  thither like that before.</p>

  <p>A barricade of forms had been made across the room. Within it,
  at the school-master's table, sat the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal,
  Philip Guille, and the Doctor, and old Mr. Cachemaille, the
  Vicar, ageing rapidly since the tragic death of his good friend,
  the late Seigneur; beside them stood the Pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t and
  the Greffier, behind them lay the body of Tom Hamon covered with
  a sheet.</p>

  <p>It was a perfect day, with a cloudless blue sky and blazing
  sun, and all the windows were opened wide. Those inside dripped
  with perspiration, but felt cold chills below their blue
  guernseys each time they looked at that stark figure with the
  upturned feet beneath the cold white sheet.</p>

  <p>Outside the barricade stood Elie Guille, the Constable, and
  his understudy Abraham Baker, the Vingt&eacute;nier, to keep
  order and call the witnesses.</p>

  <p>The Seigneur, Mr. Le Pelley, was away or he would undoubtedly
  have been there too. In his absence the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal
  conducted the proceedings.</p>

  <p>In the front row of school-desks, scored with the deep-cut
  initials of generations of Sark boys, sat the dead man's widow,
  tense and quivering, her eyes consuming fires in deep black
  wells, her face livid, her hands clenched still as though waiting
  for something to rend.</p>

  <p>More than one of the men who sat beside her at the desk found,
  with a grim smile, his own name looking up at him out of the
  maltreated board. And one nudged his neighbour and pointed to the
  name of Tom Hamon, cut deeper than any of the others and with the
  N upside down.</p>

  <p>Very briefly the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal stated that they were
  there to find out, if they could, how Tom Hamon came by his
  death, and added very gravely, in a deep silence, that after a
  most careful examination of the body the Doctor was of opinion
  that death had been caused, not by the fall from the
  Coup&eacute;e, which accounted for the dreadful bruises, but by
  violent blows on the head with a hammer or some sueh thing prior
  to the fall. They wanted to find out all about it.</p>

  <p>The Doctor stood up and confirmed what the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal had said, went somewhat more into detail
  to substantiate his opinion, and ended by saying, "The head, as
  it happens, is less bruised than any other part of the body,
  except on the crown, and that is practically beaten in, and not,
  I am prepared to swear, by a fall. These wounds were the
  immediate cause of death, and they were made before he fell down
  the rocks. Besides, he went down feet first. The abrasions on the
  legs and thighs prove that beyond a doubt. Then again, the base
  of the skull is not fractured, as it most certainly would have
  been if he had fallen on his head. Death was undoubtedly the
  result of those wounds in the head. It is impossible for me to
  say for certain with what kind of weapon they were made, but it
  was probably something round and blunt."</p>

  <p>"Now," said the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, when the Doctor had
  finished, and the hum and the growl which followed had died down
  again, "will any of you who know anything about this matter come
  forward and tell us all you know?"</p>

  <p>Stephen Gard stood up at once and all eyes settled on him.
  Then Peter Mauger was pushed along from the back, with friendly
  thumps and growling injunctions to speak up. But the looks
  bestowed on Gard were of quite a different quality from those
  given to Peter, and the men at the table could not but notice
  it.</p>

  <p>"We will take Peter Mauger first. Let him be sworn," said the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, and Gard sat down.</p>

  <p>The Greffier swore Peter in the old Island fashion&mdash;"Vous
  jurez par la foi que vous devez &agrave; Dieu que vous direz la
  v&eacute;rit&eacute;, et rien que la v&eacute;rit&eacute;, et
  tous ce que vous connaissez dans cette cause, et que Dieu vous
  soit en aide! (You swear by the faith which you owe to God that
  you will tell the truth, and only the truth, and all that you
  know concerning this case, and so help you God!)"</p>

  <p>Peter put up his right hand and swore so to do.</p>

  <p>"Now tell us all you know," said the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal.</p>

  <p>And Peter ramblingly told how he and Tom had been drinking
  together the night before, and how Tom had started off home and
  he had gone to bed.</p>

  <p>"Were you both drunk?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Very well, you were. Did you think it right to let your
  friend go off in that condition when he had to cross the
  Coup&eacute;e?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen him worse, many times, and no harm come to
  him."</p>

  <p>"Well, get on!"</p>

  <p>He told how Mrs. Tom woke him up in the morning, and how they
  had all gone in search of the missing man.</p>

  <p>"Was it you that found him?"</p>

  <p>"No, it was Charles Guille of Clos Bourel. But I found
  something too."</p>

  <p>"What was it?"</p>

  <p>"This"&mdash;and from under his coat he drew out carefully the
  white stone with its red-brown spots, and from his pocket the
  button and the scrap of blue cloth. And those at the back stood
  up, with much noise, to see.</p>

  <p>The men at the table looked at these scraps of possible
  evidence with interest, as they were placed before them.</p>

  <p>"Where did you find these things?"</p>

  <p>"Between Plaisance and the Coup&eacute;e."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of them?"</p>

  <p>"Seemed to me those red spots might be blood. The other's a
  button torn off some one's coat."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea whose blood and whose coat?"</p>

  <p>"The blood I don't know. The button, I believe, is off Mr.
  Gard's coat,"&mdash;at which another growl and hum went
  round.</p>

  <p>"And you know nothing more about the matter?"</p>

  <p>"That's all I know."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Sit down. Mr. Gard!" and Gard pushed his way among
  unyielding legs and shoulders, and stood before the grave-faced
  men at the table.</p>

  <p>They all knew him and had all come to esteem what they knew of
  him. They knew also of his difficulties with his men, and that
  there was a certain feeling against him in some quarters. Not one
  of them thought it likely he had done this dreadful thing.
  But&mdash;there was no knowing to what lengths even a decent man
  might go in anger. All their brows pinched a little at sight of
  his torn coat and missing button.</p>

  <p>He was duly sworn, and the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal bade him
  tell all he knew of the matter.</p>

  <p>"That button is mine," he said quietly, holding out the lapel
  of his coat for all to see. "If there is blood on that stone it
  is mine also"&mdash;at which a growling laugh of derision went
  round the spectators.</p>

  <p>Gard flushed at this unmistakable sign of hostility. The
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal threatened to turn them all out if
  anything of the kind happened again, and Gard proceeded to
  recount in minutest detail the happenings of the previous
  night&mdash;so far as they concerned himself and Tom Hamon.</p>

  <p>"What were you doing down at the Coup&eacute;e at that time of
  night?" asked the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal.</p>

  <p>"I had been having a smoke and was just about to turn in when
  I met Miss Hamon hurrying to the Doctor's for some medicine. I
  asked her permission to accompany her, and then took her home to
  Little Sark. It was when I was coming back that I met Tom
  Hamon."</p>

  <p>"Yes, little Nance came to me about half-past ten," said the
  Doctor, "I remember I asked her if she was not afraid to go all
  that way home alone, and she said she had a friend with her."</p>

  <p>"Was there any specially bad feeling between you and Tom
  Hamon?"</p>

  <p>"There had always been bad feeling, but any one who knows
  anything about it knows that it was not of my making."</p>

  <p>"Will you explain it to us?"</p>

  <p>"If you say I must. One does not like to say ill things of the
  dead."</p>

  <p>"We want to get to the bottom of this matter, Mr. Gard. Tell
  us all you know that will help us."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir, but I am sorry to have to go into that. It
  all began through Tom's bad treatment of his stepmother and
  step-sister and brother when I lived at La Closerie. I took sides
  with them and tried to bring him to better manners. We rarely met
  without his flinging some insult after me. They were generally in
  the patois, but I knew them to be insults by his manner and by
  the way they were greeted by those who did understand."</p>

  <p>"Had you met last night before you met near the
  Coup&eacute;e?"</p>

  <p>"We passed Tom by La Vauroque as we came from the Doctor's. He
  shouted something after us, but I did not understand it."</p>

  <p>"You don't know what it was that he said?" an unfortunate
  question on the part of the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, and quite
  unintentionally so on his part. It necessitated the introduction
  of matters Gard would fain have kept out of the enquiry.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, with visible reluctance, "I learned
  afterwards, and by accident, something of what he said or
  meant."</p>

  <p>"How was that, and what was it?"</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary to go into that? Won't it do if I say it was
  a very gross insult?"</p>

  <p>The three at the table conferred for a moment. Then the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal said very kindly, "I perceive we are
  getting on to somewhat delicate ground, Mr. Gard, but, for your
  own sake. I would suggest that no occasion should be given to any
  to say that you are hiding anything from the court."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir, I have nothing whatever to hide, and I have
  still less to be ashamed of. I found Miss Hamon was weeping
  bitterly at what her brother had said, and I tried to get her to
  tell me what it was, but she would not. I said I knew it was
  something against me, but I hoped by this time she had learned to
  know and trust me. I told her her sobs cut me to the heart and
  that I would give my life to save her from trouble. In a word, I
  told her I loved her, and in the excitement of the moment she
  dropped a word or two that gave me an inkling of what Tom had
  said. It was casting dirt at both her and myself. Then, as I came
  home, I met Tom as I have told you."</p>

  <p>The S&eacute;n&eacute;chal considered the matter for a moment.
  He did not for one moment believe that Gard had had any hand in
  the killing of Tom Hamon. But he could not but perceive the
  hostile feeling that was abroad, and his desire was, if possible,
  to allay it.</p>

  <p>"It is, I should think," he said gravely, "past any man's
  believing that, after asking Tom's sister to marry you, you
  should go straight away and kill Tom, even in the hottest of hot
  blood, though men at such times do not always know what they are
  doing. But you, from what I have seen and heard of you, are not
  such a man. I am going to ask you one question in the hope that
  your answer may have the effect of setting you right with all who
  hear it. Before God&mdash;had you any hand in the death of this
  man?&mdash;have you any further knowledge of the matter
  whatever?"</p>

  <p>"Before God," said Gard solemnly, his uplifted right hand as
  steady as a rock, "I had no hand in his death. I know nothing
  more whatever about the matter."</p>

  <p>"I believe you," said the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal.</p>

  <p>"And I," said the Doctor.</p>

  <p>"And I," said the Vicar gravely, and with much emotion.</p>

  <p>But from the spectators there rose a dissentient murmur which
  caused the Vicar to survey his unruly flock with mild amazement
  and disapproval&mdash;much as the shepherd might if his sheep had
  suddenly shed their fleeces and become wolves.</p>

  <p>And Julie Hamon sprang to her feet with blazing eyes, pointed
  a shaking hand at Gard, and screamed:</p>

  <p>"Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!"</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <h3>HOW SARK CRAVED BLOOD FOR BLOOD</h3>

  <p>Stephen Gard walked slowly down the road towards Plaisance in
  the lowest of spirits.</p>

  <p>This strange people amongst whom he had fallen, possessed, in
  pre-eminent degree, what in these later times is known as the
  defects of its qualities.</p>

  <p>Black sheep there were, of course, as there are in every
  community, who seemed all defects and possessed of no redeeming
  qualities whatever. But, taken as a whole, the men of Sark were
  simple, honest according to their lights, brave and hardy, very
  tenacious of their own ideas and their island rights, somewhat
  stubborn and easier to lead than to drive, and withal
  red-blooded, as the result of their ancestry, and given to a
  large despite of foreigners, in which category were included all
  unfortunates born outside the rugged walls of Sark.</p>

  <p>He had done his best among them, both for their own interests
  and those of the mines, but no striving would ever make him other
  than a foreigner; and in the depression of spirit consequent on
  the trying experiences of the day, he gloomily pondered the idea
  of giving up his post and finding a more congenial atmosphere
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Still, he was a Cornishman, and dour to beat. And, if he had
  incurred unreasonable dislike, he had also lighted on the virgin
  lode of Nance's love and trust, and that, he said to himself with
  a glow of gratitude, outweighed all else.</p>

  <p>He had left the school-house at once when he had given his
  evidence, and had heard no more of what had taken place there.
  The bystanders had let him pass without any open opposition, but
  their faces had been hard and unsympathetic, and he recognized
  that life among them would be anything but a sunny road for some
  time to come.</p>

  <p>If the people at Plaisance had told him to clear out and find
  another lodging he would not have been in the least surprised.
  But they had no such thought. In common with all who really got
  to know him, they had come to esteem and like him, and they had
  no reason to believe that he had had anything to do with Tom
  Hamon's death.</p>

  <p>He had pondered these matters wearily till bed-time, and he
  turned in at last sick of himself, and Sark, and things
  generally. But his brain would not sleep, and the longer he lay
  and the more he tossed and turned, the wearier he grew.</p>

  <p>Sleep seemed so impossible that he was half inclined to get up
  and dress and go out. The cool night air and the freshness of the
  dawn would be better than this sleepless unresting. Suddenly
  there came a sharp little tap on his window.</p>

  <p>A bird, he thought, or a bat.</p>

  <p>The tap came again&mdash;sharp and imperative.</p>

  <p>He got up quietly and went to the window. The night was still
  dark. As he peered into it a hand came up again and tapped once
  more and he opened the window.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gard!"&mdash;in a sharp whisper.</p>

  <p>"Nance! What is it, dear? Anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I want you&mdash;quick."</p>

  <p>"One minute!" and he hastily threw on his things and joined
  her outside.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Nance?" he asked anxiously, wondering what new
  complication had arisen.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you as we go. Come!" and they were speeding
  noiselessly down the road to the Coup&eacute;e.</p>

  <p>There she took his hand, as once before, to lead him safely
  across, and her hand, he perceived, was trembling violently.</p>

  <p>They were half way along the narrow path when the hollow way
  in front leading up into Little Sark resounded suddenly with the
  tramp of heavy feet.</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!" panted Nance, and he could feel her turn
  and look round like a hunted animal.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" she whispered. "Behind here! and oh, grip tight!" and
  she knelt and crawled on hands and knees round the base of the
  nearest pinnacle.</p>

  <p>In those days the pinnacles which buttress the Coup&eacute;e
  were considerably higher and bulkier than they are now, and along
  their rugged flanks the adventurous or sorely-pressed might find
  precarious footing. But it was a nerve-racking experience even in
  the day-time when the eye could guide the foot. Now, in the
  ebon-black night, it was past thinking of.</p>

  <p>Dazed by the suddenness and strangeness of the whole matter,
  and without an inkling of what it all meant, Gard clung like a
  fly to the bare rock and tried his hardest not to think of the
  sheer three hundred feet that lay between him and the black beach
  below.</p>

  <p>In grim and menacing silence, save for the crunch of their
  heavy feet on the crumbling pathway, the men went past, a dozen
  or more, as it seemed to Gard. When the sound of them had died in
  the hollow on the Sark side, Nance whispered, "Quick now!
  quick!"</p>

  <p>They crawled back into the roadway, and she took his hand in
  hers again which shook more than ever, and they sped away into
  Little Sark.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me, Nance. What is it all about?" he panted, as she
  nipped through an opening in a green bank and led the way towards
  the eastern cliffs over by the Pot.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;it's you they want," she gasped, and he stopped
  instantly and stood, as though he would turn and go back.</p>

  <p>"It is no use," she jerked emphatically, between breaths, and
  dragged impatiently at his arm. "You don't know our Sark men....
  They do things first and are sorry after.... Bernel heard them
  planning it all.... The men from Sark were to meet these ones,
  and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But," he said angrily, "running away looks like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no! Not here.... And it is only for a time. The truth
  will come out, but it would be too late if they had got you."</p>

  <p>"What would they have done with me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;terrible things. They are madmen when they are
  angry."</p>

  <p>He had yielded to her will, and they were speeding swiftly
  along the downs. The path was quite invisible to him. He tripped
  and stumbled at times on tangled roots of gorse and bracken, but
  she kept on swiftly and unerringly, as though the night were
  light about her.</p>

  <p>"Where are you taking me?" he asked, as they crept past the
  miners' cottages on the cliff above Rouge Terrier.</p>

  <p>"To Breni&egrave;re.... To L'Etat.... Bernel went on to find a
  boat."</p>

  <p>And presently they were out on the bald cliff-head, and
  slipping and sliding down it till they came to the ledge, below
  which Breni&egrave;re spreads out on the water like a giant's
  hand.</p>

  <p>Between her panting breaths Nance whistled a low soft note
  like the pipe of a sea-bird. A like sound came softly up from
  below, and slipping and stumbling again, they were on the beach
  among mighty boulders girt with dripping sea-weed.</p>

  <p>Another low pipe out of the darkness, and they had found the
  boat and tumbled into it, wet and bruised, and breathless.</p>

  <p>"Dieu merci!" said Bernel, and pulled lustily out to sea.</p>

  <p>The swirl of the tide caught them as they cleared
  Breni&egrave;re Point, and Gard crawled forward to take an oar.
  Nance did the same, and so set Bernel free to scull and steer,
  the arrangement which dire experience has taught the Sark men as
  best adapted to their rock-strewn waters and racing currents.</p>

  <p>Gard's mind was in a tumult of revolt, but he sensibly drove
  his feelings through his muscles to the blade of his oar, and
  said nothing. Nance and Bernel were not likely to have gone to
  these lengths without what seemed to them sufficient reason.</p>

  <p>And he remembered Nance's trembling arm on the Coup&eacute;e,
  and her agonies of fear on his account, and so came by degrees to
  a certain acceptance of their view of matters, and therewith a
  feeling of gratitude for their labours and risks on his behalf.
  For he did not doubt that, should the self-appointed
  administrators of justice learn who had baulked them of their
  prey, they would wreak upon them some of the vengeance they had
  intended for himself.</p>

  <p>He saw that it was no light matter these two had undertaken,
  and as he thought it over, and told the black welter under his
  oar what he thought of these wild and hot-headed Sark men, his
  gratitude grew.</p>

  <p>The thin orange sickle of a moon rose at last, high by reason
  of the mists banked thick along the horizon, and afforded them a
  welcome glimmer of light&mdash;barely a glimmer indeed, rather a
  mere thinning of the clinging darkness, but enough for Bernel's
  tutored eye.</p>

  <p>He took them in a cautious circuit outside the Quette d'Amont,
  the eastern sentinel of L'Etat, and so, with shipped oars, by
  means of his single scull astern, brought them deftly to the
  riven black ledges round the corner on the south side.</p>

  <p>It is a precarious landing at best, and the after scramble up
  the crumbling slope calls for caution even in the light of day.
  In that misleading darkness, clinging with his hands and climbing
  on the sides of his feet, and starting at startled feathered
  things that squawked and fluttered from under his groping hands
  and feet, Gard found it no easy matter to follow Nance, though
  she carried a great bundle and waited for him every now and
  again. When he looked down next day upon the way they had come he
  marvelled that they had ever reached the top in safety.</p>

  <p>"Wait here!" she said at last, when they had attained a
  somewhat level place, and before he had breath for a word she was
  away down again.</p>

  <p>She was back presently with another bundle, and he started
  when she thrust into his hands a long gun, and bade him pick up
  the first bundle and follow her. The feel of the gun brought home
  to him, as nothing else could have done, her and Bernel's views
  of possible contingencies.</p>

  <p>He followed her stumblingly along the rough crown of the
  ridge, till she dipped down a rather smoother slope and came to a
  stand before what seemed to him a heap of huge stones.</p>

  <p>"There is shelter in here," she said. "And these things are
  for your comfort. We will bring you more to eat in a day or
  two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nance, dear," he said, dropping the gun and the bundle, and
  laying his hand on her slim shoulder. "I have become a sore
  burden to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, no!" she said hastily. "You would have done as much
  for me, and it is because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For you, dear? I would give my life for you, Nance, and here
  it is you who are doing everything, and running all these risks
  for me."</p>

  <p>"It is because I know they are in the wrong. It may be only a
  day or two, and they will thank me when they find out their
  mistake."</p>

  <p>"Well, I thank you and Bernel with my whole heart. Please God
  I may some time be able to repay you!"</p>

  <p>"If you are safe, that is all we want. Now I must go. We must
  get back before they miss us."</p>

  <p>"God keep you, dear!" and he bent and kissed her, and as
  before she kissed him back with the frankness of a child.</p>

  <p>He was about to follow her when she turned to go, but she said
  imperatively, "Stop here, or you may lose yourself in the dark.
  And in the day-time do not walk on the ridge or they may see
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And the gun? What is that for?"</p>

  <p>"If they should come here after you, you will keep them off
  with it," she said, with a spurt of the true Island spirit. "It
  is your life they seek, and they are in the wrong. But no one
  ever comes here, and you will not need it. Now, good-bye! And God
  have you in His keeping!"</p>

  <p>"And you, dearest&mdash;and all yours!"&mdash;and she was gone
  like a flitting shadow.</p>

  <p>And while he still stood peering into the darkness into which
  she had merged, she suddenly materialized again and was by his
  side.</p>

  <p>"I forgot. Bernel told me to tell you it throws a little high.
  But I hope you won't need it. And there is fresh water among the
  rocks at the south end there."</p>

  <p>He caught her to him again, and kissed her ardently, and then
  she was gone.</p>

  <p>He strained his ears, fearful of hearing her slip or fall in
  the darkness, but she went without displacing a stone, and he was
  alone with the sickly moon, and the sombre sky, and the voices of
  the rising tide along the grim black ledges of his sanctuary.</p>

  <h3>HOW LOVE TOOK LOVE TO SANCTUARY</h3>

  <p>It all seemed monstrous strange to him, now that he had time
  to think of the actual fact apart from the difficulties of its
  accomplishment.</p>

  <p>An hour ago he was lying in his bed at Plaisance, in low
  enough spirits, indeed, at the outlook before him, but his
  gloomiest thought had never plumbed depths such as this.</p>

  <p>He wondered briefly if so extreme a step had been really
  necessary.</p>

  <p>And then he heard again the purposeful tramp of those heavy
  feet on the Coup&eacute;e, and fathomed again the menace of
  them.</p>

  <p>And he felt Nance's guiding hand trembling violently in his
  once more, and he said to himself that she and Bernel knew better
  than he how the land lay, and that he could not have done other
  than he had done.</p>

  <p>Then he became aware that the dew was drenching him, and so he
  bent and groped in the dark for the shelter Nance had spoken
  of.</p>

  <p>The strip of moon had paled as it rose, the huge white stones
  glimmered faintly in it, and a darker patch below showed him
  where the entrance must be. He crept into the darker patch on his
  hands and knees, bumping his head violently, but once inside
  found room to sit upright. Snaking out again, he laid hold of the
  two bundles and the gun, and dragged them into shelter.</p>

  <p>What the bundles contained he could not tell in the dark, but
  one felt like a thick woollen cloak, and the other like a
  blanket, and among their contents he felt a loaf of bread, and a
  bottle and a powder-flask. So he rolled himself up in the blanket
  and the cloak, and lay wondering at the strange case in which he
  found himself, and so at last fell asleep.</p>
  <hr style='width: 45%;' />

  <p>He woke into a dapple of light and shade which filled his
  wandering wits with wonder, till, with a start, he came to
  himself and remembered.</p>

  <p>The place he was in was something like a stone bee-hive, about
  eight feet across from side to side, with a rounded sloping roof
  rising at its highest some four feet from the ground, and the
  great blocks of which it was built fitted so ill in places that
  the sun shot the darkness through and through with innumerable
  little white arrows of light. The dark opening of the night was
  now a glowing invitation to the day. He shook off his wraps and
  crawled out into the open.</p>

  <p>And what an open!</p>

  <p>He drew deep breaths of delight at the magnificence of his
  outlook&mdash;its vastness, its spaciousness, its wholesome
  amplitude and loneliness. He felt like a new man born solitary
  into a new world.</p>

  <p>The sky, without a cloud, was like a mighty hollowed sapphire,
  in which blazed the clear white sun; and the vast plain of the
  sea, sweeping away into infinity, was a still deeper blue, with
  here and there long swathes of green, and here and there
  swift-speeding ruffles purple-black.</p>

  <p>A brisk easterly breeze set all the face of it a-ripple, and
  where the dancing wavelets caught the sun it glanced and gleamed
  like sheets of molten silver.</p>

  <p>"A silver sea! A silver sea!" he cried aloud, and into his
  mind there flashed an incongruous comparison of the bountifulness
  of Nature's silver with the pitiful grains they hacked out of her
  rocks with such toil and hardship.</p>

  <p>Away to the south across the silver sea the Jersey cliffs
  shone clear in the sunshine, and on the dimpling plain between,
  the black Paternosters looked so like the sails of boats heading
  for Sark that he remembered suddenly that he was in hiding, and
  dropped to cover alongside the great stones of his shelter.</p>

  <p>But careful observation of the square black objects showed him
  that they did not move, and anyway they were much too far away to
  see him. So he took courage again, and, full of curiosity
  concerning his hiding-place, he crept up the southern slope till
  he reached the ridge of the roof, so to speak, and lay there
  looking over, entranced with the beauty of the scene before
  him.</p>

  <p>The whole east coast of Sark right up to the Burons, off the
  Creux, lay basking in the morning light. Dixcart and Derrible
  held no secrets from him; he looked straight up their shining
  beaches. Their bold headlands were like giant-fists reaching out
  along the water towards him. Breni&egrave;re, the nearest point
  to his rock, was another mighty grasping hand, but between it and
  him swept a furious race of tossing, white-capped waves, with
  here and there black fangs of rock which stuck up through the
  green waters as though hungering for prey.</p>

  <p>He could just see the upper part of the miners' cottages on
  the cliff above Rouge Terrier, but, beyond these and the ruined
  mill on Hog's Back, not another sign of man and his toilsome,
  troublesome little works. But for these, Sark, in its utter
  loneliness, might have been a new-found island, and he its first
  discoverer.</p>

  <p>Ranging on, his eye rested on the shattered fragments of
  Little Sark, scattered broadcast over the sea about its most
  southerly point&mdash;bare black pinnacles, ragged ledges,
  islets, rocklets, reefs, and fangs, every one of which seemed to
  stir the placid sea to wildest wrath. Elsewhere it danced and
  dimpled in the sunshine, with only the long slow heave in it to
  tell of the sleeping giant below, but round each rock, and up the
  sides of his own huge pyramid, it swept in great green combers
  shot with bubbling white, and went tumbling back upon itself in
  rings of boiling foam.</p>

  <p>Beyond, he saw the rounded back of Jethou, and just behind it
  the long line of houses in Guernsey.</p>

  <p>He lay long enjoying it all, with the warm sun on his back,
  and the brisk wind toning his blood, but no view, however
  wonderful, will satisfy a man's stomach. He had fed the day
  before mostly on most unsatisfying emotions, and now he began to
  feel the need of something more solid. So he crept back along the
  slope to find out what there was for breakfast.</p>

  <p>His stores lay about the floor of his resting-place, just as
  he had turned them out in the night; a couple of long loaves, a
  good-sized piece of raw bacon, and another of boiled pork which
  he thought he recognized, some butter in a cloth, a bottle which
  looked as if it might contain spirits, the powder-flask, and a
  small linen bag containing bullets, snail-shot, and percussion
  caps. These, with Bernel's gun and the blanket, and the old
  woollen cloak, which he recognized as Mr. Hamon's roquelaure, and
  his pipe, and the tobacco he happened to have in his pouch,
  constituted, for the time being, his worldly possessions.</p>

  <p>He spread his cloak and blanket in the sun to dry and air,
  and, doubtful whether his rock would supply any further provision
  or when more might reach him from Sark, he proceeded to make a
  somewhat restricted meal of bread and cold pork.</p>

  <p>The raw bacon suggested something of a problem. To cook it he
  must have a fire. To have a fire he must have fuel; his
  tinder-box he always carried, of course, for the new matches had
  not yet penetrated to Sark. Moreover, to light a fire might be
  dangerous as liable to attract attention, unless he could do it
  under cover where no stray gleams could get out.</p>

  <p>He pondered these matters as he ate, spinning out his exiguous
  meal to its uttermost crumb to make it as satisfying as
  possible.</p>

  <p>He saw his way at once to perfecting his cover. All about him
  where he sat, the grey rock pushed through a thin friable soil
  like the bones of an ill-buried skeleton. And everywhere in the
  scanty soil grew thick little rounded cushions, half grass, half
  moss, varying in size from an apple to a foot-stool, which came
  out whole at a pluck or a kick. After breakfast he would plug up
  every hole in his shelter, and pile half-a-dozen sizeable pieces
  outside with which to close the front door. Then, if he could
  find anything in the shape of fuel, he saw his way to a dinner of
  fried bacon, but it would have to be after dark when the smoke
  would be invisible.</p>

  <p>But first he must find out about his water supply.</p>

  <p>Down at the south end, Nance had said. That must be over
  there, on that almost-detached stack of rocks, where the waves
  seemed to break loudest.</p>

  <p>So, after another crawl up to the ridge to make certain that
  no boats were about&mdash;for he had frequently seen them fishing
  in the neighbourhood of L'Etat&mdash;he crept down the flank of
  his pyramid almost to sea-level to get across to the outer
  pile.</p>

  <p>He had to pick his way with caution across a valley of black
  rocks, rifted and chasmed by the fury of the waves. He could
  imagine&mdash;or thought he could, but came far short of
  it&mdash;how the great green rollers would thunder through that
  black gully in the winter storms.</p>

  <p>There were great wells lined all round with rich brown
  sea-weeds, and narrow chasms in whose hidden depths the waters
  swooked and gurgled like unseen monsters, and whose broken edges,
  on which he had to step, were like the rough teeth of gigantic
  saws set up on end alongside one another.</p>

  <p>He crawled across these rough serrations and scaled the rifted
  black wall in front, and came at once on a number of shallow
  pools of rain-water lying in the hollows of a mighty slab.</p>

  <p>But the moment his head rose above the level of the steep
  black wall his ears were filled with a deafening roaring and
  rushing, supplemented by most tremendous dull thuddings which
  shook the stack like the blows of a mighty flail.</p>

  <p>From behind a further wall there rose a boiling mist, through
  which lashed up white jets of spray which slanted over the rocks
  beyond in a continuous torrent.</p>

  <p>He crawled to the further wall and looked over into a deep
  black gully, some fifteen feet wide and perhaps thirty feet deep,
  into which, out of a perfectly calm sea, most monstrous waves
  came roaring and leaping, till the whole chasm was foaming and
  spuming like an over-boiling milk-pan. In the middle of the
  chasm, for the further torment of the waters, was jammed a huge
  black rock, against which the incoming green avalanche dashed
  itself to fragments and went rocketing into the air. The solid
  granite at the further end was cleft from summit to base by a
  tiny rift a foot wide through which the boiling spume poured out
  to the sea beyond.</p>

  <p>But the marvel was where those gigantic waves came from. Save
  for the dancing wind-ripples and its long, slow internal
  pulsations, the sea was as smooth as a pond to within twenty
  yards of the rocks. Then it suddenly seemed to draw itself
  together, to draw itself down into itself indeed, like a tiger
  compressing its springs for a leap, and then, with a rush and a
  roar, it launched itself at the rocks with the weight of the
  ocean behind it, and hurtled blindly into the chasm where the
  black rock lay.</p>

  <p>It was a most wonderful sight, and Gard sat long watching it,
  then and later, fascinated always and puzzled by that
  extraordinary self-compression and sudden upleap of the waters
  out of an otherwise placid sea.</p>

  <p>It was but one more odd expression of Nature's fantastic
  humour, and the nearest he could come to an explanation of it was
  that, in the sea bed just there, was some great fault, some huge
  chasm into which the waters fell and then came leaping out to
  further torment on the rocks.</p>

  <p>It was as he was returning to his own quarters by a somewhat
  different route across the valley of rocks, that he lighted on
  another find which contented him greatly.</p>

  <p>In one of the saw-toothed chasms he saw a piece of wood
  sticking up, and climbed along to get it as first contribution to
  his fire. And when he got to it, down below in the gully, he
  found jammed the whole side of a boat, flung up there by some
  high spring tide and trapped before it could escape. Excellent
  wood for his firing, well tarred and fairly dry. He hauled and
  pulled till he had it all safely up, and then he carried it, load
  after load, to his house, and laid it out in the sun to dry still
  more.</p>

  <p>He worked hard all day, keeping a wary outlook for any stray
  fishermen.</p>

  <p>First he culled a great heap of the thin wiry grass which
  seemed the chief product of his rock, and spread it also to dry
  for a couch. There was no bracken for bedding, no gorse for
  firing. The grass would supply the place of the one, the broken
  boat the other.</p>

  <p>Then he made good all the holes in his walls and roof, except
  one in the latter for the escape of the smoke, and built a solid
  wall of the tufted cushions round the seaward side of his
  doorway, as a screen against his light being seen, and as a
  protection from the south-west wind if it should blow up strong
  in the night.</p>

  <p>He found it very strange to be toiling on these elemental
  matters, with never a soul to speak to. He felt like a castaway
  on a desert island, with the additional oddness of knowing
  himself to be within reach of his kind, yet debarred from any
  communication with them on pain, possibly, of death.</p>

  <p>At times he felt like a condemned criminal, yet knew that he
  had done no wrong, and that it was only the mistaken justice of a
  simple people that wanted blood for blood, and was not
  over-heedful as to whose blood so long as its own sense of
  justice was satisfied.</p>

  <p>But, he kept saying to himself, things might have been worse
  with him, very much worse, but for Nance and Bernel. And before
  long, any day, the matter might be cleared up and himself
  reinstated in the opinion of the Sark men.</p>

  <p>Even that would leave much to be desired, but possibly, he
  thought, if they found they had sorely misjudged him in this
  matter, they might realize that they had done so in other matters
  also, and that he had only been striving to do his duty as he saw
  it.</p>

  <p>And then, wherever else his thoughts led him, there was always
  Nance, and the thought of Nance always set his heart aglow and
  braced him to patient endurance and hope.</p>

  <p>He retraced, again and again, all the ways they had travelled
  together in these later days, recalled her every word and look,
  felt again the trembling of her hand&mdash;for him&mdash;on the
  Coup&eacute;e, heard again the tremors of her voice as she urged
  him to safety. And those sweet ingenuous kisses she had given
  him! Yes, indeed, he had much to be grateful for, if some things
  to cavil at, in fortune's dealings.</p>

  <p>But, behind all his fair white thought of Nance, was always
  the black background of the whole circumstances of the case, and
  the grim fact of Tom Hamon's death, and he pondered this last
  with knitted brows from every point of view, and strove in vain
  for a gleam of light on the darkness.</p>

  <p>Could the Doctor be mistaken, and was Tom's death the simple
  result of his fall over the Coup&eacute;e? The Doctor's
  pronouncement, however, seemed to leave no loophole of hope
  there.</p>

  <p>If not, then who had killed Tom, and why?</p>

  <p>He could think of no one. He could imagine no reason for
  it.</p>

  <p>Tom had been a bully at home, but outside he was on jovial
  terms with his fellows&mdash;except only himself. He had to
  acknowledge to himself the seeming justice of the popular
  feeling. If any man in Sark might, with some show of reason, have
  been suspected of the killing of Tom Hamon, it was himself.</p>

  <p>Once, by reason of overmuch groping in the dark, an awful
  doubt came upon him&mdash;was it possible that, in some horrible
  wandering of the mind, of which he remembered nothing, he had
  actually done this thing? Done it unconsciously, in some
  over-boiling of hot blood into the brain, which in its explosion
  had blotted out every memory of what had passed?</p>

  <p>It was a hideous idea, born of over-strain and overmuch
  groping after non-existent threads in a blind alley.</p>

  <p>He tried to get outside himself, and follow Stephen Gard that
  night and see if that terrible thing could have been possible to
  him.</p>

  <p>But he followed himself from point to point, and from moment
  to moment, and accounted for himself to himself without any lapse
  whatever; unless, indeed, his brain had played him false and he
  had gone out of the house again after going into it, and followed
  Tom and struck him down.</p>

  <p>With what? The Doctor said with some blunt instrument like a
  hammer. Where could he have obtained it? What had he done with
  it?</p>

  <p>The idea, while it lasted, was horrible. But he shook it off
  at last and called himself a fool for his pains. He had never
  harboured thought of murder in his life. He had detested Tom, but
  he had never gone the length of wishing him dead. The whole idea
  was absurd.</p>

  <p>All these things he thought over as, his first essential
  labours completed, he lay under the screen of the ridge and
  watched the sun dropping towards Guernsey in a miracle of
  eventide glories.</p>

  <p>Below him, the long slow seas rocketted along the ragged black
  base of his rock with mighty roarings and tumultuous bursts of
  foam, and on the ledges the gulls and cormorants squabbled and
  shrieked, and took long circling flights without fluttering a
  wing, to show what gulls could do, or skimmed darkly just above
  the waves and into them, to show that cormorants were never
  satisfied. And now and again wild flights of red-billed puffins
  swept up from the water and settled out of his sight at the
  eastern end of the rock, and he promised himself to look them up
  some other day if opportunity offered.</p>

  <p>From the constant tumult of the seas about his rock, except
  just at low water, he saw little fear of being taken by surprise,
  even if his presence there became known. Twice only in the
  twenty-four hours did it seem possible for any one to effect a
  landing there, and at those times he promised himself to be on
  the alert.</p>

  <p>He lay there till the sun had gone, and the pale green and
  amber, and the crimson and gold of his going had slowly passed
  from sea and sky, and left them grey and cold; till a single
  light shone out on Sark, which he knew must be in one of the
  miners' cottages, and many lights twinkled in Guernsey; till
  beneath him he could no longer see the sea, but only the white
  foam fury as it boiled along the rocks. Then he crept away to his
  burrow, rejoicing in the thought of the companionship of a fire
  and hot food.</p>

  <h3>HOW THE STARS SANG OF HOPE</h3>

  <p>It took Gard some time to get his fire started, and when it
  did blaze up, with fine spurts of gas from the tar, and vivid
  blue and green and red flames from the salted wood, the little
  stone bee-hive glowed like an oven and presently grew as hot as
  one. The smoke escaped but slowly through the single hole in the
  roof, and at last he could stand it no longer, and crept out into
  the night until his fire should have burned down to a core of red
  ashes over which he could grill his dinner.</p>

  <p>And what a night! He had seen the stars from many parts of the
  earth and sea, but never, it seemed to him, had he seen such
  stars as these, so close, so large, so wonderfully clean and
  bright. And, indeed, glory of the heavens so supreme as that is
  possible only far away from man, and all the works and
  habitations of man, and all his feeble efforts at the mitigation
  of the darkness. Nay, for fullest perception, it may be that it
  is necessary for a man to be not only alone in the profundity of
  Nature's night, but to be lifted somewhat out of himself and his
  natural darkness by extremity of joy, or still more of need.</p>

  <p>The milky way was as white as though a mighty brush dipped in
  glittering star-dust had been drawn across the velvet dome. The
  larger stars, many of which were old acquaintances and known to
  him by name, seemed to swing so clear and close that they took on
  quite a new aspect of friendliness and cheer. The smaller&mdash;I
  write as he thought&mdash;a mighty host, an innumerable company
  quite beyond his ken, still spoke to him in a language that he
  had never forgotten.</p>

  <p>Long ago, when he was quite a little boy, he had come upon a
  great globe of the heavens, a much-prized curiosity of his old
  schoolmaster. Upon it appeared all the principal stars linked up
  into their constellations, the shadowy linking lines forming the
  figures of the Imaginary Ones associated with them in the minds
  of the ancients. There, on the varnished round of the globe,
  ranged the Great and Little Bears, and the Dogs, and the Archer,
  and the Flying Horse, the Lion, and the Crab, and the Whale, and
  the Twins, and Perseus and Andromeda, and Cassiopeia. And up
  there, on the dark inner side of the mighty dome, he seemed to
  see them all again, and time swung back with him for a moment,
  and he was a boy once more.</p>

  <p>And, gazing up at them all, their steady shine and
  many-coloured twinklings led him to wonder as to the how and the
  why of them. From the stars to their Maker was but a natural
  step, and so he came, simply and naturally, to thought of the
  greatness of Him who swung these innumerable worlds in their
  courses, and, from that, to His goodness and justice.</p>

  <p>Memories of his mother came surging back upon him, and of all
  her goodness and all she had taught him. She had had a mighty,
  simple trust in the goodness of God, and had passed it on to her
  boy, though his rough contact with the world had overworn it all
  to some extent.</p>

  <p>Still, it was all there, and now it all came back to him
  through the hopeful twinkling eyes of those innumerable
  stars.</p>

  <p>"Have courage and hope!" they sang; and though all his little
  world, save those two or three who knew him best, was against
  him, he stood there with his face turned up to the stars, and
  believed in his heart that all would yet be well.</p>

  <p>And when at last he turned back to things of earth, he found
  the stars still twinkling in the sea, as though they would not
  let him go even though he gave up looking at them. They gleamed
  and glanced in the smooth-rolling waves till the deep seemed sown
  with phosphorescence, as on that night in Grand Gr&egrave;ve; the
  night Nance came upon him so suddenly in the dark and he went on
  with her to get Grannie's medicine.</p>

  <p>Was it possible that that blessed night, that terrible night,
  was barely forty-eight hours old? So much had happened since
  then, such incredible things! It seemed weeks ago. It seemed like
  a dream; horrid, fantastic, wonderfully sweet.</p>

  <p>Within that tiny span of hours he had come to the knowledge of
  Nance's love for him. Oh those sweet, frank kisses! If he had
  died last night; if the hot heads in their madness had killed him
  to balance Tom Hamon's account&mdash;still he would have lived:
  for Nance had kissed him.</p>

  <p>And within the half of that short span he had been judged a
  murderer, had had to flee for his life, and would, without a
  doubt, have lost it but for Nance.</p>

  <p>She had undertaken a mighty risk for him&mdash;for him! And
  she had shown him that she loved him, for she had kissed him with
  her heart in her lips.</p>

  <p>And, grateful as he was for all the rest, it was still the
  recollection of those sweet kisses that he thought of most.</p>

  <p>So "Hope! Hope!" sang the stars, and his heart was high
  because his conscience was clean and Nance had kissed him.</p>

  <p>When at last he crawled into his burrow, his fire was only
  white ashes, and he would not trouble to relight it.</p>

  <p>He broke off a piece of bread, and ate it slowly, and thought
  of Nance, and promised himself the larger breakfast. Then he
  rolled himself in his cloak, and slept more soundly than an
  alderman after a civic feast.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER
  XXIII</h2>

  <h3>HOW NANCE SENT FOOD AND HOPE TO HIM</h3>

  <p>Next morning, when he crawled out of his burrow, Gard found
  everything swathed in dense white mist. Upon which he promptly
  lit his fire, and in due course enjoyed a more satisfying meal
  than he had eaten since he landed on the rock.</p>

  <p>Then he decided to take advantage of the screening mist to
  explore such parts of his prison-house as were not available to
  him at other times. So he walked along the ridge, secure from
  observation since he could not himself see down to the water from
  it, though the rushings and roarings along the black ledges below
  never ceased.</p>

  <p>Every nook and ledge of the out-cropping rock on the south
  side of the ridge was occupied by lady gulls in all stages of
  their maternal duties. From the surprise they expressed at his
  intrusion, and the way they stuck to their nests, they were
  evidently quite unused to man and his ways, and it was all he
  could do to avoid stepping on them and their squawking families
  as he picked his way along.</p>

  <p>He clambered down the eastern slope nearest Sark, and found
  the ground there covered with a fairly deep soil, and green
  growths that were strange to him. The soil was perforated with
  holes which at first he ascribed to rabbits, but when he inserted
  his hand into one he got such a nip from an unusually strong beak
  that he changed his mind to puffins, and, standing quite still
  for a time, he presently saw the members of the colony come
  creeping out behind their great red bills and scurry off across
  the water in search of breakfast.</p>

  <p>Then the great semi-detached pinnacle below attracted him, and
  he scrambled down amid the complaints of a great colony of gulls
  and cormorants but found the tide still too full for him to cross
  the intervening chasm. Those wonderful great green waves out of a
  smooth sea came roaring along the sides of the island and met
  full tilt in the chasm below him, as they leaped exultant from
  their conflict with the rocks. They hurled themselves against one
  another in wildest fury, and the foam of their meeting boiled
  white along the ledges, and dappled all the sea.</p>

  <p>As he crawled through the lank wet grass and soft spongy soil,
  he found himself suddenly confronted with a great barrier of
  fallen rocks; as though, at some period of its existence, the
  north end of the island had tapered to a gigantic peak which, in
  the fulness of its time, had come down with a crash, and now lay
  like a titanic wall from summit to sea-board. Huge and
  forbidding, of all shapes and sizes, the mighty fragments barred
  his course like a menace, and he attacked them warily, drawing
  himself with infinite caution from one to another; over this one,
  under this, deftly between these two, lest an unwary weighting
  should start them on the movement that might grind him to
  powder.</p>

  <p>The fog increased their forbidding aspect tenfold. He could
  not see a foot before him, and could only worm his way among
  them, testing each before he trusted it, and finding at times
  monsters become but mediocre when his hand was on them. More than
  once he had to rest his hands on cautiously-tried ledges and
  swing his legs forward and grope with his feet for foothold, and
  whether the space below was trifling, or whether it ran to
  incredible depth, he could not tell.</p>

  <p>It was a mighty relief to him to come out at last on the other
  side of the wall, and to find himself on the great north slope
  which faced Sark, and so was closed to him in clear weather.</p>

  <p>The long thin grass grew rankly here, and was beaded with
  moisture, but he pushed along with an eerie feeling at the
  wildness of it all.</p>

  <p>The mist clung close about him, but had suddenly become
  luminous. He felt as though he were packed loosely all round with
  cotton wool on which a strong light was shining. It gave him a
  feeling of light-headedness. Everything was light about him, and
  yet he could not see more than a couple of feet before his face.
  The waves roared hoarsely below him, and once he had unknowingly
  got so low down that a monstrous white arm, reaching suddenly up
  out of the depths, seemed about to lay hold on him and drag him
  back with it into the turmoil.</p>

  <p>He was panting and full of mist when at last he climbed the
  second great rock barrier and rounded the corner towards the
  south.</p>

  <p>And as he sat resting there, the whiff of a westerly breeze
  tore a long lane in the white shroud, and for a moment he saw, as
  through a telescope, the houses of Guernsey gleaming in bright
  sunshine. Then it closed again, and presently began to drift past
  him in strange whorls and spirals, like hurrying ghosts wrapped
  hastily in filmy garments, which loosed at times and trailed
  slowly over the rocks and caught and clung to their sharp
  projections. Then the sun completed the rout, and the mist-ghosts
  swept away towards France, harried by the west wind like a flock
  of sheep before the shepherd's dog.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon the heat grew so intense that he was driven
  to the wells in the valley of rocks for a bathe, for there was no
  shelter available, and his bee-hive was like an oven.</p>

  <p>None of the pools was large enough for a swim, and it was more
  than a man's life was worth to venture among the boiling surges
  of the outer rocks. But he could at all events get under water,
  if it was only to sit there and cool off.</p>

  <p>So he stripped, and was just about slipping into a deep still
  bath, emerald green, with a fringe of amber weeds all round its
  almost perpendicular sides, when, glancing down to make sure of
  an ultimate footing, his eye lighted with a shock of surprise on
  a pair of huge eyes looking straight up at him out of the water.
  They were violet in colour, protuberant, and malevolent beyond
  words.</p>

  <p>He sat down suddenly on the baking black rock, with a cold
  shiver running down his back in spite of the scorch of the sun.
  The utter cold malignity of those great violet eyes, and the
  thought of what would have happened if he had stepped into that
  pool, made him momentarily sick.</p>

  <p>He had seen small devil-fish in the pools in Sark, but never
  one approaching this in size. He crept away at last, leaving it
  in possession, and found a pool clear of boulders or caving
  hollows, and sat in it with no great enjoyment, wondering if the
  great unwholesome beast in the other would be likely to climb the
  cliff and come upon him in the night. He thought it unlikely, but
  still the idea clung to him and caused him no little discomfort.
  He blocked his door that night with great green cushions, though
  he felt doubtful if they would be effective against the wiles and
  strength of a devil-fish, if half that he had heard of them was
  true.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the night&mdash;for he went to bed early,
  having nothing else to do, except to watch the stars&mdash;he
  woke with a cold start, feeling certain that hideous creature had
  crawled up the slope and was feeling all round his house for an
  entrance.</p>

  <p>Certainly <i>something</i> was moving about outside, and feeling
  over the stones in an uncertain, searching kind of a way. And
  when you have been wakened up from a nightmare in which staring
  devil-eyes played a prominent part, <i>something</i> may be anything,
  and as like as not the owner of the eyes.</p>

  <p>But even devil-fishes in their most advanced stages have not
  yet attained the power of human speech. If they speak to one
  another what a horrible sound it must be!</p>

  <p>It was with a sigh of relief, and a sudden unstringing of the
  bow, that he heard outside&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gard!" and with a lusty kick, which expressed some of his
  feeling, he sent his doorway flying and crawled out after it.</p>

  <p>The myriad winking stars lifted the roof of the world and the
  darkness somewhat, sufficient at all events for him to make out
  that it was not Nance.</p>

  <p>"You, Bernel?" he queried, as the only possible
  alternative.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Gard. I've brought you some more things to eat."</p>

  <p>"Good lad! I'm a great trouble to you. Where is Nance? In the
  boat?"</p>

  <p>"No, she couldn't come. That Julie's watching her like a cat.
  It was she and Peter stirred up the men against you. All day
  yesterday the whole Island was out looking for you, dead or
  alive, and very much puzzled as to what had become of you. And
  Julie's got a suspicion that we know. They searched the house for
  you in spite of mother and Grannie, but they won't forget Grannie
  in a hurry, and I don't think they'll come back," and he laughed
  at the recollection of it.</p>

  <p>"What did Grannie do?"</p>

  <p>"She just looked at them from under that big black sun-bonnet,
  and muttered things no one heard. But her eyes were like points
  of burning sticks, and they all crept out one after another,
  afraid of they didn't know what. But Julie's been on the watch
  all day, and would hardly let us out of her sight. But she
  couldn't watch us both when we were not together. So Nance got a
  bundle of things ready for you, and then went out with another
  bundle and Julie followed her, and I slipped off here."</p>

  <p>"Bernel, I don't know how to thank you all! What should I have
  done without you?"</p>

  <p>"You'd have been dead, most likely. It's not that they cared
  much for Tom, you know, but they don't like the idea of a Sark
  man being killed by a foreigner and no one paying for it."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not a foreigner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes you are, to them. Of course you're not a Frenchman, but
  all the same you're not a Sark man. Good thing for you you'd
  lived with us and we'd got to know you and like you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was a good thing indeed. I'm only sorry to have
  brought you trouble and to be such a trouble to you."</p>

  <p>"If we thought you'd done it of course we wouldn't trouble.
  But we know you couldn't have."</p>

  <p>"Nothing fresh has turned up?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing yet. But Nance says it will, sure. Truth must out,
  she says."</p>

  <p>"It's a weary while of coming out sometimes, Bernel. And I
  can't spend the rest of my life here, you know."</p>

  <p>"She said you were to keep your heart up. You never know what
  may happen."</p>

  <p>"Tell her I can stand it because of all her goodness to me. If
  I hadn't her to think of I might go mad in time."</p>

  <p>"I've brought you a rabbit I snared. Nance cooked it."</p>

  <p>"That was good of her. Can you eat puffins' eggs?"</p>

  <p>"They want a bit of getting used to," laughed the boy. "But
  they're better cooked than raw."</p>

  <p>"I can cook them. I found part of an old boat, and I've
  plugged up all the holes in the shelter, and I only light a fire
  at night. Could I fish here?"</p>

  <p>"Too big a sea close in. I've got some in the boat. I put out
  a line as I came across. I'll leave you some."</p>

  <p>"And have you a bottle&mdash;or a bailing-tin? Anything I
  could bring home some water from the pools in? I have to go over
  there every time I need a drink, and in the dark it's not
  possible."</p>

  <p>"You can have the bailer. It's a new one and sound."</p>

  <p>"Now tell me, Bernel, if they find out I'm here what will they
  do?"</p>

  <p>"They might come across and try and take you, unless they cool
  down; and that won't be so long as that Julie and Peter talk as
  they do. She makes him do everything she tells him. He's a
  sheep."</p>

  <p>"And if they come across, what do you and Nance expect me to
  do?"</p>

  <p>"You've got my gun," said the boy simply.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've got your gun. But do you expect me to kill some of
  them?"</p>

  <p>"They'd kill you," said Bernel, conclusively. On second
  thoughts, however, he added, "But you needn't kill them. Wing one
  or two, and the rest will let you be. With a gun I could keep all
  Sark from landing on L'Etat."</p>

  <p>"Suppose they come in the night? How many landing-places are
  there?"</p>

  <p>"There's another at the end nighest Guernsey, but it's not
  easy. And it's only low tide and half-ebb that lets you ashore
  here at all."</p>

  <p>"How about your boat?"</p>

  <p>"She's riding to a line. Tide's running up that way, but I'd
  better be off."</p>

  <p>They stumbled through the darkness and the sleeping gulls,
  which woke in fright, and volubly accused one another of
  nightmares and riotous behaviour&mdash;and Bernel hauled in his
  boat, and handed Gard the tin dipper and three good-sized
  bream.</p>

  <p>"If you can't eat them all at once, split them open and dry
  them in the sun," he said. "They'll keep for a week that
  way."</p>

  <p>"Tell Nance I think of her every hour of the day, and I pray
  God the truth may come out soon."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell her. It'll come out. She says so," and he pulled
  out into the darkness and was gone.</p>

  <p>And the Solitary went back to his shelter, secure in the
  knowledge that the tide was on the rise, and half-ebb would not
  be till well on into next day. And he thought of Nance, and of
  Bernel, and of all the whole matter again; white thoughts and
  black thoughts, but chiefly white because of Nance, and Nance was
  a fact, while the black thoughts were shadows confusing as the
  mist.</p>

  <p>He could only devoutly hope and pray that a clean wind might
  come and put the shadows to flight and let the sun of truth shine
  through.</p>

  XXIV</h2>

  <h3>HOW HE SAW STRANGE SIGHTS</h3>

  <p>Living thus face to face with Nature, and drawn through lack
  of other occupation into unusually intimate association with her,
  Gard found his lonely rock a centre of strange and novel
  experience.</p>

  <p>Situated as he was, even small things forced themselves
  largely upon his observation and wrought themselves into his
  memory. He found it good to lose himself for a time in these
  visible and tangible actualities, rather than in useless efforts
  after an understanding of the mystery of which he was the victim
  and centre.</p>

  <p>He had given over much time to pondering the subject of Tom
  Hamon's death, but had come no nearer any reasonable solution of
  it. That hideous doubt as to himself in the matter recurred at
  times, but he always hastened to dissipate it by some other
  interest more practical and palpable, lest it should bring him to
  ultimate belief in its possibility, and so to madness.</p>

  <p>And so he spent hours watching that wonderful roaring cauldron
  on the south stack where his water pools were. Other hours in
  study of the social and domestic economies of gulls and
  cormorants. He saw families of awkward little fawn-coloured
  squawkers force their way out of their shells under his very
  eves, while indignant mothers told him what they thought of him
  from a safe distance.</p>

  <p>He bathed regularly in the heat of the day, but always after
  careful inspection of his chosen pool, and one day fled in haste
  up the black rocks at sight of the tip of a long, quivering,
  flesh-coloured tentacle coming curling round a rock in the close
  neighbourhood of the pool in which he was basking.</p>

  <p>That monster under the rock gave him many a bad dream. It
  seemed to him the incarnation of evil, and those horrible,
  bulging, merciless eyes stuck like burrs in his memory.</p>

  <p>One day, when he had been watching the cauldron, and filling
  his tin dipper at the freshwater pools, as he came to descend the
  black wall leading to the valley of rocks, he witnessed a little
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>Down below, on the edge of the pool where the octopus dwelt, a
  silly young cormorant was standing gazing into the water, so
  fascinated with something it saw there that it forgot even to
  jerk its head in search of understanding.</p>

  <p>Gard stood and watched. He saw a tiny pale worm-like thing
  come creeping up the black rock on which the cormorant squatted.
  The cormorant saw it too, and he was hungry, as all cormorants
  always are, even after a full meal. So presently he made a jab at
  it with his curved beak, and in a moment the pale worm had
  twisted itself tightly round his silly neck, and dragged him
  screaming and fluttering under the water.</p>

  <p>Another day, when he was coming down by the break in the
  cliff, where some great winter wave had bitten out such a slice
  that the top had come tumbling down, he saw the monster sunning
  itself on the flat rock by the side of its pool, like a huge
  nightmare spider.</p>

  <p>The moment he appeared its great eyes settled on his as though
  it had been waiting only for him. And when he stopped, with a
  feeling of shuddering discomfort at its hugeness&mdash;for its
  body seemed considerably over a foot in width, while its arms
  lounging over the rocks were each at least six feet long, and
  looked horribly muscular&mdash;he could have sworn that one of
  the great devil-eyes winked familiarly at him, as though the
  beast would say, "Come on, come on! Nice day for a bathe! Just
  waiting for you!"</p>

  <p>He could see the loathsome body move as it breathed, swinging
  comfortably in the support of its arms.</p>

  <p>In a fury of repulsion he stooped to pick up a rock, but when
  he hurled it the last tentacle was just sliding into the pool,
  and it seemed to him that it waved an ironical farewell before it
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>More than once fishing-boats hovered about his rock, but kept
  a safe distance from the boiling underfalls, and he always lay in
  hiding till they had gone.</p>

  <p>But he saw more gracious and beautiful things than these.</p>

  <p>As he lay one morning, looking over the ridge at the Sark
  headlands shining in the sun&mdash;with a strong west wind
  driving the waves so briskly that, Sark-like, they tossed their
  white crests into the air in angry expostulation long before they
  met the rocks, and went roaring up them in dazzling spouts of
  foam&mdash;his eye lighted on a gleam of unusual colour on the
  racing green plain. It came again and again, and presently, as
  the merry dance waxed wilder still, every white-cap as it tossed
  into the air became a tiny rainbow, and the whole green plain was
  alive with magical flutterings, of colours so dazzling that it
  seemed bestrewn with dancing diamonds. A sight so wonderful that
  he found himself holding in his! breath lest a puff should drive
  it all away.</p>

  <p>That same evening, too, was a glory of colour such as he had
  never dreamed of. The setting sun was ruby; red, and the
  cloud-bank into which he sank was all rimmed with red fire that
  seemed to corruscate in its burning brilliancy.</p>

  <p>To Gard indeed, in the somewhat peculiar state of mind induced
  by his sudden cutting-off from his kind and flinging back upon
  himself, it seemed as though the blood-red sun had fallen into a
  vast consuming fire behind that dark, fire-rimmed cloud, and that
  that was the end of it, and it would never rise again.</p>

  <p>The sky, right away into the farthest east, was flaming red
  with a hint of underlying smoke below the glow. The sea was a
  weltering bath of blood, and the cliffs of Sark, save for the
  gleam of white foam at their feet, shone as red as though they
  had just been bodily dipped in it.</p>

  <p>His lonely rock, when he looked round at it in wonder, was all
  unfamiliarly red. There was a red fantastic glow in the very air,
  and he himself was as red as though he had in very fact killed
  Tom Hamon, and drenched himself with his blood.</p>

  <p>So startling and unnatural was it all, that he found himself
  wondering fearfully if these outside things were really all
  blood-red, or whether something had gone wrong with his brain and
  eyes, and only caused them to look so to him alone, or whether it
  was indeed the end of all things shaping itself slowly under his
  very eyes. And in that thought and fear he was not by any means
  alone.</p>

  <p>But the wonderful red, which in its universality and intensity
  had become overpowering and fearsome, faded at last, and he
  hailed its going with a sigh of relief. His eyes and his brain
  were all right, he had not killed Tom Hamon, and this was not the
  earth's last sunset.</p>

  <p>And again that night, as he sat on the ridge on sentinel duty
  till the rising tide should lock the doors of his castle, the sea
  all round him shone with phosphorescence; every breaking wave
  along the black plain was a lambent gleam of lightning, and where
  they tore up the sides of his rock they were like flames out of a
  fiery sea, so that he sat there looking down upon a weltering
  band of nickering green and blue fires, which clung to the black
  ledges and dripped slowly back into the seething gleam below.</p>

  <p>It was all very strange and very awesome, and he wondered what
  it might portend in the way of further marvels.</p>

  <p>And he had not long to wait.</p>

  <p>Far away in the Atlantic a cyclone had been raging, and
  carrying havoc in its skirts. Now it was whirling towards Europe,
  and the puffins crept deep into their holes, and the gulls
  circled with disconsolate cries, and the cormorants crouched
  gloomily in lee of their snuggest ledges, and all nature seemed
  waiting for the blow.</p>

  <p>Gard was awakened in the morning by the gale tearing at the
  massive stones of his shelter as though it would carry them
  bodily into the sea.</p>

  <p>And when he crawled out, flat like a worm, the wind caught him
  even so, and he had to grimp to earth and anchor himself by
  projecting pieces of rock.</p>

  <p>Such seas as these he had never imagined round Sark;
  forgetting that behind Guernsey lay thousands of miles of waters
  tortured past endurance and racing now to escape the fury of the
  storm.</p>

  <p>A white lash of spray came over him as he lay, and soaked him
  to the skin, and, turning his face to the storm, he saw through
  the chinks of his eyes a great wavering white curtain between him
  and the sky line. The south-west portion of his island, where his
  freshwater pools were, and the valley of rocks, were all awash,
  the mighty waves roaring clean over the south stack, and rushing
  up into the black sky in rockets of flying spray. The tide had
  still some time to run, and he feared what it might be like at
  its fullest. It seemed to him by no means impossible that it
  might sweep the whole rock bare.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

  <h3>HOW HE LIVED THROUGH THE GREAT STORM</h3>

  <p>It was a fortunate thing for Gard that the storm&mdash;the
  great storm from which, for many a year afterwards, local events
  in Sark dated&mdash;came when it did; two days after Bernel's
  visit and the replenishment of his larder. For if he had been
  caught bare he must have starved.</p>

  <p>Eight whole days it lasted, with only two slight abatements
  which, while they raised his hopes only to dash them, still
  served him mightily.</p>

  <p>During the first days he spent much of his time crouched in
  the lee of his bee-hive, watching the terrific play of the waves
  on his own rock and on the Sark headlands.</p>

  <p>He wondered if any other man had seen such a storm under such
  conditions. For he was practically at sea on a rock; in the midst
  of the turmoil, yet absolutely unaffected by it.</p>

  <p>On shipboard, thought of one's ship and possible consequences
  had always interfered with fullest enjoyment of Nature's
  paroxysms. It was impossible to detach one's thoughts completely
  and view matters entirely from the outside. But here&mdash;he was
  sure his rock had suffered many an equal torment&mdash;there was
  nothing to come between him and the elemental frenzy. Nothing
  but&mdash;as the days of it ran on&mdash;a growing solicitude as
  to what he was going to live on if it continued much longer.</p>

  <p>Never was Sark rabbit so completely demolished as was that one
  that Nance had cooked and sent him. Before he had done with it he
  cracked the very bones he had thrown away, for the sake of what
  was in them, and finally chewed the softer parts of the bones
  themselves to cheat himself into the belief that he was
  eating.</p>

  <p>That was after he had devoured every crumb of his bread, and
  finished his three fishes to the extreme points of their
  tails.</p>

  <p>He was, I said, in the very midst of the turmoil yet
  unaffected by it. But that was not so in some respects.</p>

  <p>Bodily, as we have seen, the storm bore hardly upon him, since
  rabbit-bones and fish-tails can hardly be looked upon as a
  nutritious or inviting dietary.</p>

  <p>But mentally and spiritually the mighty elemental upheaval was
  wholly crushing and uplifting.</p>

  <p>As he cowered, with humming head, under the fierce unremitting
  rush of the gale, and felt the great stones of his shelter
  tremble in it, and watched the huge green hills of water, with
  their roaring white crests, go sweeping past to crash in thunder
  on the cliffs of Sark, he felt smaller than he had ever felt
  before&mdash;and that, as a rule, and if it come not of
  self-abnegation through a man's own sin or folly, is entirely to
  his good; possibly in the other case also.</p>

  <p>To feel infinitely small and helpless in the hands of an
  Infinitely Great is a spiritual education to any man, and it was
  so to this man.</p>

  <p>He felt himself, in that universal chaos, no more than a speck
  of helpless dust amid the whirling wheels of Nature's
  inexplicable machinery, and clung the tighter to the simple
  fundamental facts of which his heart was sure&mdash;behind and
  above all this was God, who held all these things in His hand.
  And over there in Sark was Nance, the very thought of whom was
  like a coal of fire in his heart, which all the gales that ever
  blew, and all the soddened soaking of ceaseless rain from above
  and ceaseless spray from below, could not even dim.</p>

  <p>For long-continued and relentless buffeting such as this tells
  upon any man, no matter what his strength of mind or body to
  begin with; and a perpetually soaked body is apt in time to
  sodden the soul, unless it have something superhuman to cling to,
  as this man had in his simple trust in God and the girl he
  loved.</p>

  <p>In all those stressful days, so far as he could see, the
  tides&mdash;which in those parts rise and fall some forty feet,
  as you may see by the scoured bases of the towering
  cliffs&mdash;seemed always at the full, the westerly gale driving
  in the waters remorselessly and piling them up against the land
  without cessation, and as though bent on its destruction.</p>

  <p>Great gouts of clotted foam flew over his head in clouds, and
  plastered his rock with shivering sponges. The sheets of spray
  from his south-west rocks lashed him incessantly. His shelter was
  as wet inside as out, as he was himself.</p>

  <p>He felt empty and hungry at times, but never thirsty; his skin
  absorbed moisture enough and to spare. But, chilled and clammed
  and starving, on the fifth day when he had crawled into his wet
  burrow for such small relief as it might offer from the ceaseless
  flailing without, he broached his bottle of cognac and drank a
  little, and found himself the better of it.</p>

  <p>On the evening of the third day his hopes had risen with a
  slight slackening of the turmoil. He was not sure if the gale had
  really abated, or if it was only that he was growing accustomed
  to it. But under that belief, and the compulsion of a growling
  stomach, he crawled precariously round to the eastern end of the
  rock where the puffins had their holes, lying flat when the great
  gusts snatched at him as though they were bent on hurling him
  into the water, and gliding on again in the intervals. And there,
  with a piece of his firewood he managed to extort half-a-dozen
  eggs from fiercely expostulating parents. The end of his stick
  was bitten to fragments, but he got his eggs, and was amazed at
  the size of them compared with that of their producers.</p>

  <p>The sight of the great wall of tumbled rocks on his right, and
  the sudden remembrance of his previous passage over it, set him
  wondering if it might not be possible to find better shelter in
  some of those fissures across which he had had to swing himself
  by the hands on the previous occasion. For this was the leeward
  side of the island, and the huge bulk of it rose like a
  protecting shoulder between him and the gale, whereas his
  bee-hive, on the exposed flank of the rock, got the full force of
  it. So he scooped a hole in the friable black soil and deposited
  his eggs in it and crawled along to the wall.</p>

  <p>The tumbled fragments looked much less fearsome than they had
  done in the fog. He found no difficulty in clambering among them
  now, when he could see clearly what he was about, and he wormed
  his way in and out, and up and down, but could not light on any
  of those tricky spaces which had seemed to him so dangerous
  before.</p>

  <p>And then, as he crawled under one huge slab, a black void lay
  before him, of no great width but evidently deep. It took many
  minutes' peering into the depths to accustom his eyes to the
  dimness.</p>

  <p>Then it seemed to him that the rough out jutting fragments
  below would afford a holding, and he swung his feet cautiously
  down and felt round for foothold.</p>

  <p>Carefully testing everything he touched, he let himself down,
  inch by inch, assured that if he could go down he could certainly
  get up again.</p>

  <p>At first the gale still whistled through the crevices among
  the boulders, but presently he found himself in a silence that
  was so mighty a change from the ceaseless roar to which he was
  becoming accustomed, that he felt as though stricken with
  deafness. Up above him the light filtered down, tempered by the
  slab under which he had come, and enabled him still to find
  precarious hand and foot hold.</p>

  <p>But presently his downward progress was barred by a rough
  flooring of splintered fragments, and he stood panting and looked
  about him.</p>

  <p>His well was about twenty feet deep, he reckoned, and there
  were gaping slits here and there which might lead in towards the
  rock or out towards the sea. He had turned and twisted so much in
  his descent that it took him some time to decide in which
  direction the sea might lie and in which the rock. And, having
  settled that, he wriggled through a crevice and wormed slowly
  on.</p>

  <p>He was almost in the dark now, and could only feel his way.
  But he was used to groping in narrow places, and a spirit of
  investigation urged him on.</p>

  <p>Half an hour's strenuous and cautious worming, and a thin
  trickle of light glimmered ahead. He turned and worked his way
  back at once.</p>

  <p>There was no slit opposite the one he had tried, but
  presently, half-way up the well, he made out an opening like the
  mouth of a small adit. His back had been to it as he came down,
  and so he had missed it.</p>

  <p>He climbed up and in, and felt convinced in his own mind that
  this was no simple work of nature. Nature had no doubt begun, but
  man had certainly finished it. For the floor level was
  comparatively free from harshness, and the outjutting projections
  of the sides and roof had been tempered, and progress was not
  difficult.</p>

  <p>It was very narrow, however, and very low, and quite dark. He
  could only drag himself along on his stomach like a worm. But he
  pushed on with all the ardour of a discoverer.</p>

  <p>Was it silver? Was it smugglers? Or what? Wholly accidental
  formation he was sure it was not, though he thought it likely
  that man's handiwork had only turned Nature's to account.</p>

  <p>The fissure had probably been there from the beginning of
  time, or it might be the result of numberless years of the slow
  wearing away of a softer vein of rock, but some man at some time
  had lighted on it, and followed it up, and with much labour had
  smoothed its natural asperities and used it for his own purposes.
  And he was keen to learn what those purposes were.</p>

  <p>To any ordinary man, accustomed to the ordinary amplitudes of
  life, and freedom to stretch his arms and legs and raise his head
  and fill his lungs with fresh air, a passage such as this would
  have been impossible. Here and there, indeed, the walls widened
  somewhat through some fault in the rook, bur for the most part
  his elbows grazed the sides each time he moved them.</p>

  <p>Even he, used as he was to such conditions, began at last to
  feel them oppressive. The whole mighty bulk of L'Etat seemed
  above and about him, malignantly intent on crushing him out of
  existence.</p>

  <p>He knew that was only fancy. He had experienced it many times
  before. But the nightmare feeling was there, and it needed all
  his will at times to keep him from a panic attempt at retreat,
  when the insensate rock-walls seemed absolutely settling down on
  him, and breathing was none too easy.</p>

  <p>But going back meant literally going backwards, crawling out
  toes foremost; for his elbows scraped the walls and his head the
  roof, and turning was out of the question. The men who had made
  and used that narrow way had undoubtedly gone with a purpose, and
  not for pleasure. And he was bound to learn what that purpose
  was.</p>

  <p>So he set his teeth, and wormed himself slowly along, with
  pinched face and tight-shut mouth, and nostrils opened wide to
  take in all the air they could and let out as little as possible.
  And, even at that, he had to lie still at times, pressed flat
  against the floor, to let some fresher air trickle in above
  him.</p>

  <p>But at last he came to what he sought, though no whit of it
  could he see when he got there. By the sudden cessation of the
  pressure on his sides and head, he was aware of entrance into a
  larger space, and, with forethought quickened by the exigences of
  his passage, he lay for a moment to pant more freely and to
  think.</p>

  <p>His body was in the passage. He knew where the passage led out
  to. What lay ahead he could not tell.</p>

  <p>If it was a chamber, as he expected, there might quite
  possibly be other passages leading out of it. And so it would be
  well to make sure of recognizing this one again before he loosed
  his hold on it. So he pulled off one boot, and feeling carefully
  round the opening, placed it just inside as a landmark.</p>

  <p>Then he groped on along the right-hand wall to learn the size
  of the chamber, and was immediately thankful that his own passage
  was safely marked, for he came on another opening, and another,
  and another, and labelled them carefully in his mind, "One, two,
  three."</p>

  <p>It was truly eerie work, groping there in that dense darkness
  and utter silence, and trying to the nerves even of one who had
  never known himself guilty of such things. But, being there, he
  was determined to learn all he could.</p>

  <p>He clung to his right-hand wall as to a life-rope. If he once
  got mazed in a place like that he might never taste daylight and
  upper air again.</p>

  <p>Of the size of the chamber he could so far form no opinion. He
  would have given much for a light. His flint and steel were
  indeed in his pocket, but he was sodden through and through, and
  had no means whatever of catching a spark if he struck one.</p>

  <p>Then, as he groped cautiously along past the third opening,
  his progress was stayed, and not by rock.</p>

  <p>He was on his knees, his hands feeling blindly, but with
  infinite enquiry, along the rough rock wall, when he stumbled
  suddenly over something that lay along the ground. Dropping his
  hands to save himself from falling, they lighted on that which
  lay below, and he started back with an exclamation and a shudder.
  For what he had felt was like the hair and face of a man.</p>

  <p>He crouched back against the wall, his heart thumping like a
  ship's pump, and the blood belling in his ears, and sat so for
  very many minutes; sat on, until, in that silent blackness, he
  could hear the dull, far-away thud of the waves on the outer
  walls of the island.</p>

  <p>Then, by degrees, he pulled himself together. If it was indeed
  a man, he was undoubtedly dead, and therefore harmless; and
  having learned this much he would know more.</p>

  <p>So presently he groped forward, felt again the round head and
  soft hair, and below it and beyond it a heap of what felt like
  small oblong packages done up in wrappings of cloth and tied
  round with cord.</p>

  <p>He picked one up and handled it inquisitively, with a shrewd
  idea of what might be, or might have been, inside. The cord was
  very loose, as though the contents had shrunk since it was tied.
  As he fumbled with it in the dark, it came open and left him no
  possible room for doubt as to what those contents were. He
  sneezed till the top of his head seemed like to lift, and the
  tears ran down his cheeks in an unceasing stream. What had once
  been tobacco had powdered into snuff, and his rough handling of
  the package had scattered it broadcast.</p>

  <p>He turned at last, and lay with his head in his arms against
  the wall until the air should have time to clear, and meanwhile
  the sneezing had quickened his wits.</p>

  <p>Here was possible tinder, and by means of those dried-up
  wrappings he might procure a light. If it lasted but five minutes
  it might enable him to solve the problem on which he had
  stumbled.</p>

  <p>He groped again for the opened package, and found it on the
  dead man's face. The wrapper was of tarred cloth, almost perished
  with age, dry and friable. Shaking out the rest of the snuff at
  arm's length, he picked the stuff to pieces and shredded it into
  tinder. Then he felt about for half-a-dozen more packages,
  carefully slipped their cords and emptied out their contents, and
  getting out his flint and steel, flaked sparks into the tinder
  till it caught and flared, and the interior of the cavern leaped
  at him out of its darkness.</p>

  <p>He rolled up one of the empty wrappers like a torch, and lit
  it, and looked about him.</p>

  <p>His first hasty glance fell on the dead man, and he got
  another shock from the fact that his feet were lashed together
  with stout rope, and probably his hands also, for they were
  behind his back, and he lay face upward. His coat and
  short-clothes and buckled shoes spoke of long by-gone days, and
  the skin of his face was brown and shrivelled, so that the bones
  beneath showed grim and gaunt.</p>

  <p>Beyond him was a great heap of the same small packages of
  tobacco, and alongside them a pile of small kegs. Gard lit
  another of his torches, and stepped gingerly over to them. He
  sounded one or two, but found them empty. Time had shrunk their
  stout timbers and tapped their contents.</p>

  <p>Then he held up his flickering light and looked quickly round
  this prison-house which had turned into a tomb, and shivered, as
  a dim idea of what it all meant came over him.</p>

  <p>It was a large, low, natural rock chamber, and all round the
  walls were black slits which might mean it passages leading on
  into the bowels of the island. To investigate them all would mean
  the work of many days.</p>

  <p>The dead man, the perished packages, the empty
  kegs&mdash;there was nothing else, except his own boot lying in
  the mouth of the largest of the black slits, as though anxious on
  its own account to be gone.</p>

  <p>The still air was already becoming heavy with the pungent
  smoke of his torches. He stepped cautiously across to the body
  again, and picked a couple of buttons from the coat. They came
  off in his hand, and when he touched the buckles on the shoes
  they did the same. Then he turned and made for his waiting shoe
  just as his last torch went out.</p>

  <p>The smell of the fresh salt air, when he wriggled out into the
  well, was almost as good as a feast to him. He climbed hastily to
  the surface, and, as he crept out from under the topmost slab,
  took careful note of its position, and then scored with a piece
  of rock each stone which led up to it. For, if ever he should
  need an inner sanctuary, here was one to his hand, and evidently
  quite unknown to the present generation of Sark men.</p>

  <p>He recovered his eggs, and crept round the shoulder of the
  rock. The gale pounced on him like a tiger on its half-escaped
  prey. It beat him flat, worried him, did its best to tear him off
  and fling him into the sea. But&mdash;Heavens!&mdash;how sweet it
  was after the musty quiet of the death-chamber below!</p>

  <p>Inch by inch, he worked his way back in the teeth of it, and
  crawled spent into his bee-hive. Then, ravenous with his
  exertions, he broke one of his eggs into his tin dipper, and
  forthwith emptied it outside, and the gale swept away the awful
  smell of it.</p>

  <p>The next was as bad, and his hopes sank to nothing.</p>

  <p>The third, however, was all right. He mixed it with some
  cognac and whipped it up with a stick, and the growlers inside
  fought over it contentedly.</p>

  <p>He was almost afraid to try another. However, he could get
  more to-morrow. So he broke the fourth, and found it also good,
  so whipped it up with more cognac, and felt happier than he had
  done since he nibbled his rabbit-bones.</p>

  <p>As he lay that night, and the gale howled about him more
  furiously than ever, his thoughts ran constantly on the dead man
  lying in the silent darkness down below.</p>

  <p>It was very quiet down there, and dry; but this roaring
  turmoil, with its thunderous crashings and hurtling spray, was
  infinitely more to his taste, wet though he was to the bone, and
  almost deafened with the ceaseless uproar. For this, terrible
  though it was in its majestic fury, was life, and that black
  stillness below was death.</p>

  <p>To the tune of the tumult without, he worked out the dead
  man's story in his mind.</p>

  <p>It was long ago in the old smuggling days. Some bold
  free-trader of Sark or Guernsey had lighted on that cave and used
  it as a storehouse. Some too energetic revenue officer had
  disappeared one day and never been heard of again. He had been
  surprised&mdash;by the free-traders&mdash;perhaps in the very act
  of surprising them&mdash;brought over to L'Etat in a boat, been
  dragged through the tunnel, or made to crawl through, perhaps,
  with vicious knife-digs in the rear, and had been left bound in
  the darkness till he should be otherwise disposed of. His captors
  had been captured in turn, or maybe killed, and he had lain there
  alone and in the dark, waiting, waiting for them to return,
  shouting now and again into the muffling darkness, struggling
  with his bonds, growing weaker and weaker, faint with hunger, mad
  with thirst, until at last he died.</p>

  <p>It was horrible to think of, and desperate as his own state
  was, he thanked God heartily that he was not as that other.</p>

  <p>Morning brought no slackening of the gale. It seemed to him,
  if anything, to be waxing still more furious.</p>

  <p>He had only two eggs left, and they might both be bad ones,
  but he would not have ventured round the headland that day for
  all the eggs in existence.</p>

  <p>He broke one presently, in answer to a clamour inside him that
  would brook no denial, and found it good, and lived on it that
  day, and mused between times on the strange fact that a man could
  feel so mightily grateful for the difference between a bad egg
  and a good one.</p>

  <p>His sixth egg turned out a good one also, and the next day
  there came another hopeful lull, which permitted him to harry the
  puffins once more, and gave him a dozen chances against
  contingencies.</p>

  <p>On the eighth day the storm blew itself out, and he looked
  hopefully across at the lonely and weather-beaten cliffs of Sark
  for the relief which he was certain they had been aching to send
  him.</p>

  <p>The waves, however, still ran high, and, though he did not
  know it till later, there was not a boat left afloat round the
  whole Island. The forethoughtful and weather-wise had run them
  round to the Creux and carried them through the tunnel into the
  roadway behind. All the rest had been smashed and sunk and
  swallowed by the storm.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER
  XXVI</h2>

  <h3>HOW HE HELD THE ROCK</h3>

  <p>The sun blazed hot next day, and he spread himself out in it
  to warm, and all his soaked things in it to dry, and blessed it
  for its wholesome vigour.</p>

  <p>Nance or Bernel would be sure to come as soon as the tide
  served at night, and he would net be sorry for a change of diet;
  meanwhile, he could get along all right with the unwilling
  assistance of the puffins.</p>

  <p>The birds had all crept out of their hiding-places, and were
  wheeling and diving and making up for lost time and busily
  discussing late events at the tops of their voices whenever their
  bills were not otherwise occupied. Where they had all hidden
  themselves during the storm, he could not imagine, but there
  seemed to be as many of them as ever, and they were all quite
  happy and quarrelsome, except the cormorants, who were so
  ravenous that they could not spare a moment from their diving and
  gobbling, even to quarrel with their neighbours.</p>

  <p>He levied on the puffins again, and, after a meal, prowled
  curiously about his rock to see what damage the storm had done,
  but to his surprise found almost none.</p>

  <p>It seemed incredible that all should be the same after the
  deadly onslaught of the gale. But it was only in the valley of
  rocks that he found any consequences.</p>

  <p>There the huge boulders had been hurled about like marbles:
  some had been tossed overboard, and some, in their fantastic
  up-piling, spoke eloquently of all they had suffered.</p>

  <p>But one grim&mdash;though to him wholly gracious&mdash;deed
  the storm had wrought there. For, out of the pool where the
  devil-fish dwelt, its monstrous limbs streamed up and lay over
  the sloping rocks, and he dared not venture near. But, in the
  afternoon when he came again to look at it, and found it still in
  the same attitude, something about it struck him as odd and
  unusual.</p>

  <p>The great tentacles had never moved, so far as he could see,
  and there was surely something wrong with a devil-fish that did
  not move.</p>

  <p>He hurled a stone, picked out of the landslip at the corner,
  and hit a tentacle full and fair with a dull thud like leather.
  But the beast never moved.</p>

  <p>He was suspicious of the wily one, however. The devil, he
  knew, was sometimes busiest when he made least show of business.
  And it was not till next morning, when he found the monster still
  as before, that he ventured down to the pool and looked into it,
  and saw what had happened.</p>

  <p>The waves had hurled a huge boulder into it&mdash;and there
  you may see it to this day&mdash;and it had fallen on the
  devil-fish and ground him flat, and purged the rock of a
  horror.</p>

  <p>Gard examined the hideous tentacles with the curiosity of
  intensest repulsion; yet could not but stand amazed at the
  wonderful delicacy and finish displayed in the tiny powerful
  suckers with which each limb was furnished on the under side, and
  the flexible muscularity of the monstrous limbs themselves, thick
  as his biceps where they came out of the pool, and tapering to a
  worm-like point, capable, it seemed to him, of picking up a
  pin.</p>

  <p>He was mightily glad the beast was dead, however. It had been
  a blot on Nature's handiwork, and the very thought of it a
  horror.</p>

  <p>The strenuous interlude of the storm, which, to the lonely one
  exposed to its fullest fury, had seemed interminable&mdash;every
  shivering day the length of many, and the black howling nights
  longer still&mdash;had had the effect of relaxing somewhat his
  own oversight over himself and his precautions against being
  seen.</p>

  <p>L'Etat in a furious sou'-wester is a sight worth seeing.
  Possibly some telescope had been brought to bear on the
  foam-swept rock when he, secure in the general bouleversement and
  cramped with hunger, had turned the forbidden corner with no
  thought in his mind but eggs.</p>

  <p>Possibly again, it was sheer carelessness on his part, born
  once more of the security of the storm and the recent
  non-necessity for concealment.</p>

  <p>However it came about, what happened was that, as he stood in
  the valley of rocks examining his dead monster, he became
  suddenly aware that a fishing-boat had crept round the open end
  of the valley, and that it seemed to him much closer in than he
  had ever seen one before.</p>

  <p>He dropped prone among the boulders at once, but whether he
  had been seen he could not tell&mdash;could only vituperate his
  own carelessness, and hope that nothing worse might come of
  it.</p>

  <p>He lay there a very long time, and when at last he ventured to
  crawl to the rocks at the seaward opening, the boat was away on
  the usual fishing-grounds busy with its own concerns, and he
  persuaded himself that its somewhat unusual course had been
  accidental. The incident, however, braced him to his former
  caution, and he went no more abroad without first carefully
  inspecting the surrounding waters from the ridge.</p>

  <p>They would be certain to come that night, he felt sure, either
  Nance or Bernel, perhaps both. Yes, he thought most likely they
  would both come. They would, without doubt, be wondering how he
  had fared during the storm, and would be making provision for
  him.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Nance was cooking for him at that very moment, and
  thinking of him as he was of her.</p>

  <p>In the certain expectation of their coming, he decided he
  would not go to sleep at all that night, but would crawl down to
  the landing-place to welcome them.</p>

  <p>He wondered if that mad woman Julie had given up watching
  them, and, if not, if they would be able to circumvent her again.
  In any case, he hoped that if only one of them came it might be
  Nance. He fairly ached for the sight and sound of her&mdash;and
  the feel of her little hand, and a warm frank kiss from the lips
  that knew no guile.</p>

  <p>The sufferings of the storm became as nothing to him in this
  large hope and expectation of her coming.</p>

  <p>The intervening hours dragged slowly. It would be half-ebb
  soon after dark, he thought; and he crept up to the ridge and
  gazed anxiously over at the Race between him and Breni&egrave;re,
  to see if it showed any unusual symptoms after the storm.</p>

  <p>It ran furiously enough, but, he said to himself, it would
  slacken on the ebb, and they were so familiar with it that it
  would take more than that to stop them coming.</p>

  <p>Before dark the great seas were rolling past, a little quicker
  than usual, he thought, but in long, smooth undulations, which
  slipped, unbroken and soundless, even along the black ledges of
  his rock. And when the stars came out&mdash;brighter than ever
  with the burnishing of the gale&mdash;the long black backs of the
  waves, and the darker hollows between, were sown so thick with
  trailing gleams that he could not be certain whether it was only
  star-shine or phosphorescence.</p>

  <p>It was all very peaceful and beautiful, however, and very
  welcome to eyes that had not looked upon sun, moon, or star for
  eight whole nights and days, and whose ears had grown hardened to
  the ceaseless clamour of the gale. Nature, indeed, seemed
  preternaturally quiet, as though exhausted with her previous
  violence or desirous of wiping out the remembrance of it; just as
  small humanity after an outbreak endeavours at times to purge the
  memory of its offence by display of unusual amiability and
  sweetness.</p>

  <p>Eager to welcome his confidently expected visitors, Gard crept
  along the ridge as soon as it was dark, and posted himself on the
  point which, in the daylight, commanded the passage from
  Breni&egrave;re.</p>

  <p>And he sat there so long&mdash;so long after his hopes and
  wishes had flown over to Sark and hurried Bernel and Nance into a
  boat and landed them on L'Etat&mdash;that the night seemed
  running out, and he began to fear they were not coming, after
  all.</p>

  <p>In the troubled darkness of the Race, he caught gleams at
  times which might be oar-blades or might be only the upfling from
  the perils below. The tide was ebbing, and soon the black fangs
  with which it was strewn would be showing.</p>

  <p>At times he convinced himself that the brief gleams moved; but
  when, to ease his eyes of the intolerable strain, he looked up at
  the stars, it seemed to him that they moved also, and so he could
  not be sure.</p>

  <p>But surely there was a gleam that seemed to move and come
  fitfully towards him&mdash;or was it only star-shine dancing on
  the waves of the Race which always ran against the tide?</p>

  <p>He stood to watch, then lost the gleam, and crouched again
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>The boat must come round Quette d'Amont, the great pile of
  rock that lay off the eastern corner, and the first glimpse he
  could hope to get of it in the darkness would be there.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, in that curious way in which one sometimes
  sees more out of the tail of one's eye than out of the front of
  it, he got an impression&mdash;and with it a start&mdash;of
  something moving noiselessly among the tumbled rocks below on his
  left.</p>

  <p>It was a dark night, but the glory of the stars lifted it out
  of the ebony-ruler category. It was a wide, thin, lofty darkness,
  but still black enough along the sides of his rock, and down
  there it seemed to him that something moved, something dim and
  shadowy and silent.</p>

  <p>He thought of the dead man in his chamber down below. Could he
  be in the habit of walking of a night? He thought of ghosts, of
  which, if popular belief was anything to go by, Sark was full;
  and there was nothing to hinder them coming across to L'Etat for
  their Sabbat. And he thought of monster devil-fish climbing,
  loathsome and soundless, about the dark rocks.</p>

  <p>He longed for a pair of Sark eyes, and shrank down into a
  hollow under the ridge to watch this thing, with something of a
  creepy chill between his shoulder-blades.</p>

  <p>There was certainly something lighter than the surrounding
  darkness down below, and it moved. It turned the corner and
  flitted along the slope, slowly but surely, in the direction of
  his shelter. Its mode of progression, from the little he could
  make out in the darkness, was just such as he would have looked
  for in a huge octopus hauling itself along by its tentacles over
  the out-cropping rock-bones.</p>

  <p>He could not rest there. He must see. He crawled along the
  ridge as quietly as he could manage it, and would have felt
  happier, whatever it was, spirit or monster, if he had had his
  gun. Now and again it stopped, and when it stopped he lay flat to
  the ground and held his breath, lest it should discover him. When
  it went on, he went on.</p>

  <p>When he came to the end of the ridge he saw that the nebulous
  something had apparently stopped just where his house must
  be.</p>

  <p>And then, every sense on the strain, he heard his own name
  called softly, and he laughed to himself for very joy of it, and
  lay still to hear it again, and laughed once more to think that
  in her simplicity she still thought of him as "Mr. Gard." He
  would teach her to call him "Steen," as his mother used to
  do.</p>

  <p>Then he got up quickly and cried, as softly as herself, but
  with joy and laughter in his voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Why, Nance! My dear, I was not sure whether you were a ghost
  or a devil-fish;" and he sprang down towards her.</p>

  <p>And then, to his amazement, he saw that she was clad only in
  the clinging white garment in which he had seen her swim.</p>

  <p>Her next words confounded him.</p>

  <p>"Is Bernel here?"</p>

  <p>"Bernel, Nance? No, dear, he is not here. Why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did he not get here last night?" she jerked sharply.</p>

  <p>"No. No one. I was hoping&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she had sunk down against the great stones of the shelter,
  with her hands before her face.</p>

  <p>"Mon Gyu, mon Gyu! Then he is dead! Oh, my poor one! My dear
  one!"</p>

  <p>"Nance! Nance! What is it all, dearest? Did Bernel try to come
  across last night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! He would come. He said you must be starving. We
  were all anxious about you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And he tried to swim across?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! And he is drowned! Oh, my poor, poor boy!"</p>

  <p>She was shaking with the sudden chill of dreadful loss. He
  stooped, and felt inside the shelter with a long arm for the old
  woollen cloak and wrapped her carefully in it. He raked out the
  blanket and made her sit with it tucked about her feet. And she
  was passive in his hands, with thought as yet for nothing but her
  loss.</p>

  <p>She was shaken with broken sobs, and in the face of grief such
  as this he could find no words. What could he say? All the words
  in the world could not bring back the dead.</p>

  <p>And it was through him this great sorrow had come upon her. He
  seemed fated to bring misfortune on their house.</p>

  <p>He wondered if she would hate him for it, though she must know
  he had had no more to do with the matter than with Tom's
  death.</p>

  <p>He put a protecting arm round the old cloak, tentatively, and
  in some fear lest she might resent it, but knew no other way to
  convey to her what was in his heart.</p>

  <p>But she did not resent it, and nothing was further from her
  mind than imputing any share in this loss to him.</p>

  <p>Some women's hearts are so wonderfully constituted that the
  greater the demands upon them the more they are prepared to give.
  At times they give and give beyond the bounds of reason, and yet
  amazingly retain their faith and hope in the recipients of their
  gifts.</p>

  <p>But that has nothing to do with our story. Except
  this&mdash;that these various demands on Nance's fortitude,
  incurred by her love for Stephen Gard, far from weakening her
  love only made it the stronger. As that love came more and more
  between her and her old surroundings, and exacted from her
  sacrifice after sacrifice, the more she clung to it, and looked
  to it, and let the past go. The partial ostracism brought upon
  her by Gard's outspoken declaration of their mutual
  feeling&mdash;even this final offering of her dearly-loved
  brother&mdash;these only bound her heart to him the tighter.</p>

  <p>"Nance dear!" he said at last, when she had got control of
  herself again. "Is it not possible to hope? He was so good a
  swimmer. Maybe he found the Race too strong and was carried away
  by it. He may have been picked up, and will come back as soon as
  he is able."</p>

  <p>"No," she said, with gloomy decision. "He is dead. I feared
  for him, for I had been to look at the Race just before sundown,
  and it looked terribly strong. But he would go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't he get a boat?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, mon Gyu!" and she started up wildly. "I was forgetting. I
  was thinking only of myself and Bernel. There isn't a boat left
  alive outside the Creux, and he couldn't get one there without
  them knowing. But"&mdash;in quick excitement now, to make up for
  lost time&mdash;"they have seen you here, and they may come
  to-night&mdash;Achochre that I am! They may be here! Come
  quickly! Your gun!" and she was all on the quiver to be gone.</p>

  <p>Gard stooped and pulled out the gun from its hiding-place
  inside the shelter.</p>

  <p>"Is it loaded?" she asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I cleaned it to-day."</p>

  <p>"Take your charges with you, and do you hasten back to the
  place we landed the first night. You know?"</p>

  <p>"I know. And you?"</p>

  <p>"I will go to the other landing-place. But they are not likely
  to come there."</p>

  <p>"And if they do?"</p>

  <p>"I will manage them," and she slipped into the darkness with
  the big cloak about her.</p>

  <p>Gard crept along the slope, and found a roost above the
  landing-place.</p>

  <p>His brain was in a whirl. Bernel had tried to cross to him and
  was drowned. Nance had swum across. Brave girl! Wonderful girl!
  For him!&mdash;and for news of Bernel. It was terrible to think
  of Bernel, dead on his account&mdash;terrible! It would not be
  surprising if Nance hated him. Yet, what had he done?&mdash;what
  could he do? He had done nothing. He could do nothing; and his
  teeth ground savagely at the craziness of these wild Sark men who
  had brought it all about, and at his own utter impotence.</p>

  <p>But Nance did not hate him. And she had swum that dreadful
  Race to warn him. Brave girl! Wonderful girl!</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;surely the grinding of an oar, as it wrought
  upon the gunwale against an ill-fitted thole-pin&mdash;out there
  by the Quette d'Amont!</p>

  <p>His eyes and ears strained into the darkness till they felt
  like cracking.</p>

  <p>And the muffled growl of voices!</p>

  <p>His heart thumped so, they might have heard it.</p>

  <p>He must wait till he was sure they meant to come in. But they
  must not come too close.</p>

  <p>It was an ill landing in the dark, and there were various
  opinions on it. But there was no doubt as to their intentions.
  They were coming in.</p>

  <p>"Sheer off there!" cried Gard.</p>

  <p>Dead silence below. They had come in some doubt, but their
  doubts were solved now, and there was no longer need for curbed
  tongues, though, indeed, his hollow voice made some of them
  wonder if it was not a spirit that spoke to them.</p>

  <p>"It's him!" "The man himself!" "We have him!" "In now and get
  him!"&mdash;was the burden of their growls, as they hung on their
  oars.</p>

  <p>"See here, men!" said Gard, invisible even to Sark eyes,
  against the solid darkness of the slope. "There has been trouble
  and loss enough over this matter already, and none of it my
  making. Do you hear? I say again&mdash;none of it my making. If
  you attempt to come ashore there will be more trouble, and this
  time it will be of my making. Keep back!"&mdash;as an impulsive
  one gave a tug at his oar. "If you force me to fire, your blood
  be on your own heads. I give you fair warning."</p>

  <p>Growls from the boat carried up to him an impression of mixed
  doubt and discomfort&mdash;ultimate disbelief in his possession
  of arms, an energetic oath or two, and another creak of the
  oar.</p>

  <p>"Very well! Here's to show you I am armed." The report of his
  gun made Nance jump, at the other side of the island, and set all
  the birds on L'Etat&mdash;except the puffins, deep in their
  holes&mdash;circling and screaming.</p>

  <p>The small shot tore up the water within a couple of yards of
  the boat, which backed off hastily&mdash;much to his
  satisfaction, for he had feared they might rush him before he had
  time to reload.</p>

  <p>He had dropped flat after firing and recharged his gun as he
  lay. He was sure they must have come armed, and feared a volley
  as soon as his own discharge indicated his whereabouts.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, they had come divided as to the truth of
  the report that there was a man on L'Etat&mdash;even then as to
  him being the man they sought. In any case, they had expected to
  take him unawares, and never dreamt of his being armed and on the
  watch for them.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Nance, he had turned the tables on them. It was they
  who were taken unawares.</p>

  <p>But if he spoke again, he said to himself, they would be ready
  for him, and their answers would probably take the rude form of
  bullets. So he lay still and waited.</p>

  <p>There was a growling disputation in the boat. Then one
  spoke&mdash;</p>

  <p>"See then, you, Gard! We will haff you yet, now we know where
  you are. If it takes effery man and effery boat in Sark, we will
  haff you, now we know where you are. You do not kill a Sark man
  like that and go free. Noh&mdash;pardie!"</p>

  <p>"I have killed no man&mdash;" A gun rang out in the boat, and
  the shot spatted on the rocks not a yard from him.</p>

  <p>Coming in, they knew, meant certain death for one among them,
  and, keen as they were to lay hands on him, no man had any wish
  to be that one.</p>

  <p>The oars creaked away into the darkness, and he climbed to the
  ridge to make sure they made no attempt on the other side.</p>

  <p>But discretion had prevailed. One man could not hold L'Etat
  from invasion at half-a-dozen points at once. They could bide
  their time, and take him by force of numbers.</p>

  <p>He heard them go creaking off towards the Creux, and turned
  and went back along the ridge to find Nance.</p>

  <h3>HOW ONE CAME TO HIM LIKE AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN</h3>

  <p>Nance was standing by the shelter, and even in the darkness he
  could tell that she was shaking, in spite of her previous
  vigorous incitement to defence.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you didn't kill any of them?" she asked
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No, dear. I warned them off and fired into the water to show
  them I was armed."</p>

  <p>"I was afraid. But, there were two shots."</p>

  <p>"One of them fired back the next time I spoke, but I was
  expecting it."</p>

  <p>"They are wicked, wicked men, and cruel."</p>

  <p>"They are mistaken, that's all. But it comes to much the same
  thing, and I don't see," he said despondently, "how we are ever
  to prove it to them."</p>

  <p>"They will come again."</p>

  <p>"Yes, they are to come back with every man and every boat in
  the Island. I shall have my hands full. Are there more than these
  two places where they can land?"</p>

  <p>"Not good places, and these only when the sea is right. But
  angry men&mdash;and ready to shoot you&mdash;oh, it is
  wicked&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We must hope the sea will keep them off, and that something
  may turn up to throw some light on the other matter," he said,
  trying to comfort her, though, in truth, the outlook was not
  hopeful, and he feared himself that his time might be short.</p>

  <p>"I will stop here and help you," she said, with sudden
  vehemence. "They shall not have you. They shall not! They are
  wicked, crazy men," and the little cloaked figure shook again
  with the spirit that was in it.</p>

  <p>"Dear!" he said, putting his arm round her, and drawing her
  close. "You must not stop. They must not know you have been here.
  I do not know what the end will be. We are in God's hands, and we
  have done no wrong. But if ... if the worst comes, you will
  remember all your life, dear, that to one man you were as an
  angel from heaven. Nance! Nance! Oh, my dear, how can I tell you
  all you are to me!"&mdash;and as he pressed her to him, the bare
  white arms stole out of the cloak and clasped him tightly round
  the neck.</p>

  <p>"But how are you going to get back, little one? You cannot
  possibly swim that Race again?" he asked presently, holding her
  still in his arms and looking down at her anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can swim," she said valiantly. "I knew it would be
  worse than usual, and I brought these"&mdash;and she slipped from
  his arms and groped on the ground, and presently held up what
  felt to him in the darkness like a pair of inflated bladders with
  a broad band between them. "And here is a little bread and meat,
  all I could carry tied on to my head. We feared you would be
  starving."</p>

  <p>"You should not have burdened yourself, dear. It might have
  drowned you. And I have eggs&mdash;puffins'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ach!"</p>

  <p>"They are better than nothing, and I beat them up with cognac.
  But are you safe in the Race, Nance dear, even with those
  things?"</p>

  <p>"You cannot sink. If Bernel had only taken them! But he
  laughed at them, and now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He kissed her sobs away, but was full of anxiety at thought of
  her in the rushing darkness of the Race.</p>

  <p>"I will go with you," he said eagerly, "and you will lend me
  your bladders to get back with."</p>

  <p>"You would never get back to L'Etat in the dark"&mdash;and he
  knew that that was true. "We of Sark can see, but you
  others&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall be in misery till I know you are all right," he said
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I will run home. My things are in the gorse above
  Breni&egrave;re. And I will get a lantern and come down by
  Breni&egrave;re and wave it to you."</p>

  <p>"Will you do that? It will be like a signal from heaven," he
  said eagerly, "a signal from heaven waved by an angel from
  heaven."</p>

  <p>"And to-morrow I will go to the Vicar, and the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, and the Seigneur, if he has come home,
  and I will make them stop these wicked men from coming here
  again."</p>

  <p>"Can they?"</p>

  <p>"They shall. They must. They are the law and it is not
  right."</p>

  <p>"It is worth trying, at any rate," he said cheerfully, as they
  reached the eastern corner and struck down across his
  puffin-warren to the point immediately opposite Breni&egrave;re.
  But he had not much hope that the Vicar and the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal and the Seigneur all combined would avail
  him, for the men of Sark are a law unto themselves.</p>

  <p>"But I've found another hiding-place, Nance, where they could
  never find me."</p>

  <p>"Here?&mdash;on L'Etat?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;inside. I'll show you some time, perhaps,
  if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is this where you came ashore?" he asked, as she came to a
  stand on a rough black shelf up which the waves hissed white and
  venomous.</p>

  <p>"We&mdash;we always landed here when we swam across," she
  said, with a little break in her voice, as it came home to her
  again that Bernel would swim the Race no more.</p>

  <p>"Nance dear, don't give up hope. He may come back yet."</p>

  <p>"I have only you left, and they want to kill you," she said
  sadly.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could come with you," as the dark waters swirled
  below them. "It feels terrible to let you go into that all
  alone."</p>

  <p>"It is nothing. The tide is dead slack, and I have
  these"&mdash;swinging the bladders in her hand&mdash;"if I get
  tired. Oh, if Bern had only taken them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will kneel on the ridge and pray for your safety till I see
  your light. Dear, God keep you, and bless you for all your
  goodness and courage!"</p>

  <p>He strained her to him again, as if he could not let her go to
  that colder embrace that awaited her below.</p>

  <p>"I could kiss the very rocks you have stood on," he said
  passionately.</p>

  <p>She kissed him back and dropped the cloak, waited a second
  till a wave had swirled by, then launched into the slack of it,
  and was gone.</p>

  <p>He stood long, peering and listening into the darkness, but
  heard only the welter of the water under the black ledges below,
  and its scornful hiss as it seethed through the fringing
  sea-weeds.</p>

  <p>Then at last he turned and climbed, slowly and heavily, up to
  the ridge; for now he felt the strain of these last full hours,
  coming on top of the longer strain of the storm; and this, and
  the lack of proper feeding, made him feel weak and empty and
  weary. He knelt down there in the darkness, with his face towards
  the Race where Nance was battling with the hungry black waters,
  and he prayed for her safety as he had never prayed for anything
  in his life before.</p>

  <p>"<i>God keep her! God keep her! God keep her&mdash;and bring her
  safe to land! O God, keep her, keep her, keep her, and bring her
  safe to land!</i>"</p>

  <p>It was a monotonous little prayer, but all his heart was in
  it, and that is all that makes a prayer avail. And when at last,
  from sheer weariness, he sank down on to his heels in science,
  gazing earnestly out into the blackness of the night, his heart
  prayed on though his lips no longer moved.</p>

  <p>Could anything have happened to her? Could the black waters
  have swallowed her?</p>

  <p>Anything might have happened to her. The waters might have
  swallowed her, as they had Bernel.</p>

  <p>The thoughts would surge up behind his prayer, but he prayed
  them down&mdash;again and again&mdash;and clung to his prayer and
  his hope.</p>

  <p>It seemed hours since they parted, since his last glimpse of
  her as the black waters swallowed the slim white figure, and
  seemed to laugh scornfully at its smallness and weakness.</p>

  <p>"<i>Oh, Nance! Nance! God keep you! God keep you! God keep you!
  Dear one, God keep you! God keep you! God keep you, and bring you
  safe to land</i>!"</p>

  <p>He was numb with kneeling. If one had come behind him and cut
  off his feet above the ankles, he would have felt no pain. He
  felt no bodily sensation whatever. His body was there on the
  rock, but his heart was out upon the black waters alongside
  Nance, struggling with her through the belching coils, nerving
  her through the treacherous swirls. And his soul&mdash;all that
  was most really and truly him&mdash;was agonizing in prayer for
  her before the God to whom he had prayed at his mother's knee,
  and whom she had taught him to look to as a friend and helper in
  all times of need.</p>

  <p>He did not even stop&mdash;as he well might have done&mdash;to
  think that the friend sought only in time of need might have
  reasonable ground for complaint of neglect at other times.</p>

  <p>He thought of nothing but that Nance was out there battling
  with the black waters&mdash;that he could not lift a finger to
  help her&mdash;that all he could do was to pray for her safety
  with all his heart and soul.</p>

  <p>Then, after an age of this numb agony of waiting, a tiny bead
  of light flickered on the outer darkness, as though Hope with a
  golden pin-point had pricked the black curtain of despair, and
  let a gleam of her glory peep through. It swung to and fro, and
  he fell forward with his face in his ice-cold hands and sobbed,
  "Thank God! Thank God! She is safe! She is safe!"</p>

  <p>When he tried to get up, his legs gave way under him, and he
  had to sit and wait till they recovered. And when at last he got
  under way along the ridge, he stumbled like a drunken man.</p>

  <p>He tangled his feet in the blanket and fell in a heap. He
  wondered dimly where the cloak was&mdash;remembered Nance had
  worn it till she took to the sea&mdash;and stumbled off through
  the dark again to find it. Nance had worn it. To him it was
  sacred.</p>

  <p>When he got back with it, he wrapped it round him and crept
  into his shelter and slept like a dog.</p>

  XXVIII</h2>

  <h3>HOW THE OTHERS CAME TO MAKE AN END</h3>

  <p>He woke next morning with a start. The sun was high, by the
  shadow of his doorway; and by that same token the tide would be
  at half-ebb, if not lower, and the gates of his fortress at his
  enemy's mercy.</p>

  <p>He picked up his gun, listened anxiously for sound of him, and
  then crept cautiously out, with a quick glance along each
  slope.</p>

  <p>Nothing!&mdash;nothing but the cheerful sun and the cloudless
  sky, and the empty blue plain of the sea, and the birds circling
  and diving and squabbling as usual&mdash;and Nance's little
  parcel lying where she had dropped it. He had had other things to
  think about last night.</p>

  <p>The composure of the birds reassured him somewhat. Still, they
  might have landed on the other side of the rock and be lying in
  wait for him.</p>

  <p>He picked up Nance's parcel with a feeling of reverence. It
  might have cost her her life, in spite of her bladders. Then he
  climbed cautiously to the ridge and peered over.</p>

  <p>Sark lay basking in the sunshine, peaceful and placid, as if
  no son of hers had ever had an ill thought of his neighbour, much
  less sought his blood.</p>

  <p>Not a boat was in sight, and the birds on the north slope
  seemed as undisturbed as their fellows on the south.</p>

  <p>The invasion in force needed time perhaps to prepare and would
  be all the more conclusive when completed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, he would eat and watch at the same time, for he
  felt as empty as a drum, and an empty man is not in the pinkest
  of condition for a fight.</p>

  <p>Never in his life had he tasted bread so sweet!&mdash;and the
  strips of boiled bacon in between came surely from a most unusual
  pig&mdash;a porker of sorts, without a doubt, and of most
  extraordinary attainment in the nice balancing of lean and fat,
  and the induing of both with vital juices of the utmost strength
  and sweetness. Truly, a most celestial pig!&mdash;and he was very
  hungry.</p>

  <p>Had he been a pagan he would most likely have offered a
  portion of his slim rations as thank-offering to his gods, for
  they had come to him at risk of a girl's life. As it was, he ate
  them very thoughtfully to the very last crumb, and was
  grateful.</p>

  <p>They had been wrapped in a piece of white linen, and then tied
  tightly in oiled cloth, and were hardly damped with sea-water.
  The piece of linen and the oiled cloth and the bits of cord he
  folded up carefully and put inside his coat.</p>

  <p>They spoke of Nance. If they had drowned her she would have
  gone with them tied on to her head. He took them out again, and
  kissed them, and put them back.</p>

  <p>Thank God, she had got through safely! Thank God! Thank
  God!</p>

  <p>He shivered in the blaze of the sun as his eyes rested on the
  waves of the Race, bristling up against the run of the tide as
  usual, and he thought of what it might have meant to him this
  morning.</p>

  <p>It had swallowed Bernel. In spite of his hopeful words to
  Nance, he feared the brave lad was gone. And it might have
  swallowed Nance. And if it had&mdash;it might as well have him,
  too. For it was only thought of Nance that made life bearable to
  him.</p>

  <p>The sun wheeled his silvery dance along the waters; the day
  wore on;&mdash;and still no sign of the invaders. Sark looked as
  utterly deserted as it must have done in the lone days after the
  monks left it, when, for two hundred years, it was given over to
  the birds, till de Carteret and his merry men came across from
  Jersey and woke it up to life again.</p>

  <p>And then, of a sudden, his heart kicked within him as if it
  would climb into his throat and choke him; for, round the distant
  point of the L&acirc;ches, a boat had stolen out, and, as he
  watched it anxiously, there came another, and another, and
  another. They were coming!</p>

  <p>Four boat-loads! That ought to be enough to make full sure of
  him. He wondered why they had not come sooner, for the tide was
  on the rise, and the landing-places did not look tempting.</p>

  <p>His gun was under his hand, and his powder-flask and his
  little bag of shot. He had no more preparations to make, and he
  had no wish to fight.</p>

  <p>No wish? The thought of it was hateful to him, and yet it was
  not in human nature to give in without a struggle.</p>

  <p>But it should be all their doing. All he wanted was to be left
  in peace. Every man has the right to defend his own life.</p>

  <p>But then, again&mdash;there could be only one end to it, he
  knew. So why fight?</p>

  <p>They were coming to make an end of him. What good was it to
  make an end of any of them?</p>

  <p>Even if he should succeed in keeping them off this time, the
  end would come all the same, only it would be longer of coming.
  Why prolong it?</p>

  <p>The boats came bounding on like hounds at sight of the quarry.
  They were well filled, four or five men in each boat, besides the
  oarsmen. Enough, surely, to make an end of one lone man.</p>

  <p>Would they attempt to land in different places and rush him,
  he wondered. Or would they content themselves with lying off and
  attempting to shoot him down from a distance? The last would be
  the safest all round, both for them and for him&mdash;for,
  landing, they would, for the moment, be more or less at his
  mercy; and, snapping at him from a distance, he would have
  certain chances of cover in his favour.</p>

  <p>The top of the ridge was flattened in places, there were even
  depressions here and there, very slight, but quite enough to
  shelter any one lying prone in them from bombardment from
  sea-level. He chose the deepest he could find, and crawled into
  it, and lay, with his chin in his hands, watching the oncoming
  boats.</p>

  <p>If he could have managed it, he would have slipped down to the
  rock wall and crept into his burrow, but it was on that side the
  boats were coming, and the sharp eyes on board would inevitably
  see him, and so get on the track of his hiding-place.</p>

  <p>If the chance offered&mdash;if they left that end of the rock
  unspied upon for three minutes&mdash;he would try it.</p>

  <p>They parted at the Quette d'Amont, two going along the south
  side and two along the north. He could hear their voices, their
  rough jests and brief laughter, as they crept past.</p>

  <p>It was an odd sensation, this, of lying there like a hunted
  hare, knowing that it was him they were after.</p>

  <p>He pressed still closer to the rock, and did not dare to raise
  his head for a look. The voices and the sound of the oars died
  away, came again, died again, as the boats slowly circled the
  rock, every keen eye on board, he knew, searching every nook and
  cranny for sign of him.</p>

  <p>Then a shot rang out, over there towards the south-west, and
  another, and another. Tired of inaction, they were peppering his
  bee-hive to stir him up in case he was fast asleep inside.</p>

  <p>The other boats rowed swiftly round to the firing, and he
  could imagine them clustered there in a bunch, watching hopefully
  for him to come out; and his blood boiled and chilled again at
  thought of what might have been if he had been caught
  napping.</p>

  <p>And then, seizing his chance, he crawled to the opposite side
  of his hollow, peeped over, and saw the way clear. If only they
  would go on peppering the bee-hive for another minute or two, he
  would have time to slip down the Sark side of his rock and get to
  the great wall, and so down into his new hiding-place.</p>

  <p>If they tried to land, he could perhaps kill or wound two,
  three, half-a-dozen, at risk of his own life. But the end would
  be the same. With a dozen good shots coolly potting at him, he
  must go down in time, and he had no desire either to kill or to
  be killed.</p>

  <p>He wormed himself over the edge of his hollow and hurried
  along to the tumbled rocks, carrying his gun and
  powder-flask&mdash;not that he wanted them, but wanted still less
  to leave them behind. He scrambled over, found his marked rocks,
  and slipped safely under the overhanging slab. There he could
  peep out without danger of being seen; and he was barely under
  cover when the first boat came slowly round again, every bearded
  face intent on the rock, every eye searching for sign of him.</p>

  <p>The other boats passed, and as each one came it seemed to him
  that every eye on board looked straight up into his own, and he
  involuntarily shrank down into the shadow of the slab. They could
  not possibly see him, he was certain; and yet a thrill ran
  through him each time their searching glances crossed his
  own.</p>

  <p>The rough jests and laughter of the boats had given way now to
  angry growls at his invisibility. He could hear them cursing him
  as they passed, and even casting doubts on the veracity of his
  visitors of the previous night. And these latter upheld their
  statements with such torrents of red-hot patois that, if they had
  come to grips and fought the matter out, he would not have been
  in the least surprised.</p>

  <p>Then there came a long interval, when no boats came round.
  They had probably taken their courage in their hands and landed,
  and were searching the island. He dropped noiselessly into his
  well and clambered up into the tunnel, and lay there with only
  his head out.</p>

  <p>And, sure enough, before long he heard the sound of big
  sea-boots climbing heavily over the rock wall, and the voices of
  their owners as they passed.</p>

  <p>What would they do next, he wondered. Would they imagine him
  flown, as the result of their last night's visit? Or would they
  believe him still on the island and bound to come out of his
  hiding-place sooner or later? Would they give it up and go home?
  Or would they leave a guard to trap him when hunger and thirst
  brought him out?</p>

  <p>He lay patiently in the mouth of his tunnel till long after
  the last glimmer of light had faded from under the big slabs that
  covered in his well. More than once he heard voices, and once
  they came so close that he was sure they had come upon his
  tracks, and he crept some distance down his tunnel to be out of
  sight. But the alarm proved a false one, and the time passed very
  slowly.</p>

  <p>As he lay, he thought of the dead man with the bound hands and
  feet in the silent chamber behind him, bound by the forebears of
  these men, who, in turn, were seeking him, and would treat him as
  ruthlessly if they found him.</p>

  <p>He took the lesson to heart, and braced himself to patient
  endurance, though, indeed, he began to ask himself gloomily what
  was the use of it all. In the end, their venomous persistence
  must make an end of him. One man could not fight for ever against
  a whole community.</p>

  <p>And at that he chided himself. Not a whole community! For was
  not Nance on his side&mdash;hoping and praying and working for
  him with all her might and main? And her mother, and Grannie, and
  the Vicar, and the Doctor, and the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal? He was
  sure they all knew him far too well to doubt him. And all these
  and the Truth must surely prevail.</p>

  <p>But the long strain had been sore on him, and in spite of his
  anxieties he fell asleep in his hole, and dreamed that the dead
  man came crawling down the tunnel, and dragged him back into the
  chamber, and tied his hands and feet, and went away, and left him
  to die there all alone. And so strong was the impression upon him
  that, when he woke, he lay wondering who had loosed his bonds,
  and could not make out how he had got back into the mouth of the
  tunnel.</p>

  <p>It was still quite dark. He was stiff with lying in that
  cramped place. He was strongly tempted to climb out and see how
  matters lay. For he might be able to find out in the dark,
  whereas daylight would make him prisoner again.</p>

  <p>He wanted eggs, too. Nance's provision had served him well all
  day, but if he had to spend another day there something more
  would be welcome.</p>

  <p>But then it struck him that if he went up in the dark he might
  never be able to find his way back again. The cleft under the
  slab was difficult to hit upon even in daylight. There were
  scores of just similar ragged black holes among the tumbled rocks
  of the great wall.</p>

  <p>As he lay pondering it all, the grim idea came into his head
  of dragging the dead man through the tunnel, and hoisting him up
  outside, and leaving him propped up among the boulders where they
  would be sure to find him.</p>

  <p>He knew how arrantly superstitious they were, most of them.
  They had been brought up on ghosts and witches and evil spirits,
  and, fearless as they might be of things mortal and natural, all
  that bordered on the unknown and uncanny held for them
  unimaginable terrors. The dead man might serve a useful purpose
  after all; and the grim idea grew.</p>

  <p>He could decide nothing, however, till he learned if he had
  the rock to himself; and he determined to take the risk of
  finding this out.</p>

  <p>He cautiously climbed the well, and by the look of the stars
  he judged it still very early morning. A brooding grey darkness
  covered the sea; the sky was dark even in the east.</p>

  <p>He slipped off his coat and left it hanging out of the cleft
  as a landmark, and lowered himself silently from rock to rock,
  till he stood among the rank grasses below.</p>

  <p>Food first&mdash;so, after patient listening for smallest
  sound or sign of a watch, he crept down to the slope where the
  puffins' nests were, and, wrapping his hand in Nance's napkin,
  managed to get out a dozen eggs from as many different holes, in
  spite of the fierce objections of their legitimate owners.</p>

  <p>He tied these up carefully in the blood-spotted cloth, and
  carried them up to his cleft. Then he stole away like a shadow,
  to find out, if he could, if there was any one else on the rock
  besides himself and the dead man.</p>

  <p>There had been hot disputes on that head in the boats. Those
  who were there for the first time had even gone the length of
  casting strongest possible doubts as to whether those who were
  there the night before had seen or heard anything whatever, and
  did not hesitate to state their belief that they were all on a
  fool's errand. The others replied in kind, and when the further
  question was mooted as to keeping watch all night, the scoffers
  told the others to keep watch if they chose; for themselves, they
  were going home to their beds.</p>

  <p>"Frightened of ghosts, I s'pose," growled one.</p>

  <p>"No more than yourself, John Drillot. But we've wasted a day
  on this same fooling, and the man's not here; and for me, I doubt
  if he's ever been here."</p>

  <p>"And what of the things we found in the shelter?" said
  Drillot. "Think they came there of themselves?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care how they came there. It's not old cloaks and
  blankets we came after. Maybe he has been here. I don't know. But
  he's not here now, and I've had enough of it."</p>

  <p>"B'en! I'm not afraid to stop all night&mdash;if anyone'll
  stop with me"&mdash;and if no one had offered he would have been
  just as well pleased. "Don't know as I'd care to stop all
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Frightened of ghosts, maybe," scoffed the other.</p>

  <p>"You stop with me, Tom Guille, and we'll see which is
  frightenedest of ghosts, you or me."</p>

  <p>But Tom Guille believed in ghosts as devoutly as any old woman
  in Sark, and he was bound for home, no matter what the rest chose
  to do.</p>

  <p>"There's not a foot of the rock we haven't searched," said he,
  "and the man's not here; so what's the use of waiting all
  night?"</p>

  <p>"Because if he's in hiding it's at night he'll come out."</p>

  <p>"Come out of where?"</p>

  <p>"Wherever he's got to."</p>

  <p>"That's Guernsey, most likely. His friends have arranged to
  lift him off here first chance that came; and it came before we
  did, and you'll not see him in these parts again, I warrant
  you."</p>

  <p>"I'll wait with you, John, if you're set on it, though I doubt
  Tom's right, and the man's gone," said Peter Vaudin of La Ville.
  And John Drillot found himself bound to the adventure.</p>

  <p>"Do we keep the boat?" asked Vaudin.</p>

  <p>"No ... for then one of us must sit in her all night, or she
  will bump herself to pieces. You will come back for us in the
  morning, Philip."</p>

  <p>"I'll come," said Philip Guille, and presently they stood
  watching the boats pulling lustily homewards, and devoutly
  wishing they were in them.</p>

  <p>Every foot of the rock, as they knew it, had already been
  carefully raked over. The possible hiding-places were few. But no
  one knows better than a Sark man what rocks can do in the way of
  slits and tunnels and caves, and it was just this possibility
  that had set John Drillot to his unwonted, and none too welcome,
  task. The murderer&mdash;as he deemed Gard&mdash;might have found
  some place unknown to any of them, and might be lying quietly
  waiting for them to go. If that was so, he must come out sooner
  or later, and the chances were that he would steal out in the
  night.</p>

  <p>So the two watchers prowled desultorily about the rock, poking
  again into every place that suggested possible concealment for
  anything larger than a puffin. There might be openings in the
  rifted basement rocks which only the full ebb would discover, and
  these might lead up into chambers where a man could lie high and
  dry till the tide allowed him out again. And so they hung
  precariously over the waves and poked and peered, and found
  nothing.</p>

  <p>They had clambered over the great wall more than once before
  Vaudin said: "G'zamin, John, I wonder if there's any holes here
  big enough to take a man?"</p>

  <p>"He'd have to be a little one, and this Gard's not that," and
  they stood looking at the wall. "'Sides, them rocks lie on the
  rock itself, and there's no depth to them."</p>

  <p>But Vaudin was not sure that there might not be room for a man
  to lie flat under some of the big slabs, and began to poke about
  among them.</p>

  <p>"Some one's been up here," he said, pointing to one of Gard's
  own scorings.</p>

  <p>"Bin up there four times myself," said Drillot, "an' so have
  all the rest. There's no room to hide a man there, Peter. If he's
  hid anywhere, he'll come out in the night. Maybe Philip Guille's
  right, and he's safe in Guernsey by this. Come along to that
  shelter and let's have a drink."</p>

  <p>They had their bottle out of the boat, and they had also come
  upon Gard's bottle of cognac, of which quite half remained. It
  was a finer cordial than their own, so they sat drinking them
  turn about, and watching the sun set, and chatting spasmodically,
  till it grew too dark to do more than sit still with safety.</p>

  <p>They were by no means drunk, but the spirits had made them
  heavy, and when John Drillot solemnly suggested that they should
  keep watch about, Peter Vaudin as solemnly agreed, and offered to
  take first duty.</p>

  <p>So John curled his length inside the bee-hive, and made
  himself comfortable with Gard's cloak and blanket, and was
  presently snoring like a whole pig-sty. And that had a soporific
  effect on Peter. He had only stopped behind to oblige John, and
  personally had little expectation of anything coming of it.
  Moreover, the night air was chilly. If he could get that cloak
  from John now! He crawled in to try, but big John was rolled up
  like a caterpillar. It was warmer inside there than out, anyway.
  And he could keep watch there just as well as outside; so he
  propped himself up alongside John, and braced his mind to sentry
  duty.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER
  XXIX</h2>

  <h3>HOW HE CAME INTO AN UNKNOWN PLACE</h3>

  <p>Having lodged his eggs in a ledge under the big slab, Gard
  stole away to learn, if he could, if he had the rock all to
  himself.</p>

  <p>He wanted water, and he wanted his bottle of cognac and the
  tin dipper; for puffins' eggs, while not unpalatable beaten up
  with cognac, are of a flavour calculated to exercise the
  strongest stomach when eaten raw.</p>

  <p>He feared the men would have made away with all his small
  possessions, but he could only try. So he stole like a shadow
  round the crown of the ridge and along towards the shelter,
  standing at times motionless for whole minutes till the rush of
  the waves below should pass and give him chance of hearing.</p>

  <p>But on L'Etat the sound of many waters never ceases night or
  day, and the night wind hummed among the stones of the shelter,
  and, as it happened, John Drillot had just lurched over in
  avoidance of a lump of rock which was intruding on his comfort,
  and in so doing had lodged his heavy boot in Peter Vaudin's ribs,
  and so their sonorous duet was stilled, and neither of them was
  very sound asleep, when Gard, after listening anxiously and
  hearing nothing, dropped on his hands and knees and felt
  cautiously inside.</p>

  <p>Peter felt the blind hand groping in the dark, and was wide
  awake in an instant. He hurled himself at the intruder, as well
  as a man could who had been lying back against the wall half
  asleep a moment before; and Gard turned and sped away along the
  side of the ridge, with Peter at his heels and John Drillot
  thundering ponderously in the rear.</p>

  <p>"What is't, Peter boy?" shouted John.</p>

  <p>"It's him. This way!" yelled Peter, out of the dimness in
  front, as he stumbled and staggered along the ragged inadequacies
  of the ridge.</p>

  <p>If Gard had had time for consideration, he would have led them
  a chase elsewhere first, but, in the sudden upsetting of lighting
  on what he had persuaded himself was not there, he lost his head
  and made straight for cover.</p>

  <p>Peter Vaudin was at the base of the rock wall as he wriggled
  silently under the big slab, and it was only by a violent jerk
  that he got his foot clear of Peter's grip. And Peter, strung to
  the occasion, kept his hand on the spot where the foot had
  disappeared, and waited a moment for John Drillot to come up
  before he followed it.</p>

  <p>"Gone in here," he jerked, as he climbed cautiously up.</p>

  <p>"Can't have gone far, then," panted John. "Sure it was
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Had him by the foot, but he got loose. Here we are," as he
  poked about, and came at last on the hole below the slab. "Come
  on, John ... can't be far away.... Big hole"&mdash;as he kicked
  about down below&mdash;"no bottom, far as I can see."</p>

  <p>"Best wait for daylight, to see where we're getting."</p>

  <p>"Oui gia! Man doux, it's not me's going down here till I know
  what's below."</p>

  <p>So they sat and kicked their heels and waited for the day,
  certain in their own minds that their quarry was run to earth and
  as good as caught.</p>

  <p>Gard had swept down both his coat and his cloth full of eggs
  in his sudden entrance. He stood at the bottom of the well to see
  if they would follow, while Peter's long legs kicked about for
  foothold. He heard them decide to wait for daylight, and then he
  noiselessly picked up his coat and his soppy bundle of broken
  eggs, pushed them into the tunnel, and crawled in after them.</p>

  <p>He was trapped, indeed, but he doubted very much if any
  fisherman on Sark would venture down that tunnel. They were
  brawny men, used to leg and elbow room, and, as a rule, heartily
  detested anything in the shape of underground adventure. They
  might, of course, get over some miners to explore for them. Or
  they might content themselves with sitting down on top of his
  hole until he was starved out. In any case, his rope was nearly
  run; but yet he was not disposed to shorten it by so much as an
  inch.</p>

  <p>As he wormed his way along the tunnel, the recollection of
  those other openings off the dead man's cave came back to him. He
  would try them. He pushed on with a spurt of hope.</p>

  <p>The tunnel was not nearly so long now that he knew where he
  was going; in fact, now that nothing but it stood between him and
  capture, it seemed woefully inadequate.</p>

  <p>When his head and elbows no longer grazed rock he dropped his
  coat and crawled into the chamber. He felt his way round to the
  dried packages, and cautiously emptied half-a-dozen and prepared
  them for his use.</p>

  <p>This set him sneezing so violently that it seemed impossible
  that the watchers outside should not hear him. It also gave him
  an idea.</p>

  <p>He struck a light and kindled one of his torches, and the dead
  man leaped out of the darkness at him as before. That gave him
  another idea.</p>

  <p>Propping up his light on the floor, he emptied package after
  package of the powdered tobacco into the tunnel, and wafted it
  down towards the entrance with his jacket. Then with his knife he
  cut the lashings from the dead man's hands and feet, and carried
  him across&mdash;he was very light, for all his substance had
  long since withered out of him&mdash;and laid him in the tunnel
  as though he was making his way out.</p>

  <p>If he knew anything of Sark men and miners, he felt fairly
  secure for some time to come, so he sat himself down, as far as
  possible from the snuff, and made such a meal as was possible off
  puffins' eggs, mixed good and bad and unredeemed by any
  palliating odour and flavour. They were not appetising, but they
  stayed his stomach for the time being.</p>

  <p>It was only then that he remembered that he had left his gun
  and powder-flask behind him. He had placed them on a ledge just
  inside the mouth of the tunnel, and in his haste had forgotten to
  pick them up. He had no intention of using them, however, and he
  would not go back for them.</p>

  <p>When his scanty meal was done, he cautiously emptied a number
  of the packages and rolled them into torches, and deliberated as
  to which of the black openings he should attempt first.</p>

  <p>That one opposite, out of which the dead man's legs sprawled
  grotesquely, was the one by which he had entered. This one, then,
  near which he sat, must run on towards the centre of the
  island&mdash;if it ran on at all; and, since all were equally
  unknown and hopeful, he would try this first.</p>

  <p>His tarred paper torches, though they burned with a clear
  flame, gave forth a somewhat pungent odour, so he kicked one of
  the small barrels to pieces, and with three of the staves and a
  piece of string made a holder which would carry the torch
  upright, and also permit him to lay it on the ground or push it
  in front of him, if need be.</p>

  <p>The first tunnel ran in about thirty feet, and then the slant
  of the roof met the floor at so sharp an angle that further
  passage was impossible.</p>

  <p>The second, third, and fourth the same; and he began to fear
  they were all blind alleys leading nowhere.</p>

  <p>The openings near his own entrance tunnel he had left till the
  last, since they obviously led outwards.</p>

  <p>Two of them shut down in the same way as all the others, and
  it was only the dogged determination to leave no chance untried
  that drove him, with a fresh supply of torches, down the last one
  of all, the one alongside that out of which the dead man's legs
  projected.</p>

  <p>It took a turn to the left within a dozen feet of the
  entrance, and, like the rest, it presently narrowed down through
  a slope in the roof; but just at its narrowest, when he feared he
  had come to the end, there came a dip in the flooring
  corresponding to the slope up above, and he found he could
  wriggle through. Once through, the passage widened and continued
  to widen, and the going became very rough and broken, with piles
  of ragged rock and deep black pitfalls in between.</p>

  <p>Then, of a sudden, he saw the walls and roof of his passage
  fall away, and his light flickered feebly in the darkness of a
  vast place, and he crouched on the rock up which he had climbed,
  and sat in wonder.</p>

  <p>Somewhere below him he could hear the slow rise and fall of
  water, dull and heavy and without any splash, like the dumb
  breathing of a captive monster.</p>

  <p>And every now and again there came, from somewhere beyond, a
  low dull thud, like the blow of a padded hammer, and a distant
  subdued rustle along the outside of the darkness. He knew it was
  not inside the place he was in, for he could hear the soft rise
  and fall of the water quite clearly, but these other sounds came
  to him from a distance, muted as though his ears had suddenly
  gone deaf.</p>

  <p>"Those dull blows," he said to himself, "are the waves on the
  outside of L'Etat. That low rustling is the rush of them along
  the lower rocks. The water inside here probably comes in through
  some openings below tide-level. I am quite safe here, even if
  they get past the dead man's cave&mdash;quite safe until I
  starve. Unless there are fish to be had"&mdash;and he felt a
  spark of hope. "And maybe there are devil-fish"&mdash;and he
  shivered and glanced below and about him fearfully.</p>

  <p>His homely torch did no more than faintly illumine the rock he
  sat on and those close at hand, and cast a gigantic uncouth
  shadow of himself on the rough wall behind. All beyond was solid
  darkness, blacker even than a black Sark night.</p>

  <p>He sat wondering vaguely if any before him had penetrated to
  that strange place. It was odd and uncanny to feel that his eyes
  were the very first to look upon it. And then, away in front, and
  apparently at a great distance above him, he became aware of a
  difference in the solid darkness. It seemed almost as though it
  had thinned. His eye had seemed able for a moment to carry beyond
  the narrow circle of the torch, but when he peered into the void
  to see what this might mean, it all seemed solid as before.</p>

  <p>As his straining eyes sought relief in something visible,
  their side-glance caught once more that same impression of
  movement in the darkness. And presently it came again and
  stronger&mdash;a strange greenish fluttering up in the
  roof&mdash;very faint, as though the roof were smoke on which a
  soft green light played for a moment and vanished.</p>

  <p>But by degrees the light grew, though at no time did it become
  more than a wan ghost of a light, and from its curious fluttering
  he judged that it came through water.</p>

  <p>Reasoning from the trend of the cavern, he came to the
  conclusion that somewhere on that further side there were
  openings into the deep water beyond, on which the sunlight played
  and struck at times into the cave, and he was keen to look more
  closely into it.</p>

  <p>He lowered his torch to the side of his rock, and its feeble
  flicker fell on a chaos of rocks below. He looked long and
  cautiously for supple yellow arms or tiny whip-like threads which
  might coil suddenly round his legs and drag him to hideous
  death.</p>

  <p>But he saw nothing of the kind. The rocks were dry and bare,
  not a limpet nor a sea-weed visible, and leaving his jacket for a
  landmark as before, he slowly let himself down from one huge
  boulder to another, till he found himself climbing another great
  pile in front.</p>

  <p>When at last his head rose above this ridge, he almost rolled
  over at the sight of two huge green eyes blinking lazily at him
  out of the darkness in front&mdash;two great openings far below
  sea-level, through which filtered dimly the wavering green light
  whose refractions fluttered in the roof.</p>

  <p>The vast trough below him heaved gently now and then, with a
  ponderous solemnity which filled him with awe. He felt himself an
  intruder. He felt like a fly creeping about a sleeping tiger. He
  hardly dared to breathe, lest the brooding spirit of the place
  should rise suddenly out of some dark corner and squash him on
  his rock as one does a crawling insect; and his anxious eyes
  swept to and fro for the smallest sign of danger.</p>

  <p>But, plucking up courage from immunity, and dreading to be
  caught in the dark in that weird place, he crawled over the
  boulders towards the side wall of the cavern to get as near to
  those openings as possible. From the very slight movement of the
  water, which was ever on the boil round the outside of L'Etat, he
  judged them deep down among the roots of the island, far below
  the turmoil of the surface, but he must see and make sure.</p>

  <p>With infinite toil and many a scrape and bruise, he got round
  at last, and could look right down into the dim green depths, and
  what he saw there filled him with sickening fear.</p>

  <p>The water was crystal clear, and in through the nearer
  opening, as he looked, a huge octopus propelled itself in
  leisurely fashion, its great tentacles streaming out behind, its
  hideous protruding eyes searching eagerly for prey.</p>

  <p>Just inside the opening it gathered itself together for a
  moment, and seemed to look so meaningly right up into his eyes
  that he found himself shrinking behind a rock lest it should see
  him. Then it clamped itself to the side of the opening and spread
  wide its arms for anything that might come its way.</p>

  <p>He watched it, fascinated. He saw fishes large and small
  unconsciously touch the quivering tentacles, which on the instant
  twisted round them and dragged them in to the rending beak below
  the hideous eyes. And then he saw another similar monster come
  floating in on similar quest, and in a moment they were locked in
  deadly fight&mdash;such a writhing and coiling and straining and
  twisting of monstrous fleshy limbs, which swelled and thrilled,
  and loosed and gripped, with venom past believing&mdash;such a
  clamping to this rock and that&mdash;such tremendous efforts at
  dislodgment.</p>

  <p>It was a nightmare. It sickened him. He turned and crawled
  feebly away, anxious only now to get out of this awful place
  without falling foul of any similar monsters among the rocks.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

  <h3>HOW NANCE WATCHED FROM AFAR</h3>

  <p>From the headland above Breni&egrave;re, Nance had watched the
  boats go plunging across to L'Etat.</p>

  <p>Very early that morning she had sped across the Coup&eacute;e
  and up the long roads to the Seigneurie, but the Seigneur was
  away in Guernsey still, busied on the vital matter of raising
  still more money for the mines in which he was a firm believer,
  mortgaging his Seigneurie for the purpose, assured in his own
  mind that all would be well in the end.</p>

  <p>Then to the Vicar and the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, and these
  set off at once for the harbour, but found themselves powerless
  in the face of public opinion. Argument and remonstrance alike
  fell on deaf ears. The Vicar appealed to their sense of right;
  the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal forbade their going. But their minds
  were doggedly set on it, and they went.</p>

  <p>"I shall hold you to account," stormed Philip Guille.</p>

  <p>"B'en, M. le S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, we'll pay it all among
  us," and away they went; and back to her look-out by
  Breni&egrave;re went Nance, and the Vicar with her for comfort in
  this dark hour.</p>

  <p>They watched the boats circling the rock, round and round.
  They heard the firing, and Nance flung herself on the ground in
  an agony of weeping, sure that the end had come. For they could
  only be firing at Gard, and what could one man do against so
  many?</p>

  <p>"They have killed him," she moaned.</p>

  <p>And the Vicar could only tighten his pale lips, and smooth her
  hair with his thin white hand, as she writhed on the ground at
  his side. For he could but think she was right. They were good
  shots, the Sark men, and it needs but one bullet to kill a
  man.</p>

  <p>If Nance had looked a moment longer she might have seen Gard
  slip down from the ridge to the wall, but the bombardment of the
  shelter, which gave him his chance, made an end of her hopes, and
  her face was hidden in the turf.</p>

  <p>The Vicar's sight was not keen enough to see clearly what was
  passing. But when the men landed on the rock, and overran it in
  their search, he could not fail to see their figures on the ridge
  against the sky, and an exclamation of surprise roused Nance.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she jerked.</p>

  <p>"They have landed over there. They seem to be searching the
  rock."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;" and she sat up suddenly and gazed intently
  across at L'Etat, and then sprang to her feet, a new creature.
  "For, see you, Mr Cachemaille," she cried, "if they had killed
  him they would not be searching for him, nenni-gia!"</p>

  <p>"That is true, child," said the Vicar hopefully, and then,
  less hopefully, "but where shall a man hide on L'Etat?"</p>

  <p>"Ah now! I remember. Just as I was leaving him last night, he
  told me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As you were leaving him&mdash;last night?" and the old man
  gazed at her as though he doubted his ears or her right
  senses.</p>

  <p>"But yes," she cried impatiently. "I swam across there last
  night to see if Bernel was there and to take him some food. But
  you are not to tell that to any one. And he told me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You swam across?&mdash;to L'Etat?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! We have done it many times, and, besides, I had the
  bladders&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Vicar shook his head helplessly. She forgot to explain so
  much that he did not understand. But he grasped at one
  thread.</p>

  <p>"And Bernel?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, my poor Bernel! He is drowned," she said, with a heave of
  the breast, but with her eyes intent on L'Etat. "I wanted him to
  take the bladders, but he would not; and it was the first night
  after the storm, you see, and the waves were big still, and he
  never got to L'Etat, and he never came back; so, you
  see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Truly, you are being sorely tried, my child. But your brother
  was a better swimmer than most. May we not hope&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she shook her head, intent on the doings on the rock, and
  full, for the moment, of the hope she could draw from Gard's hint
  about a hiding-place of which she knew nothing. For if she and
  Bernel had never discovered it, how should these others? And
  obviously they were searching, for they prowled about the rock
  like ants, and poked here and there, and wandered on and came
  back. And if they still sought they had not yet found; and so
  there was a new spring of hope in her heart.</p>

  <p>"Yes, truly, they are searching," she murmured, and forgot the
  Vicar and all else.</p>

  <p>He tried to induce her to go back home with him, but she would
  not move. For the moment all her hope in life was in peril on the
  rock, and she must see all that went on; and finally he had to
  leave her there, and she hardly knew that he had gone. She wanted
  only to be left alone, to nurse her new-born hope and watch in
  fear and trembling for any symptom of its overthrow.</p>

  <p>But she was not to be left in peace, for Madame Julie had
  heard the firing also, and had come round the headland by the
  miners' cottages, exulting in the fact that her enemy was run to
  earth at last and was meeting righteous punishment.</p>

  <p>And as she prowled about there, chafing at the delay in the
  return of the boats, she came suddenly on Nance gazing out at
  L'Etat with a face&mdash;not, as Julie would have expected,
  downcast and woe-begone, but full of eager expectancy. And the
  sight of her, and in such case, stirred Julie to venom.</p>

  <p>"Ah then&mdash;there you are, mademoiselle, listening to the
  end of your fancy gentleman! And the right end, too, ma foi! A
  man that goes knocking his neighbours on the head&mdash;it's
  right he should be shot like a rabbit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nance's face quivered, but she did not even look round.</p>

  <p>"You'll see them coming back presently, and they'll bring his
  body back with them in the boat, all full of holes. And then I'll
  feel that my Tom's paid for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you hear?" she cried, planting herself in front of Nance,
  and jerking her hands up and down in her excitement and the
  exaspeiation of receiving no response. "Do you hear me&mdash;you?
  Or are you gone crazy for love of your murderer?"&mdash;and she
  made as though to lay wild hands on the girl.</p>

  <p>"You are wicked! You are evil! You are a devil!" said Nance
  through her little white teeth, and looked so as though she might
  fly at her that Julie drew off.</p>

  <p>"Aha&mdash;spitfire!&mdash;wildcat!&mdash;you would bite?"</p>

  <p>Nance, all ashake with disgust, stooped suddenly and picked up
  a lump of rock.</p>

  <p>"Go!" she said, in a voice of such concentrated fury that it
  was little more than a whisper. "Go!&mdash;before I do you ill;"
  and she looked so like it that Julie turned and fled, expecting
  the rock between her shoulders at every step.</p>

  <p>But the rock was on the ground, and Nance was intent again on
  L'Etat.</p>

  <p>She stood there watching, until she saw the boats put off, and
  then she turned and sped like a rabbit&mdash;across the waste
  lands&mdash;across the Coup&eacute;e&mdash;over Clos Bourel
  fields into Dixcart&mdash;over Hog's Back to the Creux.</p>

  <p>She ran through the tunnel just as the boats came up, and her
  eyes were wide with expectant fear, as they swept them
  hungrily.</p>

  <p>"What have you done then, out there, Philip Vaudin?" she
  cried, as his boat's nose grated on the shingle.</p>

  <p>"Pardi, ma garche, we have done nothing."</p>

  <p>"But the shooting?"</p>

  <p>"Some one shot at the shelter to see if he was inside, and the
  rest shot because they thought there must be something to shoot
  at."</p>

  <p>"And you have not got him?" asked another disappointedly.</p>

  <p>"Never even seen him."</p>

  <p>"Ah ba!"</p>

  <p>"Either he's gone or he's under cover, though, ma f&eacute;, I
  don't know where he'd find it on L'Etat," and Nance's heart beat
  hopefully. "However, John Drillot and Peter Vaudin are stopping
  the night in case he is still there and ventures out of his
  hole," and her heart sank again, and kicked rebelliously that a
  man should be hunted thus, like a rabbit.</p>

  <p>She spent a night of misery, wondering what was happening on
  L'Etat, and was at her post above Breni&egrave;re as soon as it
  was light.</p>

  <p>She saw Philip Vaudin come round from the Creux in his boat
  and run across to the rock, and almost as soon as he had
  disappeared round Quette d'Amont, he came speeding back, alone,
  and not to the harbour, but straight to the fishermen's rough
  landing-place inside Breni&egrave;re.</p>

  <p>"What is it then, Philip?" she asked anxiously, as he hauled
  himself up the rocks on to the turf.</p>

  <p>"I've come for two miners," he panted, for he had come
  quickly. "They've run him to earth in a hole, but they won't
  either of them go in after him, and they want some one who
  will."</p>

  <p>"Ah, then!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He came out in the night, and they chased him, but he
  got into his hole, and they're sitting on it ever since," and he
  hurried away through the waste of gorse and bracken to the
  miners' cottages.</p>

  <p>Volunteers were evidently not over plentiful. It was a
  considerable time before he came back with a Welshman, Evan
  Morgan, and a young Cornishman, John Trevna, and neither of them
  seemed over eager for the job.</p>

  <p>"For, see you," had been Morgan's view, "coing in a hole after
  a man what hass a gun iss not a nice pissness, no inteet!" and
  the Cornishman agreed with him.</p>

  <p>However, they put off, and Nance crouched in the bracken and
  watched all their doings.</p>

  <p>She had long since caught sight of John Drillot and Peter
  Vaudin sitting on the rock wall, and wondered what kind of a
  hiding-place Gard could possibly have found therein. A poor one,
  she feared, and that the end would be quick.</p>

  <p>The boat disappeared round the corner, and presently she saw
  the three men join the others at the wall, and they all clustered
  there and talked, and then one by one they disappeared into the
  wall itself, and she sat watching in fear and trembling.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER
  XXXI</h2>

  <h3>HOW TWO WENT IN AND THREE CAME OUT</h3>

  <p>"It iss better to sit here two, three days till he comse out
  than to go in and get yourself killt, yes inteet!" was the burden
  of Evan Morgan's answer to all their arguments for a speedy
  assault. And "Iss, sure!" was Trevna's curt, complete
  endorsement.</p>

  <p>But when, at John Drillot's suggestion, they had squeezed
  under the slab to have a look at what lay below, and had peered
  down the slit that Gard tried first, and had then lighted on the
  tunnel, and had found the gun and powder-flask jammed in a
  crevice&mdash;that put a different face on the matter.</p>

  <p>And, after prolonged discussion as to the proper method of
  procedure, especially in the matter of precedence, it was at last
  arranged that Evan Morgan should go first with his miner's lamp,
  and that John Trevna should follow close behind, carrying the
  gun.</p>

  <p>"And iss it understood that I shoot him if I see him?" asked
  Trevna, to make sure of his ground and make his conscience
  easy.</p>

  <p>"Pardi, yes, mon gars! Shoot straight, and the Island will
  thank you," asserted John Drillot.</p>

  <p>"Ant for Heaven's sake, John Trevna, see you ton't shoot me
  behint by mistake," urged Evan Morgan; and they disappeared
  slowly into the tunnel, while the other two stood waiting
  expectantly in the well.</p>

  <p>Accustomed as they were to narrow places, this long worm-hole
  of a tunnel, with the doubtful possibilities that lay beyond it,
  seemed as endless to the militant members of the expedition as it
  did to the waiters outside.</p>

  <p>Occasionally a hollow sound came booming down the tunnel, when
  one or other grunted out a word of objurgation on the narrowness
  of things, but for the most part they wormed along in silence,
  Morgan shifting forward his lamp, foot by foot, and straining his
  eyes into the darkness ahead, Trevna close behind with his gun at
  full cock and ready for instant action.</p>

  <p>"Gad'rabotin, but they take their time, those two!" said John
  Drillot, impatiently, outside.</p>

  <p>"It iss going right through to Wailee, I do think," growled
  Evan Morgan inside.</p>

  <p>And it was just after that that there broke out in the depths
  of the tunnel a commotion so extraordinary that the listeners
  outside could make nothing at all of it, and could only lurch
  about in amazement and climb up and push their heads into the
  tunnel, and wonder what it all meant. Then, in the midst of the
  turmoil, there came the thunderous bellow of the gun, and after a
  time a trickle of thin blue smoke floated lazily out and hung
  about the well; and the men outside sniffed appreciatively, and
  said, "Ch'est b'en!" and waited hopefully.</p>

  <p>Evan Morgan, shifting forward his light, got an impression of
  something in the narrow way in front, and suddenly he was taken
  with the biggest fit of sneezing he had ever had in his life. He
  banged down the lamp and threw up his head till it cracked
  against the roof, then banged his chin against the floor, and
  finally propped himself, like a sick dog, on his two front paws,
  and sneezed and sneezed and sneezed for dear life.</p>

  <p>Then John Trevna began. He had the sense to lay down his gun,
  or Morgan might have got the charge in his back. And so they
  sneezed in concert, until their heads were clearer than they had
  been for many a day. And the sound of it all to those outside was
  like the sound of mortal combat.</p>

  <p>Then Morgan, wiping his streaming eyes on the sleeve of his
  coat, in a state of extreme exhaustion, caught sight of that
  which lay just beyond him, and he saw that it was a man crawling
  down the tunnel to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Shoot, John, shoot! He iss here," he yelled, and laid himself
  flat to give Trevna his chance.</p>

  <p>And Trevna, between two sneezes, picked up his gun, though he
  could see nothing to shoot at, and ran the barrel forward above
  Morgan's head and fired, and the roar of it in that confined
  space came near to deafening them both.</p>

  <p>The smoke hung thick and choked them, as they gasped it in in
  gulps while they sneezed, and the light had gone out with the
  concussion.</p>

  <p>They lay for a time exhausted. Then the atmosphere cleared
  somewhat, and they lay in the thick darkness straining their ears
  for any sound, but heard nothing.</p>

  <p>"What did you see, Evan Morgan?" whispered Trevna at last.</p>

  <p>"It wass a man."</p>

  <p>"Then I have killed him, for he does not move. Can you light
  the lamp?"</p>

  <p>"I can not&mdash;in here. I am coing out. I haf hat enough of
  this."</p>

  <p>"We must take him out, too."</p>

  <p>"You can tek him, then, John Trevna. I haf hat enough of him
  and this hole."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Evan Morgan. If it wass a man, and he got
  that load in him as close as that, he iss deader than Tom
  Hamon."</p>

  <p>"Well, you can go an' see. I am coing out," and he began to
  wriggle backwards, and Trevna was fain to go too.</p>

  <p>But presently they came to one of the somewhat wider places
  where the wall had fallen away, and Trevna squeezed himself
  tightly into this.</p>

  <p>"You go on, then, Evan Morgan," he said, "if you can get past,
  and I will go back and bring him out."</p>

  <p>"You are a fool, John Trevna, to meddle with him any more. Iff
  the man iss dead, he iss just as well left there."</p>

  <p>"If he iss dead he cannot harm me, and I would like to see the
  man I have killed."</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" grunted Morgan, and crawled on, legs first.</p>

  <p>Trevna wormed along up the tunnel, groping cautiously in front
  of him at each forward lurch, and at last his hands fell on what
  he sought, and at the same moment he began sneezing again.</p>

  <p>It would be no easy job dragging a dead man all down that
  tunnel, he thought. But when, after cautious feeling here and
  there, he got a grip of the man's coat collar, to his surprise it
  came away in his hand, but at the same time it seemed to him that
  the body was extraordinarily light.</p>

  <p>He tried again with a fresh grip on the coat, but it tore like
  paper, and, after thinking it over, he unstrapped his leather
  belt and got it round the man below the armpits, and so was able
  to haul him slowly along.</p>

  <p>When Evan Morgan's wriggling legs came slowly out of the
  tunnel, John Drillot and Peter Vaudin were almost dancing with
  excitement, and their first surprise was the sight of him when,
  by rights, John Trevna should have been the one to come out
  first.</p>

  <p>"Well then? What have you done? And where is John Trevna?"
  cried John Drillot.</p>

  <p>"Ach! He iss a fool. He hass shot the man and now he will
  pring him out when he woult pe much petter buried where he
  iss."</p>

  <p>"He's quite right. What was all the noise about?"</p>

  <p>"That wass the shooting."</p>

  <p>"Before that. You all seemed to be howling at once."</p>

  <p>"That wass the sneezing. It iss full of sneezing down there,"
  and his red eyes still showed the effect of it.</p>

  <p>It was a long time before they heard the laboured sounds of
  Trevna's coming. But at last his legs wriggled out, then his
  body, then with a lurch he hauled up to the mouth of the tunnel
  that which he had brought with him. And at sight of it they all
  started back against the sides of the well, with various cries
  but equal amazement.</p>

  <p>"O mon Gyu!" cried Peter Vaudin.</p>

  <p>"Thousand devils!" cried John Drillot.</p>

  <p>"Heavens an' earth!" gasped Evan Morgan.</p>

  <p>John Trevna gazed open-mouthed, for he had little breath left
  in him.</p>

  <p>And from the black mouth of the tunnel the strange and
  terrible figure of the dead man looked quietly down at them and
  filled them with amazement.</p>

  <p>Trevna's heavy charge had blown in the top of the skull. The
  shrunken yellow face wore the gaunt eager look of one who had
  died the slow death of starvation. It seemed to be trying to get
  at them to bite and rend them.</p>

  <p>Peter Vaudin was the first to climb the wall behind him, but
  the rest were close at his heels, and hustled him up through the
  crack under the slab.</p>

  <p>Peter struck down towards the landing-place the moment he had
  wriggled through.</p>

  <p>"Stop then, Peter," called John Drillot, in a low insistent
  voice, lest that dreadful thing below should hear him.</p>

  <p>"Not me! I've had enough, John Drillot. That is not what we
  came for ... and I had hold of its leg last night," and he
  shivered at the recollection, and the thought that it might have
  turned on him and gripped him with its grisly hands.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what it is," began John Drillot,
  "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's the man I shot inside there," said Trevna.</p>

  <p>"That man hass peen det a hundert years," said Morgan.</p>

  <p>"All the same, he was running about last night," said Peter,
  "and I had hold of his leg"&mdash;with another shiver.</p>

  <p>"He's dead enough now, anyway," said Drillot.</p>

  <p>"Eh b'en! leave him where he is, and let's get away. I've
  heard say there were ghosts on L'Etat, and now I know it. No good
  comes of meddling with these things."</p>

  <p>"But we ought to take him with us."</p>

  <p>"Take him with us!" almost shrieked Peter. "And let him loose
  on Sark! Why then?"</p>

  <p>"Whatever he was last night, he's dead enough now.... Will you
  help me to get him up, John Trevna?"</p>

  <p>"Iss, sure! He's got my belt."</p>

  <p>"Not in my boat, John Drillot," cried Peter. "Not in my boat.
  I've had enough of him, pardi!" and he set off at speed for the
  boat.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Peter. You, Evan Morgan, run down and stop
  him going. Come on, John Trevna," and after peering cautiously
  down to make sure the dead man had not moved, they dropped into
  the well again.</p>

  <p>The shrivelled figure was very light, as Trevna had found. It
  was only their repugnance at handling it that made their task a
  heavy one. One above and one below, they managed at last to get
  it up above ground, and then John Trevna slipped his belt to its
  middle, and carried it with one hand down the slope to the
  boat.</p>

  <p>There they found Evan Morgan holding the approach to the
  landing-place against Peter, with a lump of rock, while Philip,
  in the boat below, stood shouting at them to know what was the
  matter.</p>

  <p>At sight of the others and their burden, however, he had no
  eyes for anything else.</p>

  <p>"What have you got there, John Drillot?"</p>

  <p>"A dead man."</p>

  <p>"Aw, then! That's not Gard."</p>

  <p>"It's the only man here, anyway. Pull close up,
  Philip&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not in my boat, John Drillot!" from Peter.</p>

  <p>"We must take this to the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal," said John
  angrily. "If you don't want to come you can wait here. If you
  don't make less noise, I will knock you on the head myself," and
  he jumped down into the boat, and took the dead man from Trevna,
  and laid him carefully in the bows. The others jumped in, and
  Peter, sooner than be knocked on the head or left behind, sulkily
  followed, and sat himself on the extreme edge of the stern as far
  away from the dead man as he could get.</p>

  <h3>HOW JULIE MEDITATED EVIL</h3>

  <p>Nance had crouched all the morning, in the bracken above
  Breni&egrave;re, on the knife-edge of expectancy. And behind her,
  at a safe distance, crouched Julie Hamon, watching Nance and
  L'Etat at the same time, as a cat in the shade watches a sparrow
  playing in the sunshine.</p>

  <p>"What will be the end? What will be the end?" sighed Nance.
  They had all gone down out of sight, across there, and it was
  terrible to sit here waiting, waiting, waiting for what she
  feared.</p>

  <p>If they had indeed run Gard to his hiding-place, as Philip
  Vaudin had said, there could be but one possible end to it; and
  she sat, sad-eyed and wistful, waiting for them to come up
  again.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if they would never come, and she never took her
  eyes off the rock wall on L'Etat.</p>

  <p>And then at last she sprang to her feet. One of them had come
  up again. She could not see which. Then the others appeared, and
  they seemed to stand talking. Then one went off round the slope
  and another ran after him, and the other two went back into the
  rock wall.</p>

  <p>What could they be at? She stood gazing intently.</p>

  <p>The two came up again, and&mdash;yes&mdash;they carried
  something, or one of them did, and they two went off round the
  corner also. And presently she saw the boat coming round, and saw
  by its head that it was for the Creux. She turned and sped across
  by the same way as yesterday, and Julie followed her at a safe
  distance. And it seemed to Nance, as she hurried through the
  familiar hedge-gaps and lanes and across the headlands, that the
  world had lost its brightness, and that life was desperately hard
  and trying.</p>

  <p>On Derrible Head there might be a chance of seeing. She ran up
  to the highest point by the old cannon, just as the boat was
  coming in under La Conch&eacute;e.</p>

  <p>And&mdash;oh, mon Dieu! mon Dieu! yes&mdash;there, in the
  bows, lay the body of a man!&mdash;and the tears she had kept
  back all day broke out now in a fury of weeping. She could hardly
  see, but she ran on, falling at times and bruising herself,
  staggering to her feet again, stumbling blindly through a mist of
  tears.</p>

  <p>The boat was drawn up by the time she got there, and a curious
  crowd surrounded it. She pushed through. She must see.</p>

  <p>And then the weight fell off her heart, and it was all she
  could do to keep from screaming. For this poor thing, whatever it
  was, was not Stephen Gard and never had been.</p>

  <p>She wanted to sing and dance and scream her joy aloud. They
  had not found him.</p>

  <p>"What is this, John Drillot?" asked Julie, alongside her,
  black with anger, as she pointed to the body.</p>

  <p>"Ma f&eacute;&mdash;a ghost, they say. John Trevna shot him,
  but he had been dead a long time before that, though he was alive
  last night, for Peter had hold of his leg as he ran."</p>

  <p>"And where is the other&mdash;the one you went for?"</p>

  <p>"He's not on L'Etat, anyway, ma fille," and they lifted the
  body on to a piece of sailcloth, and carried it off through the
  tunnel for the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal to look into.</p>

  <p>So Stephen Gard's hiding-place had proved effective, and they
  had not found him. But, of a certainty, he must be starving, and
  so away home sped Nance, to prepare a parcel of food to take
  across to him. And Julie, her black brows pinched together and
  her face set in a frown of venomous intention, never once let her
  out of her sight.</p>

  <p>It was after midnight when Nance stole across the fields,
  carrying her little parcel and her swimming-bladders, and made
  her way to Breni&egrave;re point.</p>

  <p>It was a still night, with a sky full of stars, and her heart
  was high for the moment, though when her thoughts ran on, in
  spite of her, it fell again. For things could not go on this way
  for ever, and she saw no way out.</p>

  <p>She dropped her outer things by a bush, and let herself
  quietly down the rocks and into the water, and the black-faced
  woman who presently stood by that bush snarled curses after her
  and was filled with unholy exultation. For Nance could have only
  one reason for going across there, and on the morrow the men
  should hear of it, and she would give them no rest till Gard was
  made an end of.</p>

  <p>What that thing was that they had brought home, she did not
  know, but they were fools to be satisfied with that when the man
  they had gone after was undoubtedly still on the rock.</p>

  <p>So she sat down by Nance's gown and cloak, and revolved
  schemes for her discomfiture and the undoing of Stephen Gard.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER
  XXXIII</h2>

  <h3>HOW HOPE CAME ONCE AGAIN</h3>

  <p>Nance found the passage of the Race more trying then ever
  before. The strain of these latter days had been very great, and
  the thought of Bernel tended to unnerve her.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the knowledge that Gard had outwitted the
  whole strength of the Island cheered and braced her, and she
  struggled valiantly through the broken waters till at last she
  hung panting on the black ledge where she was in the habit of
  landing.</p>

  <p>She scrambled up among the boulders and made straight for the
  great wall. She had decided in her own mind that he would
  probably be somewhere in there, possibly afraid to come out, as
  he would not know if the Sark men were still on the rock.</p>

  <p>As nearly as she could, she climbed to the place she had seen
  the men go in, and then she cried softly, "Steve! Mr. Gard!" and
  went on calling, as she moved up and down along the base of the
  wall.</p>

  <p>And at last her heart jumped wildly as she heard her name
  faintly from inside the wall, and presently Gard himself came
  crawling from under the big slab and jumped down to her side.</p>

  <p>"Nance! You are a good angel to me," and he flung his arms
  round her and kissed her again and again.</p>

  <p>"But oh, my dear, I would not have you risk your life for me
  like this."</p>

  <p>"It is nothing. I am all right," said Nance, forgetting the
  weariness and dangers of the passage in her joy at finding him
  alive and well. "I have brought you food," and she pushed her
  little parcel into his hands.</p>

  <p>"I hardly dare to eat it when I think what it has cost
  you."</p>

  <p>"That would be foolish, and you must be starving."</p>

  <p>"Truly, I am hungry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eat, then!" and she seized the package and began to tear it
  open. "It will make me still more glad to see you eat."</p>

  <p>"Well, then&mdash;" and Nance was gladder than ever that she
  had come.</p>

  <p>"Have they all gone back?" he asked anxiously, as he
  munched.</p>

  <p>"They came back this morning, bringing a strange dead
  man."</p>

  <p>"I know. I put him there&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"I found him in a cave inside the rock. He had been left there
  very many years ago with his hands and feet tied. I think he must
  have been a Customs officer of long ago."</p>

  <p>Nance shivered, and he felt it.</p>

  <p>"You are cold, Nance dear, and I am thinking only of myself;"
  and he took off his jacket and put it over her slim wet
  shoulders, in spite of herself.</p>

  <p>"If they have all gone back we could go to the shelter. They
  may have left some of the things there;" and they went along and
  found the cloak and blanket, and he wrapped them about her.</p>

  <p>"I found a still larger cave out of the other one, and I was
  in there when they came after me. I had put the dead man in the
  tunnel, and when I came back he was gone; but I did not dare to
  come out, for I was afraid they might be on the watch still."</p>

  <p>"The dead man frightened them. I do not think they will come
  back. They are afraid of ghosts."</p>

  <p>"I hoped he would scare them. But what is to be the end of it
  all, Nance dear? Things cannot go on this way. Would it be
  possible to get me a boat and let me get over to Guernsey?"</p>

  <p>"If you will wait a little time, that is what we must do, if
  the truth does not come out."</p>

  <p>"And meanwhile you may be drowned in trying to keep me from
  starving."</p>

  <p>"I shall not be drowned and you shall not starve," she said
  resolutely.</p>

  <p>"I would sooner live on puffins' eggs than have you swim
  across that place. My heart goes right down into my feet when I
  think of it."</p>

  <p>"There is no need. I am all right."</p>

  <p>"The S&eacute;n&eacute;chal and the Seigneur could not stop
  them?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Le Pelley is in Guernsey still. The
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal they would not listen to. But the truth
  will come out if only you will wait."</p>

  <p>"If I get away, will you come to me, Nance? And all my life I
  will give to making you happy."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will come. But it will be sore leaving Sark. To a
  Sark-born there is no other place in the world like Sark."</p>

  <p>"All my life I will give to making up for it."</p>

  <p>"We will see. Now I must go, or it will be daylight before I
  get back."</p>

  <p>"I shall be in misery till I know you are safe."</p>

  <p>"It will be nearly light. I will wave to you from
  Breni&egrave;re;" and they went slowly round to the ledges, and
  parted with kisses; and in the grey morning light he could, for a
  time, follow the little white figure as it slipped bravely
  through the bristling black waves of the Race.</p>

  <p>But presently he could see her no more, and could but wait,
  full of anxiety and many prayers, for the signal that should tell
  of her safety.</p>

  <p>But it did not come, and he grew desperate and full of
  fears.</p>

  <h3>HOW JULIE'S SCHEMES FELL FLAT</h3>

  <p>Nance found the return journey still more trying to her
  strength, but she struggled through, and was devoutly thankful
  when the slack water under Breni&egrave;re was reached.</p>

  <p>She waded ashore almost too weary to stand, and had to cling
  to the rough rocks till she recovered her breath. Then, slowly
  and heavily, she dragged herself up the lower ledges to the
  little plateau where her clothes were.</p>

  <p>Julie had sat revolving grim schemes in that black head of
  hers.</p>

  <p>She hated the girl. She hated Gard. She hated Sark and every
  one in it. Why had she ever come into these outer wilds? She
  would have done with it all and get away back to the life that
  was more to her taste.</p>

  <p>But first&mdash;yes, mon Dieu, she would leave them something
  to remember her by.</p>

  <p>She had not a doubt that Gard was still on L'Etat. Nothing
  else would take this girl across there. The shameless
  hussy!&mdash;to go swimming across to see her man with nothing
  but a white shift on!</p>

  <p>She could wound Gard through Nance. She could wound Nance
  through Gard.</p>

  <p>She could wait for the girl as she came up the side of the
  Head, and push her down again or crush her with a lump of
  rock.</p>

  <p>But that might mean reprisals on the part of the Islanders.
  She had had experience of the way in which they resented any ill
  done to one of their number by an outsider. She had no wish to
  join Gard on his rock.</p>

  <p>It would be better to hold the girl up to the scorn and
  contempt of the neighbours; that would punish her. And by setting
  the men on Gard's track again, that would punish him and her
  too.</p>

  <p>And so she restrained the natural violence of her temper,
  which would have run to rocks and bodily injury, and waited in
  the bracken till Nance came stumbling along in the half-light.
  Then up she sprang, with an unexpectedness that for the moment
  took Nance's breath and set her heart pounding with dreadful
  certainties of ghosts.</p>

  <p>"So this is how you go to visit your fancy monsieur on the
  rock, is it, little Nance? And with nothing on but that! Oh
  shame! What will the neighbours say when they hear how you swim
  across to him, and you will not dare deny it?"</p>

  <p>But Nance, relieved in her mind on the score of ghosts, and
  regaining her composure with her breath, simply turned her back
  on her and proceeded as if she were not there.</p>

  <p>"And he is there still!" screamed Julie, dancing round with
  rage to keep face to face with her. "I was sure of it, though
  those fools could not find him. I'll see that he's found or
  starved out, b'en s&ucirc;r! Yes, if I have to go myself and see
  to it. As for you&mdash;shameless one!&mdash;it's the last time
  you'll swim across there, yes indeed!"&mdash;and she raved on and
  on, as only an angry woman with a grievance can.</p>

  <p>Nance slipped her dress over her head and, under cover of it,
  dropped off her wet undergarment, coolly wrung it out, put on her
  cloak and walked away, Julie raging alongside with wild words
  that tumbled over one another in their haste.</p>

  <p>Nance walked to the highest point behind Breni&egrave;re, and
  waved her white garment a dozen times to let Gard know she was
  safe, and then turned and set off home through the waist-high
  bracken and the great cushions of gorse. And close alongside her
  went Julie, raging and raving the worse for her silence; for
  there is nothing so galling to an angry soul as to find its most
  venomous shafts fall harmless from the triple mail of quiet
  self-possession.</p>

  <p>So they came through the other cottages to La Closerie, but
  the neighbours were all asleep, and those who woke at the sound
  of her violence, turned over and said, "It's only that mad
  Frenchwoman in one of her tantrums. Why, in Heaven's name, can't
  she go to sleep, like other folks?"</p>

  <p>Nance went into her own house and quietly closed the door.
  Julie hammered on it with her fists, as she would dearly have
  liked to hammer on Nance's face, and then cursed herself off into
  her own place, slamming the door with such violence as to waken
  all the fowls and set all the pigs grunting in their sleep.</p>

  XXXV</h2>

  <h3>HOW AN ANGEL CAME BRINGING THE TRUTH</h3>

  <p>Gard's eyes, straining into the dimness of the coming dawn
  through what seemed to him a most terrible long time, so packed
  was it with anxious fears, caught at last the white flicker of
  Nance's signal, and he dropped down just where he stood, among
  the rough stones of the ridge, with a grateful sigh.</p>

  <p>The strain was telling on him. He felt physically weak and
  worn. Nance's devoted love and courage made his heart beat high,
  indeed, but his fears on her account strung his laxed cords to
  breaking point, and then left them looser than before.</p>

  <p>He must get away somehow, if only to prevent this constant and
  terrible risking of her life on his behalf.</p>

  <p>He hardly dared to hope that his strategy with the dead man
  would be of any permanent benefit to him, though there was no
  knowing. Examination of the body would show that it had been dead
  for very many years, but his knowledge of the Island
  superstitions made him doubt if any Sark man would willingly
  spend a night on L'Etat for a very long time to come.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if the result of their discussions
  confirmed them in the belief that he was still there, and if, as
  he constantly feared, they should learn of Nance's comings, and
  visit upon her the venom they harboured for him, they might so
  invest the rock that escape would be impossible.</p>

  <p>Meagre living, starvation even, he would suffer rather than
  live more amply at risk of Nance's life, but if the hope of
  ultimate escape was taken from him then he might as well give in
  at once and have done with it.</p>

  <p>So he lay there, in the broken rocks of the ridge, and looked
  grimly on life. And the sun rose in a red ball over France, and
  cleft a shining track across the grey face of the waters, and
  drew up the mists and thinned away the clouds, till the great
  plain of the sea and the great dome above were all deep flawless
  blue, and he saw a thin white curl of smoke rise from the miners'
  cottages on Sark.</p>

  <p>He lay there listless, nerveless, careless of life almost, an
  Ishmael with every man's hand against him&mdash;worse off than
  Ishmael, he thought, since Ishmael had a desert in which to
  wander, and he was tied to this bare rock.</p>

  <p>But there was Nance! There was always Nance. And at thought of
  her, his bruised soul found somewhat of comfort and courage once
  more.</p>

  <p>He felt her quivering in his arms again as he pressed her
  close. He felt again the willing surrender of her sweet wet face.
  And the thought of it thrilled his cold blood and set it coursing
  through his veins like new life. Yes, truly, while there was
  Nance there was hope.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal and the Vicar would prevail
  upon them. Perhaps they would give it up and leave him alone, and
  then Nance would find him a boat and they would get across to
  Guernsey. Perhaps, as she kept insisting, something would happen
  to discover the truth.</p>

  <p>So he lay, while the sun mounted high and baked him on the
  bare stones, but he did not find it hot.</p>

  <p>And then, of a sudden, he stiffened and lay watching
  anxiously. For there, from out the Creux had come a
  boat&mdash;and another, and another, and another&mdash;four
  boat-loads of them again!</p>

  <p>So they were coming, after all, and his hopes died sudden
  death.</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;let them come and take him and have their will. He
  was not the first who had paid the price for what he had not
  done, and human nature must fall to pieces if hung too long on
  tenterhooks.</p>

  <p>He watched them listlessly. He could crawl into his innermost
  cavern, of course, and could hold it against them all till the
  end of time, which in this case would be but a trifling span, for
  a man must eat to live. But what was the use? As well die quick
  as slow, since there could be but one end to it. And then, to his
  very great surprise, the boats crept slowly out of sight round
  the corner of Coup&eacute;e Bay, and he lay wondering.</p>

  <p>What could be the meaning of that? Why had they put in there?
  Why couldn't they come on and finish the matter?</p>

  <p>The sea was all deserted again. If he had not just happened to
  catch sight of them stealing across there, he would have felt
  sure they were not coming to-day.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they were going to wait there till night, though why
  on earth they should wait there instead of at the Creux, was past
  his comprehension.</p>

  <p>And then, after a time, to his amazement, he saw them all go
  crawling back the way they had come. One, two, three,
  four&mdash;yes, they were all there, and they crept slowly round
  L&acirc;ches point and disappeared, and left him gaping.</p>

  <p>It was past believing. It was altogether beyond him. He lay,
  with his eyes glued to the point round which they had gone,
  stupid with the wonder of it.</p>

  <p>They had actually given it up&mdash;for to-day, at least, and
  gone back! He cudgelled his brains for the meaning of it all,
  till they grew dull and weary with futile thinking.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Nance and the Vicar and the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal had
  prevailed after all! Perhaps something had turned up at last to
  prove to the Sark men their misjudgment! Perhaps&mdash;well, any
  way, it was good to be left alone.</p>

  <p>He lay there, laxed with the over-strain of all this
  upsetting, but rejoicing placidly in this one more day of
  life.</p>

  <p>He felt like one granted a day's respite as he stands on the
  scaffold with the rope round his neck.</p>

  <p>Never had the sun shone so brightly. Never had the silver sea
  danced so merrily. It might be the last he would see of them.</p>

  <p>And the sun wheeled on towards Guernsey, and made his
  deliberate preparations for a setting beyond the ordinary; for
  the sun, you must know, takes a very special pride in showing the
  great cliffs of Sark what he can do in the way of transformation
  scenes and most transcendent colouring.</p>

  <p>And Stephen Gard lay there under the ridge on L'Etat, with the
  wonder and beauty of it all in his face and in his heart, and
  said to himself that it was probably the last sunset he would
  ever see, and he was glad to have seen it at its best.</p>

  <p>He had a vague idea that heaven would be something like
  that&mdash;tenderly soft and beautiful, and glowing with
  radiances of unearthly splendour, which whispered to weary hearts
  of the peace and joy that lay beyond, and gently called them home
  to rest.</p>

  <p>His theology was, without doubt, of the most elemental and
  objective, and would not have carried him any great lengths in
  these days; but, for the time being, at all events, it lifted its
  possessor to a plane of thought above his usual, and tended to
  quietness and peace of mind.</p>

  <p>The sky right away into the east was glowing softly with the
  wonders of the sunset, and there the delicate tones changed
  almost momentarily. As his eye followed the tender grace of their
  transformations, with a delight which he could neither have
  expressed nor explained, it once more lighted suddenly upon that
  which he had been looking for so anxiously all day long, and
  brought him to earth like a broken bird.</p>

  <p>Once more a boat had come round the point of Les L&acirc;ches,
  and this time it was speeding towards him as fast as a sail that
  was as flat almost as a board, and looked to him no more than a
  thin white cone, could bring it.</p>

  <p>So they were coming, after all, and this wonderful sunset
  might be his last indeed;&mdash;and all the tender beauty of the
  fleecy clouds thinned and paled, and the glory faded as though it
  had all been but a glorious bubble, and that sharp point of
  white, speeding across the darkening sea, had pricked it.</p>

  <p>But why on earth were they coming now? They had missed the
  ebb, and it was hours yet to next half-ebb, and they could not
  hope to land. The white waves were boiling all along the ledges,
  and the sea for twenty feet out was a surging dapple of foam
  laced with seething white bubbles. It would be more than any
  man's life was worth to try and get ashore on L'Etat for many an
  hour yet.</p>

  <p>And there was only one boat! What had become of all the
  others&mdash;of the threatened invasion in force? He sat and
  watched it in gloomy wonder.</p>

  <p>The boat came racing on. As she cleared Breni&egrave;re her
  white sail turned to red gold, and the sea below grew purple.
  There was something white in her bows. He got up heavily,
  doggedly, forced to it against his will, and walked along the
  ridge to the eastern point which commanded the landing-place on
  that side.</p>

  <p>There was, without doubt, something white in the bows of the
  boat, and as he stood gazing at it, it took, to his dazed
  imagination, the strange form of Nance waving joyful hands to
  him.</p>

  <p>He drew his hands across his eyes. The storm had been sore on
  them.</p>

  <p>The bristling waves of the Race burst in sheets of spray under
  the glancing bows, but the white spray and the white figure and
  the pointed white sail were all ablaze in the last rays of the
  sun, and they all swam before him as if his head was going
  round.</p>

  <p>She came round Quette d'Amont with a fine sweep, like one
  bound on business of which she had no reason to be ashamed, and
  dropped her sail and lay in the shelter of the rock.</p>

  <p>And the white figure in the bows was truly Nance, and she was
  standing and waving and calling to him. And the grey-headed man
  aft was surely Philip Guille, the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, and the
  faces of the rest were all friendly.</p>

  <p>He stumbled hastily down to the lower ledges, but the rush and
  the roar there drowned their voices.</p>

  <p>What were they trying to tell him? What could they want of
  him?</p>

  <p>The S&eacute;n&eacute;chal was standing, hands to mouth,
  waiting his chance. The restless waters below drew back for a
  moment to gather for a leap, and the big voice came booming
  across the tumult&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Jump! We'll pick you up! All is well!"</p>

  <p>And Gard, without a moment's hesitation, sprang out into the
  marbled foam, and struck out for the boat.</p>

  <p>They were all friendly hands that gripped him and hauled him
  over the side, and patted him on the back to get the water out of
  him&mdash;all friendly faces that were turned to him; and the
  dearest face of all, lighted with a heavenly gladness, was to him
  as the face of an angel.</p>

  <p>"Tell me!" he gasped, still all astream, wits and clothes
  alike. And it was the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal who told him.</p>

  <p>"Peter Mauger was killed last night, at the same place as Tom
  Hamon, and in the same way. So these hot-blooded thickheads are
  convinced at last that it wasn't your work."</p>

  <p>"Peter Mauger!" he said, gazing vaguely at them all. "But
  who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We haven't found out yet. But even the thickest of the
  thickheads can't put it down to you"&mdash;and the thickheads
  present grinned in friendly fashion, and they ran up the sail
  with a will, and turned her nose, and went racing back to the
  Creux quicker than they had come.</p>

  <p>And Gard sat still with his hand in Nance's two, feeling very
  weak and shaky, and looked vaguely back at L'Etat as it faded and
  dwindled into a dim black triangle of rock.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER
  XXXVI</h2>

  <h3>HOW HE CAME HOME FROM L'ETAT</h3>

  <p>This is what had happened.</p>

  <p>Since Tom Hamon's death, his friend Peter and his widow Julie
  had, as we know, found themselves drawn together by a common
  detestation of Stephen Gard and a common desire for his
  extinction.</p>

  <p>For Peter considered he had been supplanted in Nance's
  regards, though Nance had never regarded him as anything but a
  nuisance and a boor. And Julie considered herself scorned and
  slighted, though Gard had never considered her save as Tom
  Hamon's wife.</p>

  <p>It was they who had stirred up the Sark men against Gard, and
  they missed no opportunity of keeping their ill brew on the
  boil.</p>

  <p>Their offensive alliance brought them much together. Peter was
  often at La Closerie. He was like wax in the hands of the fiery
  Frenchwoman, and she moulded him to her will. The neighbours
  might have begun to talk, but that it was obvious to all that the
  only bond between them at present was their ill-will towards
  Gard, and in that feeling many shared and found nothing strange
  in Tom's wife and Tom's chief friend joining hands to make some
  one pay for his death.</p>

  <p>In time, if it had gone on, the neighbours would doubtless
  have had plenty to say on the subject, for old wives' tongues
  rattled fast of a winter's evening, when they all gathered in
  this house or that, and sat on the sides of the green bed with
  their feet in the dry fern inside, and the oil crasset hanging
  down in the midst, and plied their needles and their tongues and
  wits all at once, and wrought scandalously good guernseys and
  stockings in spite of it all.</p>

  <p>But these were summer evenings yet, and the <i>veilles</i> had not
  begun, and reputations were out at grass till the time came round
  for their inspection and judgment.</p>

  <p>And so, when Peter Mauger never reached home the night before
  this day of which we are telling, his old housekeeper, whatever
  she thought about it at the time, only said afterwards that she
  supposed he had stopped somewhere and would turn up all right in
  the morning, though she admitted that he was not in the habit of
  staying out of a night. Anyway, she was an old woman and all
  alone, and she was not going out to look for him at that time of
  night.</p>

  <p>The morning surprised her by his continued absence. Never in
  his life, so far as she knew, had he behaved like this before.
  Vituperation of him gave place to anxiety about him.</p>

  <p>She questioned the neighbours. All they knew was that he had
  been seen going down to Little Sark soon after sunset.</p>

  <p>"That black Frenchwoman of Tom Hamon's twists him round her
  finger," said one.</p>

  <p>"You tie him up, Mrs. Guille," chuckled another, "or sure as
  beans she'll steal him from you and leave you in the cold."</p>

  <p>And then, who should they see coming striding along the road
  but Madame Julie herself, and evidently in a hurry;&mdash;in a
  state of red-hot excitement, too, as she drew near. And they
  waited, hands on hips, to hear what she was up to now.</p>

  <p>"Where's Peter?" she demanded, a long way in advance. "Tell
  him I want him. That man Gard is still on L'Etat, though those
  fools who went across for him couldn't find him. Cr&eacute; nom!
  What are you all staring at, then?"</p>

  <p>"Where's our Peter?" demanded Mrs. Guille shrilly, with the
  strident note of fear in her voice, as she becked and bobbed
  towards the Frenchwoman like an aged cormorant.</p>

  <p>"Peter? I'm asking you. I want him. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"He went to Little Sark last night, and he's never come
  home."</p>

  <p>"Never come home? Why, what's taken him? If he'd been with me
  last night he'd have seen something! That Nance Hamon swam across
  to the rock with nothing on but her shift to take food to Gard,
  and I caught her at it&mdash;the shameless hussy!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe Peter's heard of it an' gone across with 'em again,"
  suggested one. "He was terrible hot against Gard."</p>

  <p>"And reason he had to be hot against him," cried Julie.
  "Who'll find out for me where he's got to, and when they're going
  out after Gard? I would go too and see the end of him."</p>

  <p>A couple of burly husbands came rolling round the corner
  towards their breakfasts and caught her words.</p>

  <p>"Doubt you'll have to go alone, mistress," said one,
  phlegmatically. "There's ghosts on L'Etat, they do say, though
  sure the one John Drillot brought across was dead enough."</p>

  <p>"If he's there," said the other, plumbing Julie's feelings,
  "he's safe as a pig in a pen."</p>

  <p>"Where's our Peter?" demanded Mrs. Guille.</p>

  <p>"Peter? I d'n know. What's come of him?" and they stared
  blankly at her.</p>

  <p>"He went to Little Sark last night to see her"&mdash;with a
  beck of distaste towards Julie&mdash;"and he's never come
  home."</p>

  <p>The men looked from the speaker to Julie, as though the next
  word necessarily lay with her.</p>

  <p>"I never set eyes on him. I was out after that girl. I came
  here to tell him about Gard. Has he been to the harbour?"</p>

  <p>"No, he hasn't. We are from there now."</p>

  <p>"He's maybe with some of them arranging about going to
  L'Etat," said Julie. "I'll go and find out;" and she set off
  along the road past the windmill.</p>

  <p>The morning passed in fruitless enquiries. She asked this one
  and that, every one she could think of, if they had seen Peter,
  and was met everywhere with meaning grins and point-blank
  denials. Apparently no one had set eyes on Peter, and every one
  seemed to imply that she ought io know more about him than any
  one else.</p>

  <p>It was past mid-day before she was back at Vauroque, but Mrs.
  Guilie was still standing in the doorway of Peter's empty house
  as if she had been looking out for news of him ever since.</p>

  <p>"Eh b'en? Have you found him?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Not a finger of him!" snapped Julie savagely, tired out with
  her fruitless labours.</p>

  <p>"Then he's come to some ill, b&agrave; s&uacute;. And if he
  has&mdash;ma f&eacute;, it's you!&mdash;it's you!" The old lady's
  scream of denunciation choked itself with its own excess, and the
  neighbours came running out to learn the news.</p>

  <p>Stolid minds travel in grooves, and old Mrs. Guille's had been
  groping along possibilities of all kinds, clinging at the same
  time to the hope that Peter would still turn up all right.</p>

  <p>Now that her hope was shattered her mind dropped naturally
  into a grim groove, along which it had taken a tentative trip
  during the morning and had recoiled from with a shudder.</p>

  <p>The last time Mrs. Tom Hamon had come seeking a man who was
  missing, that man had been found under the Coup&eacute;e, and so
  old Mrs. Guille set oft for the Coup&eacute;e as fast as her old
  legs and her want of breath and general agitation would let
  her.</p>

  <p>"Nom de Dieu! What&mdash;?" began Julie, with twisted black
  brows, and then drifted on with the rest in Mrs. Guille's
  wake&mdash;all except one or two housewives whose men were due
  for dinner, and knew they must be fed whatever had come to Peter
  Mauger.</p>

  <p>"Gaderabotin!" said one of these as he came up, and stood
  scratching his head and gazing down the road after them. "What's
  taken them all?"</p>

  <p>"Think because they found Tom Hamon there, they'll find Peter
  too," guffawed another, and they rolled on into their homes,
  chuckling at the simplicity of women and children.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the Coup&eacute;e, the little mob of
  sensation-seekers peered fearfully about. One small boy, cleverer
  or more groovy-minded than the rest, struck off along the
  headland to the left. It was from there Charles Guille had seen
  Tom Hamon. Perhaps from there he would see something, too.</p>

  <p>And no sooner was he there, where he could see to the foot of
  the cliffs in Coup&eacute;e Bay, than he commenced to dance and
  wave his arms like a mad thing, because the words he wanted to
  shout choked him tight so that he could hardly breathe.</p>

  <p>They streamed out along the cliff and huddled there, struck
  chill with fright in spite of the blazing sun.</p>

  <p>For there, under the cliff, in the same spot as they found Tom
  Hamon, lay another dark, huddled figure, and they knew it must be
  Peter.</p>

  <p>The finding of Tom had filled them with anger against Gard.
  The finding of Peter filled them with fear.</p>

  <p>Gard had sufficed as explanation and scapegoat for Tom's
  death, and as vent for their feelings. But what of Peter's?</p>

  <p>It had not been Gard, then? And if not Gard, who?</p>

  <p>For, whoever it was, he was still at large, and any of them
  might be the next.</p>

  <p>There were new terrors in the eyes that gazed so wildly on the
  narrow white path and the towering pinnacles of the
  Coup&eacute;e. They had been familiar with it all, all their
  lives, but suddenly it had become strange to them.</p>

  <p>If grisly Death, all bones and scythe, had come stalking along
  it before their eyes at that moment, they would have shrieked, no
  doubt, and fallen flat, but he would have no more than answered
  to their feelings and fulfilled their expectations.</p>

  <p>As it was, when the Seigneur's big white stallion stuck his
  head over the green dyke behind them, and gave a shrill neigh at
  the unexpected sight of so many people in a field which was
  usually occupied only by Charles Guille's two mild-eyed cows and
  their calves, the women screamed and the children lied.</p>

  <p>"Man doux! but I thought it was the devil himself," said old
  Mrs. Guille. "Oui-gia!" and shook an angry fist at him.</p>

  <p>But the discoverer of the body was already away along the road
  to Vauroque, covering the ground like a little incarnation of
  ill-news.</p>

  <p>The exertion of running cleared away the choking, if it took
  his breath. He shouted as he drew near the houses.</p>

  <p>"Ah, bah!" growled one of the diners inside. "What's to do
  now, then?"</p>

  <p>"He's there ... Peter ... under Coup&eacute;e ... Where Tom
  Hamon...." panted the news-bearer as he tore past to his own
  home. And the rest of Vauroque emptied itself into the road and
  stood looking along it, as the stragglers came up, white-faced
  and wild-eyed.</p>

  <p>"He's there," confirmed one woman, twisting up her loosened
  hair. "And just same place where Tom Hamon lay."</p>

  <p>"'Tweren't Gard killed <i>him</i>, then," said one of the diners,
  chewing over that thought with his last mouthful.</p>

  <p>"Nor Tom neither, then, maybe," said another.</p>

  <p>"We've bin on wrong tack, then;" and they went off round the
  corner at a speed their build would hardly have credited them
  with.</p>

  <p>One to the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal and one to the Doctor, and
  then to the Creux, both telling the news as they went. So that
  when the officials came hurrying through the tunnel the greater
  part of the Island was waiting for them on the shingle, except
  those who preferred the wider view from the cliff above.</p>

  <p>Some of the men had been for pulling across at once, but they
  were overborne.</p>

  <p>"Doctor said he'd like to have seen him afore he was moved
  last time," said old John de Carteret weightily, and would not
  let a boat go out till the Doctor and the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal
  came.</p>

  <p>It was all waiting for them the moment they arrived, however,
  and they stepped in and swung away round Les L&acirc;ches, and
  three other boats followed them so closely that it looked almost
  like a gruesome race who should get there first.</p>

  <p>There was little talking in any of the boats, but there was
  some solid hard thinking, in a mazed kind of way.</p>

  <p>Until they knew more of the facts, indeed, they scarce knew
  what to think yet. But more than one of them remembered
  disturbedly how they had gone in force two days before to fetch
  Gard off his lonely rock, or to make an end of him there; and
  here they were going in force on a very different errand&mdash;an
  errand which, they could not help seeing, would bring him off his
  rock in a very different way, if this present matter was what it
  looked as if it might be.</p>

  <p>And the Doctor was not long in giving them the facts, when
  they had run up on to the shingle, and then crunched through it
  to the place where Peter's body lay under the steep black
  cliff&mdash;in the exact spot where Tom Hamon's had lain just
  eighteen days before.</p>

  <p>But that it was undoubtedly Peter's face and body, those who
  had come after Tom the last time might have thought they were
  going through their previous experience over again. It was all so
  like.</p>

  <p>They all stood round in a dark, silent group while the Doctor
  carefully examined the body, and the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal
  looked on with stern and troubled face.</p>

  <p>"It is most extraordinary," said the Doctor, straightening up
  from his task at last, and his face, too, was knitted with
  perplexity, but had something else in it besides. "This man has
  been done to death in exactly the same way as Hamon"&mdash;a
  rustle of surprise shook the group of silent onlookers. "The head
  has been beaten in just as Hamon's was&mdash;with some blunt
  rounded tool, I should say. These other wounds and contusions are
  the results of his fall down the cliff. He has been dead at least
  eight hours. Lift him carefully, men. We can do nothing more
  here&mdash;unless by chance the one who did it flung his weapon
  after him, and we could find it."</p>

  <p>They scattered, and searched the whole dark bay minutely, but
  found nothing. Then with rough gentleness they bore the body to
  the boat and laid it under the thwarts.</p>

  <p>"Men!" said the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal weightily, as they were
  just about to climb back into their boats. "This matter brings
  another matter home to all our hearts. You have been persecuting
  another man under the belief that he killed Tom Hamon. From what
  some of us knew of Mr. Gard, we were certain he could have had no
  hand in it. This, I take it, proves it?" He looked at the
  Doctor.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly!" nodded the Doctor. "The man who killed this one
  killed the other, and that man could not be Stephen Gard, for he
  is on L'Etat."</p>

  <p>"It's God's mercy that you haven't Mr. Gard's blood on your
  heads. Some of you, I know, have done your best that way. Suppose
  you had killed him that other night&mdash;what would you have
  felt as you stood here to-day? Take that thought home with you,
  and may God keep you from like misjudgment in the future!"</p>

  <p>And they had not a word to say for themselves, but crawled
  silently aboard, and in silence pulled back to Creux Harbour.</p>

  <p>Once only old John de Carteret spoke to the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, soon after they had started.</p>

  <p>"One of them"&mdash;nodding over at the boats
  behind&mdash;"could go to the rock and bring him off," he
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"I thought of that, but there's one I want to go with me.
  She'll be down at the Creux, I expect, and we'll go as soon as
  we've disposed of this."</p>

  <p>There was a very different feeling visible in the silent crowd
  that awaited them at the harbour this time from that manifested
  on the last occasion, Then, it was a sympathetic anger that
  united them all in a common feeling against the perpetrator of
  the deed. Now&mdash;even before the whisper had run round that
  Peter Mauger had been done to death in the same way as Tom
  Hamon&mdash;fear was among them, and doubt. Fear of they knew not
  exactly what, and doubt of they knew not whom.</p>

  <p>But here were two men done to death in their midst, and the
  man on whom all their suspicions had settled in the first case
  could not possibly have had anything to do with the second, and
  so had most likely had nothing to do with either&mdash;in which
  case the man who had was still at large among them, and no man's
  life was safe, much less any woman's or child's.</p>

  <p>Their thoughts did not run, perhaps, quite so clearly as that,
  but that was the result of it all, and their faces showed it.
  Furthermore, every man and woman there began at once to cast
  about in his and her mind for the possible murderer, and men
  looked at the neighbours whom they had known all their lives,
  with lurking suspicions in their eyes and the consideration of
  strange possibilities in their minds.</p>

  <p>Tom Hamon's death had bound them closer together; Peter
  Mauger's set them all apart. The strange dead man up in the
  school-house added to their discomfort.</p>

  <p>It was not until the hastily-constructed litter with its
  gruesome burden had been sent off to the Boys' School, in charge
  of the constables and the Doctor, that the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal
  caught sight of Nance's eager white face and anxious eyes, in the
  crowd that lingered still in answer to another whisper that had
  flown round.</p>

  <p>If they were at once pig-headed and hot-blooded and
  suspicious, they were also warm-hearted and willing to atone for
  a mistake&mdash;once they were sure of it.</p>

  <p>No crowd followed Peter on his last journey but one, though
  the whole Island had swarmed after Tom Hamon.</p>

  <p>They wanted to see the man who would have been killed for
  killing Tom, though he didn't do it, but for&mdash;circumstances,
  and his own pluck and endurance.</p>

  <p>And when the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal beckoned to one of the
  circumstances, and put his hand on her slim shoulder, and
  said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We are going for him. I thought you would like to come too,"
  her face went rosy with gratitude, and the brave little hands
  clasped up on to her breast, as she murmured&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh, M. le S&eacute;n&eacute;chal!" and choked at anything
  more.</p>

  <p>Those nearest gave her rough words of encouragement.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, Nance! You'll soon have him back!"</p>

  <p>"That's a brave garche! Don't cry about it now!"</p>

  <p>"We'll make it up to him, lass. We'll all come and dance at
  the wedding"&mdash;and so on.</p>

  <p>But the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal patted her on the shoulder and
  asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And where is your brother? He should come, too. I hear you
  have both been in this matter."</p>

  <p>"Ah, monsieur!" she said, with brimming eyes and a pathetic
  little lift and fall of the hand, which expressed far more than
  she could put into words. "We fear ... we fear he is drowned. He
  swam out to the rock taking food, and ... and ... we have not
  seen him since;" and her hand was over her face and the tears
  streaming through.</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu! Another!" said the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, aghast.
  "When, child? When was this?"</p>

  <p>"The night after the storm, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he is there, on the rock."</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur. I was over there myself last night. He never
  got there, and we fear he must be drowned."</p>

  <p>"You were over there, child? Why, how did you get across?"</p>

  <p>"I swam, monsieur;" and he stared at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! You make up for some of the others," he
  said bluntly. "Come then, and we will make sure of this one,
  anyhow;" and he led the way to John de Carteret's boat, and all
  the people gave them a cheer as they pulled out of the harbour to
  catch the breeze off the L&acirc;ches.</p>

  <p>Then the crowd waited for their return, and talked by snatches
  of all these strange happenings, and discussed and discounted the
  chances of Bernel's being still alive.</p>

  <p>"For, see you, the Race! And that was the first night after
  the storm, and it would be running like the deuce, bidemme!"
  "It's best not to know how to swim if it leads you to do things
  like that, oui-gia!" "When a man's time comes, he cuts his cleft
  in the water, whether he can swim or not, crais b'en!" "And that
  slip of a Nance had been over there last night&mdash;par
  mad&eacute;, some folks have the courage!" "All the same, it was
  madness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But behind all the broken chatter, in every mind was the grim
  question, "Who is it, then, that is doing these things amongst
  us?" And there was a feeling of mighty discomfort abroad.</p>

  <p>All the same, they cheered vigorously as the boat came
  speeding back, and they saw Gard sitting between Nance and the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, and crowded round as it ran up the
  shingle, and would have lifted him out and carried him
  shoulder-high through the tunnel and up the road, if he would
  have had it.</p>

  <p>They saw how his imprisonment on the rock&mdash;"Ma f&eacute;,
  think of it!&mdash;all through that storm, too!"&mdash;had told
  upon him. His cheeks were hollow, and his eyes sunken, and he
  looked very weary&mdash;"and, man doux, no wonder, after eighteen
  days on L'Etat!"&mdash;though their friendly shouts had put a
  touch of colour in his face and a spark in his eyes for the
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Now, away home, all of you!" ordered the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal. "We've all had enough to think about for
  one day. To-morrow we will see what is to be done."</p>

  <p>"Too much!" croaked one old crone, who had something of a
  reputation among her neighbours. "What I want to know
  is&mdash;who killed Peter Mauger?"</p>

  <p>And that was the question that occupied most minds in Sark
  that night.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER
  XXXVII</h2>

  <h3>HOW THEY LAID TRAPS FOR THE DEVIL</h3>

  <p>The Doctor insisted on taking care of Gard. He took him into
  his own house at Dixcart, and began at once a course of treatment
  based on common-sense and the then most scientific attainment,
  and calculated to repair the waste of the Rock and build him up
  anew in the shortest time compatible with an efficient and
  permanent cure.</p>

  <p>Even when Gard felt quite himself again and would have
  returned to his work, the genial autocrat would not hear of
  it.</p>

  <p>"Just you stop here, my boy," he ordered. "An experience such
  as you have had needs some getting over. You can stand a good
  rest and some fattening up, and those &mdash;&mdash; mines must
  wait."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Island was in a smoulder of suspicion and
  superstition.</p>

  <p>No one had yet ventured openly to point the finger at any
  reasonably possible doer of deeds so dark. Behind carefully
  closed doors of a night, indeed, here and there a whisper
  suggested that the Frenchwoman might be at the bottom of it all.
  But the mistake that had already been made, and the consequences
  that came so terribly near to completing it beyond repair, made
  them all cautious of open speech or action.</p>

  <p>Gard's story explained the mystery of the dead stranger and
  relieved the public mind to that extent.</p>

  <p>The S&eacute;n&eacute;chal was disposed to agree with his
  views on the matter.</p>

  <p>"I never heard of those caves on L'Etat," he said musingly, as
  they sat over their pipes one night; "and I'm sure no one else
  knew of them. But there was much free-trading round here in the
  old times, and I've no doubt many a Customs man disappeared and
  was never heard of again, just like this one. All the Islands
  felt very sore about the new regulations, and our people stick at
  nothing when their blood is up."</p>

  <p>"They do not," said Gard feelingly.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to get into that inner cave," said the Doctor
  longingly.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't," said Gard, looking at his size and girth.
  "It's a mighty tight squeeze under the slab, and that tunnel
  would beat you. Unless you've been brought up to that kind of
  thing, you couldn't stand it. It would give you nightmares for
  the rest of your life."</p>

  <p>"That's a rare lass, that little Nance," said the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal. "There's some good in Sark after all, Mr.
  Gard."</p>

  <p>"She was an angel to me," said Gard with feeling. "If it had
  not been for her, I could never have held out. Not for what she
  brought me, but the fact that she came. But it was terrible to me
  to think of her coming through that Race. I begged her not to,
  but she would have her way. Three times she risked her life for
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Three times!" said the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal. "Ma f&eacute;,
  but she's a garche to be proud of!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, and to be more than proud of," said Gard. "She has given
  me my life, and I will give it all to making her happy."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't swim across to L'Etat for any woman in the world,"
  said the Doctor. "Because, in the first place, I couldn't. She
  must have nerves of steel, to say nothing of muscles. In the
  dark, too! And you wouldn't think it to look at her."</p>

  <p>"It needed more than nerves or muscles," said Gard
  quietly.</p>

  <p>Not a man among the Islanders&mdash;much less a
  woman&mdash;would go anywhere near the Coup&eacute;e after dark.
  Even Nance confessed to a preference for daylight passages. And
  Gard, when he went down into Little Sark for a walk, as part of
  his cure, could not repress a cold shiver whenever he passed the
  fatal spot where two men had gone over to their deaths.</p>

  <p>All the old wives' tales were dug up and passed along, growing
  as they went. Little eyes and mouths grew permanently rounded
  with horrors, and the ground was thoroughly well spaded and
  planted with sturdy shoots warranted to yield a noisome harvest
  of superstition for generations to come.</p>

  <p>The occupants of Clos Bourel and Plaisance carefully locked
  their doors of a night now.</p>

  <p>Old Mrs. Carr&eacute; at Plaisance vowed she had heard the
  White Horses go past, on the nights before Tom Hamon and Peter
  were found. And every one knew that when the ghostly horses were
  heard, some one was going to die. But as she had said nothing
  about it before, her contribution to the general uneasiness was
  received with respect before her face but with open doubt behind
  her back.</p>

  <p>Old Nikki Never-mind-his-name&mdash;lest his descendants, if
  he had any, take umbrage at the matter&mdash;swore that he had
  not only seen the ghostly steed pass Vauroque in the dead of
  night, but that it bore a rider whose head was carried carefully
  in his right hand. Unfortunately, the headless one passed so
  quickly that Nikki said he could not distinguish his
  features&mdash;having looked for them first in the wrong
  place&mdash;and so he could not say for certain who the next to
  die would be; but from the knowing wag of his head the neighbours
  were of opinion that he knew more than he chose to tell, and he
  gained quite a reputation thereby.</p>

  <p>But, even here again, doubts were cast upon the matter by
  some, especially those who were acquainted with the old
  gentleman's proclivities towards raw spirits of the material kind
  that paid the lightest of duties in Guernsey.</p>

  <p>All these and very many similar matters were discussed by the
  Doctor&mdash;who disturbed their minds with horrific accounts of
  homicidal mania taking possession of apparently innocent
  souls&mdash;and the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal and the Vicar and
  Stephen Gard, as they sat over their pipes of an evening in the
  Doctor's house. But chiefly the great and troublesome question of
  "Who?"</p>

  <p>They were all of one mind that the matter must be looked into.
  The feeling that a danger was loose in the Island, and might at
  any moment fall upon any man, woman, or child, was past
  endurance. The suspicion that It might be any one of those they
  met every day was insufferable.</p>

  <p>The only difficulty was to decide how to look into
  it&mdash;what to do, and how.</p>

  <p>Each day they feared to hear of some new outrage. But until
  the perpetrator was discovered they could do nothing towards his
  suppression. And, on the other hand, it looked as though they
  could do nothing towards his discovery until he perpetrated some
  new outrage.</p>

  <p>It was Gard who suggested they should watch the Coup&eacute;e
  every night, armed, and unknown to any but themselves.</p>

  <p>And, after much discussion, following out his idea, he and the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal and the Doctor, who could bowl over a
  rabbit as well as any of them, lay in the heather, on the common
  above the cutting on the Little Sark side, for many nights, guns
  in hand, and eyes and ears on the strain, but saw and heard
  nothing.</p>

  <p>One night, indeed, when there was a high wind, the Doctor's
  marrow crawled in his backbone at the sound of groanings and
  moanings and most dolorous cries for help, coming up out of black
  Coup&eacute;e Bay, where they had picked up Tom Hamon's and Peter
  Mauger's dead bodies.</p>

  <p>He sweated cold terrors, for he was on the east headland right
  above the bay, till the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal crawled over to
  him and whispered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Hear 'em?"</p>

  <p>"Y-y-yes. What the d-d-deuce and all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Knew you'd wonder what it was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"W-w-wonder?" chittered the Doctor.</p>

  <p>"It's only the wind in the cave at the corner below
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah! Thought it must be something of that kind," said the
  Doctor through his teeth, clenched hard to keep them in order.
  "Don't wonder folks fight shy of the Coup&eacute;e. Sounded
  uncommonly like spirits. Might give some folks the jumps."</p>

  <p>On another dark and windy night it was the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal's turn to get something of a fright.</p>

  <p>As he lay in the heather, gun in hand, and well wrapped up in
  his big cloak, with all his faculties concentrated on the
  wavering pathway below, it seemed to him that he heard slow heavy
  footsteps approaching.</p>

  <p>His nerves were strung tight. He craned his head to look down
  into the cutting, when suddenly there came a wild snuffle at the
  back of his neck, and as he jumped up with a startled yelp, one
  part anger and nine parts fright, a horse that had grazed down
  upon him in the darkness, leaped back with a snort and a squeal
  and disappeared into the night.</p>

  <p>"Ga'rabotin! but I thought it was the devil himself," said the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, as the others came hurrying up. "Why the
  deuce can't people tie up their horses as they do their cows?
  I'll bring it up at the next Chef Plaids"&mdash;which
  consideration restored his shaken equanimity somewhat, and made
  him feel himself again.</p>

  <p>Nothing more came of all their watching, and over a jorum of
  something hot one night, after they had returned to the Doctor's
  house, it was himself who said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"After all, it stands to reason. Some evil-possessed soul
  seeks victims, and has fixed on the Coup&eacute;e as the place
  best fitted for his work. No one now goes near the Coup&eacute;e
  at night&mdash;ergo, no victims; ergo, no&mdash;er&mdash;no
  manifestations."</p>

  <p>"H'm! Very clever!" said the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, through
  his pipe. "Where does that leave us, then?"</p>

  <p>"We must have a decoy, of course."</p>

  <p>"H'm! You'll not get any Sark man to act as decoy to the
  devil. Besides, they would talk, and that would upset the whole
  thing."</p>

  <p>"What about one of your men, Gard?"</p>

  <p>"It's a dangerous game for any man to play, Doctor.... I don't
  quite see how one could ask it of them,"&mdash;and after a pause
  of concentrated thought and many slow smoke-puffs&mdash;"What
  would you say to me?" and all their eyes settled on him&mdash;the
  Doctor's professionally.</p>

  <p>"Surely you have suffered enough in this matter, Mr. Gard,"
  suggested the Vicar.</p>

  <p>"I would give a good deal, and do a good deal, to get to the
  bottom of it all. Things will never settle down properly till
  this matter is disposed of."</p>

  <p>That, of course, was obvious to them all, but all had the same
  feeling that he had already suffered enough in the matter.</p>

  <p>But consideration of the Doctor's suggestion in all its
  aspects only served to convince them that, if any such scheme was
  to be carried out, it could only be done among themselves, and
  its dangers were obvious.</p>

  <p>It was not a matter to be lightly undertaken by any man. For
  whoever undertook the r&ocirc;le of decoy, undoubtedly took his
  life in his hands; and they spent many evenings over it.</p>

  <p>The Vicar was absolutely against the idea, but had no
  alternative to suggest.</p>

  <p>"It is simply playing with death," said he, "and no man has a
  right to do that."</p>

  <p>"It means a good deal for the Island if we can clear it up,"
  said the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal.</p>

  <p>But, by degrees, they got to discussion of how it might be
  done, and from that to the actual doing was only a heroic
  step.</p>

  <p>The decoy's head must be well padded, of course, for the heads
  of both victims had been the points of attack.</p>

  <p>He must be well armed also, and being forewarned and more, he
  ought to be able to give a certain account of himself.</p>

  <p>And then the Doctor and the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal would be
  close at hand and on the keen look-out for emergencies.</p>

  <p>The Doctor undertook to pad his head with something in the
  nature of a turban under his hat, which, he vowed, would resist
  the impact of iron blows better than metal itself.</p>

  <p>"Leave my ears loose, anyway," said Gard. "I'd like at all
  events to be able to hear it coming."</p>

  <p>The S&eacute;n&eacute;chal had a weapon, part pistol and the
  rest blunderbuss, which had belonged to his father, who had
  always referred to it affectionately as his "dunderbush." It had
  seen strange doings in its time, but had been so long retired
  from the active list, that he undertook to load and fire it
  himself before he said any more about it.</p>

  <p>And he did it next day, with a full charge, in his meadow,
  with the assistance of a gate-post and a long cord, and reported
  it at night as in excellent order, and calculated to blow into
  smithereens anything blowable that stood up before it within the
  short limit of its range.</p>

  <p>At this stage in its proceedings the Vicar reluctantly retired
  from the Committee of Public Safety. He acknowledged the sore
  need of ending the suspicious and superstitious fears which were
  beginning to affect the life of the community in various ways.
  But he could not see his way to any participation in means so
  dangerous to the life of one of their number as those
  suggested.</p>

  <p>He did his best to dissuade Gard from it. He even reminded him
  of the duty he owed to Nance. She had undoubtedly saved his life,
  and she had a premier claim upon his consideration&mdash;and so
  on.</p>

  <p>To all of which Gard fully assented.</p>

  <p>"But," he said gravely, "we are at a deadlock in this other
  matter, and it is just barely possible that this plan may clear
  it all up. I can't say I'm very sanguine that it will. On the
  other hand, I really don't see that any great harm can come to
  me. The others probably suffered because they were taken
  unawares. I shall go in the hope of meeting it, and shall be
  ready for it. Unless, Vicar, you really think it is the devil or
  something of that sort?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think," said the Vicar solemnly. "I
  cannot bring myself to believe any of our Sark men would do such
  dreadful things. I look at each man I meet and say to myself,
  'Now, can it be possible it is you?&mdash;or you?&mdash;or
  you?'&mdash;and it does not seem possible; and yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And yet some one did it, Vicar," said the Doctor, brusquely,
  "and that's just the trouble. Until we find out <i>who</i> did it, any
  man may have done it, and we all look at everybody else, just as
  you do, and say to ourselves, 'Is it you?&mdash;or you?&mdash;or
  you?' Though I'm bound to say I've not got the length yet of
  doubting either you or the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, or Gard, and I
  don't think it's myself. It might quite conceivably be any one of
  us, however, prowling about in our sleep and utterly unconscious
  afterwards of evil-doing."</p>

  <p>"A most awful possibility," said the Vicar. "God grant it may
  turn out differently from that."</p>

  <p>"You never know what this inexplicable machine may do," said
  the Doctor, tapping his head. "However, we'll hope for the best,
  and I think the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal and I ought to be able to
  see Gard through without any very disastrous results. If we
  succeed, he will deserve better of this Island than any man I
  know&mdash;and a sight more than this Island deserves of him. I
  quite understand," he said, as Gard looked quickly up. "And it
  does you credit, my boy; but there are not very many men would do
  it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm afraid I must leave you to it," said the Vicar, and
  did so.</p>

  XXXVIII</h2>

  <h3>HOW THEY LAID THE DEVIL BY THE HEELS</h3>

  <p>When it began to be noised abroad that Gard was going to and
  fro across the Coup&eacute;e, even by night, as if nothing had
  ever happened there, the Sark men shrugged their shoulders and
  said, "Pardie!&mdash;sooner him than me&mdash;oui-gia!"</p>

  <p>It was obviously necessary, however, that this should be
  known. Even the cormorant does not fish where fish are never
  found.</p>

  <p>But when he went to and fro by night, he went
  mailed&mdash;according to the Doctor's ideas&mdash;and
  armed&mdash;according to the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal's; and each
  night the Doctor and the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal went quietly
  down, some time in advance, and lay hidden on the headlands with
  their guns, and never took their eyes off him and all his
  surroundings, while he was in sight.</p>

  <p>And Gard, in nearing the Little Sark cutting, always kept
  carefully to the right-hand side of the path, though it was
  somewhat crumbly there and had fallen away down the slope towards
  Grande Gr&egrave;ve. For he had gone cautiously over the ground
  beforehand, and decided that if there was any possibility of
  being knocked overboard unawares, he would prefer to go over the
  much gentler slope on the right, where one might even at a pinch
  find lodgment among the rubble and bushes, than over the sheer
  fall into Coup&eacute;e Bay, where you could drop a stone almost
  to the shingle below.</p>

  <p>Nance knew nothing whatever of the matter, or she would
  undoubtedly and most reasonably have had something to say about
  it. But knowledge of it could only upset her, and so perhaps
  himself, and he had carefully kept it from her. Little Sark,
  moreover, was more isolated than ever by reason of the
  Coup&eacute;e mystery, and word of his goings and
  comings&mdash;save such as had La Closerie for their object in
  the day-time&mdash;never reached her.</p>

  <p>They were in grievous sorrow down there over Bernel. Gard
  still preached hope, but each day's delay in its realisation
  seemed to them to make it the more unlikely, and their hearts
  were very sore.</p>

  <p>Julie had gone about her work for days after Gard's return
  like a bereft tigress. Then one morning she locked the door of
  her house, put the key in her pocket, and took the cutter for
  Guernsey; and none regretted her going.</p>

  <p>And, as it turned out, though that had not been her intention
  at the time, it was the last Sark was to see of her. Rumours
  reached them later of her marriage to a fellow-countryman, with
  whom she had gone to France. The one thing they knew for certain
  was that she never came back to La Closerie, and after due
  interval, and consequent on other matters, they broke open the
  door and resumed possession of the house.</p>

  <p>Night after night Gard slowly crossed the Coup&eacute;e,
  lingered in its shadows, went on into Little Sark, and came
  lingering back.</p>

  <p>And night after night the Doctor and the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal lay in the heather of the headlands, guns
  in hand, waiting for something that never came, and then going
  stiffly home to one or other of their houses, to lubricate their
  joints and console their disappointment with hot punch and much
  tobacco.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's no go," was the Doctor's grudging verdict at
  last, on the fourteenth blank night.</p>

  <p>"Let's keep on," said Gard. "Things generally happen just when
  you don't expect them."</p>

  <p>"That's so," grunted the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal. And they
  decided to keep on.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the nights were warm and mostly fine. When
  neither moon nor stars afforded him light enough for a safe
  crossing, he took a lantern, so that no one who desired to knock
  him on the head need miss the chance for lack of seeing him.</p>

  <p>And when, after their lonely waiting, the watchers in the
  heather saw the lantern come joggling down the steep cutting from
  Sark, they braced themselves for eventualities, and hefted their
  guns, and pricked up their ears and made ready.</p>

  <p>And when it had wavered slowly along the path between the
  great pits of darkness on either hand, and had gone joggling on
  into Little Sark, they sank back into their formes with each his
  own particular exclamation, and lay waiting till the light came
  back.</p>

  <p>Times of tension and endurance which told upon them all, but
  bore most heavily on Gard, since the onslaught, when it came,
  must fall upon him, and the absolute ignorance as to how and when
  and whence it might come, kept every nerve within him strung like
  a fiddle-string.</p>

  <p>It was the eeriest experience he had ever had, that nightly
  trip across the Coup&eacute;e;&mdash;bad enough when moon or
  stars afforded him vague and distorted glimpses of his ghostly
  surroundings:&mdash;ten times worse when the flicker of his
  lantern barely kept him to the path, and the broken gleams ran
  over the rugged edges and tumbled into the black gulfs at the
  sides;&mdash;when every starting shadow might be a murderer
  leaping out upon him, every foot of the walling darkness the
  murderer's cover, and every step he took a step towards
  death.</p>

  <p>A trip, I assure you, that not many men would have been
  capable of. For it did not by any means end with the
  Coup&eacute;e. When he got to bed of a night, and fell asleep at
  last, he was still crossing the Coup&eacute;e with his joggling
  lantern all night long, and suffered things in dreams compared
  with which even his actual experiences were but holiday
  jaunts.</p>

  <p>And at times these grisly imaginings came back upon him as he
  actually walked the narrow path next night, and it was all he
  could do to keep his head and not fling the lantern into the
  depths of the pit and follow it.</p>

  <p>They were all getting exceedingly weary of the whole business;
  indeed, it was getting on all their nerves in a way which
  threatened consequences, when, mercifully, the end
  came&mdash;suddenly, not at all as they had looked for it, quite
  outside all their expectation.</p>

  <p>It was one of the shrouded nights. The Doctor and the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, flat in the heather, saw the lantern
  issue from the Sark cutting and come joggling towards them. They
  heard a snort of surprise behind them, but gave it no special
  heed. The S&eacute;n&eacute;chal grinned briefly at remembrance
  of his fright when the beast snuffled down his neck that other
  night.</p>

  <p>Then, this is what happened.</p>

  <p>Gard&mdash;his lantern in his left hand, and the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal's father's "dunderbush" in his
  right&mdash;his eyes pinching spooks out of every inch of the
  black wall about him, and every string at its tightest&mdash;had
  reached the crumbly bit of path near the Little Sark side, when,
  like a clap of thunder out of a blue sky, the black silence of
  the cutting vomited uproar&mdash;the wild clang and beat of what
  sounded, in that hollow space, like the trampling of a thousand
  dancing hoofs&mdash;shrill neighings and whinnyings and
  screamings, all blended into an indescribable and blood-curdling
  clamour that gashed the night like an outrage.</p>

  <p>And then, before even he had time to wonder, the great white
  stallion was upon him&mdash;dancing on its hind legs on that
  narrow path like an acrobat, towering above him to twice his own
  height, striking savagely down at him with its great front feet,
  screaming like a fiend.</p>

  <p>He had no time to think. His left arm and the lantern went up
  with the natural instinct of defence. Just one glimpse he
  got&mdash;and never forgot it&mdash;of vicious white eyes and
  teeth, flapping red nostrils, wild-flying hair, and huge pawing
  feet descending on him, with the dirty white hair splaying out
  all round them as they came down. Then his right hand went up
  also, and he fired full into all these things. The lantern and
  the blunderbuss went spinning into the gulf, the great feet beat
  him to the ground, and rose and jabbed down at him with all the
  vicious might that lay behind them&mdash;the savage white muzzle
  shrilling its blood-curdling screams of triumph all the
  while&mdash;and all this in the space of a second. "Good God!"
  cried the Doctor, craning over the eastern bank of the cutting,
  but fearful of firing into the turmoil lest he should hit Gard,
  so dropped himself bodily over on to the path.</p>

  <p>Then the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal's Sark eyes saw the great
  white head, with its flying veil of hair, as it towered up for
  another vicious jab at the fallen man, and he emptied both
  barrels of his gun into it.</p>

  <p>A wild scream that shrilled along the night and woke Plaisance
  and Clos Bourel and Vauroque, and the great white devil reared to
  his fullest with wildly beating forefeet, toppled over backwards,
  and disappeared with one hideous thud and a final crash on the
  shingle of Coup&eacute;e Bay.</p>

  <p>It was worse than they had ever dreamed&mdash;as bad almost as
  some of Gard's own nightmares.</p>

  <p>"Good God! Good God! Good God!" babbled the Doctor, as he
  groped in the dark for what might be left of their unfortunate
  decoy.</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!" gasped the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, with catching breath and shaking legs, as
  he ran round to join him in the search.</p>

  <p>But there was no sign of Gard.</p>

  <p>"Run, man!&mdash;Plaisance&mdash;a light!" jerked the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal.</p>

  <p>"I can't see," groaned the Doctor.</p>

  <p>"I'll go!" and he set off at the best pace his years and his
  shaking legs could compass.</p>

  <p>Plaisance was standing at its doors, trembling still at that
  fearsome cry, and wondering if it was, perchance, the last
  trump.</p>

  <p>At sight of the panting figure coming up from the
  Coup&eacute;e, it scuttled and banged the doors tight. "Open!
  Open, you fools!" cried the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, and flung
  himself against the first door, while those inside, under the
  sure belief that they were keeping out the devil, heaped
  themselves against it to prevent him.</p>

  <p>"Dolts! Idiots! Fools!" he cried. "It's me&mdash;the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal. I want your help!" and at that a man
  peeped out from the next door to make sure this was not just
  another wile of the devil.</p>

  <p>"A lantern! Quick!" ordered the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal. "And a
  blanket and a rope&mdash;and get ready a bed for a wounded man.
  Come you with me and help!"</p>

  <p>"Mais, mon Gyu&mdash;&mdash;!" began the man.</p>

  <p>"We've killed the devil, and the Doctor's down there with
  him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But we don't want him here, M. le S&eacute;n&eacute;chal,"
  quavered a woman's voice, in terror.</p>

  <p>"Fools! It's Mr. Gard that is hurt. The devil's down in
  Coup&eacute;e Bay, and we've killed him for you."</p>

  <p>"Ah then, Gyu marchi! Here's a blanket&mdash;and the
  lantern&mdash;rope's in barn. You get a bed ready," to the woman,
  and they went off towards the Coup&eacute;e.</p>

  <p>And mighty glad the Doctor was to see them coming. He had
  begun to fear the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal had lost his head and
  made a bolt for home.</p>

  <p>He had been sitting under the bank of the cutting as the
  surest way of keeping out of one or other of the black gulfs. But
  the interval had given him time to recover himself, and he jumped
  up at once, all ready for business, and hailed them.</p>

  <p>"Down this side, I think," he said, and they swung the lantern
  over the Grande Gr&egrave;ve slope below the bit of crumbly
  pathway.</p>

  <p>"Le velas!" said Thomas Carr&eacute;, and handed the lantern
  to the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, and let himself heavily over the
  side, and groped his way down to the motionless form among the
  bramble bushes.</p>

  <p>"Pardie, he is dead, I do think!" as he bent over it.</p>

  <p>"Let's see!" said the Doctor's quick voice at his elbow. "Hand
  down the light;" and the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal waited above in
  grievous anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Not dead," said the Doctor at last. "Stunned and badly
  knocked about. He'll come round. Now, how are we to get him
  up?"</p>

  <p>"Here's a blanket&mdash;and a rope."</p>

  <p>"Good! The blanket!... So!... Now&mdash;gently, my man!... Got
  it, S&eacute;n&eacute;chal? Right! Ease him down on to the path.
  That's right! Give me a hand, will you? My legs aren't as limber
  as they used to be. Now we'll get him on to a bed and see what
  the damage is;" and they set off slowly for Plaisance.</p>

  <p>"My God, S&eacute;n&eacute;chal! That passed belief! To think
  of our never thinking of that infernal brute!" said the Doctor,
  as they stumbled slowly along in the joggling light.</p>

  <p>"He was possessed of the devil, without a doubt. That last
  scream of his when he got my two bullets&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'T woke us," said Carr&eacute;. "And we wondered what was up.
  What was it, then, monsieur?"</p>

  <p>"That devil of a white stallion of Le Pelley's. It was him
  killed Tom Hamon and Peter Mauger, and he tried to kill Mr. Gard.
  We've been on this job for weeks past, while you were all
  sleeping in your beds."</p>

  <p>"Mon Gyu! and we none of us knew anything about it till we
  heard yon scream! And he's dead&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's dead&mdash;unless he's the devil," said the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal sententiously.</p>

  XXXIX</h2>

  <h3>HOW THEY THANKED GOD FOR HIS MERCIES</h3>

  <p>Vast was the wonder of the Sark folk when they heard next day
  of that night's doings, and learned who the murderer of the
  Coup&eacute;e was, and how and by whom he had been laid by the
  heels.</p>

  <p>The whole Island breathed freely once more, and was
  outspokenly grateful to the courage and pertinacity which had
  lifted from it the cloud and the reproach.</p>

  <p>Some of them even had the grace to be not a little ashamed of
  their previous doings, but ascribed the greater part of the blame
  to Tom's widow and Peter Mauger.</p>

  <p>But it was days before Stephen Gard took any interest in the
  matter, past or present, or in anything whatsoever.</p>

  <p>The Doctor's pad undoubtedly saved his life, but no amount of
  padding could avert entirely the fiendish malignity of those
  merciless iron flails.</p>

  <p>He lay unconscious for eight-and-forty hours; and the
  Doctor&mdash;though he never breathed a word of it, and
  prophesied complete recovery with the utmost cheerfulness and
  apparent sincerity&mdash;had his own grim fears as to what the
  effect of the whole hideous event might be on one who had already
  suffered such undue strain of mind and body.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his fears proved groundless. On the third day,
  Gard quietly opened his eyes on Nance, who had barely left his
  bedside since the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal went down to La Closerie
  himself and brought her back with him to Plaisance.</p>

  <p>"I've been asleep," he said drowsily. "Anything wrong, Nance
  dear?" and he tried to sit up, but found his head heavy with cold
  water bandages, and a pain about his neck and left shoulder, and
  his left arm in splints, and all the rest of him one great aching
  bruise.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;" he murmured, in vast surprise.</p>

  <p>"You're to lie quite still," said Nance dictatorially, with
  lifted finger. "And you're not to talk or think till the Doctor
  comes."</p>

  <p>"Give me a kiss, then!"&mdash;good prima facie evidence, this,
  that his brain had suffered no permanent injury.</p>

  <p>"Well, he didn't say anything about that," and she bent over
  him and kissed him with a brimming flood of gratitude in her blue
  eyes, and he lay quiet for a time.</p>

  <p>"Is it dead?" he asked suddenly, with a reminiscent shudder
  which set all his bruises aching.</p>

  <p>"The white horse? Yes, Dieu merci, it's dead! But you're not
  to talk or think."</p>

  <p>"Give me another kiss, then!"&mdash;from which it was apparent
  that he knew very well what kind of medicine was best adapted to
  his ailments.</p>

  <p>The Doctor came down to see him the very first thing every
  morning, and now he came quietly in, just as Nance had been
  administering her latest dose.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;ha, nurse! What are you doing to my patient!"</p>

  <p>"I'm only keeping him quiet, sir, as you told me to," said
  Nance, with a rosy face.</p>

  <p>"It's the doctor you ought to pay, not the patient. Well, my
  boy, how are we this morning? Head aching yet?"</p>

  <p>"It does feel a bit queer. Tell me all about last night,
  Doctor!"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;ha, yes&mdash;last night! Well, you caught the
  murderer with a vengeance, my boy&mdash;or he caught
  you,"&mdash;and then, seeing the puzzlement in the tired eyes, he
  briefly explained the whole matter.</p>

  <p>"And do you mean it was that awful beast killed the
  others?"</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt&mdash;and would have killed you in exactly
  the same way, and exactly the same place, but for my pads and the
  S&eacute;n&eacute;chal's bullets. Queer thing&mdash;they found
  the brute lying all in a heap in Coup&eacute;e Bay on the very
  spot where Tom Hamon and Peter Mauger were found."</p>

  <p>"Ay-y-y-y-y!" breathed Gard, with a long sigh of relief and a
  shiver. "I shall never forget him."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, you will&mdash;in time. Think of little Nance here.
  She's a sight better worth thinking of. And now, Miss Nancy, how
  much good news can you stand all at once, if you try your very
  hardest?" he asked, with a sparkle in his eyes that somehow
  seemed to set hers sparkling too.</p>

  <p>"Oh mad&eacute;, Doctor!" and the little hands clasped up on
  her breast, as was her way when greatly moved.
  "Not&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>She dared not hope for so much&mdash;the wish of her
  heart&mdash;just an inch or so behind the desire for Gard's
  recovery.</p>

  <p>"The cutter this morning brought over one we had feared was
  lost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not&mdash;not Bernel?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my child, Bernel, by God's good mercy! He was picked up
  by a Granville trawler, and lay there ill for some days, and
  could only get back by Jersey and Guernsey. He was to come along
  with the S&eacute;n&eacute;chal in a quarter of an
  hour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Nance had fallen on her knees and buried her face in the
  bed-clothes, lest any but God should see it in the rapture of its
  breaking.</p>

  <p>"Dieu merci! Dieu merci! Dieu merci!" she was crying, though
  none of them heard it.</p>

  <p>And "Thank God!" said Stephen Gard with fervour&mdash;for
  Bernel, and for himself, but most of all for Nance.</p>

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
