<br>
<p>Having followed Titian as far as the year 1530, rendered memorable
by
that sensational, and, of its kind, triumphant achievement, <i>The
Martyrdom
of St. Peter the Dominican</i>, we must retrace our steps some three
years in
order to dwell a little upon an incident which must appear of vital
importance
to those who seek to understand Titian's life, and, above all, to
follow the development of his art during the middle period of splendid
maturity reaching to the confines of old age. This incident is the
meeting
with Pietro Aretino at Venice in 1527, and the gradual strengthening
by mutual service and mutual inclination of the bonds of a friendship
which is to endure without break until the life of the Aretine comes,
many years later, to a sudden and violent end. Titian was at that time
fifty years of age, and he might thus be deemed to have over-passed
the age of sensuous delights. Yet it must be remembered that he
was in the fullest vigour of manhood, and had only then arrived at the
middle point of a career which, in its untroubled serenity, was to
endure
for a full half-century more, less a single year. Three years later on,
that
<a name="Page_6"></a>is to say in the middle of August 1530, the death
of his wife Cecilia, who
had borne to him Pomponio, Orazio, and Lavinia, left him all
disconsolate,
and so embarrassed with the cares of his young family that he was
compelled to appeal to his sister Orsa, who thereupon came from Cadore
to preside over his household. The highest point of celebrity, of
favour
with princes and magnates, having been attained, and a certain royalty
in
Venetian art being already conceded to him, there was no longer any
obstacle to the organising of a life in which all the refinements of
culture
and all the delights of sense were to form the most agreeable relief to
days of continuous and magnificently fruitful labour. It is just
because
Titian's art of this great period of some twenty years so entirely
accords
with what we know, and may legitimately infer, to have been his life at
this time, that it becomes important to consider the friendship with
Aretino and the rise of the so-called Triumvirate, which was a kind of
Council of Three, having as its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> the mutual
furtherance of
material interests, and the pursuit of art, love, and pleasure. The
third
member of the Triumvirate was Jacopo Tatti or del Sansovino, the
Florentine sculptor, whose fame and fortune were so far above his
deserts
as an artist. Coming to Venice after the sack of Rome, which so
entirely
for the moment disorganised art and artists in the pontifical city, he
elected to remain there notwithstanding the pressing invitations sent
to
him by Francis the First to take service with him. In 1529 he was
appointed architect of San Marco, and he then by his adhesion completed
the Triumvirate which was to endure for more than a quarter of a
century.</p>
<p>It has always excited a certain sense of distrust in Titian, and
caused
the world to form a lower estimate of his character than it would
otherwise
have done, that he should have been capable of thus living in the
closest and most fraternal intimacy with a man so spotted and in many
ways so infamous as Aretino. Without precisely calling Titian to
account in set terms, his biographers Crowe and Cavalcaselle, and above
all M. Georges Lafenestre in <i>La Vie et L'Oeuvre du Titien</i>, have
relentlessly
raked up Aretino's past before he came together with the Cadorine,
and as pitilessly laid bare that organised system of professional
sycophancy,
adulation, scurrilous libel, and blackmail, which was the foundation
and
the backbone of his life of outward pomp and luxurious ease at Venice.
<a name="Page_7"></a>By them, as by his other biographers, he has been
judged, not indeed
unjustly, yet perhaps too much from the standard of our own time, too
little from that of his own. With all his infamies, Aretino was a man
whom sovereigns and princes, nay even pontiffs, delighted to honour, or
rather to distinguish by honours. The Marquess Federigo Gonzaga of
Mantua, the Duke Guidobaldo II. of Urbino, among many others,
showed themselves ready to propitiate him; and such a man as Titian
the worldly-wise, the lover of splendid living to whom ample means and
the fruitful favour of the great were a necessity; who was grasping yet
not avaricious, who loved wealth chiefly because it secured material
consideration and a life of serene enjoyment; such a man could not
be expected to rise superior to the temptations presented by a
friendship
with Aretino, or to despise the immense advantages which it included.
As he is revealed by his biographers, and above all by himself, Aretino
was essentially "good company." He could pass off his most flagrant
misdeeds, his worst sallies, with a certain large and Rabelaisian
gaiety;
if he made money his chief god, it was to spend it in magnificent
clothes
and high living, but also at times with an intelligent and even a
beneficent
liberality. He was a fine though not an unerring connoisseur of
art, he had a passionate love of music, and an unusually exquisite
perception of the beauties of Nature.</p>
<p>To hint that the lower nature of the man corrupted that of Titian,
and exercised a disintegrating influence over his art, would be to go
far
beyond the requirements of the case. The great Venetian, though he
might at this stage be much nearer to earth than in those early days
when he was enveloped in the golden glow of Giorgione's overmastering
influence, could never have lowered himself to the level of those too
famous <i>Sonetti Lussuriosi</i> which brought down the vengeance of
even a
Medici Pope (Clement VII.) upon Aretino the writer, Giulio Romano
the illustrator, and Marcantonio Raimondi the engraver. Gracious and
dignified in sensuousness he always remained even when, as at this
middle stage of his career, the vivifying shafts of poetry no longer
pierced through, and transmuted with their vibration of true passion,
the
fair realities of life. He could never have been guilty of the frigid
and
calculated indecency of a Giulio Romano; he could not have cast aside
all conventional restraints, of taste as well as of propriety, as
Rubens and
<a name="Page_8"></a>even Rembrandt did on occasion; but as Van Dyck,
the child of Titian
almost as much as he was the child of Rubens, ever shrank from doing.
Still the ease and splendour of the life at Biri Grande&#8212;that pleasant
abode with its fair gardens overlooking Murano, the Lagoons, and the
Friulan Alps, to which Titian migrated in 1531&#8212;the Epicureanism which
saturated the atmosphere, the necessity for keeping constantly in view
the material side of life, all these things operated to colour the
creations
which mark this period of Titian's practice, at which he has reached
the
apex of pictorial achievement, but shows himself too serene in
sensuousness,
too unruffled in the masterly practice of his profession to give to the
heart the absolute satisfaction that he affords to the eyes. This is
the
greatest test of genius of the first order&#8212;to preserve undimmed in
mature
manhood and old age the gift of imaginative interpretation which youth
and love give, or lend, to so many who, buoyed up by momentary
inspiration,
are yet not to remain permanently in the first rank. With Titian at
this time supreme ability is not invariably illumined from within by
the
lamp of genius; the light flashes forth nevertheless, now and again,
and
most often in those portraits of men of which the sublime <i>Charles
V. at
M&uuml;hlberg</i> is the greatest. Towards the end the flame will rise
once
more and steadily burn, with something on occasion of the old heat, but
with a hue paler and more mysterious, such as may naturally be the
outward symbol of genius on the confines of eternity.</p>
<p>The second period, following upon the completion of the <i>St.
Peter
Martyr</i>, is one less of great altar-pieces and <i>poesie</i> such
as the miscalled
<i>Sacred and Profane Love</i> (<i>Medea and Venus</i>), the <i>Bacchanals</i>,
and the
<i>Bacchus and Ariadne</i>, than it is of splendid nudities and great
portraits.
In the former, however mythological be the subject, it is generally
chosen
but to afford a decent pretext for the generous display of beauty
unveiled.
The portraits are at this stage less often intimate and soul-searching
in
their summing up of a human personality than they are official
presentments
of great personages and noble dames; showing them, no doubt,
without false adulation or cheap idealisation, yet much as they desire
to appear to their allies, their friends, and their subjects, sovereign
in
natural dignity and aristocratic grace, yet essentially in a moment of
representation. Farther on the great altar-pieces reappear more sombre,
more agitated in passion, as befits the period of the sixteenth century
in
<a name="Page_9"></a>which Titian's latest years are passed, and the
patrons for whom he paints.
Of the <i>poesie</i> there is then a new upspringing, a new
efflorescence, and
we get by the side of the <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, the <i>Diana and
Act&aelig;on</i>,
the <i>Diana and Calisto</i>, the <i>Rape of Europa</i>, such pieces
of a more
exquisite and penetrating poetry as the <i>Venere del Pardo</i> of
Paris,
and the <i>Nymph and Shepherd</i> of Vienna.</p>
<p>This appears to be the right place to say a word about the
magnificent
engraving by Van Dalen of a portrait, no longer known to exist, but
which has, upon the evidence apparently of the print, been put down as
that of Titian by himself. It represents a bearded man of some
thirty-five
years, dressed in a rich but sombre habit, and holding a book. The
portrait is evidently not that of a painter by himself, nor does it
represent
Titian at any age; but it finely suggests, even in black and white, a
noble
original by the master. Now, a comparison with the best authenticated
portrait of Aretino, the superb three-quarter length painted in 1545,
and
actually at the Pitti Palace, reveals certain marked similarities of
feature
and type, notwithstanding the very considerable difference of age
between
the personages represented. Very striking is the agreement of eye and
nose in either case, while in the younger as in the older man we note
an
idiosyncrasy in which vigorous intellect as well as strong sensuality
has full play. Van Dalen's engraving very probably reproduces one of
the lost portraits of Aretino by Titian. In Crowe and Cavalcaselle's
<i>Biography</i> (vol. i. pp. 317-319) we learn from correspondence
interchanged
in the summer of 1527 between Federigo Gonzaga, Titian, and
Aretino, that the painter, in order to propitiate the Mantuan ruler,
sent
to him with a letter, the exaggerated flattery of which savours of
Aretino's
precept and example, portraits of the latter and of Signor Hieronimo
Adorno, another "faithful servant" of the Marquess. Now Aretino was
born in 1492, so that in 1527 he would be thirty-five, which appears to
be just about the age of the vigorous and splendid personage in Van
Dalen's print.</p>
<p>Some reasons were given in the former section of this monograph<a
 name="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> for
the assertion that the <i>Madonna with St. Catherine</i>, mentioned in
a letter
from Giacomo Malatesta to the Marchese Federigo Gonzaga, dated
February 1530, was not, as is assumed by Crowe and Cavalcaselle, the
<a name="Page_10"></a><i>Madonna del Coniglio</i> of the Louvre, but
the <i>Madonna and Child with
St. John the Baptist and St. Catherine</i>, which is No. 635 at the
National
Gallery.<a name="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
Few pictures of the master have been more frequently copied
and adapted than this radiantly beautiful piece, in which the dominant
chord of the scheme of colour is composed by the cerulean blues of the
heavens and the Virgin's entire dress, the deep luscious greens of the
landscape, and the peculiar, pale, citron hue, relieved with a crimson
girdle, of the robe worn by the St. Catherine, a splendid Venetian
beauty
of no very refined type or emotional intensity. Perfect repose and
serenity
are the keynote of the conception, which in its luxuriant beauty has
little
of the power to touch that must be conceded to the more na&iuml;ve and
equally splendid <i>Madonna del Coniglio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> It is above all in the wonderful
Venetian landscape&#8212;a mountain-bordered vale, along which flocks and
herds are being driven, under a sky of the most intense blue&#8212;that the
master shows himself supreme. Nature is therein not so much detailed
as synthesised with a sweeping breadth which makes of the scene not the
reflection of one beautiful spot in the Venetian territory, but without
loss
of essential truth or character a very type of Venetian landscape of
the
sixteenth century. These herdsmen and their flocks, and also the note
of warning in the sky of supernatural splendour, recall the beautiful
Venetian storm-landscape in the royal collection at Buckingham Palace.
This has been very generally attributed to Titian himself,<a
 name="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and
described
as the only canvas still extant in which he has made landscape his one
and
only theme. It has, indeed, a rare and mysterious power to move, a true
<a name="Page_11"></a>poetry of interpretation. A fleeting moment, full
of portent as well as of
beauty, has been seized; the smile traversed by a frown of the stormy
sky,
half overshadowing half revealing the wooded slopes, the rich plain,
and the
distant mountains, is rendered with a rare felicity. The beauty is, all
the
same, in the conception and in the thing actually seen&#8212;much less in the
actual painting. It is hardly possible to convince oneself, comparing
the
work with such landscape backgrounds as those in this picture at the
National Gallery in the somewhat earlier <i>Madonna del Coniglio</i>,
and
the gigantic <i>St. Peter Martyr</i>, or, indeed, in a score of other
genuine
productions, that the depth, the vigour, the authority of Titian
himself are
here to be recognised. The weak treatment of the great Titianesque tree
in the foreground, with its too summarily indicated foliage&#8212;to select
only one detail that comes naturally to hand&#8212;would in itself suffice to
bring such an attribution into question.</p>

<p>Vasari states, speaking confessedly from hearsay, that in 1530, the
Emperor Charles V. being at Bologna, Titian was summoned thither by
<a name="Page_12"></a>Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici, using Aretino as an
intermediary, and that
he on that occasion executed a most admirable portrait of His Majesty,
all in arms, which had so much success that the artist received as a
present a thousand scudi. Crowe and Cavalcaselle, however, adduce
strong evidence to prove that Titian was busy in Venice for
Federigo Gonzaga at the time of the Emperor's first visit, and that he
only proceeded to Bologna in July to paint for the Marquess of Mantua
the portrait of a Bolognese beauty, <i>La Cornelia</i>, the
lady-in-waiting of
the Countess Pepoli, whom Covas, the all-powerful political secretary
of
Charles the Fifth, had seen and admired at the splendid entertainments
given by the Pepoli to the Emperor. Vasari has in all probability
confounded this journey of Charles in 1530 with that subsequent one
undertaken in 1532 when Titian not only portrayed the Emperor, but
also painted an admirable likeness of Ippolito de' Medici presently to
be
described. He had the bad luck on this occasion to miss the lady
Cornelia, who had retired to Nuvolara, indisposed and not in good face.
The letter written by our painter to the Marquess in connection with
this
incident<a name="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
is chiefly remarkable as affording evidence of his too great
anxiety to portray the lady without approaching her, relying merely on
the portrait, "che fece quel altro pittore della detta Cornelia"; of
his
unwillingness to proceed to Nuvolara, unless the picture thus done at
second hand should require alteration. In truth we have lighted here
upon one of Titian's most besetting sins, this willingness, this
eagerness,
when occasion offers, to paint portraits without direct reference
to the model. In this connection we are reminded that he never
saw Francis the First, whose likeness he notwithstanding painted with
so showy and superficial a magnificence as to make up to the casual
observer for the absence of true vitality;<a name="FNanchor_6"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> that the Empress Isabella,
Charles V.'s consort, when at the behest of the monarch he produced her
sumptuous but lifeless and empty portrait, now in the great gallery of
the Prado, was long since dead. He consented, basing his picture
upon a likeness of much earlier date, to paint Isabella d'Este Gonzaga
as
a young woman when she was already an old one, thereby flattering an
amiable and natural weakness in this great princess and unrivalled
<a name="Page_13"></a>dilettante, but impairing his own position as an
artist of supreme rank.<a name="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
It is not necessary to include in this category the popular <i>Caterina
Cornaro</i> of the Uffizi, since it is confessedly nothing but a fancy
portrait,
making no reference to the true aspect at any period of the long-since
deceased queen of Cyprus, and, what is more, no original Titian, but at
the utmost an atelier piece from his <i>entourage</i>. Take, however,
as an
instance the <i>Francis the First</i>, which was painted some few
years later
than the time at which we have now arrived, and at about the same
period
as the <i>Isabella d'Este</i>. Though as a <i>portrait d'apparat</i>
it makes its effect,
and reveals the sovereign accomplishment of the master, does it not
shrink into the merest insignificance when compared with such
renderings
from life as the successive portraits of <i>Charles the Fifth</i>, the
<i>Ippolito de'
Medici</i>, the <i>Francesco Maria della Rovere</i>? This is as it
must and
should be, and Titian is not the less great, but the greater, because
he
cannot convincingly evolve at second hand the true human individuality,
physical and mental, of man or woman.</p>
<p>It was in the earlier part of 1531 that Titian painted for Federigo
Gonzaga a <i>St. Jerome</i> and a <i>St. Mary Magdalene</i>, destined
for the famous
Vittoria Colonna, Marchioness of Pescara, who had expressed to the
ruler of Mantua the desire to possess such a picture. Gonzaga writes to
the Marchioness on March 11, 1831<a name="FNanchor_8"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>:&#8212;"Ho subito mandate a Venezia
e scritto a Titiano, quale &egrave; forse il piu eccellente in quell'
arte che a nostri
tempi si ritrovi, ed &egrave; tutto mio, ricercandolo con grande
instantia a
volerne fare una bella lagrimosa piu che si so puo, e farmela haver
presto."
The passage is worth quoting as showing the estimation in which Titian
was held at a court which had known and still knew the greatest Italian
masters of the art.</p>
<p>It is not possible at present to identify with any extant painting
the
<i>St. Jerome</i>, of which we know that it hung in the private
apartments
<a name="Page_14"></a>of the Marchioness Isabella at Mantua. The writer
is unable to
accept Crowe and Cavalcaselle's suggestion that it may be the fine
moonlight landscape with St. Jerome in prayer which is now in the
Long Gallery of the Louvre. This piece, if indeed it be by Titian,
which is by no means certain, must belong to his late time. The
landscape, which is marked by a beautiful and wholly unconventional
treatment of moonlight, for which it would not be easy to find a
parallel
in the painting of the time, is worthy of the Cadorine, and agrees
well,
especially in the broad treatment of foliage, with, for instance, the
background in the late <i>Venus and Cupid</i> of the Tribuna.<a
 name="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> The
figure
of St. Jerome, on the other hand, does not in the peculiar tightness of
the modelling, or in the flesh-tints, recall Titian's masterly
synthetic way
of going to work in works of this late period. The noble <i>St. Jerome</i>
of
the Brera, which indubitably belongs to a well-advanced stage in the
late
time, will be dealt with in its right place. Though it does not appear
probable that we have, in the much-admired <i>Magdalen</i> of the
Pitti,
the picture here referred to&#8212;this last having belonged to Francesco
Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, and representing, to judge by
style, a somewhat more advanced period in the painter's career&#8212;it
may be convenient to mention it here. As an example of accomplished
brush-work, of handling careful and yet splendid in breadth, it is
indeed
worthy of all admiration. The colours of the fair human body, the
marvellous wealth of golden blond hair, the youthful flesh glowing
semi-transparent, and suggesting the rush of the blood beneath; these
are also the colours of the picture, aided only by the indefinite
landscape
and the deep blue sky of the background. If this were to be
accepted as the <i>Magdalen</i> painted for Federigo Gonzaga, we must
hold, nevertheless, that Titian with his masterpiece of painting only
half satisfied the requirements of his patron. <i>Bellissima</i> this
Magdalen
undoubtedly is, but hardly <i>lagrimosa pin che si puo</i>. She is a <i>belle
p&eacute;cheresse</i> whose repentance sits all too lightly upon her,
whose consciousness
of a physical charm not easily to be withstood is hardly disguised.
<a name="Page_15"></a>Somehow, although the picture in no way oversteps
the bounds of decency, and cannot be objected to even by the most
over-scrupulous, there is latent in it a jarring note of unrefinement
in the presentment of exuberant youth and beauty which we do not find
in the more avowedly sensuous <i>Venus of the Tribuna</i>. This last
is an avowed act of worship by the artist of the naked human body, and
as such, in its noble frankness, free from all offence, except to those
whose scruples in matters of art we are not here called upon to
consider. From this <i>Magdalen</i> to that much later
one of the Hermitage, which will be described farther on, is a great
step upwards, and it is a step which, in passing from the middle to
the last period, we shall more than once find ourselves taking.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give even in outline here an account of Titian's
correspondence and business relations with his noble and royal patrons,
instructive as it is to follow these out, and to see how, under the
influence of Aretino, his natural eagerness to grasp in every direction
at material advantages is sharpened; how he becomes at once more humble
and more pressing, covering with the manner and the tone appropriate to
courts the reiterated demands of the keen and indefatigable man of
business. It is the less necessary to attempt any such account in these
pages&#8212;dealing as we are chiefly with the work and not primarily with
the life of Titian&#8212;seeing that in Crowe and Cavalcaselle's admirable
biography this side of the subject, among many others, is most
patiently and exhaustively dealt with.</p>
<p>In 1531 we read of a <i>Boy Baptist</i> by Titian sent by Aretino
to
Maximian Stampa, an imperialist partisan in command of the castle of
Milan. The donor particularly dwells upon "the beautiful curl of the
Baptist's hair, the fairness of his skin, etc.," a description which
recalls to us, in striking fashion, the little St. John in the <i>Virgin
and Child with St. Catherine</i> of the National Gallery, which
belongs, as has been shown, to the same time.</p>
<p>It was on the occasion of the second visit of the Emperor and his
court to Bologna at the close of 1532 that Titian first came in
personal contact with Charles V., and obtained from that monarch his
first sitting. In the course of an inspection, with Federigo Gonzaga
himself as cicerone, of the art treasures preserved in the palace at
Mantua, the Emperor saw the portrait by Titian of Federigo, and was so
much struck
<a name="Page_16"></a>with it, so intent upon obtaining a portrait of
himself from the same
brush, that the Marquess wrote off at once pressing our master to join
him without delay in his capital. Titian preferred, however, to go
direct to Bologna in the train of his earlier patron Alfonso d'Este.
It was on this occasion that Charles's all-powerful secretary, the
greedy, overbearing Covos, exacted as a gift from the agents of the
Duke of Ferrara, among other things, a portrait of Alfonso himself by
Titian; and in all probability obtained also a portrait from the same
hand of Ercole d'Este, the heir-apparent. There is evidence to show
that the portrait of Alfonso was at once handed over to, or
appropriated by, the Emperor.</p>
<p>Whether this was the picture described by Vasari as representing the
prince with his arm resting on a great piece of artillery, does not
appear. Of this last a copy exists in the Pitti Gallery which Crowe and
Cavalcaselle have ascribed to Dosso Dossi, but the original is nowhere
to be traced. The Ferrarese ruler is, in this last canvas, depicted as
a man of forty or upwards, of resolute and somewhat careworn aspect. It
has already been demonstrated, on evidence furnished by Herr Carl
Justi, that the supposed portrait of Alfonso, in the gallery of the
Prado at Madrid, cannot possibly represent Titian's patron at any stage
of his career, but in all
probability, like the so-called <i>Giorgio Cornaro</i> of Castle
Howard, is a likeness of his son and successor, Ercole II.</p>
<p>Titian's first portrait of the Emperor, a full-length in which he
appeared in armour with a generalissimo's baton of command, was taken
in 1556 from Brussels to Madrid, after the formal ceremony of
abdication, and perished, it would appear, in one of the too numerous
fires which have devastated from time to time the royal palaces of the
Spanish capital and its neighbourhood. To the same period belongs, no
doubt, the noble full-length of Charles in gala court costume which now
hangs in the <i>Sala de la Reina Isabel</i> in the Prado Gallery, as a
pendant to Titian's portrait of Philip II. in youth. Crowe and
Cavalcaselle assume that not this picture, but a replica, was the one
which found its way into Charles I.'s collection, and was there
catalogued by Van der Doort as "the Emperor Charles the Fifth, brought
by the king from Spain, being done at length with a big white Irish
dog"&#8212;going afterwards, at the dispersal of the king's effects,
to Sir Balthasar Gerbier for <i>&pound;</i>150. There is, however, no
valid reason for doubting that this is the very picture owned for a
time by Charles I., and
<a name="Page_17"></a>which busy intriguing Gerbier afterwards bought,
only to part with it to
Cardenas the Spanish ambassador.<a name="FNanchor_10"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Other famous originals by
Titian were
among the choicest gifts made by Philip IV. to Prince Charles at the
time
of his runaway expedition to Madrid with the Duke of Buckingham, and
this was no doubt among them. Confirmation is supplied by the fact
that the references to the existence of this picture in the royal
palaces of
Madrid are for the reigns of Philip II., Charles II., and Charles III.,
thus
leaving a large gap unaccounted for. Dimmed as the great portrait is,
robbed of its glow and its chastened splendour in a variety of ways, it
is
still a rare example of the master's unequalled power in rendering
race,
the unaffected consciousness of exalted rank, natural as distinguished
from
assumed dignity. There is here no demonstrative assertion of <i>grandeza</i>,
no menacing display of truculent authority, but an absolutely serene
and
simple attitude such as can only be the outcome of a consciousness of
supreme rank and responsibility which it can never have occurred to any
one to call into question. To see and perpetuate these subtle
qualities,
which go so far to redeem the physical drawbacks of the House of
Hapsburg,
the painter must have had a peculiar instinct for what is aristocratic
in the higher sense of the word&#8212;that is, both outwardly and inwardly
distinguished. This was indeed one of the leading characteristics of
Titian's great art, more especially in portraiture. Giorgione went
deeper,
knowing the secret of the soul's refinement, the aristocracy of poetry
and
passion; Lotto sympathetically laid bare the heart's secrets and showed
the pathetic helplessness of humanity. Tintoretto communicated his own
savage grandeur, his own unrest, to those whom he depicted; Paolo
Veronese charmed without <i>arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e</i> by the
intensity of vitality
which with perfect simplicity he preserved in his sitters. Yet to
Titian
must be conceded absolute supremacy in the rendering not only of the
outward but of the essential dignity, the refinement of type and
bearing,
which without doubt come unconsciously to those who can boast a noble
and illustrious ancestry.</p>
<p>Again the writer hesitates to agree with Crowe and Cavalcaselle
when they place at this period, that is to say about 1533, the
superb <i>Allegory</i> of the Louvre (No. 1589), which is very
generally
believed to represent the famous commander Alfonso d'Avalos,
<a name="Page_18"></a>Marqu&eacute;s del Vasto, with his family. The
eminent biographers
of Titian connect the picture with the return of d'Avalos from the
campaign against the Turks, undertaken by him in the autumn of 1532,
under the leadership of Croy, at the behest of his imperial master.
They
hazard the surmise that the picture, though painted after Alfonso's
return, symbolises his departure for the wars, "consoled by Victory,
Love, and Hymen." A more natural conclusion would surely be that
what Titian has sought to suggest is the return of the commander to
enjoy the hard-earned fruits of victory.</p>

<p>The Italo-Spanish grandee was born at Naples in 1502, so that at
this date he would have been but thirty-one years of age, whereas the
mailed warrior of the <i>Allegory</i> is at least forty, perhaps
older. Moreover,
and this is the essential point, the technical qualities of the
picture,
the wonderful easy mastery of the handling, the peculiarities of the
colouring and the general tone, surely point to a rather later date, to
a
period, indeed, some ten years ahead of the time at which we have
arrived.
If we are to accept the tradition that this Allegory, or
quasi-allegorical
portrait-piece, giving a fanciful embodiment to the pleasures of
martial
domination, of conjugal love, of well-earned peace and plenty,
represents
d'Avalos, his consort Mary of Arragon, and their family&#8212;and a
comparison with the well-authenticated portrait of Del Vasto in the
<i>Allocution</i> of Madrid does not carry with it entire conviction&#8212;we
must perforce place the Louvre picture some ten years later than do
Crowe and Cavalcaselle. Apart from the question of identification,
it appears to the writer that the technical execution of the piece
would
lead to a similar conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_11"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>
<p>To this year, 1533, belongs one of the masterpieces in portraiture
of our painter, the wonderful <i>Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici in a
Hungarian
habit</i> of the Pitti. This youthful Prince of the Church, the natural
<a name="Page_19"></a>son of Giuliano de' Medici, Duke of Nemours, was
born in 1511, so
that when Titian so incomparably portrayed him, he was, for all the
perfect maturity of his virile beauty, for all the perfect
self-possession
of his aspect, but twenty-two years of age. He was the passionate
worshipper of the divine Giulia Gonzaga, whose portrait he caused to
be painted by Sebastiano del Piombo. His part in the war undertaken
by Charles V. in 1532, against the Turks, had been a strange one.
<a name="Page_20"></a>Clement VII., his relative, had appointed him
Legate and sent him to
Vienna at the head of three hundred musketeers. But when Charles
withdrew from the army to return to Italy, the Italian contingent,
instead of going in pursuit of the Sultan into Hungary, opportunely
mutinied, thus affording to their pleasure-loving leader the desired
pretext for riding back with them through the Austrian provinces,
with eyes wilfully closed the while to their acts of depredation.
<a name="Page_21"></a>It was in the rich and fantastic habit of a
Hungarian captain that
the handsome young Medici was now painted by Titian at Bologna,
the result being a portrait unique of its kind even in his life-work.
The sombre glow of the supple, youthful flesh, the red-brown
of the rich velvet habit which defines the perfect shape of Ippolito,
the
<a name="Page_22"></a>red of the fantastic plumed head-dress worn by
him with such sovereign
ease, make up a deep harmony, warm, yet not in the technical sense hot,
and of indescribable effect. And this effect is centralised in the
uncanny
glance, the mysterious aspect of the man whom, as we see him here,
a woman might love for his beauty, but a man would do well to distrust.
The smaller portrait painted by Titian about the same time of the young
Cardinal fully armed&#8212;the one which, with the Pitti picture, Vasari saw
in
the closet (<i>guardaroba</i>) of Cosimo, Duke of Tuscany&#8212;is not now
known
to exist.<a name="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p>It may be convenient to mention here one of the most magnificent
among the male portraits of Titian, the <i>Young Nobleman</i> in the
Sala di
Marte of the Pitti Gallery, although its exact place in the middle time
of
the artist it is, failing all data on the point, not easy to determine.
At
Florence there has somehow been attached to it the curious name <i>Howard
duca di Norfolk</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
but upon what grounds, if any, the writer is unable to
state. The master of Cadore never painted a head more finely or with a
more exquisite finesse, never more happily characterised a face, than
that of
this resolute, self-contained young patrician with the curly chestnut
hair and
the short, fine beard and moustache&#8212;a personage high of rank,
doubtless,
notwithstanding the studied simplicity of his dress. Because we know
nothing of the sitter, and there is in his pose and general aspect
nothing
sensational, this masterpiece is, if not precisely not less celebrated
among
connoisseurs, at any rate less popular with the larger public, than it
deserves to be.<a name="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="Page_24"></a>The noble altar-piece in the church of S.
Giovanni Elemosinario at
Venice showing the saint of that name enthroned, and giving alms to a
beggar, belongs to the close of 1533 or thereabouts, since the
high-altar
was finished in the month of October of that year. According to Vasari,
it
must be regarded as having served above all to assert once for all the
supremacy of Titian over Pordenone, whose friends had obtained for him
the commission to paint in competition with the Cadorine an altar-piece
for
one of the apsidal chapels of the church, where, indeed, his work is
still to
be seen.<a name="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
Titian's canvas, like most of the great altar-pieces of the middle
time, was originally arched at the top; but the vandalism of a
subsequent
epoch has, as in the case of the <i>Madonna di S. Niccola</i>, now in
the Vatican, made of this arch a square, thereby greatly impairing the
majesty of the general effect. Titian here solves the problem of
combining
the strong and simple decorative aspect demanded by the position
of the work as the central feature of a small church, with the utmost
pathos and dignity, thus doing incomparably in his own way&#8212;the way
of the colourist and the warm, the essentially human realist&#8212;what
Michelangelo had, soaring high above earth, accomplished with
unapproachable
sublimity in the <i>Prophets</i> and <i>Sibyls</i> of the Sixtine
Chapel.</p>
<p>The colour is appropriately sober, yet a general tone is produced of
great
strength and astonishing effectiveness. The illumination is that of the
open
air, tempered and modified by an overhanging canopy of green; the great
effect is obtained by the brilliant grayish white of the saint's alb,
dominating
and keeping in due balance the red of the rochet and the under-robes,
the cloud-veiled sky, the marble throne or podium, the dark green
hanging. This picture must have had in the years to follow a strong and
lasting influence on Paolo Veronese, the keynote to whose audaciously
<a name="Page_25"></a>brilliant yet never over-dazzling colour is this
use of white and gray in large
dominating masses. The noble figure of S. Giovanni gave him a prototype
for many of his imposing figures of bearded old men. There
is a strong reminiscence, too, of the saint's attitude in one of the
most
wonderful of extant Veroneses&#8212;that sumptuous altar-piece <i>SS.
Anthony,
Cornelius, and Cyprian with a Page</i>, in the Brera, for which he
invented
a harmony as delicious as it is daring, composed wholly of
violet-purple,
green, and gold.</p>

<br>
<p>Within the years 1532 and 1538, or thereabouts, would appear to fall
Titian's relations with another princely patron, Francesco Maria della
Rovere, Duke of Urbino, the nephew of the redoubtable Pope Julius II.,
whose qualities of martial ardour and unbridled passion he reproduced
in
an exaggerated form. By his mother, Giovanna da Montefeltro, he
descended also from the rightful dynasty of Urbino, to which he
succeeded
in virtue of adoption. His life of perpetual strife, of warfare in
defence of his more than once lost and reconquered duchy, and as the
captain first of the army of the Church, afterwards of the Venetian
forces,
came to an abrupt end in 1538. With his own hand he had, in the
ardent days of his youth, slain in the open streets of Ravenna the
handsome,
sinister Cardinal Alidosi, thereby bringing down upon himself the
anathemas of his uncle, Julius II., and furnishing to his successor,
the
Medici pope Leo X., the best possible excuse for the sequestration of
the
duchy of Urbino in favour of his own house. He himself died by poison,
suspicion resting upon the infamous Pier Luigi Farnese, the son of
Paul III.</p>
<p>Francesco Maria had espoused Eleonora Gonzaga, the sister of
Titian's protector, Federigo, and it is probably through the latter
that
the relations with our master sprang up to which we owe a small group
<a name="Page_27"></a><a name="Page_28"></a>of his very finest works,
including the so-called <i>Venus of Urbino</i> of the
Tribuna, the <i>Girl in a Fur Cloak</i> of the Vienna Gallery, and the
companion portraits of Francesco Maria and Eleonora which are now in
the
Venetian Gallery at the Uffizi. The fiery leader of armies had, it
should
be remembered, been brought up by Guidobaldo of Montefeltro, one of
the most amiable and enlightened princes of his time, and, moreover,
his
consort Eleonora was the daughter of Isabella d'Este Gonzaga, than
whom the Renaissance knew no more enthusiastic or more discriminating
patron of art.</p>

 title="The Girl in the Fur Cloak. Imperial Gallery, Vienna. From a Photograph by L&ouml;wy."
 src="images/image09.jpg"></p>
<p>A curious problem meets us at the outset. We may assume with
some degree of certainty that the portraits of the duke and duchess
belong to the year 1537. Stylistic characteristics point to the
conclusion
that the great <i>Venus</i> of the Tribuna, the so-called <i>Bella di
Tiziano</i>, and
the <i>Girl in the Fur Cloak</i>&#8212;to take only undoubted
originals&#8212;belong to
much the same stage of Titian's practice as the companion portraits at
the Uffizi. Eleonora Gonzaga, a princess of the highest culture, the
daughter of an admirable mother, the friend of Pietro Bembo, Sadolet,
and Baldassarre Castiglione, was at this time a matron of some twenty
years' standing; at the date when her avowed portrait was painted she
must have been at the very least forty. By what magic did Titian
manage to suggest her type and physiognomy in the famous pictures just
now mentioned, and yet to plunge the duchess into a kind of <i>Fontaine
de
Jouvence</i>, realising in the divine freshness of youth and beauty
beings who
nevertheless appear to have with her some kind of mystic and unsolved
connection? If this was what he really intended&#8212;and the results
attained
may lead us without temerity to assume as much&#8212;no subtler or more
exquisite form of flattery could be conceived. It is curious to note
that
at the same time he signally failed with the portrait of her mother,
Isabella d'Este, painted in 1534, but showing the Marchioness of Mantua
as a young woman of some twenty-five years, though she was then sixty.
Here youth and a semblance of beauty are called up by the magic of the
artist, but the personality, both physical and mental, is lost in the
effort.
But then in this last case Titian was working from an early portrait,
and
without the living original to refer to.</p>
<p>But, before approaching the discussion of the <i>Venus of Urbino</i>,
it is
necessary to say a word about another <i>Venus</i> which must have
been
<a name="Page_29"></a>painted some years before this time, revealing,
as it does, a completely
different and, it must be owned, a higher ideal. This is the terribly
ruined, yet still beautiful, <i>Venus Anadyomene</i>, or <i>Venus of
the Shell</i>, of the
Bridgewater Gallery, painted perhaps at the instigation of some
humanist,
to realise a description of the world-famous painting of Apelles. It is
not at present possible to place this picture with anything approaching
to
chronological exactitude. It must have been painted some years after
the <i>Bacchus and Ariadne</i> of the National Gallery, some years
before the
<i>Venus</i> of the Tribuna, and that is about as near as surmise can
get. The
type of the goddess in the Ellesmere picture recalls somewhat the
<i>Ariadne</i> in our masterpiece at the National Gallery, but also,
albeit in a
less material form, the <i>Magdalens</i> of a later time. Titian's
conception
of perfect womanhood is here midway between his earlier Giorgionesque
ideal and the frankly sensuous yet grand luxuriance of his maturity and
old age. He never, even in the days of youth and Giorgionesque
enchantment, penetrated so far below the surface as did his master and
friend Barbarelli. He could not equal him in giving, with the
undisguised
physical allurement which belongs to the true woman, as distinguished
from
the ideal conception compounded of womanhood's finest attributes, that
sovereignty of amorous yet of spiritual charm which is its complement
and its corrective.<a name="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
Still with Titian, too, in the earlier years, woman, as
presented in the perfection of mature youth, had, accompanying and
elevating her bodily loveliness, a measure of that higher and nobler
feminine attractiveness which would enable her to meet man on equal
terms, nay, actively to exercise a dominating influence of fascination.
In
illustration of this assertion it is only necessary to refer to the
draped
and the undraped figure in the <i>Medea and Venus (Sacred and Profane
Love)</i> of the Borghese Gallery, to the <i>Herodias</i> of the Doria
Gallery, to
the <i>Flora</i> of the Uffizi. Here, even when the beautiful Venetian
courtesan
is represented or suggested, what the master gives is less the mere
votary
than the priestess of love. Of this power of domination, this feminine
royalty, the <i>Venus Anadyomene</i> still retains a measure, but the <i>Venus
of
Urbino</i> and the splendid succession of Venuses and Dana&euml;s,
goddesses,
nymphs, and heroines belonging to the period of the fullest maturity,
<a name="Page_30"></a>show woman in the phase in which, renouncing her
power to enslave,
she is herself reduced to slavery.</p>
<p>These glowing presentments of physical attractiveness embody a lower
ideal&#8212;that of woman as the plaything of man, his precious possession,
his delight in the lower sense. And yet Titian expresses this by no
means exalted conception with a grand candour, an absence of <i>arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e</i>
such as almost purges it of offence. It is Giovanni Morelli who,
in tracing the gradual descent from his recovered treasure, the <i>Venus</i>
of
Giorgione in the Dresden Gallery,<a name="FNanchor_17"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> through the various Venuses of
Titian down to those of the latest manner, so finely expresses the
essential
difference between Giorgione's divinity and her sister in the Tribuna.
The former sleeping, and protected only by her sovereign loveliness, is
safer from offence than the waking goddess&#8212;or shall we not rather say
woman?&#8212;who in Titian's canvas passively waits in her rich Venetian
bower, tended by her handmaidens. It is again Morelli<a
 name="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> who
points out
that, as compared with Correggio, even Giorgione&#8212;to say nothing of
Titian&#8212;is when he renders the beauty of woman or goddess a realist.
And this is true in a sense, yet not altogether. Correggio's <i>Dana&euml;</i>,
his
<i>Io</i>, his <i>Leda</i>, his <i>Venus</i>, are in their exquisite
grace of form and movement
farther removed from the mere fleshly beauty of the undraped model than
are the goddesses and women of Giorgione. The passion and throb
of humanity are replaced by a subtler and less easily explicable charm;
beauty becomes a perfectly balanced and finely modulated harmony. Still
the allurement is there, and it is more consciously and more
provocatively
exercised than with Giorgione, though the fascination of Correggio's
divinities asserts itself less directly, less candidly. Showing through
the frankly human loveliness of Giorgione's women there is after all a
higher spirituality, a deeper intimation of that true, that
clear-burning
passion, enveloping body and soul, which transcends all exterior grace
and harmony, however exquisite it may be in refinement of
voluptuousness.<a name="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="Page_31"></a>It is not, indeed, by any means certain that
we are justified in seriously
criticising as a <i>Venus</i> the great picture of the Tribuna. Titian
himself
has given no indication that the beautiful Venetian woman who lies
undraped after the bath, while in a sumptuous chamber, furnished
according
to the mode of the time, her handmaidens are seeking for the robes
with which she will adorn herself, is intended to present the
love-goddess,
or even a beauty masquerading with her attributes. Vasari, who saw it
in the picture-closet of the Duke of Urbino, describes it, no doubt, as
"une Venere giovanetta a giacere, con fieri e certi panni sottili
attorno."
It is manifestly borrowed, too&#8212;as is now universally acknowledged&#8212;from
Giorgione's <i>Venus</i> in the Dresden Gallery, with the significant
alteration,
however, that Titian's fair one voluptuously dreams awake, while
Giorgione's
goddess more divinely reposes, and sleeping dreams loftier dreams.
The motive is in the borrowing robbed of much of its dignity and
beauty,
and individualised in a fashion which, were any other master than
Titian
in question, would have brought it to the verge of triviality. Still as
an example of his unrivalled mastery in rendering the glow and
semi-transparency
of flesh, enhanced by the contrast with white linen&#8212;itself slightly
golden in tinge; in suggesting the appropriate atmospheric environment;
in giving the full splendour of Venetian colour, duly subordinated
nevertheless
to the main motive, which is the glorification of a beautiful human
body as it is; in all these respects the picture is of superlative
excellence,
a representative example of the master and of Venetian art, a piece
which
it would not be easy to match even among his own works.</p>
<p><a name="Page_32"></a>More and more, as the supreme artist matures,
do we find him
disdaining the showier and more evident forms of virtuosity. His
colour is more and more marked in its luminous beauty by reticence
and concentration, by the search after such a main colour-chord as
shall not only be beautiful and satisfying in itself, but expressive of
the
motive which is at the root of the picture. Play of light over the
surfaces and round the contours of the human form; the breaking-up
and modulation of masses of colour by that play of light; strength, and
beauty of general tone&#8212;these are now Titian's main preoccupations. To
this point his perfected technical art has legitimately developed
itself
from the Giorgionesque ideal of colour and tone-harmony, which was
essentially the same in principle, though necessarily in a less
advanced
stage, and more diversified by exceptions. Our master became, as
time went on, less and less interested in the mere dexterous
juxtaposition
of brilliantly harmonising and brilliantly contrasting tints, in
piquancy, gaiety, and sparkle of colour, to be achieved for its own
sake.
Indeed this phase of Venetian sixteenth-century colour belongs rather
to
those artists who issued from Verona&#8212;to the Bonifazi, and to Paolo
Veronese&#8212;who in this respect, as generally in artistic temperament,
proved
themselves the natural successors of Domenico and Francesco Morone, of
Girolamo dai Libri, of Cavazzola.</p>
<p>Yet when Titian takes colour itself as his chief motive, he can
vie with the most sumptuous of them in splendour, and eclipse them
all by the sureness of his taste. A good example of this is the
celebrated
<i>Bella di Tiziano</i> of the Pitti Gallery, another work which, like
the <i>Venus of Urbino</i>, recalls the features without giving the
precise
personality of Eleonora Gonzaga. The beautiful but somewhat
expressionless
head with its crowning glory of bright hair, a waving mass of
Venetian gold, has been so much injured by rubbing down and restoration
that we regret what has been lost even more than we enjoy what is left.
But the surfaces of the fair and exquisitely modelled neck and bosom
have
been less cruelly treated; the superb costume retains much of its
pristine
splendour. With its combination of brownish-purple velvet, peacock-blue
brocade, and white lawn, its delicate trimmings of gold, and its
further adornment with small knots, having in them, now at any rate,
but
an effaced note of red, the gown of <i>La Bella</i> has remained the
type of
<a name="Page_33"></a>what is most beautiful in Venetian costume as it
was in the earlier half of
the sixteenth century. In richness and ingenious elaboration, chastened
by taste, it far transcends the over-splendid and ponderous dresses in
which later on the patrician dames portrayed by Veronese and his school
loved to array themselves. A bright note of red in the upper jewel of
one earring, now, no doubt, cruder than was originally intended, gives
a
fillip to the whole, after a fashion peculiar to Titian.</p>

<p>The <i>Girl in the Fur Cloak</i>, No 197 in the Imperial Gallery at
Vienna, shows once more in a youthful and blooming woman the features
of Eleonora. The model is nude under a mantle of black satin lined with
fur, which leaves uncovered the right breast and both arms. The picture
is undoubtedly Titian's own, and fine in quality, but it reveals less
than
his usual graciousness and charm. It is probably identical with the
canvas described in the often-quoted catalogue of Charles I.'s pictures
as
"A naked woman putting on her smock, which the king changed with
the Duchess of Buckingham for one of His Majesty's Mantua pieces." It
may well have suggested to Rubens, who must have seen it among the
King's possessions on the occasion of his visit to London, his superb,
yet
singularly unrefined, <i>H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Fourment in a Fur Mantle</i>,
now also in the
Vienna Gallery.</p>
<p>The great portraits of the Duke and Duchess of Urbino in the
Uffizi belong, as has already been noted, to 1537. Francesco Maria,
here represented in the penultimate year of his stormy life, assumes
deliberately the truculent warrior, and has beyond reasonable doubt
made
his own pose in a portrait destined to show the leader of armies, and
not the amorous spouse or the patron of art and artists. Praise
enthusiastic, but not excessive, has ever been and ever will be
lavished
on the breadth and splendid decision of the painting; on the
magnificent rendering of the suit of plain but finely fashioned steel
armour, with its wonderful reflections; on the energy of the virile
countenance, and the appropriate concentration and simplicity of the
whole. The superb head has, it must be confessed, more grandeur
and energy than true individuality or life. The companion picture
represents Eleonora Gonzaga seated near an open window, wearing a
sombre but magnificent costume, and, completing it, one of those
turbans
with which the patrician ladies of North Italy, other than those of
<a name="Page_34"></a>Venice, habitually crowned their locks. It has
suffered in loss of freshness
and touch more than its companion. Fine and accurate as the
portrait is, much as it surpasses its pendant in subtle truth of
characterisation,
it has in the opinion of the writer been somewhat overpraised.
For once, Titian approaches very nearly to the northern ideal in
portraiture,
underlining the truth with singular accuracy, yet with some sacrifice
of graciousness and charm. The daughter of the learned and brilliant
Isabella looks here as if, in the decline of her beauty, she had become
something of a <i>pr&eacute;cieuse</i> and a prude, though it would be
imprudent to
assert that she was either the one or the other. Perhaps the most
attractive feature of the whole composition is the beautiful landscape
so characteristically stretching away into the far blue distance,
suggested
rather than revealed through the open window. This is such a picture
as might have inspired the Netherlander Antonio Moro, just because it
is Italian art of the Cinquecento with a difference, that is, with a
certain
admixture of northern downrightness and literalness of statement.</p>
<p>About this same time Titian received from the brother of this
princess, his patron and admirer Federigo Gonzaga, the commission for
the famous series of the <i>Twelve C&aelig;sars</i>, now only known to
the world
by stray copies here and there, and by the grotesquely exaggerated
engravings of &AElig;gidius Sadeler. Giulio Romano having in 1536<a
 name="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
completed the Sala di Troja in the Castello of Mantua, and made
considerable
progress with the apartments round about it, Federigo Gonzaga
conceived the idea of devoting one whole room to the painted effigies
of
the <i>Twelve C&aelig;sars</i> to be undertaken by Titian. The exact
date
when the <i>C&aelig;sars</i> were delivered is not known, but it may
legitimately
be inferred that this was in the course of 1537 or the earlier half of
1538. Our master's pictures were, according to Vasari, placed in an <i>anticamera</i>
of the Mantuan Palace, below them being hung twelve <i>storie a olio</i>&#8212;histories
in oils&#8212;by Giulio Romano.<a name="FNanchor_21"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> The <i>C&aelig;sars</i> were
all half-<a name="Page_35"></a>lengths,
eleven out of the twelve being done by the Venetian master and
the twelfth by Giulio Romano himself.<a name="FNanchor_22"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> Brought to England with
<a name="Page_36"></a>the rest of the Mantua pieces purchased by Daniel
Nys for Charles I.,
they suffered injury, and Van Dyck is said to have repainted the <i>Vitellius</i>,
which was one of several canvases irretrievably ruined by the
quicksilver
of the frames during the transit from Italy.<a name="FNanchor_23"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> On the disposal of the
royal collection after Charles Stuart's execution the <i>Twelve
C&aelig;sars</i> were
sold by the State&#8212;not presented, as is usually asserted&#8212;to the Spanish
Ambassador Cardenas, who gave &pound;1200 for them. On their arrival in
Spain with the other treasures secured on behalf of Philip IV., they
were
placed in the Alcazar of Madrid, where in one of the numerous fires
which successively devastated the royal palace they must have perished,
since no trace of them is to be found after the end of the seventeenth
century. The popularity of Titian's decorative canvases is proved by
the fact that Bernardino Campi of Cremona made five successive sets of
copies from them&#8212;for Charles V., d'Avalos, the Duke of Alva,
Rangone, and another Spanish grandee. Agostino Caracci subsequently
copied them for the palace of Parma, and traces of yet other copies
exist.
Numerous versions are shown in private collections, both in England and
abroad, purporting to be from the hand of Titian, but of these none&#8212;at
any rate none of those seen by the writer&#8212;are originals or even
Venetian copies. Among the best are the examples in the collection
of Earl Brownlow and at the royal palace of Munich respectively, and
these may possibly be from the hand of Campi. Although we are
expressly told in Dolce's <i>Dialogo</i> that Titian "painted the <i>Twelve
C&aelig;sars</i>, taking them in part from medals, in part from antique
marbles,"
it is perfectly clear that of the exact copying of antiques&#8212;such as is
to
be noted, for instance, in those marble medallions by Donatello which
adorn the courtyard of the Medici Palace at Florence&#8212;there can have
been no question. The attitudes of the <i>C&aelig;sars</i>, as shown
in the
engravings and the extant copies, exclude any such supposition. Those
who have judged them from those copies and the hideous grotesques of
Sadeler have wondered at the popularity of the originals, somewhat
hastily deeming Titian to have been here inferior to himself. Strange
to
say, a better idea of what he intended, and what he may have realised
in
the originals, is to be obtained from a series of small copies now in
the Provincial Museum of Hanover, than from anything else that has
<a name="Page_37"></a>survived.<a name="FNanchor_24"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> The little pictures in
question, being on copper, cannot well
be anterior to the first part of the seventeenth century, and they are
not
in themselves wonders. All the same they have a unique interest as
proving that, while adopting the pompous attitudes and the purely
decorative standpoint which the position of the pictures in the
Castello
may have rendered obligatory, Titian managed to make of his
Emperors creatures of flesh and blood; the splendid Venetian warrior
and patrician appearing in all the glory of manhood behind the
conventional
dignity, the self-consciousness of the Roman type and attitude.</p>

 src="images/image11.jpg"></p>
<p>These last years had been to Titian as fruitful in material gain as
in
honour. He had, as has been seen, established permanent and intimate
relations not only with the art-loving rulers of the North Italian
principalities, but now with Charles V. himself, mightiest of European
sovereigns, and, as a natural consequence, with the all-powerful
captains
and grandees of the Hispano-Austrian court. Meanwhile a serious danger
to his supremacy had arisen. At home in Venice his unique position was
threatened by Pordenone, that masterly and wonderfully facile <i>frescante</i>
and painter of monumental decorations, who had on more than one
occasion in the past been found in competition with him.</p>
<p>The Friulan, after many wanderings and much labour in North Italy,
had settled in Venice in 1535, and there acquired an immense reputation
by the grandeur and consummate ease with which he had carried out great
mural decorations, such as the fa&ccedil;ade of Martin d'Anna's house
on the
Grand Canal, comprising in its scheme of decoration a Curtius on
horse-back
and a flying Mercury which according to Vasari became the talk of
the town.<a name="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
Here, at any rate, was a field in which even Titian himself,
seeing that he had only at long intervals practised in fresco painting,
could
not hope to rival Pordenone. The Friulan, indeed, in this his special
branch, stood entirely alone among the painters of North Italy.</p>
<p><a name="Page_38"></a>The Council of Ten in June 1537 issued a
decree recording that
Titian had since 1516 been in possession of his <i>senseria</i>, or
broker's patent,
and its accompanying salary, on condition that he should paint "the
canvas of the land fight on the side of the Hall of the Great Council
looking out on the Grand Canal," but that he had drawn his salary
without
performing his promise. He was therefore called upon to refund all that
he had received for the time during which he had done no work. This
sharp reminder operated as it was intended to do. We see from Aretino's
correspondence that in November 1537 Titian was busily engaged on the
great canvas for the Doges' Palace. This tardy recognition of an old
obligation did not prevent the Council from issuing an order in
November
1538 directing Pordenone to paint a picture for the Sala del Gran
Consiglio, to occupy the space next to that reserved for Titian's
long-delayed
battle-piece.</p>
<p>That this can never have been executed is clear, since Pordenone, on
receipt of an urgent summons from Ercole II., Duke of Ferrara, departed
from Venice in the month of December of the same year, and falling sick
at Ferrara, died so suddenly as to give rise to the suspicion of foul
play,
which too easily sprang up in those days when ambition or private
vengeance
found ready to hand weapons so many and so convenient. Crowe and
Cavalcaselle give good grounds for the assumption that, in order to
save
appearances, Titian was supposed&#8212;replacing and covering the
battle-piece
which already existed in the Great Hall&#8212;to be presenting the Battle of
Spoleto in Umbria, whereas it was clear to all Venetians, from the
costumes, the banners, and the landscape, that he meant to depict the
Battle of Cadore fought in 1508. The latter was a Venetian victory and
an Imperial defeat, the former a Papal defeat and an Imperial victory.
The all-devouring fire of 1577 annihilated the <i>Battle of Cadore</i>
with too
many other works of capital importance in the history both of the
primitive and the mature Venetian schools. We have nothing now to
show what it may have been, save the print of Fontana, and the oil
painting in the Venetian Gallery of the Uffizi, reproducing on a
reduced
scale part only of the big canvas. This last is of Venetian origin, and
more or less contemporary, but it need hardly be pointed out that it is
a
copy from, not a sketch for, the picture.</p>

 src="images/image12.jpg"></p>
<p>To us who know the vast battle-piece only in the feeble echo of the
<a name="Page_39"></a>print and the picture just now mentioned, it is a
little difficult to account
for the enthusiasm that it excited, and the prominent place accorded to
it
among the most famous of the Cadorine's works. Though the whole has
abundant movement and passion, and the <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> is
undoubtedly
imposing, the combat is not raised above reality into the region of the
higher and more representative truth by any element of tragic vastness
and significance. Even though the Imperialists are armed more or
less in the antique Roman fashion, to distinguish them from the
Venetians, who appear in the accoutrements of their own day, it is
still
that minor and local combat the <i>Battle of Cadore</i> that we have
before
us, and not, above and beyond this battle, War, as some masters of the
<a name="Page_40"></a>century, gifted with a higher power of evocation,
might have shown it.
Even as the fragment of Leonardo da Vinci's <i>Battle of Anghiari</i>
survives
in the free translation of Rubens's well-known drawing in the Louvre,
we see how he has made out of the unimportant cavalry combat, yet
without
conventionality or undue transposition, a representation unequalled in
art of the frenzy generated in man and beast by the clash of arms and
the scent of blood. And Rubens, too, how incomparably in the <i>Battle
of the Amazons</i> of the Pinakothek at Munich, he evokes the terrors,
not
only of one mortal encounter, but of War&#8212;the hideous din, the horror
of man let loose and become beast once more, the pitiless yell of the
victors, the despairing cry of the vanquished, the irremediable
overthrow!
It would, however, be foolhardy in those who can only guess at what the
picture may have been to arrogate to themselves the right of sitting in
judgment on Vasari and those contemporaries who, actually seeing,
enthusiastically admired it. What excited their delight must surely
have
been Titian's magic power of brush as displayed in individual figures
and
episodes, such as that famous one of the knight armed by his page in
the
immediate foreground.</p>
<p>Into this period of our master's career there fit very well the two
portraits in which he appears, painted by himself, on the confines of
old
age, vigorous and ardent still, fully conscious, moreover, though
without
affectation, of pre-eminent genius and supreme artistic rank. The
portraits referred to are those very similar ones, both of them
undoubtedly
originals, which are respectively in the Berlin Gallery and the
Painters'
Gallery of the Uffizi. It is strange that there should exist no certain
likeness of the master of Cadore done in youth or earlier manhood, if
there be excepted the injured and more than doubtful production in the
Imperial Gallery of Vienna, which has pretty generally been supposed to
be an original auto-portrait belonging to this period. In the Uffizi
and
Berlin pictures Titian looks about sixty years old, but may be a little
more or a little less. The latter is a half-length, showing him seated
and
gazing obliquely out of the picture with a majestic air, but also with
something of combativeness and disquietude, an element, this last,
which
is traceable even in some of the earlier portraits, but not in the
mythological
<i>poesie</i> or any sacred work. More and more as we advance through
the final period of old age do we find this element of disquietude and
<a name="Page_41"></a>misgiving asserting itself in male portraiture,
as, for instance, in the
<i>Maltese Knight</i> of the Prado, the <i>Dominican Monk</i> of the
Borghese, the
<i>Portrait of a Man with a Palm Branch</i> of the Dresden Gallery. The
atmosphere of sadness and foreboding enveloping man is traceable back
to
Giorgione; but with him it comes from the plenitude of inner life, from
the gaze turned inwards upon the mystery of the human individuality
rather than outwards upon the inevitable tragedies of the exterior life
common to all. This same atmosphere of passionate contemplativeness
enwraps, indeed, all that Giorgione did, and is the cause that he sees
the
world and himself lyrically, not dramatically; the flame of aspiration
burning steadily at the heart's core and leaving the surface not indeed
unruffled, but outwardly calm in its glow. Titian's is the more
dramatic
temperament in outward things, but also the more superficial. It must
be remembered, too, that arriving rapidly at the maturity of his art,
and
painting all through the period of the full Renaissance, he was able
with
far less hindrance from technical limitations to express his
conceptions to
the full. His portraiture, however, especially his male portraiture,
was
and remained in its essence a splendid and full-blown development of
the
Giorgionesque ideal. It was grander, more accomplished, and for obvious
reasons more satisfying, yet far less penetrating, less expressive of
the
inner fibre, whether of the painter or of his subject.</p>
<p>But to return to the portrait of Berlin. It is in parts unfinished,
and
therefore the more interesting as revealing something of the methods
employed by the master in this period of absolute mastery, when his
palette was as sober in its strength as it was rich and harmonious;
when,
as ever, execution was a way to an end, and therefore not to be
vain-gloriously displayed merely for its own sake. The picture came,
with
very many other masterpieces of the Italian and Netherlandish schools,
from the Solly collection, which formed the nucleus of the Berlin
Gallery.
The Uffizi portrait emerges noble still, in its semi-ruined state, from
a
haze of restoration and injury, which has not succeeded in destroying
the
exceptional fineness and sensitiveness of the modelling. Although the
pose and treatment of the head are practically identical with that in
the
Berlin picture, the conception seems a less dramatic one. It includes,
unless the writer has misread it, an element of greater mansuetude and
a less perturbed reflectiveness.</p>
<p><a name="Page_42"></a>The double portrait in the collection of Her
Majesty the Queen at
Windsor Castle, styled <i>Titian and Franceschini</i><a
 name="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> has
no pretensions
whatever to be even discussed as a Titian. The figure of the Venetian
senator designated as Franceschini is the better performance of the
two;
the lifeless head of Titian, which looks very like an afterthought, has
been copied, without reference to the relation of the two figures the
one
to the other, from the Uffizi picture, or some portrait identical with
it in
character. A far finer likeness of Titian than any of these is the much
later one, now in the Prado Gallery; but this it will be best to deal
with in its proper chronological order.</p>
<p>We come now to one of the most popular of all Titian's great
canvases based on a sacred subject, the <i>Presentation in the Temple</i>
in the
Accademia delle Belle Arti at Venice. This, as Vasari expressly states,
was painted for the Scuola di S. Maria della Carit&agrave;, that is,
for the
confraternity which owned the very building where now the Accademia
displays its treasures. It is the magnificent scenic rendering of a
subject
lending itself easily to exterior pomp and display, not so easily to a
more
mystic and less obvious mode of conception. At the root of Titian's
design lies in all probability the very similar picture on a
comparatively
small scale by Cima da Conegliano, now No. 63 in the Dresden
Gallery, and this last may well have been inspired by Carpaccio's <i>Presentation
of the Virgin</i>, now in the Brera at Milan.<a name="FNanchor_27"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> The imposing canvases
belonging to this particular period of Titian's activity, and this one
in
particular, with its splendid architectural framing, its wealth of life
and
movement, its richness and variety in type and costume, its fair
prospect
of Venetian landscape in the distance, must have largely contributed to
form the transcendent decorative talent of Paolo Veronese. Only in the
exquisitely fresh and beautiful figure of the childlike Virgin, who
ascends
the mighty flight of stone steps, clad all in shimmering blue, her head
crowned with a halo of yellow light, does the artist prove that he has
penetrated to the innermost significance of his subject. Here, at any
<a name="Page_43"></a><a name="Page_44"></a>rate, he touches the heart
as well as feasts the eye. The thoughts of all
who are familiar with Venetian art will involuntarily turn to
Tintoretto's
rendering of the same moving, yet in its symbolical character not
naturally
ultra-dramatic, scene. The younger master lends to it a significance so
vast that he may be said to go as far beyond and above the requirements
of the theme as Titian, with all his legitimate splendour and serene
dignity,
remains below it. With Tintoretto as interpreter we are made to see the
beautiful episode as an event of the most tremendous import&#8212;one that
must shake the earth to its centre. The reason of the onlooker may
rebel against this portentous version, yet he is dominated all the
same, is
overwhelmed with something of the indefinable awe that has seized upon
the bystanders who are witnesses of the scene.</p>

<p>But now to discuss a very curious point in connection with the
actual
state of Titian's important canvas. It has been very generally
assumed&#8212;and
Crowe and Cavalcaselle have set their seal on the assumption&#8212;that
Titian painted his picture for a special place in the Albergo (now
Accademia), and that this place is now architecturally as it was in
Titian's time. Let them speak for themselves. "In this room (in the
Albergo), which is contiguous to the modern hall in which Titian's
<i>Assunta</i> is displayed, there were two doors for which allowance
was
made in Titian's canvas; twenty-five feet&#8212;the length of the wall&#8212;is
now the length of the picture. When this vast canvas was removed
from its place, the gaps of the doors were filled in with new linen,
and
painted up to the tone of the original...."</p>
<p>That the pieces of canvas to which reference is here made were
new, and not Titian's original work from the brush, was of course well
known to those who saw the work as it used to hang in the Accademia.
Crowe and Cavalcaselle give indeed the name of a painter of this
century
who is responsible for them. Within the last three years the new and
enterprising director of the Venice Academy, as part of a comprehensive
scheme of rearrangement of the whole collection, caused these pieces of
new canvas to be removed and then proceeded to replace the picture in
the room for which it is believed to have been executed, fitting it
into
the space above the two doors just referred to. Many people have
declared themselves delighted with the alteration, looking upon it as a
tardy act of justice done to Titian, whose work, it is assumed, is now
<a name="Page_45"></a>again seen just as he designed it for the
Albergo. The writer must own
that he has, from an examination of the canvas where it is now placed,
or
replaced, derived an absolutely contrary impression. First, is it
conceivable
that Titian in the heyday of his glory should have been asked to
paint such a picture&#8212;not a mere mural decoration&#8212;for such a place?
There is no instance of anything of the kind having been done with the
canvases painted by Gentile Bellini, Carpaccio, Mansueti, and others
for
the various <i>Scuole</i> of Venice. There is no instance of a great
decorative
canvas by a sixteenth century master of the first rank,<a
 name="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
other than a ceiling
decoration, being degraded in the first instance to such a use. And
then Vasari, who saw the picture in Venice, and correctly characterises
it,
would surely have noticed such an extraordinary peculiarity as the
abnormal shape necessitated by the two doors. It is incredible that
Titian, if so unpalatable a task had indeed been originally imposed
upon
him, should not have designed his canvas otherwise. The hole for the
right door coming in the midst of the monumental steps is just
possible,
though not very probable. Not so that for the left door, which,
according
to the present arrangement, cuts the very vitals out of one of the
main groups in the foreground. Is it not to insult one of the greatest
masters of all time thus to assume that he would have designed what we
now see? It is much more likely that Titian executed his <i>Presentation</i>
in the first place in the normal shape, and that vandals of a later
time,
deciding to pierce the room in the Scuola in which the picture is now
once more placed with one, or probably two, additional doors, partially
sacrificed it to the structural requirements of the moment. Monstrous
as such barbarism may appear, we have already seen, and shall again see
<a name="Page_46"></a>later on, that it was by no means uncommon in
those great ages of
painting, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>
<p>When the untimely death of Pordenone, at the close of 1538, had
extinguished the hopes of the Council that the grandiose facility of
this
master of monumental decoration might be made available for the
purposes of the State, Titian having, as has been seen, made good his
gravest default, was reinstated in his lucrative and by no means
onerous
office. He regained the <i>senseria</i> by decree of August 28, 1539.
The
potent d'Avalos, Marqu&eacute;s del Vasto, had in 1539 conferred upon
Titian's
eldest son Pomponio, the scapegrace and spendthrift that was to be,
a canonry. Both to father and son the gift was in the future to be
productive of more evil than good. At or about the same time he had
commissioned of Titian a picture of himself haranguing his soldiers in
the pompous Roman fashion; this was not, however, completed until
1541. Exhibited by d'Avalos to admiring crowds at Milan, it made a
sensation for which there is absolutely nothing in the picture, as we
now
see it in the gallery of the Prado, to account; but then it would
appear
that it was irreparably injured in a fire which devastated the Alcazar
of
Madrid in 1621, and was afterwards extensively repainted. The Marquis
and his son Francesco, both of them full-length figures, are placed on
a
low plinth, to the left, and from this point of vantage the Spanish
leader
addresses a company of foot-soldiers who with fine effect raise their
halberds high into the air.<a name="FNanchor_29"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Among these last tradition
places a portrait
of Aretino, which is not now to be recognised with any certainty. Were
the pedigree of the canvas a less well-authenticated one, one might be
tempted to deny Titian's authorship altogether, so extraordinary are,
apart from other considerations, the disproportions in the figure of
the
youth Francesco. Restoration must in this instance have amounted to
entire repainting. Del Vasto appears more robust, more martial, and
slightly younger than the armed leader in the <i>Allegory</i> of the
Louvre.
If this last picture is to be accepted as a semi-idealised presentment
of the
Spanish captain, it must, as has already been pointed out, have been
painted nearer to the time of his death, which took place in 1546. The
<a name="Page_47"></a>often-cited biographers of our master are clearly
in error in their conclusion
that the painting described in the collection of Charles I. as "done by
Titian, the picture of the Marquis Guasto, containing five half-figures
so
big as the life, which the king bought out of an Almonedo," is
identical
with the large sketch made by Titian as a preparation for the <i>Allocution</i>
<a name="Page_48"></a>of Madrid. This description, on the contrary,
applies perfectly to the
<i>Allegory</i> of the Louvre, which was, as we know, included in the
collection
of Charles, and subsequently found its way into that of Louis Quatorze.</p>

<p>It was in 1542 that Vasari, summoned to Venice at the suggestion of
Aretino, paid his first visit to the city of the Lagoons in order to
paint
the scenery and <i>apparato</i> in connection with a carnival
performance, which
included the representation of his fellow-townsman's <i>Talanta.<a
 name="FNanchor_30"></a></i><a href="#Footnote_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
It was
on this occasion, no doubt, that Sansovino, in agreement with Titian,
obtained for the Florentine the commission to paint the ceilings of
Santo
Spirito in Isola&#8212;a commission which was afterwards, as a consequence of
his departure, undertaken and performed by Titian himself, with whose
grandiose canvases we shall have to deal a little later on. In weighing
the value of Vasari's testimony with reference to the works of Vecellio
and other Venetian painters more or less of his own time, it should be
borne
in mind that he paid two successive visits to Venice, enjoying there
the
company of the great painter and the most eminent artists of the day,
and
that on the occasion of Titian's memorable visit to Rome he was his
close
friend, cicerone, and companion. Allowing for the Aretine biographer's
well-known inaccuracies in matters of detail and for his royal
disregard of
chronological order&#8212;faults for which it is manifestly absurd to blame
him
over-severely&#8212;it would be unwise lightly to disregard or overrule his
testimony with regard to matters which he may have learned from the
lips of Titian himself and his immediate <i>entourage</i>.</p>
<p>To the year 1542 belongs, as the authentic signature and date on the
picture affirm, that celebrated portrait, <i>The Daughter of Roberto
Strozzi</i>,
once in the splendid palace of the family at Florence, but now, with
some
other priceless treasures having the same origin, in the Berlin Museum.
Technically, the picture is one of the most brilliant, one of the most
subtly exquisite, among the works of the great Cadorine's maturity. It
well serves to show what Titian's ideal of colour was at this time. The
canvas is all silvery gleam, all splendour and sober strength of
colour&#8212;yet
not of colours. These in all their plentitude and richness, as in the
crimson drapery and the distant landscape, are duly subordinated to the
main effect; they but set off discreetly the figure of the child,
dressed all
in white satin with hair of reddish gold, and contribute without
fanfare to
<a name="Page_49"></a>the fine and harmonious balance of the whole.
Here, as elsewhere, more
particularly in the work of Titian's maturity, one does not in the
first
place pause to pick out this or the other tint, this or the other
combination
of colours as particularly exquisite; and that is what one is
<a name="Page_50"></a>so easily led to do in the contemplation of the
Bonifazi and of Paolo
Veronese.</p>

<p>As the portrait of a child, though in conception it reveals a marked
progress towards the <i>intimit&eacute;</i> of later times, the Berlin
picture lacks
something of charm and that quality which, for want of a better
word, must be called loveableness. Or is it perhaps that the eighteenth
and
nineteenth centuries have spoilt us in this respect? For it is only in
these latter days that to the child, in deliberate and avowed
portraiture,
is allowed that freakishness, that natural <i>espi&egrave;glerie</i>
and freedom from
artificial control which has its climax in the unapproached portraits
of Sir Joshua Reynolds. This is the more curious when it is remembered
how tenderly, with what observant and sympathetic truth the relation of
child to mother, of child to child, was noted in the innumerable
"Madonnas" and "Holy Families" of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries; how both the Italians, and following them the Netherlanders,
relieved the severity of their sacred works by the delightful
roguishness,
the romping impudence of their little angels, their <i>putti</i>.</p>
<p>It has already been recorded that Titian, taking up the commission
abandoned by Vasari, undertook a great scheme of pictorial decoration
for
the Brothers of Santo Spirito in Isola. All that he carried out for
that
church has now found its way into that of the Salute. The three ceiling
pictures, <i>The Sacrifice of Isaac, Cain and Abel</i>, and <i>David
victorious
over Goliath</i>, are in the great sacristy of the church; the <i>Four
Evangelists</i>
and <i>Four Doctors</i> are in the ceiling of the choir behind the
altar; the
altar-piece, <i>The Descent of the Holy Spirit</i>, is in one of the
chapels which
completely girdle the circular church itself. The ceiling pictures,
depicting
three of the most dramatic moments in sacred history, have received
the most enthusiastic praise from the master's successive biographers.
They were indeed at the time of their inception a new thing in Venetian
art. Nothing so daring as these foreshortenings, as these scenes of
dramatic violence, of physical force triumphant, had been seen in
Venice.
The turbulent spirit was an exaggeration of that revealed by Titian in
the <i>St. Peter Martyr</i>; the problem of the foreshortening for the
purposes
of ceiling decoration was superadded. It must be remembered, too, that
even in Rome, the headquarters of the grand style, nothing precisely of
the same kind could be said to exist. Raphael and his pupils either dis<a
 name="Page_51"></a>dained,
or it may be feared to approach, the problem. Neither in the
ceiling decorations of the Farnesina nor in the Stanze is there any
attempt
on a large scale to <i>faire plafonner</i> the figures, that is, to
paint them so that
they might appear as they would actually be seen from below.
Michelangelo
himself, in the stupendous decoration of the ceiling to the Sixtine
Chapel, had elected to treat the subjects of the flat surface which
constitutes
the centre and climax of the whole, as a series of pictures designed
under
ordinary conditions. It can hardly be doubted that Titian, in
attempting
these <i>tours de force</i>, though not necessarily or even probably
in any other
way, was inspired by Correggio. It would not be easy, indeed, to
exaggerate
the Venetian master's achievement from this point of view, even though
in two at least of the groups&#8212;the <i>Cain and Abel</i> and the <i>David
and
Goliath</i>&#8212;the modern professor might be justified in criticising with
considerable severity his draughtsmanship and many salient points in
his
design. The effect produced is tremendous of its kind. The power
suggested is, however, brutal, unreasoning, not nobly dominating force;
and this not alone in the <i>Cain and Abel</i>, where such an
impression is
rightly conveyed, but also in the other pieces. It is as if Titian, in
striving to go beyond anything that had hitherto been done of the same
kind, had also gone beyond his own artistic convictions, and thus,
while
compassing a remarkable pictorial achievement, lost his true balance.
Tintoretto, creating his own atmosphere, as far outside and above mere
physical realities as that of Michelangelo himself, might have
succeeded
in mitigating this impression, which is, on the whole, a painful one.
Take for instance the <i>Martyrdom of St. Christopher</i> of the
younger
painter&#8212;not a ceiling picture by the way&#8212;in the apse of S. Maria del
Orto. Here, too, is depicted, with sweeping and altogether irresistible
power, an act of hideous violence. And yet it is not this element of
the subject which makes upon the spectator the most profound effect,
but the impression of saintly submission, of voluntary self-sacrifice,
which
is the dominant note of the whole.</p>
<p>It may be convenient to mention here <i>The Descent of the Holy
Spirit</i>,
although in its definitive form, as we see it in its place in the
Church of
the Salute, it appears markedly more advanced in style than the works
of
the period at which we have now arrived, giving, both in manner and
feeling, a distinct suggestion of the methods and standpoint which
<a name="Page_52"></a>mark the later phase of old age. Vasari tells us
that the picture,
originally painted in 1541, was seriously damaged and subsequently
repainted; Crowe and Cavalcaselle state that the work now seen at the
Salute was painted to replace an altar-piece which the Brothers of
Santo
Spirito had declined to accept. Even as the picture now appears,
somewhat faded, and moreover seen at a disadvantage amid its cold
surroundings of polished white marble, it is a composition of
wonderful,
of almost febrile animation, and a painting saturated with light,
pierced
through everywhere with its rays. The effect produced is absolutely
that which the mystical subject requires.<a name="FNanchor_31"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Abandoning the passionless
serenity which has been the rule in sacred subjects of the middle time,
Titian shows himself more stimulated, more moved by his subject.</p>
<p>It was in the spring of 1543 that the master first came into
personal
contact with Pope Paul III. and the Farnese family. The meeting took
place at Ferrara, and our painter then accompanied the papal court to
Busseto, and subsequently proceeded to Bologna. Aretino's
correspondence
proves that Titian must at that time have painted the Pope, and
that he must also have refused the sovereign pontiff's offer of the <i>Piombo</i>,
which was then still, as it had been for years past, in the possession
of
Sebastiano Luciani. That Titian, with all his eagerness for wealth and
position, could not find it in his heart to displace his
fellow-countryman, a
friend no doubt of the early time, may legitimately excite admiration
and
sympathy now, as according to Aretino it actually did at the time. The
portraits of the Farnese family included that of the Pope, repeated
subsequently for Cardinal Santafiore, that of Pier Luigi, then that of
Paul III. and this monstrous yet well-loved son together,<a
 name="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> and
a likeness
of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Upon the three-quarter length portrait
of Paul III. in the Naples Museum, Crowe and Cavalcaselle have lavished
their most enthusiastic praise, placing it, indeed, among his
masterpieces.
All the same&#8212;interesting as the picture undoubtedly is, remarkable
in finish, and of undoubtedly Titianesque origin&#8212;the writer finds it
difficult,
<a name="Page_53"></a>nay impossible, to accept this <i>Paul III.</i>
as a work from the hand of Titian
himself. Careful to excess, and for such an original too much wanting
in
brilliancy and vitality, it is the best of many repetitions and
variations;
of this particular type the original is not at present forthcoming.
Very
different is the "Paul III." of the Hermitage, which even in a
reproduction
loudly proclaims its originality.<a name="FNanchor_33"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> This is by no means identical
in
design with the Naples picture, but appears much less studied, much
more directly taken from the life. The astute Farnese Pope has here
the same simiesque type, the same furtive distrustful look, as in the
great unfinished group now to be described.<a name="FNanchor_34"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> This Titian, which doubtless
passed into the Hermitage with the rest of the Barbarigo pictures,
may have been the first foundation for the series of portraits of the
Farnese Pope, and as such would naturally have been retained by the
master for his own use. The portrait-group in the Naples Museum,
showing, with Paul III., Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and Ottavio
Farnese
(afterwards Duke of Parma), is, apart from its extraordinary directness
and swift technical mastery, of exceptional interest as being
unfinished,
and thus doubly instructive. The composition, lacking in its unusual
momentariness the repose and dignity of Raphael's <i>Leo X. with
Cardinals
Giulio de' Medici and de' Rossi</i> at the Pitti, is not wholly happy.
Especially is the action of Ottavio Farnese, as in reverence he bends
down
to reply to the supreme Pontiff, forced and unconvincing; but the
unflattered
portrait of the pontiff himself is of a bold and quite unconventional
truth, and in movement much happier. The picture may possibly, by
reason of this unconventional conception less than perfectly realised,
have
failed to please the sitters, and thus have been left in its present
state.<a name="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>
<p>Few of Titian's canvases of vast dimensions have enjoyed a higher
degree of popularity than the large <i>Ecce Homo</i> to which the
Viennese
proudly point as one of the crowning ornaments of the great Imperial
<a name="Page_54"></a>Gallery of their city. Completed in 1543<a
 name="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> for
Giovanni d'Anna, a son of
the Flemish merchant Martin van der Hanna, who had established himself
in Venice, it was vainly coveted by Henri III. on the occasion of his
memorable
visit in 1574, but was in 1620 purchased for the splendid favourite,
George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, by the English envoy Sir Henry
Wotton. From him the noblest and most accomplished of English
collectors,
Thomas, Earl of Arundel, sought to obtain the prize with the
unparalleled
offer of &pound;7000, yet even thus failed. At the time of the great
<i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>, in 1648, the guardians and advisers of his
youthful son and successor
were glad enough to get the splendid gallery over to the Low Countries,
and
to sell with the rest the <i>Ecce Homo</i>, which brought under these
circumstances
but a tenth part of what Lord Arundel would have given for it. Passing
into the collection of the Archduke Leopold William, it was later on
finally incorporated with that of the Imperial House of Austria. From
the point of view of scenic and decorative magnificence combined with
dramatic propriety, though not with any depth or intensity of dramatic
passion, the work is undoubtedly imposing. Yet it suffers somewhat,
even in this respect, from the fact that the figures are not more than
small life-size. With passages of Titianesque splendour there are to be
noted others, approaching to the acrid and inharmonious, which one
would rather attribute to the master's assistants than to himself. So
it is,
too, with certain exaggerations of design characteristic rather of the
period than the man&#8212;notably with the two figures to the left of the
foreground. The Christ in His meekness is too little divine, too heavy
and inert;<a name="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
the Pontius Pilate not inappropriately reproduces the features
of the worldling and <i>viveur</i> Aretino. The mounted warrior to the
extreme right, who has been supposed to represent Alfonso d'Este, shows
the genial physiognomy made familiar by the Madrid picture so long
deemed to be his portrait, but which, as has already been pointed out,
represents much more probably his successor Ercole II. d'Este, whom
we find again in that superb piece by the master, the so-called <i>Giorgio
Cornaro</i> of Castle Howard. The <i>Ecce Homo</i> of Vienna is
another of
<a name="Page_55"></a><a name="Page_56"></a>the works of which both the
general <i>ordonnance</i> and the truly Venetian
splendour must have profoundly influenced Paolo Veronese.</p>

<p>To this period belongs also the <i>Annunciation of the Virgin</i>
now in the
Cathedral of Verona&#8212;a rich, harmonious, and appropriate altar-piece,
but
not one of any special significance in the life-work of the painter.</p>
<p><a name="Page_57"></a>Shall we not, pretty much in agreement with
Vasari, place here, just
before the long-delayed visit to Rome, the <i>Christ with the Pilgrims
at
Emmaus</i> of the Louvre? A strong reason for dating this, one of the
noblest, one of the most deeply felt of all Titian's works, before
rather
than after the stay in the Eternal City, is that in its <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>,
in its
realistic episodes, in its fulness of life, it is so entirely and
delightfully
Venetian. Here again the colour-harmony in its subdued richness and
solemnity has a completeness such as induces the beholder to accept it
in its unity rather than to analyse those infinite subtleties of
juxtaposition
and handling which, avoiding bravura, disdain to show themselves on
the surface. The sublime beauty of the landscape, in which, as often
elsewhere, the golden radiance of the setting sun is seen battling with
masses of azure cloud, has not been exceeded by Titian himself. With
all the daring yet perfectly unobtrusive and unconscious realism of
certain details, the conception is one of the loftiest, one of the most
penetrating in its very simplicity, of Venetian art at its apogee. The
divine mansuetude, the human and brotherly sympathy of the Christ,
have not been equalled since the early days of the <i>Cristo della
Moneta</i>.
Altogether the <i>Pilgrims at Emmaus</i> well marks that higher and
more
far-reaching conception of sacred art which reveals itself in the
productions
of Titian's old age, when we compare them with the untroubled
serenity and the conventional assumptions of the middle time.<a
 name="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>
<p>To the year 1545 belongs the supremely fine <i>Portrait of Aretino</i>,
which is one of the glories of the Pitti Gallery. This was destined to
propitiate the Grand Duke Cosimo of Tuscany, the son of his
passionately
<a name="Page_58"></a>attached friend of earlier days, Giovanni delle
Bande Nere. Aretino, who
had particular reasons for desiring to appear before the obdurate
Cosimo
in all the pomp and opulence of his later years, was obviously wounded
that Titian, true to his genius, and to his method at this moment,
should
have made the keynote of his masterpiece a dignified simplicity. For
once unfaithful to his brother Triumvir and friend, he attacks him in
the accompanying letter to the Tuscan ruler with the withering sarcasm
that "the satins, velvets, and brocades would perhaps have been better
if
Titian had received a few more scudi for working them out." If
Aretino's pique had not caused the momentary clouding over of his
artistic vision, he would have owned that the canvas now in the
Pitti was one of the happiest achievements of Titian and one of the
greatest things in portraiture. There is no flattery here of the
"Divine Aretino," as with heroic impudence the notorious publicist
styles himself. The sensual type is preserved, but rendered acceptable,
and in a sense attractive, by a certain assurance and even dignity of
bearing, such as success and a position impregnable of its unique and
unenviable kind may well have lent to the adventurer in his maturity.
Even Titian's brush has not worked with greater richness and freedom,
with an effect broader or more entirely legitimate than in the head
with
its softly flowing beard and the magnificent yet not too ornate robe
and
vest of plum-coloured velvet and satin.</p>

<br>
<p>At last, in the autumn of 1545, the master of Cadore, at the age of
sixty-eight
years, was to see Rome, its ruins, its statues, its antiquities, and
what to the painter of the Renaissance must have meant infinitely more,
the Sixtine Chapel and the Stanze of the Vatican. Upon nothing in the
history of Venetian art have its lovers, and the many who, with
profound
interest, trace Titian's noble and perfectly consistent career from its
commencement to its close, more reason to congratulate themselves than
on
this circumstance, that in youth and earlier manhood fortune and his
own
success kept him from visiting Rome. Though his was not the eclectic
tendency, the easily impressionable artistic temperament of a
Sebastiano
Luciani&#8212;the only eclectic, perhaps, who managed all the same to prove
and
to maintain himself an artist of the very first rank&#8212;if Titian had in
earlier
life been lured to the Eternal City, and had there settled, the glamour
of
the grand style might have permanently and fatally disturbed his
balance.
Now it was too late for the splendid and gracious master, who even
at sixty-eight had still before him nearly thirty fruitful years, to
receive
any impressions sufficiently deep to penetrate to the root of his art.
There is some evidence to show that Titian, deeply impressed with the
highest manifestations of the Florentine and Umbro-Florentine art
transplanted to Rome, considered that his work had improved after the
visit
of 1545-1546. If there was such improvement&#8212;and certainly in the
<a name="Page_60"></a>ultimate phases of his practice there will be
evident in some ways a wider
view, a higher grasp of essentials, a more responsive sensitiveness in
the
conceiving anew of the great sacred subjects&#8212;it must have come, not
from
any effort to assimilate the manner or to assume the standpoint which
had
obtained in Rome, but from the closer contact with a world which at its
centre was beginning to take a deeper, a more solemn and gloomy view
of religion and life. It should not be forgotten that this was the
year when the great Council of Trent first met, and that during the
next
twenty years or more the whole of Italy, nay, the whole of the Catholic
world, was overshadowed by its deliberations.</p>
<p>Titian's friend and patron of that time, Guidobaldo II., Duke of
Urbino, had at first opposed Titian's visit to the Roman court,
striving to
reserve to himself the services of the Venetian master until such time
as he should have carried out for him the commissions with which he was
charged. Yielding, however, to the inevitable, and yielding, too, with
a
good grace, he himself escorted his favourite with his son Orazio from
Venice through Ferrara to Pesaro, and having detained him a short while
there, granted him an escort through the Papal States to Rome. There
he was well received by the Farnese Pope, and with much cordiality by
Cardinal Bembo. Rooms were accorded to him in the Belvedere section
of the Vatican Palace, and there no doubt he painted the unfinished
portrait-group <i>Paul III. with Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and
Ottavio
Farnese</i>, which has been already described, and with it other pieces
of the
same type, and portraits of the Farnese family and circle now no longer
to be traced. Vasari, well pleased no doubt to renew his acquaintance
with the acknowledged head of the contemporary Venetian painters, acted
as his cicerone in the visits to the antiquities of Rome, to the
statues and
art-treasures of the Vatican, while Titian's fellow-citizen Sebastiano
del
Piombo was in his company when he studied the Stanze of Raphael.</p>
<p>It was but three years since Michelangelo's <i>Last Judgment</i>
had been
uncovered in the Sixtine, and it would have been in the highest degree
interesting to read his comments on this gigantic performance, towards
which it was so little likely that his sympathies would spontaneously
go
out. Memorable is the visit paid by Buonarroti, with an unwonted regard
for ceremonious courtesy, to Titian in his apartments at the Belvedere,
as
it is recalled by Vasari with that na&iuml;ve touch, that power of
suggestion, which
<a name="Page_61"></a>gives such delightful colour to his unstudied
prose. No <i>Imaginary
Conversation</i> among those that Walter Savage Landor has devised
equals
in significance this meeting of the two greatest masters then living,
simply
as it is sketched in by the Aretine biographer. The noble Venetian
representing the alternating radiance and gloom of earth, its fairest
pages
as they unfold themselves, the joys and sorrows, the teeming life of
humanity; the mighty Florentine disdainful of the world, its colours,
its
<a name="Page_62"></a>pulsations, its pomps and vanities, incurious of
mankind save in its great
symbolical figures, soaring like the solitary eagle into an atmosphere
of
his own where the dejected beholder can scarce breathe, and, sick at
heart,
oppressed with awe, lags far behind!</p>

<p>Titian the gracious, the serene, who throughout a long life of
splendid
and by comparison effortless achievement has openly and candidly drunk
deep of all the joys of life, a man even as others are! Michelangelo
the
austere, the scornful, to whom the pleasures of the world, the company
in
well-earned leisure of his fellow-man, suggest but the loss of precious
hours
which might be devoted to the shaping in solitude of masterpieces; in
the
very depths of whose nature lurk nevertheless, even in old age, the
strangest
ardours, the fiercest and most insatiate longings for love and
friendship!</p>
<p>Let Vasari himself be heard as to this meeting. "Michelangelo and
Vasari going one day to pay a visit to Titian in the Belvedere, saw, in
a
picture which he had then advanced towards completion, a nude female
figure representing <i>Dana&euml;</i> as she receives the embrace of
Jove transformed
into a rain of gold, and, as the fashion is in people's presence,
praised it
much to him. When they had taken leave, and the discussion was as to
the art of Titian, Buonarroti praised it highly, saying that the colour
and
handling pleased him much, but that it was a subject for regret that at
Venice they did not learn from the very beginning to design correctly,
and that its painters did not follow a better method in their study of
art."
It is the battle that will so often be renewed between the artist who
looks
upon colour as merely a complement and adjunct to design, and the
painter who regards it as not only the outer covering, but the body and
soul of art. We remember how the stiff-necked Ingres, the greatest
Raphaelesque of this century, hurled at Delacroix's head the famous
dictum, "Le dessin c'est la probit&eacute; de l'art," and how his
illustrious rival,
the chief of a romanticism which he would hardly acknowledge,
vindicated
by works rather than by words his contention that, if design was
indeed art's conscience, colour was its life-blood, its very being.</p>
<p>The <i>Dana&euml;</i>, seen and admired with reservations by
Buonarroti in the
painting-room of Titian at the Belvedere, is now, with its beauty
diminished in important particulars, to be found with the rest of the
Farnese pictures in the gallery of the Naples Museum. It serves to show
that if the artist was far beyond the stage of imitation or even of
assimila<a name="Page_63"></a><a name="Page_64"></a>tion
on the larger scale, he was, at any rate, affected by the Roman
atmosphere in art. For once he here comes nearer to the realisation of
Tintoretto's ideal&#8212;the colour of Titian and the design of
Michelangelo&#8212;than
his impetuous pupil and rival ever did. While preserving in the
<i>Dana&euml;</i> his own true warmth and transparency of Venetian
colour&#8212;now
somewhat obscured yet not effaced&#8212;he combines unusual weightiness
and majesty with voluptuousness in the nude, and successfully
strives after a more studied rhythm in the harmony of the composition
generally than the art of Venice usually affected.</p>

<p>Titian, in his return from Rome, which he was never to revisit, made
a stay at Florence with an eye, as we may guess, both to business and
pleasure. There, as Vasari takes care to record, our master visited the
artistic sights, and <i>rimase stupefatto</i>&#8212;remained in breathless
astonishment&#8212;as
he had done when he made himself acquainted with the artistic glories
of Rome. This is but vague, and a little too much smacks of
self-flattery
and adulation of the brother Tuscans. Titian was received by Duke
Cosimo at Poggio a Caiano, but his offer to paint the portrait of the
Medici ruler was not well received. It may be, as Vasari surmises, that
this attitude was taken up by the duke in order not to do wrong to the
"many noble craftsmen" then practising in his city and dominion. More
probably, however, Cosimo's hatred and contempt of his father's minion
Aretino, whose portrait by Titian he had condescended to retain, yet
declined to acknowledge, impelled him to show something less than
favour to the man who was known to be the closest friend and intimate
of this self-styled "Scourge of Princes."</p>
<p>Crowe and Cavalcaselle have placed about the year 1555 the
extravagantly
lauded <i>St. John the Baptist in the Desert</i>, once in the
church of S.M. Maria Maggiore at Venice, and now in the Accademia
there. To the writer it appears that it would best come in at this
stage&#8212;that
is to say in or about 1545&#8212;not only because the firm close
handling in the nude would be less explicable ten years later on, but
because the conception of the majestic St. John is for once not
pictorial
but purely sculptural. Leaving Rome, and immediately afterwards
coming into contact for the first time with the wonders of the earlier
Florentine art, Titian might well have conceived, might well have
painted
thus. Strange to say, the influence is not that of Michelangelo, but,
<a name="Page_65"></a>unless the writer is greatly deceived, that of
Donatello, whose noble
ascetic type of the <i>Precursor</i> is here modernised, and in the
process
deprived of some of its austerity. The glorious mountain landscape,
with its brawling stream, fresher and truer than any torrent of
Ruysdael's,
is all Titian. It makes the striking figure of St. John, for all its
majesty,
appear not a little artificial.</p>
<p>The little town of Serravalle, still so captivatingly Venetian in
its
general aspect, holds one of the most magnificent works of Titian's
late
time, a vast <i>Virgin and Child with St. Peter and St. Andrew</i>.
This
hangs&#8212;or did when last seen by the writer&#8212;in the choir of the Church
of St. Andrew; there is evidence in Titian's correspondence that it was
finished in 1547, so that it must have been undertaken soon after the
return from Rome. In the distance between the two majestic figures of
the saints is a prospect of landscape with a lake, upon which Titian
has
shown on a reduced scale Christ calling Peter and Andrew from their
nets; an undisguised adaptation this, by the veteran master, of the
divine
Urbinate's <i>Miraculous Draught of Fishes</i>, but one which made of
the
borrowed motive a new thing, no excrescence but an integral part of the
conception. In this great work, which to be more universally celebrated
requires only to be better known to those who do not come within the
narrow circle of students, there is evidence that while Titian, after
his stay at the Papal court, remained firm as a rock in his style and
general principles&#8212;luckily a Venetian and no pseudo-Roman,&#8212;his
imagination became more intense in its glow, gloomier but grander, than
it had been in middle age&#8212;his horizon altogether vaster. To a grand if
sometimes too unruffled placidity succeeded a physical and psychical
perturbation which belonged both to the man in advanced years and
to the particular moment in the century. Even in his treatment of
classic myth, of the nude in goddess and woman, there was, as we shall
see presently, a greater unrest and a more poignant sensuality&#8212;there
was
evidence of a mind and temperament troubled anew instead of being
tranquillised by the oncoming of old age.</p>
<p>Are we to place here, as Crowe and Cavalcaselle do, the <i>Venus
and
Cupid</i> of the Tribuna and the <i>Venus with the Organ Player</i> of
the
Prado? The technical execution of these canvases, the treatment of
landscape in the former, would lead the writer to place them some years
<a name="Page_66"></a>farther on still in the <i>oeuvre</i> of the
master. There are, however, certain
reasons for following them in this chronological arrangement. The
<i>Venus and Cupid</i> which hangs in the Tribuna of the Uffizi, as the
pendant to the more resplendent but more realistic <i>Venus of Urbino</i>,
is a
darker and less well-preserved picture than its present companion, but
a
grander if a more audacious presentment of the love-goddess. Yet
even here she is not so much the Cytherean as an embodiment of the
Venetian ideal of the later time, an exemplification of the undisguised
worship of fleshly loveliness which then existed in Venice. It has been
pointed out that the later Venus has the features of Titian's fair
daughter
Lavinia, and this is no doubt to a certain extent true. The goddesses,
nymphs, and women of this time bear a sort of general family
resemblance
to her and to each other. This piece illustrates the preferred type of
Titian's old age, as the <i>Vanitas, Herodias</i>, and <i>Flora</i>
illustrate the
preferred type of his youth; as the paintings which we have learnt to
associate with the Duchess of Urbino illustrate that of his middle
time.
The dignity and rhythmic outline of Eros in the <i>Dana&euml;</i> of
Naples have
been given up in favour of a more naturalistic conception of the
insinuating
urchin, who is in this <i>Venus and Cupid</i> the successor of those
much
earlier <i>amorini</i> in the <i>Worship of Venus</i> at Madrid. The
landscape in
its sweeping breadth is very characteristic of the late time, and would
give good reason for placing the picture later than it here appears.
The difficulty is this. The <i>Venus with the Organ Player</i><a
 name="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> of
Madrid, which in many essential points is an inferior repetition of the
later <i>Venus</i> of the Tribuna, contains the portrait of Ottavio
Farnese,
much as we see him in the unfinished group painted, as has been
recorded, at Rome in 1546. This being the case, it is not easy to place
the <i>Venus and Cupid</i>, or its subsequent adaptation, much later
than just
before the journey to Augsburg. The <i>Venus with the Organ Player</i>
has
been overrated; there are things in this canvas which we cannot without
offence to Titian ascribe to his own brush. Among these are the
tiresome,
formal landscape, the wooden little dog petted by Venus, and perhaps
some other passages. The goddess herself and the amorous Ottavio,
though this last is not a very striking or successful portrait, may
perhaps
<a name="Page_67"></a>be left to the master. He vindicates himself more
completely than
in any other passage of the work when he depicts the youthful, supple
form of the Venetian courtesan, as in a merely passive pose she
personates
the goddess whose insignificant votary she really is. It cannot be
denied
that he touches here the lowest level reached by him in such
delineations.
What offends in this <i>Venus with the Organ Player</i>, or rather <i>Ottavio
Farnese with his Beloved</i>, is that its informing sentiment is not
love,
or indeed any community of sentiment, but an ostentatious pride in the
possession of covetable beauty subdued like that of Dana&euml; herself
by gold.</p>
<p>If we are to assume with Crowe and Cavalcaselle that the single
figure <i>Ecce Homo</i> of the Prado Gallery was the piece taken by
the master to
Charles V. when, at the bidding of the Emperor, he journeyed to
Augsburg,
we can only conclude that his design was carried out by pupils or
assistants. The execution is not such as we can ascribe to the brush
which is so shortly to realise for the monarch a group of masterpieces.</p>
<p>It was in January 1548 that Titian set forth to obey the command of
the Emperor, "per far qualche opera," as Count Girolamo della Torre
has it in a letter of recommendation given to Titian for the Cardinal
of
Trent at Augsburg. It is significant to find the writer mentioning the
painter, not by any of the styles and titles which he had a right to
bear,
especially at the court of Charles V., but extolling him as "Messer
Titiano Pittore et il primo huomo della Christianita."<a
 name="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>
<p>It might be imagined that it would be a terrible wrench for Titian,
at the age of seventy, to transplant himself suddenly, and for the
first
time, into a foreign land. But then he was not as other men of seventy
are. The final years of his unexampled career will conclusively show
that he preserved his mental and physical vigour to the end. Further,
the imperial court with its Spanish etiquette, its Spanish language and
manners, was much the same at Augsburg as he had known it on
previous occasions at Bologna. Moreover, Augsburg and Nuremberg<a
 name="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
had, during the last fifty years, been in close touch with Venice in
all
matters appertaining to art and commerce. Especially the great banking
<a name="Page_68"></a>house of the Fuggers had the most intimate
relations with the queen-city
of the Adriatic. Yet art of the two great German cities would doubtless
appeal less to the Venetian who had arrived at the zenith of his
development
than it would and did to the Bellinis and their school at the beginning
of the century. The gulf had become a far wider one, and the
points of contact were fewer.</p>
<p>The trusted Orazio had been left behind, notwithstanding the success
which he had achieved during the Roman tour, and it may be assumed
that he presided over the studio and workshop at Biri Grande during his
father's absence. Titian was accompanied to Augsburg by his second
cousin, Cesare Vecellio,<a name="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>
who no doubt had a minor share in very many
of the canvases belonging to the period of residence at Augsburg. Our
master's first and most grateful task must have been the painting of
the
great equestrian portrait of the Emperor at the Battle of
M&uuml;hlberg,
which now hangs in the Long Gallery of the Prado at Madrid. It suffered
much injury in the fire of the Pardo Palace, which annihilated so many
masterpieces, but is yet very far from being the "wreck" which, with
an exaggeration not easily pardonable under the circumstances, Crowe
and Cavalcaselle have described it. In the presence of one of the
world's
masterpieces criticism may for once remain silent, willingly renouncing
all its rights. No purpose would be served here by recording how much
paint has been abraded in one corner, how much added in another. A
deep sense of thankfulness should possess us that the highest
manifestation
of Titian's genius has been preserved, even though it be shorn of
some of its original beauty. Splendidly armed in steel from head to
foot,
and holding firmly grasped in his hand the spear, emblem of command
in this instance rather than of combat, C&aelig;sar advances with a
mien
impassive yet of irresistible domination. He bestrides with ease his
splendid dark-brown charger, caparisoned in crimson, and heavily
weighted
like himself with the full panoply of battle, a perfect harmony being
here
subtly suggested between man and beast. The rich landscape, with a
gleam
of the Elbe in the distance, is still in the half gloom of earliest
day; but
on the horizon, and in the clouds overhead, glows the red ominous light
of
<a name="Page_69"></a>sunrise, colouring the veils of the morning mist.
The Emperor is alone&#8212;alone
as he must be in life and in death&#8212;a man, yet lifted so high above
other men that the world stretches far below at his feet, while above
him
this ruler knows no power but that of God. It is not even the sneer of
cold command, but a majesty far higher and more absolutely convinced
<a name="Page_70"></a>of its divine origin, that awes the beholder as
he gazes. In comparison
with the supreme dignity of this ugly, pallid Hapsburger, upon whom
disease and death have already laid a shadowy finger, how artificial
appear the divine assumptions of an Alexander, how theatrical the
Olympian
airs of an Augustus, how merely vulgar and ill-worn the imperial poses
of a Napoleon.</p>

<p>No veracious biographer of Titian could pretend that he is always
thus imaginative, that coming in contact with a commanding human
individuality he always thus unfolds the outer wrappings to reveal the
soul within. Indeed, especially in the middle time just past, he not
infrequently contents himself with the splendid outsides of splendid
things. To interpret this masterpiece as the writer has ventured to do,
it is not necessary to assume that Titian reasoned out the poetic
vision,
which was at the same time an absolutely veracious presentment,
argumentatively
with himself, as the painter of such a portrait in words might
have done. Pictorial genius of the creative order does not proceed by
such methods, but sees its subject as a whole, leaving to others the
task
of probing and unravelling. It should be borne in mind, too, that this
is the first in order, as it is infinitely the greatest and the most
significant
among the vast equestrian portraits of monarchs by court painters.
Velazquez on the one hand, and Van Dyck on the other, have worked
wonders in the same field. Yet their finest productions, even the
<i>Philip IV.</i>, the <i>Conde Duque Olivarez</i>, the <i>Don
Balthasar Carlos</i> of
the Spaniard, even the two equestrian portraits of Charles I., the <i>Francisco
de Moncada</i>, the <i>Prince Thomas of Savoy</i> of the Fleming, are
in comparison
but magnificent show pieces aiming above all at decorative pomp
and an imposing general effect.</p>
<p>We come to earth and every-day weariness again with the full-length
of Charles V., which is now in the Alte Pinakothek of Munich.
Here the monarch, dressed in black and seated in a well-worn crimson
velvet chair, shows without disguise how profoundly he is ravaged by
ill-health and <i>ennui</i>. Fine as the portrait still appears
notwithstanding
its bad condition, one feels somehow that Titian is not in this
instance, as
he is in most others, perfect master of his material, of the main
elements
of his picture. The problem of relieving the legs cased in black
against a
relatively light background, and yet allowing to them their full
plastic
<a name="Page_71"></a>form, is not perfectly solved. Neither is it, by
the way, as a rule in the
canvases of those admirable painters of men, the quasi-Venetians,
Moretto
of Brescia and Moroni of Bergamo. The Northerners&#8212;among them
Holbein and Lucidel&#8212;came nearer to perfect success in this particular
matter. The splendidly brushed-in prospect of cloudy sky and
far-stretching
country recalls, as Morelli has observed, the landscapes of
Rubens, and suggests that he underwent the influence of the Cadorine
in this respect as in many others, especially after his journey as
ambassador
to Madrid.</p>
<p>Another portrait, dating from the first visit to Augsburg, is the
half-length of the Elector John Frederick of Saxony, now in the
Imperial
Gallery at Vienna. He sits obese and stolid, yet not without the
dignity
that belongs to absolute simplicity, showing on his left cheek the
wound
received at the battle of M&uuml;hlberg. The picture has, as a portrait
by
Titian, no very commanding merit, no seduction of technique, and it is
easy to imagine that Cesare Vecellio may have had a share in it.
Singular
is the absence of all pose, of all attempt to harmonise the main lines
of the
design or give pictorial elegance to the na&iuml;ve directness of the
presentment. This mode of conception may well have been dictated to the
courtly Venetian by sturdy John Frederick himself.</p>
<p>The master painted for Mary, Queen Dowager of Hungary, four
canvases specially mentioned by Vasari, <i>Prometheus Bound to the
Rock,
Ixion, Tantalus</i>, and <i>Sisyphus</i>, which were taken to Spain at
the
moment of the definitive migration of the court in 1556. Crowe and
Cavalcaselle state that the whole four perished in the all-devouring
conflagration of the Pardo Palace, and put down the <i>Prometheus</i>
and
<i>Sisyphus</i> of the Prado Gallery as copies by Sanchez Coello. It is
difficult
to form a definite judgment on canvases so badly hung, so darkened and
injured. They certainly look much more like Venetian originals than
Spanish copies. These mythological subjects may very properly be
classed with the all too energetic ceiling-pictures now in the Sacristy
of
the Salute. Here again the master, in the effort to be grandiose in a
style not properly his, overreaches himself and becomes artificial.
He must have left Augsburg this time in the autumn of 1548, since
in the month of October of that year we find him at Innsbruck making
a family picture of the children of King Ferdinand, the Emperor's
<a name="Page_72"></a>brother. That monarch himself, his two sons and
five daughters, he
had already portrayed.</p>
<p>Much feasting, much rejoicing, in the brilliant and jovial circle
presided over by Aretino and the brother Triumvirs, followed upon our
master's return to Venice. Aretino, who after all was not so much the
scourge as the screw of princes, would be sure to think the more highly
of the friend whom he really cherished in all sincerity, when he
returned
from close and confidential intercourse with the mightiest ruler of the
age, the source not only of honour but of advantages which the Aretine,
like Falstaff, held more covetable because more substantial. To the
year
1549 belongs the gigantic woodcut <i>The Destruction of Pharaoh's Host</i>,
designed, according to the inscription on the print, by "the great and
immortal Titian," and engraved by Domenico delle Greche, who,
notwithstanding his name, calls himself "depentore Venetiano." He is
not, as need hardly be pointed out, to be confounded with the famous
Veneto-Spanish painter, Domenico Theotocopuli, Il Greco, whose date of
birth is just about this time (1548).</p>
<p>Titian, specially summoned by the Emperor, travelled back to
Augsburg in November 1550. Charles had returned thither with Prince
Philip, the heir-presumptive of the Spanish throne, and it can hardly
be
open to question that one of the main objects for which the court
painter was made to undertake once more the arduous journey across
the Alps was to depict the son upon whom all the monarch's hopes
and plans were centred. Charles, whose health had still further
declined,
was now, under an accumulation of political misfortune, gloomier than
ever before, more completely detached from the things of the world.
Barely over fifty at this moment, he seemed already, and, in truth, was
an old man, while the master of Cadore at seventy-three shone in the
splendid autumn of his genius, which even then had not reached its
final period of expansion. Titian enjoyed the confidence of his
imperial
master during this second visit in a degree which excited surprise at
the
time; the intercourse with Charles at this tragic moment of his career,
when, sick and disappointed, he aspired only to the consolations of
faith,
seeing his sovereign remedy in the soothing balm of utter peace, may
have worked to deepen the gloom which was overspreading the painter's
art if not his soul. It is not to be believed, all the same, that this
<a name="Page_73"></a>atmosphere of unrest and misgiving, of faith
coloured by an element of
terror, in itself operated so strongly as unaided to give a final form
to
Titian's sacred works. There was in this respect kinship of spirit
between the mighty ruler and his servant; Titian's art had already
become sadder and more solemn, had already shown a more sombre
passion. The tragic gloom is now to become more and more intense,
until we come to the climax in the astonishing <i>Piet&agrave;</i>
left unfinished
when the end comes a quarter of a century later still.</p>
<p>And with this change in the whole atmosphere of the sacred art comes
another in the inverse sense, which, being an essential trait, must be
described, though to do so is not quite easy. Titian becomes more and
more merely sensuous in his conception of the beauty of women. He
betrays in his loss of serenity that he is less than heretofore
impervious
to the stings of an invading sensuality, which serves to make of his
mythological and erotic scenes belonging to this late time a tribute to
the glories of the flesh unennobled by the gilding touch of the purer
flame.
And the painter who, when Charles V. retired into his solitude, had
suffered
the feeble flame of his life to die slowly out, was to go on working
for
King Philip, as fierce in the intensity of his physical passion as in
the
fervour of his faith, would receive encouragement to develop to the
full
these seemingly conflicting tendencies of sacred and amorous passion.</p>
<p>The Spanish prince whom it was the master's most important task on
this occasion to portray was then but twenty-four years of age, and
youth
served not indeed to hide, but in a slight measure to attenuate, some
of
his most characteristic physical defects. His unattractive person even
then, however, showed some of the most repellent peculiarities of his
father and his race. He had the supreme distinction of Charles but not
his majesty, more than his haughty reserve, even less than his power
of enlisting sympathy. In this most difficult of tasks&#8212;the portrayal
that should be at one and the same time true in its essence,
distinguished,
and as sympathetic as might be under the circumstances, of so unlovable
a
personage&#8212;Titian won a new victory. His <i>Prince Philip of Austria in
Armour</i> at the Prado is one of his most complete and satisfying
achievements, from every point of view. A veritable triumph of art, but
as usual a triumph to which the master himself disdains to call
attention,
is the rendering of the damascened armour, the puffed hose, and the
<a name="Page_74"></a>white silk stockings and shoes. The two most
important variations
executed by the master, or under his immediate direction, are the
full-lengths of the Pitti Palace and the Naples Museum, in both of
which
sumptuous court-dress replaces the gala military costume. They are
practically identical, both in the design and the working out, save
that in
the Florence example Philip stands on a grass plot in front of a
colonnade,
while in that of Naples the background is featureless. As the pictures
are now seen, that in the Pitti is marked by greater subtlety in the
characterisation of the head, while the Naples canvas appears the more
brilliant as regards the working out of the costume and accessories.</p>
<p>To the period of Titian's return from the second visit to Augsburg
belongs a very remarkable portrait which of late years there has been
some disinclination to admit as his own work. This is the imposing
full-length portrait which stands forth as the crowning decoration of
the beautiful and well-ordered gallery at Cassel. In the days when
it was sought to obtain <i>quand m&ecirc;me</i> a striking designation
for a great
picture, it was christened <i>Alfonso d'Avalos, Marqu&eacute;s del
Vasto</i>. More
recently, with some greater show of probability, it has been called
<i>Guidobaldo II., Duke of Urbino</i>. In the <i>Jahrbuch der
k&ouml;niglich-preussischen
Kunstsammlungen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
Herr Carl Justi, ever bold and ingenious in
hypothesis, strives, with the support of a mass of corroborative
evidence
that cannot be here quoted, to prove that the splendid personage
presented is a Neapolitan nobleman of the highest rank, Giovan
Francesco Acquaviva, Duke of Atri. There is the more reason to
accept his conjecture since it helps us to cope with certain
difficulties
presented by the picture itself. It may be conceded at the outset
that there are disturbing elements in it, well calculated to give pause
to the student of Titian. The handsome patrician, a little too proud
of his rank, his magnificent garments and accoutrements, his virile
beauty, stands fronting the spectator in a dress of crimson and gold,
wearing a plumed and jewelled hat, which in its elaboration closely
borders
on the grotesque, and holding a hunting-spear. Still more astonishing
in
its exaggeration of a Venetian mode in portraiture<a name="FNanchor_44"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> is the great crimson,
<a name="Page_75"></a>dragon-crowned helmet which, on the left of the
canvas, Cupid himself
supports. To the right, a rival even of Love in the affections of our
enigmatical personage, a noble hound rubs himself affectionately
against the stalwart legs of his master. Far back stretches a prospect
singularly unlike those rich-toned studies of sub-Alpine regions in
which Titian as a rule revels. It has an august but more colourless
beauty recalling the middle Apennines; one might almost say that it
prefigures those prospects of inhospitable Sierra which, with their
light,
delicate tonality, so admirably relieve and support the portraits of
Velazquez. All this is unusual, and still more so is the want of that
aristocratic gravity, of that subordination of mere outward splendour
to inborn dignity, which mark Titian's greatest portraits throughout
his career. The splendid materials for the picture are not as
absolutely
digested, as absolutely welded into one consistent and harmonious
whole,
as with such authorship one would expect. But then, on the other
hand, take the magnificent execution in the most important passages:
the distinguished silvery tone obtained notwithstanding the complete
red-and-gold costume and the portentous crimson helmet; the masterly
brush-work in these last particulars, in the handsome virile head of
the
model and the delicate flesh of the <i>amorino</i>. The dog might
without
exaggeration be pronounced the best, the truest in movement, to be
found in Venetian art&#8212;indeed, in art generally, until Velazquez
appears.
Herr Carl Justi's happy conjecture helps us, if we accept it, to get
over
some of these difficulties and seeming contradictions. The Duke of
Atri belonged to a great Neapolitan family, exiled and living at the
French court under royal countenance and protection. The portrait was
painted to be sent back to France, to which, indeed, its whole
subsequent
history belongs. Under such circumstances the young nobleman would
naturally desire to affirm his rank and pretensions as emphatically as
might be; to outdo in splendour and <i>prestance</i> all previous
sitters to
Titian; to record himself apt in war, in the chase, in love, and more
choice in the fashion of his appointments than any of his compeers in
France or Italy.</p>
<p>An importance to which it is surely not entitled in the life-work of
the master is given to the portrait of the Legate Beccadelli, executed
in
the month of July 1552, and included among the real and fancied
<a name="Page_76"></a>masterpieces of the Tribuna in the Uffizi. To the
writer it has always
appeared the most nearly tiresome and perfunctory of Titian's more
important works belonging to the same class. Perhaps the elaborate
legend
inscribed on the paper held by the prelate, including the unusual form
of
signature "Titianus Vecellius faciebat Venetiis MDLII, mense Julii,"
may have been the cause that the canvas has attracted an undue share of
attention.<a name="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
At p. 218 of Crowe and Cavalcaselle's second volume we
get, under date the 11th of October 1552, Titian's first letter to
Philip
of Spain. There is mention in it of a <i>Queen of Persia</i>, which
the artist
does not expressly declare to be his own work, and of a <i>Landscape</i>
and
<i>St. Margaret</i> previously sent by Ambassador Vargas ("... il
Paesaggio
et il ritratto di Sta. Margarita mandatovi per avanti"). The comment
of the biographers on this is that "for the first time in the annals of
Italian painting we hear of a picture which claims to be nothing more
than a landscape, etc." Remembering, however, that when in 1574, at
the end of his life, our master sent in to Philip's secretary, Antonio
Perez, a list of paintings delivered from time to time, but not paid
for,
he described the <i>Venere del Pardo</i>, or <i>Jupiter and Antiope</i>,
as "La nuda
con il paese con el satiro," would it not be fair to assume that the
description <i>Il Paesaggio et il ritratto di Sta. Margarita</i> means
one and
the same canvas&#8212;<i>The Figure of St. Margaret in a Landscape</i>? Thus
should we be relieved from the duty of searching among the authentic
works of the master of Cadore for a landscape pure and simple, and
in the process stumbling across a number of spurious and doubtful
things.
The <i>St. Margaret</i> is evidently the picture which, having been
many
years at the Escorial, now hangs in the Prado Gallery. Obscured and
<a name="Page_77"></a>darkened though it is by the irreparable outrages
of time, it may be
taken as a very characteristic example of Titian's late but not latest
manner in sacred art. In the most striking fashion does it exhibit that
peculiar gloom and agitation of the artist face to face with religious
subjects which at an earlier period would have left his serenity undis<a
 name="Page_78"></a>turbed.
The saint, uncertain of her triumph, armed though she is with
the Cross, flees in affright from the monster whose huge bulk looms,
terrible even in overthrow, in the darkness of the foreground. To the
impression of terror communicated by the whole conception the distance
of the lurid landscape&#8212;a city in flames&#8212;contributes much.</p>

<p>In the spring and summer of 1554 were finished for Philip of Spain
the <i>Dana&euml;</i> of Madrid; for Mary, Queen of Hungary, a <i>Madonna
Addolorata</i>;
for Charles V. the <i>Trinity</i>, to which he had with Titian devoted
so much anxious thought. The <i>Dana&euml;</i> of the Prado, less
grandiose, less
careful in finish than the Naples picture, is painted with greater
spontaneity
and <i>&eacute;lan</i> than its predecessor, and vibrates with an
undisguisedly
fleshly passion. Is it to the taste of Philip or to a momentary touch
of
cynicism in Titian himself that we owe the deliberate dragging down of
the conception until it becomes symbolical of the lowest and most venal
form of love? In the Naples version Amor, a fairly-fashioned divinity
of more or less classic aspect, presides; in the Madrid and subsequent
interpretations of the legend, a grasping hag, the attendant of
Dana&euml;, holds
out a cloth, eager to catch her share of the golden rain. In the St.
Petersburg version, which cannot be accounted more than an atelier
piece, there is, with some slight yet appreciable variations, a
substantial
agreement with the Madrid picture. Of this Hermitage <i>Dana&euml;</i>
there
is a replica in the collection of the Duke of Wellington at Apsley
House.
In yet another version (also a contemporary atelier piece), which is in
the Imperial Gallery at Vienna, and has for that reason acquired a
certain
celebrity, the greedy duenna is depicted in full face, and holds aloft
a
chased metal dish.</p>
<p>Satisfaction of a very different kind was afforded to Queen Mary of
Hungary and Charles V. The lady obtained a <i>Christ appearing to the
Magdalen</i>, which was for a long time preserved at the Escorial,
where
there is still to be found a bad copy of it. A mere fragment of the
original, showing a head and bust of Christ holding a hoe in his left
hand,
has been preserved, and is now No. 489 in the gallery of the Prado.
Even this does not convince the student that Titian's own brush had a
predominant share in the performance. The letter to Charles V., dated
from Venice the 10th of September 1554, records the sending of a
<i>Madonna Addolorata</i> and the great <i>Trinity</i>. These,
together with another
<a name="Page_79"></a><i>Virgen de los Dolores</i> ostensibly by
Titian, and the <i>Ecce Homo</i> already
mentioned, formed afterwards part of the small collection of devotional
paintings taken by Charles to his monastic retreat at Yuste, and
appropriated
after his death by Philip. If the picture styled <i>La Dolorosa</i>,
and now
No. 468 in the gallery of the Prado, is indeed the one painted for the
great monarch who was so sick in body and spirit, so fast declining to
his end, the suspicion is aroused that the courtly Venetian must have
acted with something less than fairness towards his great patron, since
the <i>Addolorata</i> cannot be acknowledged as his own work. Still
less
can we accept as his own that other <i>Virgen de los Dolores</i>, now
No. 475
in the same gallery.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a name="Landscape"></a><img
 style="width: 512px; height: 363px;"
 alt="Landscape drawing in pen and bistre by Titian."
 title="Landscape drawing in pen and bistre by Titian."
 src="images/image22.jpg"></p>
<p>It is very different with the <i>Trinity</i>, called in Spain <i>La
Gloria</i>,
and now No. 462 in the same gallery. Though the master must
have been hampered by the express command that the Emperor should
be portrayed as newly arisen from the grave and adoring the <i>Trinity</i>
in an agony of prayer, and with him the deceased Empress Isabel,
Queen Mary of Hungary, and Prince Philip, also as suppliants, he
succeeded in bringing forth not indeed a complete masterpiece, but a
picture all aspiration and fervent prayer&#8212;just the work to satisfy the
yearnings of the man who, once the mightiest, was then the loneliest
and saddest of mortals on earth. The crown and climax of the whole
is the group of the Trinity itself, awful in majesty, dazzling in the
golden
radiance of its environment, and, beautifully linking it with
mortality,
the blue-robed figure of the Virgin, who stands on a lower eminence of
cloud as she intercedes for the human race, towards whom her pitying
gaze is directed. It would be absurd to pretend that we have here a
work entitled, in virtue of the perfect achievement of all that has
been
sought for, to rank with such earlier masterpieces as the <i>Assunta</i>
or the
<i>St. Peter Martyr</i>. Yet it represents in one way sacred art of a
higher,
a more inspired order, and contains some pictorial beauties&#8212;such as
the great central group&#8212;of which Titian would not in those earlier days
have been equally capable.</p>
<p>There is another descent, though not so marked a one as in the case
of the <i>Dana&euml;</i>, with the <i>Venus and Adonis</i> painted
for Philip, the new
King-Consort of England, and forwarded by the artist to London in
the autumn of 1554. That the picture now in the <i>Sala de la Reina
<a name="Page_80"></a>Isabel</i> at Madrid is this original is proved,
in the first place, by the
quality of the flesh-painting, the silvery shimmer, the vibration of
the
whole, the subordination of local colour to general tone, yet by no
means
to the point of extinction&#8212;all these being distinctive qualities of
this
late time. It is further proved by the fact that it still shows traces
of
the injury of which Philip complained when he received the picture in
London. A long horizontal furrow is clearly to be seen running right
across the canvas. Apart from the consideration that pupils no doubt
had a hand in the work, it lacks, with all its decorative elegance and
felicity of movement, the charm with which Titian, both much earlier
in his career and later on towards the end, could invest such
mythological
subjects.<a name="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>
That the aim of the artist was not a very high one, or this
<i>poesia</i> very near to his heart, is demonstrated by the amusingly
material
fashion in which he recommends it to his royal patron. He says that "if
in the <i>Dana&euml;</i> the forms were to be seen front-wise, here
was occasion to
look at them from a contrary direction&#8212;a pleasant variety for the
ornament of a <i>Camerino</i>." Our worldly-wise painter evidently
knew that
material allurements as well as supreme art were necessary to captivate
Philip. It cannot be alleged, all the same, that this purely sensuous
mode
of conception was not perfectly in consonance with his own temperament,
with his own point of view, at this particular stage in his life and
practice.</p>
<p>The new Doge Francesco Venier had, upon his accession in 1554,
called upon Titian to paint, besides his own portrait, the orthodox
votive picture of his predecessor Marcantonio Trevisan, and this
official performance was duly completed in January 1555, and hung in
the Sala de' Pregadi. At the same time Venier determined that thus
tardily the memory of a long&#8212;deceased Doge, Antonio Grimani, should
be rehabilitated by the dedication to him of a similar but more
dramatic and allusive composition. The commission for this piece also
was given to Titian, who made good progress with it, yet for reasons
unexplained never carried the important undertaking to completion. It
remained in the workshop at the time of his death, and was
completed&#8212;with
what divergence from the original design we cannot authoritatively
<a name="Page_81"></a>say&#8212;by assistants. Antonio Grimani, supported by
members of his
house, or officers attached to his person, kneels in adoration before
an
emblematic figure of Faith which appears in the clouds holding the
cross and chalice, which winged child-angels help to support, and
haloed round with an oval glory of cherubim&#8212;a conception, by
the way, quite new and not at all orthodox. To the left appears
a majestic figure of St. Mark, while the clouds upon which Faith
is upborne, rise just sufficiently to show a very realistic prospect of
Venice. There is not to be found in the whole life-work of Titian a
clumsier or more disjointed composition as a whole, even making the
necessary allowances for alterations, additions, and restorations.
Though
the figure of Faith is a sufficiently noble conception in itself, the
group which it makes with the attendant angels is inexplicably
heavy and awkward in arrangement; the flying <i>pulli</i> have none of
the audacious grace and buoyancy that Lotto or Correggio would
have imparted to them, none of the rush of Tintoretto. The noble
figure of St. Mark must be of Titian's designing, but is certainly not
of
his painting, while the corresponding figure on the other side is
neither
the one nor the other. Some consolation is afforded by the figure of
the
kneeling Doge himself, which is a masterpiece&#8212;not less in the happy
expression of na&iuml;ve adoration than in the rendering, with
matchless
breadth and certainty of brush, of burnished armour in which is
mirrored
the glow of the Doge's magnificent state robes.</p>

unfinished "Piet&agrave;"&#8212;Death of Titian</i>.</h4>
<br>
<p>It was in the month of March 1555 that Titian married his only
daughter Lavinia to Cornelio Sarcinelli of Serravalle, thus leaving the
pleasant home at Biri Grande without a mistress; for his sister Orsa
had
been dead since 1549.<a name="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>
It may be convenient to treat here of the various
portraits and more or less idealised portrait-pieces in which Titian
has
immortalised the thoroughly Venetian beauty of his daughter. First we
have
in the great <i>Ecce Homo</i> of Vienna the graceful white-robed
figure of a young
girl of some fourteen years, placed, with the boy whom she guards, on
the
steps of Pilate's palace. Then there is the famous piece <i>Lavinia
with a
Dish of Fruit</i>, dating according to Morelli from about 1549, and
painted
for the master's friend Argentina Pallavicino of Reggio. This
last-named
work passed in 1821 from the Solly Collection into the Berlin
Gallery. Though its general aspect is splendidly decorative, though
it is accounted one of the most popular of all Titian's works, the
Berlin picture cannot be allowed to take the highest rank among
his performances of the same class. Its fascinations are of the
obvious and rather superficial kind, its execution is not equal in
vigour,
<a name="Page_83"></a>freedom, and accent to the best that the master
did about the same
time. It is pretty obvious here that only the head is adapted from that
of Lavinia, the full-blown voluptuous form not being that of the
youthful
maiden, who could not moreover have worn this sumptuous and fanciful
costume except in the studio. In the strongest contrast to the
conscious
allurement of this showpiece is the demure simplicity of mien in the
avowed
portrait <i>Lavinia as a Bride</i> in the Dresden Gallery. In this
last she wears
a costume of warm white satin and a splendid necklace and earrings of
pearls.
Morelli has pointed out that the fan, in the form of a little flag
which she
holds, was only used in Venice by newly betrothed ladies; and this
fixes the
time of the portrait as 1555, the date of the marriage contract. The
execution is beyond all comparison finer here, the colour more
transparent
in its warmth, than in the more celebrated Berlin piece. Quite eight or
ten
years later than this must date the <i>Salome</i> of the Prado
Gallery, which is in
general design a variation of the <i>Lavinia</i> of Berlin. The figure
holding
up&#8212;a grim substitute for the salver of fruit&#8212;the head of St. John on a
charger has probably been painted without any fresh reference to the
model.
The writer is unable to agree with Crowe and Cavalcaselle when they
affirm
that this <i>Salome</i> is certainly painted by one of the master's
followers. The
touch is assuredly Titian's own in the very late time, and the canvas,
though much slighter and less deliberate in execution than its
predecessors,
is in some respects more spontaneous, more vibrant in touch. Second to
none as a work of art&#8212;indeed more striking than any in the na&iuml;ve
and
fearless truth of the rendering&#8212;is the <i>Lavinia Sarcinelli as a
Matron</i> in
the Dresden Gallery. Morelli surely exaggerates a little when he
describes
Lavinia here as a woman of forty. Though the demure, bright-eyed
maiden has grown into a self-possessed Venetian dame of portentous
dimensions, Sarcinelli's spouse is fresh still, and cannot be more than
two-or
three-and-thirty. This assumption, if accepted, would fix the time
of origin of the picture at about 1565, and, reasoning from analogies
of
technique, this appears to be a more acceptable date than the year
1570-72, at which Morelli would place it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><a name="Titians_Daughter_Lavinia"></a><img

 title="Titian's Daughter Lavinia." src="images/image23.jpg"></i></p>
<p>One of the most important chapters in our master's life closed with
the death of Aretino, which took place suddenly on the 21st of October
1556. He had been sitting at table with friends far into the night
or morning. One of them, describing to him a farcical incident of
<a name="Page_84"></a>Rabelaisian quality, he threw himself back in his
chair in a fit of laughter,
and slipping on the polished floor, was thrown with great force on his
head and killed almost instantaneously. This was indeed the violent and
sudden death of the strong, licentious man; poetic justice could have
devised no more fitting end to such a life.</p>
<p>In the year 1558 Crowe and Cavalcaselle, for very sufficient
reasons, place
the <i>Martyrdom of St. Lawrence</i>, now preserved in the hideously
over-ornate
Church of the Jesuits at Venice. To the very remarkable analysis which
they furnish of this work, the writer feels unable to add anything
appreciable
by way of comment, for the simple reason that though he has seen it
many times, on no occasion has he been fortunate enough to obtain such
a
light as would enable him to judge the picture on its own merits as it
now stands.<a name="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
Of a design more studied in its rhythm, more akin to the
Florentine and Roman schools, than anything that has appeared since the
<i>St. Peter Martyr</i>, with a <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> more
classical than anything else
from Titian's hand that can be pointed to, the picture may be guessed,
rather than seen, to be also a curious and subtle study of conflicting
lights. On the one hand we have that of the gruesome martyrdom
itself, and of a huge torch fastened to the carved shaft of a pedestal;
on the other, that of an effulgence from the skies, celestial in
brightness,
shedding its consoling beams on the victim.</p>
<p>The <i>Christ crowned with Thorns</i>, which long adorned the
church of
S. Maria delle Grazie at Milan, and is now in the Long Gallery of the
Louvre, may belong to about this time, but is painted with a larger and
more generous brush, with a more spontaneous energy, than the carefully
studied piece at the Gesuiti. The tawny harmonies finely express in
their calculated absence of freshness the scene of brutal and unholy
violence so dramatically enacted before our eyes. The rendering of
muscle, supple and strong under the living epidermis, the glow of the
flesh, the dramatic momentariness of the whole, have not been surpassed
even by Titian. Of the true elevation, of the spiritual dignity that
the
subject calls for, there is, however, little or nothing. The finely
limbed
Christ is as coarse in type and as violent in action as his
executioners;
sublimity is reached, strange to say, only in the bust of Tiberius,
which
<a name="Page_85"></a>crowns the rude archway through which the figures
have issued into the
open space. Titian is here the precursor of the <i>Naturalisti</i>&#8212;of
Caravaggio and his school. Yet, all the same, how immeasurable is the
distance between the two!</p>

<p>On the 21st of September 1558 died the imperial recluse of Yuste,
once
<a name="Page_86"></a>Charles V., and it is said his last looks were
steadfastly directed towards
that great canvas <i>The Trinity</i>, which to devise with Titian had
been one of
his greatest consolations at a moment when already earthly glories held
him no more. Philip, on the news of his father's death, retired for
some
weeks to the monastery of Groenendale, and thence sent a despatch to
the
Governor of Milan, directing payment of all the arrears of the pensions
"granted to Titian by Charles his father (now in glory)," adding by way
of unusual favour a postscript in his own hand.<a name="FNanchor_49"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> Orazio Vecellio,
despatched by his father in the spring of 1559 to Milan to receive the
arrears of pension, accepted the hospitality of the sculptor Leone
Leoni,
who was then living in splendid style in a palace which he had built
and
adorned for himself in the Lombard city. He was the rival in art as
well as the mortal enemy of Benvenuto Cellini, and as great a ruffian
as
he, though one less picturesque in blackguardism. One day early in
June, when Orazio, having left Leoni's house, had returned to
superintend
the removal of certain property, he was set upon, and murderously
assaulted by the perfidious host and his servants. The whole affair is
wrapped in obscurity. It remains uncertain whether vengeance, or hunger
after the arrears of Titian's pension, or both, were the motives which
incited Leoni to attempt the crime. Titian's passionate reclamations,
addressed immediately to Philip II., met with but partial success,
since
the sculptor, himself a great favourite with the court of Spain, was
punished only with fine and banishment, and the affair was afterwards
compromised by the payment of a sum of money.</p>
<p>Titian's letter of September 22, 1559, to Philip II. announces the
despatch of the companion pieces <i>Diana and Calisto</i> and <i>Diana
and
Act&aelig;on</i>, as well as of an <i>Entombment</i> intended to
replace a painting of the
same subject which had been lost on the way. The two celebrated
canvases,<a name="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
now in the Bridgewater Gallery, are so familiar that they need
no new description. Judging by the repetitions, reductions, and copies
<a name="Page_87"></a>that exist in the Imperial Gallery of Vienna, the
Prado Gallery, the
Yarborough Collection, and elsewhere, these mythological <i>poesie</i>
have
captivated the world far more than the fresher and lovelier painted
poems of the earlier time&#8212;the <i>Worship of Venus</i>, the <i>Bacchanal</i>,
the
<i>Bacchus and Ariadne</i>. At no previous period has Titian wielded
the
brush with greater <i>maestria</i> and ease than here, or united a
richer or
more transparent glow with greater dignity of colour. About the
compositions themselves, if we are to take them as the <i>poesie</i>
that
Titian loved to call them, there is a certain want of significance,
neither
the divine nor the human note being struck with any depth or intensity
of
vibration. The glamour, the mystery, the intimate charm of the early
pieces is lost, and there is felt, enwrapping the whole, that sultry
atmosphere
of untempered sensuousness which has already, upon more than
one occasion, been commented upon. That this should be so is only
natural when creative power is not extinguished by old age, but is on
the
contrary coloured with its passion, so different in quality from that
of youth.</p>
<p>The <i>Entombment</i>, which went to Madrid with the mythological
pieces
just now discussed, serves to show how vivid was Titian's imagination
at
this point, when he touched upon a sacred theme, and how little
dependent he was in this field on the conceptions of his earlier prime.
A
more living passion informs the scene, a more intimate sympathy colours
it, than we find in the noble <i>Entombment</i> of the Louvre, much as
the
picture which preceded it by so many years excels the Madrid example
in fineness of balance, in dignity, in splendour and charm of colour.
Here the personages are set free by the master from all academic
trammels,
and express themselves with a greater spontaneity in grief. The colour,
too, of which the general scheme is far less attractive to the eye than
in the Louvre picture, blazes forth in one note of lurid splendour in
the red robe of the saint who supports the feet of the dead Christ.</p>
<p>In this same year Titian painted on the ceiling of the ante-chamber
to
Sansovino's great Library in the Piazzetta the allegorical figure <i>Wisdom</i>,
thus entering into direct competition with young Paolo Veronese,
Schiavone, and the other painters who, striving in friendly rivalry,
had been engaged a short time before on the ceiling of the great
hall in the same building. This noble design contains a pronounced
reminiscence of Raphael's incomparable allegorical figures in the
Camera
<a name="Page_88"></a>della Segnatura, but excels them as much in
decorative splendour
and facile breadth of execution as it falls behind them in sublimity of
inspiration.</p>
<p>Crowe and Cavalcaselle are probably right in assigning the great
<i>Cornaro Family</i> in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland
to the
year 1560 or thereabouts. Little seen of late years, and like most
Venetian pictures of the sixteenth century shorn of some of its glory
by
time and the restorer, this family picture appears to the writer to
rank
among Titian's masterpieces in the domain of portraiture, and to be
indeed the finest portrait-group of this special type that Venice has
produced.
In the simplicity and fervour of the conception Titian rises to
heights which he did not reach in the <i>Madonna di Casa Pesaro</i>,
where
he is hampered by the necessity for combining a votive picture with a
series of avowed portraits. It is pretty clear that this <i>Cornaro</i>
picture,
like the Pesaro altar-piece, must have been commissioned to commemorate
a victory or important political event in the annals of the illustrious
family. Search among their archives and papers, if they still exist,
might
throw light upon this point, and fix more accurately the date of the
magnificent
work. In the open air&#8212;it may be outside some great Venetian
church&#8212;an altar has been erected, and upon it is placed a crucifix, on
either side of which are church candles, blown this way and the other
by the wind. Three generations of patricians kneel in prayer
and thanksgiving, taking precedence according to age, six handsome
boys, arranged in groups of three on either side of the canvas,
furnishing an element of great pictorial attractiveness but no vital
significance. The act of worship acquires here more reality and a
profounder meaning than it can have in those vast altar-pieces in which
the divine favour is symbolised by the actual presence of the Madonna
and Child. An open-air effect has been deliberately aimed at and
attained, the splendid series of portraits being relieved against the
cloud-flecked
blue sky with a less sculptural plasticity than the master would
have given to them in an indoor scheme. This is another admirable
example of the dignity and reserve which Titian combines with sumptuous
colour at this stage of his practice. His mastery is not less but
greater,
subtler, than that of his more showy and brilliant contemporaries of
the
younger generation; the result is something that appears as if it must
<a name="Page_89"></a>inevitably have been so and not otherwise. The
central figure of the
patriarch is robed in deep crimson with grayish fur, rather black in
shadow; the man in the prime of manhood wears a more positive crimson,
trimmed with tawnier fur, browner in shadow; a lighter sheen is on the
brocaded mantle of yet another shade of crimson worn by the most
youthful of the three patricians. Just the stimulating note to break
up a harmony which might otherwise have been of a richness too cloying
is furnished&#8212;in the master's own peculiar way&#8212;by the scarlet
stockings of one boy in the right hand group, by the cinnamon sleeve
of another.<a name="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p>To the year 1561 belongs, according to the elaborate inscription on
the picture, the magnificent <i>Portrait of a Man</i> which is No. 172
in the
Dresden Gallery. It presents a Venetian gentleman in his usual habit,
but bearing a palm branch such as we associate with saints who have
endured martyrdom. Strangely sombre and melancholy in its very
reserve is this sensitive face, and the tone of the landscape echoes
the
pathetic note of disquiet. The canvas bears the signature "Titianus
Pictor et Aeques (sic) Caesaris." There group very well with this
Dresden
picture, though the writer will not venture to assert positively that
they
belong to exactly the same period, the <i>St. Dominic</i> of the
Borghese
Gallery and the <i>Knight of Malta</i> of the Prado Gallery. In all
three&#8212;in
the two secular portraits as in the sacred piece which is also a
portrait&#8212;the
expression given, and doubtless intended, is that of a man who has
withdrawn himself in his time of fullest physical vigour from the pomps
and vanities of the world, and sadly concentrates his thoughts on
matters
of higher import.</p>
<p>On the 1st of December 1561 Titian wrote to the king to announce
the despatch of a <i>Magdalen</i>, which had already been mentioned
more
than once in the correspondence. According to Vasari and subsequent
authorities, Silvio Badoer, a Venetian patrician, saw the masterpiece
on the
painter's easel, and took it away for a hundred scudi, leaving the
master
to paint another for Philip. This last has disappeared, while the
canvas
<a name="Page_90"></a>which remained in Venice cannot be identified
with any certainty. The
finest extant example of this type of <i>Magdalen</i> is undoubtedly
that which
from Titian's ne'er-do-well son, Pompinio, passed to the Barbarigo
family, and ultimately, with the group of Titians forming part of the
Barbarigo collection, found its way into the Imperial Gallery of the
Hermitage at St. Petersburg. This answers in every respect to Vasari's
eloquent description of the <i>magna peccatrix</i>, lovely still in
her penitence.
It is an embodiment of the favourite subject, infinitely finer and more
moving than the much earlier <i>Magdalen</i> of the Pitti, in which
the artist's
sole preoccupation has been the alluring portraiture of exuberant
feminine
charms. This later <i>Magdalen</i>, as Vasari says, "ancorch&egrave;
che sia bellissima,
non muove a lascivia, ma a commiserazione," and the contrary
might, without exaggeration, be said of the Pitti picture.<a
 name="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
Another of
the Barbarigo heirlooms which so passed into the Hermitage is the
ever-popular
<i>Venus with the Mirror</i>, the original of many repetitions and
variations. Here, while one winged love holds the mirror, the other
proffers a crown of flowers, not to the goddess, but to the fairest of
women. The rich mantle of Venetian fashion, the jewels, the coiffure,
all show that an idealised portrait of some lovely Cytherean of Venice,
and no true mythological piece, has been intended.</p>
<p>At this date, or thereabouts, is very generally placed, with the <i>Rape
of Europa</i> presently to be discussed, the <i>Jupiter and Antiope</i>
of the
Louvre, more popularly known as the <i>Venere del Pardo</i>.<a
 name="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
Seeing that the
picture is included in the list<a name="FNanchor_54"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> sent by Titian to Antonio
Perez in 1574,
setting forth the titles of canvases delivered during the last
twenty-five
years, and then still unpaid for, it may well have been completed
somewhere
<a name="Page_91"></a>about the time at which we have arrived. To the
writer it appears
nevertheless that it is in essentials the work of an earlier period,
taken
up and finished thus late in the day for the delectation of the Spanish
king. Seeing that the <i>Venere del Pardo</i> has gone through two
fires&#8212;those
of the Pardo and the Louvre&#8212;besides cleanings, restorations, and
repaintings, even more disfiguring, it would be very unsafe to lay
undue
stress on technique alone. Yet compare the close, sculptural modelling
in
the figure of Antiope with the broader, looser handling in the figure
of
Europa; compare the two landscapes, which are even more divergent in
style. The glorious sylvan prospect, which adds so much freshness and
beauty to the <i>Venere del Pardo</i>, is conspicuously earlier in
manner than,
for instance, the backgrounds to the <i>Diana and Act&aelig;on</i> and
<i>Diana and
Calisto</i> of Bridgewater House. The captivating work is not without
its
faults, chief among which is the curious awkwardness of design which
makes of the composition, cut in two by a central tree, two pictures
instead
<a name="Page_92"></a>of one. Undeniably, too, there is a certain
meanness and triviality in
the little nymph or mortal of the foreground, which may, however, be
due
to the intervention of an assistant. But then, with an elasticity truly
astounding in a man of his great age, the master has momentarily
regained the poetry of his youthful prime, and with it a measure of
that
Giorgionesque fragrance which was evaporating already at the close of
the early time, when the <i>Bacchanals</i> were brought forth. The
Antiope
herself far transcends in the sovereign charm of her beauty&#8212;divine in
the truer sense of the word&#8212;all Titian's Venuses, save the one in the
<i>Sacred and Profane Love</i>. The figure comes in some ways nearer
even
in design, and infinitely nearer in feeling, to Giorgione's <i>Venus</i>
at Dresden
than does the <i>Venus of Urbino</i> in the Tribuna, which was closely
modelled
upon it. And the aged Titian had gone back even a step farther than
Giorgione; the group of Antiope with Jupiter in the guise of a Satyr
is clearly a reminiscence of a <i>Nymph surprised by a Satyr</i>&#8212;one
of the
engravings in the <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i> first published in
1499, but
republished with the same illustrations in 1545.<a name="FNanchor_55"></a><a

<p>According to the correspondence published by Crowe and Cavalcaselle
there were completed for the Spanish King in April 1562 the <i>Poesy
of
Europa carried by the Bull</i>, and the <i>Christ praying in the Garden</i>,
while a
<i>Virgin and Child</i> was announced as in progress.</p>
<p>These paintings, widely divergent as they are in subject, answer
very
well to each other in technical execution, while in both they differ
very materially from the <i>Venere del Pardo</i>. The <i>Rape of
Europa</i>, which
has retained very much of its blond brilliancy and charm of colour,
affords
convincing proof of the unrivalled power with which Titian still
wielded
the brush at this stage which precedes that of his very last and most
impressionistic style. For decorative effect, for "go," for frankness
and
breadth of execution, it could not be surpassed. Yet hardly elsewhere
has the great master approached so near to positive vulgarity as here
in the
conception of the fair Europa as a strapping wench who, with ample
limbs
outstretched, complacently allows herself to be carried off by the
Bull,
making her appeal for succour merely <i>pour la forme</i>. What gulfs
divide
<a name="Page_93"></a><a name="Page_94"></a>this conception from that
of the Antiope, from Titian's earlier renderings
of female loveliness, from Giorgione's supreme Venus!<a

 src="images/image27.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Agony in the Garden</i>, which is still to be found in one
of the
halls of the Escorial, even now in its faded state serves to evidence
the
intensity of religious fervour which possessed Titian when, so late in
life,
he successfully strove to renew the sacred subjects. If the
composition&#8212;as
Crowe and Cavalcaselle assert&#8212;does more or less resemble that of the
famous <i>Agony</i> by Correggio now at Apsley House, nothing could
differ
more absolutely from the Parmese master's amiable virtuosity than the
aged Titian's deep conviction.<a name="FNanchor_57"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>
<p>To the year 1562 belongs the nearly profile portrait of the artist,
painted by himself with a subtler refinement and a truer revelation of
self
than is to be found in those earlier canvases of Berlin and the Uffizi
in
which his late prime still shows as a green and vigorous manhood. This
is now in the <i>Sala de la Reina Isabel</i> of the Prado. The pale
noble
head, refined by old age to a solemn beauty, is that of one brought
face to
face with the world beyond; it is the face of the man who could
conceive
and paint the sacred pieces of the end, the <i>Ecce Homo</i> of Munich
and
the last <i>Piet&agrave;</i>, with an awe such as we here read in his
eyes. Much less
easy is it to connect this likeness with the artist who went on
concurrently
producing his Venuses, mythological pieces, and pastorals, and
joying as much as ever in their production.</p>
<p>Vasari, who, as will be seen, visited Venice in 1566, when he was
preparing that new and enlarged edition of the <i>Lives</i> which was
to appear
in 1568, had then an opportunity of renewing his friendly acquaintance
with the splendid old man whom he had last seen, already well stricken
in years, twenty-one years before in Rome. It must have been at this
stage that he formed the judgment as to the latest manner of Titian
which
is so admirably expressed in his biography of the master. Speaking
<a name="Page_95"></a>especially of the <i>Diana and Act&aelig;on</i>,
the <i>Rape of Europa</i>, and the
<i>Deliverance of Andromeda</i>,<a name="FNanchor_58"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> he delivers himself as
follows:&#8212;"It is
indeed true that his technical manner in these last is very different
from
that of his youth. The first works are, be it remembered, carried out
with incredible delicacy and pains, so that they can be looked at both
at close quarters and from afar. These last ones are done with broad
coarse strokes and blots of colour, in such wise that they cannot be
appreciated near at hand, but from afar look perfect. This style has
been the cause that many, thinking therein to play the imitators and to
make a display of practical skill, have produced clumsy, bad pictures.
This is so, because, notwithstanding that to many it may seem that
Titian's works are done without labour, this is not so in truth, and
they
who think so deceive themselves. It is, on the contrary, to be
perceived
that they are painted at many sittings, that they have been worked upon
with the colours so many times as to make the labour evident; and this
method of execution is judicious, beautiful, astonishing, because it
makes
the pictures seem living."</p>
<p>No better proof could be given of Vasari's genuine <i>flair</i> and
intuition
as a critic of art than this passage. We seem to hear, not the Tuscan
painter bred to regard the style of Michelangelo as an article of
faith, to
imitate his sculptural smoothness of finish and that of Angelo
Bronzino,
but some intelligent exponent of impressionistic methods, defending
both
from attack and from superficial imitation one of the most advanced of
modernists.</p>
<p>Among the sacred works produced in this late time is a <i>Crucifixion</i>,
still preserved in a damaged state in the church of S. Domenico at
Ancona. To a period somewhat earlier than that at which we have
arrived may belong the late <i>Madonna and Child in a Landscape</i>
which is
<a name="Page_96"></a>No. 1113 in the Alte Pinakothek of Munich. The
writer follows
Giovanni Morelli in believing that this is a studio picture touched by
the master, and that the splendidly toned evening landscape is all his.
He cannot surely be made wholly responsible for the overgrown and
inflated figure of the divine <i>Bambino</i>, so disproportionate, so
entirely
wanting in tenderness and charm.</p>
<p>The power of vivid conception, the spontaneous fervour which mark
Titian's latest efforts in the domain of sacred art, are very evident
in the
great <i>St. Jerome</i> of the Brera here reproduced. Cima, Basaiti,
and most
of the Bellinesques had shown an especial affection for the subject,
and it
had been treated too by Lotto, by Giorgione, by Titian himself; but
this
is surely as noble and fervent a rendering as Venetian art in its prime
has
brought forth. Of extraordinary majesty and beauty is the landscape,
with its mighty trees growing out of the abrupt mountain slope, close
to the naked rock.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1564 we actually find the venerable master, then
about eighty-seven years of age, taking a journey to Brescia in
connection
with an important commission given to him for the decoration of the
great hall in the Palazzo Pubblico at Brescia, to which the Vicentine
artist
Righetto had supplied the ceiling, and Palladio had added columns and
interior wall-decorations. The three great ceiling-pictures, which were
afterwards, as a consequence of the contract then entered upon,
executed
by the master, or rather by his assistants, endured only until 1575,
when
in the penultimate year of Titian's life they perished in a great fire.</p>
<p>The correspondence shows that the vast <i>Last Supper</i> painted
for
the Refectory of the Escorial, and still to be found there, was
finished
in October 1564, and that there was much haggling and finessing on the
part of the artist before it was despatched to Spain, the object being
to
secure payment of the arrears of pension still withheld by the Milanese
officials. When the huge work did arrive at the Escorial the monks
perpetrated upon it one of those acts of vandalism of which Titian was
in more than one instance the victim. Finding that the picture would
not fit the particular wall of their refectory for which it had been
destined, they ruthlessly cut it down, slicing off a large piece of the
upper part, and throwing the composition out of balance by the
mutilation of the architectural background.</p>

<p><a name="Page_98"></a>Passing over the <i>Transfiguration</i> on
the high altar of San Salvatore at
Venice, we come to the <i>Annunciation</i> in the same church with the
signature "Titianus fecit fecit," added by the master, if we are to
credit
the legend, in indignation that those who commissioned the canvas
should
have shown themselves dissatisfied even to the point of expressing
incredulity as to his share in the performance. Some doubt has been
cast upon this story, which may possibly have been evolved on the basis
of the peculiar signature. It is at variance with Vasari's statement
that
Titian held the picture in slight esteem in comparison with his other
works. It is not to be contested that for all the fine passages of
colour
and execution, the general tone is paler in its silveriness, less
vibrant and
effective on the whole, than in many of the masterpieces which have
been
mentioned in their turn. But the conception is a novel and magnificent
one, contrasting instructively in its weightiness and majesty with the
more na&iuml;ve and pathetic renderings of an earlier time.</p>
<p>The <i>Education of Cupid</i>, popularly but erroneously known as <i>The
Three Graces</i><a name="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>
is one of the pearls of the Borghese Gallery. It is clearly
built in essentials on the master's own <i>d'Avalos Allegory</i>,
painted many
years before. This later allegory shows Venus binding the eyes of Love
ere he sallies forth into the world, while his bow and his quiver
well-stocked
with arrows are brought forward by two of the Graces. In its
conception there is no great freshness or buoyancy, no pretence at
invention. The aged magician of the brush has interested himself more
in the execution than in the imagining of his picture. It is a fine and
typical specimen of the painting <i>di macchia</i>, which Vasari has
praised
in a passage already quoted. A work such as this bears in technique
much the same relation to the productions of Titian's first period
that the great <i>Family Picture</i> of Rembrandt at Brunswick does to
his work done some thirty-five or forty years before. In both
instances it is a life-time of legitimate practice that has permitted
the old
<a name="Page_99"></a><a name="Page_100"></a>man to indulge without
danger in an abridgment of labour, a synthetic
presentment of fact, which means no abatement, but in some ways an
enhancement of life, breadth, and pictorial effect. To much about the
same time, judging from the handling and the types, belongs the curious
allegory, <i>Religion succoured by Spain</i>&#8212;otherwise <i>La F&eacute;</i>&#8212;now
No. 476
in the gallery of the Prado. This canvas, notwithstanding a marked
superficiality of invention as well as of execution, is in essentials
the
master's own; moreover it can boast its own special decorative
qualities, void though it is of any deep significance. The showy
figure of Spain holding aloft in one hand a standard, and with the
other supporting a shield emblazoned with the arms of the realm,
recalls
the similar creations of Paolo Veronese. Titian has rarely been less
happily inspired than in the figure of Religion, represented as a naked
female slave newly released from bondage.</p>

<p>When Vasari in 1566 paid the visit to Venice, of which a word has
already been said, he noted, among a good many other things then in
progress, the <i>Martyrdom of St. Lawrence</i>, based upon that now at
the
Gesuiti in Venice. This was despatched nearly two years later to the
Escorial, where it still occupies its place on the high altar of the
mighty
church dedicated to St. Lawrence. The Brescian ceiling canvases
appeared, too, in his list as unfinished. They were sent to their
destination
early in 1568, to be utterly destroyed, as has been told, by fire in
1575.</p>
<p>The best proof we have that Titian's artistic power was in many
respects at its highest in 1566, is afforded by the magnificent
portrait of
the Mantuan painter and antiquary Jacopo da Strada, now in the Imperial
Gallery at Vienna. It bears, besides the usual late signature of the
master,
the description of the personage with all his styles and titles, and
the date
MDLXVI. The execution is again <i>di macchia</i>, but magnificent in
vitality, as in impressiveness of general effect, swift but not hasty
or superficial. The reserve and dignity of former male portraits is
exchanged for a more febrile vivacity, akin to that which Lotto had
in so many of his finest works displayed. His peculiar style is further
recalled in the rather abrupt inclination of the figure and the
parallel position
of the statuette which it holds. But none other than Titian himself
could have painted the superb head, which he himself has hardly
surpassed.</p>
<p>It is curious and instructive to find the artist, in a letter
addressed to
<a name="Page_101"></a>Philip on the 2nd of December 1567, announcing
the despatch, together
with the just now described altar-piece, <i>The Martyrdom of St.
Lawrence</i>,
of "una pittura d'una Venere ignuda"&#8212;the painting of a nude Venus.
Thus is the peculiar double current of the aged painter's genius
maintained
by the demand for both classes of work. He well knows that to the
Most Catholic Majesty very secular pieces indeed will be not less
acceptable
than those much-desired sacred works in which now Titian's power of
invention is greatest.</p>

<p>Our master, in his dealings with the Brescians, after the completion
<a name="Page_102"></a>of the extensive decorations for the Palazzo
Pubblico, was to have proof
that Italian citizens were better judges of art than the King of Spain,
and
more grudging if prompter paymasters. They declared, not without some
foundation in fact, that the canvases were not really from the hand of
Titian, and refused to pay more than one thousand ducats for them.
The negotiation was conducted&#8212;as were most others at that time&#8212;by
<a name="Page_103"></a>the trusty Orazio, who after much show of
indignation was compelled
at last to accept the proffered payment.</p>

<p>The great victory of Lepanto, gained by the united fleets of Spain
and Venice over the Turk on the 7th of October 1571, gave fitting
occasion for one of Paolo Veronese's most radiant masterpieces, the
<a name="Page_104"></a>celebrated votive picture of the Sala del
Collegio, for Tintoretto's
<i>Battle of Lepanto</i>, but also for one of Titian's feeblest works,
the
allegory <i>Philip II. offering to Heaven his Son, the Infant Don
Ferdinand</i>,
now No. 470 in the gallery of the Prado. That Sanchez Coello, under
special directions from the king, prepared the sketch which was to
serve
as the basis for the definitive picture may well have hampered and
annoyed
the aged master. Still this is but an insufficient excuse for the
absurdities
of the design, culminating in the figure of the descending angel, who
is
represented in one of those strained, over-bold attitudes, in which
Titian,
even at his best, never achieved complete success. That he was not, all
the same, a stranger to the work, is proved by some flashes of splendid
colour, some fine passages of execution.</p>
<p>In the four pieces now to be shortly described, the very latest and
most
impressionistic form of Titian's method as a painter is to be observed;
all of them are in the highest degree characteristic of this ultimate
phase.
In the beautiful <i>Madonna and Child</i> here reproduced,<a
 name="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> the
hand, though
it no longer works with all trenchant vigour of earlier times, produces
a magical effect by means of unerring science and a certainty
of touch justifying such economy of mere labour as is by the system of
execution suggested to the eye. And then this pathetic motive, the
simple realism, the unconventional treatment of which are spiritualised
by infinite tenderness, is a new thing in Venetian, nay in Italian
art. Precisely similar in execution, and equally restrained in the
scheme of colour adopted, is the <i>Christ crowned with Thorns</i> of
the
Alte Pinakothek at Munich, a reproduction with important variations
of the better-known picture in the Long Gallery of the Louvre. Less
demonstratively and obviously dramatic than its predecessor, the Munich
example is, as a realisation of the scene, far truer and more profound
in
pathos. Nobler beyond compare in His unresisting acceptance of
insult and suffering is the Munich Christ than the corresponding
figure, so violent in its instinctive recoil from pain, of the Louvre
picture.</p>

<p>It is nothing short of startling at the very end of Titian's career
to
<a name="Page_105"></a><a name="Page_106"></a>meet with a work which,
expressed in this masterly late technique of his,
vies in freshness of inspiration with the finest of his early <i>poesie</i>.
This
is the <i>Nymph and Shepherd</i><a name="FNanchor_61"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> of the Imperial Gallery at
Vienna, a picture
which the world had forgotten until it was added, or rather restored,
to
the State collection on its transference from the Belvedere to the
gorgeous
palace which it now occupies. In its almost monochromatic harmony of
embrowned silver the canvas embodies more absolutely than any other,
save perhaps the final <i>Piet&agrave;</i>, the ideal of tone-harmony
towards which the
master in his late time had been steadily tending. Richness and
brilliancy
of local colour are subordinated, and this time up to the point of
effacement,
to this luminous monotone, so mysteriously effective in the hands
of a master such as Titian. In the solemn twilight which descends from
the heavens, just faintly flushed with rose, an amorous shepherd,
flower-crowned,
pipes to a nude nymph, who, half-won by the appealing strain,
turns her head as she lies luxuriously extended on a wild beast's hide,
covering the grassy knoll; in the distance a strayed goat browses on
the
leafage of a projecting branch. It may not be concealed that a note of
ardent sensuousness still makes itself felt, as it does in most of the
later
pieces of the same class. But here, transfigured by a freshness of
poetic
inspiration hardly to be traced in the master's work in pieces of this
order,
since those early Giorgionesque days when the sixteenth century was in
its
youth, it offends no more than does an idyll of Theocritus. Since the
<i>Three Ages</i> of Bridgewater House, divided from the <i>Nymph and
Shepherd</i>
by nearly seventy years of life and labour, Titian had produced nothing
which, apart from the question of technical execution, might so nearly
be
paralleled with that exquisite pastoral. The early <i>poesia</i>
gives, wrapped
in clear even daylight, the perfect moment of trusting, satisfied love;
the late one, with less purity, but, strange to say, with a higher
passion,
renders, beautified by an evening light more solemn and suggestive, the
divine ardours fanned by solitude and opportunity.</p>
<p>And now we come to the <i>Piet&agrave;</i>,<a name="FNanchor_62"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> which so nobly and
appropriately
closes a career unexampled for duration and sustained achievement.
<a name="Page_107"></a>Titian had bargained with the Franciscan monks
of the Frari, which
contained already the <i>Assunta</i> and the <i>Madonna di Casa Pesaro</i>,
for a
grave in the Cappella del Crocifisso, offering in payment a <i>Piet&agrave;</i>,
and this
offer had been accepted. But some misunderstanding and consequent
quarrel having been the ultimate outcome of the proposed arrangements,
he left his great canvas unfinished, and willed that his body should be
taken to Cadore, and there buried in the chapel of the Vecelli.</p>

 title="Piet&agrave;. By Titian and Palma Giovine. Accademia delle Belle Arti, Venice. From a Photograph by E. Alinari."
 src="images/image34.jpg"></p>
<p>The well-known inscription on the base of the monumental niche
which occupies the centre of the <i>Piet&agrave;</i>, "Quod Titianus
inchoatum
reliquit, Palma reverenter absolvit, Deoque dicavit opus," records how
what Titian had left undone was completed as reverently as might be
<a name="Page_108"></a>by Palma Giovine. At this stage&#8212;the question
being much complicated
by subsequent restorations&#8212;the effort to draw the line accurately
between
the work of the master on one hand and that of his able and pious
assistant on the other, would be unprofitable. Let us rather strive
to appreciate what is left of a creation unique in the life-work of
Titian, and in some ways his most sublime invention. Genius alone
could have triumphed over the heterogeneous and fantastic surroundings
in which he has chosen to enframe his great central group. And yet even
these&#8212;the great rusticated niche with the gold mosaic of the pelican
feeding
its young, the statues of Moses on one side and of the Hellespontic
Sibyl on the other&#8212;but serve to heighten the awe of the spectator. The
artificial light is obtained in part from a row of crystal lamps on the
cornice of the niche, in part, too, from the torch borne by the
beautiful
boy-angel who hovers in mid-air, yet another focus of illumination
being
the body of the dead Christ. This system of lighting furnishes just the
luminous half-gloom, the deeply significant chiaroscuro, that the
painter
requires in order to give the most poignant effect to his last and most
thrilling conception of the world's tragedy. As is often the case with
Tintoretto, but more seldom with Titian, the eloquent passion breathed
forth in this <i>Piet&agrave;</i> is not to be accounted for by any
element or elements
of the composition taken separately; it depends to so great an extent
on the poetic suggestiveness of the illumination, on the strange and
indefinable power of evocation that the aged master here exceptionally
commands.</p>
<p>Wonderfully does the terrible figure of the Magdalen contrast in its
excess of passion with the sculptural repose, the permanence of the
main
group. As she starts forward, almost menacing in her grief, her loud
and bitter cry seems to ring through space, accusing all mankind of its
great crime. It is with a conviction far more intense than has ever
possessed him in his prime, with an awe nearly akin to terror, that
Titian,
himself trembling on the verge of eternity, and painting, too, that
which
shall purchase his own grave, has produced this profoundly moving work.
No more fitting end and crown to the great achievements of the master's
old age could well be imagined.</p>
<p>There is no temptation to dwell unnecessarily upon the short period
of horror and calamity with which this glorious life came to an end. If
<a name="Page_109"></a>Titian had died a year earlier, his biographer
might still have wound up
with those beautiful words of Vasari's peroration: "E stato Tiziano
sanissimo et fortunate quant' alcun altro suo pari sia stato ancor mai;
e
non ha mai avuto dai cieli se non favori e felicit&agrave;." Too true
it is, alas, that
no man's life may be counted happy until its close! Now comes upon the
great city this all-enveloping horror of the plague, beginning in 1575,
but in 1576 attaining to such vast proportions as to sweep away more
than a quarter of the whole population of 190,000 inhabitants. On the
17th of August, 1576, old Titian is attacked and swept away&#8212;surprised,
as one would like to believe, while still at work on his <i>Piet&agrave;</i>.
Even at
such a moment, when panic reigns supreme, and the most honoured, the
most dearly beloved are left untended, he is not to be hurried into an
unmarked grave. Notwithstanding the sanitary law which forbids the
burial of one who has succumbed to the plague in any of the city
churches, he receives the supreme and at this awful moment unique
honour of solemn obsequies. The body is taken with all due observance
to the great church of the Frari, and there interred in the Cappella
del
Crocifisso, which Titian has already, before the quarrel with the
Franciscans,
designated as his final resting-place. He is spared the grief of
knowing that the favourite son, Orazio, for whom all these years he has
laboured and schemed, is to follow him immediately, dying also of the
plague, and not even at Biri Grande, but in the Lazzaretto Vecchio,
near
the Lido; that the incorrigible Pomponio is to succeed and enjoy the
inheritance after his own unworthy fashion. He is spared the knowledge
of the great calamity of 1577, the destruction by fire of the Sala del
Gran Consiglio, and with it, of the <i>Battle of Cadore</i>, and most
of the noble
work done officially for the Doges and the Signoria. One would like to
think that this catastrophe of the end must have come suddenly upon the
venerable master like a hideous dream, appearing to him, as death often
does to those upon whom it descends, less significant than it does to
us
who read. Instead of remaining fixed in sad contemplation of this short
final moment when the radiant orb goes suddenly down below the
horizon in storm and cloud, let us keep steadily in view the light as,
serene in its far-reaching radiance, it illuminated the world for
eighty
splendid years. Let us think of Titian as the greatest painter, if not
the
greatest genius in art, that the world has produced; as, what Vasari
with
<a name="Page_110"></a>such conviction described him to be, "the man as
highly favoured by
fortune as any of his kind had ever been before him."<a

<p> It is especially to be noted that there is not a trace of red in
the picture, save for
the modest crimson waistband of the St. Catherine. Contrary to almost
universal usage,
it might almost be said to orthodoxy, the entire draperies of the
Virgin are of one intense
blue. Her veil-like head-gear is of a brownish gray, while the St.
Catherine wears a
golden-brown scarf, continuing the glories of her elaborately dressed
hair. The audacity
of the colour-scheme is only equalled by its success; no calculated
effort at anything
unusual being apparent. The beautiful naked <i>putto</i> who appears
in the sky, arresting
the progress of the shepherds, is too trivial in conception for the
occasion. A similar
incident is depicted in the background of the much earlier <i>Holy
Family</i>, No. 4. at the
National Gallery, but there the messenger angel is more appropriately
and more
reverently depicted as full-grown and in flowing garments.</p>

of life and
of a definite personal character makes it almost repellent,
notwithstanding the breadth and
easy mastery of the technique. Rubens's copy of a lost or unidentified
Titian, No. 845
in the same gallery, shows that he painted Isabella from life in mature
middle age, and
with a truthfulness omitting no sign of over-ripeness. This portrait
may very possibly
have been done in 1522, when Titian appeared at the court of the
Gonzagas. Its
realism, even allowing for Rubens's unconscious exaggeration, might
well have deterred
the Gonzaga princess from being limned from life some twelve years
later still.</p>

1116 (Cat. 1891), in the Alte Pinakothek of Munich. This is a piece too
cold and hard,
too opaque, to have come even from his studio. It is a <i>pasticcio</i>
made up in a curiously
mechanical way, from the Louvre <i>Allegory</i> and the quite late <i>Education

<p> In much the same position, since it hardly enjoys the celebrity to
which it is
entitled, is another masterpiece of portraiture from the brush of
Titian, which, as belonging
to his earlier middle time, should more properly have been mentioned in
the first
section of this monograph. This is the great <i>Portrait of a Man in
Black</i>, No. 1591 in
the Louvre. It shows a man of some forty years, of simple mien yet of
indefinably tragic
aspect; he wears moderately long hair, is clothed entirely in black,
and rests his right
hand on his hip, while passing the left through his belt. The
dimensions of the canvas
are more imposing than those of the <i>Jeune Homme au Gant</i>. No
example in the Louvre,
even though it competes with Madrid for the honour of possessing the
greatest Titians
in the world, is of finer quality than this picture. Near this&#8212;No. 1592
in the same great
gallery&#8212;hangs another <i>Portrait of a Man in Black</i> by Titian, and
belonging to his
middle time. The personage presented, though of high breeding, is
cynical and repellent
of aspect. The strong right hand rests quietly yet menacingly on a
poniard, this attitude
serving to give a peculiarly aggressive character to the whole
conception. In the present
state of this fine and striking picture the yellowness and want of
transparency of the flesh-tones,
both in the head and hands, gives rise to certain doubts as to the
correctness of the
ascription. Yet this peculiarity may well arise from injury; it would
at any rate be
hazardous to put forward any other name than that of Titian, to whom we
must be
content to leave the portrait.</p>

<p> Palma Vecchio, in his presentments of ripe Venetian beauty, was, we
have seen,
much more literal than Giorgione, more literal, too, less the
poet-painter, than the young
Titian. Yet in the great <i>Venus</i> of the Fitzwilliam Museum,
Cambridge&#8212;not, indeed,
in that of Dresden&#8212;his ideal is a higher one than Titian's in such
pieces as the <i>Venus of
Urbino</i> and the later <i>Venus</i>, its companion, in the Tribuna.
The two Bonifazi of
Verona followed Palma, giving, however, to the loveliness of their
women not, indeed, a
more exalted character, but a less pronounced sensuousness&#8212;an added
refinement but a
weaker personality. Paris Bordone took the note from Titian, but being
less a great
artist than a fine painter, descended a step lower in the scale. Paolo
Veronese unaffectedly
joys in the beauty of woman, in the sheen of fair flesh, without any
under-current
of deeper meaning. Tintoretto, though like his brother Venetians he
delights
in the rendering of the human form unveiled, is but little disquieted
by the fascinating
problem which now occupies us. He is by nature strangely spiritual,
though he is far
from indulging in any false idealisation, though he shrinks not at all
from the statement of
the truth as it presents itself to him. Let his famous pictures in the
Anticollegio of the
Doges' Palace, his <i>Muses</i> at Hampton Court, and above all that
unique painted poem, <i>The
Rescue</i>, in the Dresden Gallery, serve to support this view of his
art.</p>

the Mantua pieces purchased for Charles I. by Daniel Nys from Duke

<p> A gigantic canvas of this order is, or rather was, the famous <i>Storm</i>
of the Venetian
Accademia, which has for many years past been dubitatively assigned to
Giorgione.
Vasari described it as by Palma Vecchio, stating that it was painted
for the Scuola di S.
Marco in the Piazza SS. Giovanni e Paolo, in rivalry with Gian
Bellino(!) and Mansueti,
and referring to it in great detail and with a more fervent enthusiasm
than he accords to
any other Venetian picture. To the writer, judging from the parts of
the original which
have survived, it has long appeared that this may indeed be after all
the right attribution.
The ascription to Giorgione is mainly based on the romantic character
of the invention,
which certainly does not answer to anything that we know from the hand
or brain of
Palma. But then the learned men who helped Giorgione and Titian may
well have
helped him; and the structure of the thick-set figures in the
foreground is absolutely his,
as is also the sunset light on the horizon.</p>

inflexible regularity&#8212;strangely
heighten the solemn tragedy of the scene.</p>

<p> Vasari saw a <i>Christ with Cleophas and Luke</i> by Titian, above
the door in the Salotta
d'Oro, which precedes the Sala del Consiglio de' Dieci in the Doges'
Palace, and states
that it had been acquired by the patrician Alessandro Contarini and by
him presented to
the Signoria. The evidence of successive historians would appear to
prove that it
remained there until the close of last century. According to Crowe and
Cavalcaselle the
Louvre picture was a replica done for Mantua, which with the other
Gonzaga pictures
found its way into Charles I.'s collection, and thence, through that of
Jabach, finally
into the gallery of Louis XIV. At the sale of the royal collection by
the Commonwealth
it was appraised at &pound;600. The picture bears the signature,
unusual for this
period, "Tician." There is another <i>Christ with the Pilgrims at
Emmaus</i> in the collection
of the Earl of Yarborough, signed "Titianus," in which, alike as to the
figures, the
scheme of colour, and the landscape, there are important variations.
One point is of
especial importance. Behind the figure of St. Luke in the Yarborough
picture is a
second pillar. This is not intended to appear in the Louvre picture;
yet underneath
the glow of the landscape there is just the shadow of such a pillar,
giving evidence of a
<i>pentimento</i> on the part of the master. This, so far as it goes,
is evidence that the Louvre
example was a revised version, and the Yarborough picture a repetition
or adaptation of
the first original seen by Vasari. However this may be, there can be no
manner of doubt
that the picture in the Long Gallery of the Louvre is an original
entirely from the hand
of Titian, while Lord Yarborough's picture shows nothing of his touch
and little even
of the manner of his studio at the time.</p>

<p> A number of fine portraits must of necessity be passed over in
these remarks. The
superb if not very well-preserved <i>Antonio Portia</i>, within the
last few years added to the
Brera, dates back a good many years from this time. Then we have, among
other
things, the <i>Benedetto Varchi</i> and the <i>Fabrizio Salvaresio</i>
of the Imperial Museum at
Vienna&#8212;the latter bearing the date 1558. The writer is unable to accept
as a genuine
Titian the interesting but rather matter-of-fact <i>Portrait of a Lady
in Mourning</i>, No. 174 in
the Dresden Gallery. The master never painted with such a lack of charm
and distinction.
Very doubtful, but difficult to judge in its present state, is the <i>Portrait
of a Lady
with a Vase</i>, No. 173 in the same collection. Morelli accepts as a
genuine example of the
master the <i>Portrait of a Lady in a Red Dress</i> also in the
Dresden Gallery, where it bears
the number 176. If the picture is his, as the technical execution would
lead the observer
to believe, it constitutes in its stiffness and unambitious <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>
a curious exception in his
long series of portraits.</p>

<p> This picture is mentioned in the list of 1574 furnished by Titian
to Secretary Antonio
Perez. A <i>Perseus and Andromeda</i> by, or attributed to, Titian was
in the Orleans Gallery.
Is this the canvas now in the Wallace Collection, but not as yet
publicly exhibited
there? This last piece was undoubtedly produced in the <i>entourage</i>
and with the assistance
of Titian, and it corresponds perfectly to Vasari's description of the <i>Deliverance
of
Andromeda</i>. It has the loose easy touch of the late time, but
obscured as it at present is
by dirt and successive coats of now discoloured varnish, no more
definite opinion with
regard to its merits can be given. No. 135 in the Hermitage is a canvas
identical in
subject and dimensions with this last-named picture. It was once
attributed to Tintoretto,
but is now put down to the school of Titian.</p>

<p> Somewhat earlier in the order of the late works should come in, if
we may venture
to judge from the technique of a work that is practically a ruin, the <i>Adam
and Eve</i> of
the Prado, in which, for the usual serpent with the human head of the
feminine type,
Titian has substituted as tempter an insignificant <i>amorino</i>. Far
more enjoyable than this
original in its present state is the magnificent copy, with slight yet
marked variations,
left behind by Rubens. This is also to be found in the Prado. A drawing
by the
great Antwerper from Titian's picture is in the Louvre. This is more
markedly Flemish
in aspect than the painted canvas, and lacks the foolish little Love.</p>

<p> It was the intention of the writer to add to this monograph a short
chapter on the
drawings of Titian. The subject is, however, far too vast for such
summary treatment,
and its discussion must therefore be postponed. Leaving out of the
question the very
numerous drawings by Domenico Campagnola which Morelli has once for all
separated
from those of the greater master, and those also which, while belonging
to the same class
and period, are neither Titian's nor even Campagnola's, a few of the
genuine landscapes may
be just lightly touched upon. The beautiful early landscape with a
battlemented
castle, now or lately in the possession of Mr. T.W. Russell
(reproduction in the
British Museum marked 1879-5-10-224) is in the opinion of the writer a
genuine
Titian. <i>The Vision of St. Eustace</i>, reproduced in the first
section of this monograph
("The Earlier Work of Titian") from the original in the British Museum,
is
a noble and pathetic example of the earlier manner. Perhaps the most
beautiful
of the landscape drawings still preserving something of the
Giorgionesque aroma is
that with the enigmatic female figure, entirely nude but with the head
veiled, and the
shepherds sheltering from the noonday sun, which is in the great
collection at Chatsworth
(No. 318 in Venetian Exhibition at New Gallery). Later than this is the
fine landscape
in the same collection with a riderless horse crossing a stream (No.
867 in Venetian
Exhibition at New Gallery). The well-known <i>St. Jerome</i> here
given (British Museum) is
ascribed by no less an authority than Giovanni Morelli to the master,
but the poor quality
of the little round trees, and of the background generally, is
calculated to give pause to the
student. A good example of the later style, in which the technique is
more that of the
painter and less that of the draughtsman, is the so-called <i>Landscape
with the Pedlar</i> at
Chatsworth. But, faded though it is, the finest extant drawing of the
later period is
that here (p. 78) for the first time reproduced by the kind permission
of the owner,
Professor Legros, who had the great good fortune and good taste to
discover it in a
London book-shop. There can be no doubt that this ought to be in the
Print Room
at the British Museum. A good instance, on the other hand, of a drawing
which cannot
without demur be left to Titian, though it is a good deal too late in
style for
Domenico Campagnola, and moreover, much too fine and sincere for that
clever,
facile adapter of other people's work, is the beautiful pastoral in the
Albertina at
Vienna (B. 283), with the shepherd piping as he leads his flock
homewards.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://gutenberg.net/etext06/">http://gutenberg.net/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
