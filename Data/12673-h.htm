<h4>THE PROMENADE</h4>
<br />

<p>The piece was a West End success so brilliant
that even if you belonged to the intellectual
despisers of the British theatre you could not hold
up your head in the world unless you had seen it;
even for such as you it was undeniably a success
of curiosity at least.</p>

<p>The stage scene flamed extravagantly with
crude orange and viridian light, a rectangle of
bedazzling illumination; on the boards, in the
midst of great width, with great depth behind
them and arching height above, tiny squeaking
figures ogled the primeval passion in gesture and
innuendo. From the arc of the upper circle convergent
beams of light pierced through gloom and
broke violently on this group of the half-clad
lovely and the swathed grotesque. The group did
not quail. In fullest publicity it was licensed to
say that which in private could not be said where
men and women meet, and that which could not
be printed. It gave a voice to the silent appeal
of pictures and posters and illustrated weeklies all
over the town; it disturbed the silence of the most
secret groves in the vast, undiscovered hearts of
men and women young and old. The half-clad
lovely were protected from the satyrs in the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page8" id="page8">[8]</a></span>
audience by an impalpable screen made of light
and of ascending music in which strings, brass,
and concussion exemplified the na&iuml;ve sensuality of
lyrical niggers. The guffaw which, occasionally
leaping sharply out of the dim, mysterious auditorium,
surged round the silhouetted conductor
and drove like a cyclone between the barriers of
plush and gilt and fat cupids on to the stage&mdash;this
huge guffaw seemed to indicate what might
have happened if the magic protection of the
impalpable screen had not been there.</p>

<p>Behind the audience came the restless Promenade,
where was the reality which the stage
reflected. There it was, multitudinous, obtainable,
seizable, dumbly imploring to be carried off.
The stage, very daring, yet dared no more than
hint at the existence of the bright and joyous
reality. But there it was, under the same roof.</p>

<p>Christine entered with Madame Larivaudi&egrave;re.
Between shoulders and broad hats, as through a
telescope, she glimpsed in the far distance the
illusive, glowing oblong of the stage; then the
silhouetted conductor and the tops of instruments;
then the dark, curved concentric rows of spectators.
Lastly she took in the Promenade, in which
she stood. She surveyed the Promenade with a
professional eye. It instantly shocked her, not
as it might have shocked one ignorant of human
nature and history, but by reason of its frigidity,
its constraint, its solemnity, its pretence. In one
glance she embraced all the figures, moving or
stationary, against the hedge of shoulders in front
and against the mirrors behind&mdash;all of them: the
programme girls, the cigarette girls, the chocolate
<span class="newpage"><a name="page9" id="page9">[9]</a></span>
girls, the cloak-room girls, the waiters, the overseers,
as well as the vivid courtesans and their
client&egrave;le in black, tweed, or khaki. With scarcely
an exception they all had the same strange look,
the same absence of gesture. They were northern,
blond, self-contained, terribly impassive. Christine
impulsively exclaimed&mdash;and the faint cry was
dragged out of her, out of the bottom of her heart,
by what she saw:</p>

<p>&quot;My god! How mournful it is!&quot;</p>

<p>Lise Larivaudi&egrave;re, a stout and benevolent
Bruxelloise, agreed with uncomprehending indulgence.
The two chatted together for a few moments,
each ceremoniously addressing the other as
&quot;Madame,&quot; &quot;Madame,&quot; and then they parted,
insinuating themselves separately into the slow,
confused traffic of the Promenade.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page10" id="page10">[10]</a></span>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="Chapter_2"></a><h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<h4>THE POWER</h4>
<br />

<p>Christine knew Piccadilly, Leicester Square,
Regent Street, a bit of Oxford Street, the Green
Park, Hyde Park, Victoria Station, Charing
Cross. Beyond these, London, measureless as the
future and the past, surrounded her with the
unknown. But she had not been afraid, because
of her conviction that men were much the same
everywhere, and that she had power over them.
She did not exercise this power consciously; she
had merely to exist and it exercised itself. For
her this power was the mystical central fact of
the universe. Now, however, as she stood in the
Promenade, it seemed to her that something
uncanny had happened to the universe. Surely it
had shifted from its pivot! Her basic conviction
trembled. Men were not the same everywhere,
and her power over them was a delusion. Englishmen
were incomprehensible; they were not
human; they were apart. The memory of the
hundreds of Englishmen who had yielded to her
power in Paris (for she had specialised in travelling
Englishmen) could not re-establish her conviction
as to the sameness of men. The presence
of her professed rivals of various nationalities in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page11" id="page11">[11]</a></span>
the Promenade could not restore it either. The
Promenade in its cold, prim languor was the very
negation of desire. She was afraid. She foresaw
ruin for herself in this London, inclement, misty
and inscrutable.</p>

<p>And then she noticed a man looking at her,
and she was herself again and the universe was
itself again. She had a sensation of warmth and
heavenly reassurance, just as though she had drunk
an anisette or a cr&ecirc;me de menthe. Her features
took on an innocent expression; the characteristic
puckering of the brows denoted not discontent,
but a gentle concern for the whole world and also
virginal curiosity. The man passed her. She did
not stir. Presently he emerged afresh out of the
moving knots of promenaders and discreetly
approached her. She did not smile, but her eyes
lighted with a faint amiable benevolence&mdash;scarcely
perceptible, doubtful, deniable even, but enough.
The man stopped. She at once gave a frank, kind
smile, which changed all her face. He raised his
hat an inch or so. She liked men to raise their
hats. Clearly he was a gentleman of means,
though in morning dress. His cigar had a very
fine aroma. She classed him in half a second and
was happy. He spoke to her in French, with a
slight, unmistakable English accent, but very
good, easy, conversational French&mdash;French
French. She responded almost ecstatically:</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, you speak French!&quot;</p>

<p>She was too excited to play the usual comedy,
so flattering to most Englishmen, of pretending
that she thought from his speech that he was a
Frenchman. The French so well spoken from a
man's mouth in London most marvellously
<span class="newpage"><a name="page12" id="page12">[12]</a></span>
enheartened her and encouraged her in the
perilous enterprise of her career. She was candidly
grateful to him for speaking French.</p>

<p>He said after a moment:</p>

<p>&quot;You have not at all a fatigued air, but would
it not be preferable to sit down?&quot;</p>

<p>A man of the world! He could phrase his
politeness. Ah! There were none like an Englishman
of the world. Frenchmen, delightfully
courteous up to a point, were unsatisfactory past
that point. Frenchmen of the south were detestable,
and she hated them.</p>

<p>&quot;You have not been in London long?&quot; said
the man, leading her away to the lounge.</p>

<p>She observed then that, despite his national
phlegm, he was in a state of rather intense excitation.
Luck! Enormous luck! And also an augury
for the future! She was professing in London for
the first time in her life; she had not been in the
Promenade for five minutes; and lo! the ideal
admirer. For he was not young. What a fine
omen for her profound mysticism and superstitiousness!</p>

<a name="Chapter_3"></a><h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<h4>THE FLAT</h4>
<br />

<p>Her flat was in Cork Street. As soon as they
entered it the man remarked on its warmth and
its cosiness, so agreeable after the November
streets. Christine only smiled. It was a long,
narrow flat&mdash;a small sitting-room with a piano
and a sideboard, opening into a larger bedroom
shaped like a thick L. The short top of the L,
not cut off from the rest of the room, was installed
as a <i>cabinet de toilette</i>, but it had a divan. From
the divan, behind which was a heavily curtained
window, you could see right through the flat to
the curtained window of the sitting-room. All
the lights were softened by paper shades of a
peculiar hot tint between Indian red and carmine,
giving a rich, romantic effect to the gleaming pale
enamelled furniture, and to the voluptuous
engravings after Sir Frederick Leighton, and the
sweet, sentimental engravings after Marcus Stone,
and to the assorted knicknacks. The flat had
homogeneity, for everything in it, except the
stove, had been bought at one shop in Tottenham
Court Road by a landlord who knew his business.
The stove, which was large, stood in the bedroom
fireplace, and thence radiated celestial comfort
and security throughout the home; the stove was
the divinity of the home and Christine the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page14" id="page14">[14]</a></span>
priestess; she had herself bought the stove, and
she understood its personality&mdash;it was one of
your finite gods.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you take something?&quot; she asked, the
hostess.</p>

<p>Whisky and a siphon and glasses were on the
sideboard.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, thanks!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not even a cigarette?&quot; Holding out the
box and looking up at him, she appealed with a
long, anxious glance that he should honour her
cigarettes.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you!&quot; he said. &quot;I should like a
cigarette very much.&quot;</p>

<p>She lit a match for him.</p>

<p>&quot;But you&mdash;do you not smoke?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Try one of mine&mdash;for a change.&quot;</p>

<p>He produced a long, thin gold cigarette-case,
stuffed with cigarettes.</p>

<p>She lit a cigarette from his.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried after a few violent puffs.
&quot;I like enormously your cigarettes. Where are
they to be found?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look!&quot; said he. &quot;I will put these few in
your box.&quot; And he poured twenty cigarettes
into an empty compartment of the box, which
was divided into two.</p>

<p>&quot;Not all!&quot; she protested.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I say NO!&quot; she insisted with a gesture
suddenly firm, and put a single cigarette back
into his case and shut the case with a snap, and
herself returned it to his pocket. &quot;One ought
<span class="newpage"><a name="page15" id="page15">[15]</a></span>
never to be without a cigarette.&quot;</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>&quot;You understand life.... How nice it is here!&quot;
He looked about and then sighed.</p>

<p>&quot;But why do you sigh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sigh of content! I was just thinking this
place would be something else if an English girl
had it. It is curious, lamentable, that English
girls understand nothing&mdash;certainly not love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As for that, I've always heard so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They understand nothing. Not even warmth.
One is cold in their rooms.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As for that&mdash;I mean warmth&mdash;one may say
that I understand it; I do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You understand more than warmth. What is
your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Christine.&quot;</p>

<p>She was the accidental daughter of a daughter
of joy. The mother, as frequently happens in
these cases, dreamed of perfect respectability for
her child and kept Christine in the country far
away in Paris, meaning to provide a good dowry
in due course. At forty-two she had not got the
dowry together, nor even begun to get it together,
and she was ill. Feckless, dilatory and extravagant,
she saw as in a vision her own shortcomings
and how they might involve disaster for Christine.
Christine, she perceived, was a girl imperfectly
educated&mdash;for in the affair of Christine's education
the mother had not aimed high enough&mdash;indolent,
but economical, affectionate, and with a very great
deal of temperament. Actuated by deep maternal
solicitude, she brought her daughter back to
Paris, and had her inducted into the profession
<span class="newpage"><a name="page16" id="page16">[16]</a></span>
under the most decent auspices. At nineteen
Christine's second education was complete. Most
of it the mother had left to others, from a sense
of propriety. But she herself had instructed
Christine concerning the five great plagues of the
profession. And also she had adjured her never
to drink alcohol save professionally, never to
invest in anything save bonds of the City of Paris,
never to seek celebrity, which according to the
mother meant ultimate ruin, never to mix
intimately with other women. She had expounded
the great theory that generosity towards men in
small things is always repaid by generosity in
big things&mdash;and if it is not the loss is so slight!
And she taught her the fundamental differences
between nationalities. With a Russian you had
to eat, drink and listen. With a German you
had to flatter, and yet adroitly insert, &quot;Do not
imagine that I am here for the fun of the thing.&quot;
With an Italian you must begin with finance.
With a Frenchman you must discuss finance
before it is too late. With an Englishman you
must talk, for he will not, but in no circumstances
touch finance until he has mentioned it. In each
case there was a risk, but the risk should be faced.
The course of instruction finished, Christine's
mother had died with a clear conscience and a
mind consoled.</p>

<p>Said Christine, conversational, putting the
question that lips seemed then to articulate of
themselves in obedience to its imperious demand
for utterance:</p>

<p>&quot;How long do you think the war will last?&quot;</p>

<p>The man answered with serenity:
<span class="newpage"><a name="page17" id="page17">[17]</a></span>
&quot;The war has not begun yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How English you are! But all the same,
I ask myself whether you would say that if you
had seen Belgium. I came here from Ostend last
month.&quot; The man gazed at her with new
vivacious interest.</p>

<p>&quot;So it is like that that you are here!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But do not let us talk about it,&quot; she added
quickly with a mournful smile.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no!&quot; he agreed.... &quot;I see you have
a piano. I expect you are fond of music.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; she exclaimed in a fresh, relieved tone.
&quot;Am I fond of it! I adore it, quite simply. Do
play for me. Play a boston&mdash;a two-step.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;But you play. I am sure of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you?&quot; he parried.</p>

<p>She made a sad negative sign.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'll play something out of <i>The Rosenkavalier</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! But you are a <i>musician</i>!&quot; She amiably
scrutinised him. &quot;And yet&mdash;no.&quot;</p>

<p>Smiling, he, too, made a sad negative sign.</p>

<p>&quot;The waltz out of <i>The Rosenkavalier</i>, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes! A waltz. I prefer waltzes to
anything.&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as he had played a few bars she passed
demurely out of the sitting-room, through the
main part of the bedroom into the <i>cabinet de
toilette</i>. She moved about in the <i>cabinet de toilette</i>
thinking that the waltz out of <i>The Rosenkavalier</i>
was divinely exciting. The delicate sound of her
movements and the plash of water came to him
across the bedroom. As he played he threw a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page18" id="page18">[18]</a></span>
glance at her now and then; he could see well
enough, but not very well because the smoke of
the shortening cigarette was in his eyes.</p>

<p>She returned at length into the sitting-room,
carrying a small silk bag about five inches by
three. The waltz finished.</p>

<p>&quot;But you'll take cold!&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p>&quot;No. At home I never take cold. Besides&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Smiling at him as he swung round on the
music-stool, she undid the bag, and drew from it
some folded stuff which she slowly shook out,
rather in the manner of a conjurer, until it was
revealed as a full-sized kimono. She laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it not marvellous?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is what I wear. In the way of chiffons
it is the only fantasy I have bought up to the
present in London. Of course, clothes&mdash;I have
been forced to buy clothes. It matches exquisitely
the stockings, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>She slid her arms into the sleeves of the transparency.
She was a pretty and highly developed
girl of twenty-six, short, still lissom, but with
the fear of corpulence in her heart. She had
beautiful hair and beautiful eyes, and she had that
pucker of the forehead denoting, according to
circumstances, either some kindly, grave preoccupation
or a benevolent perplexity about
something or other.</p>

<p>She went near him and clasped hands round
his neck, and whispered:</p>

<p>&quot;Your waltz was adorable. You are an artist.&quot;</p>

<p>And with her shoulders she seemed to sketch
the movements of dancing.</p>

<h4>CONFIDENCE</h4>
<br />

<p>After putting on his thick overcoat and one
glove he had suddenly darted to the dressing-table
for his watch, which he was forgetting.
Christine's face showed sympathetic satisfaction
that he had remembered in time, simultaneously
implying that even if he had not remembered, the
watch would have been perfectly safe till he called
for it. The hour was five minutes to midnight.
He was just going. Christine had dropped a little
batch of black and red Treasury notes on to the
dressing-table with an indifferent if not perhaps
an impatient air, as though she held these financial
sequels to be a stain on the ideal, a tedious
necessary, a nuisance, or simply negligible.</p>

<p>She kissed him goodbye, and felt agreeably
fragile and soft within the embrace of his huge,
rough overcoat. And she breathed winningly,
delicately, apologetically into his ear:</p>

<p>&quot;Thou wilt give something to the servant?&quot;
Her soft eyes seemed to say, &quot;It is not for myself
that I am asking, is it?&quot;</p>

<p>He made an easy philanthropic gesture to
indicate that the servant would have no reason to
regret his passage.</p>

<p>He opened the door into the little hall, where
the fat Italian maid was yawning in an atmosphere
<span class="newpage"><a name="page20" id="page20">[20]</a></span>
comparatively cold, and then, in a change of
purpose, he shut the door again.</p>

<p>&quot;You do not know how I knew you could
not have been in London very long,&quot; he said
confidentially.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I saw you in Paris one night in July&mdash;at
the Marigny Theatre.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at the Marigny.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. The Marigny.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is true. I recall it. I wore white and a
yellow stole.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. You stood on the seat at the back of
the Promenade to see a contortionist girl better,
and then you jumped down. I thought you were
delicious&mdash;quite delicious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thou flatterest me. Thou sayest that to
flatter me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no. I assure you I went to the Marigny
every night for five nights afterwards in order to
find you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the Marigny is not my regular music-hall.
Olympia is my regular music-hall.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I went to Olympia and all the other halls,
too, each night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes! Then I must have left Paris. But
why, my poor friend, why didst thou not speak to
me at the Marigny? I was alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know. I hesitated. I suppose I was
afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thou!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So to-night I was terribly content to meet you.
When I saw that it was really you I could not
believe my eyes.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page21" id="page21">[21]</a></span>
<p>She understood now his agitation on first
accosting her in the Promenade. The affair very
pleasantly grew more serious for her. She liked
him. He had nice eyes. He was fairly tall and
broadly built, but not a bit stout. Neither dark
nor blond. Not handsome, and yet ... beneath
a certain superficial freedom, he was reserved.
He had beautiful manners. He was refined, and
he was refined in love; and yet he knew something.
She very highly esteemed refinement in a man.
She had never met a refined woman, and was
convinced that few such existed. Of course he
was rich. She could be quite sure, from his
way of handling money, that he was accustomed
to handling money. She would swear he was a
bachelor merely on the evidence of his eyes....
Yes, the affair had lovely possibilities. Afraid to
speak to her, and then ran round Paris after her
for five nights! Had he, then, had the lightning-stroke
from her? It appeared so. And why not?
She was not like other girls, and this she had
always known. She did precisely the same things
as other girls did. True. But somehow, subtly,
inexplicably, when she did them they were not
the same things. The proof: he, so refined and
distinguished himself, had felt the difference. She
became very tender.</p>

<p>&quot;To think,&quot; she murmured, &quot;that only on that
one night in all my life did I go to the Marigny!
And you saw me!&quot;</p>

<p>The coincidence frightened her&mdash;she might
have missed this nice, dependable, admiring
creature for ever. But the coincidence also
delighted her, strengthening her superstition. The
<span class="newpage"><a name="page22" id="page22">[22]</a></span>
hand of destiny was obviously in this affair. Was
it not astounding that on one night of all nights
he should have been at the Marigny? Was it
not still more astounding that on one night of
all nights he should have been in the Promenade
in Leicester Square?... The affair was ordained
since before the beginning of time. Therefore it
was serious.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my friend!&quot; she said. &quot;If only you had
spoken to me that night at the Marigny, you might
have saved me from troubles frightful&mdash;fantastic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p>He had confided in her&mdash;and at the right
moment. With her human lore she could not
have respected a man who had begun by admitting
to a strange and unproved woman that for
five days and nights he had gone mad about her.
To do so would have been folly on his part. But
having withheld his wild secret, he had charmingly
showed, by the gesture of opening and
then shutting the door, that at last it was too
strong for his control. Such candour deserved
candour in return. Despite his age, he looked
just then attractively, sympathetically boyish. He
was a benevolent creature. The responsive kindliness
of his enquiring &quot;How?&quot; was beyond
question genuine. Once more, in the warm and
dark-glowing comfort of her home, the contrast
between the masculine, thick rough overcoat and
the feminine, diaphanous, useless kimono appealed
to her soul. It seemed to justify, even to call for,
confidence from her to him.</p>

<p>The Italian woman behind the door coughed
impatiently and was not heard.</p>

<h4>OSTEND</h4>
<br />

<p>In July she had gone to Ostend with an
American. A gentleman, but mad. One of those
men with a fixed idea that everything would
always be all right and that nothing really and permanently
uncomfortable could possibly happen.
A very fair man, with red hair, and radiating
wrinkles all round his eyes&mdash;phenomenon due to
his humorous outlook on the world. He laughed
at her because she travelled with all her bonds
of the City of Paris on her person. He had met
her one night, and the next morning suggested
the Ostend excursion. Too sudden, too capricious,
of course; but she had always desired to see the
cosmopolitanism of Ostend. Trouville she did
not like, as you had sand with every meal if you
lived near the front. Hotel Astoria at Ostend.
Complete flat in the hotel. Very chic. The
red-haired one, the <i>rouquin</i>, had broad ideas,
very broad ideas, of what was due to a woman.
In fact, one might say that he carried generosity
in details to excess. But naturally with Americans
it was necessary to be surprised at nothing.
The <i>rouquin</i> said steadily that war would not
break out. He said so until the day on which it
broke out. He then became a Turk. Yes, a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page24" id="page24">[24]</a></span>
Turk. He assumed rights over her, the rights
of protection, but very strange rights. He would
not let her try to return to Paris. He said the
Germans might get to Paris, but to Ostend,
never&mdash;because of the English! Difficult to
believe, but he had locked her up in the complete
flat. The Ostend season had collapsed&mdash;pluff&mdash;like
that. The hotel staff vanished almost entirely.
One or two old fat Belgian women on the bedroom
floors&mdash;that seemed to be all. The <i>rouquin</i>
was exquisitely polite, but very firm. In fine,
he was a master. It was astonishing what he
did. They were the sole remaining guests in
the Astoria. And they remained because he
refused to permit the management to turn him
out. Weeks passed. Yes, weeks. English forces
came to Ostend. Marvellous. Among nations
there was none like the English. She did not
see them herself. She was ill. The <i>rouquin</i> had
told her that she was ill when she was not ill,
but lo! the next day she was ill&mdash;oh, a long
time. The <i>rouquin</i> told her the news&mdash;battle of
the Marne and all species of glorious deeds. An
old fat Belgian told her a different kind of
news. The stories of the fall of Li&eacute;ge, Namur,
Brussels, Antwerp. The massacres at Aerschot,
at Louvain. Terrible stories that travelled from
mouth to mouth among women. There was
always rape and blood and filth mingled. Stories
of a frightful fascination ... unrepeatable! Ah!</p>

<p>The <i>rouquin</i> had informed her one day that
the Belgian Government had come to Ostend.
Proof enough, according to him, that Ostend
could not be captured by the Germans! After
<span class="newpage"><a name="page25" id="page25">[25]</a></span>
that he had said nothing about the Belgian
Government for many days. And then one day
he had informed her casually that the Belgian
Government was about to leave Ostend by
steamer. But days earlier the old fat woman
had told her that the German staff had ordered
seventy-five rooms at the H&ocirc;tel des Postes at
Ghent. Seventy-five rooms. And that in the
space of a few hours Ghent had become a city
of the dead.... Thousands of refugees in Ostend.
Thousands of escaped virgins. Thousands of
wounded soldiers. Often, the sound of guns all
day and all night. And in the daytime occasionally,
a sharp sound, very loud; that meant that a
German aeroplane was over the town&mdash;killing ... Plenty
to kill. Ostend was always full, behind
the Digue, and yet people were always leaving&mdash;by
steamer. Steamers taken by assault. At first
there had been formalities, permits, passports.
But when one steamer had been taken by assault&mdash;no
more formalities! In trying to board the
steamers people were drowned. They fell into
the water and nobody troubled&mdash;so said the old
woman. Christine was better; desired to rise. The
<i>rouquin</i> said No, not yet. He would believe
naught. And now he believed one thing, and it
filled his mind&mdash;that German submarines sank
all refugee ships in the North Sea. Proof of the
folly of leaving Ostend. Yet immediately afterwards
he came and told her to get up. That is
to say, she had been up for several days, but
not outside. He told her to come away, come
away. She had only summer clothes, and it
was mid-October. What a climate, Ostend in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page26" id="page26">[26]</a></span>
October! The old woman said that thousands of
parcels of clothes for refugees had been sent by
generous England. She got a parcel; she had
means of getting it. She opened it with pride in
the bedroom of the flat. It contained eight corsets
and a ball-dress. A droll race, all the same, the
English. Had they no imagination? But, no
doubt, society women were the same everywhere.
It was notorious that in France....</p>

<p>Christine went forth in her summer clothes.
The <i>rouquin</i> had got an old horse-carriage. He
gave her much American money&mdash;or, rather,
cheques&mdash;which, true enough, she had since
cashed with no difficulty in London. They had to
leave the carriage. The station square was full of
guns and women and children and bundles. Yes,
together with a few men. She spent the whole
night in the station square with the <i>rouquin</i>, in her
summer clothes and his overcoat. At six o'clock
in the evening it was already dark. A night interminable.
Babies crying. One heard that at the
other end of the square a baby had been born.
She, Christine, sat next to a young mother with a
baby. Both mother and baby had the right arm
bandaged. They had both been shot through the
arm with the same bullet. It was near Aerschot.
The young woman also told her.... No, she
could not relate that to an Englishman. Happily
it did not rain. But the wind and the cold! In
the morning the <i>rouquin</i> put her on to a fishing-vessel.
She had nothing but her bonds of the City
of Paris and her American cheques. The crush
was frightful. The captain of the fishing-vessel,
however, comprehended what discipline was. He
<span class="newpage"><a name="page27" id="page27">[27]</a></span>
made much money. The <i>rouquin</i> would not come.
He said he was an American citizen and had all his
papers. For the rest, the captain would not let him
come, though doubtless the captain could have
been bribed. As they left the harbour, with other
trawlers, they could see the quays all covered with
the disappointed, waiting. Somebody in the
boat said that the Germans had that morning
reached&mdash;She forgot the name of the place,
but it was the next village to Ostend on the
Bruges road. Thus Christine parted from the
<i>rouquin</i>. Mad! Always wrong, even about the
German submarines. But <i>chic</i>. Truly <i>chic</i>.</p>

<p>What a voyage! What adventures with the
charitable people in England! People who
resembled nothing else on earth! People who did
not understand what life was.... No understanding
of that which it is&mdash;life! In fine ...!
However, she should stay in England. It was the
only country in which one could have confidence.
She was trying to sell the furniture of her flat in
Paris. Complications! Under the emergency law
she was not obliged to pay her rent to the landlord;
but if she removed her furniture then she would
have to pay the rent. What did it matter, though?
Besides, she might not be able to sell her furniture
after all. Remarkably few women in Paris at that
moment were in a financial state to buy furniture.
Ah no!</p>

<p>&quot;But I have not told you the tenth part!&quot;
said Christine.</p>

<p>&quot;Terrible! Terrible!&quot; murmured the man.</p>

<p>All the heavy sorrow of the world lay on her
puckered brow, and floated in her dark glistening
<span class="newpage"><a name="page28" id="page28">[28]</a></span>
eyes. Then she smiled, sadly but with courage.</p>

<p>&quot;I will come to see you again,&quot; said the man
comfortingly. &quot;Are you here in the afternoons?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Every afternoon, naturally.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I will come&mdash;not to-morrow&mdash;the day
after to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Already, long before, interrupting the buttoning
of his collar, she had whispered softly, persuasively,
clingingly, in the classic manner:</p>

<p>&quot;Thou art content, <i>ch&eacute;ri</i>? Thou wilt return?&quot;</p>

<p>And he had said: &quot;That goes without saying.&quot;</p>

<p>But not with quite the same conviction as he
now used in speaking definitely of the afternoon of
the day after to-morrow. The fact was, he was
moved; she too. She had been right not to tell
the story earlier, and equally right to tell it before
he departed. Some men, most men, hated to hear
any tale of real misfortune, at any moment, from
a woman, because, of course, it diverted their
thoughts.</p>

<p>In thus departing at once the man showed
characteristic tact. Her recital left nothing to be
said. They kissed again, rather like comrades.
Christine was still the vessel of the heavy sorrow
of the world, but in the kiss and in their glances
was an implication that the effective, triumphant
antidote to sorrow might be found in a mutual
trust. He opened the door. The Italian woman,
yawning and with her hand open, was tenaciously
waiting.</p>

<p>Alone, carefully refolding the kimono in its
original creases, Christine wondered what the
man's name was. She felt that the mysterious
future might soon disclose a germ of happiness.</p>

<h4>THE ALBANY</h4>
<br />

<p>G.J. Hoape&mdash;He was usually addressed as
&quot;G.J.&quot; by his friends, and always referred to
as &quot;G.J.&quot; by both friends and acquaintances&mdash;woke
up finally in the bedroom of his flat with
the thought:</p>

<p>&quot;To-day I shall see her.&quot;</p>

<p>He inhabited one of the three flats at the
extreme northern end of the Albany, Piccadilly,
W.I. The flat was strangely planned. Its shape
as a whole was that of a cube. Imagine the cube
to be divided perpendicularly into two very
unequal parts. The larger part, occupying nearly
two-thirds of the entire cubic space, was the
drawing-room, a noble chamber, large and lofty.
The smaller part was cut horizontally into two
storeys. The lower storey comprised a very small
hall, a fair bathroom, the tiniest staircase in
London, and G.J.'s very small bedroom. The
upper storey comprised a very small dining-room,
the kitchen, and servants' quarters.</p>

<p>The door between the bedroom and the drawing
room, left open in the night for ventilation,
had been softly closed as usual during G.J.'s
final sleep, and the bedroom was in absolute darkness
save for a faint grey gleam over the valance
<span class="newpage"><a name="page30" id="page30">[30]</a></span>
of the window curtains. G.J. could think. He
wondered whether he was in love. He hoped he
was in love, and the fact that the woman who
attracted him was a courtesan did not disturb
him in the least.</p>

<p>He was nearing fifty years of age. He had
casually known hundreds of courtesans in sundry
capitals, a few of them very agreeable; also a
number of women calling themselves, sometimes
correctly, actresses, all of whom, for various
reasons which need not be given, had proved very
unsatisfactory. But he had never loved&mdash;unless
it might be, mildly, Concepcion, and Concepcion
was now a war bride. He wanted to love. He
had never felt about any woman, not even about
Concepcion, as he felt about the woman seen for
a few minutes at the Marigny Theatre and then
for five successive nights vainly searched for in
all the chief music-halls of Paris. (A nice name,
Christine! It suited her.) He had given her up&mdash;never
expected to catch sight of her again; but
she had remained a steadfast memory, sad and
charming. The encounter in the Promenade in
Leicester Square was such a piece of heavenly
and incredible luck that it had, at the moment,
positively made him giddy. The first visit to
Christine's flat had beatified and stimulated him.
Would the second? Anyhow, she was the most
alluring woman&mdash;and yet apparently of dependable
character!&mdash;he had ever met. No other
consideration counted with him.</p>

<p>There was a soft knock; the door was pushed,
and wavy reflections of the drawing-room fire
played on the corner of the bedroom ceiling.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page31" id="page31">[31]</a></span>
Mrs. Braiding came in. G.J. had known it was
she by the caressing quality of the knock. Mrs.
Braiding was his cook and the wife of his &quot;man&quot;.
It was not her place to come in, but occasionally,
because something had happened to Braiding, she
did come in. She drew the curtains apart, and
the day of Vigo Street, pale, dirty, morose, feebly
and perfunctorily took possession of the bedroom.
Mrs. Braiding, having drawn the curtains,
returned to the door and from the doorway said:</p>

<p>&quot;Breakfast is practically ready, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. perceived that this was one of her brave,
resigned mornings. Since August she had borne
the entire weight of the war on her back, and
sometimes the burden would overpower her, but
never quite. G.J. switched on the light, arose
from his bed, assumed his dressing-gown, and,
gazing with accustomed pleasure round the bedroom,
saw that it was perfect.</p>

<p>He had furnished his flat in the Regency
style of the first decade of the nineteenth century,
as matured by George Smith, &quot;upholder extraordinary
to His Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales&quot;. The Pavilion at Brighton had given the
original idea to G.J., who saw in it the solution
of the problem of combining the somewhat
massive dignity suitable to a bachelor of middling
age with the bright, unconquerable colours which
the eternal twilight of London demands.</p>

<p>His dome bed was yellow as to its upper
works, with crimson valances above and yellow
valances below. The yellow-lined crimson curtains
(of course never closed) had green cords and
tassels, and the counterpane was yellow. This
<span class="newpage"><a name="page32" id="page32">[32]</a></span>
bed was a modest sample of the careful
and uncompromising reconstitution of a period
which he had everywhere carried out in his
abode.</p>

<p>The drawing-room, with its moulded ceiling
and huge recessed window, had presented an
admirable field for connoisseurship. Here the
clash of rich primary colours, the perpendiculars
which began with bronze girls' heads and ended
with bronze girls' feet or animals' claws, the vast
flat surfaces of furniture, the stiff curves of wood
and a drapery, the morbid rage for solidity
which would employ a candelabrum weighing five
hundredweight to hold a single wax candle, produced
a real and imposing effect of style; it was
a style debased, a style which was shedding the
last graces of French Empire in order soon to
appeal to a Victoria determined to be utterly
English and good; but it was a style. And G.J.
had scamped no detail. Even the pictures were
hung with thick tasselled cords of the Regency.
The drawing-room was a triumph.</p>

<p>Do not conceive that G.J. had lost his head
about furniture and that his notion of paradise
was an endless series of second-hand shops. He
had an admirable balance; and he held that a man
might make a faultless interior for himself and
yet not necessarily lose his balance. He resented
being called a specialist in furniture. He regarded
himself as an amateur of life, and, if a specialist
in anything, as a specialist in friendships. Yet he
was a solitary man (liking solitude without knowing
that he liked it), and in the midst of the
perfections which he had created he sometimes
<span class="newpage"><a name="page33" id="page33">[33]</a></span>
gloomily thought: &quot;What in the name of God
am I doing on this earth?&quot;</p>

<p>He went into the drawing-room, and there,
by the fire and in front of a formidable blue chair
whose arms developed into the grinning heads of
bronze lions, stood the lacquered table consecrated
to his breakfast tray; and his breakfast tray, with
newspaper and correspondence, had been magically
placed thereon as though by invisible hands.
And on one arm of the easy-chair lay the rug
which, because a dressing-gown does not button
all the way down, he put over his knees while
breakfasting in winter. Yes, he admitted with
pleasure that he was &quot;well served&quot;. Before eating
he opened the piano&mdash;a modern instrument concealed
in an ingeniously confected Regency case&mdash;and
played with taste a Bach prelude and fugue.</p>

<p>His was not the standardised and habituated
kind of musical culture which takes a Bach
prelude and fugue every morning before breakfast
with or without a glass of Lithia water or
fizzy saline. He did, however, customarily begin
the day at the piano, and on this particular
morning he happened to play a Bach prelude and
fugue.</p>

<p>And as he played he congratulated himself on
not having gone to seek Christine in the Promenade
on the previous night, as impatience had
tempted him to do. Such a procedure would
have been an error in worldliness and bad from
every point of view. He had wisely rejected the
temptation.</p>

<p>In the deep blue arm-chair, with the rug over
his knees and one hand on a lion's head, he
<span class="newpage"><a name="page34" id="page34">[34]</a></span>
glanced first at the opened <i>Times</i>, because of the
war. Among the few letters was one with the heading
of the Reveille Motor Horn Company Ltd.</p>

<p>G.J. like his father, had been a solicitor.
When he was twenty-five his father, a widower,
had died and left him a respectable fortune and a
very good practice. He sold half the practice to
an incoming partner, and four years later he sold
the other half of the practice to the same man.
At thirty he was free, and this result had been
attained through his frank negative answer to the
question, &quot;The law bores me&mdash;is there any reason
why I should let it continue to bore me?&quot; There
was no reason. Instead of the law he took up
life. Of business preoccupations naught remained
but his investments. He possessed a gift for
investing money. He had helped the man who had
first put the Reveille Motor Horn on the market.
He had had a mighty holding of shares in the
Reveille Syndicate Limited, which had so successfully
promoted the Reveille Motor Horn
Company Limited. And in the latter, too, he held
many shares. The Reveille Motor Horn Company
had prospered and had gone into the manufacture
of speedometers, illuminating outfits, and all
manner of motor-car accessories.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of war G.J. had given himself
up for lost. &quot;This is the end,&quot; he had said,
as a member of the sore-shaken investing public.
He had felt sick under the region of the heart.
In particular he had feared for his Reveille shares.
No one would want to buy expensive motor horns
in the midst of the greatest war that the world,
etc., etc.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page35" id="page35">[35]</a></span>
<p>Still the Reveille Company, after sustaining
the shock, had somehow continued to do a pretty
good business. It had patriotically offered its
plant and services to the War Office, and had been
repulsed with contumely and ignominy. The War
Office had most caustically intimated to the
Reveille Company that it had no use and never
under any conceivable circumstances could have
any use whatever for the Reveille Company,
and that the Reveille Company was a forward
and tedious jackanapes, unworthy even of an
articulate rebuff. Now the autograph letter
with the Reveille note-heading was written by
the managing director (who represented G.J.'s
interests on the Board), and it stated that the
War Office had been to the Reveille Company,
and implored it to enlarge itself, and given it
vast orders at grand prices for all sorts of things
that it had never made before. The profits of
1915 would be doubled, if not trebled&mdash;perhaps
quadrupled. G.J. was relieved, uplifted; and
he sniggered at his terrible forebodings of August
and September. Ruin? He was actually going
to make money out of the greatest war that the
world, etc. etc. And why not? Somebody had
to make money, and somebody had to pay for the
war in income tax. For the first time the incubus
of the war seemed lighter upon G.J. And also
he need feel no slightest concern about the financial
aspect of any possible developments of the
Christine adventure. He had a very clear and
undeniable sensation of positive happiness.</p>

<h4>FOR THE EMPIRE</h4>
<br />

<p>Mrs. Braiding came into the drawing-room,
and he wondered, paternally, why she was so
fidgety and why her tranquillising mate had not
appeared. To the careless observer she was a
cheerful woman, but the temple of her brightness
was reared over a dark and frightful crypt in which
the demons of doubt, anxiety, and despair year
after year dragged at their chains, intimidating
hope. Slender, small, and neat, she passed her life
in bravely fronting the shapes of disaster with an
earnest, vivacious, upturned face. She was thirty-five,
and her aspect recalled the pretty, respected
lady's-maid which she had been before Braiding
got her and knocked some nonsense out of her
and turned her into a wife.</p>

<p>G.J., still paternally, but firmly, took her up
at once.</p>

<p>&quot;I say, Mrs. Braiding, what about this dish-cover?&quot;</p>

<p>He lifted the article, of which the copper was
beginning to show through the Sheffield plating.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes sir. It does look rather impoverished,
doesn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I told Braiding to use the new toast-dish
I bought last week but one.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page37" id="page37">[37]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Did you, sir? I was very happy about the
new one as soon as I saw it, but Braiding never
gave me your instructions in regard to it.&quot; She
glanced at the cabinet in which the new toast-dish
reposed with other antique metal-work. &quot;Braiding's
been rather upset this last few days, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This recruiting, sir. Of course, you are aware
he's decided on it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not aware of anything of the sort,&quot; said
G.J. rather roughly, perhaps to hide his sudden
emotion, perhaps to express his irritation at Mrs.
Braiding's strange habit of pretending that the
most startling pieces of news were matters of
common knowledge.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sir, of course you were out most of
yesterday, and you dined at the club. Braiding
attended at a recruiting office yesterday, sir. He
stood three hours in the crowd outside because
there was no room inside, and then he stood over
two hours in a passage inside before his turn came,
and nothing to eat all day, or drink either. And
when his turn came and they asked him his age,
he said 'thirty-six,' and the person was very angry
and said he hadn't any time to waste, and Braiding
had better go outside again and consider whether
he hadn't made a mistake about his age. So
Braiding went outside and considered that his age
was only thirty-three after all, but he couldn't
get in again, not by any means, so he just came
back here and I gave him a good tea, and he
needed it, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he saw me last night, and he never said
anything!&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page38" id="page38">[38]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Mrs. Braiding admitted with pain.
&quot;I asked him if he had told you, and he said he
hadn't and that I must.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is he now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He went off early, sir, so as to get a good
place. I shouldn't be a bit surprised if he's in
the army by this time. I know it's not the right
way of going about things, and Braiding's only
excuse is it's for the Empire. When it's a question
of the Empire, sir....&quot; At that instant the white
man's burden was Mrs. Braiding's, and the glance
of her serious face showed what the crushing
strain of it was.</p>

<p>&quot;I think he might have told me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sir. I'm very sorry. Very sorry.... But
you know what Braiding is.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. felt that that was just what he did not
know, or at any rate had not hitherto known.
He was hurt by Braiding's conduct. He had
always treated Braiding as a friend. They had
daily discussed the progress of the war. On the
previous night Braiding, in all the customary
sedateness of black coat and faintly striped trousers,
had behaved just as usual! It was astounding.
G.J. began to incline towards the views of certain
of his friends about the utter incomprehensibility
of the servile classes&mdash;views which he had often
annoyed them by traversing. Yes; it was astounding.
All this martial imperialism seething in the
depths of Braiding, and G.J. never suspecting
the ferment! Exceedingly difficult to conceive
Braiding as a soldier! He was the Albany valet,
and Albany valets were Albany valets and naught
else.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page39" id="page39">[39]</a></span>
<p>Mrs. Braiding continued:</p>

<p>&quot;It's very inconsiderate to you, sir. That's a
point that is appreciated by both Braiding and I.
But let us fervently hope it won't be for long,
sir. The consensus of opinion seems to be we
shall be in Berlin in the spring. And in the
meantime, I think&quot;&mdash;she smiled an appeal&mdash;&quot;I
can manage for you by myself, if you'll be so
good as to let me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! It's not that,&quot; said G.J. carelessly.
&quot;I expect you can manage all right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried she. &quot;I know how you feel about
it, sir, and I'm very sorry. And at best it's bound
to be highly inconvenient for a gentleman like
yourself, sir. I said to Braiding, 'You're taking
advantage of Mr. Hoape's good nature,' that's
what I said to Braiding, and he couldn't deny it.
However, sir, if you'll be so good as to let me try
what I can do by myself&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I tell you that'll be all right,&quot; he stopped her.</p>

<p>Braiding, his mainstay, was irrevocably gone.
He realised that, and it was a severe blow. He
must accept it. As for Mrs. Braiding managing,
she would manage in a kind of way, but the risks
to Regency furniture and china would be grave.
She did not understand Regency furniture and
china as Braiding did; no woman could. Braiding
had been as much a &quot;find&quot; as the dome bed or
the unique bookcase which bore the names of
&quot;Homer&quot; and &quot;Virgil&quot; in bronze characters on
its outer wings. Also, G.J. had a hundred little
ways about neckties and about trouser-stretching
which he, G.J., would have to teach Mrs. Braiding.
Still the war ...</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page40" id="page40">[40]</a></span>
<p>When she was gone he stood up and brushed
the crumbs from his dressing-gown, and
emitted a short, harsh laugh. He was laughing
at himself. Regency furniture and china! Neckties!
Trouser-stretching! In the next room was a youngish
woman whose minstrel boy to the war had gone&mdash;gone,
though he might be only in the next
street! And had she said a word about her feelings
as a wife? Not a word! But dozens of
words about the inconvenience to the god-like
employer! She had apologised to him because
Braiding had departed to save the Empire without
first asking his permission. It was not merely
astounding&mdash;it flabbergasted. He had always felt
that there was something fundamentally wrong in
the social fabric, and he had long had a preoccupation
to the effect that it was his business, his, to
take a share in finding out what was wrong and in
discovering and applying a cure. This preoccupation
had worried him, scarcely perceptibly,
like the delicate oncoming of neuralgia. There
must be something wrong when a member of one
class would behave to a member of another class
as Mrs. Braiding behaved to him&mdash;without protest
from him.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Braiding!&quot; he called out.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; She almost ran back into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>&quot;When shall you be seeing your husband?&quot;
At least he would remind her that she had a
husband.</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't an idea, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, when you do, tell him that I want to
speak to him; and you can tell him I shall pay
<span class="newpage"><a name="page41" id="page41">[41]</a></span>
you half his wages in addition to your own.&quot;</p>

<p>Her gratitude filled him with secret fury.</p>

<p>He said to himself:</p>

<p>&quot;Futile&mdash;these grand gestures about wages.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page42" id="page42">[42]</a></span>

<a name="Chapter_8"></a><h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<h4>BOOTS</h4>
<br />

<p>In the very small hall G.J. gazed at himself
in the mirror that was nearly as large as the
bathroom door, to which it was attached, and
which it ingeniously masked.</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Braiding was present, holding
his ebony stick, he carefully examined his
face and appearance without the slightest
self-consciousness. Nor did Mrs. Braiding's demeanour
indicate that in her opinion G.J. was behaving in
a manner eccentric or incorrect. He was dressed
in mourning. Honestly he did not believe that
he looked anywhere near fifty. His face was worn
by the friction of the world, especially under the
eyes, but his eyes were youthful, and his hair and
moustache and short, fine beard scarcely tinged
with grey. His features showed benevolence, with
a certain firmness, and they had the refinement
which comes of half a century's instinctive avoidance
of excess. Still, he was beginning to feel his
age. He moved more slowly; he sat down, instead
of standing up, at the dressing-table. And he
was beginning also to take a pride in mentioning
these changes and in the fact that he would be
fifty on his next birthday. And when talking to
men under thirty, or even under forty, he would
<span class="newpage"><a name="page43" id="page43">[43]</a></span>
say in a tone mingling condescension and envy:
&quot;But, of course, you're young.&quot;</p>

<p>He departed, remarking that he should not be
in for lunch and might not be in for dinner, and
he walked down the covered way to the Albany
Courtyard, and was approved by the Albany
porters as a resident handsomely conforming to
the traditional high standard set by the Albany
for its residents. He crossed Piccadilly, and as
he did so he saw a couple of jolly fine girls, handsome,
stylish, independent of carriage, swinging
freely along and intimately talking with that mien
of experience and broad-mindedness which some
girls manage to wear in the streets. One of them
in particular appealed to him. He thought how
different they were from Christine. He had
dreamt of just such girls as they were, and yet
now Christine filled the whole of his mind.</p>

<p>&quot;You can't foresee,&quot; he thought.</p>

<p>He dipped down into the extraordinary
rectangle of St. James's, where he was utterly at
home. A strange architecture, parsimoniously
plain on the outside, indeed carrying the Oriental
scorn for merely external effect to a point only
reachable by a race at once hypocritical and madly
proud. The shabby plainness of Wren's church
well typified all the parochial parsimony. The
despairing architect had been so pinched by his
employers in the matter of ornament that on the
whole of the northern facade there was only one
of his favourite cherub's heads! What a parish!</p>

<p>It was a parish of flat brick walls and brass
<span class="newpage"><a name="page44" id="page44">[44]</a></span>
door-knobs and brass plates. And the first commandment
was to polish every brass door-knob
and every brass plate every morning. What
happened in the way of disfigurement by polishing
paste to the surrounding brick or wood had no
importance. The conventions of the parish had
no eye save for brass door-knobs and brass plates,
which were maintained daily in effulgence by a
vast early-rising population. Recruiting offices,
casualty lists, the rumour of peril and of glory,
could do nothing to diminish the high urgency
of the polishing of those brass door-knobs and
those brass plates.</p>

<p>The shops and offices seemed to show that the
wants of customers were few and simple. Grouse
moors, fisheries, yachts, valuations, hosiery, neckties,
motor-cars, insurance, assurance, antique
china, antique pictures, boots, riding-whips, and,
above all, Eastern cigarettes! The master-passion
was evidently Eastern cigarettes. The few provision
shops were marmoreal and majestic, catering
as they did chiefly for the multifarious palatial
male clubs which dominated the parish and protected
and justified the innumerable &quot;bachelor&quot;
suites that hung forth signs in every street. The
parish, in effect, was first an immense monastery,
where the monks, determined to do themselves
extremely well in dignified peace, had made a prodigious
and not entirely unsuccessful effort to keep
out the excitable sex. And, second, it was an
excusable conspiracy on the part of intensely
respectable tradesmen and stewards to force the
non-bargaining sex to pay the highest possible
price for the privilege of doing the correct thing.</p>

<p>G.J. passed through the cardiac region of
St. James's, the Square itself, where knights,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page45" id="page45">[45]</a></span>
baronets, barons, brewers, viscounts, marquesses,
hereditary marshals and chief butlers, dukes,
bishops, banks, librarians and Government departments
gaze throughout the four seasons at the
statue of a Dutchman; and then he found himself
at his bootmaker's.</p>

<p>Now, his bootmaker was one of the three first
bootmakers in the West End, bearing a name
famous from Peru to Hong Kong. An untidy
interior, full of old boots and the hides of various
animals! A dirty girl was writing in a dirty tome,
and a young man was knotting together two pieces
of string in order to tie up a parcel. Such was
the &quot;note&quot; of the &quot;house&quot;. The girl smiled,
the young man bowed. In an instant the manager
appeared, and G.J. was invested with the attributes
of God. He informed the manager with
pain, and the manager heard with deep pain, that
the left boot of the new pair he then wore was
not quite comfortable in the toes. The manager
simply could not understand it, just as he simply
could not have understood a failure in the working
of the law of gravity. And if God had not told
him he would not have believed it. He knelt and
felt. He would send for the boots. He would
make the boots comfortable or he would make a
new pair. Expense was nothing. Trouble was
nothing. Incidentally he remarked with a sigh
that the enormous demand for military boots was
rendering it more and more difficult for him to
give to old patrons that prompt and plenary
attention which he would desire to give. However,
God in any case should not suffer. He
noticed that the boots were not quite well polished,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page46" id="page46">[46]</a></span>
and he ventured to charge God with hints for
God's personal attendant. Then he went swiftly
across to a speaking-tube and snapped:</p>

<p>&quot;Polisher!&quot;</p>

<p>A trap-door opened in the floor of the shop
and a horrible, pallid, weak, cringing man came
up out of the earth of St. James's, and knelt before
God far more submissively than even the manager
had knelt. He had brushes and blacking, and he
blacked and he brushed and breathed alternately,
undoing continually with his breath or his filthy
hand what he had done with his brush. He never
looked up, never spoke. When he had made the
boots like mirrors he gathered together his implements
and vanished, silent and dutifully bent,
through the trap-door back into the earth of St.
James's. And because the trap-door had not shut
properly the manager stamped on it and stamped
down the pale man definitely into the darkness
underneath. And then G.J. was wafted out of
the shop with smiles and bows.</p>

<a name="Chapter_9"></a><h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<h4>THE CLUB</h4>
<br />

<p>The vast &quot;morning-room&quot; of the Monumental
Club (pre-eminent among clubs for its architecture)
was on the whole tonically chilly. But as one
of the high windows stood open, and there were
two fires fluttering beneath the lovely marble
mantelpieces, between the fires and the window
every gradation of temperature could be experienced
by the curious. On each wall book-shelves
rose to the carved and gilded ceiling. The
furlongs of shelves were fitted with majestic
volumes containing all the Statutes, all the
Parliamentary Debates, and all the Reports of
Royal Commissions ever printed to narcotise the
conscience of a nation. These calf-bound works
were not, in fact, read; but the magnificent
pretence of their usefulness was completed by
carpeted mahogany ladders which leaned here and
there against the shelfing, in accord with the
theory that some studious member some day
might yearn and aspire to some upper shelf. On
reading-stands and on huge mahogany tables were
disposed the countless newspapers of Great Britain
and Ireland, Europe and America, and also the
files of such newspapers. The apparatus of
information was complete.</p>

<p>G.J. entered the splendid apartment like a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page48" id="page48">[48]</a></span>
discoverer. It was empty. Not a member; not
a servant! It waited, content to be inhabited,
equally content with its own solitude. This apartment
had made an adjunct even of the war; the
function of the war in this apartment was to
render it more impressive, to increase, if possible,
its importance, for nowhere else could the war be
studied so minutely day by day.</p>

<p>A strange thing! G.J.'s sense of duty to
himself had been quickened by the defection of
his valet. He felt that he had been failing to comprehend
in detail the cause and the evolution of
the war, and that even his general ideas as to it
were inexcusably vague; and he had determined
to go every morning to the club, at whatever
inconvenience, for the especial purpose of studying
and getting the true hang of the supreme topic.
As he sat down he was aware of the solemnity of
the great room, last fastness of the old strict
decorum in the club. You might not smoke in it
until after 10 p.m.</p>

<p>Two other members came in immediately, one
after the other. The first, a little, very old and
very natty man, began to read <i>The Times</i> at a
stand. The second, old too, but of larger and
firmer build, with a long, clean-shaven upper lip,
such as is only developed at the Bar, on the Bench,
and in provincial circles of Noncomformity, took
an easy-chair and another copy of <i>The Times</i>. A
few moments elapsed, and then the little old man
glanced round, and, assuming surprise that he had
not noticed G.J. earlier, nodded to him with a
very bright and benevolent smile.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page49" id="page49">[49]</a></span>
<p>G.J. said:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Sir Francis, what's your opinion of
this Ypres business. Seems pretty complicated,
doesn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>Sir Francis answered in a tone whose mild and
bland benevolence matched his smile:</p>

<p>&quot;I dare say the complications escape me. I
see the affair quite simply. We are holding on,
but we cannot continue to hold on. The Germans
have more men, far more guns, and infinitely
more ammunition. They certainly have not less
genius for war. What can be the result? I am
told by respectable people that the Germans lost
the war at the Marne. I don't appreciate it. I
am told that the Germans don't realise the Marne.
I think they realise the Marne at least as well as
we realise Tannenberg.&quot;</p>

<p>The slightly trembling, slightly mincing voice
of Sir Francis denoted such detachment, such
politeness, such kindliness, that the opinion it
emitted seemed to impose itself on G.J. with
extraordinary authority. There was a brief pause,
and Sir Francis ejaculated:</p>

<p>&quot;What's your view, Bob?&quot;</p>

<p>The other old man now consisted of a newspaper,
two seamy hands and a pair of grey legs.
His grim voice came from behind the newspaper,
which did not move:</p>

<p>&quot;We've no adequate means of judging.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True,&quot; said Sir Francis. &quot;Now, another
thing I'm told is that the War Office was perfectly
ready for the war on the scale agreed upon for
ourselves with France and Russia. I don't appreciate
that either. No War Office can be said to
be perfectly ready for any war until it has organised
<span class="newpage"><a name="page50" id="page50">[50]</a></span>
its relations with the public which it serves. My
belief is that the War Office had never thought
for one moment about the military importance of
public opinion and the Press. At any rate, it has
most carefully left nothing undone to alienate both
the public and the Press. My son-in-law has the
misfortune to own seven newspapers, and the tales
he tells about the antics of the Press Bureau&mdash;&quot;
Sir Francis smiled the rest of the sentence. &quot;Let
me see, they offered the Press Bureau to you,
didn't they, Bob?&quot;</p>

<p><i>The Times</i> fell, disclosing Bob, whose long
upper lip grew longer.</p>

<p>&quot;They did,&quot; he said. &quot;I made a few inquiries,
and found it was nothing but a shuttlecock of the
departments. I should have had no real power,
but unlimited quantities of responsibility. So I
respectfully refused.&quot;</p>

<p>Sir Francis remarked:</p>

<p>&quot;Your hearing's much better, Bob.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is,&quot; answered Bob. &quot;The fact is, I got
hold of a marvellous feller at Birmingham.&quot; He
laughed sardonically. &quot;I hope to go down to
history as the first judge that ever voluntarily
retired because of deafness. And now, thanks to
this feller at Birmingham, I can hear better than
seventy-five per cent of the Bench. The Lord
Chancellor gave me a hint I might care to return,
and so save a pension to the nation. I told him
I'd begin to think about that when he'd persuaded
the Board of Works to ventilate my old Court.&quot;
He laughed again. &quot;And now I see the Press
Bureau is enunciating the principle that it won't
permit criticism that might in any way weaken the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page51" id="page51">[51]</a></span>
confidence of the people in the administration of
affairs.&quot;</p>

<p>Bob opened his mouth wide and kept it open.</p>

<p>Sir Francis, with no diminution of the mild
and bland benevolence of his detachment, said:</p>

<p>&quot;The voice is the Press Bureau's voice, but
the hands are the hands of the War Office. Can
we reasonably hope to win, or not to lose, with
such a mentality at the head? I cannot admit
that the War Office has changed in the slightest
degree in a hundred years. From time to time a
brainy civilian walks in, like Cardwell or Haldane,
and saves it from becoming patently ridiculous.
But it never really alters. When I was War
Secretary in a transient government it was precisely
the same as it had been in the reign of
the Duke of Cambridge, and to-day it is still
precisely the same. I am told that Haldane
succeeded in teaching our generals the value of
Staff work as distinguished from dashing cavalry
charges. I don't appreciate that. The Staffs are
still wide open to men with social influence and
still closed to men without social influence. My
grandson is full of great modern notions about
tactics. He may have talent for all I know. He got
a Staff appointment&mdash;because he came to me and
I spoke ten words to an old friend of mine with
oak leaves in the club next door but one. No
questions asked. I mean no serious questions. It
was done to oblige me&mdash;the very existence of the
Empire being at stake, according to all accounts.
So that I venture to doubt whether we're going
to hold Ypres, or anything else.&quot;</p>

<p>Bob, unimpressed by the speech, burst out:</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page52" id="page52">[52]</a></span>
<p>&quot;You've got the perspective wrong. Obviously
the centre of gravity is no longer in the West&mdash;it's
in the East. In the West, roughly, equilibrium
has been established. Hence Poland is the decisive
field, and the measure of the Russian success or failure
is the measure of the Allied success or failure.&quot;</p>

<p>Sir Francis inquired with gentle joy:</p>

<p>&quot;Then we're all right? The Russians have
admittedly recovered from Tannenberg. If there
is any truth in a map they are doing excellently.
They're more brilliant than Potsdam, and they
can put two men into the field to the Germans'
one&mdash;two and a half in fact.&quot;</p>

<p>Bob fiercely rumbled:</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think we're all right. This habit of
thinking in men is dangerous. What are men
without munitions? And without a clean administration?
Nothing but a rabble. It is notorious
that the Russians are running short of munitions
and that the administration from top to bottom
consists of outrageous rascals. Moreover I see
to-day a report that the Germans have won a big
victory at Kutno. I've been expecting that.
That's the beginning&mdash;mark me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Sir Francis cheerfully agreed. &quot;Yes.
We're spending one million a day, and now income
tax is doubled! The country cannot stand it
indefinitely, and since our only hope lies in our
being able to stand it indefinitely, there is no
hope&mdash;at any rate for unbiased minds. Facts
are facts, I fear.&quot;</p>

<p>Bob cried impatiently:</p>

<p>&quot;Unbiased be damned! I don't want to be
unbiased. I won't be. I had enough of being
<span class="newpage"><a name="page53" id="page53">[53]</a></span>
unbiased when I was on the Bench, and I don't
care what any of you unbiased people say&mdash;I
believe we shall win.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. suddenly saw a boy in the old man, and
suddenly he too became boyish, remembering
what he had said to Christine about the war not
having begun yet; and with fervour he concurred:</p>

<p>&quot;So do I.&quot;</p>

<p>He rose, moved&mdash;relieved after a tension which
he had not noticed until it was broken. It was
time for him to go. The two old men were
recalled to the fact of his presence. Bob raised
the newspaper again.</p>

<p>Sir Francis asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to the&mdash;er&mdash;affair in the City?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said G.J. with careful unconcern.</p>

<p>&quot;I had thought of going. My granddaughter
worried me till I consented to take her. I got two
tickets; but no sooner had I arrayed myself this
morning than she rang me up to say that her baby
was teething and she couldn't leave it. In view
of this important creature's indisposition I sent the
tickets back to the Dean and changed my clothes.
Great-grandfathers have to be philosophers. I
say, Hoape, they tell me you play uncommonly
good auction bridge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I play,&quot; said G.J. modestly. &quot;But no better
than I ought.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You might care to make a fourth this afternoon,
in the card-room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should have been delighted to, but I've got
one of these war-committees at six o'clock.&quot;
Again he spoke with careful unconcern, masking
a considerable self-satisfaction.</p>

<h4>THE MISSION</h4>
<br />

<p>The great dim place was full, but crowding
had not been permitted. With a few exceptions in
the outlying parts, everybody had a seat. G.J.
was favourably placed for seeing the whole length
of the interior. Accustomed to the restaurants
of fashionable hotels, auction-rooms, theatrical
first-nights, the haunts of sport, clubs, and courts
of justice, he soon perceived, from the numerous
samples which he himself was able to identify, that
all the London worlds were fully represented in
the multitude&mdash;the official world, the political, the
clerical, the legal, the municipal, the military, the
artistic, the literary, the dilettante, the financial,
the sporting, and the world whose sole object in
life apparently is to be observed and recorded at
all gatherings to which admittance is gained by
privilege and influence alone.</p>

<p>There were in particular women the names and countenances
and family history of whom were familiar to hundreds of
thousands of illustrated-newspaper readers, even in
the most distant counties, and who never missed what
was called a &quot;function,&quot; whether &quot;brilliant,&quot; &quot;exclusive,&quot;
or merely scandalous. At murder trials, at the sales
of art collections, at the birth of musical comedies,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page55" id="page55">[55]</a></span>
at boxing matches, at historic debates, at receptions
in honour of the renowned, at luscious
divorce cases, they were surely present, and the
entire Press surely noted that they were present.
And if executions had been public, they would in
the same religious spirit have attended executions,
rousing their maids at milkmen's hours in order
that they might assume the right cunning frock
to fit the occasion. And they were here. And no
one could divine why or how, or to what eternal
end.</p>

<p>G.J. hated them, and he hated the solemn
self-satisfaction that brooded over the haughty
faces of the throng. He hated himself for having
accepted a ticket from the friend in the War
Office who was now sitting next to him. And yet
he was pleased, too. A disturbed conscience could
not defeat the instinct which bound him to the
whole fashionable and powerful assemblage. For
ever afterwards, to his dying hour, he could say&mdash;casually,
modestly, as a matter of course, but he
could still say&mdash;that he had been there. The Lord
Mayor and Sheriffs, tradesmen glittering like
Oriental potentates, passed slowly across his field
of vision. He thought with contempt of the City,
living ghoulish on the buried past, and obstinately
and humanly refusing to make a pile of its
putrefying interests, set fire to it, and perish
thereon.</p>

<p>The music began. It was the Dead March in
<i>Saul</i>. The long-rolling drums suddenly rent the
soul, and destroyed every base and petty thought
that was there. Clergy, headed by a bishop, were
walking down the cathedral. At the huge doors,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page56" id="page56">[56]</a></span>
nearly lost in the heavy twilight of November
noon, they stopped, turned and came back. The
coffin swayed into view, covered with the sacred
symbolic bunting, and borne on the shoulders of
eight sergeants of the old regiments of the dead
man. Then followed the pall-bearers&mdash;five field-marshals,
five full generals, and two admirals;
aged men, and some of them had reached the
highest dignity without giving a single gesture that
had impressed itself on the national mind; nonentities,
apotheosised by seniority; and some showed
traces of the bitter rain that was falling in the fog
outside. Then the Primate. Then the King, who
had supervened from nowhere, the magic production
of chamberlains and comptrollers. The
procession, headed by the clergy, moved slowly,
amid the vistas ending in the dull burning of
stained glass, through the congregation in mourning
and in khaki, through the lines of yellow-glowing
candelabra, towards the crowd of scarlet
under the dome; the summit of the dome was
hidden in soft mist. The music became insupportable
in its sublimity.</p>

<p>G.J. was afraid, and he did not immediately
know why he was afraid. The procession came
nearer. It was upon him.... He knew why
he was afraid, and he averted sharply his gaze from
the coffin. He was afraid for his composure. If
he had continued to watch the coffin he would
have burst into loud sobs. Only by an extraordinary
effort did he master himself. Many other
people lowered their faces in self-defence. The
searchers after new and violent sensations were
having the time of their lives.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page57" id="page57">[57]</a></span>
<p>The Dead March with its intolerable genius
had ceased. The coffin, guarded by flickering
candles, lay on the lofty catafalque; the eight
sergeants were pretending that their strength
had not been in the least degree taxed. Princes,
the illustrious, the champions of Allied might,
dark Indians, adventurers, even Germans, surrounded
the catafalque in the gloom. G.J.
sympathised with the man in the coffin, the simple
little man whose non-political mission had in
spite of him grown political. He regretted
horribly that once he, G.J., who protested that he
belonged to no party, had said of the dead man:
&quot;Roberts! Well-meaning of course, but senile!&quot; ... Yet
a trifle! What did it matter? And how
he loathed to think that the name of the dead man
was now befouled by the calculating and impure
praise of schemers. Another trifle!</p>

<p>As the service proceeded G.J. was overwhelmed
and lost in the grandeur and terror of
existence. There he sat, grizzled, dignified, with
the great world, looking as though he belonged to
the great world; and he felt like a boy, like a child,
like a helpless infant before the enormities of
destiny. He wanted help, because of his futility.
He could do nothing, or so little. It was as if he
had been training himself for twenty years in order
to be futile at a crisis requiring crude action. And
he could not undo twenty years. The war loomed
about him, co-extensive with existence itself. He
thought of the sergeant who, as recounted that
morning in the papers, had led a victorious storming
party, been decorated&mdash;and died of wounds.
And similar deeds were being done at that
<span class="newpage"><a name="page58" id="page58">[58]</a></span>
moment. And the simple little man in the coffin
was being tilted downwards from the catafalque
into the grave close by. G.J. wanted surcease,
were it but for an hour. He longed acutely,
unbearably, to be for an hour with Christine in her
warm, stuffy, exciting, languorous, enervating
room hermetically sealed against the war. Then
he remembered the tones of her voice as she had
told her Belgian adventures.... Was it love?
Was it tenderness? Was it sensuality? The difference
was indiscernible; it had no importance.
Against the stark background of infinite existence
all human beings were alike and all their passions
were alike.</p>

<p>The gaunt, ruthless autocrat of the War Office
and the frail crowned descendant of kings fronted
each other across the open grave, and the coffin
sank between them and was gone. From the
choir there came the chanted and soothing words:</p>

<i>Steals on the ear the distant triumph-song</i>.<br />

<p>G.J. just caught them clear among much that
was incomprehensible. An intense patriotism
filled him. He could do nothing; but he could
keep his head, keep his balance, practise magnanimity,
uphold the truth amid prejudice and
superstition, and be kind. Such at that moment
seemed to be his mission.... He looked round,
and pitied, instead of hating, the searchers after
sensations.</p>

<p>A being called the Garter King of Arms
stepped forward and in a loud voice recited the
earthly titles and honours of the simple little dead
man; and, although few qualities are commoner
<span class="newpage"><a name="page59" id="page59">[59]</a></span>
than physical courage, the whole catalogue seemed
ridiculous and tawdry until the being came to the
two words, &quot;Victoria Cross&quot;. The being, having
lived his glorious moments, withdrew. The
Funeral March of Chopin tramped with its
excruciating dragging tread across the ruins of the
soul. And finally the cathedral was startled by
the sudden trumpets of the Last Post, and the
ceremony ended.</p>

<p>&quot;Come and have lunch with me,&quot; said the
young red-hatted officer next to G.J. &quot;I haven't
got to be back till two-thirty, and I want to talk
music for a change. Do you know I'm putting
in ninety hours a week at the W.O.?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't,&quot; G.J. replied, with an affectation of
jauntiness. &quot;I'm engaged for lunch. Sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who you lunching with?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Smith.&quot;</p>

<p>The Staff officer exclaimed aghast:</p>

<p>&quot;Conception?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Why, dear heart?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear chap. You don't know. Carlos
Smith's been killed. <i>She</i> doesn't know yet. I
only heard by chance. News came through just
as I left. Nobody knows except a chap or two in
Casualties. They won't be sending out to-day's
wires until two or three o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J., terrified and at a loss, murmured:</p>

<p>&quot;What am I to do, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know her extremely well, don't you?
You ought to go and prepare her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But how can I prepare her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know. How do people prepare
people?... Poor thing!&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page60" id="page60">[60]</a></span>
<p>G.J. fought against the incredible fact of death.</p>

<p>&quot;But he only went out six days ago! They
haven't been married three weeks.&quot;</p>

<p>The central hardness of the other disclosed
itself as he said:</p>

<p>&quot;What's that got to do with it? What does
it matter if he went out six days ago or six weeks
ago? He's killed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course you must go. Indicate a rumour.
Tell her it's probably false, but you thought you
owed it to her to warn her. Only for God's sake
don't mention me. We're not supposed to say
anything, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. seemed to see his mission, and it challenged
him.</p>

<h4>THE TELEGRAM</h4>
<br />

<p>As soon as G.J. had been let into the abode by
Concepcion's venerable parlour-maid, the voice of
Concepcion came down to him from above:</p>

<p>&quot;G.J., who is your oldest and dearest friend?&quot;</p>

<p>He replied, marvellously schooling his voice to
a similar tone of cheerful abruptness:</p>

<p>&quot;Difficult to say, off-hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. It's your beard.&quot;</p>

<p>That was her greeting to him. He knew she
was recalling an old declined suggestion of hers
that he should part with his beard. The parlour-maid
practised an admirable deafness, faithfully to
confirm Concepcion, who always presumed deafness
in all servants. G.J. looked up the narrow
well of the staircase. He could vaguely see
Concepcion on high, leaning over the banisters;
he thought she was rather fluffilly dressed, for her.</p>

<p>Concepcion inhabited an upper part in a street
largely devoted to the sale of grand pianos. Her
front door was immediately at the top of a long,
straight, narrow stairway; so that whoever opened
the door stood one step higher than the person
desiring entrance. Within the abode, which was
fairly spacious, more and more stairs went up and
up. &quot;My motto is,&quot; she would say, &quot;'One room,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page62" id="page62">[62]</a></span>
one staircase.'&quot; The life of the abode was
on the busy stairs. She called it also her Alpine
Club. She had made upper-parts in that street
popular among the select, and had therefore
caused rents to rise. In the drawing-room she
had hung a horrible enlarged photographic portrait
of herself, with a chocolate-coloured mount,
the whole framed in German gilt, and under it
she had inscribed, &quot;Presented to Miss Concepcion
Iquist by the grateful landlords of the neighbourhood
as a slight token of esteem and regard.&quot;</p>

<p>She was the only daughter of Iquist's brother,
who had had a business and a palace at Lima.
At the age of eighteen, her last surviving parent
being dead, she had come to London and started
to keep house for the bachelor Iquist, who at that
very moment, owing to a fortunate change in the
Ministry, had humorously entered the Cabinet.
These two had immediately become &quot;the most
talked-of pair in London,&quot; London in this phrase
signifying the few thousand people who do talk
about the doings of other people unknown to
them and being neither kings, princes, statesmen,
artistes, artists, jockeys, nor poisoners. The
Iquists had led the semi-intelligent, conscious-of-its-audience
set which had ousted the old, quite unintelligent
stately-homes-of-England set from the first place in
the curiosity of the everlasting public. Concepcion had
wit. It was stated that she furnished her uncle with the
finest of his <i>mots</i>. When Iquist died, of course
poor Concepcion had retired to the upper part, whence,
though her position was naturally weakened, she still
took a hand in leading the set.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page63" id="page63">[63]</a></span>
<p>G.J. had grown friendly and appreciative of
her, for the simple reason that she had singled him
out and always tried to please him, even when
taking liberties with him. He liked her because
she was different from her set. She had a masculine
mind, whereas many even of the males of her
set had a feminine mind. She was exceedingly
well educated; she had ideas on everything; and
she never failed in catching an allusion. She
would criticise her set very honestly; her attitude
to it and to herself seemed to be that of an
impartial and yet indulgent philosopher; withal
she could be intensely loyal to fools and worse who
were friends. As for the public, she was apparently
convinced of the sincerity of her scorn for it,
while admitting that she enjoyed publicity,
which had become indispensable to her as a
drug may become indispensable. Moreover,
there was her wit and her candid, queer respect
for G.J.</p>

<p>Yes, he had greatly admired her for her
qualities. He did not, however, greatly admire her
physique. She was tall, with a head scarcely large
enough for her body. She had a nice snub nose
which in another woman might have been irresistible.
She possessed very little physical charm,
and showed very little taste in her neat, prim
frocks. Not merely had she a masculine mind,
but she was somewhat hard, a self-confessed
egoist. She swore like the set, using about one
&quot;damn&quot; or one &quot;bloody&quot; to every four cigarettes,
of which she smoked, perhaps, fifty a day&mdash;including
some in taxis. She discussed the sexual
vagaries of her friends and her enemies with a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page64" id="page64">[64]</a></span>
freedom and an apparent learning which were
remarkable in a virgin.</p>

<p>In the end she had married Carlos Smith, and,
characteristically, had received him into her own
home instead of going to his; as a fact, he had
none, having been a parent's close-kept darling.
London had only just recovered from the excitations
of the wedding. G.J. had regarded the
marriage with benevolence, perhaps with relief.</p>

<p>&quot;Anybody else coming to lunch?&quot; he discreetly
inquired of his familiar, the parlour-maid.</p>

<p>She breathed a negative.</p>

<p>He had guessed it. Concepcion had meant to
be alone with him. Having married for love, and
her husband being rapt away by the war, she
intended to resume her old, honest, quasi-sentimental
relations with G.J. A reliable and
experienced bachelor is always useful to a young
grass-widow, and, moreover, the attendant hopeless
adorer nourishes her hungry egotism as nobody
else can. G.J. thought these thoughts, clearly
and callously, in the same moment as, mounting
the next flight of stairs, he absolutely trembled
with sympathetic anguish for Concepcion. His
errand was an impossible one; he feared, or rather
he hoped, that the very look on his face might
betray the dreadful news to that undeceivable
intuition which women were supposed to possess.
He hesitated on the stairs; he recoiled from the
top step&mdash;(she had coquettishly withdrawn herself
into the room)&mdash;he hadn't the slightest idea how
to begin. Yes, the errand was an impossible one,
and yet such errands had to be performed by
somebody, were daily being performed by somebodies.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page65" id="page65">[65]</a></span>
Then he had the idea of telephoning
privily to fetch her cousin Sara. He would open
by remarking casually to Concepcion:</p>

<p>&quot;I say, can I use your telephone a minute?&quot;
He found a strange Concepcion in the drawing-room.
This was his first sight of Mrs. Carlos
Smith since the wedding. She wore a dress such
as he had never seen on her: a tea-gown&mdash;and
for lunch! It could be called neither neat nor
prim, but it was voluptuous. Her complexion
had bloomed; the curves of her face were softer,
her gestures more abandoned, her gaze full of a
bold and yet shamed self-consciousness, her dark
hair looser. He stood close to her; he stood
within the aura of her recently aroused temperament,
and felt it. He thought, could not help
thinking: &quot;Perhaps she bears within her the
legacy of new life.&quot; He could not help thinking
of her name. He took her hot hand. She said
nothing, but just looked at him. He then said
jauntily:</p>

<p>&quot;I say, can I use your telephone a minute?&quot;
Fortunately, the telephone was in the bedroom.
He went farther upstairs and shut himself
in the bedroom, and saw naught but the telephone
surrounded by the mysterious influences of
inanimate things in the gay, crowded room.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that you, Mrs. Trevise? It's G.J. speaking.
G.J.... Hoape. Yes. Listen. I'm at Concepcion's
for lunch, and I want you to come over
as quickly as you can. I've got very bad news
indeed&mdash;the worst possible. Carlos has been
killed at the Front. What? Yes, awful, isn't it?
She doesn't know. I have the job of telling her.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page66" id="page66">[66]</a></span>
<p>Now that the words had been spoken in Concepcion's
abode the reality of Carlos Smith's
death seemed more horribly convincing than
before. And G.J., speaker of the words, felt
almost as guilty as though he himself were
responsible for the death. When he had rung off
he stood motionless in the room until the opening
of the door startled him. Concepcion appeared.</p>

<p>&quot;If you've done corrupting my innocent telephone ...&quot;
she said, &quot;lunch is cooling.&quot;</p>

<p>He felt a murderer.</p>

<p>At the lunch-table she might have been a
genuine South American. Nobody could be less
like Christine than she was; and yet in those
instants she incomprehensibly reminded him of
Christine. Then she started to talk in her old
manner of a professional and renowned talker.
G.J. listened attentively. They ate. It was
astounding that he could eat. And it was rather
surprising that she did not cry out: &quot;G.J. What
the devil's the matter with you to-day?&quot; But
she went on talking evenly, and she made him
recount his doings. He related the conversation
at the club, and especially what Bob, the retired
judge, had said about equilibrium on the Western
Front. She did not want to hear anything as to
the funeral.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll have champagne,&quot; she said suddenly
to the parlour-maid, who was about to offer some
red wine. And while the parlour-maid was out of
the room she said to G.J., &quot;There isn't a country
in Europe where champagne is not a symbol, and
we must conform.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A symbol of what?&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page67" id="page67">[67]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Ah! The unusual.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what is there unusual to-day?&quot; he
almost asked, but did not ask. It would, of
course, have been utterly monstrous to put such
a question, knowing what he knew. He thought:
I'm not a bit nearer telling her than I was when
I came.</p>

<p>After the parlour-maid had poured out the
champagne Concepcion picked up her glass and
absently glanced through it and said:</p>

<p>&quot;You know, G.J., I shouldn't be in the
least surprised to hear that Carly was killed out
there. I shouldn't, really.&quot;</p>

<p>In amazement G.J. ceased to eat.</p>

<p>&quot;You needn't look at me like that,&quot; she said.
&quot;I'm quite serious. One may as well face the
risks. <i>He</i> does. Of course they're all heroes.
There are millions of heroes. But I do honestly
believe that my Carly would be braver than anyone.
By the way, did I ever tell you he was
considered the best shot in Cheshire?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. But I knew,&quot; answered G.J. feebly.
He would have expected her to be a little condescending
towards Carlos, to whom in brains she
was infinitely superior. But no! Carlos had
mastered her, and she was grateful to him for
mastering her. He had taught her in three weeks
more than she had learnt on two continents in
thirty years. She talked of him precisely as any
wee wifie might have talked of the soldier-spouse.
And she called him &quot;Carly&quot;!</p>

<p>Neither of them had touched the champagne.
G.J. decided that he would postpone any
attempt to tell her until her cousin arrived; her
<span class="newpage"><a name="page68" id="page68">[68]</a></span>
cousin might arrive at any moment now.</p>

<p>While the parlour-maid presented potatoes
Concepcion deliberately ignored her and said
dryly to G.J.:</p>

<p>&quot;I can't eat any more. I think I ought to
run along to Debenham and Freebody's at once.
You might come too, and be sure to bring your
good taste with you.&quot;</p>

<p>He was alarmed by her tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Debenham and Freebody's! What for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To order mourning, of course. To have it
ready, you know. A precaution, you know.&quot;
She laughed.</p>

<p>He saw that she was becoming hysterical: the
special liability of the war-bride for whom the
curtain has been lifted and falls exasperatingly,
enragingly, too soon.</p>

<p>&quot;You think I'm a bit hysterical?&quot; she questioned,
half menacingly, and stood up.</p>

<p>&quot;I think you'd better sit down, to begin with,&quot;
he said firmly.</p>

<p>The parlour-maid, blushing slightly, left the
room.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, all right!&quot; Concepcion agreed carelessly,
and sat down. &quot;But you may as well read that.&quot;</p>

<p>She drew a telegram from the low neck of her
gown and carefully unfolded it and placed it in
front of him. It was a War Office telegram
announcing that Carlos had been killed.</p>

<p>&quot;It came ten minutes before you,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Why didn't you tell me at once?&quot; he
murmured, frightfully shocked. He was actually
reproaching her!</p>

<p>She stood up again. She lived; her breast
<span class="newpage"><a name="page69" id="page69">[69]</a></span>
rose and fell. Her gown had the same voluptuousness.
Her temperament was still emanating the
same aura. She was the same new Concepcion,
strange and yet profoundly known to him. But
ineffable tragedy had marked her down, and the
sight of her parched the throat.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>&quot;Couldn't. Besides, I had to see if I could
stand it. Because I've got to stand it, G.J....
And, moreover, in our set it's a sacred duty to
be original.&quot;</p>

<p>She snatched the telegram, tore it in two, and
pushed the pieces back into her gown.</p>

<p>&quot;'Poor wounded name!'&quot; she murmured,
&quot;'my bosom as a bed shall lodge thee.'&quot;</p>

<p>The next moment she fell to the floor, at full
length on her back. G.J. sprang to her, kneeling
on her rich, outspread gown, and tried to lift her.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no!&quot; she protested faintly, dreamily,
with a feeble frown on her pale forehead. &quot;Let
me lie. Equilibrium has been established on the
Western Front.&quot;</p>

<p>This was her greatest <i>mot</i>.</p>

<h4>RENDEZVOUS</h4>
<br />

<p>When the Italian woman, having recognised
him with a discreet smile, introduced G.J. into
the drawing-room of the Cork Street flat, he saw
Christine lying on the sofa by the fire. She too
was in a tea-gown.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>&quot;Do not be vexed. I have my migraine&mdash;am
good for nothing. But I gave the order that thou
shouldst be admitted.&quot;</p>

<p>She lifted her arms, and the long sleeves fell
away. G.J. bent down and kissed her. She
joined her hands on the nape of his neck, and with
this leverage raised her whole body for an instant,
like a child, smiling; then dropped back with a
fatigued sigh, also like a child. He found satisfaction
in the fact that she was laid aside. It was
providential. It set him right with himself. For,
to put the thing crudely, he had left the tragic
Concepcion to come to Christine, a woman picked
up in a Promenade.</p>

<p>True, Sara Trevise had agreed with him that he
could accomplish no good by staying at Concepcion's;
Concepcion had withdrawn from the
vision of men. True, it could make no difference
to Concepcion whether he retired to his flat for the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page71" id="page71">[71]</a></span>
rest of the day and saw no one, or whether, having
changed his ceremonious clothes there, he went
out again on his own affairs. True, he had
promised Christine to see her that afternoon, and
a promise was a promise, and Christine was a
woman who had behaved well to him, and it
would have been impossible for him to send her
an excuse, since he did not know her surname.
These apparently excellent arguments were
specious and worthless. He would, anyhow, have
gone to Christine. The call was imperious within
him, and took no heed of grief, nor propriety,
nor the secret decencies of sympathy. The
primitive man in him would have gone to
Christine.</p>

<p>He sat down with a profound and exquisite
relief. The entrance to the house was nearly
opposite the entrance to a prim but fashionable
and expensive hotel. To ring (and ring the right
bell) and wait at Christine's door almost under the
eyes of the hotel was an ordeal.... The fat and
untidy Italian had opened the door, and shut it
again&mdash;quick! He was in another world, saved,
safe! On the dark staircase the image of Concepcion
with her temperament roused and
condemned to everlasting hunger, the unconquerable
Concepcion blasted in an instant of destiny&mdash;this
image faded. She would re-marry.... She
ought to re-marry.... And now he was in
Christine's warm room, and Christine, temporary
invalid, reclined before his eyes. The lights were
turned on, the blinds drawn, the stove replenished,
the fire replenished. He was enclosed with
Christine in a little world with no law and no
<span class="newpage"><a name="page72" id="page72">[72]</a></span>
conventions except its own, and no shames nor
pretences. He was, as it were, in the East. And the
immanence of a third person, the Italian, accepting
naturally and completely the code of the little
world, only added to the charm. The Italian was
like a slave, from whom it is necessary to hide
nothing and never to blush.</p>

<p>A stuffy little world with a perceptible odour!
Ordinarily he had the common insular appetite
for ventilation, but now stuffiness appealed to
him; he scented it almost voluptuously. The
ugliness of the wallpaper, of the furniture, of
everything in the room was naught. Christine's
profession was naught. Who could positively
say that her profession was on her face, in her
gestures, in her talk? Admirable as was his
knowledge of French, it was not enough to enable
him to criticise her speech. Her gestures were
delightful. Her face&mdash;her face was soft; her
puckered brow was touching in its ingenuousness.
She had a kind and a trustful eye; it was a lewd
eye, indicative of her incomparable endowment;
but had he not encountered the lewd eye in the
very arcana of the respectability of the world
outside? On the sofa, open and leaves downward,
lay a book with a glistening coloured cover,
entitled <i>Fantomas</i>. It was the seventh volume of
an interminable romance which for years had
had a tremendous vogue among the concierges,
the workgirls, the clerks, and the <i>cocottes</i> of Paris.
An unreadable affair, not even indecent, which
nevertheless had enchanted a whole generation.
To be able to enjoy it was an absolute demonstration
of lack of taste; but did not some of his best
<span class="newpage"><a name="page73" id="page73">[73]</a></span>
friends enjoy books no better? And could he
not any day in any drawing-room see martyred
books dropped open and leaves downwards in a
manner to raise the gorge of a person of any
bookish sensibility?</p>

<p>&quot;Thou wilt play for me?&quot; she suggested.</p>

<p>&quot;But the headache?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will do me good. I adore music, such
music as thou playest.&quot;</p>

<p>He was flattered. The draped piano was close
to him. Stretching out his hand he took a little
pile of music from the top of it.</p>

<p>&quot;But you play, then!&quot; he exclaimed, pleased.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no! I tap&mdash;only. And very little.&quot;</p>

<p>He glanced through the pieces of music. They
were all, without exception, waltzes, by the once
popular waltz-kings of Paris and Vienna, including
several by the king of kings, Berger. He
seated himself at the piano and opened the first
waltz that came.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! I adore the waltzes of Berger,&quot; she
murmured. &quot;There is only he. You don't think so?&quot;</p>

<p>He said he had never heard any of this music.
Then he played every piece for her. He tried to
see what it was in this music that so pleased the
simple; and he saw it, or he thought he saw it. He
abandoned himself to the music, yielding to it,
accepting its ideals, interpreting it as though it
moved him, until in the end it did produce in him
a sort of factitious emotion. After all, it was no
worse than much of the music he was forced to
hear in very refined circles.</p>

<p>She said, ravished:</p>

<p>&quot;You decipher music like an angel.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page74" id="page74">[74]</a></span>
<p>And hummed a fragment of the waltz from
<i>The Rosenkavalier</i> which he had played for her
two evenings earlier. He glanced round sharply.
Had she, then, real taste?</p>

<p>&quot;It is like that, isn't it?&quot; she questioned, and
hummed it again, flattered by the look on his face.</p>

<p>While, at her invitation, he repeated the waltz
on the piano, whose strings might have been made
of zinc, he heard a ring at the outer door and then
the muffled sound of a colloquy between a male
voice and the voice of the Italian. &quot;Of course,&quot;
he admitted philosophically, &quot;she has other clients
already.&quot; Such a woman was bound to have other
clients. He felt no jealousy, nor even discomfort,
from the fact that she lent herself to any male with
sufficient money and a respectable appearance.
The colloquy expired.</p>

<p>&quot;Ring, please,&quot; she requested, after thanking
him. He hoped that she was not going to interrogate
the Italian in his presence. Surely she would
be incapable of such clumsiness! Still, women
without imagination&mdash;and the majority of women
were without imagination&mdash;did do the most
astounding things.</p>

<p>There was no immediate answer to the bell;
but in a few minutes the Italian entered with a
tea-tray. Christine sat up.</p>

<p>&quot;I will pour the tea,&quot; said she, and to the
Italian: &quot;Marthe, where is the evening paper?&quot;
And when Marthe returned with a newspaper
damp from the press, Christine said: &quot;To
Monsieur....&quot;</p>

<p>Not a word of curiosity as to the unknown visitor!</p>

<p>G.J. was amply confirmed in his original
<span class="newpage"><a name="page75" id="page75">[75]</a></span>
opinion of Christine. She was one in a hundred.
To provide the evening paper.... It was nothing,
but it was enormous.</p>

<p>&quot;Sit by my side,&quot; she said. She made just
a little space for him on the sofa&mdash;barely enough
so that he had to squeeze in. The afternoon tea
was correct, save for the extraordinary thickness
of the bread-and-butter. But G.J. said to himself
that the French did not understand bread-and-butter,
and the Italians still less. To compensate
for the defects of the bread-and-butter there
was a box of fine chocolates.</p>

<p>&quot;I perfect my English,&quot; she said. Tea was
finished; they were smoking, the <i>Evening News</i>
spread between them over the tea-things. She
articulated with a strong French accent the words
of some of the headings. &quot;Mistair Carlos Smith
keeled at the front,&quot; she read out. &quot;Who is it, that
woman there? She must be celebrated.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a portrait of the illustrious Concepcion,
together with some sympathetic remarks
about her, remarks conceived very differently
from the usual semi-ironic, semi-worshipping
journalistic references to the stars of Concepcion's
set. G.J. answered vaguely.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not like too much these society women.
They are worse than us, and they cost you more.
Ah! If the truth were known&mdash;&quot; Christine
spoke with a queer, restrained, surprising bitterness.
Then she added, softly relenting: &quot;However,
it is sad for her.... Who was he, this
monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. replied that he was nobody in particular,
so far as his knowledge went.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page76" id="page76">[76]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Ah! One of those who are husbands of their
wives!&quot; said Christine acidly.</p>

<p>The disturbing intuition of women!</p>

<p>A little later he said that he must depart.</p>

<p>&quot;But why? I feel better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have a committee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A committee?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a work of charity&mdash;for the French
wounded.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! In that case.... But, beloved!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p>She lowered her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;How dost thou call thyself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gilbert.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thou knowest&mdash;I have a fancy for thee.&quot;</p>

<p>Her tone was delicious, its sincerity absolutely
convincing.</p>

<p>&quot;Too amiable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no. It is true. Say! Return. Return
after thy committee. Take me out to dinner&mdash;some
gentle little restaurant, discreet. There must
be many of them in a city like London. It is a
city so romantic. Oh! The little corners of
London!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But&mdash;of course. I should be enchanted&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then.&quot;</p>

<p>He was standing. She raised her smiling,
seductive face. She was young&mdash;younger than
Concepcion; less battered by the world's contacts
than Concepcion. She had the inexpressible virtue
and power of youth. He was nearing fifty. And
she, perhaps half his age, had confessed his charm.</p>

<p>&quot;And say! My Gilbert. Bring me a few
flowers. I have not been able to go out to-day.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page77" id="page77">[77]</a></span>
Something very simple. I detest that one should
squander money on flowers for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seven-thirty, then!&quot; said he. &quot;And you will
be ready?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be very exact. Thou wilt tell me all
that concerns thy committee. That interests me.
The English are extraordinary.&quot;</p>

<h4>IN COMMITTEE</h4>
<br />

<p>Within the hotel the glowing Gold Hall,
whose Lincrusta Walton panels dated it, was nearly
empty. Of the hundred small round tables only
one was occupied; a bald head and a large green
hat were almost meeting over the top of this
table, but there was nothing on it except an ashtray.
A waiter wandered about amid the thick
plushy silence and the stagnant pools of electric
light, meditating upon the curse which had
befallen the world of hotels. The red lips beneath
the green hat discernibly moved, but no faintest
murmur therefrom reached the entrance. The
hot, still place seemed to be enchanted.</p>

<p>The sight of the hotel flower-stall recessed on
the left reminded G.J. of Christine's desire.
Forty thousand skilled women had been put out
of work in England because luxury was scared by
the sudden vista of war, but the black-garbed girl,
entrenched in her mahogany bower, was still earning
some sort of a livelihood. In a moment,
wakened out of her terrible boredom into an alert
smile, she had sold to G.J. a bunch of expensive
chrysanthemums whose yellow petals were like
long curly locks. Thoughtless, he had meant to
have the flowers delivered at once to Christine's
<span class="newpage"><a name="page79" id="page79">[79]</a></span>
flat. It would not do; it would be indiscreet.
And somehow, in the absence of Braiding, it
would be equally indiscreet to have them delivered
at his own flat.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be leaving the hotel in about an hour;
I'll take them away myself then,&quot; he said, and
inquired for the headquarters of the Lechford
French Hospitals Committee.</p>

<p>&quot;Committee?&quot; repeated the girl vaguely. &quot;I
expect the Onyx Hall's what you want.&quot; She
pointed up a corridor, and gave change.</p>

<p>G.J. discovered the Onyx Hall, which had its
own entrance from the street, and which in other
days had been a caf&eacute; lounge. The precious
pavement was now half hidden by wooden trestles,
wooden cubicles, and cheap chairs. Temporary
flexes brought down electric light from a stained
glass dome to illuminate card-indexes and pigeon-holes
and piles of letters. Notices in French and
Flemish were suspended from the ornate onyx
pilasters. Old countrywomen and children in
rough foreign clothes, smart officers in strange
uniforms, privates in shabby blue, gentlemen in
morning coats and spats, and untidy Englishwomen
with eyes romantic, hard, or wistful, were
mixed together in the Onyx Hall, where there was
no enchantment and little order, save that good
French seemed to be regularly spoken on one side
of the trestles and regularly assassinated on the
other. G.J., mystified, caught the grey eye of a
youngish woman with a tired and fretful expression.</p>

<p>&quot;And you?&quot; she inquired perfunctorily.</p>

<p>He demanded, with hesitation:</p>

<p>&quot;Is this the Lechford Committee?&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page80" id="page80">[80]</a></span>
<p>&quot;The what Committee?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Lechford Committee headquarters.&quot; He
thought she might be rather an attractive little
thing at, say, an evening party.</p>

<p>She gave him a sardonic look and answered,
not rudely, but with large tolerance:</p>

<p>&quot;Can't you read?&quot;</p>

<p>By means of gesture scarcely perceptible she
directed his attention to an immense linen sign
stretched across the back of the big room, and
he saw that he was in the ant-heap of some Belgian
Committee.</p>

<p>&quot;So sorry to have troubled you!&quot; he apologised.
&quot;I suppose you don't happen to know where the
Lechford Committee sits?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never heard of it,&quot; said she with cheerful
disdain. Then she smiled and he smiled. &quot;You
know, the hotel simply hums with committees, but
this is the biggest by a long way. They can't
let their rooms, so it costs them nothing to lend
them for patriotic purposes.&quot;</p>

<p>He liked the chit.</p>

<p>Presently, with a page-boy, he was ascending
in a lift through storey after storey of silent
carpeted desert. Light alternated with darkness,
winking like a succession of days and nights as
seen by a god. The infant showed him into a
private parlour furnished and decorated in almost
precisely the same taste as Christine's sitting-room,
where a number of men and women sat
close together at a long deal table, whose pale,
classic simplicity clashed with the rest of the
apartment. A thin, dark, middle-aged man of
austere visage bowed to him from the head of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page81" id="page81">[81]</a></span>
table. Somebody else indicated a chair, which,
with a hideous, noisy scraping over the bare
floor, he modestly insinuated between two occupied
chairs. A third person offered a typewritten
sheet containing the agenda of the meeting. A
blonde girl was reading in earnest, timid tones the
minutes of the previous meeting. The affair had
just begun. As soon as the minutes had been
passed the austere chairman turned and said
evenly:</p>

<p>&quot;I am sure I am expressing the feelings of
the committee in welcoming among us Mr. Hoape,
who has so kindly consented to join us and give us
the benefit of his help and advice in our labours.&quot;</p>

<p>Sympathetic murmurs converged upon G.J.
from the four sides of the table, and G.J. nervously
murmured a few incomprehensible words, feeling
both foolish and pleased. He had never sat on a
committee; and as his war-conscience troubled him
more and more daily, he was extremely anxious to
start work which might placate it. Indeed, he
had seized upon the request to join the committee
as a swimmer in difficulties clasps the gunwale of
a dinghy.</p>

<p>A man who kept his gaze steadily on the table
cleared his throat and said:</p>

<p>&quot;The matter is not in order, Mr. Chairman,
but I am sure I am expressing the feelings of the
committee in proposing a vote of condolence to
yourself on the terrible loss which you have sustained
in the death of your son at the Front.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I beg to second that,&quot; said a lady quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;Our chairman has given his only son&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Tears came into her eyes; she seemed to appeal
<span class="newpage"><a name="page82" id="page82">[82]</a></span>
for help. There were &quot;Hear, hears,&quot; and more
sympathetic murmurs.</p>

<p>The proposer, with his gaze still steadily fixed
on the table, said:</p>

<p>&quot;I beg to put the resolution to the meeting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the chairman with calm self-control
in the course of his acknowledgment. &quot;And if I
had ten sons I would willingly give them all&mdash;for
the cause.&quot; And his firm, hard glance appeared
to challenge any member of the committee to
assert that this profession of parental and patriotic
generosity of heart was not utterly sincere. However,
nobody had the air of doubting that if the
chairman had had ten sons, or as many sons as
Solomon, he would have sacrificed them all with
the most admirable and eager heroism.</p>

<p>The agenda was opened. G.J. had little but
newspaper knowledge of the enterprises of the
committee, and it would not have been proper to
waste the time of so numerous a company in
enlightening him. The common-sense custom
evidently was that new members should &quot;pick up
the threads as they went along.&quot; G.J. honestly
tried to do so. But he was preoccupied with the
personalities of the committee. He soon saw
that the whole body was effectively divided
into two classes&mdash;the chairmen of the various
sub-committees, and the rest. Few members were
interested in any particular subject. Those who
were not interested either stared at the walls or at
the agenda paper, or laboriously drew intricate
and meaningless designs on the agenda paper, or
folded up the agenda paper into fantastic shapes
until, when someone in authority brought out
<span class="newpage"><a name="page83" id="page83">[83]</a></span>
the formula, &quot;I think the view of the committee
will be&mdash;&quot; a resolution was put and the issue
settled by the mechanical raising of hands on the
fulcrum of the elbow. And at each raising of
hands everybody felt that something positive had
indeed been accomplished.</p>

<p>The new member was a little discouraged. He
had the illusion that the two hospitals run in
France for French soldiers by the Lechford Committee
were an illusion, that they did not really
exist, that the committee was discussing an
abstraction. Nevertheless, each problem as it was
presented&mdash;the drains (postponed), the repairs to
the motor-ambulances, the ordering of a new
X-ray apparatus, the dilatoriness of a French
Minister in dealing with correspondence, the cost
per day per patient, the relations with the French
civil authorities and the French military authorities,
the appointment of a new matron who could
keep the peace with the senior doctor, and the
great principle involved in deducting five francs
fifty centimes for excess luggage from a nurse's
account for travelling expenses&mdash;each problem
helped to demonstrate that the hospitals did exist
and that men and women were toiling therein, and
that French soldiers in grave need were being
magnificently cared for and even saved from death.
And it was plain, too, that none of these excellent
things could have come to pass or could continue
to occur if the committee did not regularly sit
round the table and at short intervals perform
the rite of raising hands....</p>

<p>G.J.'s attention wandered. He could not
keep his mind off the thought that he should soon
<span class="newpage"><a name="page84" id="page84">[84]</a></span>
be seeing Christine again. Sitting at the table
with a mien of intelligent interest, he had a
waking dream of Christine. He saw her just as she
was&mdash;ingenuous, and ignorant if you like&mdash;except
that she was pure. Her purity, though, had not
cooled her temperament, and thus she combined
in herself the characteristics of at least two different
women, both of whom were necessary to
his happiness. And she was his wife, and they
lived in a roomy house in Hyde Park Gardens,
and the war was over. And she adored him and he
was passionately fond of her. And she was always
having children; she enjoyed having children; she
demanded children; she had a child every year
and there was never any trouble. And he never
admired her more poignantly than at the periods
just before his children were born, when she had
the vast, exquisitely swelling figure of the French
Renaissance Virgin in marble that stood on a
console in his drawing-room at the Albany....
Such was G.J.'s dream as he assisted in the
control of the Lechford Hospitals. Emerging from
it he looked along the table. Quite half the members
were dreaming too, and he wondered what
thoughts were moving secretly within them. But
the chairman was not dreaming. He never loosed
his grasp of the matter in hand. Nor did the
earnest young blonde by the chairman's side who
took down in stenography the decisions of the
committee.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page85" id="page85">[85]</a></span>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="Chapter_14"></a><h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<h4>QUEEN</h4>
<br />

<p>Then Lady Queenie Paulle entered rather
hurriedly, filling the room with a distinguished
scent. All the men rose in haste, and there was a
frightful scraping of chair-legs on the floor. Lady
Queenie cheerfully apologised for being late, and,
begging no one to disturb himself, took a modest
place between the chairman and the secretary
and a little behind them.</p>

<p>Lady Queenie obviously had what is called
&quot;race&quot;. The renown of her family went back
far, far beyond its special Victorian vogue, which
had transformed an earldom into a marquisate
and which, incidentally, was responsible for the
new family Christian name that Queenie herself
bore. She was young, tall, slim and pale, and
dressed with the utmost smartness in black&mdash;her
half-brother having gloriously lost his life in September.
She nodded to the secretary, who blushed
with pleasure, and she nodded to several members,
including G.J. Being accustomed to publicity
and to seeing herself nearly every week in either
<i>The Tatler</i> or <i>The Sketch</i>, she was perfectly at
ease in the room, and the fact that nearly the
whole company turned to her as plants to the
sun did not in the least disturb her.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page86" id="page86">[86]</a></span>
<p>The attention which she received was her due,
for she had few rivals as a war-worker. She was
connected with the Queen's Work for Women
Fund, Queen Mary's Needlework Guild, the Three
Arts Fund, the Women's Emergency Corps, and
many minor organisations. She had joined a
Women's Suffrage Society because such societies
were being utilised by the Government. She had
had ten lessons in First Aid in ten days, had donned
the Red Cross, and gone to France with two motor-cars
and a staff and a French maid in order to
help in the great national work of nursing wounded
heroes; and she might still have been in France
had not an unsympathetic and audacious colonel
of the R.A.M.C. insisted on her being shipped
back to England. She had done practically everything
that a patriotic girl could do for the war,
except, perhaps, join a Voluntary Aid Detachment
and wash dishes and scrub floors for fifteen hours
a day and thirteen and a half days a fortnight. It
was from her mother that she had inherited the
passion for public service. The Marchioness of
Lechford had been the cause of more philanthropic
work in others than any woman in the
whole history of philanthropy. Lady Lechford had
said, &quot;Let there be Lechford Hospitals in France,&quot;
and lo! there were Lechford Hospitals in France.
When troublesome complications arose Lady
Lechford had, with true self-effacement, surrendered
the establishments to a thoroughly
competent committee, and while retaining a seat
on the committee for herself and another for
Queenie, had curved tirelessly away to the
inauguration of fresh and more exciting schemes.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page87" id="page87">[87]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Mamma was very sorry she couldn't come
this afternoon,&quot; said Lady Queenie, addressing
the chairman.</p>

<p>The formula of those with authority in deciding
now became:</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know exactly what Lady Lechford's
view is, but I venture to think&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Then suddenly the demeanour of every member
of the committee was quickened, everybody
listened intently to everything that was said;
a couple of members would speak together;
pattern-designing and the manufacture of paper ships,
chains, and flowers ceased; it was as though a
tonic had been mysteriously administered to each
individual in the enervating room. The cause of
the change was a recommendation from the
hospitals management sub-committee that it be
an instruction to the new matron of the smaller
hospital to forbid any nurse and any doctor to go
out alone together in the evening. Scandal was
insinuated; nothing really wrong, but a bad impression
produced upon the civilians of the tiny
town, who could not be expected to understand
the holy innocence which underlies the superficial
license of Anglo-Saxon manners. The personal
characters and strange idiosyncrasies of every
doctor and every nurse were discussed; broad
principles of conduct were enunciated, together
with the advantages and disadvantages of those
opposite poles, discipline and freedom. The
argument continually expanded, branching forth
like the timber of a great oak-tree from the trunk,
and the minds of the committee ran about the
tree like monkeys. The interest was endless. A
<span class="newpage"><a name="page88" id="page88">[88]</a></span>
quiet delegate who had just returned from a visit
to the tiny town completely blasted one part of the
argument by asserting that the hospital bore a
blameless reputation among the citizens; but
new arguments were instantly constructed by the
adherents of the idea of discipline. The committee
had plainly split into two even parties. G.J.
began to resent the harshness of the disciplinarians.</p>

<p>&quot;I think we should remember,&quot; he said in his
modest voice, &quot;I think we should remember that
we are dealing with adult men and women.&quot;</p>

<p>The libertarians at once took him for their own.
The disciplinarians gave him to understand with
their eyes that it might have been better if he, as
a new member attending his first meeting, had
kept silence. The discussion was inflamed. One
or two people glanced surreptitiously at their
watches. The hour had long passed six thirty.
G.J. grew anxious about his rendezvous with
Christine. He had enjoined exactitude upon
Christine. But the main body of the excited and
happy committee had no thought of the flight of
time. The amusements of the tiny town came up
for review. As a fact, there was only one amusement,
the cinema. The whole town went to the
cinema. Cinemas were always darkened; human
nature was human nature.... G.J. had an
extraordinarily realistic vision of the hospital
staff slaving through its long and heavy day and its
everlasting week and preparing in sections to
amuse itself on certain evenings, and thinking with
pleasant anticipation of the ecstasies of the cinema,
and pathetically unsuspicious that its fate was
<span class="newpage"><a name="page89" id="page89">[89]</a></span>
being decided by a council of omnipotent deities
in the heaven of a London hotel.</p>

<p>&quot;Mamma has never mentioned the subject to
me,&quot; said Lady Queenie in response to a question,
looking at her rich muff.</p>

<p>&quot;This is a question of principle,&quot; said somebody
sharply, implying that at last individual consciences
were involved and that the opinions of the
Marchioness of Lechford had ceased to weigh.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid it's getting late,&quot; said the impassive
chairman. &quot;We must come to some decision.&quot;</p>

<p>In the voting Lady Queenie, after hesitation,
raised her hand with the disciplinarians. By one
vote the libertarians were defeated, and the dalliance
of the hospital staff in leisure hours received
a severe check.</p>

<p>&quot;She <i>would</i>&mdash;of course!&quot; breathed a sharp-nosed
little woman in the chair next but one to
G.J., gazing inimically at the lax mouth and
cynical eyes of Lady Queenie, who for four years had
been the subject of universal whispering, and some
shouting, and one or two ferocious battles in London.</p>

<p>Chair-legs scraped. People rose here and there
to go as they rise in a music hall after the Scottish
comedian has retired, bowing, from his final
encore. They protested urgent appointments
elsewhere. The chairman remarked that other
important decisions yet remained to be taken;
but his voice had no insistence because he had
already settled the decisions in his own mind.
G.J. seized the occasion to depart.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Hoape,&quot; the chairman detained him a
moment. &quot;The committee hope you will allow
yourself to be nominated to the accounts sub-committee.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page90" id="page90">[90]</a></span>
We understand that you are by way
of being an expert. The sub-committee meets on
Wednesday mornings at eleven&mdash;doesn't it, Sir
Charles?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Half-past,&quot; said Sir Charles.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Half-past.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J., somewhat surprised to learn of his
expertise in accountancy, consented to the suggestion,
which renewed his resolution, impaired
somewhat by the experience of the meeting, to
be of service in the world.</p>

<p>&quot;You will receive the notice, of course,&quot; said
the chairman.</p>

<p>Down below, just as G.J. was getting away
with Christine's chrysanthemums in their tissue
paper, Lady Queenie darted out of the lift
opposite. It was she who, at Concepcion's
instigation, had had him put in the committee.</p>

<p>&quot;I say, Queen,&quot; he said with a casual air&mdash;on
account of the flowers, &quot;who's been telling
'em I know about accounts?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; she said maliciously. &quot;Don't you
keep an account of every penny you spend?&quot;
(It was true.)</p>

<p>Here was a fair example of her sardonic and
unscrupulous humour&mdash;a humour not of words
but of acts. G.J. simply tossed his head, aware of
the futility of expostulation.</p>

<p>She went on in a different tone:</p>

<p>&quot;You were the first to see Connie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;She has lain in my arms all afternoon,&quot; Lady
<span class="newpage"><a name="page91" id="page91">[91]</a></span>
Queenie burst out, her voice liquid. &quot;And now
I'm going straight back to her.&quot; She looked at
him with the strangest triumphant expression.
Then her large, equivocal blue eyes fell from
his face to the flowers, and their expression
simultaneously altered to disdainful amusement
full of mischievous implications. She ran off
without another word. The glazed entrance doors
revolved, and he saw her nip into an electric
brougham, which, before he had time to button
his overcoat, vanished like an apparition in the
rainy mist.</p>

<h4>EVENING OUT</h4>
<br />

<p>He found Christine exactly as he had left her,
in the same tea-gown and the same posture, and
on the same sofa. But a small table had been put
by the sofa; and on this table was a penny bottle
of ink in a saucer, and a pen. She was studying
some kind of official form. The pucker between
the eyes was very marked.</p>

<p>&quot;Already!&quot; she exclaimed, as if amazed.
&quot;But there is not a clock that goes, and I had
not the least idea of the hour. Besides, I was
splitting my head to fill up this form.&quot;</p>

<p>Such was her notion of being exact! He had
abandoned an important meeting of a committee
which was doing untold mercies to her compatriots
in order to keep his appointment with
her; and she, whose professional business it was
that evening to charm him and harmonise with
him, had merely flouted the appointment. Nevertheless,
her gestures and smile as she rose and
came towards him were so utterly exquisite that
immediately he also flouted the appointment.
What, after all, could it matter whether they
dined at eight, nine, or even ten o'clock?</p>

<p>&quot;Thou wilt pardon me, monster?&quot; she murmured,
kissing him.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page93" id="page93">[93]</a></span>
<p>No woman had ever put her chin up to his as
she did, nor with a glance expressed so unreserved
a surrender to his masculinity.</p>

<p>She went on, twining languishingly round him:</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know whether I ought to go out.
I am yet far from&mdash;It is perhaps imprudent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Absurd!&quot; he protested&mdash;he could not bear
the thought of her not dining with him. He
knew too well the desolation of a solitary dinner.
&quot;Absurd! We go in a taxi. The restaurant is
warm. We return in a taxi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To please thee, then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is that form?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is for the telephone. Thou understandest
how it is necessary that I have the telephone&mdash;me!
But I comprehend nothing of this form.&quot;</p>

<p>She passed him the form. She had written
her name in the space allotted. &quot;Christine
Dubois.&quot; A fair calligraphy! But what a name!
The French equivalent of &quot;Smith&quot;. Nothing
could be less distinguished. Suddenly it occurred
to him that Concepcion's name also was Smith.</p>

<p>&quot;I will fill it up for you. It is quite simple.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is possible that it is simple when one is
English. But English&mdash;that is as if to say Chinese.
Everything contrary. Here is a pen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I have my fountain-pen.&quot; He hated
a cheap pen, and still more a penny bottle of ink,
but somehow this particular penny bottle of ink
seemed touching in its simple ugliness. She was
eminently teachable. He would teach her his
own attitude towards penny bottles of ink....
Of course she would need the telephone&mdash;that
could not be denied.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page94" id="page94">[94]</a></span>
<p>As Christine was signing the form Marthe
entered with the chrysanthemums, which he had
handed over to her; she had arranged them in a
horrible blue glass vase cheaply gilded; and while
Marthe was putting the vase on the small table
there was a ring at the outer door. Marthe
hurried off.</p>

<p>Christine said, kissing him again tenderly:</p>

<p>&quot;Thou art a squanderer! Fine for me to tell
thee not to buy costly flowers! Thou has spent
at least ten shillings for these. With ten
shillings&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no!&quot; he interrupted her. &quot;Five.&quot; It
was a fib. He had paid half a guinea for the few
flowers, but he could not confess it.</p>

<p>They could hear a powerful voice indistinctly
booming at the top of the stairs. &quot;Two callers
on one afternoon!&quot; G.J. reflected. And yet
she had told him she went out for the first time
only the day before yesterday! He scarcely liked
it, but his reason rescued him from the puerility
of a grievance against her on this account.
&quot;And why not? She is bound to be a marked
success.&quot;</p>

<p>Marthe returned to the drawing-room and shut
the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Madame&mdash;&quot; she began, slightly agitated.</p>

<p>&quot;Speak, then!&quot; Christine urged, catching her
agitation.</p>

<p>&quot;It is the police!&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. had a shock. He knew many of the policemen
who lurked in the dark doorways of Piccadilly
at night, had little friendly talks with them, held
them for excellent fellows. But a policeman
<span class="newpage"><a name="page95" id="page95">[95]</a></span>
invading the flat of a courtesan, and himself in
the flat, seemed a different being from the honest
stalwarts who threw the beams of lanterns
on the key-holes of jewellers' shops.</p>

<p>Christine steeled herself to meet the crisis with
self-reliance. She pointedly did not appeal to the
male.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what is it that he wants?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He talks of the chimney. It appears this
morning there was a chimney on fire. But since
we burn only anthracite and gas&mdash;He knows
madame's name.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause. Christine asked sharply
and mysteriously:</p>

<p>&quot;How much do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If madame gave five pounds&mdash;having regard
to the <i>chic</i> of the quarter.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine rushed into the bedroom and came
back with a five-pound note.</p>

<p>&quot;Here! Chuck that at him&mdash;politely. Tell him
we are very sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, madame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he'll never take it. You can't treat the
London police like that!&quot; G.J. could not help
expostulating as soon as Marthe had gone. He
feared some trouble.</p>

<p>&quot;My poor friend!&quot; Christine replied patronisingly.
&quot;Thou art not up in these things. Marthe
knows her affair&mdash;a woman very experienced in
London. He will take it, thy policeman. And
if I do not deceive myself no more chimneys
will burn for about a year.... Ah! The police
do not wipe their noses with broken bottles!&quot;
(She meant that the police knew their way
<span class="newpage"><a name="page96" id="page96">[96]</a></span>
about.) &quot;I no more than they, I do not wipe
my nose with broken bottles.&quot;</p>

<p>She was moved, indignant, stoutly defensive.
G.J. grew self-conscious. Moreover, her slang
disturbed him. It was the first slang he had
heard her use, and in using it her voice had
roughened. But he remembered that Concepcion
also used slang&mdash;and advanced slang&mdash;upon
occasion.</p>

<p>The booming ceased; a door closed. Marthe
returned once more.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is gone. He was very nice, madame. I told
him about madame&mdash;that madame was very
discreet.&quot; Marthe finished in a murmur.</p>

<p>&quot;So much the better. Now, help me to dress.
Quick, quick! Monsieur will be impatient.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. was ashamed of the innocence he had
displayed, and ashamed, too, of the whole Metropolitan
Police Force, admirable though it was in
stopping traffic for a perambulator to cross the
road. Five pounds! These ladies were bled. Five
pounds wanted earning.... It was a good sign,
though, that she had not so far asked him to
contribute. And he felt sure that she would not.</p>

<p>&quot;Come in, then, poltroon!&quot; She cooed softly
and encouragingly from the bedroom, where
Marthe was busy with her.</p>

<p>The door between the bedroom and the
drawing-room was open. G.J., humming, obeyed
the invitation and sat down on the bed between
two heaps of clothes. Christine was very gay;
she was like a child. She had apparently quite
forgotten her migraine and also the incident of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page97" id="page97">[97]</a></span>
the policeman. She snatched the cigarette from
G.J.'s mouth, took a puff, and put it back again.
Then she sat in front of the large mirror and did
her hair while Marthe buttoned her boots. Her
corset fitted beautifully, and as she raised her
arms above her head under the shaded lamp G.J.
could study the marvellous articulation of the arms
at the bare shoulders. The close atmosphere was
drenched with femininity. The two women, one so
stylish and the other by contrast piquantly a heavy
slattern, hid nothing whatever from him, bestowing
on him with perfect tranquillity the right to
be there and to watch at his ease every mysterious
transaction.... The most convincing proof that
Christine was authentically young! And G.J.
had the illusion again that he was in the Orient,
and it was extraordinarily agreeable. The recollection
of the scene of the Lechford Committee
amused him like a pantomime witnessed afar off
through a gauze curtain. It had no more reality
than that. But he thought better of the committee
now. He perceived the wonderful goodness
of it and of its work. It really was running
those real hospitals; it had a real interest in them.
He meant to do his very best in the accounts
department. After all, he had been a lawyer and
knew the routine of an office and the minutest
phenomena of a ledger. He was eager to begin.</p>

<p>&quot;How findest thou me?&quot;</p>

<p>She stood for inspection.</p>

<p>She was ready, except the gloves. The angle
of her hat, the provocation of her veil&mdash;these
things would have quickened the pulse of a
Patagonian. Perfume pervaded the room.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page98" id="page98">[98]</a></span>
<p>He gave the classic response that nothing could
render trite:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Tu es exquise</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>She raised her veil just above her mouth....</p>

<p>In the drawing-room she hesitated, and then
settled down on the piano-stool like a bird alighting
and played a few bars from the <i>Rosenkavalier</i>
waltz. He was thunderstruck, for she had got not
only the air but some of the accompaniment right.</p>

<p>&quot;Go on! Go on!&quot; he urged her, marvelling.</p>

<p>She turned, smiling, and shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;That is all that I can recall to myself.&quot;</p>

<p>The obvious sincerity of his appreciation
delighted her.</p>

<p>&quot;She is really musical!&quot; he thought, and was
convinced that while looking for a bit of coloured
glass he had picked up an emerald. Marthe
produced his overcoat, and when he was ready for
the street Christine gazed at him and said:</p>

<p>&quot;For the true <i>chic</i>, there are only Englishmen!&quot;</p>

<p>In the taxi she proved to him by delicate
effronteries the genuineness of her confessed
&quot;fancy&quot; for him. And she poured out slang.
He began to be afraid, for this excursion was an
experiment such as he had never tried before in
London; in Paris, of course, the code was otherwise.
But as soon as the commissionaire of the
restaurant at Victoria approached the door of the
taxi her manner changed. She walked up the
long interior with the demureness of a stockbroker's
young wife out for the evening from
Putney Hill. He thought, relieved, &quot;She is the
embodiment of common sense.&quot; At the end of
the vista of white tables the restaurant opened out
<span class="newpage"><a name="page99" id="page99">[99]</a></span>
to the left. In a far corner they were comfortably
secure from observation. They sat down. A
waiter beamed his flatteries upon them. G.J.
was serenely aware of his own skilled faculty for
ordering a dinner. He looked over the menu
card at Christine. Nobody could possibly tell that
she was a professed enemy of society. &quot;These
French women are astounding!&quot; he thought. He
intensely admired her. He was mad about her.
His bliss was extreme. He could not keep it
within bounds meet for the great world-catastrophe.
He was happy as for quite ten years he
had never hoped to be. Yes, he grieved for Concepcion;
but somehow grief could not mingle with
nor impair the happiness he felt. And was not
Concepcion lying in the affectionate arms of
Queenie Paulle?</p>

<p>Christine, glancing about her contentedly,
reverted to one of her leading ideas:</p>

<p>&quot;Truly, it is very romantic, thy London!&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page100" id="page100">[100]</a></span>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="Chapter_16"></a><h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<h4>THE VIRGIN</h4>
<br />

<p>Christine went into the oratory of St.
Philip at Brompton on a Sunday morning in the
following January, dipped her finger into one of
the Italian basins at the entrance, and signed
herself with the holy water. She was dressed in
black; she had the face of a pretty martyr; her
brow was crumpled by the world's sorrow; she
looked and actually was at the moment intensely
religious. She had months earlier chosen the
Brompton Oratory for her devotions, partly
because of the name of Philip, which had been
murmured in accents of affection by her dying
mother, and partly because it lay on a direct,
comprehensible bus-route from Piccadilly. You
got into the motor-bus opposite the end of the
Burlington Arcade, and in about six minutes it
dropped you in front of the Oratory; and you
could not possibly lose yourself in the topographical
intricacies of the unknown city. Christine
never took a taxi except when on business.</p>

<p>The interior was gloomy with the winter
forenoon; the broad Renaissance arches showed
themselves only faintly above; on every side there
were little archipelagos of light made by groups
of candles in front of great pale images. The church
<span class="newpage"><a name="page101" id="page101">[101]</a></span>
was comparatively empty, and most of the people
present were kneeling in the chapels; for Christine
had purposely come, as she always did, at the
slack hour between the seventh and last of the
early morning Low Masses and the High Mass at
eleven.</p>

<p>She went up the right aisle and stopped before
the Miraculous Infant Jesus of Prague, a charming
and naive little figure about eighteen inches
high in a stiff embroidered cloak and a huge
symbol upon his curly head. She had put herself
under the protection of the Miraculous Infant
Jesus of Prague. She liked him; he was a change
from the Virgin; and he stood in the darkest
corner of the whole interior, behind the black
statue of St. Peter with protruding toe, and within
the deep shadow made by the organ-loft overhead.
Also he had a motto in French: &quot;Plus vous
m'honorerez plus je vous favoriserai.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine hesitated, and then left the Miraculous
Infant Jesus of Prague without even a transient
genuflexion. She was afraid to devote herself to
him that morning.</p>

<p>Of course she had been brought up strictly in
the Roman Catholic faith. And in her own esteem
she was still an honest Catholic. For years she
had not confessed and therefore had not communicated.
For years she had had a desire to
cast herself down at a confessional-box, but she
had not done so because of one of the questions
in the <i>Petit Paroissien</i> which she used: &quot;Avez-vous
p&eacute;ch&eacute;, par pens&eacute;e, parole, ou action, contre
la puret&eacute; ou la modestie?&quot; And because also of
the preliminary injunction: &quot;Maintenant essayez
<span class="newpage"><a name="page102" id="page102">[102]</a></span>
de vous rappeler vos p&eacute;ch&eacute;s, <i>et combien de fois
vous les avez commis</i>.&quot; She could not bring herself
to do that. Once she had confessed a great deal
to a priest at Sens, but he had treated her too
lightly; his lightness with her had indeed been
shameful. Since then she had never confessed.
Further, she knew herself to be in a state of
mortal sin by reason of her frequent wilful
neglect of the holy offices; and occasionally, at the
most inconvenient moments, the conviction that
if she died she was damned would triumph over
her complacency. But on the whole she had
hopes for the future; though she had sinned, her
sin was mysteriously not like other people's sin
of exactly the same kind.</p>

<p>And finally there was the Virgin Mary, the
sweet and dependable goddess. She had been
neglecting the very clement Virgin Mary in favour
of the Miraculous Infant Jesus of Prague. A
whim, a thoughtless caprice, which she had paid
for! The Virgin Mary had withdrawn her
defending shield. At least that was the interpretation
which Christine was bound to put upon the
terrible incident of the previous night in the
Promenade. She had quite innocently been
involved in a drunken row in the lounge. Two
military officers, one of whom, unnoticed
by Christine, was intoxicated, and two
women&mdash;Madame Larivaudi&egrave;re and Christine! The
Belgian had been growing more and more
jealous of Christine.... The row had flamed up
in the tenth of a second like an explosion. The
two officers&mdash;then the two women. The bright
silvery sound of glass shattered on marble! High
<span class="newpage"><a name="page103" id="page103">[103]</a></span>
voices, deep voices! Half the Promenade had
rushed vulgarly into the lounge, panting with
a gross appetite to witness a vulgar scene. And
as the Belgian was jealous of the French girl, so
were the English girls horribly jealous of all the
foreign girls, and scornful too. Nothing but the
overwhelming desire of the management to maintain
the perfect respectability of its Promenade had
prevented a rough-and-tumble between the
officers. As for Madame Larivaudi&egrave;re, she had
been ejected and told never to return. Christine
had fled to the cloakroom, where she had
remained for half an hour, and thence had
vanished away, solitary, by the side entrance. It
was precisely such an episode as Christine's
mother would have deprecated in horror, and as
Christine herself intensely loathed. And she
could never assuage the moral wound of it by
confiding the affair to Gilbert. She was mad
about Gilbert; she thrilled to be his slave; she had
what seemed an immeasurable confidence in him;
and yet never, never could she mention another
individual man to him, much less tell him of the
public shame that had fallen upon her in the
exercise of her profession. Why had fate been thus
hard on her? The answer was surely to be found
in the displeasure of the Virgin. And so she did
not dare to stay with the Miraculous Infant Jesus
of Prague, nor even to murmur the prayer beginning:
&quot;Adorable J&eacute;sus, divin mod&egrave;le de la perfection ...&quot;</p>

<p>She glanced round the great church, considering
what were to her the major and minor gods
and goddesses on their ornate thrones: St. Antony,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page104" id="page104">[104]</a></span>
St. Joseph, St. Sebastian, St. Philip, the Sacred
Heart, St. Cecilia, St. Peter, St. Wilfrid, St.
Mary Magdelene (Ah! Not at that altar could
she be seen!), St. Patrick, St. Veronica, St.
Francis, St. John Baptist, St. Teresa, Our Lady,
Our Lady of Good Counsel. No! There was only
one goddess possible for her&mdash;Our Lady of VII
Dolours. She crossed the wide nave to the severe
black and white marble chapel of the VII
Dolours. The aspect of the shrine suited her. On
one side she read the English words: &quot;Of your
charity pray for the soul of Flora Duchess of
Norfolk who put up this altar to the Mother of
Sorrows that they who mourn may be comforted.&quot;
And the very words were romantic to
her, and she thought of Flora Duchess of Norfolk
as a figure inexpressibly more romantic than the
illustrious female figures of French history. The
Virgin of the VII Dolours was enigmatically
gazing at her, waiting no doubt to be placated.
The Virgin was painted, gigantic, in oil on canvas,
but on her breast stood out a heart made in three
dimensions of real silver and pierced by the
swords of the seven dolours, three to the left and
four to the right; and in front was a tiny gold
figure of Jesus crucified on a gold cross.</p>

<p>Christine cast herself down and prayed to the
painted image and the hammered heart. She
prayed to the goddess whom the Middle Ages had
perfected and who in the minds of the simple and
the savage has survived the Renaissance and still
triumphantly flourishes; the Queen of heaven, the
Tyrant of heaven, the Woman in heaven; who was
so venerated that even her sweat is exhibited as a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page105" id="page105">[105]</a></span>
relic; who was softer than Christ as Christ was
softer than the Father; who in becoming a goddess
had increased her humanity; who put living roses
for a sign into the mouths of fornicators when they
died, if only they had been faithful to her; who
told the amorous sacristan to kiss her face and not
her feet; who questioned lovers about their mistresses:
&quot;Is she as pretty as I?&quot;; who fell like a
pestilence on the nuptial chambers of young men
who, professing love for her, had taken another
bride; who enjoyed being amused; who admitted
a weakness for artists, tumblers, soldiers and the
common herd; who had visibly led both opponents
on every battlefield for centuries; who impersonated
absent disreputable nuns and did their
work for them until they returned, repentant, to
be forgiven by her; who acted always on her
instinct and never on her reason; who cared
nothing for legal principles; who openly used her
feminine influence with the Trinity; who filled
heaven with riff-raff; and who had never on any
pretext driven a soul out of heaven. Christine
made peace with this jealous and divine creature.
She felt unmistakably that she was forgiven for
her infidelity due to the Infant in the darkness
beyond the opposite aisle. The face of the Lady
of VII Dolours miraculously smiled at her; the
silver heart miraculously shed its tarnish and glittered
beneficent lightnings. Doubtless she knew
somewhere in her mind that no physical change
had occurred in the picture or the heart; but her
mind was a complex, and like nearly all minds
could disbelieve and believe simultaneously.</p>

<p>Just as High Mass was beginning she rose and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page106" id="page106">[106]</a></span>
in grave solace left the Oratory; she would not
endanger her new peace with the Virgin Mary
by any devotion to other gods. She was solemn
but happy. The conductor who took her penny
in the motor-bus never suspected that on the pane
before her, where some Agency had caused to be
printed in colour the words &quot;Seek ye the <i>Lord</i>&quot;
she saw, in addition to the amazing oddness of the
Anglo-Saxon race, a dangerous incitement to
unfaith. She kept her thoughts passionately on
the Virgin; and by the time the bus had reached
Hyde Park Corner she was utterly sure that the
horrible adventure of the Promenade was purged
of its evil potentialities.</p>

<p>In the house in Cork Street she took out her
latch-key, placidly opened the door, and entered,
smiling at the solitude. Marthe, who also had a
soul in need of succour, would, in the ordinary
course, have gone forth to a smaller church and a
late mass. But on this particular morning fat
Marthe, in d&eacute;shabille, came running to her from
the little kitchen.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Madame!... There is someone! He
is drunk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her voice was outraged. She pointed fearfully
to the bedroom. Christine, courageous, walked
straight in. An officer in khaki was lying on the
bed; his muddy, spurred boots had soiled the
white lace coverlet. He was asleep and snoring.
She looked at him, and, recognising her acquaintance
of the previous night, wondered what the
very clement Virgin could be about.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page107" id="page107">[107]</a></span>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="Chapter_17"></a><h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<h4>SUNDAY AFTERNOON</h4>
<br />

<p>&quot;What is Madame going to do?&quot; whispered
Marthe, still alarmed and shocked, when they had
both stepped back out of the bedroom; and she
added: &quot;He has never been here before.&quot;</p>

<p>Marthe was a woman of immense experience
but little brains, and when phenomena passed
beyond her experience she became rather like a
foolish, raw girl. She had often dealt with
drunken men; she had often&mdash;especially in her
younger days&mdash;satisfactorily explained a situation
to visitors who happened to call when her mistress
for the time being was out. But only on the
very rarest occasions had she known a client commit
the awful solecism of calling before lunch; and
that a newcomer, even intoxicated, should commit
this solecism staggered her and left her
trembling.</p>

<p>&quot;What am I going to do? Nothing!&quot; answered
Christine. &quot;Let him sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine, too, was dismayed. But Marthe's
weakness gave her strength, and she would not
show her fright. Moreover, Christine had some
force of character, though it did not often show
itself as sudden firmness. She condescended to
Marthe. She also condescended to the officer,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page108" id="page108">[108]</a></span>
because he was unconscious, because he had put
himself in a false position, because sooner or later
he would look extremely silly. She regarded the
officer's intrusion as tiresome, but she did not
gravely resent it. After all, he was drunk; and
before the row in the Promenade he had asked her
for her card, saying that he was engaged that night
but would like to know where she lived. Of course
she had protested&mdash;as what woman in her place
would not?&mdash;against the theory that he was
engaged that night, and she had been in a fair way
to convince him that he was not really engaged
that night&mdash;except morally to her, since he had
accosted her&mdash;when the quarrel had supervened
and it had dawned on her that he had been in the
taciturn and cautious stage of acute inebriety.</p>

<p>He had, it now seemed, probably been drinking
through the night. There were men, as she
knew, who simply had to have bouts, whose only
method to peace was to drown the demon within
them. She would never knowingly touch a
drunken man, or even a partially intoxicated man,
if she could help it. She was not a bit like the
polite young lady above, who seemed to specialise
in noisy tipplers. Her way with the top-heavy
was to leave them to recover in tranquillity.
No other way was safe. Nevertheless, in the
present instance she did venture again into the
bedroom. The plight of the lace coverlet troubled
her and practically drove her into the bedroom.
She got a little towel, gently lifted the sleeper's
left foot, and tied the towel round his boot; then
she did the same to his other foot. The man did
not stir; but if, later, he should stir, neither his
<span class="newpage"><a name="page109" id="page109">[109]</a></span>
boots nor his spurs could do further harm to the
lace coverlet. His cane and gloves were on the
floor; she picked them up. His overcoat,
apparently of excellent quality, was still on his
back; and the cap had not quite departed from
his head. Christine had learned enough about
English military signs and symbols to enable her
to perceive that he belonged to the artillery.</p>

<p>&quot;But how will madame change her dress?&quot;
Marthe demanded in the sitting-room. Madame
always changed her dress immediately on returning
from church, for that which is suitable for
mass may not be proper to other ends.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall not change,&quot; said Christine.</p>

<p>&quot;It is well, madame.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine was not deterred from changing by
the fact that the bedroom was occupied. She
retained her church dress because she foresaw the
great advantage she would derive from it in the
encounter which must ultimately occur with the
visitor. She would not even take her hat off.</p>

<p>The two women lunched, mainly on macaroni,
with some cheese and an apple. Christine had
coffee. Ah, she must always have her coffee.
As for a cigarette, she never smoked when alone,
because she did not really care for smoking.
Marthe, however, enjoyed smoking, and Christine
gave her a cigarette, which she lighted while
clearing the table. One was mistress, the other
servant, but the two women were constantly
meeting on the plane of equality. Neither of them
could avoid it, or consistently tried to avoid it.
Although Marthe did not eat with Christine, if a
meal was in progress she generally came into the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page110" id="page110">[110]</a></span>
sitting-room with her mouth more or less full of
food. Their repasts were trifles, passovers,
unceremonious and irregular peckings, begun and
finished in a few moments. And if Marthe was
always untidy in her person, Christine, up till
three in the afternoon, was also untidy. They
went about the flat in a wonderful state of unkempt
and insecure slovenliness. And sometimes
Marthe might be lolling in the sitting-room over
the illustrations in <i>La Vie Parisienne</i>, which was
part of the apparatus of the flat, while Christine
was in the tiny kitchen washing gloves as she
alone could wash them.</p>

<p>The flat lapsed into at any rate a superficial
calm. Marthe, seeing that fate had deprived her
of the usual consolations of religion, determined
to reward herself by remaining a perfect slattern
for the rest of the day. She would not change at
all. She would not wash up either the breakfast
things or the lunch things. Leaving a small ring
of gas alight in the gas stove, she sat down all
dirty on a hard chair in front of it and fell into a
luxurious catalepsy. In the sitting-room Christine
sat upright on the sofa and read lusciously a French
translation of <i>East Lynne</i>. She was in no hurry
for the man to waken; her sense of time was
very imperfect; she was never pricked by the
thought that life is short and that many urgent
things demand to be done before the grave opens.
Nor was she apprehensive of unpleasant complications.
The man was in the flat, but it was her flat;
her law ran in the flat; and the door was fast
against invasion. Still, the gentle snore of the
man, rising and falling, dominated the flat, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page111" id="page111">[111]</a></span>
the fact of his presence preoccupied the one
woman in the kitchen and the other in the sitting-room....</p>

<p>Christine noticed that the thickness of the pages
read had imperceptibly increased to three-quarters
of an inch, while the thickness of the unread pages
had diminished to a quarter of an inch. And she
also noticed, on the open page, another phenomenon.
It was the failing of the day&mdash;the faintest
shadow on the page. With incredible transience
another of those brief interruptions of darkness
which in London in winter are called days was
ending. She rose and went to the discreetly-curtained
window, and, conscious of the extreme
propriety of her appearance, boldly pulled aside
the curtain and looked across, through naked
glass, at the hotel nearly opposite. There was not
a sound, not a movement, in Cork Street. Cork
Street, the flat, the hotel, the city, the universe,
lay entranced and stupefied beneath the grey
vapours of the Sabbath. The sensation to Christine
was melancholy, but it was exquisitely melancholy.</p>

<p>The solid hotel dissolved, and in its place
Christine saw the interesting, pathetic phantom of
her own existence. A stern, serious existence,
full of disappointments, and not free from dangerous
episodes, an existence which entailed much
solitude and loss of liberty; but the verdict upon
it was that in the main it might easily have been
more unsatisfactory than it was. With her
indolence and her unappeasable temperament
what other vocation indeed, save that of marriage,
could she have taken up? And her temperament
would have rendered any marriage an impossible
<span class="newpage"><a name="page112" id="page112">[112]</a></span>
prison for her. She was a modest success&mdash;her
mother had always counselled her against
ambition&mdash;but she was a success. Her magic
power was at its height. She continued to save
money and had become a fairly regular frequenter
of the West End branch of the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais.
(Incidentally she had come to an arrangement
with her Paris landlord.)</p>

<p>But, more important than money, she was
saving her health, and especially her complexion&mdash;the
source of money. Her complexion could still
survive the minutest examination. She achieved
this supreme end by plenty of sleep and by keeping
to the minimum of alcohol. Of course she had to
drink professionally; clients insisted; some of them
were exhilarated by the spectacle of a girl tipsy;
but she was very ingenious in avoiding alcohol.
When invited to supper she would respond with
an air of restrained eagerness: &quot;Oh, yes, with
pleasure!&quot; And then carelessly add: &quot;Unless
you would prefer to come quietly home with me.
My maid is an excellent cook and one is very
comfortable <i>chez-moi</i>.&quot; And often the prospect
thus sketched would piquantly allure a client.
Nevertheless at intervals she could savour a
fashionable restaurant as well as any harum-scarum
minx there. Her secret fear was still
obesity. She was capable of imagining herself at
fat as Marthe&mdash;and ruined; for, though a few
peculiar amateurs appreciated solidity, the great
majority of men did not. However, she was not
getting stouter.</p>

<p>She had a secret sincere respect for certain of
her own qualities; and if women of the world
<span class="newpage"><a name="page113" id="page113">[113]</a></span>
condemned certain other qualities in her, well,
she despised women of the world&mdash;selfish idlers
who did nothing, who contributed nothing, to the
sum of life, whereas she was a useful and indispensable
member of society, despite her admitted
indolence. In this summary way she comforted
herself in her loss of caste.</p>

<p>Without Gilbert, of course, her existence would
have been fatally dull, and she might have been
driven to terrible remedies against ennui and
emptiness. The depth and violence of her feeling
for Gilbert were indescribable&mdash;at any rate by
her. She turned again from the darkening window
to the sofa and sat down and tried to recall the
figures of the dozens of men who had sat there,
and she could recall at most six or eight, and
Gilbert alone was real. What a paragon!... Her
scorn for girls who succumbed to <i>souteneurs</i>
was measureless; as a fact she had met few who
did.... She would have liked to beautify her
flat for Gilbert, but in the first place she did not
wish to spend money on it, in the second place she
was too indolent to buckle to the enterprise, and
in the third place if she beautified it she would be
doing so not for Gilbert, but for the monotonous
procession of her clients. Her flat was a public
resort, and so she would do nothing to it. Besides,
she did not care a fig about the look of furniture;
the feel of furniture alone interested her; she
wanted softness and warmth and no more.</p>

<p>She moved across to the piano, remembering
that she had not practised that day, and that she
had promised Gilbert to practise every day. He
was teaching her. At the beginning she had
<span class="newpage"><a name="page114" id="page114">[114]</a></span>
dreamt of acquiring brilliance such as his on the
piano, but she had soon seen the futility of the
dream and had moderated her hopes accordingly.
Even with terrific efforts she could not make her
hands do the things that his did quite easily at the
first attempt. She had, for example, abandoned
the <i>Rosenkavalier</i> waltz, having never succeeded in
struggling through more than about ten bars of
it, and those the simplest. But her French dances
she had notably improved in. She knew some of
them by heart and could patter them off with a
very tasteful vivacity. Instead of practising, she
now played gently through a slow waltz from
memory. If the snoring man was wakened, so
much the worse&mdash;or so much the better! She
went on playing, and evening continued to fall,
until she could scarcely see the notes. Then she
heard movements in the bedroom, a sigh, a
bump, some English words that she did not comprehend.
She still, by force of resolution, went on
playing, to protect herself, to give herself
countenance. At length she saw a dim male figure
against the pale oblong of the doorway between
the two rooms, and behind the figure a point of
glowing red in the stove.</p>

<p>&quot;I say&mdash;what time is it?&quot;</p>

<p>She recognised the heavy, resonant, vibrating
voice. She had stopped playing because she was
making so many mistakes.</p>

<p>&quot;Late&mdash;late!&quot; she murmured timidly.</p>

<p>The next moment the figure was kneeling at
her feet, and her left hand had been seized in a
hot hand and kissed&mdash;respectfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Forgive me, you beautiful creature!&quot; begged
<span class="newpage"><a name="page115" id="page115">[115]</a></span>
the deep, imploring voice. &quot;I know I don't
deserve it. But forgive me! I worship women,
honestly.&quot;</p>

<p>Assuredly she had not expected this development.
She thought: &quot;Is he not sober yet?&quot;
But the query had no conviction in it. She wanted
to believe that he was sober. At any rate he had
removed the absurd towels from his boots.</p>

<h4>THE MYSTIC</h4>
<br />

<p>&quot;Say you forgive me!&quot; The officer insisted.</p>

<p>&quot;But there is nothing&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say you forgive me!&quot;</p>

<p>She had counted on a scene of triumph with
him when he woke up, anticipating that he was
bound to cut a ridiculous appearance. He knelt
dimly there without a sign of self-consciousness
or false shame. She forgave him.</p>

<p>&quot;Great baby!&quot;</p>

<p>Her hand was kissed again and loosed. She
detected a faint, sad smile on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>He rose, towering above her.</p>

<p>&quot;I know I'm a drunken sot,&quot; he said. &quot;It
was only because I knew I was drunk that I didn't
want to come with you last night. And I called
this morning to apologise. I did really. I'd no
other thought in my poor old head. I wanted
you to understand why I tried to hit that chap.
The other woman had spoken to me earlier, and I
suppose she was jealous, seeing me with you.
She said something to him about you, and he
laughed, and I had to hit him for laughing. I
couldn't hit her. If I'd caught him an upper
cut with my left he'd have gone down, and he
<span class="newpage"><a name="page117" id="page117">[117]</a></span>
wouldn't have got up by himself&mdash;<i>I</i> warrant
you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did she say?&quot; Christine interrupted,
not comprehending the technical idiom and not
interested in it.</p>

<p>&quot;I dunno; but he laughed&mdash;anyhow he smiled.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine turned on the light, and then went
quickly to the window to draw the curtains.</p>

<p>&quot;Take off your overcoat,&quot; she commanded
him kindly.</p>

<p>He obeyed, blinking. She sat down on the
sofa and, raising her arms, drew the pins from
her hat and put it on the table. She motioned
him to sit down too, and left him a narrow space
between herself and the arm of the sofa, so that
they were very close together. Then, with
puckered brow, she examined him.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd better tell you,&quot; he said. &quot;It does me
good to confess to you, you beautiful thing. I
had a bottle of whisky upstairs in my room at
the Grosvenor. Night before last, when I arrived
there, I couldn't get to sleep in the bed. Hadn't
been used to a bed for so long, you know. I had
to turn out and roll myself up in a blanket on
the floor. And last night I spent drinking by
myself. Yes, by myself. Somehow, I don't
mind telling <i>you</i>. This morning I must have
been worse than I thought I was&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He stopped and put his hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;There are tears in your eyes, little thing.
Let me kiss your eyes.... No! I'll respect you.
I worship you. You're the nicest little woman I
ever saw, and I'm a brute. But let me kiss your
eyes.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page118" id="page118">[118]</a></span>
<p>She held her face seriously, even frowning
somewhat. And he kissed her eyes gently, one after
the other, and she smelt his contaminated breath.</p>

<p>He was a spare man, with a rather thin,
ingenuous, mysterious, romantic, appealing face.
It was true that her eyes had moistened. She was
touched by his look and his tone as he told her
that he had been obliged to lie on the floor of
his bedroom in order to sleep. There seemed to
be an infinite pathos in that trifle. He was one
of the fighters. He had fought. He was come
from the horrors of the battle. A man of power.
He had killed. And he was probably ten or a
dozen years her senior. Nevertheless, she felt herself
to be older than he was, wiser, more experienced.
She almost wanted to nurse him. And
for her he was, too, the protected of the very
clement Virgin. Inquiries from Marthe showed
that he must have entered the flat at the moment
when she was kneeling at the altar and when the
Lady of VII Dolours had miraculously granted
to her pardon and peace. He was part of the
miracle. She had a duty to him, and her duty
was to brighten his destiny, to give him joy, not
to let him go without a charming memory of her
soft womanly acquiescences. At the same time
her temperament was aroused by his personality;
and she did not forget she had a living to earn;
but still her chief concern was his satisfaction, not
her own, and her overmastering sentiment one of
dutiful, nay religious, surrender. French gratitude
of the English fighter, and a mystic, fearful
allegiance to the very clement Virgin&mdash;these
things inspired her.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page119" id="page119">[119]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he sighed. &quot;My throat's like leather.&quot;
And seeing that she did not follow, he added:
&quot;Thirsty.&quot; He stretched his arms. She went to
the sideboard and half filled a tumbler with soda
water from the siphon.</p>

<p>&quot;Drink!&quot; she said, as if to a child.</p>

<p>&quot;Just a dash! The tiniest dash!&quot; he pleaded
in his rich voice, with a glance at the whisky.
&quot;You don't know how it'll pull me together. You
don't know how I need it.&quot;</p>

<p>But she did know, and she humoured him,
shaking her head disapprovingly.</p>

<p>He drank and smacked his lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he breathed voluptuously, and then
said in changed, playful accents: &quot;Your French
accent is exquisite. It makes English sound
quite beautiful. And you're the daintiest little
thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Daintiest? What is that? I have much to
learn in English. But it is something
nice&mdash;daintiest; it is a compliment.&quot; She somehow
understood then that, despite appearances, he was
not really a devotee of her sex, that he was really
a solitary, that he would never die of love, and
that her <i>r&ocirc;le</i> was a minor <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in his existence.
And she accepted the fact with humility, with
enthusiasm, with ardour, quite ready to please and
to be forgotten. In playing the slave to him she
had the fierce French illusion of killing Germans.</p>

<p>Suddenly she noticed that he was wearing two
wrist-watches, one close to the other, on his left
arm, and she remarked on the strange fact.</p>

<p>The officer's face changed.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you got a wrist-watch?&quot; he demanded.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page120" id="page120">[120]</a></span>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>Silently he unfastened one of the watches and
then said:</p>

<p>&quot;Hold out your beautiful arm.&quot;</p>

<p>She did so. He fastened the watch on her arm.
She was surprised to see that it was a lady's watch.
The black strap was deeply scratched. She
privately reconstructed the history of the watch,
and decided that it must be a gift returned after
a quarrel&mdash;and perhaps the scratches on the strap
had something to do with the quarrel.</p>

<p>&quot;I beg you to accept it,&quot; he said. &quot;I particularly
wish you to accept it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's really a lovely watch,&quot; she exclaimed.
&quot;How kind you are!&quot; She rewarded him with
a warm kiss. &quot;I have always wanted a wristwatch.
And now they are so <i>chic</i>. In fact, one
must have one.&quot; Moving her arm about, she
admired the watch at different angles.</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't going. And what's more, it won't
go,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; she politely murmured.</p>

<p>&quot;No! But do you know why I give you that
watch?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because it is a mascot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Absolutely a mascot. It belonged to a friend
of mine who is dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! A lady&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! Not a lady. A man. He gave it me a
few minutes before he died&mdash;and he was wearing
it&mdash;and he told me to take it off his arm as soon
as he was dead. I did so.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page121" id="page121">[121]</a></span>
<p>Christine was somewhat alarmed.</p>

<p>&quot;But if he was wearing it when he died, how
can it be a mascot?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was what made it a mascot. Believe
me, I know about these things. I wouldn't
deceive you, and I wouldn't tell you it was a
mascot unless I was quite certain.&quot; He spoke
with a quiet, initiated authority that reassured her
entirely and gave her the most perfect confidence.</p>

<p>&quot;And why was your friend wearing a lady's
watch?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do not know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know. But I know that watch is a
mascot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was it at the Front&mdash;all this?&quot;</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;He was wounded, killed, your friend?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, not wounded! He was in my Battery.
We were galloping some guns to a new position.
He came off his horse&mdash;the horse was shot under
him&mdash;he himself fell in front of a gun. Of course,
the drivers dared not stop, and there was no room
to swerve. Hence they had to drive right over
him ... Later, I came back to him. They had got him
as far as the advanced dressing-station. He died
in less than an hour....&quot;</p>

<p>Solemnity fell between Christine and her client.</p>

<p>She said softly: &quot;But if it is a mascot&mdash;do you
not need it, you, at the Front? It is wrong for me
to take it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have my own mascot. Nothing can touch
me&mdash;except my great enemy, and he is not
German.&quot; With an austere gesture he indicated
<span class="newpage"><a name="page122" id="page122">[122]</a></span>
the glass. His deep voice was sad, but very firm.
Christine felt that she was in the presence of an
adept of mysticism. The Virgin had sent this man
to her, and the man had given her the watch.
Clearly the heavenly power had her in its holy
charge.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes!&quot; said the man in a new tone, as if
realising the solemnity and its inappropriateness,
and trying to dissipate it. &quot;Ah, yes! Once we
had the day of our lives together, he and I. We
got a day off to go and see a new trench mortar,
and we did have a time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trench mortar&mdash;what is that?&quot;</p>

<p>He explained.</p>

<p>&quot;But tell me how it works,&quot; she insisted, not
because she had the slightest genuine interest in
the technical details of war&mdash;for she had not&mdash;but
because she desired to help him to change the
mood of the scene.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's not so easy, you know. It was a
four and a half pound shell, filled with gun-cotton
slabs and shrapnel bullets packed in sawdust.
The charge was black powder in a paper bag,
and you stuck it at the bottom end of the pipe and
put a bit of fuse into the touch-hole&mdash;but, of
course, you must take care it penetrates the charge.
The shell-fuse has a pinner with a detonator
with the right length of fuse shoved into it; you
wrap some clay round the end of the fuse to stop
the flash of the charge from detonating the shell.
Well, then you load the shell&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She comprehended simply nothing, and the
man, professionally absorbed, seemed to have no
perception that she was comprehending nothing.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page123" id="page123">[123]</a></span>
She scarcely even listened. Her face was set in
a courteous, formal smile; but all the time she
was thinking that the man, in spite of his qualities,
must be lacking in character to give a watch
away to a woman to whom he had not been talking
for ten minutes. His lack of character was shown
also in his unshamed confession concerning his
real enemy. Some men would bare their souls
to a <i>cocotte</i> in a fashion that was flattering neither
to themselves nor to the <i>cocotte</i>, and Christine
never really respected such men. She did not
really respect this man, but respected, and stood
in awe of, his mysticism; and, further, her instinct
to satisfy him, to make a spoiled boy of him, was
not in the least weakened. Then, just as the man
was in the middle of his description of the functioning
of the trench mortar, the telephone-bell
rang, and Christine excused herself.</p>

<p>The telephone was in the bedroom, not by
the bedside&mdash;for such a situation had its
inconveniences&mdash;but in the farthest corner, between
the window and the washstand. As she went to the
telephone she was preoccupied by one of the major
worries of her vocation, the worry of keeping
clients out of each other's sight. She wondered
who could be telephoning to her on Sunday
evening. Not Gilbert, for Gilbert never telephoned
on Sunday except in the morning. She
insisted, of course, on his telephoning to her
daily, or almost daily. She did this to several of
her more reliable friends, for there was no surer
way of convincing them of the genuineness of
her regard for them than to vituperate them when
they failed to keep her informed of their health,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page124" id="page124">[124]</a></span>
their spirits, and their doings. In the case of
Gilbert, however, her insistence had entirely
ceased to be a professional device; she adored
him violently.</p>

<p>The telephoner was Gilbert. He made an
amazing suggestion; he asked her to come across
to his flat, where she had never been and where he
had never asked her to go. It had been tacitly and
quite amiably understood between them that he
was not one who invited young ladies to his own
apartments.</p>

<p>Christine cautiously answered that she was not
sure whether she could come.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you alone?&quot; he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, quite.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I will come and fetch you.&quot;</p>

<p>She decided exactly what she would do.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no. I will come. I will come now. I
shall be enchanted.&quot; Purposely she spoke without
conviction, maintaining a mysterious reserve.</p>

<p>She returned to the sitting-room and the other
man. Fortunately the conversation on the
telephone had been in French.</p>

<p>&quot;See!&quot; she said, speaking and feeling as though
they were intimates. &quot;I have a lady friend who is
ill. I am called to see her. I shall not be long.
I swear to you I shall not be long. Wait. Will
you wait?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, gazing at her.</p>

<p>&quot;Put yourself at your ease.&quot;</p>

<p>She was relieved to find that she could so easily
reconcile her desire to please Gilbert with her
pleasurable duty towards the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the very
clement Virgin.</p>

<h4>THE VISIT</h4>
<br />

<p>In the doorway of his flat Christine kissed
G.J. vehemently, but with a certain preoccupation;
she was looking about her, very curious.
The way in which she raised her veil and raised
her face, mysteriously glanced at him, puckered
her kind brow&mdash;these things thrilled him.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>&quot;You are quite alone, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>She said it nicely, even benevolently; nevertheless
he seemed to hear her saying: &quot;You are
quite alone, or, of course, you wouldn't have let
me come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose it's through here,&quot; she murmured;
and without waiting for an invitation she passed
direct into the lighted drawing-room and stood
there, observant.</p>

<p>He followed her. They were both nervous in
the midst of the interior which he was showing her
for the first time, and which she was silently
estimating. For him she made an exquisite figure
in the drawing-room. She was so correct in her
church-dress, so modest, prim and demure. And
her appearance clashed excitingly with his
absolute knowledge of her secret temperament.
He had often hesitated in his judgment of her.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page126" id="page126">[126]</a></span>
Was she good enough or was she not? But now
he thought more highly of her than ever. She
was ideal, divine, the realisation of a dream. And
he felt extraordinarily pleased with himself
because, after much cautious indecision, he had
invited her to visit him. By heaven, she was
young physically, and yet she knew everything!
Her miraculous youthfulness rejuvenated him.</p>

<p>As a fact he was essentially younger than he
had been for years. Not only she, but his war
work, had re-vitalised him. He had developed
into a considerable personage on the Lechford
Committee; he was chairman of a sub-committee;
he bore responsibilities and had worries. And for
a climax the committee had sent him out to
France to report on the accountancy of the
hospitals; he had received a special passport;
he had had glimpses of the immense and growing
military organisation behind the Front; he had
chatted in his fluent and idiomatic French with
authorities military and civil; he had been
ceremoniously complimented on behalf of his
committee and country by high officials of the
Service de Sant&eacute;. A wondrous experience, from
which he had returned to England with a greatly
increased self-respect and a sharper apprehension
of the significance of the war.</p>

<p>Life in London was proceeding much as usual.
If on the one hand the Treasury had startlingly
put an embargo upon capital issues, on the other
hand the King had resumed his patronage of the
theatre, and the town talked of a new Lady Teazle,
and a British dye-industry had been inaugurated.
But behind the thin gauze of social phenomena
<span class="newpage"><a name="page127" id="page127">[127]</a></span>
G.J. now more and more realistically perceived
and conceived the dark shape of the war as a vast
moving entity. He kept concurrently in his mind,
each in its place, the most diverse factors and
events: not merely the Flemish and the French
battles, but the hoped-for intervention of Roumania,
the defeat of the Austrians by Servia, the
menace of a new Austrian attack on Servia, the
rise in prices, the Russian move north of the
Vistula, the raid on Yarmouth, the divulgence
of the German axioms about frightfulness, the
rumour of a definite German submarine policy,
the terrible storm that had disorganised the entire
English railway-system, and the dim distant Italian
earthquake whose death-roll of thousands had produced
no emotion whatever on a globe monopolised
by one sole interest.</p>

<p>And to-night he had had private early telephonic
information of a naval victory in the North
Sea in which big German cruisers had been chased
to their ignominious lairs and one sunk. Christine
could not possibly know of this grand affair, for
the Sunday night extras were not yet on the
streets; he had it ready for her, eagerly waiting
to pour it into her delicious lap along with the
inexhaustible treasures of his heart. At that
moment he envisaged the victory as a shining
jewel specially created in order to give her a throb
of joy.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems they picked up a lot of survivors
from the <i>Blucher</i>,&quot; he finished his narration,
rather proudly.</p>

<p>She retorted, quietly but terribly scornful:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Zut</i>! You English are so naive. Why save
<span class="newpage"><a name="page128" id="page128">[128]</a></span>
them? Why not let them drown? Do they not
deserve to drown? Look what they have done,
those Boches! And you save them! Why did
the German ships run away? They had set a
trap&mdash;that sees itself&mdash;in addition to being
cowards. You save them, and you think you have
made a fine gesture; but you are nothing but
simpletons.&quot; She shrugged her shoulders in
inarticulate disdain.</p>

<p>Christine's attitude towards the war was
uncomplicated by any subtleties. Disregarding all
but the utmost spectacular military events, she
devoted her whole soul to hatred of the Germans&mdash;and
all the Germans. She believed them to be
damnably cleverer than any other people on
earth, and especially than the English. She
believed them to be capable of all villainies whatsoever.
She believed every charge brought against
them, never troubling about evidence. She would
have imprisoned on bread and water all Germans
and all persons with German names in England.
She was really shocked by the transparent idiocy
of Britons who opposed the retirement of Prince
Louis of Battenberg from the Navy. For weeks
she had remained happily in the delusion that
Prince Louis had been shot in the Tower, and
when the awakening came she had instantly
decided that the sinister influence of Lord
Haldane and naught else must have saved Prince
Louis from a just retribution. She had a vision of
England as overrun with innumerable German
spies who moved freely at inexpressible speed
about the country in high-powered grey automobiles
with dazzling headlights, while the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page129" id="page129">[129]</a></span>
marvellously stupid and blind British police
touched their hats to them. G.J. smiled at her
in silence, aware by experience of the futility of
argument. He knew quite a lot of women who
had almost precisely Christine's attitude towards
the war, and quite a lot of men too. But he could
have wished the charming creature to be as desirable
for her intelligence as for her physical and
her strange spiritual charm: he could have wished
her not to be providing yet another specimen of
the phenomena of woman repeating herself so
monotonously in the various worlds of London.
The simpleton of fifty made in his soul an effort
to be superior, and failed. &quot;What is it that binds
me to her?&quot; he reflected, imagining himself to be
on the edge of a divine mystery, and never
expecting that he and Christine were the huge
contrivances of certain active spermatozoa for
producing other active spermatozoa.</p>

<p>Christine did not wonder what bound her to
G.J. She knew, though she had never heard such
a word as spermatozoa. She had a violent passion
for him; it would, she feared, be eternal, whereas
his passion for her could not last more than a few
years. She knew what the passions of men were&mdash;so
she said to herself superiorly. Her passion
for him was in her smile as she smiled back at his
silent smile; but in her smile there was also a
convinced apostleship&mdash;for she alone was the
repository of the truth concerning Germans, which
truth she preached to an unheeding world. And
there was something else in her baffling smile,
namely, a quiet, good-natured, resigned resentment
against the richness of his home. He had
<span class="newpage"><a name="page130" id="page130">[130]</a></span>
treated her always with generosity, and at any
rate with rather more than fairness; he had not
attempted to conceal that he was a man of means;
she had nothing to reproach him with financially.
And yet she did reproach him&mdash;for having been
too modest. She had a pretty sure instinct for
the price of things, and she knew that this Albany
interior must have been very costly; further, it
displayed what she deemed to be the taste of an
exclusive aristocrat. She saw that she had been
undervaluing her Gilbert. The proprietor of this
flat would be entitled to seek relations of higher
standing than herself in the ranks of <i>cocotterie</i>;
he would be justified in spending far more money
on a girl than he had spent on her. He was
indeed something of a fraud with his exaggerated
English horror of parade. And he lived by
himself, save for servants; he was utterly free;
and yet for two months he had kept her out of
these splendours, prevented her from basking in
the glow of these chandeliers and lounging on these
extraordinary sofas and beholding herself in these
terrific mirrors. Even now he was ashamed to
let his servants see her. Was it altogether nice of
him? Her verdict on him had not the slightest
importance&mdash;even for herself. In kissing other
men she generally kissed him&mdash;to cheat her
appetite. She was at his mercy, whatever he was.
He was useful to her and kind to her; he might be
the fount of very important future advantages; but
he was more than that, he was indispensable to her.
She walked exploringly into the little glittering
bedroom. Beneath the fantastic dome of the
bed the sheets were turned down and a suit of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page131" id="page131">[131]</a></span>
pyjamas laid out. On a Chinese tray on a
lacquered table by the bed was a spirit-lamp and
kettle, and a box of matches in an embroidered
case with one match sticking out ready to be
seized and struck. She gazed, and left the bedroom,
saying nothing, and wandered elsewhere.
The stairs were so infinitesimal and dear and
delicious that they drew from her a sharp exclamation
of delight. She ran up them like a child.
G.J. turned switches. In the little glittering
dining-room a little cold repast was laid for two
on an inlaid table covered with a sheet of glass.
Christine gazed, saying nothing, and wandered
again to the drawing-room floor, while G.J.
hovered attendant. She went to the vast Regency
desk, idly fingering papers, and laid hold of a
document. It was his report on the accountacy
of the Lechford Hospitals in France. She
scrutinised it carefully, murmuring sentences from
it aloud in her French accent. At length she
dropped it; she did not put it down, she dropped
it, and murmured:</p>

<p>&quot;All that&mdash;what good does it do to wounded
men?... True, I comprehend nothing of it&mdash;I!&quot;</p>

<p>Then she sat to the piano, whose gorgeous and
fantastic case might well have intimidated even a
professional musician.</p>

<p>&quot;Dare I?&quot; She took off her gloves.</p>

<p>As she began to play her best waltz she looked
round at G.J. and said:</p>

<p>&quot;I adore thy staircase.&quot;</p>

<p>And that was all she did say about the flat.
Still, her demeanour, mystifying as it might be,
was benign, benevolent, with a remarkable
<span class="newpage"><a name="page132" id="page132">[132]</a></span>
appearance of genuine humility.</p>

<p>G.J., while she played, discreetly picked up
the telephone and got the Marlborough Club. He
spoke low, so as not to disturb the waltz, which
Christine in her nervousness was stumbling over.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to speak to Mr. Montague Ryper.
Yes, yes; he is in the club. I spoke to him about
an hour ago, and he is waiting for me to ring
him up.... That you, Monty? Well, dear
heart, I find I shan't be able to come to-night
after all. I should like to awfully, but I've got
these things I absolutely must finish.... You
understand.... No, no.... Is she, by Jove?
By-bye, old thing.&quot;</p>

<p>When Christine had pettishly banged the last
chord of the coda, he came close to her and said,
with an appreciative smile, in English:</p>

<p>&quot;Charming, my little girl.&quot;</p>

<p>She shook her head, gazing at the front of the
piano.</p>

<p>He murmured&mdash;it was almost a whisper:</p>

<p>&quot;Take your things off.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked round and up at him, and the light
diffused from a thousand lustres fell on her
mysterious and absorbed face.</p>

<p>&quot;My little rabbit, I cannot stay with thee
to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>The words, though he did not by any means
take them as final, seriously shocked him. For
five days he had known that Mrs. Braiding, subject
to his convenience, was going down to Bramshott
to see the defender of the Empire. For four days
he had hesitated whether or not he should tell her
that she might stay away for the night. In the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page133" id="page133">[133]</a></span>
end he had told her to stay away; he had insisted
that she should stay; he had protested that he was
quite ready to look after himself for a night and
a morning. She had gone, unwillingly, having
first arranged a meal which he said he was to
share with a friend&mdash;naturally, for Mrs. Braiding,
a male friend. She had wanted him to dine at the
club, but he had explained to Mrs. Braiding that
he would be busy upon hospital work, and that
another member of the committee would be
coming to help him&mdash;the friend, of course. Even
when he had contrived this elaborate and perfect
plot he had still hesitated about the bold step of
inviting Christine to the flat. The plan was
extremely attractive, but it held dangers. Well,
he had invited her. If she had not been at home,
or if she had been unwilling to come, he would
not have felt desolated; he would have accepted
the fact as perhaps providential. But she was at
home; she was willing; she had come. She was
with him; she had put him into an ecstasy of
satisfaction and anticipation. One evening alone
with her in his own beautiful flat! What a frame
for her and for love! And now she said that she
would not stay. It was incredible; it could not be
permitted.</p>

<p>&quot;But why not? We are happy together. I
have just refused a dinner because of&mdash;this.
Didn't you hear me on the 'phone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thou wast wrong,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I am not
worth a dinner. It is essential that I should return
home. I am tired&mdash;tired. It is Sunday night, and
I have sworn to myself that I will pass this evening
at home&mdash;alone.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page134" id="page134">[134]</a></span>
<p>Exasperating, maddening creature! He thought:
&quot;I fancied I knew her, and I don't know her.
I'm only just beginning to know her.&quot; He stared
steadily at her soft, serious, worried, enchanting
face, and tried to see through it into the arcana
of her queer little brain. He could not. The
sweet face foiled him.</p>

<p>&quot;Then why come?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I wished to be nice to thee, to prove
to thee how nice I am.&quot;</p>

<p>She seized her gloves. He saw that she meant
to go. His demeanour changed. He was aware
of his power over her, and he would use it. She
was being subtle; but he could be subtle too, far
subtler than Christine. True, he had not penetrated
her face. Nevertheless his instinct, and his
male gift of ratiocination, informed him that
beneath her gentle politeness she was vexed, hurt,
because he had got rid of Mrs. Braiding before
receiving her. She had her feelings, and despite
her softness she could resent. Still, her feelings
must not be over-indulged; they must not be
permitted to make a fool of her. He said, rather
teasingly, but firmly:</p>

<p>&quot;I know why she refuses to stay.&quot;</p>

<p>She cried, plaintive:</p>

<p>&quot;It is not that I have another rendezvous. No!
But naturally thou thinkest it is that.&quot;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. The little silly wants to go back
home because she finds there is no servant here.
She is insulted in her pride. I noticed it in her
first words when she came in. And yet she ought
to know&mdash;&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page135" id="page135">[135]</a></span>
<p>Christine gave a loud laugh that really disconcerted
him.</p>

<p>&quot;Au revoir, my old one. Embrace me.&quot; She
dropped the veil.</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot;</p>

<p>He could play a game of pretence longer than
she could. She moved with dignity towards the
door, but never would she depart like that. He
knew that when it came to the point she was at
the mercy of her passion for him. She had confessed
the tyranny of her passion, as such victims
foolishly will. Moreover he had perceived it for
himself. He followed her to the door. At the door
she would relent. And, sure enough, at the door
she leapt at him and clasped his neck with fierceness
and fiercely kissed him through her veil, and
exclaimed bitterly:</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! Thou dost not love me, but I love thee!&quot;</p>

<p>But the next instant she had managed to open
the door and she was gone.</p>

<p>He sprang out to the landing. She was running
down the stone stairs.</p>

<p>&quot;Christine!&quot;</p>

<p>She did not stop. G.J. might be marvellously
subtle; but he could not be subtle enough to
divine that on that night Christine happened to
be the devotee of the most clement Virgin, and
that her demeanour throughout the visit had been
contrived, half unconsciously, to enable her to
perform a deed of superb self-denial and renunciation
in the service of the dread goddess. He ate
most miserably alone, facing an empty chair; the
desolate solitude of the evening was terrible; he
lacked the force to go seeking succour in clubs.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page136" id="page136">[136]</a></span>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="Chapter_20"></a><h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<h4>MASCOT</h4>
<br />

<p>A single light burned in Christine's bedroom.
It stood low on the pedestal by the wide bed
and was heavily shaded, so that only one half of
the bed, Christine's half, was exempt from the
general gloom of the chamber. The officer had
thus ordained things. The white, plump arm of
Christine was imprisoned under his neck. He
had ordered that too. He was asleep. Christine
watched him. On her return from the Albany
she had found him apparently just as she had left
him, except that he was much less talkative.
Indeed, though unswervingly polite&mdash;even punctilious
with her&mdash;he had grown quite taciturn and
very obstinate and finicking in self-assertion.
There was no detail as to which he did not
formulate a definite wish. Yet not until by chance
her eye fell on the whisky decanter did she perceive
that in her absence he had been copiously
drinking again. He was not, however, drunk.
Remorseful at her defection, she constituted herself
his slave; she covered him with acquiescences; she
drank his tippler's breath. And he was not particularly
responsive. He had all his own ideas.
He ought, for example, to have been hungry, but
his idea was that he was not hungry; therefore he
had refused her dishes.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page137" id="page137">[137]</a></span>
<p>She knew him better now. Save on one subject,
discussed in the afternoon, he was a dull,
narrow, direct man, especially in love. He had
no fancy, no humour, no resilience. Possibly he
worshipped women, as he had said, perhaps
devoutly; but his worship of the individual girl
tended more to ritualism than to ecstasy. The
Parisian devotee was thrown away on him, and
she felt it. But not with bitterness. On the
contrary, she liked him to be as he was; she liked
to be herself unappreciated, neglected, bored.
She thought of the delights which she had
renounced in the rich and voluptuous drawing-room
of the Albany; she gazed under the reddish
illumination at the tedious eternal market-place
on which she exposed her wares, and which in
Tottenham Court Road went by the name of bedstead;
and she gathered nausea and painful
longing to her breast as the Virgin gathered the
swords of the Dolours at the Oratory, and was
mystically happy in the ennui of serving the
miraculous envoy of the Virgin. And when
Marthe, uneasy, stole into the sitting-room,
Christine, the door being ajar, most faintly transmitted
to her a command in French to tranquillise
herself and go away. And outside a boy broke
the vast lull of the Sunday night with a shattering
cry of victory in the North Sea.</p>

<p>Possibly it was this cry that roused the officer
out of his doze. He sat up, looked unseeing at
Christine's bright smile and at the black gauze
that revealed the reality of her youth, and then
reached for his tunic which hung at the foot of
the bed.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page138" id="page138">[138]</a></span>
<p>&quot;You asked about my mascot,&quot; he said, drawing
from a pocket a small envelope of semi-transparent
oilskin. &quot;Here it is. Now that is a
mascot!&quot;</p>

<p>He had wakened under the spell of his original
theme, of his sole genuine subject. He spoke with
assurance, as one inspired. His eyes, as they
masterfully encountered Christine's eyes, had a
strange, violent, religious expression. Christine's
eyes yielded to his, and her smile vanished
in seriousness. He undid the envelope and
displayed an oval piece of red cloth with a picture
of Christ, his bleeding heart surrounded
by flames and thorns and a great cross in the
background.</p>

<p>&quot;That,&quot; said the officer, &quot;will bring anybody
safe home again.&quot; Christine was too awed even
to touch the red cloth. The vision of the
dishevelled, inspired man in khaki shirt, collar and
tie, holding the magic saviour in his thin, veined,
aristocratic hand, powerfully impressed her, and
she neither moved nor spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you seen the 'Touchwood' mascot?&quot;
he asked. She signified a negative, and then
nervously fingered her gauze. &quot;No? It's a well-known
mascot. Sort of tiny imp sort of thing,
with a huge head, glittering eyes, a khaki cap of
<i>oak</i>, and crossed legs in gold and silver. I hear
that tens of thousands of them are sold. But
there is nothing like my mascot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where have you got it?&quot; Christine asked
in her queer but improving English.</p>

<p>&quot;Where did I get it? Just after Mons, on the
road, in a house.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page139" id="page139">[139]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Have you been in the retreat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the angels? Have you seen them?&quot;</p>

<p>He paused, and then said with solemnity:</p>

<p>&quot;Was it an angel I saw?... I was lying doggo
by myself in a hole, and bullets whizzing over
me all the time. It was nearly dark, and a figure
in white came and stood by the hole; he stood
quite still and the German bullets went on just
the same. Suddenly I saw he was wounded in
the hand; it was bleeding. I said to him: 'You're
hit in the hand.' 'No,' he said&mdash;he had a most
beautiful voice&mdash;'that is an old wound. It has
reopened lately. I have another wound in the
other hand.' And he showed me the other hand,
and that was bleeding too. Then the firing ceased,
and he pointed, and although I'd eaten nothing
at all that day and was dead-beat, I got up and
ran the way he pointed, and in five minutes I ran
into what remained of my unit.&quot;</p>

<p>The officer's sonorous tones ceased; he shut
his lips tightly, as though clinching the testimony,
and the life of the bedroom was suspended in
absolute silence.</p>

<p>&quot;That's what <i>I</i> saw.... And with the lack
of food my brain was absolutely clear.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine, on her back, trembled.</p>

<p>The officer replaced his mascot. Then he said,
waving the little bag:</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, there are fellows who don't need
mascots. Fellows that if their name isn't written
on a bullet or a piece of shrapnel it won't reach
them any more than a letter not addressed to you
would reach you. Now my Colonel, for instance&mdash;it
<span class="newpage"><a name="page140" id="page140">[140]</a></span>
was he who told me how good my mascot was&mdash;well,
he can stop shells, turn 'em back. Yes.
He's just got the D.S.O. And he said to me,
'Edgar,' he said, 'I don't deserve it. I got it by
inspiration.' And so he did.... What time's
that?&quot;</p>

<p>The gilded Swiss clock in the drawing-room
was striking its tiny gong.</p>

<p>&quot;Nine o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p>The officer looked dully at his wrist-watch
which, not having been wound on the previous
night, had inconsiderately stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I can't catch my train at Victoria.&quot; He
spoke in a changed voice, lifeless, and sank back
on the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Train? What train?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing. Only the leave train. My leave
is up to-night. To-morrow I ought to have been
back in the trenches.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you have told me nothing of it! If you
had told me&mdash;But not one word, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When one is with a woman&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p>He seemed gloomily and hopelessly to reproach
her.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page141" id="page141">[141]</a></span>

<a name="Chapter_21"></a><h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<h4>THE LEAVE-TRAIN</h4>
<br />

<p>&quot;What o'clock&mdash;your train?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nine-thirty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you can catch it. You must catch it.&quot;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &quot;It's fate,&quot; he muttered,
bitterly resigned. &quot;What is written is written.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine sprang to the floor, shuffled off the
black gauze in almost a single movement, and
seized some of her clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;Quick! You shall catch your train. The
clock is wrong&mdash;the clock is too soon.&quot;</p>

<p>She implored him with positive desperation.
She shook him and dragged him, energised in an
instant by the overwhelming idea that for him to
miss his train would be fatal to him&mdash;and to her
also. She could and did believe in the efficacy
of mascots against bullets and shrapnel and
bayonets. But the traditions of a country of conscripts
were ingrained in her childhood and youth,
and she had not the slightest faith in the efficacy
of no matter what mascot to protect from the
consequences of indiscipline. And already during
her short career in London she had had good
reason to learn the sacredness of the leave-train.
Fantastic tales she had heard of capital executions
for what seemed trifling laxities&mdash;tales whispered
<span class="newpage"><a name="page142" id="page142">[142]</a></span>
half proudly by the army in the rooms of horrified
courtesans&mdash;tales in which the remote and ruthless
imagined figure of the Grand Provost-Marshal
rivalled that of God himself. And, moreover, if
this man fell into misfortune through her, she
would eternally lose the grace of the most clement
Virgin who had confided him to her and who was
capable of terrible revenges. She secretly called
on the Virgin. Nay, she became the Virgin. She
found a miraculous strength, and furiously pulled
the poor sot out of bed. The fibres of his character
had been soaked away, and she mystically
replaced them with her own. Intimidated and, as
it were, mesmerised, he began to dress. She
rushed as she was to the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Marthe! Marthe!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Madame?&quot; replied the fat woman in alarm.</p>

<p>&quot;Run for a taxi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, madame, it is raining terribly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Je m'en fous</i>! Run for a taxi.&quot;</p>

<p>Turning back into the room she repeated;
&quot;The clock is too soon.&quot; But she knew that it
was not. Nearly nude, she put on a hat.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Do not worry. I come with you.&quot;</p>

<p>She took a skirt and a jersey and then threw
a cloak over everything. He was very slow; he
could find nothing; he could button nothing. She
helped him. But when he began to finger his
leggings with the endless laces and the innumerable
eyelets she snatched them from him.</p>

<p>&quot;Those&mdash;in the taxi,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;But there is no taxi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There will be a taxi. I have sent the maid.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page143" id="page143">[143]</a></span>
<p>At the last moment, as she was hurrying him
on to the staircase, she grasped her handbag.
They stumbled one after the other down the dark
stairs. He had now caught the infection of her
tremendous anxiety. She opened the front door.
The glistening street was absolutely empty; the
rain pelted on the pavements and the roadway,
each drop falling like a missile and raising a
separate splash, so that it seemed as if the flood
on the earth was leaping up to meet the flood from
the sky.</p>

<p>&quot;Come!&quot; she said with hysterical impatience.
&quot;We cannot wait. There will be a taxi in Piccadilly,
I know.&quot;</p>

<p>Simultaneously a taxi swerved round the corner
of Burlington Street. Marthe stood on the step
next to the driver. As the taxi halted she jumped
down. Her drenched white apron was over her
head and she was wet to the skin.</p>

<p>In the taxi, while the officer struck matches,
Christine knelt and fastened his leggings; he could
not have performed the nice operation for himself.
And all the time she was doing something else&mdash;she
was pushing forward the whole taxi, till her
muscles ached with the effort. Then she sat back
on the seat, smoothed her hair under the hat,
unclasped the bag, and patted her features
delicately with the powder-puff. Neither knew
the exact time, and in vain they tried to discern
the faces of clocks that flew past them in the heavy
rain. Christine sighed and said:</p>

<p>&quot;These tempests. This rain. They say it is
because of the big cannons&mdash;which break the
clouds.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page144" id="page144">[144]</a></span>
<p>The officer, who had the air of being in a dream,
suddenly bent towards her and replied with a
most strange solemnity:</p>

<p>&quot;It is to wash away the blood!&quot;</p>

<p>She had not thought of that. Of course it was!
She sighed again.</p>

<p>As they neared Victoria the officer said:</p>

<p>&quot;My kit-bag! It's at the hotel. Shall I have
time to pay my bill and get it? The Grosvenor's
next to the station, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>She answered unhesitatingly: &quot;You will go
direct to the train. I will try the hotel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Drive round to the Grosvenor entrance like
hell,&quot; he instructed the driver when the taxi
stopped in the station yard.</p>

<p>In the hotel she would never have got the bag,
owing to her difficulties in explaining the situation
in English to a haughty reception-clerk, had not
a French-Swiss waiter been standing by. She
flung imploring French sentences at the waiter
like a stream from a hydrant. The bill was produced
in less than half a minute. She put down
money of her own to pay for it, for she had
refused to wait at the station while the officer
fished in the obscurities of his purse. The bag, into
which a menial had crammed a kit probably scattered
about the bedroom, arrived unfastened.
Once more at the station, she gave the cabman all
the change which she had received at the hotel
counter. By a miracle she made a porter understand
what was needed and how urgently it was
needed. He said the train was just going, and ran.
She ran after him. The ticket-collector at the
platform gate allowed the porter to pass, but
<span class="newpage"><a name="page145" id="page145">[145]</a></span>
raised an implacable arm to prevent her from
following. She had no platform ticket, and she
could not possibly be travelling by the train.
Then she descried her officer standing at an open
carriage door in conversation with another officer
and tapping his leggings with his cane. How
aristocratic and disdainful and self-absorbed the
pair looked! They existed in a world utterly
different from hers. They were the triumphant
and negligent males. She endeavoured to direct
the porter with her pointing hand, and then,
hysterical again, she screamed out the one identifying
word she knew: &quot;Edgar!&quot;</p>

<p>It was lost in the resounding echoes of the
immense vault. Edgar certainly did not hear it.
But he caught the great black initials, &quot;E.W.&quot;
on the kit-bag as the porter staggered along, and
stopped the aimless man, and the kit-bag was
thrown into the apartment. Doors were now
banging. Christine saw Edgar take out his purse
and fumble at it. But Edgar's companion pushed
Edgar into the train and himself gave a tip which
caused the porter to salute extravagantly. The
porter, at any rate, had been rewarded. Christine
began to cry, not from chagrin, but with relief.
Women on the platform waved absurd little white
handkerchiefs. Heads and khaki shoulders stuck
out of the carriage windows of the shut train. A
small green flag waved; arms waved like semaphores.
The train ought to have been gliding
away, but something delayed it, and it was held
as if spellbound under the high, dim semicircle
of black glass, amid the noises of steam, the hissing
of electric globes, the horrible rattle of luggage
<span class="newpage"><a name="page146" id="page146">[146]</a></span>
trucks, the patter of feet, and the vast, murmuring
gloom. Christine saw Edgar leaning from a
window and gazing anxiously about. The little
handkerchiefs were still courageously waving, and
she, too, waved a little wisp. But he did not see
her; he was not looking in the right place for her.</p>

<p>She thought: Why did he not stay near the
gate for me? But she thought again: Because he
feared to miss the train. It was necessary that he
should be close to his compartment. He knows
he is not quite sober.</p>

<p>She wondered whether he had any relatives,
or any relations with another woman. He seemed
to be as solitary as she was.</p>

<p>On the same side of the platform-gate as herself
a very tall, slim, dandy of an officer was bending
over a smartly-dressed girl, smiling at her and
whispering. Suddenly the girl turned from him
with a disdainful toss of the head and said in a
loud, clear Cockney voice:</p>

<p>&quot;You can't tell the tale to me, young man.
This is my second time on earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine heard the words, but was completely
puzzled. The train moved, at first almost
imperceptibly. The handkerchiefs showed extreme
agitation. Then a raucous song floated from the
train:</p>

&quot;John Brown's baby's got a pimple on his&mdash;<i>shoooo</i>&mdash;<br />
John Brown's baby's got a pimple on his&mdash;<i>shoooo</i>&mdash;<br />
John Brown's baby's got a pimple on his&mdash;<i>shoooo</i>&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and we all went marching home.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Glory, glory, Alleluia!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Glory, glory ...&quot;</span><br />

<p>The rails showed empty where the train had
<span class="newpage"><a name="page147" id="page147">[147]</a></span>
been, and the sound of the song faded and died.
Some of the women were crying. Christine felt
that she was in a land of which she understood
nothing but the tears. She also felt very cold in
the legs.</p>

<h4>GETTING ON WITH THE WAR</h4>
<br />

<p>The floors of the Reynolds Galleries were
covered with some hundreds of very well-dressed
and very expensively-dressed women and some
scores of men. The walls were covered with a loan
collection of oil-paintings, water-colour drawings,
and etchings&mdash;English and French, but chiefly
English. A very large proportion of the pictures
were portraits of women done by a select group of
very expensive painters in the highest vogue. These
portraits were the main attraction of the elegant
crowd, which included many of the sitters; as for
the latter, they failed to hide under an unconvincing
mask of indifference their curiosity as to their
own effectiveness in a frame.</p>

<p>The portraits for the most part had every
quality save that of sincerity. They were
transcendantly adroit and they reeked of talent.
They were luxurious, refined, sensual, titillating,
exquisite, tender, compact, of striking poses and
subtle new tones. And while the heads were well
finished and instantly recognisable as likenesses,
the impressionism of the hands and of the provocative
draperies showed that the artists had
fully realised the necessity of being modern. The
mischief and the damnation were that the sitters
<span class="newpage"><a name="page149" id="page149">[149]</a></span>
liked them because they produced in the sitters
the illusion that the sitters were really what the
sitters wanted to be, and what indeed nearly
every woman in the galleries wanted to be;
and the ideal of the sitters was a low ideal. The
portraits flattered; but only a few guessed that
they flattered ignobly; scarcely any even of the
artists guessed that.</p>

<p>The portraits were a success; the exhibition
was a success; and all the people at the private
view justly felt that they were part of and
contributing to the success. And though seemingly the
aim of everybody was to prove to everybody else
that no war, not the greatest war, could disturb
the appearances of social life in London, yet many
were properly serious and proud in their seriousness.
It was the autumn of 1915. British troops
were triumphantly on the road to Kut, and British
forces were approaching decisive victory in
Gallipoli. The Russians had turned on their
pursuers. The French had initiated in Champagne
an offensive so dramatic that it was regarded as
the beginning of the end. And the British on their
left, in the taking of Loos and Hill 70, had achieved
what might have been regarded as the greatest
success on the Western Front, had it not been for
the rumour, current among the informed personages
at the Reynolds Galleries, that recent
bulletins had been reticent to the point of deception
and that, in fact, Hill 70 had ceased to be
ours a week earlier. Further, Zeppelins had raided
London and killed and wounded numerous
Londoners, and all present in the Reynolds
Galleries were aware, from positive statements in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page150" id="page150">[150]</a></span>
the newspapers, that whereas German morale was
crumbling, all Londoners, including themselves,
had behaved with the most marvellous stoic calm
in the ordeal of the Zeppelins.</p>

<p>The assembly had a further and particular
reason for serious pride. It was getting on with
the war, and in a most novel way. Private views
are customarily views gratis. But the entry to this
private view cost a guinea, and there was absolutely
no free list. The guineas were going to the support
of the Lechford Hospitals in France. The happy
idea was G.J.'s own, and Lady Queenie Paulle
and her mother had taken the right influential
measures to ensure its grandiose execution. A
queen had visited the private view for half an
hour. Thus all the very well-dressed and very
expensively-dressed women, and all the men who
admired and desired them as they moved, in
voluptuous perfection, amid dazzling pictures with
the soft illumination of screened skylights above
and the reflections in polished parquet below&mdash;all
of both sexes were comfortably conscious of virtue
in the undoubted fact that they were helping to
support two renowned hospitals where at that
very moment dissevered legs and arms were being
thrown into buckets.</p>

<p>In a little room at the end of the galleries was
a small but choice collection of the etchings of
F&eacute;licien Rops: a collection for connoisseurs, as
the critics were to point out in the newspapers
the next morning. For Rops, though he had an
undeniable partiality for subjects in which ugly
and prurient women displayed themselves in
nothing but the inessentials of costume, was a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page151" id="page151">[151]</a></span>
classic before whom it was necessary to bow the
head in homage.</p>

<p>G.J. was in this room in company with a young
and handsome Staff officer, Lieutenant Molder,
home on convalescent leave from Suvla Bay.
Mr. Molder had left Oxford in order to join the
army; he had behaved admirably, and well
earned the red shoulder-ornaments which pure
accident had given him. He was a youth of
artistic and literary tastes, with genuine ambitions
quite other than military, and after a year of
horrible existence in which he had hungered for
the arts more than for anything, he was solacing
and renewing himself in the contemplation of all
the masterpieces that London could show. He
greatly esteemed G.J.'s connoisseurship, and G.J.
had taken him in hand. At the close of a
conscientious and highly critical round of the
galleries they had at length reached the Rops
room, and they were discussing every aspect of
Rops except his lubricity, when Lady Queenie
Paulle approached them from behind. Molder
was the first to notice her and turn. He blushed.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Queen,&quot; said G.J., who had already
had several conversations with her in the galleries
that day and on the previous days of preparation.</p>

<p>She replied:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I hope you're satisfied with the results
of your beautiful idea.&quot;</p>

<p>The young woman, slim and pale, had long
since gone out of mourning. She was most
brilliantly attired, and no detail lacked to the
perfection of her modish outfit. Indeed, just as she
was, she would have made a marvellous mannequin,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page152" id="page152">[152]</a></span>
except for the fact that mannequins are not
usually allowed to perfume themselves in business
hours. Her thin, rather high voice, which somehow
matched her complexion and carriage, had
its customary tone of amiable insolence, and her
tired, drooping eyes their equivocal glance, as
she faced the bearded and grave middle-aged
bachelor and the handsome, muscular boy; even
the boy was older than Queen, yet she seemed to
condescend to them as if she were an immortal
from everlasting to everlasting and could teach
both of them all sorts of useful things about life.
Nobody could have guessed from that serene
demeanour that her self-satisfaction was marred
by any untoward detail whatever. Yet it was. All
her frocks were designed to conceal a serious defect
which seriously disturbed her: she was low-breasted.</p>

<p>G.J. said bluntly:</p>

<p>&quot;May I present Mr. Molder?&mdash;Lady Queenie
Paulle.&quot;</p>

<p>And he said to himself, secretly annoyed:</p>

<p>&quot;Dash the infernal chit. That's what she's
come for. Now she's got it.&quot;</p>

<p>She gave the slightest, dubious nod to Molder,
who, having faced fighting Turks with an equanimity
equal to Queenie's own, was yet considerably
flurried by the presence and the gaze of this
legendary girl. Queenie, enjoying his agitation,
but affecting to ignore him, began to talk quickly
in the vein of exclusive gossip; she mentioned in
a few seconds the topics of the imminent entry of
Bulgaria into the war, the maturing Salonika
expedition, the confidential terrible utterances of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page153" id="page153">[153]</a></span>
K. on recruiting, and, of course, the misfortune
(due to causes which Queenie had at her finger-ends)
round about Loos. Then in regard to the
last she suddenly added, quite unjustifiably
implying that the two phenomena were connected:
&quot;You know, mother's hospitals are frightfully
full just now.... But, of course, you do know.
That's why I'm so specially glad to-day's such a
success.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus in a moment, and with no more than
ten phrases, she had conveyed the suggestion that
while mere soldiers, ageing men-about-town, and
the ingenuous mass of the public might and did
foolishly imagine the war to be a simple affair,
she herself, by reason of her intelligence and her
private sources of knowledge, had a full, unique
apprehension of its extremely complex and various
formidableness. G.J. resented the familiar attitude,
and he resented Queenie's very appearance
and the appearance of the entire opulent scene.
In his head at that precise instant were not only
the statistics of mortality and major operations at
the Lechford Hospitals, but also the astounding
desolating tales of the handsome boy about folly,
ignorance, stupidity and martyrdoms at Suvla.</p>

<p>He said, with the peculiar polite restraint that
in him masked emotion and acrimony:</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I'm glad it's a success. But the machinery
of it is perhaps just slightly out of proportion to
the results. If people had given to the hospitals
what they have spent on clothes to come here
and what they've paid painters so that they could
see themselves on the walls, we should have made
twenty times as much as we have made&mdash;a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page154" id="page154">[154]</a></span>
hundred times as much. Why, good god! Queen,
the whole afternoon's takings wouldn't buy what
you're wearing now, to say nothing of the five
hundred other women here.&quot; His eye rested on
the badge of her half-brother's regiment which
she had had reproduced in diamonds.</p>

<p>At this juncture he heard himself addressed in
a hearty, heavy voice as &quot;G.J., old soul.&quot; An
officer with the solitary crown on his sleeve, bald,
stoutish, but probably not more than forty-five,
touched him&mdash;much gentler than he spoke&mdash;on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Craive, my son! You back! Well, it's startling
to see you at a picture-show, anyhow.&quot;</p>

<p>The Major, saluting Lady Queenie as a distant
acquaintance, retorted:</p>

<p>&quot;Morally, you owe me a guinea, my dear G.J.
I called at the flat, and the young woman there
told me you'd surely be here.&quot;</p>

<p>While they were talking G.J. could hear
Queenie Paulle and Molder:</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you back from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suvla, Lady Queenie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must be oozing with interest and actuality.
Tell G.J. to bring you to tea one day, quite,
quite soon, will you? <i>I</i>'ll tell him.&quot; And Molder
murmured something fatuously conventional.
G.J. showed decorously that he had caught his
own name. Whereupon Lady Queenie, instead
of naming a day for tea, addressed him almost
bitterly:</p>

<p>&quot;G.J., what's come over you? What in the
name of Pan do you suppose all you males are
fighting each other for?&quot; She paused effectively.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page155" id="page155">[155]</a></span>
&quot;Good god! If I began to dress like a housemaid
the Germans would be in London in a
month. Our job as women is quite delicate
enough without you making it worse by any
damned sentimental superficiality.... I want you
to bring Mr. Molder to tea <i>to-morrow</i>, and if you
can't come he must come alone....&quot;</p>

<p>With a last strange look at Molder she retired
into the glitter of the crowded larger room.</p>

<p>&quot;She been driving any fresh men to suicide
lately?&quot; Major Craive demanded acidly under his
breath.</p>

<p>G.J. raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>Then: &quot;That's not <i>you</i>, Frankie!&quot; said the Major
with a start of recognition towards the Staff
lieutenant.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Molder.</p>

<p>They shook hands. At the previous Christmas
they had lain out together on the cliffs of the
east coast in wild weather, waiting to repel a
phantom army of thirty thousand Germans.</p>

<p>&quot;It was the red hat put me off,&quot; the Major
explained.</p>

<p>&quot;Not my fault, sir,&quot; Molder smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;Devilish glad to see you, my boy.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. murmured to Molder:</p>

<p>&quot;You don't want to go and have tea with her,
do you?&quot;</p>

<p>And Molder answered, with the somewhat
fatuous, self-conscious grin that no amount of
intelligence can keep out of the face of a good-looking
fellow who knows that he has made an
impression:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I don't know&mdash;&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page156" id="page156">[156]</a></span>
<p>G.J. raised his eyebrows again, but with
indulgence, and winked at Craive.</p>

<p>The Major shut his lips tight, then stood with
his mouth open for a second or two in the attitude
of a man suddenly receiving the onset of a great
and original idea.</p>

<p>&quot;She's right, hang it all!&quot; he exclaimed.
&quot;She's right! Of course she is! Why, what's
all this&quot;&mdash;he waved an arm at the whole scene&mdash;&quot;what's
all this but sex? Look at 'em! And
look at their portraits! You aren't going to tell
me! What's the good of pretending? Hang it
all, when my own aunt comes down to breakfast
in a low-cut blouse that would have given her fits
even in the evening ten years ago!... And jolly
fine too. I'm all for it. The more of it the merrier&mdash;that's
what I say. And don't any of you high-brows
go trying to alter it. If you do I retire, and
you can defend your own bally Front.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Craive,&quot; said G.J. affectionately, &quot;until you
and Queen came along Molder and I really
thought we were at a picture exhibition, and we
still think so, don't we, Molder?&quot; The Lieutenant
nodded. &quot;Now, as you're here, just let me show
you one or two things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; breathed the Major, &quot;have pity. It's
not any canvas woman that I want&mdash;By
Jove!&quot; He caught sight of an invention of
F&eacute;licien Rops, a pig on the end of a string, leading,
or being driven by, a woman who wore
nothing but stockings, boots and a hat. &quot;What
do you call that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear fellow, that's one of the most famous
etchings in the world.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page157" id="page157">[157]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Is it?&quot; the Major said. &quot;Well, I'm not
surprised. There's more in this business than I
imagined.&quot; He set himself to examine all the
exhibits by Rops, and when he had finished he
turned to G.J.</p>

<p>&quot;Listen here, G.J. We're going to make a
night of it. I've decided on that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, dear heart,&quot; said G.J. &quot;I'm engaged
with Molder to-night. We shall have some private
chamber-music at my rooms&mdash;just for ourselves.
You ought to come. Much better for your health.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What time will the din be over?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About eleven.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now I say again&mdash;listen here. Let's talk
business. I'll come to your chamber-music. I've
been before, and survived, and I'll come again.
But afterwards you'll come with me to the Guinea-Fowl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, my dear chap, I can't throw Molder out
into Vigo Street at eleven o'clock,&quot; G.J. protested,
startled by the blunt mention of the
notorious night-club in the young man's presence.</p>

<p>&quot;Naturally you can't. He'll come along with
us. Frankie and I have nearly fallen into the
North Sea or German Ocean together, haven't
we, Frankie? It'll be my show. And I'll turn up
with the stuff&mdash;one, two or three pretty ladies
according as your worship wishes.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. was now more than startled; he was
shocked; he felt his cheeks reddening. It was the
presence of Molder that confused him. Never
had he talked to Molder on any subjects but the
arts, and if they had once or twice lighted on the
topic of women it was only in connection with the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page158" id="page158">[158]</a></span>
arts. He was really interested in and admired
Molder's unusual aesthetic intelligence, and he had
done what he could to foster it, and he immensely
appreciated Molder's youthful esteem for himself.
Moreover, he was easily old enough to be Molder's
father. It seemed to him that though two generations
might properly mingle in anything else, they
ought not to mingle in licence. Craive's crudity
was extraordinary.</p>

<p>&quot;See here!&quot; Craive went on, serious and
determined. &quot;You know the sort of thing I've
come from. I got four days unexpected. I had
to run down to my uncle's. The old things would
have died if I hadn't. To-morrow I go back.
This is my last night. I haven't had a scratch up
to now. But my turn's coming, you bet. Next week
I may be in heaven or hell or anywhere, or blind
for life or without my legs or any damn thing you
please. But I'm going to have to-night, and you're
going to join in.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. saw the look of simple, half-worshipful
appeal that sometimes came into Craive's rather
ingenuous face. He well knew that look, and it
always touched him. He remembered certain
descriptive letters which he had received from
Craive at the Front,&mdash;they corresponded faithfully.
He could not have explained the intimacy
of his relations with Craive. They had begun at a
club, over cards. The two had little in common&mdash;Craive
was a stockbroker when world-wars did
not happen to be in progress&mdash;but G.J. greatly
liked him because, with all his crudity, he was
such a decent, natural fellow, so kind-hearted,
so fresh and unassuming. And Craive on his part
<span class="newpage"><a name="page159" id="page159">[159]</a></span>
had developed an admiration for G.J. which G.J.
was quite at a loss to account for. The one clue
to the origin of the mysterious attachment
between them had been a naive phrase which he
had once overheard Craive utter to a mutual
acquaintance: &quot;Old G.J.'s so subtle, isn't he?&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. said to himself, reconsidering the proposal:</p>

<p>&quot;And why on earth not?&quot;</p>

<p>And then aloud, soothingly, to Craive:</p>

<p>&quot;All right! All right!&quot;</p>

<p>The Major brightened and said to Molder:</p>

<p>&quot;You'll come, of course?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, rather!&quot; answered Molder, quite simply.</p>

<p>And G.J., again to himself, said:</p>

<p>&quot;I am a simpleton.&quot;</p>

<p>The Major's pleading, and the spectacle of the
two officers with their precarious hold on life,
humiliated G.J. as well as touched him. And, if
only in order to avoid the momentary humiliation,
he would have been well content to be able to roll
back his existence and to have had a military
training and to be with them in the sacred and
proud uniform.</p>

<p>&quot;Now listen here!&quot; said the Major. &quot;About
the aforesaid pretty ladies&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>There they stood together in the corner, hiding
several of Rops's eccentricities, ostensibly discussing
art, charity, world-politics, the strategy of
war, the casualty lists.</p>

<h4>THE CALL</h4>
<br />

<p>Christine found the night at the guinea-fowl
rather dull. The supper-room, garish and tawdry
in its decorations, was functioning as usual. The
round tables and the square tables, the tables large
and the tables small, were well occupied with
mixed parties and couples. Each table had its own
yellow illumination, and the upper portion of the
room, with a certain empty space in the centre
of it, was bafflingly shadowed. Between two high,
straight falling curtains could be seen a section
of the ball-room, very bright against the curtains,
with the figures of dancers whose bodies seemed
to be glued to each other, pale to black or pale
to khaki, passing slowly and rhythmically across.
The rag-time music, over a sort of ground-bass of
syncopated tom-tom, surged through the curtains
like a tide of the sea of Aphrodite, and bathed
everyone at the supper-tables in a mysterious
aphrodisiacal fluid. The waiters alone were insensible
to its influence. They moved to and fro
with the impassivity and disdain of eunuchs
separated for ever from the world's temptations.
Loud laughs or shrill little shrieks exploded at
intervals from the sinister melancholy of the
interior.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page161" id="page161">[161]</a></span>
<p>On Christine's left, at a round table in a corner,
sat G.J.; on her right, the handsome boy Molder.
On Molder's right, Miss Aida Altown spread her
amplitude, and on G.J.'s left was a young girl
known to the company as Alice. Major Craive,
the host, the splendid quality of whose hospitality
was proved by the flowers, the fruit, the bottles,
the cigar-boxes and the cigarette-boxes on the
table, sat between Alice and Aida Altown.</p>

<p>The three women on principle despised and
scorned each other with false warm smiles and
sudden outbursts of compliment. Christine knew
that the other two detested her as being &quot;one of
those French girls&quot; who, under the protection of
Free Trade, came to London and, by their lack
of scruple and decency, took the bread out of the
mouths of the nice, modest, respectable, English
girls. She on her side disdained both of them,
not merely because they were courtesans (which
somehow Christine considered she really was not),
but also for their characteristic insipidity,
lackadaisicalness and ignorance of the technique of
the profession. They expected to be paid for doing
nothing.</p>

<p>Aida Altown she knew by sight as belonging
to a great rival Promenade. Aida had reached
the purgatory of obesity which Christine always
feared. Despite the largeness of her mass, she
was a very beautiful woman in the English manner,
blonde, soft, idle, without a trace of temperament,
and incomparably dull and stupid. But she was
ageing; she had been favourably known in the
West End continuously (save for a brief escapade
in New York) for perhaps a quarter of a century.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page162" id="page162">[162]</a></span>
She was at the period when such as she realise
with flaccid alarm that they have no future, and
when they are ready to risk grave imprudences for
youths who feel flattered by their extreme
maturity. Christine gazed calmly at her, supercilious
and secure in the immense advantage of at
least fifteen years to the good.</p>

<p>And if she shrugged her shoulders at Aida for
being too old, Christine did the same at Alice for
being too young. Alice was truly a girl&mdash;probably
not more than seventeen. Her pert, pretty,
infantile face was an outrage against the code.
She was a mere amateur, with everything to learn,
absurdly presuming upon the very quality which
would vanish first. And she was a fool. She
obviously had no sense, not even the beginnings of
sense. She was wearing an impudently expensive
frock which must have cost quite five times as
much as Christine's own, though the latter in the
opinion of the wearer was by far the more
authentically <i>chic</i>. And she talked proudly at
large about her losses on the turf and of the
swindles practised upon her. Christine admitted
that the girl could make plenty of money, and
would continue to make money for a long, long
time, bar accidents, but her final conclusion about
Alice was: &quot;She will end on straw.&quot;</p>

<p>The supper was over. The conversation had
never been vivacious, and now it was half-drowned
in champagne. The girls had wanted to hear
about the war, but the Major, who had arrived in
a rather dogmatic mood, put an absolute ban on
shop. Alice had then kept the talk, such as it was,
upon her favourite topic&mdash;revues. She was an
<span class="newpage"><a name="page163" id="page163">[163]</a></span>
encyclopaedia of knowledge concerning revues
past, present, and to come. She had once indeed
figured for a few grand weeks in a revue chorus,
thereby acquiring unique status in her world. The
topic palled upon both Aida and Christine. And
Christine had said to herself: &quot;They are aware of
nothing, those two,&quot; for Aida and Alice had
proved to be equally and utterly ignorant of the
superlative social event of the afternoon, the
private view at the Reynolds Galleries&mdash;at which
indeed Christine had not assisted, but of which she
had learnt all the intimate details from G.J.
What, Christine demanded, <i>could</i> be done with
such a pair of ninnies?</p>

<p>She might have been excused for abandoning
all attempt to behave as a woman of the world
should at a supper party. Nevertheless, she continued
good-naturedly and conscientiously in the
performance of her duty to charm, to divert, and
to enliven. After all, the ladies were there to
captivate the males, and if Aida and Alice dishonestly
flouted obligations, Christine would not.
She would, at any rate, show them how to behave.</p>

<p>She especially attended to G.J., who having
drunk little, was taciturn and preoccupied in his
amiabilities. She divined that something was the
matter, but she could not divine that his thoughts
were saddened by the recollection at the Guinea-Fowl
of the lovely music which he had heard
earlier in his drawing-room and by the memory of
the Major's letters and of what the Major had said
at the Reynolds Galleries about the past and the
possibilities of the future. The Major was very
benevolently intoxicated, and at short intervals he
<span class="newpage"><a name="page164" id="page164">[164]</a></span>
raised his glass to G.J., who did not once fail to
respond with an affectionate smile which
Christine had never before seen on G.J.'s face.</p>

<p>Suddenly Alice, who had been lounging semi-somnolent
with an extinct cigarette in her jewelled
fingers, sat up and said in the uncertain voice of
an inexperienced girl who has ceased to count the
number of glasses emptied:</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I recite? I've been trained, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>And, not waiting for an answer, she stood and
recited, with a surprisingly correct and sure
pronunciation of difficult words to show that
she had, in fact, received some training:</p>

Helen, thy beauty is to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like those Nicean barks of yore,</span><br />
That gently o'er a perfumed sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The weary, wayworn wanderer bore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To his own native shore.</span><br />
<br />
On desperate seas long wont to roam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,</span><br />
Thy naiad airs have brought me home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the glory that was Greece,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the grandeur that was Rome.</span><br />
<br />
Lo! In your brilliant window niche,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How statue-like I see thee stand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The agate lamp within thy hand!</span><br />
Ah, Psyche from the regions which<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are Holy Land!</span><br />

<p>The uncomprehended marvellous poem, having
startled the whole room, ceased, and the rag-time
<span class="newpage"><a name="page165" id="page165">[165]</a></span>
resumed its sway. A drunken &quot;Bravo!&quot; came
from one table, a cheer from another. Young
Alice nodded an acknowledgment and sank loosely
into her chair, exhausted by her last effort against
the spell of champagne and liqueurs. And the
naive, big Major, bewitched by the child, subsided
into soft contact with her, and they almost
tearfully embraced. A waiter sedately replaced a
glass which Alice's drooping, negligent hand had
over-turned, and wiped the cloth. G.J. was silent.
The whole table was silent.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Est-ce de la grande po&eacute;sie</i>?&quot; asked Christine of
G.J., who did not reply. Christine, though she
condemned Alice as now disgusting, had been
taken aback and, in spite of herself, much impressed
by the surprising display of elocution.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Oui</i>,&quot; said Molder, in his clipped, self-conscious
Oxford French.</p>

<p>Two couples from other tables were dancing in
the middle of the room.</p>

<p>Molder demanded, leaning towards her:</p>

<p>&quot;I say, do you dance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But certainly,&quot; said Christine. &quot;I learnt at the
convent.&quot; And she spoke of her convent education,
a triumphant subject with her, though she
had actually spent less than a year in the convent.</p>

<p>After a few moments they both rose, and
Christine, bending over G.J., whispered lovingly
in his ear:</p>

<p>&quot;Dear, thou wilt not be jealous if I dance one
turn with thy young friend?&quot;</p>

<p>She was addressing the wrong person. Already
throughout the supper Aida, ignoring the fact
that the whole structure of civilised society is
<span class="newpage"><a name="page166" id="page166">[166]</a></span>
based on the rule that at a meal a man must talk
first to the lady on his right and then to the lady
on his left and so on infinitely, had secretly taken
exception to the periodic intercourse&mdash;and particularly
the intercourse in French&mdash;between
Christine and Molder, who was officially &quot;hers&quot;.
That these two should go off and dance together
was the supreme insult to her. By ill-chance she
had not sufficient physical command of herself.</p>

<p>Christine felt that Molder would have danced
better two hours earlier; but still he danced
beautifully. Their bodies fitted like two parts of a
jigsaw puzzle that have discovered each other. She
realised that G.J. was middle-aged, and regret
tinctured the ecstasy of the dance. Then suddenly
she heard a loud, imploring cry in her ear:</p>

<p>&quot;Christine!&quot;</p>

<p>She looked round, pale, still dancing, but only
by inertia.</p>

<p>Nobody was near her. The four people at the
Major's table gave no sign of agitation or even of
interest. The Major still had Alice more or less
in his arms.</p>

<p>&quot;What was that?&quot; she asked wildly.</p>

<p>&quot;What was what?&quot; said Molder, at a loss to
understand her extraordinary demeanour.</p>

<p>And she heard the cry again, and then again:</p>

<p>&quot;Christine! Christine!&quot;</p>

<p>She recognised the voice. It was the voice of
the officer whom she had taken to Victoria Station
one Sunday night months and months ago.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me!&quot; she said, slipping from Molder's
hold, and she hurried out of the room to the
ladies' cloakroom, got her wraps, and ran past
<span class="newpage"><a name="page167" id="page167">[167]</a></span>
the watchful guardian, through the dark, dubious
portico of the club into the street. The thing was
done in a moment, and why she did it she could
not tell. She knew simply that she must do it, and
that she was under the dominion of those unseen
powers in whom she had always believed. She
forgot the Guinea-Fowl as completely as though
it had been a pre-natal phenomenon with her.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page168" id="page168">[168]</a></span>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="Chapter_24"></a><h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<h4>THE SOLDIER</h4>
<br />

<p>But outside she lost faith. Half a dozen
motor-cars were slumbering in a row near the door
of the Guinea-Fowl, and they all stirred monstrously
yet scarcely perceptibly at the sight of the
woman's figure, solitary, fragile and pale in the
darkness. They seemed for an instant to lust for
her; and then, recognising that she was not their
prey, to sink back into the torpor of their inexhaustible
patience. The sight of them was prejudicial
to the dominion of the unseen powers. Christine
admitted to herself that she had drunk a lot, that
she was demented, that her only proper course was
to return dutifully to the supper-party. She
wondered what, if she did not so return, she could
possibly say to justify herself to G.J.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she went on down the street,
hurrying, automatic, and reached the main
thoroughfare. It was dark with the new protective
darkness. The central hooded lamps showed like
poor candles, making a series of rings of feeble
illumination on the vast invisible floor of the road.
Nobody was afoot; not a soul. The last of the
motor-buses that went about killing and maiming
people in the new protective darkness had long
since reached its yard. The seductive dim violet
<span class="newpage"><a name="page160" id="page169">[169]</a></span>
bulbs were all extinguished on the entrances of
the theatres, and, save for a thread of light at some
lofty window here and there, the curving facades
of the street were as undecipherable as the heavens
above or as the asphalte beneath.</p>

<p>Then Christine's ear detected a faint roar. It
grew louder; it became terrific; and a long succession
of huge loaded army waggons with peering
head-lamps thundered past at full speed, one
close behind the next, shaking the very avenue.
The slightest misjudgment by the leading waggon
in the confusion of light and darkness&mdash;and the
whole convoy would have pitched itself together
in a mass of iron, flesh, blood and ordnance; but
the convoy went ruthlessly and safely forward till
its final red tail-lamp swung round a corner and
vanished. The avenue ceased to shake. The
thunder died away, and there was silence again.
Whence and why the convoy came, and at whose
dread omnipotent command? Whither it was
bound? What it carried? No answer in the
darkness to these enigmas!... And Christine was
afraid of England. She remembered people in
Ostend saying that England would never go to
war. She, too, had said it, bitterly. And now she
was in the midst of the unmeasured city which
had darkened itself for war, and she was afraid of
an unloosed might....</p>

<p>What madness was she doing? She did not
even know the man's name. She knew only that
he was &quot;Edgar W.&quot; She would have liked to be
his <i>marraine</i>, according to the French custom, but
he had never written to her. He was still in her
debt for the hotel bill and the taxi fare. He had
<span class="newpage"><a name="page170" id="page170">[170]</a></span>
not even kissed her at the station. She tried to
fancy that she heard his voice calling &quot;Christine&quot;
with frantic supplication in her ears, but she could
not. She turned into another side street, and saw
a lighted doorway. Two soldiers were standing in
the veiled radiance. She could just read the lower
half of the painted notice: &quot;All service men
welcome. Beds. Meals. Writing and reading
rooms. Always open.&quot; She passed on. One of the
soldiers, a non-commissioned officer of mature
years, solemnly winked at her, without moving an
unnecessary muscle. She looked modestly down.</p>

<p>Twenty yards further on she described near a
lamp-post a tall soldier whose somewhat bent body
seemed to be clustered over with pots, pans, tins,
bags, valises, satchels and weapons, like the figure
of some military Father Christmas on his surreptitious
rounds. She knew that he must be a
poor benighted fellow just back from the trenches.
He was staring up at the place where the
street-sign ought to have been. He glanced at
her, and said, in a fatigued, gloomy, aristocratic
voice:</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me, Madam. Is this Denman Street?
I want to find the Denman Hostel.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine looked into his face. A sacred dew
suffused her from head to foot. She trembled with
an intimidated joy. She felt the mystic influences
of all the unseen powers. She knew herself with
holy dread to be the chosen of the very clement
Virgin, and the channel of a miraculous intervention.
It was the most marvellous, sweetest thing
that had ever happened. It was humanly incredible,
but it had happened.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page171" id="page171">[171]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Is it you?&quot; she murmured in a soft, breaking
voice.</p>

<p>The man stooped and examined her face.</p>

<p>She said, while he gazed at her: &quot;Edgar!...
See&mdash;the wrist watch,&quot; and held up her arm, from
which the wide sleeve of her mantle slipped away.</p>

<p>And the man said: &quot;Is it you?&quot;</p>

<p>She said: &quot;Come with me. I will look after you.&quot;</p>

<p>The man answered glumly:</p>

<p>&quot;I have no money&mdash;at least not enough for you.
And I owe you a lot of money already. You are
an angel. I'm ashamed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Christine protested.
&quot;Do you forget that you gave me a five-pound
note? It was more than enough to pay the hotel....
As for the rest, let us not speak of it. Come
with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did I?&quot; muttered the man.</p>

<p>She could feel the very clement Virgin smiling
approval of her fib; it was exactly such a fib as the
Virgin herself would have told in a quandary of
charity. And when a taxi came round the corner,
she knew that the Virgin disguised as a taxi-driver
was steering it, and she hailed it with a firm and yet
loving gesture.</p>

<p>The taxi stopped. She opened the door, and
in her sombre mantle and bright trailing frock
and glinting, pale shoes she got in, and the
military Father Christmas with much difficulty
and jingling and clinking insinuated himself after
her into the vehicle, and banged to the door.
And at the same moment one of the soldiers from
the Hostel ran up:</p>

<p>&quot;Here, mate!... What do you want to take
<span class="newpage"><a name="page172" id="page172">[172]</a></span>
his money from him for, you damned w&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>But the taxi drove off. Christine had not
understood. And had she understood, she would
not have cared. She had a divine mission; she
was in bliss.</p>

<p>&quot;You did not seem surprised to meet me,&quot; she
said, taking Edgar's rough hand.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Had you called out my name&mdash;'Christine'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are sure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps you were thinking of me? I was
thinking of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps. I don't know. But I'm never
surprised.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must be very tired?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why are you like that? All these things?
You are not an officer now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I had to resign my commission&mdash;just
after I saw you.&quot; He paused, and added drily:
&quot;Whisky.&quot; His deep rich voice filled the taxi
with the resigned philosophy of fatalism.</p>

<p>&quot;And then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I joined up again at once,&quot; he said
casually. &quot;I soon got out to the Front. Now I'm
on leave. That's mere luck.&quot;</p>

<p>She burst into tears. She was so touched by
his curt story, and by the grotesquerie of his
appearance in the faint light from the exterior
lamp which lit the dial of the taximeter, that she
lost control of herself. And the man gave a sob,
or possibly it was only a gulp to hide a sob. And
<span class="newpage"><a name="page173" id="page173">[173]</a></span>
she leaned against him in her thin garments. And
he clinked and jingled, and his breath smelt of
beer.</p>

<h4>THE RING</h4>
<br />

<p>The flat was in darkness, except for the
little lamp by the bedside. The soldier lay asleep
in his flannel shirt in the wide bed, and Christine
lay awake next him. His clothes were heaped on a
chair. His eighty pounds' weight of kit were
deposited in a corner of the drawing-room. On
the table in the drawing-room were the remains of
a meal. Christine was thinking, carelessly and
without apprehension, of what she should say to
G.J. She would tell him that she had suddenly
felt unwell. No! That would be silly. She would
tell him that he really had not the right to ask her
to meet such women as Aida and Alice. Had he
no respect for her? Or she would tell him that
Aida had obviously meant to attack her, and that
the dance with Lieutenant Molder was simply a
device to enable her to get away quietly and avoid
all scandal in a resort where scandal was intensely
deprecated. She could tell him fifty things, and
he would have to accept whatever she chose to
tell him. She was mystically happy in the
incomparable marvel of the miracle, and in her
care of the dull, unresponding man. Her heart
yearned thankfully, devotedly, passionately to the
Virgin of the VII Dolours.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page175" id="page175">[175]</a></span>
<p>In the profound nocturnal silence broken only
by the man's slow, regular breathing, she heard a
sudden ring. It was the front-door bell ringing in
the kitchen. The bell rang again and again
obstinately. G.J.'s party was over, then, and he
had arrived to make inquiries. She smiled, and
did not move. After a few moments she could
hear Marthe stirring. She sprang up, and then,
cunningly considerate, slipped from under the bed-clothes
as noiselessly and as smoothly as a snake,
so that the man should not be disturbed. The two
women met in the little hall, Christine in the
immodesty of a lacy and diaphanous garment, and
Marthe in a coarse cotton nightgown covered with
a shawl. The bell rang once more, loudly, close
to their ears.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you mad?&quot; Christine whispered with
fierceness. &quot;Go back to bed. Let him ring.&quot;</p>

<h4>THE RETURN</h4>
<br />

<p>It was afternoon in April, 1916. G.J. rang
the right bell at the entrance of the London home
of the Lechfords. Lechford House, designed
about 1840 by an Englishman of genius who in
this rare instance had found a patron with the wit
to let him alone, was one of the finest examples
of domestic architecture in the West End. Inspired
by the formidable palaces of Rome and Florence,
the artist had conceived a building in the style of
the Italian renaissance, but modified, softened,
chastened, civilised, to express the bland and yet
haughty sobriety of the English climate and the
English peerage. People without an eye for the
perfect would have correctly described it as a large
plain house in grey stone, of three storeys, with a
width of four windows on either side of its black
front door, a jutting cornice, and rather elaborate
chimneys. It was, however, a masterpiece for the
connoisseur, and foreign architects sometimes
came with cards of admission to pry into it
professionally. The blinds of its principal windows
were down&mdash;not because of the war; they were
often down, for at least four other houses disputed
with Lechford House the honour of sheltering the
Marquis and his wife and their sole surviving
<span class="newpage"><a name="page177" id="page177">[177]</a></span>
child. Above the roof a wire platform for the
catching of bombs had given the mansion a
somewhat ridiculous appearance, but otherwise
Lechford House managed to look as though it
had never heard of the European War.</p>

<p>One half of the black entrance swung open, and
a middle-aged gentleman dressed like Lord
Lechford's stockbroker, but who was in reality his
butler, said in answer to G.J.'s enquiry:</p>

<p>&quot;Lady Queenie is not at home, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it is five o'clock,&quot; protested G.J., suddenly
sick of Queen's impudent unreliability. &quot;And
I have an appointment with her at five.&quot;</p>

<p>The butler's face relaxed ever so little from its
occupational inhumanity of a suet pudding; the
spirit of compassion seemed to inform it for an
instant.</p>

<p>&quot;Her ladyship went out about a quarter of an
hour ago, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When d'you think she'll be back?&quot;</p>

<p>The suet pudding was restored.</p>

<p>&quot;That I could not say, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Damn the girl!&quot; said G.J. to himself; and
aloud: &quot;Please tell her ladyship that I've called.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Hoape, is it not, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is.&quot;</p>

<p>By the force of his raisin eyes the butler held
G.J. as he turned to descend the steps.</p>

<p>&quot;There's nobody at home, sir, except Mrs.
Carlos Smith. Mrs. Carlos Smith is in Lady
Queenie's apartments.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Carlos Smith!&quot; exclaimed G.J., who
had not seen Concepcion for some seventeen
months; nor heard from her for nearly as
<span class="newpage"><a name="page178" id="page178">[178]</a></span>
long, nor heard of her since the previous year.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ask her if she can see me, will you?&quot; said
G.J. impetuously, after a slight pause.</p>

<p>He stepped on to the tessellated pavement of
the outer hall. On the raised tessellated pavement
of the inner hall stood two meditative youngish
footmen, possibly musing upon the problems of
the intensification of the Military Service Act
which were then exciting journalists and statesmen.
Beyond was the renowned staircase, which,
rising with insubstantial grace, lost itself in silvery
altitude like the way to heaven. Presently G.J.
was mounting the staircase and passing statues by
Canova and Thorwaldsen, and portraits of which
the heads had been painted by Lawrence and the
hands and draperies by Lawrence's hireling, and
huger canvasses on which the heads and breasts
had been painted by Rubens and everything else
by Rubens's regiment of hirelings. The guiding
footman preceded him through a great chamber
which he recognised as the drawing-room in its
winding sheet, and then up a small and insignificant
staircase; and G.J. was on ground strange to
him, for never till then had he been higher than
the first-floor in Lechford House.</p>

<p>Lady Queenie's apartments did violence to
G.J.'s sensibilities as an upholder of traditionalism
in all the arts, of the theory that every sound movement
in any art must derive from its predecessor.
Some months earlier he had met for a few minutes
the creative leader of the newest development in
internal decoration, and he vividly remembered a
saying of the grey-haired, slouch-hatted man: &quot;At
<span class="newpage"><a name="page179" id="page179">[179]</a></span>
the present day the only people in the world with
really vital perceptions about decoration are
African niggers, and the only inspiring productions
are the coloured cotton stuffs designed for the
African native market.&quot; The remark had amused
and stimulated him, but he had never troubled to
go in search of examples of the inspiring influence
of African taste on London domesticity. He now
saw perhaps the supreme instance lodged in
Lechford House, like a new and truculent state
within a great Empire.</p>

<p>Lady Queenie had imposed terms on her family,
and under threats of rupture, of separation, of
scandal, Lady Queenie's exotic nest had come into
existence in the very fortress of unchangeable
British convention. The phenomenon was a war
phenomenon due to the war, begotten by the war;
for Lady Queenie had said that if she was to do
war-work without disaster to her sanity she must
have the right environment. Thus the putting
together of Lady Queenie's nest had proceeded
concurrently with the building of national projectile
factories and of square miles of offices for
the girl clerks of ministries and departments of
government.</p>

<p>The footman left G.J. alone in a room designated
the boudoir. G.J. resented the boudoir,
because it was like nothing that he had ever
witnessed. The walls were irregularly covered
with rhombuses, rhomboids, lozenges, diamonds,
triangles, and parallelograms; the carpet was
treated likewise, and also the upholstery and the
cushions. The colourings of the scene in their
excessive brightness, crudity and variety surpassed
<span class="newpage"><a name="page180" id="page180">[180]</a></span>
G.J.'s conception of the possible. He had learned
the value of colour before Queen was born, and
in the Albany had translated principle into practice.
But the hues of the boudoir made the gaudiest
effects of Regency furniture appear sombre. The
place resembled a gigantic and glittering kaleidoscope
deranged and arrested.</p>

<p>G.J.'s glance ran round the room like a hunted
animal seeking escape, and found no escape. He
was as disturbed as he might have been disturbed
by drinking a liqueur on the top of a cocktail.
Nevertheless he had to admit that some of the
contrasts of pure colour were rather beautiful,
even impressive; and he hated to admit it. He
was aware of a terrible apprehension that he would
never be the same man again, and that henceforth
his own abode would be eternally stricken for him
with the curse of insipidity. Regaining somewhat
his nerve, he looked for pictures. There were no
pictures. But every piece of furniture was painted
with primitive sketches of human figures, or of
flowers, or of vessels, or of animals. On the front
of the mantelpiece were perversely but brilliantly
depicted, with a high degree of finish, two nude,
crouching women who gazed longingly at each
other across the impassable semicircular abyss of
the fireplace; and just above their heads, on a
scroll, ran these words:</p>

<p>&quot;The ways of God are strange.&quot;</p>

<p>He heard movements and a slight cough in the
next room, the door leading to which was ajar.
Concepcion's cough; he thought he recognised it.
Five minutes ago he had had no notion of seeing her;
now he was about to see her. And he felt excited
<span class="newpage"><a name="page181" id="page181">[181]</a></span>
and troubled, as much by the sudden violence
of life as by the mere prospect of the meeting.
After her husband's death Concepcion had soon
withdrawn from London. A large engineering
firm on the Clyde, one of the heads of which happened
to be constitutionally a pioneer, was
establishing a canteen for its workmen, and
Concepcion, the tentacles of whose influence
would stretch to any length, had decided that she
ought to take up canteen work, and in particular
the canteen work of just that firm. But first of all,
to strengthen her prestige and acquire new
prestige, she had gone to the United States, with a
powerful introduction to Sears, Roebuck and
Company of Chicago, in order to study industrial
canteenism in its most advanced and intricate
manifestations. Portraits of Concepcion in
splendid furs on the deck of the steamer in the act
of preparing to study industrial canteenism in its
most advanced and intricate manifestations had
appeared in the illustrated weeklies. The
luxurious trip had cost several hundreds of pounds,
but it was war expenditure, and, moreover,
Concepcion had come into considerable sums of
money through her deceased husband. Her
return to Britain had never been published.
Advertisements of Concepcion ceased. Only a
few friends knew that she was in the most active
retirement on the Clyde. G.J. had written to her
twice but had obtained no replies. One fact he
knew, that she had not had a child. Lady Queenie
had not mentioned her; it was understood that the
inseparables had quarrelled in the heroic manner
and separated for ever.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page182" id="page182">[182]</a></span>
<p>She entered the boudoir slowly. G.J. grew
self-conscious, as it were because she was still the
martyr of destiny and he was not. She wore a
lavender-tinted gown of Queen's; he knew it
was Queen's because he had seen precisely such
a gown on Queen, and there could not possibly
be another gown precisely like that very challenging
gown. It suited Queen, but it did not suit
Concepcion. She looked older; she was thirty-two,
and might have been taken for thirty-five.
She was very pale, with immense fatigued
eyes; but her ridiculous nose had preserved
all its originality. And she had the same
slightly masculine air&mdash;perhaps somewhat
intensified&mdash;with an added dignity. And G.J.
thought: &quot;She is as mysterious and unfathomable
as I am myself.&quot; And he was impressed and
perturbed.</p>

<p>With a faint, sardonic smile, glancing at him as
a physical equal from her unusual height (she was
as tall as Lady Queenie), she said abruptly and
casually:</p>

<p>&quot;Am I changed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he replied as abruptly and casually,
clasping almost inimically her ringed hand&mdash;she
was wearing Queenie's rings. &quot;But you're tired.
The journey, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not that. We sat up till five o'clock this
morning, talking.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Queen and I.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you do that for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you see, we'd had the devil's own
row&mdash;&quot; She stopped, leaving his imagination to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page183" id="page183">[183]</a></span>
complete the picture of the meeting and the night
talk.</p>

<p>He smiled awkwardly&mdash;tried to be paternal, and
failed.</p>

<p>&quot;What about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She never wanted me to leave London. I
came back last night with only a handbag just as
she was going out to dinner. She didn't go out
to dinner. Queen is a white woman. Nobody
knows how white Queen is. I didn't know myself
until last night.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause. G.J. said:</p>

<p>&quot;I had an appointment here with the white
woman, on business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; said Concepcion negligently.
&quot;She'll be home soon.&quot;</p>

<p>Something infinitesimally malicious in the voice
and gaze sent the singular idea shooting through
his mind that Queen had gone out on purpose so
that Concepcion might have him alone for a
while. And he was wary of both of them, as he
might have been of two pagan goddesses whom
he, a poor defiant mortal, suspected of having
laid an eye on him for their own ends.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>You've</i> changed, anyhow,&quot; said Concepcion.</p>

<p>&quot;Older?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Harder.&quot;</p>

<p>He was startled, not displeased.</p>

<p>&quot;How&mdash;harder?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More sure of yourself,&quot; said Concepcion, with
a trace of the old harsh egotism in her tone. &quot;It
appears you're a perfect tyrant on the Lechford
Committee now you're vice-chairman, and all the
more footling members dread the days when you're
<span class="newpage"><a name="page184" id="page184">[184]</a></span>
in the chair. It appears also that you've really
overthrown two chairmen, and yet won't take the
situation yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>He was still more startled, but now positively
flattered by the world's estimate of his activities
and individuality. He saw himself in a new
light.</p>

<p>&quot;This what you were talking about until five
a.m.?&quot;</p>

<p>The butler entered.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I serve tea, Madam?&quot;</p>

<p>Concepcion looked at the man scornfully:</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the minor stalwarts entered and arranged
a table, and the other followed with a glittering,
steaming tray in his hands, while the butler
hovered like a winged hippopotamus over the
operation. Concepcion half sat down by the table,
and then, altering her mind, dropped on to a vast
chaise-longue, as wide as a bed, and covered with
as many cushions as would have stocked a cushion
shop, which occupied the principal place in
front of the hearth. The hem of her rich gown
just touched the floor. G.J. could see that she
was wearing the transparent deep-purple stockings
that Queen wore with the transparent
lavender gown. Her right shoulder rose high
from the mass of the body, and her head was sunk
between two cushions. Her voice came smothered
from the cushions:</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it! G.J. Don't look at me like that.&quot;</p>

<p>He was standing near the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;What's the matter,
Con?&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page185" id="page185">[185]</a></span>
<p>There was no answer. He lit a cigarette. The
ebullient kettle kept lifting its lid in growing
impatience. But Concepcion seemed to have
forgotten the tea. G.J. had a thought, distinct
like a bubble on a sea of thoughts, that if the tea
was already made, as no doubt it was, it would
soon be stewed. Concepcion said:</p>

<p>&quot;The matter is that I'm a ruined woman, and
Queen can't understand.&quot;</p>

<p>And in the bewildering voluptuous brightness
and luxury of the room G.J. had the sensation of
being a poor, baffled ghost groping in the night
of existence. Concepcion's left arm slipped over
the edge of the day-bed and hung limp and pale,
the curved fingers touching the carpet.</p>

<h4>THE CLYDE</h4>
<br />

<p>She was sitting up on the chaise-longue and
had poured out the tea&mdash;he had pushed the tea-table
towards the chaise-longue&mdash;and she was
talking in an ordinary tone just as though she
had not immodestly bared her spirit to him and as
though she knew not that he realised she had done
so. She was talking at length, as one who in the
past had been well accustomed to giving monologues
and to holding drawing-rooms in subjection
while she chattered, and to making drawing-rooms
feel glad that they had consented to subjection.
She was saying:</p>

<p>&quot;You've no idea what the valley of the Clyde is
now. You can't have. It's filled with girls, and
they come into it every morning by train to huge
stations specially built for them, and they make
the most ghastly things for killing other girls'
lovers all day, and they go back by train at night.
Only some of them work all night. I had to leave
my own works to organise the canteen of a new
filling factory. Five thousand girls in that factory.
It's frightfully dangerous. They have to wear
special clothing. They have to take off every
stitch from their bodies in one room, and run in
their innocence and nothing else to another room
<span class="newpage"><a name="page187" id="page187">[187]</a></span>
where the special clothing is. That's the only way
to prevent the whole place being blown up one
beautiful day. But five thousand of them! You
can't imagine it. You'd like to, G.J., but you
can't. However, I didn't stay there very long. I
wanted to go back to my own place. I was adored
at my own place. Of course the men adored me.
They used to fight about me sometimes. Terrific
men. Nothing ever made me happier than that,
or so happy. But the girls were more interesting.
Two thousand of them there. You'd never guess
it, because they were hidden in thickets of
machinery. But see them rush out endlessly to the
canteen for tea! All sorts. Lots of devils and cats.
Some lovely creatures, heavenly creatures, as
fine as a queen. They adored me too. They didn't
at first, some of them. But they soon tumbled to it
that I was the modern woman, and that they'd
never seen me before, and it was a great discovery.
Absurdly easy to raise yourself to be the idol of a
crowd that fancies itself canny! Incredibly easy!
I used to take their part against the works-manager
as often as I could; he was a fiend; he hated me;
but then I was a fiend, too, and I hated him
more. I used often to come on at six in the morning,
when they did, and 'sign on'. It isn't
really signing on now at all; there's a clock dial
and a whole machine for catching you out. They
loved to see me doing that. And I worked the
lathes sometimes, just for a bit, just to show
that I wasn't ashamed to work. Etc.... All that
sentimental twaddle. It pleased them. And if any
really vigorous-minded girl had dared to say it was
sentimental twaddle, there would have been a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page188" id="page188">[188]</a></span>
crucifixion or something of the sort in the cloak-rooms.
The mob's always the same. But what
pleased them far more than anything was me
knowing them by their Christian names. Not all,
of course; still, hundreds of them. Marvellous
feats of memorising I did! I used to go about
muttering under my breath: 'Winnie, wart on left
hand, Winnie, wart on left hand, wart on left
hand, Winnie.' You see? And I've sworn at
them&mdash;not often; it wouldn't do, naturally. But
there was scarcely a woman there that I couldn't
simply blast in two seconds if I felt like it. On the
other hand, I assure you I could be very tender. I
was surprised how tender I could be, now and
then, in my little office. They'd tell me
anything&mdash;sounds sentimental, but they would&mdash;and some
of them had no more notion that there's such a
thing on earth as propriety than a monkey has. I
thought I knew everything before I went to the
Clyde valley. Well, I didn't.&quot; Concepcion looked
at G.J. &quot;You know you're very innocent, G.J.,
compared to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should hope so!&quot; said G.J., impenetrably.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think of it all?&quot; she demanded
in a fresh tone, leaning a little towards him.</p>

<p>He replied: &quot;I'm impressed.&quot;</p>

<p>He was, in fact, very profoundly impressed;
but he had to illustrate the hardness in himself
which she had revealed to him. (He wondered
whether the members of the Lechford Committee
really did credit him with having dethroned a
couple of chairmen. The idea was new to his
modesty. Perhaps he had been underestimating
his own weight on the committee. No doubt he
<span class="newpage"><a name="page189" id="page189">[189]</a></span>
had.) All constraint was now dissipated between
Concepcion and himself. They were behaving to
each other as though their intimacy had never
been interrupted for a single week. She amazed
him, sitting there in the purple stockings and the
affronting gown, and he admired. Her material
achievement alone was prodigious. He pictured
her as she rose in the winter dark and in the summer
dawn to go to the works and wrestle with so
much incalculable human nature and so many
complex questions of organisation, day after day,
week after week, month after month, for nearly
eighteen months. She had kept it up; that was
the point. She had shown what she was made of,
and what she was made of was unquestionably
marvellous.</p>

<p>He would have liked to know about various
things to which she had made no reference. Did
she live in a frowsy lodging-house near the great
works? What kind of food did she get? What
did she do with her evenings and her Sundays?
Was she bored? Was she miserable or exultant?
Had she acquaintances, external interests; or did
she immerse herself completely, inclusively, in the
huge, smoking, whirring, foul, perilous hell which
she had described? The contemplation of the
horror of the hell gave him&mdash;and her, too, he
thought&mdash;a curious feeling which was not unpleasurable.
It had savour. He would not,
however, inquire from her concerning details. He
preferred, on reflection, to keep the details mysterious,
as mysterious as her individuality and as
the impression of her worn eyes. The setting of
mystery in his mind suited her.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page190" id="page190">[190]</a></span>
<p>He said: &quot;But of course your relations with
those girls were artificial, after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, they weren't. I tell you the girls were
perfectly open; there wasn't the slightest
artificiality.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but were you open, to them? Did you
ever tell them anything about yourself, for
instance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did they ever ask you to?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! They wouldn't have thought of doing
so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what I call artificiality. By the way,
how have you been ruined? Who ruined you?
Was it the hated works-manager?&quot; There had
been no change in his tone; he spoke with the
utmost detachment.</p>

<p>&quot;I was coming to that,&quot; answered Concepcion,
apparently with a detachment equal to his.
&quot;Last week but one in one of the shops there was a
girl standing in front of a machine, with her back
to it. About twenty-two&mdash;you must see her in your
mind&mdash;about twenty-two, nice chestnut hair. Cap
over it, of course&mdash;that's the rule. Khaki overalls
and trousers. Rather high-heeled patent-leather
boots&mdash;they fancy themselves, thank God!&mdash;and
a bit of lace showing out of the khaki at the neck.
Red cheeks; she was fairly new to the works. Do
you see her? She meant to be one of the devils.
Earning two pounds a week nearly, and eagerly
spending it all. Fully awake to all the possibilities
of her body. I was in the shop. I said something
to her, and she didn't hear at first&mdash;the noise of
some of the shops is shattering. I went close to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page191" id="page191">[191]</a></span>
her and repeated it. She laughed out of mere
vivacity, and threw back her head as people do
when they laugh. The machine behind her must
have caught some hair that wasn't under her cap.
All her hair was dragged from under the cap, and
in no time all her hair was torn out and the whole
of her scalp ripped clean off. In a second or two
I got her on to a trolley&mdash;I did it&mdash;and threw an
overall over her and ran her to the dressing-station,
close to the main office entrance. There was a car
there. One of the directors was just driving off.
I stopped him. It wasn't a case for our dressing-station.
In three minutes I had her at the hospital&mdash;three
minutes. The car was soaked in blood.
But she didn't lose consciousness, that child
didn't. She's dead now. She's buried. Her body
that she meant to use so profusely for her own
delights is squeezed up in the little black box in the
dark and the silence, down below where the spring
can't get at it.... I had no sleep for two nights.
On the second day a doctor at the hospital said
that I must take at least three months' holiday. He
said I'd had a nervous breakdown. I didn't know I
had, and I don't know now. I said I wouldn't take
any holiday, and that nothing would induce me to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Con?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I'd sworn, absolutely sworn to myself,
to stick that job till the war was over. You
understand, I'd sworn it. Well, they wouldn't let
me on to the works. And yesterday one of the
directors brought me up to town himself. He was
very kind, in his Clyde way. Now you understand
what I mean when I say I'm ruined. I'm ruined
with myself, you see. I didn't stick it. I couldn't.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page192" id="page192">[192]</a></span>
But there were twenty or thirty girls who saw the
accident. They're sticking it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said in a voice soft and moved, &quot;I
understand.&quot; And while he spoke thus aloud,
though his emotion was genuine, and his desire to
comfort and sustain her genuine, and his admiration
for her genuine, he thought to himself:
&quot;How theatrically she told it! Every effect was
studied, nearly every word. Well, she can't help
it. But does she imagine I can't see that all the
casualness was deliberately part of the effect?&quot;</p>

<p>She lit a cigarette and leaned her half-draped
elbows on the tea-table, and curved her ringed
fingers, which had withstood time and fatigue
much better than her face; and then she reclined
again on the chaise-longue, on her back, and sent
up smoke perpendicularly, and through the smoke
seemed to be trying to decipher the enigmas of
the ceiling. G.J. rose and stood over her in
silence. At last she went on:</p>

<p>&quot;The work those girls do is excruciating,
hellish, and they don't realise it. That's the worst
of it. They'll never be the same again. They're
ruining their health, and, what's more important,
their looks. You can see them changing under
your eyes. Ours was the best factory on the
Clyde, and the conditions were unspeakable, in
spite of canteens, and rest-rooms, and libraries,
and sanitation, and all this damned 'welfare'.
Fancy a girl chained up for twelve hours every day
to a thundering, whizzing, iron machine that never
gets tired. The machine's just as fresh at six o'clock
at night as it was at six o'clock in the morning,
and just as anxious to maim her if she doesn't look
<span class="newpage"><a name="page193" id="page193">[193]</a></span>
out for herself&mdash;more anxious. The whole thing's
still going on; they're at it now, this very minute.
You're interested in a factory, aren't you, G.J.?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered gently, but looked with
seemingly callous firmness down at her.</p>

<p>&quot;The Reveille Company, or some such name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Making tons of money, I hear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're a profiteer, G.J.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not. Long since I decided I must give
away all my extra profits.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ever go and look at your factory?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Any nice young girls working there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If there are, are they decently treated?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't know that, either.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't you go and see?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's no business of mine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it is. Aren't you making yourself glorious
as a philanthropist out of the thing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I tell you it's no business of mine,&quot; he insisted
evenly. &quot;I couldn't do anything if I went. I've
no status.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rotten system.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Possibly. But systems can't be altered like
that. Systems alter themselves, and they aren't
in a hurry about it. This system isn't new, though
it's new to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You people in London don't know what
work is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what about your Clyde strikes?&quot; G.J.
retorted.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page194" id="page194">[194]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Well, all that's settled now,&quot; said Concepcion
rather uneasily, like a champion who foresees a
fight but lacks confidence.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but&mdash;&quot; G.J. suddenly altered his
tone to the persuasive: &quot;You must know all about
those strikes. What was the real cause? We don't
understand them here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you really want to know&mdash;nerves,&quot; she said
earnestly and triumphantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Nerves?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Overwork. No rest. No change. Everlasting
punishment. The one incomprehensible thing
to me is that the whole of Glasgow didn't go on
strike and stay out for ever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's just as much overwork in London as
there is on the Clyde.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's a lot more talking&mdash;Parliament,
Cabinet, Committees. You should hear what they
say about it in Glasgow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Con,&quot; he said kindly, &quot;you don't suspect
it, but you're childish. It's the job of one part
of London to talk. If that part of London didn't
talk your tribes on the Clyde couldn't work,
because they wouldn't know what to do, nor how
to do it. Talking has to come before working,
and let me tell you it's more difficult, and it's more
killing, because it's more responsible. Excuse
this common sense made easy for beginners, but
you brought it on yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>She frowned. &quot;And what do you do? Do you
talk or work?&quot; She smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell you this!&quot; said he, smiling candidly
and benevolently. &quot;It took me a dickens of
a time really to <i>put</i> myself into anything that
<span class="newpage"><a name="page195" id="page195">[195]</a></span>
meant steady effort. I'd lost the habit. Natural
enough, and I'm not going into sackcloth about
it. However, I'm improving. I'm going to take
on the secretaryship of the Lechford Committee.
Some of 'em mayn't want me, but they'll have
to have me. And when they've got me they'll
have to look out. All of them, including Queen
and her mother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will it take the whole of your time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I'm doing three days a week now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose you think you've beaten me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Con, I do ask you not to be a child.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I am a child. Why don't you humour
me? You know I've had a nervous breakdown.
You used to humour me.&quot;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Humouring you won't do <i>your</i> nervous breakdown
any good. It might some women's&mdash;but
not yours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall humour me!&quot; she cried. &quot;I haven't
told you half my ruin. Do you know I meant to
love Carly all my life. I felt sure I should. Well,
I can't! It's gone, all that feeling&mdash;already! In
less than two years! And now I'm only sorry for
him and sorry for myself. Isn't it horrible? Isn't
it horrible?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Try not to think,&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p>She sat up impetuously.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't talk such damned nonsense! 'Try not
to think'! Why, my frightful unhappiness is the
one thing that keeps me alive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; G.J. yielded. &quot;It was nonsense.&quot;</p>

<p>She sank back. He saw moisture in her eyes
and felt it in his own.</p>

<h4>SALOME</h4>
<br />

<p>Lady Queenie arrived in haste, as though
relentless time had pursued her up the stairs.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, you're in the dark here!&quot; she exclaimed
impatiently, and impatiently switched on several
lights. &quot;Sorry I'm late, G.J.,&quot; she said perfunctorily,
without taking any trouble to put
conviction into her voice. &quot;How have you two
been getting on?&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at Concepcion and G.J. in a peculiar
way, inquisitorial and implicatory.</p>

<p>Then, towards the door:</p>

<p>&quot;Come in, come in, Dialin.&quot;</p>

<p>A young soldier with the stripe of a lance-corporal
entered, slightly nervous and slightly
defiant.</p>

<p>&quot;And you, Miss I-forget-your-name.&quot;</p>

<p>A young woman entered; she had very red
lips and very high heels, and was both more
nervous and more defiant than the young soldier.</p>

<p>&quot;This is Mr. Dialin, you know, Con, second
ballet-master at the Ottoman. I met him by sheer
marvellous chance. He's only got ten minutes;
he hasn't really got that; but he's going to see me
do my Salome dance.&quot;</p>

<p>Lady Queenie made no attempt to introduce
<span class="newpage"><a name="page197" id="page197">[197]</a></span>
Miss I-forget-your-name, who of her own accord
took a chair with a curious, dashed effrontery. It
appeared that she was attached to Mr. Dialin.
Lady Queenie cast off rapidly gloves, hat and
coat, and then, having rushed to the bell and rung
it fiercely several times, came back to the chaise-longue
and gazed at it and at the surrounding
floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you mind, Con?&quot;</p>

<p>Concepcion rose. Lady Queenie, rushing off
again, pushed several more switches, and from a
thick cluster of bulbs in front of a large mirror at
the end of the room there fell dazzling sheets of
light. A footman presented himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Push the day-bed right away towards the
window,&quot; she commanded.</p>

<p>The footman inclined and obeyed, and the
lance-corporal superiorly helped him. Then the
footman was told to energise the gramophone,
which in its specially designed case stood in a
corner. The footman seemed to be on intimate
terms with the gramophone. Meanwhile Lady
Queenie, with a safety-pin, was fastening the back
hem of her short skirt to the front between the
knees. Still bending, she took her shoes off. Her
scent impregnated the room.</p>

<p>&quot;You see, it will be barefoot,&quot; she explained
to Mr. Dialin.</p>

<p>The walls of London were already billed with
an early announcement of the marvels of the
Pageant of Terpsichore, which was to occur at the
Albert Hall, under the superintendence of the
greatest modern English painters, in aid of a fund
for soldiers disabled by deafness. The performers
<span class="newpage"><a name="page198" id="page198">[198]</a></span>
were all ladies of the upper world, ladies bearing
names for the most part as familiar as the names
of streets&mdash;and not a stage-star among them.
Amateurism was to be absolutely untainted by
professionalism in the prodigious affair; therefore
the prices of tickets ruled high, and queens had
conferred their patronage.</p>

<p>Lady Queenie removed several bracelets and a
necklace, and, seizing a plate, deposited it on the
carpet.</p>

<p>&quot;That piece of bread-and-butter,&quot; she said,
&quot;is the head of my beloved John.&quot;</p>

<p>The clever footman started the gramophone,
and Lady Queenie began to dance. The lance-corporal
walked round her, surveying her at all
angles, watching her like a tiger, imitating movements,
suggesting movements, sketching emotions
with his arm, raising himself at intervals on the
toes of his thick boots. After a few moments
Concepcion glanced at G.J., conveying to him a
passionate, adoring admiration of Queen's talent.</p>

<p>G.J., startled by her brightened eyes so suddenly
full of temperament, nodded to please her.
But the fact was that he saw naught to admire in
the beautiful and brazen amateur's performance.
He wondered that she could not have discovered
something more original than to follow the footsteps
of Maud Allan in a scene which years ago
had become stale. He wondered that, at any rate,
Concepcion should not perceive the poor, pretentious
quality of the girlish exhibition. And as he
looked at the mincing Dialin he pictured the lance-corporal
helping to serve a gun. And as he looked
at the youthful, lithe Queenie posturing in the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page199" id="page199">[199]</a></span>
shower-bath of rays amid the blazing chromatic
fantasy of the room, and his nostrils twitched to
her pungent perfume, he pictured the reverberating
shell-factory on the Clyde where girls had their
scalps torn off by unappeasable machinery, and
the filling-factory where five thousand girls
stripped themselves naked in order to lessen the
danger of being blown to bits.... After a climax
of capering Queen fell full length on her stomach
upon the carpet, her soft chin accurately adjusted
to the edge of the plate. The music ceased. The
gramophone gnashed on the disc until the footman
lifted its fang.</p>

<p>Miss I-forget-your-name raised both her feet
from the floor, stuck her legs out in a straight,
slanting line, and condescendingly clapped. Then,
seeing that Queen was worrying the piece of
bread-and-butter with her teeth, she exclaimed in
agitation:</p>

<p>&quot;Ow my!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Dialin assisted the breathless Queen to
rise, and they went off into a corner and he talked
to her in low tones. Soon he looked at his wrist-watch
and caught the summoning eye of Miss I-forget-your-name.</p>

<p>&quot;But it's pretty all right, isn't it?&quot; said Queen.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes! Oh, yes!&quot; he soothed her with an
expert's casualness. &quot;Naturally, you want to
work it up. You fell beautifully. Now you go
and see Crevelli&mdash;he's the man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall get him to come here. What's his
address?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know. He's just moved. But you'll
see it in the April number of <i>The Dancing Times</i>.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page200" id="page200">[200]</a></span>

<p>As the footman was about to escort Mr. Dialin
and his urgent lady downstairs Queen ordered:</p>

<p>&quot;Bring me up a whisky-and-soda.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's splendid, Queen,&quot; said Concepcion enthusiastically
when the two were alone with G.J.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so glad you think so, darling. How are
you, darling?&quot; She kissed the older woman
affectionately, fondly, on the lips, and then gave
G.J. a challenging glance.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed, and called out very loud:
&quot;Robin! I want you at once.&quot;</p>

<p>The secretarial Miss Robinson, carrying a
note-book, appeared like magic from the inner
room.</p>

<p>&quot;Get me the April number of <i>The Dancing
News</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Times</i>,&quot; G.J. corrected.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, <i>Times</i>. It's all the same. And write
to Mr. Opson and say that we really must have
proper dressing-room accommodation. It's most
important.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, your ladyship. Your ladyship has the
sub-committee as to entrance arrangements for
the public at half-past six.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shan't go. Telephone to them. I've got
quite enough to do without that. I'm utterly
exhausted. Don't forget about <i>The Dancing Times</i>
and to write to Mr. Opson.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, your ladyship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;G.J.,&quot; said Queen after Robin had gone,
&quot;you are a pig if you don't go on that sub-committee
as to entrance arrangements. You
know what the Albert Hall is. They'll make
a horrible mess of it, and it's just the sort
<span class="newpage"><a name="page201" id="page201">[201]</a></span>
of thing you can do better than anybody.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. But a pig I am,&quot; answered G.J. firmly.
Then he added: &quot;I'll tell you how you might
have avoided all these complications.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By having no pageant and simply going
round collecting subscriptions. Nobody would
have refused you. And there'd have been no
expenses to come off the total.&quot;</p>

<p>Lady Queenie put her lips together.</p>

<p>&quot;Has he been behaving in this style to you,
Con?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little&mdash;now and then,&quot; said Concepcion.</p>

<p>Later, when the chaise-longue and Queen's
shoes had been replaced, and the tea-things and
the head of John the Baptist taken away, and all
the lights extinguished save one over the mantelpiece,
and Lady Queenie had nearly finished the
whisky-and-soda, and nothing remained of the
rehearsal except the safety-pin between Lady
Queenie's knees, G.J. was still waiting for her
to bethink herself of the Hospitals subject upon
which he had called by special request and
appointment to see her. He took oath not to
mention it first. Shortly afterwards, stiff in his
resolution, he departed.</p>

<p>In three minutes he was in the smoking-room
of his club, warming himself at a fine, old, huge,
wasteful grate, in which burned such a coal fire as
could not have been seen in France, Italy,
Germany, Austria, Russia, nor anywhere on the
continent of Europe. The war had as yet changed
nothing in the impregnable club, unless it was that
ordinary matches had recently been substituted
<span class="newpage"><a name="page202" id="page202">[202]</a></span>
for the giant matches on which the club had
hitherto prided itself. The hour lay neglected
midway between tea and dinner, and there were
only two other members in the vast room&mdash;solitaries,
each before his own grand fire.</p>

<p>G.J. took up <i>The Times</i>, which his duties had
prevented him from reading at large in the morning.
He wandered with a sense of ease among its
multifarious pages, and, in full leisure, brought his
information up to date concerning the state of the
war and of the country. Air-raids by Zeppelins
were frequent, and some authorities talked
magniloquently about the &quot;defence of London.&quot;
Hundreds of people had paid immense sums for
pictures and objects of art at the Red Cross Sale
at Christie's, one of the most successful social
events of the year. The House of Commons was
inquisitive about Mesopotamia as a whole, and
one British Army was still trying to relieve another
British Army besieged in Kut. German submarine
successes were obviously disquieting. The supply
of beer was reduced. There were to be forty
principal aristocratic dancers in the Pageant of
Terpsichore. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
had budgeted for five hundred millions, and was
very proud. The best people were at once proud
and scared of the new income tax at 5s. in the &pound;.
They expressed the fear that such a tax would kill
income or send it to America. The theatrical profession
was quite sure that the amusements tax
would involve utter ruin for the theatrical profession,
and the match trade was quite sure that the
match tax would put an end to matches, and some
unnamed modest individuals had apparently
<span class="newpage"><a name="page203" id="page203">[203]</a></span>
decided that the travel tax must and forthwith
would be dropped. The story of the evacuation of
Gallipoli had grown old and tedious. Cranks
were still vainly trying to prove to the blunt John
Bullishness of the Prime Minister that the Daylight
Saving Bill was not a piece of mere freak
legislation. The whole of the West End and all the
inhabitants of country houses in Britain had discovered
a new deity in Australia and spent all
their spare time and lungs in asserting that all
other deities were false and futile; his earthly name
was Hughes. Jan Smuts was fighting in the
primeval forests of East Africa. The Germans
were discussing their war aims; and on the Verdun
front they had reached Mort Homme in the usual
way, that was, according to the London Press, by
sacrificing more men than any place could possibly
be worth; still, they had reached Mort Homme.
And though our losses and the French losses were
everywhere&mdash;one might assert, so to speak&mdash;negligible,
nevertheless the steadfast band of
thinkers and fact-facers who held a monopoly of
true patriotism were extremely anxious to extend
the Military Service Act, so as to rope into the
Army every fit male in the island except themselves.</p>

<p>The pages of <i>The Times</i> grew semi-transparent,
and G.J. descried Concepcion moving
mysteriously in a mist behind them. Only then
did he begin effectively to realise her experiences
and her achievement and her ordeal on the
distant, romantic Clyde. He said to himself: &quot;I
could never have stood what she has stood.&quot; She
was a terrific woman; but because she was such a
mixture of the mad-heroic and the silly-foolish, he
<span class="newpage"><a name="page204" id="page204">[204]</a></span>
rather condescended to her. She lacked what he
was sure he possessed, and what he prized beyond
everything&mdash;poise. And had she truly had a
nervous breakdown, or was that fancy? Did she
truly despair of herself as a ruined woman, doubly
ruined, or was she acting a part, as much in order
to impress herself as in order to impress others?
He thought the country and particularly its Press,
was somewhat like Concepcion as a complex. He
condescended to Queenie also, not bitterly, but
with sardonic pity. There she was, unalterable by
any war, instinctively and ruthlessly working out
her soul and her destiny. The country was somewhat
like Queenie too. But, of course, comparison
between Queenie and Concepcion was
absurd. He had had to defend himself to Concepcion.
And had he not defended himself?</p>

<p>True, he had begun perhaps too slowly to work
for the war; however, he had begun. What else
could he have done beyond what he had done?
Become a special constable? Grotesque. He
simply could not see himself as a special constable,
and if the country could not employ him more
usefully than in standing on guard over an electricity
works or a railway bridge in the middle of
the night, the country deserved to lose his services.
Become a volunteer? Even more grotesque.
Was he, a man turned fifty, to dress up and fall
flat on the ground at the word of some fantastic
jackanapes, or stare into vacancy while some
inspecting general examined his person as though
it were a tailor's mannikin? He had tried several
times to get into a Government department which
would utilise his brains, but without success. And
<span class="newpage"><a name="page205" id="page205">[205]</a></span>
the club hummed with the unimaginable stories
related by disappointed and dignified middle-aged
men whose too eager patriotism had been rendered
ridiculous by the vicious foolery of Government
departments. No! He had some work to do and
he was doing it. People were looking to him for
decision, for sagacity, for initiative; he supplied
these things. His work might grow even beyond
his expectations; but if it did not he should not
worry. He felt that, unfatigued, he could and
would contribute to the mass of the national
resolution in the latter and more racking half of
the war.</p>

<p>Morally, he was profiting by the war. Nay,
more, in a deep sense he was enjoying it. The
immensity of it, the terror of it, the idiocy of it,
the splendour of it, its unique grandeur as an
illustration of human nature, thrilled the spectator
in him. He had little fear for the result. The
nations had measured themselves; the factors of
the equation were known. Britain conceivably
might not win, but she could never lose. And he
did not accept the singular theory that unless she
won this war another war would necessarily
follow. He had, in spite of all, a pretty good
opinion of mankind, and would not exaggerate
its capacity for lunatic madness. The worst
was over when Paris was definitely saved. Suffering
would sink and die like a fire. Privations
were paid for day by day in the cash of fortitude.
Taxes would always be met. A whole generation,
including himself, would rapidly vanish and
the next would stand in its place. And at
worst, the path of evolution was unchangeably
<span class="newpage"><a name="page206" id="page206">[206]</a></span>
appointed. A harsh, callous philosophy. Perhaps.</p>

<p>What impressed him, and possibly intimidated
him beyond anything else whatever, was the onset
of the next generation. He thought of Queenie,
of Mr. Dialin, of Miss I-forget-your-name, of
Lieutenant Molder. How unconsciously sure of
themselves and arrogant in their years! How
strong! How unapprehensive! (And yet he had
just been taking credit for his own freedom from
apprehensiveness!) They were young&mdash;and he
was so no longer. Pooh! (A brave &quot;pooh&quot;!)
He was wiser than they. He had acquired the
supreme and subtly enjoyable faculty, which
they had yet painfully to acquire, of nice, sure,
discriminating, all-weighing judgment ... Concepcion
had divested herself of youth. And
Christine, since he knew her, had never had any
youthfulness save the physical. There were only
these two.</p>

<p>Said a voice behind him:</p>

<p>&quot;You dining here to-night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we crack a bottle together?&quot; (It was
astonishing and deplorable how clich&eacute;s survived in
the best clubs!)</p>

<p>&quot;By all means.&quot;</p>

<p>The voice spoke lower:</p>

<p>&quot;That Bollinger's all gone at last.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You were fearing the worst the last time I
saw you,&quot; said G.J.</p>

<p>&quot;Auction afterwards?&quot; the voice suggested.</p>

<p>&quot;Afraid I can't,&quot; said G.J. after a moment's
hesitation. &quot;I shall have to leave early.&quot;</p>

<h4>THE STREETS</h4>
<br />

<p>After dinner G.J. walked a little eastwards
from the club, and, entering Leicester Square from
the south, crossed it, and then turned westwards
again on the left side of the road leading to
Piccadilly Circus. It was about the time when
Christine usually went from her flat to her
Promenade. Without admitting a definite resolve
to see Christine that evening he had said to himself
that he would rather like to see her, or that he
wouldn't mind seeing her, and that he might, if
the mood took him, call at Cork Street and catch
her before she left. Having advanced thus far in
the sketch of his intentions, he had decided that
it would be a pity not to take precautions to
encounter her in the street, assuming that she had
already started but had not reached the theatre.
The chance of meeting her on her way was
exceedingly small; nevertheless he would not miss
it. Hence his roundabout route; and hence his
selection of the chaste as against the unchaste
pavement of Coventry Street. He knew very little
of Christine's professional arrangements, but he
did know, from occasional remarks of hers, that
owing to the need for economy and the difficulty
of finding taxis she now always walked to the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page208" id="page208">[208]</a></span>
Promenade on dry nights, and that from a motive
of self-respect she always took the south side of
Piccadilly and the south side of Coventry Street
in order to avoid the risk of ever being mistaken
for something which she was not.</p>

<p>It was a dry night, but very cloudy. Points
of faint illumination, mysteriously travelling across
the heavens and revealing the otherwise invisible
cushioned surface of the clouds, alone showed that
searchlights were at their work of watching over
the heedless town. Entertainments had drawn
in the people from the streets; motor-buses were
half empty; implacable parcels-vans, with thin,
exhausted boys scarcely descried on their rear
perches, forced the more fragile traffic to yield
place to them. Footfarers were few, except on
the north side of Coventry Street, where officers,
soldiers, civilians, police and courtesans marched
eternally to and fro, peering at one another in the
thick gloom that, except in the immediate region
of a lamp, put all girls, the young and the ageing,
the pretty and the ugly, the good-natured and the
grasping, on a sinister enticing equality. And
they were all, men and women and vehicles,
phantoms flitting and murmuring and hooting in
the darkness. And the violet glow-worms that
hung in front of theatres and cinemas seemed to
mark the entrances to unimaginable fastnesses,
and the side streets seemed to lead to the precipitous
edges of the universe where nothing was.</p>

<p>G.J. recognised Christine just beyond the
knot of loiterers at the Piccadilly Tube. The
improbable had happened. She was walking at
what was for her a rather quick pace, purposeful
<span class="newpage"><a name="page209" id="page209">[209]</a></span>
and preoccupied. For an instant the recognition
was not mutual; he liked the uninviting stare that
she gave him as he stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;It is thou?&quot; she exclaimed, and her dimly-seen
face softened suddenly into a delighted,
adoring smile.</p>

<p>He was moved by the passion which she still
had for him. He felt vaguely and yet acutely an
undischarged obligation in regard to her. It was
the first time he had met her in such circumstances.
A constraint fell between them. In five minutes
she would have been in her Promenade engaged
upon her highly technical business, displaying her
attractions while appearing to protect herself
within a virginal timidity (for this was her natural
method). In any case, even had he not set forth
on purpose to find her, he could scarcely have
accompanied her to the doors of the theatre and
there left her to the night's routine. They both
hesitated, and then, without a word, he turned
aside and she followed close, acquiescent by training
and by instinct. Knowing his sure instinct for
what was proper, she knew at once that hazard
had saved her from the night's routine, and she
was full of quiet triumph. He, of course, though
absolutely loyal to her, had for dignity's sake to
practise the duplicity of pretending to make up
his mind what he should do.</p>

<p>They went through the Tube station and were
soon in one of the withdrawn streets between
Coventry Street and Pall Mall East. The episode
had somehow the air of an adventure. He looked
at her; the hat was possibly rather large, but, in
truth, she was the image of refinement, delicacy,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page210" id="page210">[210]</a></span>
virtue, virtuous surrender. He thought it was
marvellous that there should exist such a woman
as she. And he thought how marvellous was the
protective vastness of the town, beneath whose
shield he was free&mdash;free to live different lives
simultaneously, to make his own laws, to maintain
indefinitely exciting and delicious secrecies.
Not half a mile off were Concepcion and Queen,
and his amour was as safe from them as if he had
hidden it in the depths of some hareemed Asiatic
city.</p>

<p>Christine said politely:</p>

<p>&quot;But I detain thee?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As for that,&quot; he replied, &quot;what does that
matter, after all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thou knowest,&quot; she said in a new tone, &quot;I
am all that is most worried. In this London they
are never willing to leave you in peace.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, my poor child?&quot; he asked
benevolently.</p>

<p>&quot;They talk of closing the Promenade,&quot; she
answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Never!&quot; he murmured easily, reassuringly.</p>

<p>He remembered the night years earlier when,
as a protest against some restrictive action of a
County Council, the theatre of varieties whose
Promenade rivalled throughout the whole world
even the Promenade of the Folies-Berg&egrave;re, shut its
doors and darkened its blazing facade, and the
entire West End seemed to go into a kind of
shocked mourning. But the next night the theatre
had reopened as usual and the Promenade had
been packed. Close the Promenades! Absurd!
Not the full bench of archbishops and bishops
<span class="newpage"><a name="page211" id="page211">[211]</a></span>
could close the Promenades! The thing was
inconceivable, especially in war-time, when
human nature was so human.</p>

<p>&quot;But it is quite serious!&quot; she cried. &quot;Everyone
speaks of it.... What idiots! What frightful
lack of imagination! And how unjust! What
do they suppose we are going to do, we other
women? Do they intend to put respectable
women like me on to the pavement? It is a
fantastic idea! Fantastic!... And the night-clubs
closing too!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is always the other place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Ottoman? Do not speak to me of the
Ottoman. Moreover, that also will be suppressed.
They are all mad.&quot; She gave a great sigh. &quot;Oh!
What a fool I was to leave Paris! After all, in
Paris, they know what it is, life! However, I
weary thee. Let us say no more about it.&quot;</p>

<p>She controlled her agitation. The subject was
excessively delicate, and that she should have
expressed herself so violently on it showed the
powerful reality of the emotion it had aroused in
her. Unquestionably the decency of her livelihood
was at stake. She had convinced him of the
peril. But what could he say? He could not say,
&quot;Do not despair. You are indispensable; therefore
you will not be dispensed with. These crises have
often arisen before, and they always end in the
same manner. And are there not the big hotels,
the chic cinemas, certain restaurants? Not to
mention the client&egrave;le which you must have made
for yourself?&quot; Such remarks were impossible.
But not more impossible than the very basis of
his relations with her. He was aware again of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page212" id="page212">[212]</a></span>
weight of an undischarged obligation to her. His
behaviour towards her had always been perfection,
and yet was she not his creditor? He had a
conscience, and it was illogical and extremely
inconvenient.</p>

<p>At that moment a young man flew along the
silent, shadowed street, and as he passed them
shouted somewhat hysterically the one word:</p>

<p>&quot;Zepps!&quot;</p>

<p>Christine clutched his arm. They stood still.</p>

<p>&quot;Do not be frightened,&quot; said G.J. with perfect
tranquillity.</p>

<p>&quot;But I hear guns,&quot; she protested.</p>

<p>He, too, heard the distant sounds of guns, and
it occurred to him that the sounds had begun
earlier, while they were talking.</p>

<p>&quot;I expect it's only anti-aircraft practice,&quot; he
replied. &quot;I seem to remember seeing a warning
in the paper about there being practice one of
these nights.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine, increasing the pressure on his arm
and apparently trying to drag him away, complained:</p>

<p>&quot;They ought to give warning of raids. That
is elementary. This country is so bizarre.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said G.J., full of wisdom and standing
his ground. &quot;That would never do. Warnings
would make panics, and they wouldn't help in
the least. We are just as safe here as anywhere.
Even supposing there is an air-raid, the chance of
any particular spot being hit must be several
million to one against. And I don't think for a
moment there is an air-raid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page213" id="page213">[213]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Well, I don't,&quot; G.J. answered with calm
superiority. The fact was that he did not know
why he thought there was not an air-raid. To
assume that there was not an air-raid, in the
absence of proof positive of the existence of an
air-raid, was with him constitutional: a state of
mind precisely as illogical, biased and credulous
as the alarmist mood which he disdained in others.
Also he was lacking in candour, for after a few
seconds the suspicion crept into his mind that there
might indeed be an air-raid&mdash;and he would not
utter it.</p>

<p>&quot;In any case,&quot; said Christine, &quot;they always
give warning in Paris.&quot;</p>

<p>He thought:</p>

<p>&quot;I'd better get this woman home,&quot; and said
aloud: &quot;Come along.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But is it safe?&quot; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>He saw that she was the primeval woman,
exactly like Concepcion and Queen. First she
wanted to run, and then when he was ready to
run she asked: &quot;Is it safe?&quot; And he felt very
indulgent and comfortably masculine. He
admitted that it would be absurd to expect the
conduct of a frightened Christine to be governed
by the operations of reason. He was not annoyed,
because personally he simply did not care a whit
whether they moved or not. While they were
hesitating a group of people came round the
corner. These people were talking loudly, and
as they approached G.J. discerned that one of
them was pointing to the sky.</p>

<p>&quot;There she is! There she is!&quot; shouted an eager
voice. Seeing more human society in G.J.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page214" id="page214">[214]</a></span>
and Christine, the group stopped near them.</p>

<p>G.J. gazed in the indicated direction, and lo!
there was a point of light in the sky.</p>

<p>And then guns suddenly began to sound much
nearer.</p>

<p>&quot;What did I tell you?&quot; said another voice.
&quot;I told you they'd cleared the corner at the
bottom of St. James's Street for a gun. Now
they've got her going. Good for us they're shooting
southwards.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine was shaking on G.J.'s arm.</p>

<p>&quot;It's all right! It's all right!&quot; he murmured
compassionately, and she tightened her clutch on
him in thanks.</p>

<p>He looked hard at the point of light, which
might have been anything. The changing forms
of thin clouds continually baffled the vision.</p>

<p>&quot;By god!&quot; shouted the first voice. &quot;She's hit.
See her stagger? She's hit. She'll blaze up in a
moment. One down last week. Another this.
Look at her now. She's afire.&quot;</p>

<p>The group gave a weak cheer.</p>

<p>Then the clouds cleared for an instant and
revealed a crescent. G.J. said:</p>

<p>&quot;That's the moon, you idiots. It's not a
Zeppelin.&quot;</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he wondered, and regretted,
that he should be calling them idiots. They were
complete strangers to him. The group vanished,
crestfallen, round another corner. G.J. laughed to
Christine. Then the noise of guns was multiplied.
That he was with Christine in the midst of an
authentic air-raid could no longer be doubted. He
was conscious of the wine he had drunk at the club.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page215" id="page215">[215]</a></span>
He had the sensation of human beings, men like
himself, who ate and drank and laced their boots,
being actually at that moment up there in the sky
with intent to kill him and Christine. It was a
marvellous sensation, terrible but exquisite. And
he had the sensation of other human beings beyond
the sea, giving deliberate orders in German for
murder, murdering for their lives; and they, too,
were like himself, and ate and drank and either
laced their boots or had them laced daily. And
the staggering apprehension of the miraculous
lunacy of war swept through his soul.</p>

<h4>THE CHILD'S ARM</h4>
<br />

<p>&quot;You see,&quot; he said to Christine, &quot;it was not a
Zeppelin.... We shall be quite safe here.&quot;</p>

<p>But in that last phrase he had now confessed
to her the existence of an air-raid. He knew that
he was not behaving with the maximum of
sagacity. There were, for example, hotels with
subterranean grill-rooms close by, and there were
similar refuges where danger would be less than
in the street, though the street was narrow and
might be compared to a trench. And yet he had
said, &quot;We shall be quite safe here.&quot; In others
he would have condemned such an attitude.</p>

<p>Now, however, he realised that he was very
like others. An inactive fatalism had seized him.
He was too proud, too idle, too negligent, too
curious, to do the wise thing. He and Christine
were in the air-raid, and in it they should remain.
He had just the senseless, monkeyish curiosity of
the staring crowd so lyrically praised by the
London Press. He was afraid, but his curiosity
and inertia were stronger than his fear. Then
came a most tremendous explosion&mdash;the loudest
sound, the most formidable physical phenomenon
that G.J. had ever experienced in his life. The
earth under their feet trembled. Christine gave a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page217" id="page217">[217]</a></span>
squeal and seemed to subside to the ground, but
he pulled her up again, not in calm self-possession,
but by the sheer automatism of instinct. A spasm
of horrible fright shot through him. He thought,
in awe and stupefaction:</p>

<p>&quot;A bomb!&quot;</p>

<p>He thought about death and maiming and
blood. The relations between him and those
everyday males aloft in the sky seemed to be
appallingly close. After the explosion perfect
silence&mdash;no screams, no noise of crumbling&mdash;perfect
silence, and yet the explosion seemed still
to dominate the air! Ears ached and sang. Something
must be done. All theories of safety had
been smashed to atoms in the explosion. G.J.
dragged Christine along the street, he knew not
why. The street was unharmed. Not the slightest
trace in it, so far as G.J. could tell in the gloom,
of destruction! But where the explosion had been,
whether east, west, south or north, he could not
guess. Except for the disturbance in his ears the
explosion might have been a hallucination.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw at the end of the street a
wide thoroughfare, and he could not be sure what
thoroughfare it was. Two motor-buses passed the
end of the street at mad speed; then two taxis;
then a number of people, men and women, running
hard. Useless and silly to risk the perils of
that wide thoroughfare! He turned back with
Christine. He got her to run. In the thick gloom
he looked for an open door or a porch, but there
was none. The houses were like the houses of the
dead. He made more than one right angle turn.
Christine gave a sign that she could go no farther.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page218" id="page218">[218]</a></span>
He ceased trying to drag her. He was recovering
himself. Once more he heard the guns&mdash;childishly
feeble after the explosion of the bomb. After all,
one spot was as safe as another.</p>

<p>The outline of a building seemed familiar. It
was an abandoned chapel; he knew he was in St.
Martin's Street. He was about to pull Christine
into the shelter of the front of the chapel, when
something happened for which he could not find a
name. True, it was an explosion. But the previous
event had been an explosion, and this one was
a thousandfold more intimidating. The earth
swayed up and down. The sound alone of the
immeasurable cataclysm annihilated the universe.
The sound and the concussion transcended what
had been conceivable. Both the sound and the
concussion seemed to last for a long time. Then,
like an afterthought, succeeded the awful noise of
falling masses and the innumerable crystal tinkling
of shattered glass. This noise ceased and began
again....</p>

<p>G.J. was now in a strange condition of mild
wonder. There was silence in the dark solitude of
St. Martin's Street. Then the sound of guns
supervened once more, but they were distant guns.
G.J. discovered that he was not holding Christine,
and also that, instead of being in the middle of the
street, he was leaning against the door of a house.
He called faintly, &quot;Christine!&quot; No reply. &quot;In
a moment,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;I must go out
and look for her. But I am not quite ready yet.&quot;
He had a slight pain in his side; it was naught; it
was naught, especially in comparison with the
strange conviction of weakness and confusion.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page219" id="page219">[219]</a></span>
<p>He thought:</p>

<p>&quot;We've not won this war yet,&quot; and he had
qualms.</p>

<p>One poor lamp burned in the street. He
started to walk slowly and uncertainly towards it.
Near by he saw a hat on the ground. It was his
own. He put it on. Suddenly the street lamp
went out. He walked on, and stepped ankle-deep
into broken glass. Then the road was clear again.
He halted. Not a sign of Christine! He decided
that she must have run away, and that she would
run blindly and, finding herself either in Leicester
Square or Lower Regent Street, would by instinct
run home. At any rate, she could not be blown
to atoms, for they were together at the instant of
the explosion. She must exist, and she must have
had the power of motion. He remembered that
he had had a stick; he had it no longer. He
turned back and, taking from his pocket the
electric torch which had lately come into fashion,
he examined the road for his stick. The sole
object of interest which the torch revealed was a
child's severed arm, with a fragment of brown
frock on it and a tinsel ring on one of the fingers
of the dirty little hand. The blood from the other
end had stained the ground. G.J. abruptly
switched off the torch. Nausea overcame him,
and then a feeling of the most intense pity and
anger overcame the nausea. (A month elapsed
before he could mention his discovery of the child's
arm to anyone at all.) The arm lay there as if it
had been thrown there. Whence had it come?
No doubt it had come from over the housetops....</p>

<p>He smelt gas, and then he felt cold water in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page220" id="page220">[220]</a></span>
his boots. Water was advancing in a flood along
the street. &quot;Broken mains, of course,&quot; he said
to himself, and was rather pleased with the
promptness of his explanation. At the elbow of
St. Martin's Street, where a new dim vista opened
up, he saw policemen, then firemen; then he heard
the beat of a fire-engine, upon whose brass glinted
the reflection of flames that were flickering in a
gap between two buildings. A huge pile of debris
encumbered the middle of the road. The vista was
closed by a barricade, beyond which was a pressing
crowd. &quot;Stand clear there!&quot; said a policeman
to him roughly. &quot;There's a wall going to
fall there any minute.&quot; He walked off, hurrying
with relief from the half-lit scene of busy, dim
silhouettes. He could scarcely understand it; and
he was incapable of replying to the policeman.
He wanted to be alone and to ponder himself back
into perfect composure. At the elbow again he
halted afresh. And as he stood figures in couples,
bearing stretchers, strode past him. The stretchers
were covered with cloths that hung down. Not
the faintest sound came from beneath the cloths.</p>

<p>After a time he went on. The other exit of
St. Martin's Street was being barricaded as he
reached it. A large crowd had assembled, and
there was a sound of talking like steady rain. He
pushed grimly through the crowd. He was set
apart from the idle crowd. He would tell the
crowd nothing. In a minute he was going westwards
on the left side of Coventry Street again.
The other side was as populous with saunterers as
ever. The violet glow-worms still burned in front
of the theatres and cinemas. Motor-buses swept
<span class="newpage"><a name="page221" id="page221">[221]</a></span>
by; taxis swept by; parcels vans swept by, hooting.
A newsman was selling papers at the corner.
Was he in a dream now? Or had he been in a
dream in St. Martin's Street? The vast capacity
of the capital for digesting experience seemed to
endanger his reason. Save for the fragments of
eager conversation everywhere overheard, there
was not a sign of disturbance of the town's habitual
life. And he was within four hundred yards of
the child's arm and of the spot where the procession
of stretcher-bearers had passed. One thought
gradually gained ascendancy in his mind: &quot;I am
saved!&quot; It became exultant: &quot;I might have
been blown to bits, but I am saved!&quot; Despite the
world's anguish and the besetting imminence of
danger, life and the city which he inhabited had
never seemed so enchanting, so lovely, as they
did then. He hurried towards Cork Street,
hopeful.</p>

<h4>&quot;ROMANCE&quot;</h4>
<br />

<p>At two periods of the day Marthe, with
great effort and for professional purposes, achieved
some degree of personal tidiness. The first period
began at about four o'clock in the afternoon. By
six o'clock or six-thirty she had slipped back into
the sloven. The second period began at about
ten o'clock at night. It was more brilliant while
it lasted, but owing to the accentuation of
Marthe's characteristics by fatigue it seldom lasted
more than an hour. When Marthe opened the
door to G.J. she was at her proudest, intensely
conscious of being clean and neat, and unwilling
to stand any nonsense from anybody. Of course
she was polite to G.J. as the chief friend of the
establishment and a giver of good tips, but she
deprecated calls by gentlemen in the evening, for
unless they were made by appointment the risk of
complications at once arose.</p>

<p>The mention of an air-raid rendered her
definitely inimical. Formerly Marthe had been
more than average nervous in air-raids, but she
had grown used to them and now defied them.
As she kept all windows closed on principle she
heard less of raids than some people. G.J. did
not explain the circumstances. He simply asked
<span class="newpage"><a name="page223" id="page223">[223]</a></span>
if Madame had returned. No, Madame had not
returned. True, Marthe had not been unaware
of guns and things, but there was no need to
worry; Madame must have arrived at the theatre
long before the guns started. Marthe really could
not be bothered with these unnecessary apprehensions.
She had her duties to attend to like
other folks, and they were heavy, and she washed
her hands of air-raids; she accepted no responsibility
for them; for her, within the flat, they did
not exist, and the whole German war-machine
was thereby foiled. G.J. was on the point of a
full explanation, but he checked himself. A
recital of the circumstances would not immediately
help, and it might hinder. Concealing his
astonishment at the excesses of which unimaginative
stolidity is capable, even in an Italian, he
turned down the stairs again.</p>

<p>He stopped in the middle of the stairs, because
he did not know what he was going to do, and he
seemed to lack force for decisions. No harm could
have happened to Christine; she had run off, that
was certain. And yet&mdash;had he not often heard of
the impish tricks of explosions? Of one person
being taken and another left? Was it not possible
that Christine had been blown to the other end of
the street, and was now lying there?... No!
Either she was on her way home, or, automatically,
she had scurried to the theatre, which was close
to St. Martin's Street, and been too fearful to
venture forth again. Perhaps she was looking
somewhere for <i>him</i>. Yet she might be dead. In
any case, what could he do? Ring up the police?
It was too soon. He decided that he would wait
<span class="newpage"><a name="page224" id="page224">[224]</a></span>
in Cork Street for half an hour. This plan appealed
to him for the mere reason that it was negative.</p>

<p>As he opened the front door he saw a taxi
standing outside. The taxi-man had taken one of
the lamps from its bracket, and was looking into
the interior of the cab, which was ornate with
toy-curtains and artificial flowers to indicate to
the world that he was an owner-driver and understood
life. Hearing the noise of the door, he turned
his head&mdash;he was wearing a bowler hat and a
smart white muffler&mdash;and said to G.J., with self-respecting
respect for a gentleman:</p>

<p>&quot;This is No. 170, isn't it, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>The taxi-man jerked his head to draw G.J.'s
attention to the interior of the vehicle. Christine
was half on the seat and half on the floor, unconscious,
with shut eyes.</p>

<p>Instantly G.J. was conscious of making a
complete recovery from all the effects, physical
and moral, of the air-raid.</p>

<p>&quot;Just help me to get her out, will you?&quot; he
said in a casual tone, &quot;and I'll carry her upstairs.
Where did you pick the lady up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Strand, sir, nearly opposite Romano's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The dickens you did!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shock from air-raid, I suppose, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Probably.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She did seem a little upset when she hailed
me, or I shouldn't have taken her. I was off
home, and I only took her to oblige.&quot;</p>

<p>The taxi-man ran quickly round to the other
side of the cab and entered it by the off-door,
behind Christine. Together the men lifted her up.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page225" id="page225">[225]</a></span>
<p>&quot;I can manage her,&quot; said G.J. calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me, sir, you'll have to get hold lower
down, so as her waist'll be nearly as high as your
shoulder. My brother's a fireman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right,&quot; said G.J. &quot;By the way, what's the
fare?&quot;</p>

<p>Holding Christine across his shoulder with the
right arm, he unbuttoned his overcoat with his
left hand and took out change from his trouser
pocket for the driver.</p>

<p>&quot;You might pull the door to after me,&quot; he
said, in response to the driver's expression of
thanks.</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>The door banged. He was alone with Christine
on the long, dark, inclement stairs. He felt the
contours of her body through her clothes. She
was limp, helpless. She was a featherweight.
She was nothing at all; inexpressibly girlish,
pathetic, dear. Never had G.J. felt as he felt
then. He mounted the stairs rather quickly,
with firm, disdaining steps, and, despite his being
a little out of breath, he had a tremendous
triumph over the stolidity of Marthe when she
answered his ring. Marthe screamed, and in
the scream readjusted her views concerning
air-raids.</p>

<p>&quot;It's queer this swoon lasting such a long time!&quot;
he reflected, when Christine had been deposited
on the sofa in the sitting-room, and the common
remedies and tricks tried without result, and
Marthe had gone into the kitchen to make hot
water hotter.</p>

<p>He had established absolute empire over
<span class="newpage"><a name="page226" id="page226">[226]</a></span>
Marthe. He had insisted on Marthe not being
silly; and yet, though he had already been silly
himself in his absurd speculations as to the possibility
of Christine's death, he was now in danger
of being silly again. Did ordinary swoons ever
continue as this one was continuing? Would
Christine ever come out of it? He stood with his
back to the fireplace, and her head and shoulders
were right under him, so that he looked almost
perpendicularly down upon them. Her face was
as pale as ivory; every drop of blood seemed to
have left it; the same with her neck and bosom;
her limbs had dropped anyhow, in disarray; a fur
jacket was untidily cast over her black muslin
dress. But her waved hair, fresh from the weekly
visit of the professional coiffeur, remained in the
most perfect order.</p>

<p>G.J. looked round the room. It was getting
very shabby. Its pale enamelled shabbiness and
the tawdry ugliness of nearly every object in it had
never repelled and saddened him as they did then.
The sole agreeable item was a large photograph of
the mistress in a rich silver frame which he had
given her. She would not let him buy knicknacks
or draperies for her drawing-room; she preferred
other presents. And now that she lay in the
room, but with no power to animate it, he knew
what the room really looked like; it looked like a
dentist's waiting-room, except that no dentist
would expose copies of <i>La Vie Parisienne</i> to the
view of clients. It had no more individuality than
a dentist's waiting-room. Indeed it was a dentist's
waiting-room. He remembered that he had had
similar ideas about the room at the beginning of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page227" id="page227">[227]</a></span>
his acquaintance with Christine; but he had
partially forgotten them, and moreover, they had
not by any means been so clear and desolating as
in that moment.</p>

<p>He looked from the photograph to her face.
The face was like the photograph, but in the
swoon its wistfulness became unbearable. And it
was so young. What was she? Twenty-seven?
She could not be twenty-eight. No age! A girl!
And talk about experience! She had had scarcely
any experience, save one kind of experience. The
monotony and narrowness of her life was terrifying
to him. He had fifty interests, but she had only
one. All her days were alike. She had no change
and no holiday; no past and no future; no family;
no intimate friends&mdash;unless Marthe was an
intimate friend; no horizons, no prospects. She
witnessed life in London through the distorting,
mystifying veil of a foreign language imperfectly
understood. She was the most solitary girl in
London, or she would have been were there not a
hundred thousand or so others in nearly the same
case.... Stay! Once she had delicately allowed
him to divine that she had been to Bournemouth
with a gentleman for a week-end. He could recall
nothing else. Nightly, or almost nightly, she
listened to the same insufferably tedious jokes
in the same insufferably tedious revue. But the
authorities were soon going to deprive her of the
opportunity of doing that. And then she would
cease to receive even the education that revues
can furnish, and in her mind no images would
survive but images connected with the material
arts of love. For, after all, what had they truly in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page228" id="page228">[228]</a></span>
common, he and she, but a periodical transient
excitation?</p>

<p>When next he looked at her, her eyes were
wide open and a flush was coming, as imperceptibly
as the dawn, into her cheeks. He took
her hands again and rubbed them. Marthe
returned, and Christine drank. She gazed, in weak
silence, first at Marthe and then at G.J. After
a few moments no one spoke. Marthe took off
Christine's boots, and rubbed her stockinged feet,
and then kissed them violently.</p>

<p>&quot;Madame should go to bed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am better.&quot;</p>

<p>Marthe left the room, seeming resentful.</p>

<p>&quot;What has passed?&quot; Christine murmured,
without smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;A faint in the taxi, my poor child. That
was all,&quot; said G.J. calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;But how is it that I find myself here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I carried thee upstairs in my arms.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thou?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; He spoke lightly, with careful
negligence. &quot;It appears that thou wast in the
Strand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was I? I lost thee. Something tore thee
from me. I ran. I ran till I could not run. I
was sure that never more should I see thee alive.
Oh! My Gilbert, what terrible moments! What a
catastrophe! Never shall I forget those moments!&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. said, with bland supremacy:</p>

<p>&quot;But it is necessary that thou shouldst forget
them. Master thyself. Thou knowst now what
it is&mdash;an air-raid. It was an ordinary air-raid.
There have been many like it. There will be
<span class="newpage"><a name="page229" id="page229">[229]</a></span>
many more. For once we were in the middle of
a raid&mdash;by chance. But we are safe&mdash;that is
enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the deaths?&quot;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;But there must have been many deaths!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know. There will have been deaths.
There usually are.&quot; He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Christine sat up and gave a little screech.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; She burst out, her features suddenly
transformed by enraged protest. &quot;Why wilt thou
act thy cold man?&quot;</p>

<p>He was amazed at the sudden nervous strength
she showed.</p>

<p>&quot;But, my little one&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She cried:</p>

<p>&quot;Why wilt thou act thy cold man? I shall
become mad in this sacred England. I shall become
totally mad. You are all the same, all, all, men
and women. You are marvels&mdash;let it be so!&mdash;but
you are not human. Do you then wish to
be taken for telegraph-poles? Always you are
pretending something. Pretending that you have
no sentiments. And you are soaked in sentimentality.
But no! You will not show it! You
will not applaud your soldiers in the streets. You
will not salute your flag. You will not salute even
a corpse. You have only one phrase: 'It is
nothing'. If you win a battle, 'It is nothing'
If you lose one, 'It is nothing'. If you are nearly
killed in an air-raid, 'It is nothing'. And if you
were killed outright and could yet speak, you
would say, with your eternal sneer, 'It is nothing'.
You other men, you make love with the air of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page230" id="page230">[230]</a></span>
turning on a tap. As for your women, god
knows&mdash;! But I have a horror of Englishwomen.
Prudes but wantons. Can I not guess?
Always hypocrites. Always holding themselves
in. My god, that pinched smile! And your
women of the world especially. Have they a
natural gesture? Yet does not everyone know
that they are rotten with vice and perversity?
And your actresses!... And they talk of us! Ah,
well! For me, I can say that I earn my living
honestly, every son of it. For all that I receive, I
give. And they would throw me on to the pavement
to starve, me whose function in society&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She collapsed in sobs, and with averted face
held out her arms in appeal. G.J., at once
admiring and stricken with compassion, bent and
clasped her neck, and kissed her, and kept his
mouth on hers. Her tears dropped freely on his
cheeks. Her sobs shook both of them. Gradually
the sobs decreased in violence and frequency.
In an infant's broken voice she murmured into
his mouth:</p>

<p>&quot;My wolf! Is it true&mdash;that thou didst carry
me here in thy arms? I am so proud.&quot;</p>

<p>He was not in the slightest degree irritated or
grieved by her tirade. But the childlike changeableness
and facility of her emotions touched him.
He savoured her youth, and himself felt curiously
young. It was the fact that within the last year
he had grown younger.</p>

<p>He thought of great intellectuals, artists, men
of action, princes, kings&mdash;historical figures&mdash;in
whom courtesans had inspired immortal passion.
He thought of the illustrious courtesans who had
<span class="newpage"><a name="page231" id="page231">[231]</a></span>
made themselves heroic in legend, women whose
loves were countless and often venal, and yet
whose renown had come down to posterity as
gloriously as that of supreme poets. He thought
of lifelong passionate attachments, which to the
world were inexplicable, and which the world
never tired of leniently discussing. He overheard
people saying: &quot;Yes. Picked her up somewhere,
in a Promenade. She worships him, and he adores
her. Don't know where he hides her. You see
them about together sometimes&mdash;at concerts, for
instance. Mysterious-looking creature she is.
Plays the part very well, too. Strange affair.
But, of course, there's no accounting for these
things.&quot;</p>

<p>The role attracted him. And there could be
no doubt that she did worship him utterly. He
did not analyse his feeling for her&mdash;perhaps could
not. She satisfied something in him that was
profound. She never offended his sensibilities, nor
wearied him. Her manners were excellent, her
gestures full of grace and modesty, her temperament
extreme. A unique combination! And if
the tie between them was not real and secure, why
should he have yearned for her company that
night after the scenes with Concepcion and Queen.
Those women challenged him, discomposed him,
fretted him, fought him, left his nerves raw. She
soothed. Why should he not, in the French
phrase, &quot;put her among her own furniture?&quot;
In a proper artistic environment, an environment
created by himself, of taste and moderate luxury,
she would be exquisite. She would blossom. And
she would blossom for him alone. She would live
<span class="newpage"><a name="page232" id="page232">[232]</a></span>
for his footstep on her threshold; and when he
was not there she would dream amid cushions like
a cat. In the right environment she would become
another being, that was to say, the same being,
but orchidised. And when he was old, when he
was sixty-five, she would still be young, still be
under forty and seductive. And the publishing
of his last will and testament, under which she
inherited all, would render her famous throughout
all the West End, and the word &quot;romance&quot;
would spring to every lip. He searched in his mind
for the location of suitable flats.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it true that thou didst carry me in thine
arms?&quot; repeated Christine.</p>

<p>He murmured into her mouth:</p>

<p>&quot;Is it true? Can she doubt? The proof, then.&quot;</p>

<p>And he picked her up as though she had been
a doll, and carried her into the bedroom. As she
lay on the bed, she raised her arm and looked at
the broken wrist-watch and sighed.</p>

<p>&quot;My mascot. It is not a <i>blague</i>, my mascot.&quot;</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards she began to cry again, at
first gently; then sobs supervened.</p>

<p>&quot;She must sleep,&quot; he said firmly.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot. I have been too upset. It is impossible
that I should sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She must.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go and buy me a drug.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I go and buy her a drug, will she undress
and get into bed while I am away?&quot;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>Calling Marthe, and taking the latch-key of
the street-door, he went to his chemist's in Dover
<span class="newpage"><a name="page233" id="page233">[233]</a></span>
Street and bought some potassium bromide and
sal volatile. When he came back Marthe whispered
to him:</p>

<p>&quot;She sleeps. She has told me everything as
I undressed her. The poor child!&quot;</p>

<h4>MRS. BRAIDING</h4>
<br />

<p>G.J. went home at once, partly so that
Christine should not be disturbed, partly because
he desired solitude in order to examine and compose
his mind. Mrs. Braiding had left an agreeable
modest fire&mdash;fit for cold April&mdash;in the drawing-room.
He had just sat down in front of it and
was tranquillising himself in the familiar harmonious
beauty of the apartment (which, however,
did seem rather insipid after the decorative
excesses of Queen's room), when he heard footsteps
on the little stairway from the upper floor.
Mrs. Braiding entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>This was a Mrs. Braiding very different from
the Mrs. Braiding of 1914, a shameless creature
of more rounded contours than of old, and not
quite so spick and span as of old. She was carrying
in her arms that which before the war she
could not have conceived herself as carrying. The
being was invisible in wraps, but it was there; and
she seemed to have no shame for it, seemed indeed
to be proud of it and defiant about it.</p>

<p>Braiding's military career had been full of
surprises. He had expected within a few months
of joining the colours to be dashing gloriously and
homicidally at panic-stricken Germans across the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page235" id="page235">[235]</a></span>
plains of Flanders, to be, in fact, saving the
Empire at the muzzle of rifle and the point of
bayonet. In truth, he found that for interminable,
innumerable weeks his job was to save the Empire
by cleaning harness on the East Coast of England&mdash;for
under advice he had transferred to the
artillery. Later, when his true qualifications were
discovered, he had to save the Empire by polishing
the buttons and serving the morning tea and
buying the cigarettes of a major who in 1914 had
been a lawyer by profession and a soldier only
for fun. The major talked too much, and to the
wrong people. He became lyric concerning the
talents of Braiding to a dandiacal Divisional
General at Colchester, and soon, by the actuating
of mysterious forces and the filling up of many
Army forms, Braiding was removed to Colchester,
and had to save the Empire by valeting the
Divisonal General. Foiled in one direction,
Braiding advanced in another. By tradition,
when a valet marries a lady's maid, the effect on
the birth-rate is naught. And it is certain that
but for the war Braiding would not have permitted
himself to act as he did. The Empire,
however, needed citizens. The first rumour that
Braiding had done what in him lay to meet the
need spread through the kitchens of the Albany
like a new gospel, incredible and stupefying&mdash;but
which imposed itself. The Albany was never the
same again.</p>

<p>All the kitchens were agreed that Mr. Hoape
would soon be stranded. The spectacle of Mrs.
Braiding as she slipped out of a morning past the
porter's lodge mesmerised beholders. At last,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page236" id="page236">[236]</a></span>
when things had reached the limit, Mrs. Braiding
slipped out and did not come back. Meanwhile a
much younger sister of hers had been introduced
into the flat. But when Mrs. Braiding went the
virgin went also. The flat was more or less closed,
and Mr. Hoape had slept at his club for weeks.
At length the flat was reopened, but whereas
three had left it, four returned.</p>

<p>That a bachelor of Mr. Hoape's fastidiousness
should tolerate in his home a woman with a
tiny baby was remarkable; it was as astounding
perhaps as any phenomenon of the war, and a
sublime proof that Mr. Hoape realised that the
Empire was fighting for its life. It arose from the
fact that both G.J. and Braiding were men of
considerable sagacity. Braiding had issued an
order, after seeing G.J., that his wife should not
leave G.J.'s service. And Mrs. Braiding, too,
had her sense of duty. She was very proud of
G.J.'s war-work, and would have thought it
disloyal to leave him in the lurch, and so possibly
prejudice the war-work&mdash;especially as she was
convinced that he would never get anybody else
comparable to herself.</p>

<p>At first she had been a little apologetic and
diffident about her offspring. But soon the man-child
had established an important position in the
flat, and though he was generally invisible, his
individuality pervaded the whole place. G.J. had
easily got accustomed to the new inhabitant. He
tolerated and then liked the babe. He had never
nursed it&mdash;for such an act would have been
excessive&mdash;but he had once stuck his finger in its
mouth, and he had given it a perambulator that
<span class="newpage"><a name="page237" id="page237">[237]</a></span>
folded up. He did venture secretly to hope that
Braiding would not imagine it to be his duty to
provide further for the needs of the Empire.</p>

<p>That Mrs. Braiding had grown rather shameless
in motherhood was shown by her quite casual
demeanour as she now came into the drawing-room
with the baby, for this was the first time she
had ever come into the drawing-room with the
baby, knowing her august master to be there.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Braiding,&quot; said G.J. &quot;That child ought
to be asleep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is asleep, sir,&quot; said the woman, glancing
into the mysteries of the immortal package, &quot;but
Maria hasn't been able to get back yet because of
the raid, and I didn't want to leave him upstairs
alone with the cat. He slept all through the raid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems some of you have made the cellar
quite comfortable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, sir. Particularly now with the oilstove
and the carpet. Perhaps one night you'll come
down, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I may have to. I shouldn't have been much
surprised to find some damage here to-night.
They've been very close, you know.... Near
Leicester Square.&quot; He could not be troubled to
say more than that.</p>

<p>&quot;Have they really, sir? It's just like them,&quot; said
Mrs. Braiding. And she then continued in exactly the
same tone: &quot;Lady Queenie Paulle has just been telephoning
from Lechford House, sir.&quot; She still&mdash;despite her
marvellous experiences&mdash;impishly loved to make
extraordinary announcements as if they were nothing
at all. And she felt an uplifted satisfaction in having
<span class="newpage"><a name="page238" id="page238">[238]</a></span>
talked to Lady Queenie Paulle herself on the telephone.</p>

<p>&quot;What does <i>she</i> want?&quot; G.J. asked impatiently,
and not at all in a voice proper for the mention
of a Lady Queenie to a Mrs. Braiding. He was
annoyed; he resented any disturbance of the
repose which he so acutely needed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Braiding showed that she was a little
shocked. The old harassed look of bearing up
against complex anxieties came into her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Her ladyship wished to speak to you, sir, on
a matter of importance. I didn't know <i>where</i> you
were, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>That last phrase was always used by Mrs.
Braiding when she wished to imply that she could
guess where G.J. had been. He did not suppose
that she was acquainted with the circumstances
of his amour, but he had a suspicion amounting
to conviction that she had conjectured it, as men
of science from certain derangements in their
calculations will conjecture the existence of a star
that no telescope has revealed.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, better leave Lady Queenie alone for
to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I promised her ladyship that I would ring
her up again in any case in a quarter of an hour.
That was approximately ten minutes ago.&quot;</p>

<p>He could not say:</p>

<p>&quot;Be hanged to your promises!&quot;</p>

<p>Reluctantly he went to the telephone himself,
and learnt from Lady Queenie, who always knew
everything, that the raiders were expected to
return in about half an hour, and that she and
Concepcion desired his presence at Lechford
House. He replied coldly that he was too tired
<span class="newpage"><a name="page239" id="page239">[239]</a></span>
to come, and was indeed practically in bed.
&quot;But you must come. Don't you understand we
want you?&quot; said Lady Queenie autocratically,
adding: &quot;And don't forget that business about the
hospitals. We didn't attend to it this afternoon,
you know.&quot; He said to himself: &quot;And whose fault
was that?&quot; and went off angrily, wondering what
mysterious power of convention it was that
compelled him to respond to the whim of a girl
whom he scarcely even respected.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page240" id="page240">[240]</a></span>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="Chapter_33"></a><h2>Chapter 33</h2>

<h4>THE ROOF</h4>
<br />

<p>The main door of LECHFORD HOUSE was ajar,
and at the sound of G.J.'s footsteps on the marble
of the porch it opened. Robin, the secretary, stood
at the threshold. Evidently she had been set to
wait for him.</p>

<p>&quot;The men-servants are all in the cellars,&quot; said
she perkily.</p>

<p>G.J. retorted with sardonic bitterness:</p>

<p>&quot;And quite right, too. I'm glad someone's
got some sense left.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet he did not really admire the men-servants
for being in the cellars. Somehow it seemed mean
of them not to be ready to take any risks, however
unnecessary.</p>

<p>Robin, hiding her surprise and confusion in a
nervous snigger, banged the heavy door, and led
him through the halls and up the staircases. As
she went forward she turned on electric lamps
here and there in advance, turning them off by
the alternative switches after she had passed them,
so that in the vast, shadowed, echoing interior the
two appeared to be preceded by light and pursued
by a tide of darkness. She was mincingly feminine,
and very conscious of the fact that G.J. was a
fine gentleman. In the afternoon, and again
to-night&mdash;at first, he had taken her for a mere
<span class="newpage"><a name="page241" id="page241">[241]</a></span>
girl; but as she halted under a lamp to hold a door
for him at the entrance to the upper stairs, he
perceived that it must have been a long time since
she was a girl. Often had he warned himself that
the fashion of short skirts and revealed stockings
gave a deceiving youthfulness to the middle-aged,
and yet nearly every day he had to learn the lesson
afresh.</p>

<p>He was just expecting to be shown into the
boudoir when Robin stopped at a very small door.</p>

<p>&quot;Her ladyship and Mrs. Carlos Smith are out
on the roof. This is the ladder,&quot; she said, and
illuminated the ladder.</p>

<p>G.J. had no choice but to mount. Luckily he
had kept his hat. He put it on. As he climbed
he felt a slight recurrence of the pain in his side
which he had noticed in St. Martin's Street. The
roof was a very strange, tempestuous place, and
insecure. He had an impression similar to that
of being at sea, for the wind, which he had
scarcely observed in the street, made melancholy
noises in the new protective wire-netting that
stretched over his head. This bomb-catching
contrivance, fastened on thick iron stanchions,
formed a sort of second roof, and was a very solid
and elaborate affair which must have cost much
money. The upstreaming light from the ladder-shaft
was suddenly extinguished. He could see
nobody, and the loneliness was uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Somehow, when Robin had announced that
the ladies were on the roof he had imagined the
roof as a large, flat expanse. It was nothing of
the kind. So far as he could distinguish in the
deep gloom it had leaden pathways, but on either
<span class="newpage"><a name="page242" id="page242">[242]</a></span>
hand it sloped sharply up or sharply down. He
might have fallen sheer into a chasm, or stumbled
against the leaden side of a slant. He descried a
lofty construction of carved masonry with an iron
ladder clamped into it, far transcending the net.
Not immediately did he comprehend that it was
merely one of the famous Lechford chimney-stacks
looming gigantic in the night. He walked
cautiously onward and came to a precipice and
drew back, startled, and took another pathway at
right angles to the first one. Presently the protective
netting stopped, and he was exposed to
heaven; he had reached the roof of the servants'
quarters towards the back of the house.</p>

<p>He stood still and gazed, accustoming himself
to the night. The moon was concealed, but there
were patches of dim stars. He could make out,
across the empty Green Park, the huge silhouette
of Buckingham Palace, and beyond that the tower
of Westminster Cathedral. To his left he could
see part of a courtyard or small square, with a
fore-shortened black figure, no doubt a policeman,
carrying a flash-lamp. The tree-lined Mall seemed
to be utterly deserted. But Piccadilly showed a
line of faint stationary lights and still fainter
moving lights. A mild hum and the sounds of
motor-horns and cab-whistles came from Piccadilly,
where people were abroad in ignorance that
the raid was not really over. All the heavens were
continually restless with long, shifting rays from
the anti-aircraft stations, but the rays served only
to prove the power of darkness.</p>

<p>Then he heard quick, smooth footsteps. Two
figures, one behind the other, approached him,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page243" id="page243">[243]</a></span>
almost running, eagerly, girlishly, with little cries.
The first was Queen, who wore a white skirt and
a very close-fitting black jersey. Concepcion also
wore a white skirt and a very close-fitting black
jersey, but with a long mantle hung loosely from
the shoulders. Both were bareheaded.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it splendid, G.J.?&quot; Queen burst out
enthusiastically. Again G.J. had the sensation
of being at sea&mdash;perhaps on the deck of a yacht.
He felt that rain ought to have been beating on
the face of the excited and careless girl. Before
answering, he turned up the collar of his overcoat.
Then he said:</p>

<p>&quot;Won't you catch a chill?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm never cold,&quot; said Queen. It was true.
&quot;I shall always come up here for raids in future.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You seem to be enjoying it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love it. I love it. I only thought of it to-night.
It's the next best thing to being a man and being
at the Front. It <i>is</i> being at the Front.&quot;</p>

<p>Her face was little more than a pale, featureless
oval to him in the gloom, but he could divine from
the vibrations of her voice that she was as ecstatic
as a young maid at her first dance.</p>

<p>&quot;And what about that business interview that
you've just asked for on the 'phone?&quot; G.J.
acidly demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, we'll come to that later. We wanted
a man here&mdash;not to save us, only to save us from
ourselves&mdash;and you were the best we could think
of, wasn't he, Con? But you've not heard about
my next bazaar, G.J., have you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought it was a Pageant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean after that. A bazaar. I don't know
<span class="newpage"><a name="page244" id="page244">[244]</a></span>
yet what it will be for, but I've got lots of the most
topping ideas for it. For instance, I'm going to
have a First-Aid Station.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What for? Air-raid casualties?&quot;</p>

<p>Queen scorned his obtuseness, pouring out a
cataract of swift sentences.</p>

<p>&quot;No. First-Aid to lovely complexions. Help
for Distressed Beauties. I shall get Roger Fry
to design the Station and the costumes of my
attendants. It will be marvellous, and I tell you
there'll always be a queue waiting for admittance.
I shall have all the latest dodges in the sublime and
fatal art of make-up, and if any of the Bond
Street gang refuse to help me I'll damn well ruin
them. But they won't refuse because they know
what I'll do. Gontran is coming in with his new
steaming process for waving. Con, you must try
that. It's a miracle. Waving's no good for my
style of coiffure, but it would suit you. You
always wouldn't wave, but you've got to now, my
seraph. The electric heater works in sections.
No danger. No inconvenience to the poor old
scalp. The waves will last for six months or more.
It has to be seen to be believed, and even then you
can't believe it. Its only fault is that it's too
natural to be natural. But who wants to be
natural? This modern craze for naturalness
seems to me to be rather unwholesome, not to say
perverted. What?&quot;</p>

<p>She seized G.J.'s arm convulsively.</p>

<p>Concepcion had said nothing. G.J. sought
her eyes in the darkness, but did not find them.</p>

<p>&quot;So much for the bazaar!&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Queen suddenly cried aloud:</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page245" id="page245">[245]</a></span>
<p>&quot;What is it, Robin? Has Captain Brickly
telephoned?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my lady,&quot; came a voice faintly across
the gloom from the region of the ladder-shaft.</p>

<p>&quot;They're coming! They'll be here directly!&quot;
exclaimed Queen, loosing G.J. and clapping her
hands.</p>

<p>G.J. thought of Robin affixed to the telephone,
and some scarlet-shouldered officer at the War
Office quitting duty for the telephone, in order
to keep the capricious girl informed of military
movements simply because she had taken the
trouble to be her father's daughter, and in so
doing had acquired the right to treat the imperial
machine as one of her nursery toys. And he became
unreasonably annoyed.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose you were cowering in your Club
during the first Act?&quot; she said, with vivacity.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; G.J. briefly answered. Once more
he was aware of a strong instinctive disinclination
to relate what had happened to him. He was too
proud to explain, and perhaps too tired.</p>

<p>&quot;You ought to have been up here. They
dropped two bombs close to the National Gallery;
pity they couldn't have destroyed a Landseer or
two while they were so near! There were either
seven or eight killed and eighteen wounded, so
far as is known. But there were probably more.
There was quite a fire, too, but that was soon got
under. We saw it all except the explosion of the
bombs. We weren't looking in the right place&mdash;no
luck! However, we saw the Zepp. What a
shame the moon's disappeared again! Listen!
Listen!... Can't you hear the engines?&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page246" id="page246">[246]</a></span>
<p>G.J. shrugged his shoulders. Nothing could
be heard above the faint hum of Piccadilly. The
wind seemed to have diminished to a chill, fitful
zephyr.</p>

<p>Concepcion had sat down on a coping.</p>

<p>&quot;Look!&quot; she exclaimed in a startled whisper,
and sprang erect.</p>

<p>To the south, down among the trees, a red
light flashed and was gone. The faint, irregular
hum of Piccadilly persisted for a couple of seconds,
and then was drowned in the loud report, which
seemed to linger and wander in the great open
spaces. G.J.'s flesh crept. He comprehended
the mad ecstasy of Queen, and because he comprehended
it his anger against her increased.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you see the Zepp?&quot; murmured Queen,
as it were ferociously. &quot;It must be within range,
or they wouldn't have fired. Look along the lines
of the searchlights. One of them, at any rate,
must have got on to it. We saw it before. Can't
you see it? I can hear the engines, I think.&quot;</p>

<p>Another flash was followed by another resounding
report. More guns spoke in the distance.
Then a glare arose on the southern horizon.</p>

<p>&quot;Incendiary bomb!&quot; muttered Queen. She
stood stock-still, with her mouth open, entranced.</p>

<p>The Zeppelin or the Zeppelins remained invisible
and inaudible. Yet they must be aloft
there, somewhere amid the criss-cross of the
unresting searchlights. G.J. waited, powerfully
impressed, incapable of any direct action, gazing
blankly now at the women and now at the huge
undecipherable heaven and earth, and receiving
the chill zephyr on his face. The nearmost gun
<span class="newpage"><a name="page247" id="page247">[247]</a></span>
had ceased to fire. Occasionally there was perfect
silence&mdash;for no faintest hum came from Piccadilly,
and nothing seemed to move there. The further
guns recommenced, and then the group heard a
new sound, rather like the sound of a worn-out
taxi accelerating before changing gear. It grew
gradually louder. It grew very loud. It seemed
to be ripping the envelope of the air. It seemed
as if it would last for ever&mdash;till it finished with a
gigantic and intimidating <i>plop</i> quite near the
front of Lechford House. Queen said:</p>

<p>&quot;Shrapnel&mdash;and a big lump!&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. could see the quick heave of her bosom
imprisoned in the black. She was breathing
through her nostrils.</p>

<p>&quot;Come downstairs into the house,&quot; he said
sharply&mdash;more than sharply, brutally. &quot;Where
in the name of God is the sense of stopping up
here? Are you both mad?&quot;</p>

<p>Queen laughed lightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, G.J.! How funny you are! I'm really
surprised you haven't left London for good before
now. By rights you ought to belong to the Hook-it
Brigade. Do you know what they do? They
take a ticket to any station north or west, and
when they get out of the train they run to the
nearest house and interview the tenant. Has he
any accommodation to let? Will he take them in
as boarders? Will he take them as paying guests?
Will he let the house furnished? Will he let it
unfurnished? Will he allow them to camp out in
the stables? Will he sell the blooming house?
So there isn't a house to be had on the North
Western nearer than Leighton Buzzard.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page248" id="page248">[248]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Are you going? Because I am,&quot; said G.J.</p>

<p>Concepcion murmured:</p>

<p>&quot;Don't go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall go&mdash;and so will you, both of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;G.J.,&quot; Queen mocked him, &quot;you're in a
funk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've got courage enough to go, anyhow,&quot;
said he. &quot;And that's more than you have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're losing your temper.&quot;</p>

<p>As a fact he was. He grabbed at Queen, but
she easily escaped him. He saw the whiteness of
her skirt in the distance of the roof, dimly rising.
She was climbing the ladder up the side of the
chimney. She stood on the top of the chimney,
and laughed again. A gun sounded.</p>

<p>G.J. said no more. Using his flash-lamp he
found his way to the ladder-shaft and descended.
He was in the warm and sheltered interior of the
house; he was in another and a saner world.
Robin was at the foot of the ladder; she blinked
under his lamp.</p>

<p>&quot;I've had enough of that,&quot; he said, and followed
her to the illuminated boudoir, where after
a certain hesitation she left him. Alone in the
boudoir he felt himself to be a very shamed and
futile person, and he was still extremely angry.
The next moment Concepcion entered the boudoir.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he murmured, curiously appeased.</p>

<p>&quot;You're quite right,&quot; said Concepcion simply.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>&quot;Can you give me any reason, Con, why we
should make a present of ourselves to the Hun?&quot;</p>

<p>Concepcion repeated:</p>

<p>&quot;You're quite right.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page249" id="page249">[249]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Is she coming?&quot;</p>

<p>Concepcion made a negative sign. &quot;She
doesn't know what fear is, Queen doesn't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She doesn't know what sense is. She ought
to be whipped, and if I got hold of her I'd whip
her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She'd like nothing better,&quot; said Concepcion.</p>

<p>G.J. removed his overcoat and sat down.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page250" id="page250">[250]</a></span>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="Chapter_34"></a><h2>Chapter 34</h2>

<h4>IN THE BOUDOIR</h4>
<br />

<p>&quot;We aren't so desperately safe even here,&quot;
said G.J., firmly pursuing the moral triumph
which Concepcion's very surprising and comforting
descent from the roof had given him.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't go to extremes,&quot; she answered.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I won't.&quot; He thought of the valetry in
the cellars, and the impossible humiliation of
joining them; and added: &quot;I merely state.&quot;
Then, after a moment of silence: &quot;By the way,
was it only <i>her</i> idea that I should come along, or
did the command come from both of you?&quot; The
suspicion of some dark, feminine conspiracy
revisited him.</p>

<p>&quot;It was Queen's idea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Well, I don't quite understand the
psychology of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Surely that's plain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't in the least plain.&quot;</p>

<p>Concepcion loosed and dropped her cloak, and,
not even glancing at G.J., went to the fire and
teased it with the poker. Bending down, with one
hand on the graphic and didactic mantelpiece,
and staring into the fire, she said:</p>

<p>&quot;Queen's in love with you, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>The words were a genuine shock to his sarcastic
<span class="newpage"><a name="page251" id="page251">[251]</a></span>
and rather embittered and bullying mood. Was
he to believe them? The vibrant, uttering voice
was convincing enough. Was he to show the
conventional incredulity proper to such an
occasion? Or was he to be natural, brutally
natural? He was drawn first to one course and
then to the other, and finally spoke at random, by
instinct:</p>

<p>&quot;What have I been doing to deserve this?&quot;</p>

<p>Concepcion replied, still looking into the fire:
&quot;As far as I can gather it must be your masterful
ways at the Hospital Committee that have
impressed her, and especially your unheard-of
tyrannical methods with her august mother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see.... Thanks!&quot;</p>

<p>It had not occurred to him that he had treated
the Marchioness tyrannically; he treated her like
anybody else; he now perceived that this was to
treat her tyrannically. His imagination leapt forward
as he gazed round the weird and exciting
room which Queen had brought into existence for
the illustration of herself, and as he pictured the
slim, pale figure outside clinging in the night to
the vast chimney, and as he listened to the faint
intermittent thud of far-off guns. He had a
spasm of delicious temptation. He was tempted
by Queen's connections and her prospective
wealth. If anybody was to possess millions after
the war, Queen would one day possess millions.
Her family and her innumerable powerful
relatives would be compelled to accept him without
the slightest reserve, for Queen issued edicts;
and through all those big people he would acquire
immense prestige and influence, which he could
<span class="newpage"><a name="page252" id="page252">[252]</a></span>
use greatly. Ambition flared up in him&mdash;ambition
to impress himself on his era. And he
reflected with satisfaction on the strangeness of
the fact that such an opportunity should have
come to him, the son of a lawyer, solely by virtue
of his own individuality. He thought of Christine,
and poor little Christine was shrunk to nothing
at all; she was scarcely even an object of compassion;
she was a prostitute.</p>

<p>But far more than by Queen's connections and
prospective wealth he was tempted by her youth
and beauty; he saw her beautiful and girlish, and
he was sexually tempted. Most of all he was
tempted by the desire to master her. He saw again
the foolish, elegant, brilliant thing on the chimney
pretending to defy him and mock at him. And he
heard himself commanding sharply: &quot;Come
down. Come down and acknowledge your ruler.
Come down and be whipped.&quot; (For had he not
been told that she would like nothing better?)
And he heard the West End of London and all
the country-houses saying, &quot;She obeys <i>him</i> like
a slave.&quot; He conceived a new and dazzling
environment for himself; and it was undeniable
that he needed something of the kind, for he was
growing lonely; before the war he had lived
intensely in his younger friends, but the war
had taken nearly all of them away from him,
many of them for ever.</p>

<p>Then he said in a voice almost resentfully
satiric, and wondered why such a tone should come
from his lips:</p>

<p>&quot;Another of her caprices, no doubt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean&mdash;another of her caprices?&quot;
said Concepcion, straightening herself and leaning
against the mantelpiece.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page253" id="page253">[253]</a></span>
<p>He had noticed, only a moment earlier, on the
mantelpiece, a large photograph of the handsome
Molder, with some writing under it.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what about that, for example?&quot;</p>

<p>He pointed. Concepcion glanced at him for
the first time, and her eyes followed the direction
of his finger.</p>

<p>&quot;That! I don't know anything about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean to say that while you were
gossiping till five o'clock this morning, you two,
she didn't mention it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She didn't.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. went right on, murmuring:</p>

<p>&quot;Wants to do something unusual. Wants to
astonish the town.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! No!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you seriously tell me she's fallen in love
with me, Con?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't the slightest doubt of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did she say so?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a sound outside the door. They both
started like plotters in danger, and tried to look
as if they had been discussing the weather or the
war. But no interruption occurred.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, she did. I know I shall be thought
mischievous. If she had the faintest notion I'd
breathed the least hint to you, she'd quarrel with
me eternally&mdash;of course. I couldn't bear another
quarrel. If it had been anybody else but you I
wouldn't have said a word. But you're different
from anybody else. And I couldn't help it. You don't
know what Queen is. Queen's a white woman.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page254" id="page254">[254]</a></span>
<p>&quot;So you said this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so she is. She has the most curious and
interesting brain, and she's as straight as a man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've never noticed it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I know. I know. And she's an exquisite
companion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so on and so on. And I expect the
scheme is that I am to make love to her and be
worried out of my life, and then propose to her
and she'll accept me.&quot; The word &quot;scheme&quot;
brought up again his suspicion of a conspiracy.
Evidently there was no conspiracy, but there was
a plot&mdash;of one.... A nervous breakdown? Was
Concepcion merely under an illusion that she had
had a nervous breakdown, or had she in truth had
one, and was this singular interview a result of it?</p>

<p>Concepcion continued with surprising calm
magnanimity:</p>

<p>&quot;I know her mind is strange, but it's lovely. No
one but me has ever seen into it. She's following
her instinct, unconsciously&mdash;as we all do, you know.
And her instinct's right, in spite of everything.
Her instinct's telling her just now that she needs
a master. And that's exactly what she does need.
We must remember she's very young&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; G.J. interrupted, bursting out with a
kind of savagery that he could not explain.
&quot;Yes. She's young, and she finds even my age
spicy. There'd be something quite amusingly
piquant for her in marrying a man nearly thirty
years her senior.&quot;</p>

<p>Concepcion advanced towards him. There she
stood in front of him, quite close to his chair,
gazing down at him in her tight black jersey and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page255" id="page255">[255]</a></span>
short white skirt; she was wearing black stockings
now. Her serious face was perfectly unruffled.
And in her worn face was all her experience; all
the nights and days on the Clyde were in her face;
the scalping of the young Glasgow girl was in her
face, and the failure to endure either in work or
in love. There was complete silence within and
without&mdash;not the echo of an echo of a gun. G.J.
felt as though he were at bay.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>&quot;People like you and Queen don't want to
bother about age. Neither of you has any age.
And I'm not imploring you to have her. I'm only
telling you that she's there for you if you want her.
But doesn't she attract you? Isn't she positively
irresistible?&quot; She added with poignancy: &quot;I
know if I were a man I should find her irresistible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just so.&quot;</p>

<p>A look of sacrifice came into Concepcion's eyes
as she finished:</p>

<p>&quot;I'd do anything, anything, to make Queen
happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, you would,&quot; retorted G.J. icily, carried
away by a ruthless and inexorable impulse.
&quot;You'd do anything to make her happy even for
three months. Yes, to make her happy for three
weeks you'd be ready to ruin my whole life. I
know you and Queen.&quot; And the mild image of
Christine formed in his mind, soothingly, infinitely
desirable. What balm, after the nerve-racking
contact of these incalculable creatures!</p>

<p>Concepcion retired with a gesture of the arm
and sat down by the fire.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page256" id="page256">[256]</a></span>
<p>&quot;You're terrible, G.J.,&quot; she said wistfully.
&quot;Queen wouldn't be thrown away on you, but
you'd be thrown away on her. I admit it. I
didn't think you had it in you. I never saw a man
develop as you have. Marriage isn't for you. You
ought to roam in the primeval forest, and take and
kill.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a bit,&quot; said G.J., appeased once more.
&quot;Not a bit.... But the new relations of the sexes
aren't in my line.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>New</i>? My poor boy, are you so ingenuous
after all? There's nothing very new in the relations
of the sexes that I know of. They're much what
they were in the Garden of Eden.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you know of the Garden of Eden?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I get my information from Milton,&quot; she replied
cheerfully, as though much relieved.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you read <i>Paradise Lost</i>, then, Con?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I read it all through in my lodgings. And it's
really rather good. In fact, the remarks of
Raphael to Adam in the eighth book&mdash;I think it
is&mdash;are still just about the last word on the relations
of the sexes:</p>

&quot;Oft-times nothing profits more<br />
Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right<br />
Well-managed; of that skill the more thou<br />
know'st,<br />
The more she will acknowledge thee her head<br />
<i>And to realities yield all her shows</i>.&quot;<br />

<p>G.J., marvelling, exclaimed with sudden
enthusiasm:</p>

<p>&quot;By Jove! You're an astounding woman, Con.
You do me good!&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page257" id="page257">[257]</a></span>
<p>There was a fresh noise beyond the door, and
the door opened and Robin rushed in, blanched
and hysterical, and with her seemed to rush in
terror.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Madame!&quot; she cried. &quot;As there was no
more firing I went on to the roof, and her
ladyship&mdash;&quot; She covered her face and sobbed.</p>

<p>G.J. jumped up.</p>

<p>&quot;Go and see,&quot; said Concepcion in a blank
voice, not moving. &quot;I can't.... It's the message
straight from Potsdam that's arrived.&quot;</p>

<h4>QUEEN DEAD</h4>
<br />

<p>G.J. emerged from the crowded and malodorous
Coroner's Court with a deep sense of the rigour
and the thoroughness of British justice, and
especially of its stolidity.</p>

<p>There had been four inquests, all upon the
bodies of air-raid victims: a road-man, his wife,
an orphan baby&mdash;all belonging to the thick central
mass of the proletariat, for a West End slum had
received a bomb full in the face&mdash;and Lady
Queenie Paulle. The policemen were stolid; the
reporters were stolid; the proletariat was stolid;
the majority of the witnesses were stolid, and in
particular the representatives of various philanthropic
agencies who gave the most minute
evidence about the habits and circumstances of
the slum; and the jurymen were very stolid, and
never more so than when, with stubby fingers
holding ancient pens, they had to sign quantities
of blue forms under the strict guidance of a bareheaded
policeman.</p>

<p>The world of Queenie's acquaintances made a
strange, vivid contrast to this grey, grim, blockish
world; and the two worlds regarded each other
with the wonder and the suspicious resentment of
foreigners. Queen's world came expecting to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page259" id="page259">[259]</a></span>
behave as at a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre of, for example,
divorce. Its representatives were quite ready to
tolerate unpleasing contacts and long stretches
of tedium in return for some glimpse of the squalid
and the privilege of being able to say that they
had been present at the inquest. But most of them
had arrived rather late, and they had reckoned
without the Coroner, and comparatively few
obtained even admittance.</p>

<p>The Coroner had arrived on the stroke of the
hour, in a silk hat and frock coat, with a black bag,
and had sat down at his desk and begun to rule
the proceedings with an absolutism that no High
Court Judge would have attempted. He was
autocrat in a small, close, sordid room; but he was
autocrat. He had already shown his quality in
some indirect collisions with the Marquis of Lechford.
The Marquis felt that he could not stomach
the exposure of his daughter's corpse in a common
mortuary with other corpses of he knew not whom.
Long experience of the marquisate had taught him
to believe that everything could be arranged. He
found, however, that this matter could not be
arranged. There was no appeal from the ukase of
the Coroner. Then he wished to be excused from
giving evidence, since his evidence could have no
direct bearing on the death. But he was informed
by a mere clerk, who had knowledge of the
Coroner's ways, that if he did not attend the
inquest would probably be adjourned for his
attendance. The fact was, the Coroner had
appreciated as well as anybody that heaven and
the war had sent him a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre of the
first-class. He saw himself the supreme being of a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page260" id="page260">[260]</a></span>
unique assize. He saw his remarks reproduced
verbatim in the papers, for, though localities
might not be mentioned, there was no censor's
ban upon the <i>obiter dicta</i> of coroners. His
idiosyncrasy was that he hid all his enjoyment in
his own breast. Even had he had the use of a
bench, instead of a mere chair, he would never
have allowed titled ladies in mirific black hats to
share it with him. He was an icy radical, sincere,
competent, conscientious and vain. He would be
no respecter of persons, but he was a disrespecter
of persons above a certain social rank. He said,
&quot;Open that window.&quot; And that window was
opened, regardless of the identity of the person
who might be sitting under it. He said: &quot;This
court is unhealthily full. Admit no more.&quot; And
no more could be admitted, though the entire
peerage waited without.</p>

<p>The Marquis had considered that the inquest on
his daughter might be taken first. The other three
cases were taken first, and, even taken concurrently,
they occupied an immense period of time.
All the bodies were, of course, &quot;viewed&quot; together,
and the absence of the jury seemed to the Marquis
interminable; he thought the despicable tradesmen
were gloating unduly over the damaged face
of his daughter. The Coroner had been marvellously
courteous to the procession of humble
witnesses. He could not have been more courteous
to the exalted; and he was not. In the sight of the
Coroner all men were equal.</p>

<p>G.J. encountered him first. &quot;I did my best
to persuade her ladyship to come down,&quot; said
G.J. very formally. &quot;I am quite sure you did,&quot;
<span class="newpage"><a name="page261" id="page261">[261]</a></span>
said the Coroner with the dryest politeness. &quot;And
you failed.&quot; The policeman had related events
from the moment when G.J. had fetched him in
from the street. The policeman could remember
everything, what everybody had said, the positions
of all objects, the characteristics and extent of the
wire-netting, the exact posture of the deceased
girl, the exact minute of his visit. He and the
Coroner played to each other like well-rehearsed
actors. Mrs. Carlos Smith's ordeal was very brief,
and the Coroner dismissed her with an expression
of sympathy that seemed to issue from his mouth
like carved granite. With the doctor alone the
Coroner had become human; the Coroner also
was a doctor. The doctor had talked about a
relatively slight extravasation of blood, and said
that death had been instantaneous. Said the
Coroner: &quot;The body was found on the wire-netting;
it had fallen from the chimney. In your
opinion, was the fall a contributory cause of
death?&quot; The doctor said, No. &quot;In your opinion
death was due to an extremely small piece of
shrapnel which struck the deceased's head slightly
above the left ear, entering the brain?&quot; The
doctor said, Yes.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Lechford had to answer questions
as to his parental relations with his daughter.
How long had he been away in the country? How
long had the deceased been living in Lechford
House practically alone? How old was his
daughter? Had he given any order to the effect
that nobody was to be on the roof of his house
during an air-raid? Had he given any orders at
all as to conduct during an air-raid? The Coroner
<span class="newpage"><a name="page262" id="page262">[262]</a></span>
sympathised deeply with his lordship's position,
and felt sure that his lordship understood that;
but his lordship would also understand that the
policy of heads of households in regard to air-raids
had more than a domestic interest&mdash;it had, one
might say, a national interest; and the force of
prominent example was one of the forces upon
which the Government counted, and had the
right to count, for help in the regulation of public
conduct in these great crises of the most gigantic
war that the world had ever seen. &quot;Now, as to the
wire-netting,&quot; had said the Coroner, leaving the
subject of the force of example. He had a perfect
plan of the wire-netting in his mind. He understood
that the chimney-stack rose higher than the
wire-netting, and that the wire-netting went
round the chimney-stack at a distance of a foot or
more, leaving room so that a person might climb
up the perpendicular ladder. If a person fell from
the top of the chimney-stack it was a chance
whether that person fell on the wire-netting, or
through the space between the wire-netting and the
chimney on to the roof itself. The jury doubtless
understood. (The jury, however, at that instant
had been engaged in examining the bit of shrapnel
which had been extracted from the brain of the
only daughter of a Marquis.) The Coroner understood
that the wire-netting did not extend over the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page263" id="page263">[263]</a></span>
whole of the house. &quot;It extends over all the main
part of the house,&quot; his lordship had replied. &quot;But
not over the back part of the house?&quot; His lordship
agreed. &quot;The servants' quarters, probably?&quot;
His lordship nodded. The Coroner had said:
&quot;The wire-netting does not extend over the
servants' quarters,&quot; in a very even voice. A faint
hiss in court had been extinguished by the sharp
glare of the Coroner's eyes. His lordship, a thin,
antique figure, in a long cloak that none but himself
would have ventured to wear, had stepped
down, helpless.</p>

<p>There had been much signing of depositions.
The Coroner had spoken of The Hague Convention,
mentioning one article by its number. The
jury as to the first three cases&mdash;in which the victims
had been killed by bombs&mdash;had returned a
verdict of wilful murder against the Kaiser. The
Coroner, suppressing the applause, had agreed
heartily with the verdict. He told the jury that the
fourth case was different, and the jury returned a
verdict of death from shrapnel. They gave their
sympathy to all the relatives, and added a rider
about the inadvisability of running unnecessary
risks, and the Coroner, once more agreeing
heartily, had thereon made an effective little
speech to a hushed, assenting audience.</p>

<p>There were several motor-cars outside. G.J.
signalled across the street to the taxi-man who
telephoned every morning to him for orders. He
had never owned a motor-car, and, because he had
no ambition to drive himself, had never felt the
desire to own one. The taxi-man experienced
some delay in starting his engine. G.J. lit a
cigarette. Concepcion came out, alone. He had
expected her to be with the Marquis, with whom
she had arrived. She was dressed in mourning.
Only on that day, and once before&mdash;on the day of
her husband's funeral&mdash;had he seen her in mourning.
She looked now like the widow she was.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page264" id="page264">[264]</a></span>
<p>Nevertheless, he had not quite accustomed himself
to the sight of her in mourning.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder whether I can get a taxi?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;You can have mine,&quot; said he. &quot;Where do
you want to go?&quot;</p>

<p>She named a disconcerting address near
Shepherd's Market.</p>

<p>At that moment a Pressman with a camera
came boldly up and snapped her. The man had
the brazen demeanour of a racecourse tout. But
Concepcion seemed not to mind at all, and G.J.
remembered that she was deeply inured to
publicity. Her portrait had already appeared in
the picture papers along with that of Queen, but
the papers had deemed it necessary to remind a
forgetful public that Mrs. Carlos Smith was the
same lady as the super-celebrated Concepcion
Iquist. The taxi-man hesitated for an instant on
hearing the address, but only for an instant. He
had earned the esteem and regular patronage of
G.J. by a curious hazard. One night G.J. had
hailed him, and the man had said in a flash,
without waiting for the fare to speak, &quot;The
Albany, isn't it, sir? I drove you home about two
months ago.&quot; Thenceforward he had been for
G.J. the perfect taxi-man.</p>

<p>In the taxi Concepcion said not a word, and
G.J. did not disturb her. Beneath his superficial
melancholy he was sustained by the mere joy of
being alive. The common phenomena of the
streets were beautiful to him. Concepcion's calm
and grieved vitality seemed mysteriously exquisite.
He had had similar sensations while walking along
Coventry Street after his escape from the explosion
<span class="newpage"><a name="page265" id="page265">[265]</a></span>
of the bomb. Fatigue and annoyance and sorrow
had extinguished them for a time, but now that
the episode of Queen's tragedy was closed
they were born anew. Queen, the pathetic victim
of the indiscipline of her own impulses, was gone.
But he had escaped. He lived. And life was an
affair miraculous and lovely.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I've been here before,&quot; said he,
when they got out of the taxi in a short, untidy,
indeterminate street that was a cul-de-sac. The
prospect ended in a garage, near which two women
chauffeurs were discussing a topic that interested
them. A hurdy-gurdy was playing close by, and
a few ragged children stared at the hurdy-gurdy,
on the end of which a baby was cradled. The fact
that the street was midway between Curzon Street
and Piccadilly, and almost within sight of the
monumental new mansion of an American duchess,
explained the existence of the building in front
of which the taxi had stopped. The entrance to
the flats was mean and soiled. It repelled, but
Concepcion unapologetically led G.J. up a flight
of four stone steps and round a curve into a little
corridor. She halted at a door on the ground floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said G.J. with admirable calm, &quot;I
do believe you've got the very flat I once looked
at with a friend of mine. If I remember it didn't
fill the bill because the tenant wouldn't sub-let it
unfurnished. When did you get hold of this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yesterday afternoon,&quot; Concepcion answered.
&quot;Quick work. But these feats can be accomplished.
I've only taken it for a month. Hotels seem to be
all full. I couldn't open my own place at a
moment's notice, and I didn't mean to stay on
<span class="newpage"><a name="page266" id="page266">[266]</a></span>
at Lechford House, even if they'd asked me to.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J.'s notion of the vastness and safety of
London had received a shock. He was now a very
busy man, and would quite sincerely have told
anybody who questioned him on the point that he
hadn't a moment to call his own. Nevertheless,
on the previous morning he had spent a considerable
time in searching for a nest in which to hide
his Christine and create romance; and he had
come to this very flat. More, there had been two
flats to let in the block. He had declined them&mdash;the
better one because of the furniture, the worse
because it was impossibly small, and both because
of the propinquity of the garage. But supposing
that he had taken one and Concepcion the other!
He recoiled at the thought....</p>

<p>Concepcion's new home, if not impossibly small,
was small, and the immensity and abundance of
the furniture made it seem smaller than it actually
was. Each little room had the air of having been
furnished out of a huge and expensive second-hand
emporium. No single style prevailed. There
were big carved and inlaid antique cabinets and
chests, big hanging crystal candelabra, and big
pictures (some of them apparently family portraits,
the rest eighteenth-century flower-pieces) in big
gilt frames, with a multiplicity of occasional tables
and bric-&agrave;-brac. Gilt predominated. The ornate
cornices were gilded. Human beings had to move
about like dwarfs on the tiny free spaces of carpet
between frowning cabinetry. The taste and the
aim of the author of this home defied deduction.
In the first room a charwoman was cleaning.
Concepcion greeted her like a sister. In the next
<span class="newpage"><a name="page267" id="page267">[267]</a></span>
room, whose window gave on to a blank wall,
tea was laid for one in front of a gas-fire. Concepcion
reached down a cup and saucer from a
glazed cupboard and put a match to the spirit-lamp
under the kettle.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me see, the bedroom's up here, isn't it?&quot;
said G.J., pointing along a passage that was like
a tunnel.</p>

<p>Concepcion, yielding to his curiosity, turned
on lights everywhere and preceded him. The
passage, hung with massive canvases, had scarcely
more than width enough for G.J.'s shoulders.
The tiny bedroom was muslined in every conceivable
manner. It had a colossal bed, surpassing
even Christine's. A muslined maid was bending
over some drapery-shop boxes on the floor and
removing garments therefrom. Concepcion
greeted her like a sister. &quot;Don't let me disturb
you, Emily,&quot; she said, and to G.J., &quot;Emily was
poor Queenie's maid, and she has come to me for
a little while.&quot; G.J. amicably nodded. Tears
came suddenly into the maid's eyes. G.J. looked
away and saw the bathroom, which, also well
muslined, was completely open to the bedroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Whose <i>is</i> this marvellous home?&quot; he added
when they had gone back to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&quot;I think the original tenant is the wife of
somebody who's interned.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How simple the explanation is!&quot; said G.J.
&quot;But I should never have guessed it.&quot;</p>

<p>They started the tea in a strange silence. After
a minute or two G.J. said:</p>

<p>&quot;I mustn't stay long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Neither must I.&quot; Concepcion smiled.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page268" id="page268">[268]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Got to go out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>There was another silence. Then Concepcion
said:</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to Sarah Churcher's. And as I
know she has her Pageant Committee at five-thirty,
I'd better not arrive later than five,
had I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is there between you and Lady
Churcher?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'm going to offer to take Queen's place
on the organising Committee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Con!&quot; he exclaimed impulsively, &quot;you aren't?&quot;</p>

<p>In an instant the atmosphere of the little airless,
electric-lit, gas-fumed apartment was charged
with a fluid that no physical chemistry could have
traced. Concepcion said mildly:</p>

<p>&quot;I am. I owe it to Queen's memory to take her
place if I can. Of course I'm no dancer, but in
other things I expect I can make myself useful.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. replied with equal mildness:</p>

<p>&quot;You aren't going to mix yourself up with that
crowd again&mdash;after all you've been through!
The Pageant business isn't good enough for you,
Con, and you know it. You know it's odious.&quot;</p>

<p>She murmured:</p>

<p>&quot;I feel it's my duty. I feel I owe it to Queen.
It's a sort of religion with me, I expect. Each
person has his own religion, and I doubt if one's
more dogmatic than another.&quot;</p>

<p>He was grieved; he had a sense almost of outrage.
He hated to picture Concepcion subduing
herself to the horrible environment of the Pageant
enterprise. But he said nothing more. The
<span class="newpage"><a name="page269" id="page269">[269]</a></span>
silence resumed. They might have conversed,
with care, about the inquest, or about the funeral,
which was to take place at the Castle, in Cheshire.
Silence, however, suited them best.</p>

<p>&quot;Also I thought you needed repose,&quot; said
G.J. when Concepcion broke the melancholy
enchantment by rising to look for cigarettes.</p>

<p>&quot;I must be allowed to work,&quot; she answered
after a pause, putting a cigarette between her
teeth. &quot;I must have something to do&mdash;unless,
of course, you want me to go to the bad altogether.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a remarkable saying, but it seemed to
admit that he was legitimately entitled to his
critical interest in her.</p>

<p>&quot;If I'd known that,&quot; he said, suddenly inspired,
&quot;I should have asked you to take on something
for <i>me</i>.&quot; He waited; she made no response, and
he continued: &quot;I'm secretary of my small affair
since yesterday. The paid secretary, a nice
enough little thing, has just run off to the Women's
Auxiliary Corps in France and left me utterly in
the lurch. Just like domestic servants, these
earnest girl-clerks are, when it comes to the
point! No imagination. Wanted to wear khaki,
and no doubt thought she was doing a splendid
thing. Never occurred to her the mess I should
be in. I'd have asked you to step into the breach.
You'd have been frightfully useful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I'm no girl-clerk,&quot; Concepcion gently and
carelessly protested.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, she wasn't either. I shouldn't have
wanted you to be a typist. We have a typist. As
a matter of fact, her job needed a bit more brains
than she'd got. However&mdash;&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page270" id="page270">[270]</a></span>
<p>Another silence. G.J. rose to depart. Concepcion
did not stir. She said softly:</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think anybody realises what Queen's
death is to me. Not even you.&quot; On her face was
the look of sacrifice which G.J. had seen there as
they talked together in Queen's boudoir during
the raid.</p>

<p>He thought, amazed:</p>

<p>&quot;And they'd only had about twenty-four
hours together, and part of that must have been
spent in making up their quarrel!&quot;</p>

<p>Then aloud:</p>

<p>&quot;I quite agree. People can't realise what they
haven't had to go through. I've understood that
ever since I read in the paper the day before
yesterday that 'two bombs fell close together and
one immediately after the other' in a certain
quarter of the West End. That was all the paper
said about those two bombs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why! What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I understood it when poor old Queen
gave me some similar information on the roof.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What <i>do</i> you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was between those two bombs when they
fell. One of 'em blew me against a house. I've
been to look at the place since. And I'm dashed
if I myself could realise then what I'd been
through.&quot;</p>

<p>She gave a little cry. Her face pleased him.</p>

<p>&quot;And you weren't hurt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had a pain in my side, but it's gone,&quot; he said
laconically.</p>

<p>&quot;And you never said anything to us! Why
not?&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page271" id="page271">[271]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Well&mdash;there were so many other things....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;G.J., you're astounding!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm not. I'm just myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And hasn't it upset your nerves?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not as far as I can judge. Of course one never
knows, but I think not. What do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>She offered no response. At length she spoke
with queer emotion:</p>

<p>&quot;You remember that night I said it was a
message direct from Potsdam? Well, naturally
it wasn't. But do you know the thought that
tortures me? Supposing the shrapnel that killed
Queen was out of a shell made at my place in
Glasgow!... It might have been.... Supposing
it was!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Con,&quot; he said firmly, &quot;I simply won't listen
to that kind of talk. There's no excuse for it.
Shall I tell you what, more than anything else,
has made me respect you since Queen was killed?
Ninety-nine women out of a hundred would have
managed to remind me, quite illogically and quite
inexcusably, that I was saying hard things about
poor old Queen at the very moment when she was
lying dead on the roof. You didn't. You knew
I was very sorry about Queen, but you knew that
my feelings as to her death had nothing whatever
to do with what I happened to be saying when she
was killed. You knew the difference between
sentiment and sentimentality. For God's sake,
don't start wondering where the shell was made.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked up at him, saying nothing, and he
savoured the intelligence of her weary, fine, alert,
comprehending face. He did not pretend to himself
to be able to fathom the enigmas of that long
<span class="newpage"><a name="page272" id="page272">[272]</a></span>
glance. He had again the feeling of the splendour
of what it was to be alive, to have survived. Just
as he was leaving she said casually:</p>

<p>&quot;Very well. I'll do what you want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What I want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I won't go to Sarah Churcher's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean you'll come as assistant secretary?&quot;</p>

<p>She nodded. &quot;Only I don't need to be paid.&quot;</p>

<p>And he, too, fell into a casual tone:</p>

<p>&quot;That's excellent.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus, by this nonchalance, they conspired to
hide from themselves the seriousness of that which
had passed between them. The grotesque, pretentious
little apartment was mysteriously humanised;
it was no longer the reception-room of a
furnished flat by chance hired for a month; they
had lived in it.</p>

<p>She finished, eagerly smiling:</p>

<p>&quot;I can practise my religion just as much with
you as with Sarah Churcher, can't I? Queen was
on your committee, too. Yes, I shan't be deserting
her.&quot;</p>

<p>The remark disquieted his triumph. That
aspect of the matter had not occurred to him.</p>

<h4>COLLAPSE</h4>
<br />

<p>Late of that same afternoon G.J., in the absence
of the chairman, presided as honorary secretary
over a meeting of the executive committee of the
Lechford hospitals. In the course of the war the
committee had changed its habitation more than
once. The hotel which had at first given it a
home had long ago been commandeered by the
Government for a new Government department,
and its hundreds of chambers were now full of the
clicking of typewriters and the dictation of
officially phrased correspondence, and the conferences
which precede decisions, and the untamed
footsteps of messenger-flappers, and the making of
tea, and chatter about cinemas, blouses and
headaches. Afterwards the committee had been
the guest of a bank and of a trust company, and
had for a period even paid rent to a common
landlord. But its object was always to escape
the formality of rent-paying, and it was now
lodged in an untenanted mansion belonging
to a viscount in a great Belgravian square.
Its sign was spread high across the facade; its
posters were in the windows; and on the door
was a notice such as in 1914 nobody had ever
expected to see in that quadrangle of guarded
<span class="newpage"><a name="page274" id="page274">[274]</a></span>
sacred castles: &quot;Turn the handle and walk in.&quot;
The mansion, though much later in date, was
built precisely on the lines of a typical Bloomsbury
boarding-house. It had the same basement, the
same general disposition of rooms, the same
abundance of stairs and paucity of baths, the same
chilly draughts and primeval devices for heating,
and the same superb disregard for the convenience
of servants. The patrons of domestic architecture
had permitted architects to learn nothing in
seventy years except that chimney-flues must be
constructed so that they could be cleaned without
exposing sooty infants to the danger of suffocation
or incineration.</p>

<p>The committee sat on the first floor in the back
drawing-room, whose furniture consisted of a deal
table, Windsor chairs, a row of hat-pegs, a wooden
box containing coal, half a poker, two unshaded
lights; the walls, from which all the paper had
been torn off, were decorated with lists of
sub-committees, posters, and rows of figures scrawled
here and there in pencil. The room was divided
from the main drawing-room by the usual folding-doors.
The smaller apartment had been chosen in
the winter because it was somewhat easier to keep
warm than the other one. In the main drawing-room
the honorary secretary camped himself at a
desk near the fireplace.</p>

<p>When the clock struck, G.J., one of whose
monastic weaknesses was a ritualistic regard for
punctuality, was in his place at the head of the
table, and the table well filled with members, for
the honorary secretary's harmless foible was known
and admitted. The table and the chairs, the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page275" id="page275">[275]</a></span>
scraping of the chair-legs on the bare floor, the
agenda papers and the ornamentation thereof by
absent-minded pens, were the same as in the
committee's youth. But the personnel of the
committee had greatly changed, and it was
enlarged&mdash;as its scope had been enlarged. The
two Lechford hospitals behind the French lines
were now only a part of the committee's responsibilities.
It had a special hospital in Paris, two
convalescent homes in England, and an important
medical unit somewhere in Italy. Finance was
becoming its chief anxiety, for the reason that,
though soldiers had not abandoned in disgust
the practice of being wounded, philanthropists
were unquestionably showing signs of fatigue. It
had collected money by postal appeals, by
advertisements, by selling flags, by competing
with drapers' shops, by intimidation, by ruse and
guile, and by all the other recognised methods.
Of late it had depended largely upon the very
wealthy, and, to a less extent, upon G.J., who
having gradually constituted the committee his
hobby, had contributed some thousands of pounds
from his share of the magic profits of the Reveille
Company. Everybody was aware of the immense
importance of G.J.'s help. G.J. never showed
it in his demeanour, but the others continually
showed it in theirs. He had acquired authority.
He had also acquired the sure manner of one
accustomed to preside.</p>

<p>&quot;Before we begin on the agenda,&quot; he said&mdash;and
as he spoke a late member crept apologetically
in and tiptoed to the heavily charged hat-pegs&mdash;&quot;I
would like to mention about Miss Trewas.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page276" id="page276">[276]</a></span>
Some of you know that through an admirable but
somewhat disordered sense of patriotism she has
left us at a moment's notice. I am glad to say
that my friend Mrs. Carlos Smith, who, I may tell
you, has had a very considerable experience of
organisation, has very kindly agreed, subject of
course to the approval of the committee, to step
temporarily into the breach. She will be an
honorary worker, like all of us here, and I am sure
that the committee will feel as grateful to her as
I do.&quot;</p>

<p>As there had been smiles at the turn of his
phrase about Miss Trewas, so now there were
fervent, almost emotional, &quot;Hear-hears.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Smith, will you please read the minutes
of the last meeting.&quot;</p>

<p>Concepcion was sitting at his left hand. He
kept thinking, &quot;I'm one of those who get things
done.&quot; Two hours ago, and the idea of enlisting
her had not even occurred to him, and already he
had taken her out of her burrow, brought her to
the offices, coached her in the preliminaries of her
allotted task, and introduced several important
members of the committee to her! It was an
achievement.</p>

<p>Never had the minutes been listened to with
such attention as they obtained that day. Concepcion
was apparently not in the least nervous,
and she read very well&mdash;far better than the
deserter Miss Trewas, who could not open her
mouth without bridling. Concepcion held the
room. Those who had not seen before the
celebrated Concepcion Iquist now saw her and
sated their eyes upon her. She had been less a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page277" id="page277">[277]</a></span>
woman than a legend. The romance of South
America enveloped her, and the romance of her
famous and notorious uncle, of her triumph over
the West End, her startling marriage and swift
widowing, her journey to America and her
complete disappearance, her attachment to Lady
Queenie, and now her dramatic reappearance.</p>

<p>And the sharp condiment to all this was the
general knowledge of the bachelor G.J.'s long
intimacy with her, and of their having both been
at Lechford House on the night of the raid, and
both been at the inquest on the body of Lady
Queenie Paulle on that very day. But nobody
could have guessed from their placid and self-possessed
demeanour that either of them had just
emerged from a series of ordeals. They won a deep
and full respect. Still, some people ventured to
have their own ideas; and an ingenuous few were
surprised to find that the legend was only a woman
after all, and a rather worn woman, not indeed
very recognisable from her innumerable portraits.
Nevertheless the respect for the pair was even
increased when G.J. broached the first item on
the agenda&mdash;a resolution of respectful sympathy
with the Marquis and Marchioness of Lechford in
their bereavement, of profound appreciation of the
services of Lady Queenie on the committee, and
of an intention to send by the chairman to the
funeral a wreath to be subscribed for by the
members. G.J. proposed the resolution himself,
and it was seconded by a lady and supported by a
gentleman whose speeches gave no hint that Lady
Queenie had again and again by her caprices
nearly driven the entire committee into a lunatic
<span class="newpage"><a name="page278" id="page278">[278]</a></span>
asylum and had caused several individual resignations.
G.J. put the resolution without a tremor;
it was impressively carried; and Concepcion wrote
down the terms of it quite calmly in her secretarial
notes. The performance of the pair was marvellous,
and worthy of the English race.</p>

<p>Then arrived Sir Stephen Bradern. Sir
Stephen was chairman of the French Hospitals
Management Sub-committee.</p>

<p>G.J. said:</p>

<p>&quot;Sir Stephen, you are just too late for the
resolution as to Lady Queenie Paulle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I deeply apologise, Mr. Chairman,&quot; replied
the aged but active Sir Stephen, nervously stroking
his rather long beard. &quot;I hope, however, that I
may be allowed to associate myself very closely
with the resolution.&quot; After a suitable pause and
general silence he went on: &quot;I've been detained
by that Nurse Smaith that my sub-committee's
been having trouble with. You'll find, when you
come to them, that she's on my sub-committee's
minutes. I've just had an interview with her, and
she says she wants to see the executive. I don't
know what you think, Mr. Chairman&mdash;&quot; He
stopped.</p>

<p>G.J. smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;I should have her brought in,&quot; said the lady
who had previously spoken. &quot;If I might suggest,&quot;
she added.</p>

<p>A boy scout, who seemed to have long ago
grown out of his uniform, entered with a note for
somebody. He was told to bring in Nurse Smaith.</p>

<p>She proved to be a rather short and rather
podgy woman, with a reddish, not rosy, complexion,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page279" id="page279">[279]</a></span>
and red hair. The ugly red-bordered cape
of the British Red Cross did not suit her better
than it suited any other wearer. She was in full,
strict, starched uniform, and prominently wore
medals on her plenteous breast. She looked as
though, if she had a sister, that sister might be
employed in a large draper's shop at Brixton or
Islington. In saying &quot;Gid ahfternoon&quot; she
revealed the purity of a cockney accent undefiled
by Continental experiences. She sat down in a
manner sternly defensive. She was nervous and
abashed, but evidently dangerous. She belonged
to the type which is courageous in spite of fear.
She had resolved to interview the committee, and
though the ordeal frightened her, she desperately
and triumphantly welcomed it.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Nurse Smaith,&quot; said G.J. diplomatically.
&quot;We are always very glad to see our nurses, even
when our time is limited. Will you kindly tell the
committee as briefly as possible just what your
claim is?&quot;</p>

<p>And the nurse replied, with medals shaking:</p>

<p>&quot;I'm claiming, as I've said before, two weeks'
salary in loo of notice, and my fare home from
France; twenty-five francs salary and ninety-five
francs expenses. And I sy nothing of excess
luggage.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you didn't <i>come</i> home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have come home, though.&quot;</p>

<p>One of those members whose destiny it is
always to put a committee in the wrong remarked:</p>

<p>&quot;But surely, Nurse, you left our employ nearly
a year ago. Why didn't you claim before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been at you for two months at least, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page280" id="page280">[280]</a></span>
I was ill for six months in Turin; they had to put
me off the train there,&quot; said Nurse Smaith,
getting self-confidence.</p>

<p>&quot;As I understand,&quot; said G.J. &quot;You left us in
order to join a Serbian unit of another society,
and you only returned to England in February.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't leave you, sir. That is, I mean, I
left you, but I was told to go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who told you to go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Matron.&quot;</p>

<p>Sir Stephen benevolently put in:</p>

<p>&quot;But the matron had always informed us that
it was you who said you wouldn't stay another
minute. We have it in the correspondence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what <i>she</i> says. But I say different. And
I can prove it.&quot;</p>

<p>Said G.J.:</p>

<p>&quot;There must be some misunderstanding. We
have every confidence in the matron, and she's
still with us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I'm sorry for you.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned warily to another aspect of the
subject.</p>

<p>&quot;Do I gather that you went straight from Paris
to Serbia?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. The unit was passing through, and I
joined it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But how did you obtain your passport? You
had no certificate from us?&quot;</p>

<p>Nurse Smaith tossed her perilous red hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! No difficulty about that. I am not
<i>without</i> friends, as you may say.&quot; Some of the
committee looked up suspiciously, aware that the
matron had in her report hinted at mysterious
<span class="newpage"><a name="page281" id="page281">[281]</a></span>
relations between Nurse Smaith and certain
authorities. &quot;The doctor in charge of the Serbian
unit was only too glad to have me. Of course,
if you're going to believe everything matron
says&mdash;&quot; Her tone was becoming coarser, but
the committee could neither turn her out nor cure
her natural coarseness, nor indicate to her that she
was not using the demeanour of committee-rooms.
She was firmly lodged among them, and she went
from bad to worse. &quot;Of course, if you're going
to swallow everything matron says&mdash;! It isn't
as if I was the only one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May I ask if you are at present employed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't <i>quite</i> see what that's got to do with it,&quot;
said Nurse Smaith, still gaining ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly not. Nothing. Nothing at all. I was
only hoping that these visits here are not
inconvenient to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, as it seems so important, I <i>my</i> sy I'm
going out to Salonika next week, and that's why
I want this business settled.&quot; She stopped, and as
the committee remained diffidently and apprehensively
silent, she went on: &quot;It isn't as if I was
the only one. Why! When we were in the retreat
of the Serbian Army owver the mahntains I came
across by chance, if you call it chance, another
nurse that knew all about <i>her</i>&mdash;been under her
in Bristol for a year.&quot;</p>

<p>A young member, pricking up, asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Were you in the Serbian retreat, Nurse?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I hadn't been I shouldn't be here now,&quot; said
Nurse Smaith, entirely recovered from her stage-fright
and entirely pleased to be there then. &quot;I
lost all I had at Ypek. All I took was my medals,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page282" id="page282">[282]</a></span>
and them I did take. There were fifty of us,
British, French and Russians. We had nearly
three weeks in the mahntains. We slept rough all
together in one room, when there was a room,
and when there wasn't we slept in stables. We
had nothing but black bread, and that froze in the
haversacks, and if we took our boots off we had to
thaw them the next morning before we could put
them on. If we hadn't had three saucepans we
should have died. When we went dahn the hills
two of us had to hold every horse by his head and
tail to keep them from falling. However, nearly
all the horses died, and then we took the packs off
them and tried to drag the packs along by hand;
but we soon stopped that. All the bridle-paths
were littered with dead horses and oxen. And
when we came up with the Serbian Army we saw
soldiers just drop down and die in the snow. I
read in the paper there were no children in the
retreat, but I saw lots of children, strapped to their
mother's backs. Yes; and they fell down together
and froze to death. Then we got to Scutari, and
glad I was.&quot;</p>

<p>She glanced round defiantly, but not otherwise
moved, at the committee, the hitherto invisible
gods of hospitals and medical units. The nipping
wind of reality had blown into the back drawing-room.
The committee was daunted. But some of
its members, less daunted than the rest, had the
presence of mind to wonder why it seemed strange
and strangely chilling that a rather coarse, stout
woman with a cockney accent and little social
refinement should have passed through, and
emerged so successfully from, the unimaginable
<span class="newpage"><a name="page283" id="page283">[283]</a></span>
retreat. If Nurse Smaith had been beautiful and
slim and of elegant manners they could not have
controlled their chivalrous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&quot;Very interesting,&quot; said someone.</p>

<p>Glancing at G.J., Nurse Smaith proceeded:</p>

<p>&quot;You sy I didn't come home. But the money
for my journey was due to me. That's what I sy.
Twenty-five francs for two weeks' wages and
ninety-five francs journey money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As regards the journey money,&quot; observed
Sir Stephen blandly, &quot;we've never paid so much,
if my recollection serves me. And of course we
have to remember that we're dealing with public
funds.&quot;</p>

<p>Nurse Smaith sprang up, looking fixedly at
Concepcion. Concepcion had thrown herself back
in her chair, and her face was so drawn that it
was no more the same face.</p>

<p>&quot;Even if it is public funds,&quot; Concepcion
shrieked, &quot;can't you give ninety-five francs in
memory of those three saucepans?&quot; Then she
relapsed on to the table, her head in her hands,
and sobbed violently, very violently. The sobs
rose and fell in the scale, and the whole body
quaked.</p>

<p>G.J. jumped to his feet. Half the shocked and
alarmed committee was on its feet. Nurse Smaith
had run round to Concepcion and had seized her
with a persuasive, soothing gesture. Concepcion
quite submissively allowed herself to be led out
of the room by Nurse Smaith and Sir Stephen.
Her sobs weakened, and when the door was closed
could no longer be heard. A lady member had
followed the three. The committee was positively
<span class="newpage"><a name="page284" id="page284">[284]</a></span>
staggered by the unprecedented affair. G.J.,
very pale, said:</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Smith is in competent hands. We can't
do anything. I think we had better sit down.&quot; He
was obeyed.</p>

<p>A second doctor on the committee remarked
with a curious slight smile:</p>

<p>&quot;I said to myself when I first saw her this afternoon
that Mrs. Smith had some of the symptoms
of a nervous breakdown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; G.J. concurred. &quot;I very much regret
that I allowed Mrs. Smith to come. But she was
determined to work, and she seemed perfectly
calm and collected. I very much regret it.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, to hide his constraint, he pulled towards
him the sheet of paper on which Concepcion had
been making notes, and, remembering that a list
of members present had always to be kept, he
began to write down names. He was extremely
angry with himself. He had tried Concepcion too
high. He ought to have known that all women
were the same. He had behaved like an impulsive
fool. He had been ridiculous before the committee.
What should have been a triumph was a
disaster. The committee would bind their two
names together. And at the conclusion of the
meeting news of the affairs would radiate from the
committee's offices in every direction throughout
London. And he had been unfair to Concepcion.
Their relations would be endlessly complicated
by the episode. He foresaw trying scenes, in
which she would make all the excuses, between
her and himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps it would be simpler if we decided to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page285" id="page285">[285]</a></span>
admit Nurse Smaith's claim,&quot; said a timid voice
from the other end of the table.</p>

<p>G.J. murmured coldly, gazing at the agenda
paper and yet dominating his committee:</p>

<p>&quot;The question will come up on the minutes of
the Hospitals Management Sub-committee. We
had better deal with it then. The next business on
the agenda is the letter from the Paris Service de
Sant&eacute;.&quot;</p>

<p>He was thinking: &quot;How is she now? Ought
I to go out and see?&quot; And the majority of the
committee was vaguely thinking, not without a
certain pleasurable malice: &quot;These Society women!
They're all queer!&quot;</p>

<h4>THE INVISIBLE POWERS</h4>
<br />

<p>Several times already the rumour had spread
in the Promenade that the Promenade would be
closed on a certain date, and the Promenade had
not been closed. But to-night it was stated that the
Promenade would be closed at the end of the week,
and everybody concerned knew that the prophecy
would come true. No official notice was issued, no
person who repeated the tale could give a reliable
authority for it; nevertheless, for some mysterious
reason it convinced. The rival Promenade had
already passed away. The high invisible powers
who ruled the world of pleasure were moving at
the behest of powers still higher than themselves;
and the cloak-room attendants, in their frivolous
tiny aprons, shared murmuringly behind plush
porti&egrave;res in the woe of the ladies with large hats.</p>

<p>The revue being a failure, the auditorium was
more than half empty. In the Promenade to each
man there were at least five pretty ladies, and the
ladies looked gloomily across many rows of vacant
seats at the bright proscenium where jocularities
of an exacerbating tedium were being enacted.
Not that the jocularities were inane beyond the
usual, but failure made them seem so. None had
the slightest idea why the revue had failed; for
<span class="newpage"><a name="page287" id="page287">[287]</a></span>
precisely similar revues, concocted according to
the same recipe and full of the same jocularities
executed by the same players at the same salaries,
had crowded the theatre for many months together.
It was an incomprehensible universe.</p>

<p>Christine suddenly shrugged her shoulders and
walked out. What use in staying to the end?</p>

<p>It was long after ten o'clock, and an exquisite
faint light lingering in the sky still revealed the
features of the people in the streets. The man who
had devoted half a life to the ingenious project
of lengthening the summer days by altering clocks
was in his disappointed grave; but victory had
come to him there, for statesmen had at last proved
the possibility of that which they had always
maintained to be impossible, and the wisdom of
that which they had always maintained to be
idiotic. The voluptuous divine melancholy of
evening June descended upon the city from the
sky, and even sounds were beautifully sad. The
happy progress of the war could not exorcise this
soft, omnipotent melancholy. Yet the progress of
the war was nearly all that could be desired.
Verdun was held, and if Fort Vaux had been lost
there had been compensation in the fact that the
enemy, through the gesture of the Crown Prince
in allowing the captured commander of the fort
to retain his sword, had done something to
rehabilitate themselves in the esteem of mankind.
Lord Kitchener was drowned, but the discovery
had been announced that he was not indispensable;
indeed, there were those who said that it
was better thus. The Easter Rebellion was well
in hand; order was understood to reign in an
<span class="newpage"><a name="page288" id="page288">[288]</a></span>
Ireland hidden behind the black veil of the
censorship. The mighty naval battle of Jutland
had quickly transformed itself from a defeat into
a brilliant triumph. The disturbing prices of
food were about to be reduced by means of a
committee. In America the Republican forces
were preparing to eject President Wilson in
favour of another Hughes who could be counted
upon to realise the world-destiny of the United
States. An economic conference was assembling
in Paris with the object of cutting Germany off
from the rest of the human race after the war.
And in eleven days the Russians had made
prisoners of a hundred and fifty thousand
Austrians, and Brusiloff had just said: &quot;This is
only the beginning.&quot; Lastly the close prospect of
the resistless Allied Western offensive which would
deracinate Prussian militarism was uplifting men's
minds.</p>

<p>Christine walked nonchalantly and uninvitingly
through the streets, quite unresponsive to the
exhilaration of events.</p>

<p>&quot;Marthe!&quot; she called, when she had let herself
into the flat. Contrary to orders, the little hall
was in darkness. There was no answer. She lit
the hall and passed into the kitchen, lighting it
also. There, in the terrible and incurable squalor
of Marthe's own kitchen, Marthe's apron was
thrown untidily across the back of the solitary
windsor chair. She knew then that Marthe had
gone out, and in truth, although very annoyed,
she was not altogether surprised.</p>

<p>Marthe had a mysterious love affair. It was
astonishing, in view of the intensely aphrodisiacal
<span class="newpage"><a name="page289" id="page289">[289]</a></span>
atmosphere in which she lived, that Marthe did not
continually have love affairs. But the day of love
had seemed for Marthe to be over, and Christine
found great difficulty in getting her ever to leave
the flat, save on necessary household errands. On
the other hand it was astonishing that any man
should be attracted by the fat slattern. The moth
now fluttering round her was an Italian waiter, as
to whom Christine had learnt that he was being
unjustly hunted by the Italian military authorities.
Hence the mystery necessarily attaching to the
love affair. Being French, Christine despised him.
He called Marthe by her right name of &quot;Marta,&quot;
and Christine had more than once heard the pair
gabbling in the kitchen in Italian. Just as though
she had been a conventional <i>bourgeoise</i> Christine
now accused Marthe of ingratitude because the
woman was subordinating Christine's convenience
to the supreme exigencies of fate. A man's freedom
might be in the balance, Marthe's future might
be in the balance; but supposing that Christine
had come home with a gallant&mdash;and no <i>femme
de chambre</i> to do service!</p>

<p>She walked about the flat, shut the windows,
drew the blinds, removed her hat, removed her
gloves, stretched them, put her things away; she
gazed at the two principal rooms, at the soiled
numbers of <i>La Vie Parisienne</i> and the cracked
bric-&agrave;-brac in the drawing-room, at the rent in
the lace bedcover, and the foul mess of toilet
apparatus in the bedroom. The forlorn emptiness
of the place appalled her. She had been quite fairly
successful in her London career. Hundreds of
men had caressed her and paid her with compliments
<span class="newpage"><a name="page290" id="page290">[290]</a></span>
and sweets and money. She had been
really admired. The flat had had gay hours.
Unmistakable aristocrats had yielded to her.
And she had escaped the five scourges of her
profession....</p>

<p>It was all over. The chapter was closed. She
saw nothing in front of her but decline and ruin.
She had escaped the five scourges of her profession,
but part of the price of this immunity was that
through keeping herself to herself she had not a
friend. Despite her profession, and because of
the prudence with which she exercised it, she was
a solitary, a recluse.</p>

<p>Yes, of course she had Gilbert. She could
count upon Gilbert to a certain extent, to a
considerable extent; but he would not be eternal,
and his fancy for her would not be eternal. Once,
before Easter, she had had the idea that he meant
to suggest to her an exclusive liaison. Foolish!
Nothing, less than nothing, had come of it. He
would not be such an imbecile as to suggest such
a thing to her. Miracles did not happen, at any
rate not that kind of miracle.</p>

<p>In the midst of her desolation an old persistent
dream revisited her: the dream of a small country
cottage in France, with a dog, a faithful servant,
respectability, good name, works of charity, her
own praying-stool in the village church. She
moved to the wardrobe and unlocked one of the
drawers beneath the wide doors. And rummaging
under the linen and under the photographs under
the linen she drew forth a package and spread its
contents on the table in the drawing-room. Her
securities, her bonds of the City of Paris, ever
<span class="newpage"><a name="page291" id="page291">[291]</a></span>
increasing! Gilbert had tried to induce her to
accept more attractive investments. But she would
not. Never! These were her consols, part of her
religion. Bonds of the City of Paris had fallen in
value, but not in her dogmatic esteem. The
passionate little miser that was in her surveyed
them with pleasure, even with assurance; but they
were still far too few to stand for the realisation
of her dream. And she might have to sell some of
them soon in order to live. She replaced them
carefully in the drawer with dejection unabated.</p>

<p>When she glanced at the table again she saw
an envelope. Inexplicably she had not noticed it
before. She seized it in hope&mdash;and recognised in
the address the curious hand of her landlord. It
contained a week's notice to quit. The tenancy of
the flat was weekly. This was the last blow. All
the invisible powers of London were conspiring
together to shatter the profession. What in the
name of the Holy Virgin had come over the
astounding, incomprehensible city? Then there
was a ring at the bell. Marthe? No, Marthe
would never ring; she had a key and she would
creep in. A lover? A rich, spendthrift, kind lover?
Hope flickered anew in her desolated heart.</p>

<p>It was the other pretty lady&mdash;a newcomer&mdash;who
lived in the house: a rather stylish woman of about
thirty-five, unusually fair, with regular features
and a very dignified carriage, indeed not unimposing.
They had met once, at the foot of the stairs.
Christine was not sure of her name. She proclaimed
herself to be Russian, but Christine
doubted the assertion. Her French had no trace
of a foreign accent; and in view of the achieve-merits
<span class="newpage"><a name="page292" id="page292">[292]</a></span>
of the Russian Army ladies were finding it
advantageous to be of Russian blood. Still she
had a fine cosmopolitan air to which Christine
could not pretend. They engaged each other in
glances.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope I do not disturb you, madame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all, madame. I am obliged to open
the door myself because my servant is out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought I heard you come in, and so&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; interrupted Christine, determined not
to admit the defeat of having returned from the
Promenade alone. &quot;I have not been out. Probably
it was my servant you heard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!... Without doubt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you give yourself the trouble to enter,
madame?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; exclaimed the Russian, in the sitting-room.
&quot;You will excuse me, madame, but what
a beautiful photograph!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are too amiable, madame. A friend had
it done for me.&quot;</p>

<p>They sat down.</p>

<p>&quot;You are deliciously installed here,&quot; said the
Russian perfunctorily, looking round. &quot;Now,
madame, I have been here only three weeks. And
to-night I receive a notice to quit. Shall I be
indiscreet if I ask if you have received a similar
notice?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This very evening,&quot; said Christine, in secret
still more disconcerted by this further proof of a
general plot against human nature. She was
about to add: &quot;I found it here on my return
home,&quot; but, remembering her fib, managed to
stop in time.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page293" id="page293">[293]</a></span>
<p>&quot;Well, madame, I know little of London. Without
doubt you know London to the bottom. Is it
serious, this notice?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite serious?&quot;</p>

<p>Christine said:</p>

<p>&quot;You see, there is a crisis. It is the war that
in London has led to the discovery that men have
desires. Of course, it will pass, but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, of course.... But it is grotesque, this
crisis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is perfectly grotesque,&quot; Christine agreed.</p>

<p>&quot;You do not by hazard know where one can
find flats to let? I hear speak of Bloomsbury and
of Long Acre. But it seems to me that those
quarters&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am in London since now more than eighteen
months,&quot; said Christine. &quot;And as for all those
things I know little. I have lived here in this
flat all the time, and I go out so rarely&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The Russian put in with eagerness:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I also! I go out, so to speak, not at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought I had seen you once in the Promenade
at the&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it is true,&quot; interrupted the Russian
quickly. &quot;I went from curiosity, for distraction.
You see, since the war I have lived in Dublin. I
had there a friend, very highly placed in the
administration. He married. One lived terrible
hours during the revolt. I decided to come to
London, especially as&mdash;However, I do not
wish to fatigue you with all that.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine said nothing. The Irish Rebellion
did not interest her. She was in no mood for
<span class="newpage"><a name="page294" id="page294">[294]</a></span>
talking about the Irish Rebellion. She had convinced
herself that all Sinn Feiners were in
German pay, and naught else mattered. Never,
she thought, had the British Government carried
ingenuousness further than in this affair! Given
a free hand, Christine with her strong, direct
common sense would have settled the Irish question
in forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>The Russian, after a little pause, continued:</p>

<p>&quot;I merely wished to ask you whether the notice
to quit was serious&mdash;not a trick for raising the
rent.&quot;</p>

<p>Christine shook her head to the last clause.</p>

<p>&quot;And then, if the notice was quite serious,
whether you knew of any flats&mdash;not too dear....
Not that I mind a good rent if one receives the
value of it, and is left tranquil.&quot;</p>

<p>The conversation might at this point have
taken a more useful turn if Christine had not felt
bound to hold herself up against the other's high
tone of indifference to expenditure. The Russian,
in demanding &quot;tranquillity,&quot; had admitted that
she regularly practised the profession&mdash;or, as
English girls strangely called it, &quot;the business&quot;&mdash;and
Christine could have followed her lead into
the region of gossiping and intimate realism where
detailed confidences are enlighteningly exchanged;
but the tone about money was a challenge.</p>

<p>&quot;I should have been enchanted to be of service
to you,&quot; said Christine. &quot;But I know nothing. I
go out less and less. As for this notice, I smile
at it. I have a friend upon whom I can count for
everything. I have only to tell him, and he will
put me among my own furniture at once. He has
<span class="newpage"><a name="page295" id="page295">[295]</a></span>
indeed already suggested it. So that, <i>je m'en fiche</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I also!&quot; said the Russian. &quot;My new friend&mdash;he
is a colonel, sent from Dublin to London&mdash;has
insisted upon putting me among my own
furniture. But I have refused so far&mdash;because one
likes to know more of a gentleman&mdash;does not
one?&mdash;before ...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Truly!&quot; murmured Christine.</p>

<p>&quot;And there is always Paris,&quot; said the Russian.</p>

<p>&quot;But I thought you were from Petrograd.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. But I know Paris well. Ah! There is
only Paris! Paris is a second home to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can one get a passport easily for Paris?...
I mean, supposing the air-raids grew too dangerous
again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not, madame? If one has one's papers.
To get a passport from Paris to London, that
would be another thing, I admit.... I see that
you play,&quot; the Russian added, rising, with a
gesture towards the piano. &quot;I have heard you
play. You play with true taste. I know, for when
a girl I played much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You flatter me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. I think your friend plays too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Christine. &quot;He!... It is an artist,
that one.&quot;</p>

<p>They turned over the music, exchanged views
about waltzes, became enthusiastic, laughed, and
parted amid manifestations of good breeding and
goodwill. As soon as Christine was alone, she sat
down and wept. She could not longer contain her
distress. Paris gleamed before her. But no! It
was a false gleam. She could not make a new
start in Paris during the war. The adventure
<span class="newpage"><a name="page296" id="page296">[296]</a></span>
would be too perilous; the adventure might end in
a licensed house. And yet in London&mdash;what was
there in London but, ultimately, the pavement?
And the pavement meant complications with the
police, with prowlers, with other women; it meant
all the scourges of the profession, including
probably alcoholism. It meant prostitution, to
which she had never sunk!</p>

<p>She wished she had been killed outright in the
air-raid. She had an idea of going to the Oratory
the next morning, and perhaps choosing a new
Virgin and soliciting favour of the image thereof.
She sobbed, and, sobbing, suddenly jumped up
and ran to the telephone. And even as she
gave Gilbert's number, she broke it in the middle
with a sob. After all, there was Gilbert.</p>

<h4>THE VICTORY</h4>
<br />

<p>&quot;Get back into bed,&quot; said G.J., having silently
opened the window in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>He spoke with courteous persuasion, but his
peculiar intense politeness and restraint somewhat
dismayed Christine. By experience she knew that
they were a sure symptom of annoyance. She
often, though not on this occasion, wished that he
would yield to anger and make a scene; but he
never did, and she would hate him for not doing
so. The fact was that under the agreement which
ruled their relations, she had no right to telephone
to him, save in grave and instant emergency, and
even then it was her duty to say first, when she
got the communication: &quot;Mr. Pringle wants to
speak to Mr. Hoape.&quot; She had omitted, in her
disquiet, to fulfil this formality. Recognising his
voice, she had begun passionately, without
preliminary: &quot;Oh! Beloved, thou canst not
imagine what has happened to me&mdash;&quot; etc. Still
he had come. He had cut her short, but he had
left whatever he was doing and had, amazingly,
walked over at once. And in the meantime she
had hurriedly undressed and put on a new peignoir
and slipped into bed. Of course she had had to
open the door herself.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page298" id="page298">[298]</a></span>
<p>She obeyed his command like an intelligent
little mouse, and he sat down on the edge of the
bed. He might inspire foreboding, alarm, even
terror. But he was in the flat. He was the saviour,
man, in the flat. And his coming was in the
nature of a miracle. He might have been out; he
might have been entertaining; he might have been
engaged; he might well have said that he could
not come until the next day. Never before had
she made such a request, and he had acceded to it
immediately! Her mood was one of frightened
triumph. He was being most damnably himself;
his demeanour was as faultless as his dress. She
could not even complain that he had forgotten to
kiss her. He said nothing about her transgression
of the rule as to telephoning. He was waiting,
with his exasperating sense of justice and self-control,
until she had acquainted him with her
case. Instead of referring coldly and disapprovingly
to the matter of the telephone, he said in a
judicious, amicable voice:</p>

<p>&quot;I doubt whether your coiffeur is all that he
ought to be. I see you had your hair waved
to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You should tell the fellow to give you the
new method of hair-waving, steaming with electric
heaters&mdash;or else go where you can get it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;New method?&quot; repeated Christine the Tory
doubtfully. And then with sudden sexual
suspicion:</p>

<p>&quot;Who told you about it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! I heard of it months ago,&quot; he said carelessly.
&quot;Besides, it's in the papers, in the advertisements.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page299" id="page299">[299]</a></span>
It lasts longer&mdash;much longer&mdash;and it's
more artistic.&quot;</p>

<p>She felt sure that he had been discussing hair-waving
with some woman. She thought of all
her grievances against him. The Lechford House
episode rankled in her mind. He had given her
the details, but she said to herself that he had given
her the details only because he had foreseen that
she would hear about the case from others or read
about it in the newspapers. She had not been
able to stomach that he should be at Lechford
House alone late at night with two women of the
class she hated and feared&mdash;and the very night of
her dreadful experience with him in the bomb-explosion!
No explanations could make that seem
proper or fair. Naturally she had never disclosed
her feelings. Further, the frequenting of such a
house as Lechford House was more proof of his
social importance, and incidentally of his riches.
The spectacle of his flat showed her long ago that
previously she had been underestimating his
situation in the world. The revelations as to
Lechford House had seemed to show her that she
was still underestimating it. She resented his
modesty. She was inclined to attribute his
modesty to a desire to pay her as little as he
reasonably could. However, she could not in
sincerity do so. He treated her handsomely,
considering her pretensions, but considering his
position&mdash;he had no pretensions&mdash;not handsomely.
She had had an irrational idea that, having
permitted her to see the splendour of his flat, he
ought to have increased her emoluments&mdash;that,
indeed, she should be paid not according to her
<span class="newpage"><a name="page300" id="page300">[300]</a></span>
original environment, but according to his. She
also resented that he had never again asked her to
his flat. Her behaviour on that sole visit had
apparently decided him not to invite her any
more. She resented his perfectly hidden resentment.</p>

<p>What disturbed her more than anything else
was a notion in her mind, possibly a wrong notion,
that she cared for him less madly than of old. She
had always said to herself, and more than once
sadly to him, that his fancy for her would not and
could not last; but that hers for him should decline
puzzled her and added to her grievances against
him. She looked at him from the little nest
made by her head between two pillows. Did she
in truth care for him less madly than of old?
She wondered. She had only one gauge, the
physical.</p>

<p>She began to talk despairingly about Marthe,
whom, of course, she had had to mention at the
door. He said quietly:</p>

<p>&quot;But it's not because of Marthe's caprices that
I'm asked to come down to-night, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p>She told him about the closing of the Promenade
in a tone of absolute, resigned certainty
that admitted of no facile pooh-poohings or
reassurances. And then, glancing sidelong at the
night-table, where the lamp burned, she extended
her half-bared arm and picked up the landlord's
notice and gave it to him to read. Watching him
read it she inwardly trembled, as though she had
started on some perilous enterprise the end of
which might be black desperation, as though she
had cast off from the shore and was afloat amid
<span class="newpage"><a name="page301" id="page301">[301]</a></span>
the waves of a vast, swollen river&mdash;waves that
often hid the distant further bank. She felt somehow
that she was playing for all or nothing. And
though she had had immense experience of men,
though it was her special business to handle men,
she felt herself to be unskilled and incompetent.
The common ruses, feints, devices, guiles, chicaneries
were familiar to her; she could employ them
as well as any and better than most; they succeeded
marvellously and absurdly&mdash;in the common
embarrassments and emergencies, because they
had not to stand the test of time. Their purpose
was temporary, and when the purpose had been
accomplished it did not matter whether they were
unmasked or not, for the adversary-victim&mdash;who,
in any event, was better treated than he deserved!&mdash;either
had gone for ever, or would soon forget,
or was too proud to murmur, or philosophically
accepted a certain amount of wile as part of the
price of ecstasy. But this embarrassment and this
emergency were not common. They were a
supreme crisis.</p>

<p>&quot;The other lady has had notice too,&quot; she said,
and went on: &quot;It's the same everywhere in this
quarter. I know not if it is the same in other
districts, but quite probably it is.... It is the
end.&quot;</p>

<p>She saw by the lifting of his eyebrows that he
was impressed, that he secretly admitted the
justifiability of her summons to him. And instantly
she took a reasonable, wise, calm tone.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a little serious, is it not? I do not frighten
myself, but it is serious. Above all, I do not wish
to trouble thee. I know all thy anxieties, and I am
<span class="newpage"><a name="page302" id="page302">[302]</a></span>
a woman who understands. But except thee I
have not a friend, as I have often told thee.
In my heart there is a place only for one. I have
a horror of all those women. They weary me. I
am not like them, as thou well knowest. Thus my
existence is solitary. I have no relations. Not one.
See! Go into no matter what interior, and there
are photographs. But here&mdash;not one. Yes, one.
My own. I am forced to regard my own portrait.
What would I not give to be able to put on my
chimney-piece thy portrait! But I cannot. Do
not deceive thyself. I am not complaining. I
comprehend perfectly. It is impossible that a
woman like me should have thy photograph on
her chimney-piece.&quot; She smiled, smoothing for a
moment the pucker out of her brow. &quot;And lately
I see thee so little. Thou comest less frequently.
And when thou comest, well&mdash;one embraces&mdash;a
little music&mdash;and then <i>pouf</i>! Thou art gone. Is it
not so?&quot;</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>&quot;But thou knowest the reason, I am terribly
busy. I have all the preoccupations in the world.
My committee&mdash;it is not all smooth, my committee.
Everything and everybody depends on
me. And in the committee I have enemies too.
The fact is, I have become a beast of burden. I
dream about it. And there are others in worse
case. We shall soon be in the third year of the
war. We must not forget that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My little rabbit,&quot; she replied very calmly
and reasonably and caressingly. &quot;Do not imagine
to thyself that I blame thee. I do not blame thee.
I comprehend too well all that thou dost, all that
<span class="newpage"><a name="page303" id="page303">[303]</a></span>
thou art worth. In every way thou art stronger
than me. I am ten times nothing. I know it.
I have no grievance against thee. Thou hast
always given me what thou couldst, and I on my
part have never demanded too much. Say, have
I been excessive? At this hour I make no claim
on thee. I have done all that to me was possible
to make thee happy. In my soul I have always
been faithful to thee. I do not praise myself for
that. I did not choose it. These things are not
chosen. They come to pass&mdash;that is all. And it
arrived that I was bound to go mad about thee,
and to remain so. What wouldst thou? Speak
not of the war. Is it not because of the war that
I am in exile, and that I am ruined? I have
always worked honestly for my living. And there
is not on earth an officer who has encountered me
who can say that I have not been particularly nice
to him&mdash;because he was an officer. Thou wilt
excuse me if I speak of such matters. I know I am
wrong. It is contrary to my habit. But what
wouldst thou? I also have done what I could for
the war. But it is my ruin. Oh, my Gilbert! Tell
me what I must do. I ask nothing from thee but advice.
It was for that that I dared to telephone thee.&quot;</p>

<p>G.J. answered casually:</p>

<p>&quot;I see nothing to worry about. It will be
necessary to take another flat. That is all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I&mdash;I know nothing of London. One tells
me that it is in future impossible for women who
live alone&mdash;like me&mdash;to find a flat&mdash;that is to
say, respectable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Absurd! I will find a flat. I know precisely
where there is a flat.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page304" id="page304">[304]</a></span>
<p>&quot;But will they let it to me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They will let it to <i>me</i>, I suppose,&quot; said he,
still casually.</p>

<p>A pause ensued.</p>

<p>She said, in a voice trembling:</p>

<p>&quot;Thou art not going to say to me that thou
wilt put me among my own furniture?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The flat is furnished. But it is the same thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do not let such a hope shine before me&mdash;me
who saw before me only the pavement. Thou
art not serious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never was more serious. For whom dost
thou take me, little-foolish one?&quot;</p>

<p>She cried:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you English! You are <i>chic</i>. You make love
as you go to war. Like <i>that</i>!... One word&mdash;it is
decided! And there is nothing more to say! Ah!
You English!&quot;</p>

<p>She had almost screamed, shuddering under
the shock of his decision, for which she had
impossibly hoped, but whose reality overwhelmed
her. He sat there in front of her, elegant, impeccably
dressed, distinguished, aristocratic, rich,
in the full wisdom of his years, and in the strength
of his dominating will, and in the righteousness of
his heart. One could absolutely trust such as him
to do the right thing, and to do it generously, and
to do it all the time. And she, <i>she</i> had won him.
He had recognised her qualities. She had denied
any claim upon him, but by his decision he had
admitted a claim&mdash;a claim that no money could
satisfy. After all, for eighteen months she had
been more to him than any other woman. He
had talked freely to her. He had concealed
<span class="newpage"><a name="page305" id="page305">[305]</a></span>
naught from her. He had spoken to her of his
discouragements and his weaknesses. He had had
no shame before her. By her acquiescences, her
skill, her warmth, her adaptability, her intense
womanliness, she had created between them a
bond stronger than anything that could keep them
apart. The bond existed. It could not during the
whole future be broken save by a disloyalty. A
disloyalty, she divined, would irrevocably destroy
it. But she had no fear on that score, for she knew
her own nature. His decision did more than fill
her with a dizzy sense of relief, a mad, intolerable
happiness&mdash;it re-established her self-respect. No
ordinary woman, handicapped as she was, could
have captured this fastidious and shy paragon ...
And the notion that her passion for him had
dwindled was utterly ridiculous, like the notion
that he would tire of her. She was saved. She
burst into wild tears.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! Pardon me!&quot; she sobbed. &quot;I am quite
calm, really. But since the air-raid, thou knowest,
I have not been quite the same ... Thou! Thou
art different. Nothing could disturb thy calm.
Ah! If thou wert a general at the front! What
sang-froid! What presence of mind! But I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He bent towards her, and she suddenly sprang
up and seized him round the neck, and ate his
lips, and while she strangled and consumed him
she kept muttering to him:</p>

<p>&quot;Hope not that I shall thank thee. I cannot.
I cannot! The words with which I could thank
thee do not exist. But I am thine, thine! All of
me is thine. Humiliate me! Demand of me
impossible things! I am thy slave, thy creature!
<span class="newpage"><a name="page306" id="page306">[306]</a></span>
Ah! Let me kiss thy beautiful grey hairs. I love
thy hair. And thy ears ...&quot;</p>

<p>The thought of her insatiable temperament
flashed through her as she held him, and of his
northern sobriety, and of the profound, unchangeable
difference between these two. She would
discipline her temperament; she would subjugate
it. Women were capable of miracles&mdash;and women
alone. And she was capable of miracles.</p>

<p>A strange, muffled noise came to them across
the darkness of the sitting-room, and G.J. raised
his head slightly to listen.</p>

<p>&quot;Repose! Repose thyself in the arms of thy
little mother,&quot; she breathed softly. &quot;It is nothing.
It is but the wind blowing the blind against the
curtains.&quot;</p>

<p>And later, when she had distilled the magic of
the hour and was tranquillised, she said:</p>

<p>&quot;And where is it, this flat?&quot;</p>

Gaston, the new servant in the new flat, who was
holding in her hand a telegram addressed to
&quot;Hoape, Albany&quot;:</p>

<p>&quot;Give it to me. I will put it in front of the clock
on the mantelpiece.&quot;</p>

<p>And she lodged it among the gilt cupids that
supported the clock on the fringed mantelpiece
in the drawing-room. She did so with a little
gesture of childlike glee expressing her satisfaction
in the flat as a whole.</p>

<p>The flat was dark; she did not object, loving
artificial light. The rooms were all very small;
she loved cosiness. There was a garage close by,
which might have disturbed her nights; but it did
not. The bathroom was open to the bedroom;
no arrangement could be better. G.J. in
enumerating the disadvantages of the flat had said
also that it was too much and too heavily furnished.
Not at all. She adored the cumbrous and rich
furniture; she did not want in her flat the empty
spaces of a ball-room; she wanted to feel that she
was within an interior&mdash;inside something. She
gloried in the flat. She preferred it even to her
memory of G.J.'s flat in the Albany. Its golden
<span class="newpage"><a name="page308" id="page308">[308]</a></span>
ornateness flattered her. The glittering cornices,
and the big carved frames of the pictures of
impossible flowers and of ladies and gentlemen
in historic coiffures and costumes, appeared
marvellous to her. She had never seen, and
certainly had never hoped to inhabit, anything
like it. But then Gilbert was always better than
his word.</p>

<p>He had been quite frank, telling her that he
knew of the existence of the flat simply because
it had been occupied for a brief time by the Mrs.
Carlos Smith of whom she had heard and read,
and who had had to leave it on account of health.
(She did not remind him that once at the beginning
of the war when she had noticed the name
and portrait of Mrs. Carlos Smith in the paper,
he, sitting by her side, had concealed from her
that he knew Mrs. Carlos Smith. Judiciously, she
had never made the slightest reference to that
episode.) Though she detested the unknown Mrs.
Carlos Smith, she admired and envied her for a
great illustrious personage, and was secretly very
proud of succeeding Mrs. Carlos Smith in the
tenancy. And when Gilbert told her that he had
had his eye on the flat for her before Mrs. Carlos
Smith took it, and had hesitated on account of its
drawbacks, she was even more proud. And
reassured also. For this detail was a proof that
Gilbert had really had the intention to put her
&quot;among her own furniture&quot; long before the night
of the supreme appeal to him.... Only he was
always so cautious.</p>

<p>And Gilbert was the discoverer of la m&egrave;re
Gaston, too, and as frank about her as about the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page309" id="page309">[309]</a></span>
flat. La m&egrave;re Gaston was the widow of a French
soldier, domiciled in London previous to the war,
who had died of wounds in one of the Lechford
hospitals; and it was through the Lechford Committee
that Gilbert had come across her. A few
weeks earlier than the beginning of the formal
liaison Mrs. Braiding had fallen ill for a space, and
Madame Gaston had been summoned as charwoman
to aid Mrs. Braiding's young sister in the
Albany flat. With excellent judgment Gilbert
had chosen her to succeed Marthe, whom he himself
had reproachfully dismissed from Cork Street.</p>

<p>He was amazingly clever, was Gilbert, for he
had so arranged things that Christine had been
able to cut off her Cork Street career as with a
knife. She had departed from Cork Street with
two trunks and a few cardboard boxes&mdash;her stove
was abandoned to the landlord&mdash;and vanished
into London and left no trace. Except Gilbert,
nobody who knew her in Cork Street was aware of
her new address, and nobody who knew her in
Mayfair knew that she had come from Cork Street.
Her ancient acquaintances in Cork Street would
ring the bell there in vain.</p>

<p>Madame Gaston was a neat, plump woman of
perhaps forty, not looking her years. She had a
comprehending eye. After three words from
Gilbert she had mastered the situation, and as she
perfectly realised where her interest lay she could
be relied upon for discretion. In all delicate
matters only her eye talked. She was a Protestant,
and went to the French church in Soho Square,
which she called the &quot;Temple&quot;. Christine and
she had had but one Sunday together&mdash;and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page310" id="page310">[310]</a></span>
Christine had gone with her to the Temple! The
fact was that Christine had decided to be a
Protestant. She needed a religion, and Catholicism
had an inconvenience&mdash;confession. She had
regularised her position, so much so that by
comparison with the past she was now perfectly
respectable. Yet if she had been candid in the
confessional the priest would still have convicted
her of mortal sin; which would have been very
unfair; and she could not, in view of her respectability,
have remained a Catholic without confessing,
however infrequently. Madame Gaston, as soon as
she was sure of her convert, referred to Catholicism as
&quot;idolatry&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Put your apron on, Marie,&quot; said Christine.
&quot;Monsieur will be here directly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes, madame!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you opened the kitchen-window to take
away the smell of cooking?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, madame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I all right, Marie?&quot;</p>

<p>Madame Gaston surveyed her mistress, who
turned round.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, madame. I think that monsieur will
much like that <i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;e</i>.&quot; She departed to don
the apron.</p>

<p>Between these two it was continually &quot;monsieur,&quot;
&quot;monsieur&quot;. He was seldom there, but
he was always there, always being consulted,
placated, invoked, revered, propitiated, magnified.
He was the giver of all good, and there was no
other Allah, and he had two prophets.</p>

<p>Christine sang, she twittered, she pirouetted,
out of sheer youthful joy. She had forgotten
<span class="newpage"><a name="page311" id="page311">[311]</a></span>
care and forgotten promiscuity; good fortune had
washed her pure. She looked at herself in the
massive bevelled mirror, and saw that she was
fresh and young and lithe and graceful. And she
felt triumphant. Gilbert had expressed the fear
that she might get lonely and bored. He had
even said that occasionally he might bring along
a man, and that perhaps the man would have a
very nice woman friend. She had not very
heartily responded. She was markedly sympathetic
towards Englishmen, but towards English
women&mdash;no! And especially she did not want to
know any English women in the same situation as
herself. Lonely? Impossible! Bored? Impossible!
She had an establishment. She had a civil list.
Her days passed like an Arabian dream. She
never had an unfilled moment, and when each
day was over she always remembered little things
which she had meant to do and had not found
time to do.</p>

<p>She was a superb sleeper, and arose at noon.
Three o'clock usually struck before her day had
fairly begun&mdash;unless, of course, she happened to
be very busy, in which case she would be ready
for contact with the world at the lunch-hour. Her
main occupation was to charm, allure, and gratify
a man; for that she lived. Her distractions were
music, the reading of novels, <i>Le Journal</i>, and <i>Les
Grandes Modes</i>. And for the war she knitted. In
her new situation it was essential that she should
do something for the war. Therefore she knitted,
being a good knitter, and her knitting generally
lay about.</p>

<p>She popped into the dining-room to see if the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page312" id="page312">[312]</a></span>
table was well set for dinner. It was, but in order
to show that Marie did not know everything, she
rearranged somewhat the flowers in the central
bowl. Then she returned to the drawing-room,
and sat down at the piano and waited. The
instant of arrival approached. Gilbert's punctuality
was absolute, always had been; sometimes
it alarmed her. She could not have to wait more
than a minute or two, according to the inexactitude
of her clock.... The bell rang, and simultaneously
she began to play a five-finger exercise.
Often in the old life she had executed upon him
this innocent subterfuge, to make him think she
practised the piano to a greater extent than she
actually did, that indeed she was always practising.
It never occurred to her that he was not
deceived.</p>

<p>Hear Marie fly to the front door! See Christine's
face, see her body, as in her pale, bright gown
she peeps round the half-open door of the drawing-room!
She lives, then. Her eyes sparkle for the
giver of all good, for the adored, and her brow is
puckered for him, and the jewels on her hand
burn for him, and every pleat of her garments
visible and invisible is pleated for him. She is a
child. She has snatched up a chocolate, and put
it between her teeth, and so she offers the half of
it to him, smiling, silent. She is a child, but she is
also a woman intensely skilled in her art....</p>

<p>&quot;Monster!&quot; she said. &quot;Come this way.&quot; And
she led him down the tunnel to the bedroom.
There, in a corner of the bathroom, stood an
antique closed toilet-stand, such as was used by
men in the days before splashing and sousing were
<span class="newpage"><a name="page313" id="page313">[313]</a></span>
invented. She had removed it from the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&quot;Open it,&quot; she commanded.</p>

<p>He obeyed. Its little compartments, which
had been empty, were filled with a man's toilet
instruments&mdash;brushes, file, scissors, shaving-soap
(his own brand), a safety-razor, &amp;c. The set was
complete. She had known exactly the requirements.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a little present from thy woman,&quot; she
said. &quot;In future thou wilt have no excuse&mdash;Sit
down. Marie!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Madame?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take off the boots of Monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>Marie knelt.</p>

<p>Christine found the new slippers.</p>

<p>&quot;And now this!&quot; she said, after he had washed
and used the new brushes, producing a black
house-jacket with velvet collar and cuffs.</p>

<p>&quot;How tired thou must be after thy day!&quot; she
murmured, patting him with tiny pats.</p>

<p>&quot;Thou knowest, my little one,&quot; she said,
pointing to the gas-stove in the bedroom fireplace.
&quot;For the other rooms a gas-stove&mdash;I am indifferent.
But the bedroom is something else. The
bedroom is sacred. I could not tolerate a gas-stove
in the bedroom. A coal fire is necessary to
me. You do not think so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;You are quite right. It shall
be seen to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can I give the order? Thou permittest me
to give the order?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

<p>In the drawing-room she cushioned him well
<span class="newpage"><a name="page314" id="page314">[314]</a></span>
in the best easy-chair, and, sitting down on a
pouf near him, began to knit like an industrious
wife who understands the seriousness of war.
Nothing escaped the attention of that man. He
espied the telegram.</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; she cried, springing up and giving it to
him. &quot;Stupid that I am! I forgot.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked at the address.</p>

<p>&quot;How did this come here?&quot; he asked mildly.</p>

<p>&quot;Marie brought it&mdash;from the Albany.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p>He opened the telegram and read it, having
dropped the envelope into the silk-lined, gilded
waste-paper basket by the fender.</p>

<p>&quot;It is nothing serious?&quot; she questioned.</p>

<p>&quot;No. Business.&quot;</p>

<p>He might have shown it to her&mdash;he had shown
her telegrams before&mdash;but he stuck it into his
pocket. Then, without a word to Christine, he
rang the bell, and Marie appeared.</p>

<p>&quot;Marie! The telegram&mdash;why did you bring
it here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Monsieur, it was like this. I went to monsieur's
flat to fetch two aprons that I had left there. The
telegram was on the console in the ante-chamber.
Knowing that monsieur was to come direct here,
I brought it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does Mrs. Braiding know you brought it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! As for Mrs. Braiding, monsieur&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Marie stopped, disclaiming any responsibility for
Mrs. Braiding, of whom she was somewhat jealous.
&quot;I thought to do well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am sure of it. But surely you can see you
<span class="newpage"><a name="page315" id="page315">[315]</a></span>
have been indiscreet. Don't do it again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, monsieur. I ask pardon of monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards he said to Christine in
a gay, careless tone:</p>

<p>&quot;And this gas-stove here? Is it all right? Have
we tried it? Let us try it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The weather is warm, dearest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But just to try it. I always like to satisfy
myself&mdash;in time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fusser!&quot; she exclaimed, and ignited the stove.</p>

<p>He gazed at it absently, then picked up a
cigarette and, taking the telegram from his pocket,
folded it into a spill and with it lit the cigarette.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said meditatively. &quot;It seems not a
bad stove.&quot; And he held the spill till it had burnt
to his finger-ends. Then he extinguished the stove.</p>

<p>She said to herself:</p>

<p>&quot;He has burned the telegram on purpose. But
how cleverly he did it! Ah! That man! There is
none but him!&quot;</p>

<p>She was disquieted about the telegram. She
feared it. Her superstitiousness was awakened.
She thought of her apostasy from Catholicism to
Protestantism. She thought of a Holy Virgin
angered. And throughout the evening and
throughout the night, amid her smiles and teasings
and coaxings and caresses and ecstasies and all her
accomplished, voluptuous girlishness, the image
of a resentful Holy Virgin flitted before her. Why
should he burn a business telegram? Also, was
he not at intervals a little absent-minded?</p>

<h4>THE WINDOW</h4>
<br />

<p>G.J. sat on the oilcloth-covered seat of the
large overhanging open bay-window. Below him
was the river, tributary of the Severn; in front the
Old Bridge, with an ancient street rising beyond,
and above that the silhouette of the roofs of
Wrikton surmounted by the spire of its vast church.
To the left was the weir, and the cliffs were there
also, and the last tints of the sunset.</p>

<p>Somebody came into the coffee-room. G.J.
looked round, hoping that it might, after all, be
Concepcion. But it was Concepcion's maid,
Emily, an imitative young woman who seemed to
have caught from her former employer the quality
of strange, sinister provocativeness.</p>

<p>She paused a moment before speaking. Her
thin figure was somewhat indistinct in the
twilight.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Smith wishes me to say that she will
certainly be well enough to take you to the station
in the morning, sir,&quot; said she in her specious tones.
&quot;But she hopes you will be able to stay till the
afternoon train.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shan't.&quot; He shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>And after another moment's pause Emily,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page317" id="page317">[317]</a></span>
apparently with a challenging reluctance, receded
through the shadows of the room and vanished.</p>

<p>G.J. was extremely depressed and somewhat
indignant. He gazed down bitterly at the water,
following with his eye the incredibly long branches
of the tree that from the height of the buttresses
drooped perpendicularly into the water. He had
had an astounding week-end; and for having
responded to Concepcion's telegram, for having
taken the telegram seriously, he had deserved
what he got. Thus he argued.</p>

<p>She had met him on the hot Saturday afternoon
in a Ford car. She did not look ill. She looked
as if she had fairly recovered from her acute
neurasthenia. She was smartly and carelessly
dressed in a summer sporting costume, and had
made a strong contrast to every other human
being on the platform of the small provincial
station. The car drove not to the famous principal
hotel, but to a small hotel just beyond the bridge.
She had given him tea in the coffee-room and
taken him out again, on foot, showing him the
town&mdash;the half-timbered houses, the immense
castle, the market-hall, the spacious flat-fronted
residences, the multiplicity of solicitors, banks and
surveyors, the bursting provision shops with
imposing fractions of animals and expensive pies,
and the drapers with ladies' blouses at 2s. 4d.
Then she had conducted him to an organ recital
in the vast church where, amid faint gas-jets and
beadles and stalls and stained glass and holiness
and centuries of history and the high respectability
of the town, she had whispered sibilantly, and other
people had whispered, in the long intervals of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page318" id="page318">[318]</a></span>
organ. She had removed him from the church
before the collection for the Red Cross, and when
they had eaten a sort of dinner she had borne him
away to the Russian dancers in the Moot Hall.</p>

<p>She said she had seen the Russian dancers once
already, and that they were richly worth to him a
six-hours' train journey. The posters of the
Russian dancers were rather daring and seductive.
The Russian dancers themselves were the most
desolating stage spectacle that G.J. had ever
witnessed. The troupe consisted of intensely
English girls of various ages, and girl-children.
The costumes had obviously been fabricated by the
artistes. The artistes could neither dance, pose,
group, make an entrance, make an exit, nor even
smile. The ballets, obviously fabricated by the
same persons as the costumes, had no plot, no
beginning and no end. Crude amateurishness was
the characteristic of these honest and hard-working
professionals, who somehow contrived to be
neither men nor women&mdash;and assuredly not
epicene&mdash;but who travelled from country town to
country town in a glamour of posters, exciting the
towns, in spite of a perfect lack of sex, because
they were the fabled Russian dancers. The Moot
Hall was crammed with adults and their cackling
offspring, who heartily applauded the show, which
indeed was billed as a &quot;return visit&quot; due to
&quot;terrific success&quot; on a previous occasion. &quot;Is it
not too marvellous,&quot; Concepcion had said. He
had admitted that it was. But the boredom had
been excruciating. In the street they had bought
an evening paper of which he had never before
heard the name, to learn news of the war. The
<span class="newpage"><a name="page319" id="page319">[319]</a></span>
war, however, seemed very far off; it had grown
unreal. &quot;We'll talk to-morrow,&quot; Concepcion had
said, and gone abruptly to bed! Still, he had
slept well in the soft climate, to the everlasting
murmur of the weir.</p>

<p>Then the Sunday. She was indisposed, could
not come down to breakfast, but hoped to come
down to lunch, could not come down to lunch, but
hoped to come down to tea, could not come down
to tea&mdash;and so on to nightfall. The Sunday had
been like a thousand years to him. He had learnt
the town, and the suburbs of it; the grass-grown
streets, the main thoroughfares, and the slums;
by the afternoon he was recognising familiar faces
in the town. He had twice made the classic round&mdash;along
the cliffs, over the New Bridge (which was
an antique), up the hill to the castle, through the
market-place, down the High Street to the Old
Bridge. He had explored the brain of the landlord,
who could not grapple with a time-table, and
who spent most of the time during closed hours in
patiently bolting the front door which G.J. was
continually opening. He had talked to the old
customer who, whenever the house was open, sat
at a table in the garden over a mug of cider. He
had played through all the musical comedies,
dance albums and pianoforte albums that littered
the piano. He had read the same Sunday papers
that he read in the Albany. And he had learnt the
life-history of the sole servant, a very young
agreeable woman with a wedding-ring and a baby,
which baby she carried about with her when
serving at table. Her husband was in France. She
said that as soon as she had received his permission
<span class="newpage"><a name="page320" id="page320">[320]</a></span>
to do so she should leave, as she really could not
get through all the work of the hotel and mind
and feed a baby. She said also that she played
the piano herself. And she regretted that baby
and pressure of work had deprived her of a sight
of the Russian dancers, because she had heard so
much about them, and was sure they were
beautiful. This detail touched G.J.'s heart to a
mysterious and sweet and almost intolerable
melancholy. He had not made the acquaintance
of fellow-guests&mdash;for there were none, save
Concepcion and Emily.</p>

<p>And in the evening as in the morning the weir
placidly murmured, and the river slipped
smoothly between the huge jutting buttresses of
the Old Bridge; and the thought of the perpetuity
of the river, in whose mirror the venerable town
was a mushroom, obsessed him, mastered him, and
made him as old as the river. He was wonder-struck
and sorrow-struck by life, and by his own
life, and by the incomprehensible and angering
fantasy of Concepcion. His week-end took on the
appearance of the monstrous. Then the door
opened again, and Concepcion entered in a white
gown, the antithesis of her sporting costume of the
day before. She approached through the thickening
shadows of the room, and the vague whiteness
of her gown reminded him of the whiteness of the
form climbing the chimney-ladder on the roof of
Lechford House in the raid. Knowing her, he
ought to have known that, having made him
believe that she would not come down, she would
certainly come down. He restrained himself,
showed no untoward emotion, and said in a calm,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page321" id="page321">[321]</a></span>
genial voice: &quot;Oh! I'm so glad you were well
enough to come down.&quot;</p>

<p>She sat opposite to him in the window-seat,
rather sideways, so that her skirt was pulled close
round her left thigh and flowed free over the right.
He could see her still plainly in the dusk.</p>

<p>&quot;I've never yet apologised to you for my style
of behaviour at the committee of yours,&quot; she
began abruptly in a soft, kind, reasonable voice.
&quot;I know I let you down horribly. Yes, yes! I
did. And I ought to apologise to you for to-day
too. But I don't think I'll apologise to you for
bringing you to Wrikton and this place. They're
not real, you know. They're an illusion. There
is no such place as Wrikton and this river and this
window. There couldn't be, could there? Queen
and I motored over here once from Paulle&mdash;it's
not so very far&mdash;and we agreed that it didn't really
exist. I never forgot it; I was determined to come
here again some time, and that's why I chose
this very spot when half Harley Street stood up
and told me I must go away somewhere after my
cure and be by myself, far from the pernicious
influence of friends. I think I gave you a very
fair idea of the town yesterday. But I didn't show
you the funniest thing in it&mdash;the inside of a
solicitor's office. You remember the large grey
stone house in Mill Street&mdash;the grass street, you
know&mdash;with 'Simpover and Simpover' on the
brass plate, and the strip of green felt nailed all
round the front door to keep the wind out in
winter. Well, it's all in the same key inside. And
I don't know which is the funniest, the Russian
dancers, or the green felt round the front door,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page322" id="page322">[322]</a></span>
or Mr. Simpover, or the other Mr. Simpover.
I'm sure neither of those men is real, though
they both somehow have children. You remember
the yellow cards that you see in so many of
the windows: 'A MAN has gone from this house
to fight for King and Country!'&mdash;the elder Mr.
Simpover thinks it would be rather boastful to put
the card in the window, so he keeps it on the
mantelpiece in his private office. It's for his son.
And yet I assure you the father isn't real. He is
like the town, he simply couldn't be real.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What have <i>you</i> been up to in the private
office?&quot; G.J. asked lightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Making my will.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it the proper thing to do? I've left
everything to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You haven't, Con!&quot; he protested. There was
absolutely no tranquillity about this woman.
With her, the disconcerting unexpected happened
every five minutes.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you suppose I was going to send any of
my possessions back to my tropical relatives in
South America? I've left everything to you to
do what you like with. Squander it if you like,
but I expect you'll give it to war charities. Anyhow,
I thought it would be safest in your hands.&quot;</p>

<p>He retorted in a tone quietly and sardonically
challenging:</p>

<p>&quot;But I was under the impression you were
cured.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of my neurasthenia?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe I am. I gained thirteen pounds in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page323" id="page323">[323]</a></span>
the nursing home, and slept like a greengrocer.
In fact, the Weir-Mitchell treatment, with
modern improvements of course, enjoyed a
marvellous triumph in my case. But that's not the
point. G.J., I know you think I behaved very
childishly yesterday, and that I deserved to be ill
to-day for what I did yesterday. And I admit
you're a saint for not saying so. But I wasn't really
childish, and I haven't really been ill to-day.
I've only been in a devil of a dilemma. I wanted
to tell you something. I telegraphed for you so
that I could tell you. But as soon as I saw you I
was afraid to tell you. Not afraid, but I couldn't
make up my mind whether I ought to tell you or
not. I've lain in bed all day trying to decide the
point. To-night I decided I oughtn't, and then
all of a sudden, just now, I became an automaton
and put on some things, and here I am telling you.&quot;</p>

<p>She paused. G.J. kept silence. Then she
continued, in a voice in which persuasiveness was
added to calm, engaging reasonableness:</p>

<p>&quot;Now you must get rid of all your conventional
ideas, G.J. Because you're rather conventional.
You must be completely straight&mdash;I mean
intellectually&mdash;otherwise I can't treat you as an
intellectual equal, and I want to. You must be a
realist&mdash;if any man can be.&quot; She spoke almost
with tenderness.</p>

<p>He felt mysteriously shy, and with a brusque
movement of the head shifted his glance from her
to the river.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; he questioned, his gaze fixed on the
water that continually slipped in large, swirling,
glinting sheets under the bridge.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page324" id="page324">[324]</a></span>
<p>&quot;I'm going to kill myself.&quot;</p>

<p>At first the words made no impression on him.
He replied:</p>

<p>&quot;You were right when you said this place was
an illusion. It is.&quot;</p>

<p>And then he began to be afraid. Did she mean
it? She was capable of anything. And he was
involved in her, inescapably. Yes, he was afraid.
Nevertheless, as she kept silence he went on&mdash;with
bravado:</p>

<p>&quot;And how do you intend to do it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That will be my affair. But I venture to say
that my way of doing it will make Wrikton
historic,&quot; she said, curiously gentle.</p>

<p>&quot;Trust you!&quot; he exclaimed, suddenly looking
at her. &quot;Con, why <i>will</i> you always be so
theatrical?&quot;</p>

<p>She changed her posture for an easier one, half
reclining. Her face and demeanour seemed to
have the benign masculinity of a man's.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she answered. &quot;I oughtn't to have
said that. At any rate, to you. I ought to have had
more respect for your feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>&quot;You aren't cured. That's evident. All this is
physical.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course it's physical, G.J.,&quot; she agreed,
with an intonation of astonishment that he
should be guilty of an utterance so obvious
and banal. &quot;Did you ever know anything that
wasn't? Did you ever even conceive anything
that wasn't? If you can show me how to conceive
spirit except in terms of matter, I'd like to listen to
you.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page325" id="page325">[325]</a></span>
<p>&quot;It's against nature&mdash;to kill yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she murmured. &quot;I'm quite used to
that charge. You aren't by any means the first
to accuse me of being against nature. But can
you tell me where nature ends? That's another
thing I'd like to know.... My dear friend, you're
being conventional, and you aren't being realistic.
You must know perfectly well in your heart that
there's no reason why I shouldn't kill myself if I
want to. You aren't going to talk to me about the
Ten Commandments, I suppose, are you? There's
a risk, of course, on the other side&mdash;shore&mdash;but
perhaps it's worth taking. You aren't in a position
to say it isn't worth taking. And at worst the
other shore must be marvellous. It may possibly
be terrible, if you arrive too soon and without
being asked, but it must be marvellous....
Naturally, I believe in immortality. If I didn't,
the thing wouldn't be worth doing. Oh! I should
hate to be extinguished. But to change one
existence for another, if the fancy takes you&mdash;that
seems to me the greatest proof of real
independence that anybody can give. It's
tremendous. You're playing chess with fate and
fate's winning, and you knock up the chess-board
and fate has to begin all over again! Can't you
see how tremendous it is&mdash;and how tempting it
is? The temptation is terrific.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can see all that,&quot; said G.J. He was surprised
by a sudden sense of esteem for the mighty
volition hidden behind those calm, worn, gracious
features. But Concepcion's body was younger
than her face. He perceived, as it were for the
first time, that Concepcion was immeasurably
<span class="newpage"><a name="page326" id="page326">[326]</a></span>
younger than himself; and yet she had passed far
beyond him in experience. &quot;But what's the
origin of all this? What do you want to do it for?
What's happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you believe I mean to do it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied sincerely, and as naturally
as he could.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the tone I like to hear,&quot; said she,
smiling. &quot;I felt sure I could count on you not to
indulge in too much nonsense. Well, I'm going
to try the next avatar just to remind fate of my
existence. I think fate's forgotten me, and I can
stand anything but that. I've lost Carly, and I've
lost Queen.... Oh, G.J.! Isn't it awful to think
that when I offered you Queen she'd already gone,
and it was only her dead body I was offering
you? ... And I've lost my love. And I've failed, and
I shall never be any more good here. I swore I
would see a certain thing through, and I haven't
seen it through, and I can't! But I've told you all
this before.... What's left? Even my unhappiness
is leaving me. Unless I kill myself I shall cease
to exist. Don't you understand? Yes, you do.&quot;</p>

<p>After a marked pause she added:</p>

<p>&quot;And I may overtake Queen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's one thing I don't understand,&quot; he
said, &quot;as we're being frank with each other. Why
do you tell me? Has it occurred to you that you're
really making me a party to this scheme of yours?&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke with a perfectly benevolent detachment
deriving from hers. And as he spoke he
thought of a man whom he had once known and
who had committed suicide, and of all that he had
read about suicides and what he had thought of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page327" id="page327">[327]</a></span>
them. Suicides had been incomprehensible to
him, and either despicable or pitiable. And he
said to himself: &quot;Here is one of them! (Or is it
an illusion?) But she has made all my notions of
suicide seem ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p>She answered his spoken question with vivacity:
&quot;Why do I tell you? I don't know. That's the
point I've been arguing to myself all night and
all day. <i>I'm</i> not telling you. Something <i>in</i> me is
forcing me to tell you. Perhaps it's much more
important that you should comprehend me than
that you should be spared the passing worry that
I'm causing you by showing you the inside of my
head. You're the only friend I have left. I knew
you before I knew Carly. I practically committed
suicide from my particular world at the
beginning of the war. I was going back to my
particular world&mdash;you remember, G.J., in that
little furnished flat&mdash;I was going back to it, but
you wouldn't let me. It was you who definitely
cut me off from my past. I might have been
gadding about safely with Sarah Churcher and
her lot at this very hour, but you would have it
otherwise, and so I finished up with neurasthenia.
You commanded and I obeyed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, ignoring all her utterance
except the last words, &quot;obey me again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want me to do?&quot; she demanded
wistfully and yet defiantly. Her features were
tending to disappear in the tide of night, but she
happened to sit up and lean forward and bring
them a little closer to him. &quot;You've no right to
stop me from doing what I want to do. What
right have you to stop me? Besides, you can't
<span class="newpage"><a name="page328" id="page328">[328]</a></span>
stop me. Nothing can stop me. It is settled.
Everything is arranged.&quot;</p>

<p>He, too, sat up and leaned forward. In a voice
rendered soft by the realisation of the fact that he
had indeed known her before Carlos Smith knew
her and had imagined himself once to be in love
with her, and of the harshness of her destiny and
the fading of her glory, he said simply and yet, in
spite of himself, insinuatingly:</p>

<p>&quot;No! I don't claim any right to stop you. I
understand better, perhaps, than you think. But
let me come down again next week-end. Do let
me,&quot; he insisted, still more softly.</p>

<p>Even while he was speaking he expected her to
say, &quot;You're only suggesting that in order to gain
time.&quot;</p>

<p>But she said:</p>

<p>&quot;How can you be sure it wouldn't be my
inquest and funeral I should be 'letting' you come
down to?&quot;</p>

<p>He replied:</p>

<p>&quot;I could trust you.&quot;</p>

<p>A delicate night-gust charged with the scent
of some plant came in at the open window and
deranged ever so slightly a glistening lock on her
forehead. G.J., peering at her, saw the masculinity
melt from her face. He saw the mysterious
resurrection of the girl in her, and felt in himself
the sudden exciting outflow from her of that
temperamental fluid whose springs had been dried
up since the day when she learnt of her widowhood.
She flushed. He looked away into the dark
water, as though he had profanely witnessed that
which ought not to be witnessed. Earlier in the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page329" id="page329">[329]</a></span>
interview she had inspired him with shyness. He
was now stirred, agitated, thrilled&mdash;overwhelmed
by the effect on her of his own words and his own
voice. He was afraid of his power, as a prophet
might be afraid of his power. He had worked a
miracle&mdash;a miracle infinitely more convincing
than anything that had led up to it. The miracle
had brought back the reign of reality.</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; she quivered.</p>

<p>And there was a movement and she was gone.
He glanced quickly behind him, but the room lay
black.... A transient pallor on the blackness,
and the door banged. He sat a long time, solemn,
gazing at the serrated silhouette of the town
against a sky that obstinately held the wraith of
daylight, and listening to the everlasting murmur
of the invisible weir. Not a sound came from the
town, not the least sound. When at length he
stumbled out, he saw the figure of the landlord
smoking the pipe of philosophy, and waiting with
a landlord's fatalism for the last guest to go to
bed. And they talked of the weather.</p>

<h4>THE ENVOY</h4>
<br />

<p>The next night G.J., having been hailed by
an acquaintance, was talking at the top of the
steps beneath the portal of a club in Piccadilly. It
was after ten by the clocks, and nearly, but not
quite, dark. A warm, rather heavy, evening
shower had ceased. This was the beginning of the
great macintosh epoch, by-product of the war,
when the paucity of the means of vehicular
locomotion had rendered macintoshes permissible,
even for women with pretensions to smartness;
and at intervals stylish girls on their way home
from unaccustomed overtime, passed the doors in
transparent macintoshes of pink, yellow or green,
as scornful as military officers of the effeminate
umbrella, whose use was being confined to clubmen
and old dowdies.</p>

<p>The acquaintance sought advice from G.J.
about the shutting up of households for Belgian
refugees. G.J. answered absently, not concealing
that he was in a hurry. He had, in fact, been held
up within three minutes of the scene of his secret
idyll, and was anxious to arrive there. He had
promised himself this surprise visit to Christine as
some sort of recompense and narcotic for the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page331" id="page331">[331]</a></span>
immense disturbance of spirit which he had
suffered at Wrikton.</p>

<p>That morning Concepcion had been invisible,
but at his early breakfast he had received a note
from her, a brief but masterly composition, if ever
so slightly theatrical. He was conscious of tenderness
for Concepcion, of sympathy with her, of a
desire to help to restore her to that which by misfortune
she had lost. But the first of these sentiments
he resolutely put aside. He was determined
to change his mood towards her for the sake of his
own tranquillity; and he had convinced himself
that his wise, calm, common sense was capable of
saving her from any tragic and fatal folly. He
had her in the hollow of his hand; but if she was
expecting too much from him she would be
gradually disappointed. He must have peace; he
could not allow a bomb to be thrown into his
habits; he was a bachelor of over fifty whose habits
had the value of inestimable jewels and whose
perfect independence was the most precious thing
in the world. At his age he could not marry a
volcano, a revolution, a new radio-active element
exhibiting properties which were an enigma to
social science. Concepcion would turn his existence
into an endless drama of which she alone,
with her deep-rooted, devilish talent for the
sensational, would always choose the setting, as
she had chosen the window and the weir. No; he
must not mistake affectionate sympathy for
tenderness, nor tolerate the sexual exploitation of
his pity.</p>

<p>As he listened and talked to the acquaintance
his inner mind shifted with relief to the vision of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page332" id="page332">[332]</a></span>
Christine, contented and simple and compliant in
her nest&mdash;Christine, at once restful and exciting,
Christine, the exquisite symbol of acquiescence
and response. What a contrast to Concepcion!
It had been a bold and sudden stroke to lift
Christine to another plane, but a stroke well
justified and entirely successful, fulfilling his
dream.</p>

<p>At this moment he noticed a figure pass the
doorway in whose shadow he was, and he
exclaimed within himself incredulously:</p>

<p>&quot;That is Christine!&quot;</p>

<p>In the shortest possible delay he said &quot;Good-night&quot;
to his acquaintance, and jumped down the
steps and followed eastwards the figure. He
followed warily, for already the strange and
distressing idea had occurred to him that he must
not overtake her&mdash;if she it was. It was she. He
caught sight of her again in the thick obscurity by
the prison-wall of Devonshire House. He recognised
the peculiar brim of the new hat and the
new &quot;military&quot; umbrella held on the wrist by a
thong.</p>

<p>What was she doing abroad? She could not be
going to a theatre. She had not a friend in London.
He was her London. And la m&egrave;re Gaston was not
with her. Theoretically, of course, she was free.
He had laid down no law. But it had been clearly
understood between them that she should never
emerge at night alone. She herself had promulgated
the rule, for she had a sense of propriety
and a strong sense of reality. She had belonged
to the class which respectable, broadminded
women, when they bantered G.J., always called
<span class="newpage"><a name="page333" id="page333">[333]</a></span>
&quot;the pretty ladies,&quot; and as a postulant for
respectability she had for her own satisfaction to
mind her p's and q's. She could not afford not to
keep herself above suspicion.</p>

<p>She had been a courtesan. Did she look like
one? As an individual figure in repose, no!
None could have said that she did. He had long
since learnt that to decide always correctly by
appearance, and apart from environment and
gesture, whether an unknown woman was or
was not a wanton, presented a task beyond the
powers of even the completest experience. But
Christine was walking in Piccadilly at night, and
he soon perceived that she was discreetly showing
the demeanour of a courtesan at her profession&mdash;she
who had hated and feared the pavement!
He knew too well the signs&mdash;the waverings,
the turns of the head, the variations in speed,
the scarcely perceptible hesitations, the unmistakable
air of wandering with no definite
objective.</p>

<p>Near Dover Street he hastened through the
thin, reflecting mire, amid beams of light and
illuminated numbers that advanced upon him in
both directions thundering or purring, and crossed
Piccadilly, and hurried ahead of her, to watch her
in safety from the other side of the thoroughfare.
He could hardly see her; she was only a moving
shadow; but still he could see her; and in the
long stretch of gloom beneath the facade of the
Royal Academy he saw the shadow pause in front
of a military figure, which by a flank movement
avoided the shadow and went resolutely forward.
He lost her in front of the Piccadilly Hotel, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page334" id="page334">[334]</a></span>
found her again at the corner of Air Street. She
swerved into Air Street and crossed Regent Street;
he was following. In Denman Street, close to
Shaftesbury Avenue, she stood still in front of
another military figure&mdash;a common soldier as it
proved&mdash;who also rebuffed her. The thing was
flagrant. He halted, and deliberately let her go
from his sight. She vanished into the dark crowds
of the Avenue.</p>

<p>In horrible humiliation, in atrocious disgust,
he said to himself:</p>

<p>&quot;Never will I set eyes on her again! Never!
Never!&quot;</p>

<p>Why was she doing it? Not for money. She
could only be doing it from the nostalgia of
adventurous debauch. She was the slave of her
temperament, as the drunkard is the slave of his
thirst. He had told her that he would be out of
town for the week end, on committee business.
He had distinctly told her that she must on no
account expect him on the Monday night. And
her temperament had roused itself from the
obscene groves of her subconsciousness like a tiger
and come up and driven her forth. How easy
for her to escape from la m&egrave;re Gaston if she chose!
And yet&mdash;would she dare, even at the bidding of
the tiger, to introduce a stranger into the flat?
Unnecessary, he reflected. There were a hundred
accommodating dubious interiors between Shaftesbury
Avenue and Leicester Square. He understood;
he neither accused nor pardoned; but he
was utterly revolted, and wounded not merely in
his soul but in the most sensitive part of his soul&mdash;his
pride. He called himself by the worst epithet
<span class="newpage"><a name="page335" id="page335">[335]</a></span>
of opprobrium: Simpleton! The bold and sudden
stroke had now become the fatuous caprice of a
damned fool. Had he, at his age, been capable
of overlooking the elementary axiom: once
a wrong 'un, always a wrong 'un? Had he
believed in reclamation? He laughed out his
disgust ...</p>

<p>No! He did not blame her. To blame her
would have been ridiculous. She was only what
she was, and not worth blame. She was nothing
at all. How right, how cursedly right, were
the respectable dames in the accent of amused
indifference which they employed for their
precious phrase, &quot;the pretty ladies&quot;! Well, he
would treat her generously&mdash;but through his
lawyer.</p>

<p>And in the desolation, the dismay, the disillusion,
the nausea which ravaged him he was
unwillingly conscious of fragments of thoughts
that flickered like transient flames far below in the
deep mines of his being.... &quot;You are an astounding
woman, Con.&quot; ... &quot;Do you want me to go
to the bad altogether?&quot; ... In offering him Queen
had not Concepcion made the supreme double
sacrifice of attempting to bring together, at the
price of her own separation from both of them,
the two beings to whom she was most profoundly
attached? It was a marvellous deed.... Worry,
volcanoes, revolutions&mdash;was he afraid of them?...
Were they not the very essence of life?... A
figure of nobility!... Sitting there now by the
window over the river, listening to the weir....
&quot;I shall never be any more good.&quot; ... But she
never had a gesture that was not superb.... Was
<span class="newpage"><a name="page336" id="page336">[336]</a></span>
he really encrusted in habits? Really like men
whom he knew and despised at his club?... She
loved him.... And what rich, flattering love was
her love compared to&mdash;!... She was young....
Tenderness.... Such were the flames of dim
promise that nickered immeasurably beneath the
dark devastation of his mind. He ignored them,
but he could not ignore them. He extinguished
them, but they were continually relighted....
A wedding?... What sort of a wedding?...
Poor Carlos, pathetically buried under the ruthless
happiness of others! What a shame!... Poor
Carlos!</p>

<p>(Nice enough little cocotte, nothing else! But,
of course, incurable!... He remembered all her
crimes now. How she had been late in dressing
for their first dinner. Her inexplicable vanishing
from the supper-party, never explained, but easily
explicable now, perhaps. And so on and so on....
Simpleton! Ass!)</p>

<p>He had walked heedless of direction. He was
near Lechford House. Many of its windows were
lit. The great front doors were open. A commissionaire
stood on guard in front of them. To
the railings was affixed a newly-painted notice:
&quot;No person will be allowed to enter these premises
without a pass. To this rule there is no exception.&quot;
Lechford House had been &quot;taken over&quot; in its
entirety by a Government department that
believed in the virtue of mystery and of long
hours. He looked up at the higher windows. He
could not distinguish the chimney amid the
newly-revealed stars. He thought of Queen,
the white woman. Evidently he had never
<span class="newpage"><a name="page337" id="page337">[337]</a></span>
understood Queen, for if Concepcion admired
her she was worth admiration. Concepcion never
made a mistake in assessing fundamental
character.</p>

<p>The complete silent absorption of Lechford
House into the war-machine rather dismayed him.
He had seen not a word as to the affair in the
newspapers&mdash;and Lechford House was one of the
final strongholds of privilege! He strolled on into
the quietness of the Park&mdash;of which one of the
gate-keepers said to him that it would be shutting
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>He was in solitude, and surrounded by
London. He stood still, and the vast sea of war
seemed to be closing over him. The war was
growing, or the sense of its measureless scope
was growing. It had sprung, not out of this
crime or that, but out of the secret invisible
roots of humanity, and it was widening to the
limits of evolution itself. It transcended judgment.
It defied conclusions and rendered equally
impossible both hope and despair. His pride in
his country was intensified as months passed; his
faith in his country was not lessened. And yet,
wherein was the efficacy of grim words about
British tenacity? The great new Somme offensive
was not succeeding in the North. Was victory
possible? Was victory deserved? In his daily
labour he was brought into contact with too many
instances of official selfishness, folly, ignorance,
stupidity, and sloth, French as well as British, not
to marvel at times that the conflict had not come
to an ignominious end long ago through simple
lack of imagination. He knew that he himself
<span class="newpage"><a name="page338" id="page338">[338]</a></span>
had often failed in devotion, in rectitude, in sheer
grit.</p>

<p>The supreme lesson of the war was its revelation
of what human nature actually was. And the
solace of the lesson, the hope for triumph, lay in
the fact that human nature must be substantially
the same throughout the world. If we were
humanly imperfect, so at least was the
enemy.</p>

<p>Perhaps the frame of society was about to
collapse. Perhaps Queen, deliberately courting
destruction, and being destroyed, was the symbol
of society. What matter? Perhaps civilisation, by
its nobility and its elements of reason, and by the
favour of destiny, would be saved from disaster
after frightful danger, and Concepcion was its
symbol....</p>

<p>All he knew was that he had a heavy day's work
before him on the morrow, and in relief from pain
and insoluble problems he turned to face that
work, thankful; thankful that (owing originally to
Queen!) he had discovered in the war a task which
suited his powers, which was genuinely useful, and
which would only finish with the war; thankful
for the prospect of meeting Concepcion at the
week-end and exploring with her the marvellous
provocative potentialities that now drew them
together; thankful, too, that he had a balanced
and sagacious mind, and could judge justly. (Yes,
he was already forgetting his bitter condemnation
of himself as a simpleton!)</p>

<p>How in his human self-sufficiency could he be
expected to know that he had judged the negligible
Christine unjustly? Was he divine that he could
<span class="newpage"><a name="page339" id="page339">[339]</a></span>
see in the figure of the wanton who peered at
soldiers in the street a self-convinced mystic envoy
of the most clement Virgin, an envoy passionately
repentant after apostasy, bound at all costs to
respond to an imagined voice long unheard, and
seeking&mdash;though in vain this second time&mdash;the
prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Virgin so that she might once more
succour and assuage his affliction?</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://gutenberg.net/etext06/">http://gutenberg.net/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
