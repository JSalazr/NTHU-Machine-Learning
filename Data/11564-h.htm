<h2>
	PREFACE.
</h2>



<hr />

<p>
Whoever has read the <i>Preface</i> to the FARMER'S BOY will hardly fail of
recollecting the Name of NATHANIEL BLOOMFIELD; the Author of the POEMS
here offer'd to The Public.
</p>

<p>
It will be recollected that he there appears, with his Brother GEORGE
BLOOMFIELD, standing in the place of the Father, whom they had early
lost, to their younger Brother ROBERT.
</p>

<p>
It is natural to suppose that this brotherly interference, and it's
consequences, greatly and advantageously influenc'd the dispositions,
pursuits, and habits of thought and conduct, of all three of the
Brothers.&mdash;And it is the more exemplary when it is consider'd how young
the two eldest were at that time.
</p>

<p>
It is an encouraging instance how much may be effected for each other
by the poor and uneducated, if they have prudence, activity, and kind
affections; and how unexpectedly, and to an extent far beyond apparent
probability, success is given by Providence to virtuous and benevolent
efforts.
</p>

<p>
Beyond question, the Brothers of this Family are all extraordinary Men:
and perhaps every one of them is more so than he would have been without
the fraternal concord which has animated them all, and multiplied the
powers of all by union and sympathy.
</p>

<p>
Of NATHANIEL, as of ROBERT, my Account shall be taken from
communications by Letter, made at my request by Mr. GEORGE BLOOMFIELD.
</p>

<p>
NATHANIEL BLOOMFIELD was born 23d Feb.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> 1759.
</p>

<p>
He was the 3d Child and 2d Son of GEORGE BLOOMFIELD, of <i>Honington</i>: and
was deprived of his Father, by the Small-pox, when he was <i>eight</i> years
old. Like ROBERT, he learnt to read and write of his MOTHER: and had,
like him, his farther instructions in <i>Writing</i>, and was taught the
first Rules of <i>Arithmetic</i>, by Mr. RODWELL, of <i>Ixworth</i><a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>: where also
he seems to have had some instruction in <i>Grammar</i>. But his Mother being
then a <i>widow</i>, his Grandfather (Mr. ROBIN MANBY) kindly bound him
Apprentice to Mr. HAYLETT, a <i>Tailor</i> of <i>Market-Harling</i>: of which
business the Father of the BLOOMFIELDS had been.
</p>

<p>
He was here very kindly treated: and was found to be an excellent
Apprentice.
</p>

<p>
While here he learnt <i>Church Music</i>, (one of the great consolations of
energetic and pensive minds) and sung in a company which was conducted
by Mr. SYDER. But when his voice broke, he could make no figure among
them: for it was not only a Bass of extremely narrow compass, but <i>weak</i>
and <i>tremulous</i>.
</p>

<p>
This latter defect of voice was observ'd in THOMSON: and perhaps it may
arise sometimes not from a fault in the natural quality of the voice,
but from exceeding sensibility to <i>Poetry</i> and <i>Music</i>.
</p>

<p>
When about 16 or 17 years of age he entered with the fervor of a
vigorous and thoughtful mind into the study of <i>Religion</i>, on the
principles of the <i>Church</i> of <i>England</i>: and added to his study of it
what is the great end, the <i>practice</i> of Religion as a rule of conduct
and life.
</p>

<p>
At a stall at <i>Harling Fair</i> he met with a <i>Practical Catechism</i>: the
Author's name, PRATT: and at the same time he made the acquisition of a
large volume of TILLOTSON'S Sermons. Probably the Folio Edition of the
Sermons of that excellent Man and <i>Writer</i>: so distinguish'd by his
Piety, uniform, mild, and rational; the morality of his excellent
Discourses; their simplicity and clearness; and the sweetness and
persuasiveness of manner. These, and other religious Tracts, he bought:
and "the last" (<i>Tillotson</i>) "he lent," says Mr. GEORGE BLOOMFIELD, "to
me. I receiv'd many excellent Letters from him on that subject: and they
had greater weight on my mind than if they had been written by an elder
hand."
</p>

<p>
When his <i>Apprenticeship</i> expir'd he came to LONDON: and expected to
find his Brother GEORGE there. But GEORGE had taken a trip, "or tramp,
as it is called," into <i>Kent</i>. They however soon met in LONDON: "and
there never lived" (adds GEORGE) "a more pleasant acquaintance than
he prov'd."
</p>

<p>
It was some years before he could procure work in LONDON sufficient to
support him through the <i>dead</i> Months. He us'd therefore, when he found
trade dull in Town, to go into the Country.
</p>

<p>
And thus, while at <i>Woolwich</i>, he became acquainted with CHARLOTTE
NOBLE, whom he MARRIED 4th March, 1787; he being then in his 28th, and
she in her 17th year. Her Mother was a Widow: who kept a small General
Shop. Her Brother-in-law GEORGE, in speaking of this union, says, "There
perhaps never liv'd a Woman who possess'd a better temper: and he has,
though very poor, been exceedingly happy." For myself, I wish, in
transcribing this account, that those who think riches so essential to
happiness that they will take no step in life, nor suffer their hearts
or their understandings to have any influence with them, if the
acquisition of riches seems likely to be delayed or endanger'd, would
consider that the Family of the BLOOMFIELDS has been happy, and has
excell'd, upon very different principles. And if we would compare the
thousands in every situation of Life to whom what is called <i>prosperity</i>
is a snare, a burthen and a curse, with those who are happy with mere
necessaries, and those with difficulty obtain'd; ... happy by their
Affections and their Virtues; by improv'd and generous and tender
Feelings; by Hope amid difficulties, and Confidence in Heaven amid
trials and distresses, ... it might be seen and felt that there is more
of folly in the wisdom of the world, than those who place Wisdom in
the accumulation of superfluities, to the neglect of the most natural
Blessings, and often in violation of the clearest Duties, either of
<i>Justice</i> or of <i>Benevolence</i>, may be willing to acknowledge.
</p>

<p>
He has <i>two</i> Children living:&mdash;ELIZABETH; born 11th <i>Jul</i>. 1789; GEORGE;
4th <i>Febr.</i> 1797. "He lost," adds his Brother, "two sweet Boys: who both
died within a few days of each other, by that dreadful disease the
SMALL-POX;" which, while this Preface was in the Press, has been fatal
to another promising Child, THOMAS; born <i>Aug</i>. 1799. The Father,
oppress'd with grief, reproaches himself for not having inoculated this
Child with the Small-Pox. But when it is consider'd how formidable,
after two such Losses, the SMALL-POX in any form must appear to
affectionate Parents, I think it will be evident that he is too severe
to himself in this reproach. The inoculated SMALL-POX is sometimes
fatal: had he inoculated the Child he would have reproach'd himself,
and still with more feeling than justice, for so doing.
</p>

<p>
He had read but little Poetry when he came to LONDON: but he had not
been long there before he was struck, looking, as was his custom, at
Books on a stall, with the Title of NIGHT THOUGHTS. "He had never heard
of it before: but it's name was an irresistible charm to his melancholy,
enquiring mind. This has been ever his favourite Book. He would have
bought it had it been double the price. And as he possesses an
uncommonly retentive memory, he us'd to repeat great part of it by
rote in his walks with his Brothers. He afterwards read MILTON."
</p>

<p>
Such a Memory, and the study of two such Authors with poetic enthusiasm,
may in part account for what exceedingly surpriz'd me in reading the
MSS. of THE ESSAY ON WAR:&mdash;a greater mastery in the mechanism, and
greater power of numbers, than I should have almost thought possible
in the first attempt in BLANK VERSE; even to a person of the best
education.
</p>

<p>
He read too, GOLDSMITH and FIELDING. And he added to these some of our
English Poets as they fell in his way. Among these THOMSON could hardly
fail to be: but Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD remarks, "he never was so struck with
THOMSON as I should have expected."
</p>

<p>
While single, he made it the amusement of his evenings to read
<i>Entick's Dictionary</i>, and write down every word of which he wish'd to
remember the spelling or the meaning. He has often said that since his
buying of the Sermons in his early youth, he had never bought for his
own reading any but <i>poetical</i> Books: and when he could get hold of any
miscellaneous Book, he read first the Poetry, and after look'd at no
other part.
</p>

<p>
With this turn of Mind and habit of reading, that he has through Life
indulg'd in poetical effusions will be no matter of surprize. But be has
more than once said to his Brother GEORGE in Letters, that it was the
success of ROBERT that encouraged him to attempt an <i>Essay on War:</i> a
subject on which he had occupied his thoughts a great length of time.
</p>

<p>
"I remember," says his Brother, "nothing particular of his infancy:
except the great share of bashfulness (or, as a Philosopher perhaps
would say, pride) which he possess'd in common with the rest of the
Family.... Exceedingly mild in his temper and kind to his play-mates,
he was very apt in learning."
</p>

<p>
For the last 15 years his own Account is that he has certainty read
but little: his Family having claim'd his utmost exertions; and his
business allowing little leisure. And what leisure he had being
generally employed in walking with his Children. Untill last Summer he
was a <i>Journeyman</i> Tailor: but has since been a MASTER in a small way.
If therefore he appears to possess any knowledge of a litterary nature,
it must be all from the stores of Memory.
</p>

<p>
He at present lives at No. 19, <i>Dagget Court, Broker Row, Moorfields,
London</i>. He is (says Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD) about 5F. 3I. high<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>: of a dark
complexion, and dark gray eyes: he has lost the hair from the top of
his head, which gives him the appearance of Age. Though remarkable for
talking little, so as to have the name of a man of few words, he is,
on occasion, a chearful companion: and though generally pensive and
melancholy, ever kind-hearted.
</p>

<p>
"As a Husband and Father, his character is certainly exemplary. And few
men pass through Life so smoothly. Though commonly working with a number
of shop-mates, he has such a philosophical command of temper, that he
never disputes; nor concerns himself with the disputes of others, unless
they refer to him for a decision."
</p>

<p>
Thus far the Account by his Brother: who had observ'd in a former
Letter, that with respect to <i>Temper</i>, what he should otherwise have to
speak of NATHANIEL, he had in a great measure said already of ROBERT.
Such a coincidence in mild and simple manners, amiable and good
disposition, is pleasing to remark any where: and additionally so when
it relates to Men who have each original and characteristic Genius; and
when the testimony is given by a Brother so capable of judging, and who
has had such continued experience from their very early Life, of the
Disposition and Character of both.
</p>

<p>
Having spoken thus far of the AUTHOR, from the best authority, it
remains for me to say something briefly of these his WORKS.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Early in the <i>Spring</i> of 1801, I saw in MSS. HONINGTON-GREEN, and the
ESSAY ON WAR<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>. I communicated them to Mr. GEDGE, <i>Printer</i>, of BURY;
who had been a zealous and active Friend to THE FARMER'S BOY: on reading
them, he wanted no time for deliberation, but offer'd at once to print
them for the benefit of the Author, at his own risque. I had known his
accuracy as a Printer: of which, and of neat Typography, I flatter
myself this Publication will be a proof. I had no difficulty to adopt
the proposal: and gladly offer'd, on my part, what little preparation
(very little indeed it was) might be necessary of the MSS. for the
Press; (or rather in it's progress through it); and to revise and
correct the Proofs.
</p>

<p>
My province has been quite of a similar kind in this instance as it
was in that of Mr. ROBERT BLOOMFIELD: little corrections, in point
of Orthography; and still fewer of Grammar: sometimes of Diction; and
sometimes of Versification. For some of the best of these emendations
I have been indebted to one, in mentioning of whom I should have had
an affectionate Pride: and have more in that Modesty which forbids the
mention. They are, as I have said, few of any kind: For of emendations I
have been anxiously sparing. Little was requisite: and more than was so
would have been blameable. I rely on the original MSS. being preserv'd:
which on this, as on the former occasion, will speak for itself.
</p>

<p>
I have said what I thought of THE FARMER'S BOY. It is a truely
agricultural Poem: it's originality and vivid representation of
immediate Nature manifest themselves in the whole Design, and in every
page. It will live with the works of HESIOD and THEOCRITUS; of VIRGIL
and THOMSON. I was nearly as much assur'd of this from the first, and so
express'd myself, as the event could assure me. I will now say with the
same freedom what I think of the ESSAY ON WAR.
</p>

<p>
I regard it as a Poem of extraordinary vigor and originality: in
Thought, Plan, Conduct, Language, and Versification. I think it has much
indeed of the philosophic character, poetic spirit, force of coloring,
energy and pathos, which distinguish LUCRETIUS. Of the justness and
spirit of the VERSIFICATION I have already spoken.
</p>

<p>
The PRINCIPLE of the ESSAY ON WAR appears to me, I will own, more
paradoxical than I should think, to judge from their conduct, it can
appear to the ruling part at least of Mankind in general. I indulge the
hope and expectation that WAR shall one day be universally and finally
extinguish'd. But I will confess also, that appearances would tempt us
to apprehend that day is far distant. And while we make War for Sport on
useful, generous, inoffensive Animals, it is not easy to imagine that we
shall cease to make War on one another.
</p>

<p>
But whether the Principle of the Poem be well or ill-founded, I can
hardly imagine any abstract proposition to be more poetically, more
forcibly, or more comprehensively maintain'd. And I am either ignorant
wherein Genius consists, or it is manifest in the Idea, the Style and
Numbers, the Design and Conduct of this Poem.
</p>

<p>
Of HONINGTON GREEN I am to speak next. And here it may be right to
obviate some prejudice against the Poem, which, in the minds of several,
may arise from the subject. I am not an Enemy to Enclosures: if the
RIGHTS and INTERESTS of the POOR, and of SMALL OWNERS, be very carefully
guarded, an ENCLOSURE may be a common Benefit. However, it is very
liable to become otherwise. But be an Enclosure good or bad, (and every
Man has a right to his opinion, and to support it by argument, on this
subject and every other) there are particular circumstances and
considerations which stand clear of the scope of the general question.
The Spot which is the subject of the Ballad is less, I believe, than
Half an Acre. It did certainly ornament the Village; independent of a
just and laudable partiality in the Author. Thus it would have seem'd to
the casual glance of a stranger. To the BLOOMFIELDS every circumstance
gave it peculiar endearment. There the Author of 'THE FARMER'S BOY,' and
of these POEMS, first drew breath. There grew the first Daisies which
their feet pressed in childhood. On this little Green their Parents
look'd with delight: and the Children caught the affection; and learn'd
to love it as soon as they lov'd any thing. By it's smallness and it's
situation it was no object: and could have been left out of Enclosure
without detriment to the General Plan, or to any individual Interest.
I wish it had: and most who love Poetry, and respect Genius, and are
anxious to preserve the little innocent Gratifications of the Poor,
will have the same wish.
</p>

<p>
As a poetical effusion, it strikes me that it has the tone, simplicity,
and sweetness, and pleasing Melancholy of the Ballad. There is a stroke
or two of indignant severity: but the general character is such as I
have describ'd. And with filial Gratitude and Love there is blended,
in the close, that turn for Reflection which is so remarkable in this
Author.... I wish'd and recommended that some at least of the ornaments
of 'THE FARMER'S BOY' should be sketches of <i>local scenery</i>: knowing
how much more interesting they would have been, and how much more
appropriate to the Poem. In that recommendation I was not successful:
but I am glad, in this instance, to see a faithful and agreeable Sketch
of <i>Honington-Green</i> from a very young pencil<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>. It will be remember'd,
at a far remote Period, that the double Cottage at the end of the Green
was the Birth-place of the BLOOMFIELDS. It is still, (and may it yet be
long so) the habitation of their <i>Mother</i>: and has been repair'd lately
by ROBERT. And I much doubt whether any House or Green will see two such
Poets born of the same Parents.
</p>

<p>
THE CULPRIT is the next in this Collection, and I had not seen it, nor
was it written, when I saw the two first. They decided my Opinion; and
had no more appeared, they would have been publish'd alone; as they
abundantly deserved.
</p>

<p>
THE CULPRIT strikes me as an original and highly affecting Poem. The
very attempt to sketch the successive conflicting feelings of one thus
circumstanc'd is no common effort. And what compass of thought; what
energy of expression! ... I do not always admit the justness of the
arguments. But it is a Soliloquy in <i>character</i>: and in judging of it,
as in all pieces of <i>representative</i> Poetry (as Mr. DYER, in his lately
publish'd ESSAY has well term'd it) the imagin'd situation ought to be
consider'd. And it strikes me as closing with a true and aweful Pathos:
not often equall'd.
</p>

<p>
The YORKSHIRE DIP is, I think, the result of that active but melancholy
Fancy, which can travel far into views of Life and Nature from a slight
occasion. It has a mixture of the Sportive which deepens the impression
of it's melancholy Close. I could have wish'd, as I have said in a short
Note, the Conclusion had been otherwise. The sours of Life less offend
my Taste than its sweets delight it. But when I think what NATHANIEL
must have felt in passing through Life, I more respect the Chearfulness
and habitual Vigor of his Mind, than I am dispos'd to be out of humor
with occasional gloom.
</p>

<p>
LOVE'S TRIUMPH differs as much in manner as in subject from those which
precede it. Yet a vein of pensive and philosophic thought flows here
also. The SONG OF BALDWIN is well adapted to soothe the fears and the
discontents of Poverty: and to convince those who have not learnt it,
that wealth, and rank, and power, and unlimited indulgence, are not such
Blessings as they are imagin'd to be at a distance: nor Poverty such an
Evil, that the first and best Blessings of Nature should be therefore
thrown aside in despair.
</p>

<p>
I may doubt on the <i>expediency</i> of the SONG OF BALDWIN being in a
different measure; but I can not doubt of the general merit of the Poem.
</p>

<p>
The PROVERBS, like other compositions of this kind, must rest chiefly on
their moral Justness, Utility, Simplicity, and Conciseness, rather than
on poetic Excellence: though neither in form nor coloring are they
deficient of that compos'd and grave Beauty which the Nature of the
Subject and Composition admits.
</p>

<p>
MORE BREAD AND CHEESE contains the Principle of the ESSAY ON WAR, and of
a celebrated ESSAY ON POPULATION, which I dare say the Author never saw.
It is strong, characteristic; and original: and although in the measure
of the <i>humorous</i> Ballad, has much nerve and energy<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>

<p>
I have now a Remark to make which relates generally to the
Versification. We may observe of HONINGTON GREEN, and most of the Poems
in rhyme in this Collection, that they are strongly accentuated: and if
red with a close attention to accent and emphasis, the rhythm is musical
and energetic; where to a careless Reader it might appear harsh and
untuneable.
</p>

<p>
The LYRIC ELEGY which concludes this little Collection is, I think,
animated and pathetic in no common degree. On the Merits of VACCINE
INOCULATION I do not think myself qualify'd to offer an opinion. Great
Doubts have been entertain'd concerning it by <i>medical</i> Men of Abilities
and Experience. Objections apparently strong were urg'd; and of various
kinds. At present it has had Declarations in it's favor from among the
most distinguish'd of it's Opposers. And it seems to have little short
of a general reception in the <i>medical World</i>.... Time and Experience,
the great Test of Truth in such instances, must determine for or against
it. But, important as the Question is, poetical Merit is comparatively
independent on the correctness of a philosophic System or Hypothesis.
And reflecting on his former Losses and present Calamities, the Author
could not but feel a deep Interest in whatever seem'd likely to obviate
such an Evil to others.
</p>

<p>
I have observ'd some rather striking <i>coincidences</i> with VIRGIL and
LUCRETIUS. I might have pointed out more; and to other <i>classic</i>
Authors. But I should have extended this Preface too far. At the same
time, such a concurrence in the Sentiments and Expressions of Genius in
very distant Ages, and under widely different Circumstances, is always
interesting, even where it can be resolv'd with Certainty, or
Probability, into IMITATION: and much more so, when, as in these Poems,
it is certain that it CAN NOT.
</p>

<p>
I have very few Words more to say in presenting this little Volume to
the PUBLIC. Specimens they will find in it of such different kinds of
Composition, as the same individual rarely can attempt with success. Yet
through great diversity of Style, Dissimilarity of Measure, and Variety
of Sentiment and Subject, may be seen the same Mind: and Traces of the
same Manner, and that manner peculiarly characteristic...a mixture of
contemplative equanimity, of incidental gleams of vivacity; of energy
frequently pathetic, sometimes sarcastic, and not seldom sublime. And we
have here an additional proof, that a true poetic Spirit, in whatever
Breast it inhabits, will create Thoughts, Language, and Numbers, worthy
of the Muse, however unfavourable the occupation and habits of Life.
</p>

<p>
Mr. NATHANIEL BLOOMFIELD was not without his fears, however, lest it
should be thought, that, although THE MUSE can visit a SHEPHERD'S BOY,
there may be some employments which exclude her influence. That a TAYLOR
should be a POET, he doubted, might appear too startling an Assertion.
And he had said accordingly to his Brother GEORGE, in a Letter, when
this Publication was first going to Press, "I want you to exclude the
word <i>Taylor</i>. Let there be no such Word in the Book. But perhaps I am
too late. I know there is in the public Mind as great contempt for him
who bears the appellation of <i>Taylor</i>, as STERNE has made old SHANDY
have for SIMKIN, NECKEY, or TRISTRAM. How many CAESARS and POMPEYS, says
he, by mere inspiration of the names, have been rendered worthy of them?
And how many are there who might have done exceedingly well in the
World, had not their Characters and Spirits been totally depress'd and
<i>Nicodemiz'd</i>; and I will add (says Mr. N. BLOOMFIELD) <i>taylor'd</i> into
nothing? In the REHEARSAL, the Author, to make the most ridiculous
part of it still more ridiculous, tells us, that it was written to a
<i>Taylor</i>, and by a <i>Taylor's Wife</i>. And even the discerning SPECTATOR
has given into this common-place raillery in the Monkey's Letter to her
Mistress. He has made the Soul which inhabited Pug's Body, in recounting
the humiliating State it had formerly been in, say, that he had been a
<i>Taylor</i>, a Shrimp, and a Tom-tit. It is from these causes, as well as
from the habits and appearance contracted by a recluse and sedentary
Life, that, in the enlighten'd, as well as the ignorant, the ideas of
<i>Taylor</i> and <i>Insignificance</i> are inseparably link'd together."
</p>

<p>
I prevail'd, notwithstanding, that this word, whose <i>anti-poetic</i>
influence is so dreaded, should be in the Book. About half a Century
ago, there seem'd a degree of incredulity as to the possibility of
Courage in a <i>Taylor</i>. ELLIOT'S LIGHT HORSE, at that time compos'd of
<i>Taylor-Volunteers</i>. effectually overcame that prejudice. It remain'd
to dissolve another still more irrational prepossession, that a <i>Taylor
cannot be a Poet</i>. And this Volume will be a victorious Host against an
Army of such Prejudices. Indeed the Force is greater than such a Combat
requires: for stubborn as other Prejudices may still be, our litterary
Prejudices have, in this Age, been rapidly giving way to Candour,
Reason, Common-Sense, and the Evidence of Fact. We have long known that
a Scotch <i>Plough-Boy</i> and a <i>Milk-Woman</i><a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> could still be Poets of high
and almost singular Excellence. And if Improbability were any thing
against Fact, it would be far more improbable, that two Brothers should
be such Poets as ROBERT and NATHANIEL BLOOMFIELD are, than that a Taylor
should be a Poet. It remains then for Prejudice to vanish like Mists
before the Sun: while the two BROTHERS sociably ascend PARNASSUS
together; higher than ever Brothers have climbed before: I might add,
each of them to an height which but few have ever reach'd<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>.

I had said, and certainly upon full authority, 23rd April;
which the Author his-self believ'd to be the Day: and had remarked
accordingly it was a Day distinguish'd by the <i>Birth</i> and <i>Death</i>
of SHAKESPERE. But Mr. N. BLOOMFIELD discover'd and immediately
communicated the mistake as to the Day. Thus we lose an interesting
coincidence: but we gain what is of greater value; a just and prompt
sacrifice to truth and candor. C.L.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Man's sad necessity, destructive War,</p>
<p>Sweeps to the grave the surplus of his sons,</p>
<p>Where'er the kindly clime and soil invite</p>
<p>To Love; and multiply the Human Race.</p>
<p class="i2">  Around the World, in every happier spot</p>
<p>Where Earth spontaneous gives nutritious fruits.</p>
<p>Her softest verdure courting human feet,</p>
<p>And mossy grot's, beneath protecting shades,</p>
<p>The Stranger's envy, the Possessor's pride;</p>
<p>There, as increasing numbers throng each bower.</p>
<p>Frequent and fatal rivalships arise;</p>
<p>And ruthless War erects his hideous crest.</p>
<p class="i2">  Soon as Appropriation's iron hand</p>
<p>Assays to grasp the Produce of the Earth;</p>
<p>And youths assert hereditary power,</p>
<p>Propriety exclusive, and in arms</p>
<p>League to defend their patrimonial rights,</p>
<p>Indisputable claim of Fruits and Fields</p>
<p>Contending, oft their massive clubs they raise</p>
<p>Against each other's life: often, alas,</p>
<p>The needy cravings of the unportion'd poor</p>
<p>Provoke their jealous wrath; relentlessly</p>
<p>Tenacious of their store, they shut him out,</p>
<p>'Midst desart Famine, and ferocious Beasts,</p>
<p>To guard his life and till the steril soil;</p>
<p>And thus extend the range of human feet.</p>
<p class="i2">  Still as Experience, in her tardy school,</p>
<p>Instructs the Shepherd and the Husbandman</p>
<p>To great increase their flocks and herds to rear,</p>
<p>To till the ground, and plant the fruitful tree</p>
<p>In slow progression rising into use,</p>
<p>Nurtur'd by Her the infant Arts appear.</p>
<p>While sage Experience thus teaches Man</p>
<p>The useful and the pleasant Arts of Life,</p>
<p>She in harsh lectures, in the frequent broil,</p>
<p>Enjoins her Pupil still to cultivate</p>
<p>The fatal, necessary Art of War.</p>
<p class="i2">  The Artizan, who from metallic ores</p>
<p>Forms the sharp implements to dress the glebe,</p>
<p>And prune the wild luxuriance of the tree; ...</p>
<p>By him is made the sword, the spear, the shaft,</p>
<p>By Man worn to defend him against Man.</p>
<p class="i2">  Most bless'd the country where kind Nature's face</p>
<p>In unsophisticated Freedom smiles:</p>
<p>Happy the tenants of primeval days</p>
<p>When young society is in it's spring:</p>
<p>Where there is room and food for millions more,</p>
<p>Love knows no check, the votaries of Love,</p>
<p>The happy votaries of Wedded Love,</p>
<p>Know not the curse of peopled, polish'd, times:</p>
<p>The curse to wish their children may be few.</p>
<p class="i2">  Sweet converse binds the cords of social love;</p>
<p>When the rude noise and gestures that ere while</p>
<p>Imperfectly express'd the labouring thought;</p>
<p>By social concourse are improv'd to Speech:</p>
<p>Speech, reasoning Man's distinguishing perfection;</p>
<p>Speech, the inestimable vehicle</p>
<p>Of mental light, and intellectual bliss;</p>
<p>Whence the fair fruits of Holy Friendship grow,</p>
<p>Presenting to fond Hope's enamour'd sight</p>
<p>The fairy prospect of perpetual Peace.</p>
<p>Advanc'd Society's prudential Laws,</p>
<p>The moral virtues of the enlighten'd mind,</p>
<p>And all the ties of Interest and of Love,</p>
<p>In vain conspire to nurse their favourite Peace,</p>
<p>And banish dire Immanity and War.</p>
<p>Strong Nature's bent, continual increase,</p>
<p>Still counteracts Humanity's fond wish,</p>
<p>The perpetuity of Peace, and Love;</p>
<p>Alas! progressive Increase cannot last.</p>
<p>Soon mourns the encumber'd land it's human load:</p>
<p>Too soon arrives the inauspicious hour;</p>
<p>The Natal Hour of the unhappy Man,</p>
<p>Who all his life goes mourning up and down</p>
<p>That there is neither bough, nor mud, nor straw</p>
<p>That he may take to make himself a hut;</p>
<p>No, not in all his native land a twig</p>
<p>That he may take, nor spot of green grass turf,</p>
<p>Where without trespass he may set his foot.</p>
<p>Now Want and Poverty wage War with Love;</p>
<p>And hard the conflict: horrible the thought,</p>
<p>That Love, who boasts of his all-conquering impulse,</p>
<p>Should have to mourn abortive energies...</p>
<p>But in proportion as Mankind increase,</p>
<p>So evils multiply: till Nature's self,</p>
<p>(The native passions of the human mind)</p>
<p>Engender War; which thins, and segregates,</p>
<p>And rectifies the balance of the world:</p>
<p>As thick-sown plants in the vegetable world,</p>
<p>With stretching branches wage continual War;</p>
<p>Each tender bud shrinks from the foreign touch</p>
<p>With a degree of sensitive perception;</p>
<p>Till one deforms, o'er-tops, and kills the other.</p>
<p class="i2">  Like Summer swarms, that quit their native hives,</p>
<p>The offspring of increasing families,</p>
<p>Who find no room beneath their father's roofs,</p>
<p>No patrimony nor employ at home,</p>
<p>Colleagu'd in bands explore the desart wilds,</p>
<p>To seek adventures; or to seek their food:</p>
<p>If chance they meet with rovers (like themselves)</p>
<p>Whose home is far away in distant vales,</p>
<p>Behind the mountains, or beyond the lake;</p>
<p>Instinctively they war where'er they meet:</p>
<p>The friendly parley cannot intervene;</p>
<p>The unknown tongue does but create alarm:</p>
<p>With jealous fears, stern looks, and brandish'd arms,</p>
<p>They stand aloof: as birds of distant groves</p>
<p>At the strange note prepare for instant War.</p>
<p class="i2">  At first they skirmishing dispute the right</p>
<p>Of hunting in the unappropriate waste:</p>
<p>But every onset aggravates their hate;</p>
<p>Till each increasing force, whetting their swords,</p>
<p>With purpos'd malice seeking out the foe,</p>
<p>Alternate by reprisal and revenge,</p>
<p>Doubly compensate each discomfiture,</p>
<p>Yet seek not to attack each-other's home,</p>
<p>Where Age, and Infancy, in safety dwell:</p>
<p>They war but with freebooters: private Peace</p>
<p>And Female Covert, Valour scorns to assail.</p>
<p>But when in evil hour some female hand,</p>
<p>Whether by force of Love, or force of Arms,</p>
<p>Is led across the desart by the Foe;</p>
<p>The jealous fury kindles to a flame:</p>
<p>No longer sacred the domestic hearth:</p>
<p>Fire, Death, and Devastation, mark their way,</p>
<p>And all the horrid crimes of savage War.</p>
<p class="i2">  Now War becomes the business of the State:</p>
<p>The most humane, the most pacific men,</p>
<p>Must arm for War, or lose all they hold dear:</p>
<p>The sorrows of the Aged, Infant cries,</p>
<p>And Female Tears, resistlessly prevail:</p>
<p>Can gentlest natures be in love with Peace,</p>
<p>When Love, most tender Love, excites to War?</p>
<p>No.... When some lov'd and honour'd youth distrest'd,</p>
<p>Raising his head amongst his arm'd compeers,</p>
<p>Tells that the well-known honourable Maid,</p>
<p>The Virgin Mistress of his dearest hopes,</p>
<p>Is ravish'd from him, borne by force away;</p>
<p>Though pierc'd with grief, yet nobly he exclaims,</p>
<p>'Think not I wish to embroil you in my fate:</p>
<p>'For though not one of you espouse my cause,</p>
<p>'I singly will attempt the desperate deed.</p>
<p>'Farewell: I go to find my Love, or die!'</p>
<p class="i2">  Silent and motionless the legions stand,</p>
<p>By looks examining each-other's heart:</p>
<p>But soon a murmur through the ranks proceeds,</p>
<p>Swelling as quickly a terrific roar;</p>
<p>Like heavy waters breaking from their mounds,</p>
<p>A long, and loud, and inarticulate shout,</p>
<p>While every weapon vibrates in the air,</p>
<p>And hisses it's fierce vengeance at the foe.</p>
<p class="i2">  The righteous cause admits of no delay;</p>
<p>No tardy foot impedes the immediate march:</p>
<p>The Enemy, not taken by surprise,</p>
<p>Wak'd by the watchful fears of conscious guilt,</p>
<p>On their frontiers await the coming foe.</p>
<p class="i2">  Now at the near approach of threatening Death,</p>
<p>Full many a thinking, sighing, aching heart,</p>
<p>Indulges secretly the hopeless wish</p>
<p>For Life, and Peace.... Alas! it cannot be:</p>
<p>To advance is to encounter dreadful danger;</p>
<p>But to recede, inevitable death;</p>
<p>His own associates would deal the blow:</p>
<p class="i2">  Thus led by Fate, behold upon the plain,</p>
<p>The adverse bands in view, and in advance.</p>
<p>Now Fear, Self-pity, and affected Courage,</p>
<p>Speak in their hideous shouts with voice scarce human;</p>
<p>Like that which issues from his hollow throat</p>
<p>Who sleeping bellows in a frightful dream.</p>
<p>More near their glaring eye-balls flashing meet;</p>
<p>Terror and Rage distorting every face,</p>
<p>Inflame each-other into trembling fury.</p>
<p class="i2">  Soft-ey'd Humanity, oh! veil thy sight!</p>
<p>Tis not in Rationality to view</p>
<p>(Even in thought) the dire ensuing scene;</p>
<p>For Madness, Madness reigns, and urges men</p>
<p>To deeds that Rationality disowns.</p>
<p class="i2">  Now here and there about the horrid Field,</p>
<p>Striding across the dying and the dead,</p>
<p>Stalks up a man by strength superior,</p>
<p>Or skill and prowess in the arduous fight,</p>
<p>Preserv'd alive: ... fainting he looks around;</p>
<p>Fearing pursuit, nor caring to pursue.</p>
<p>The supplicating voice of bitterest moans,</p>
<p>Contortions of excruciating pain,</p>
<p>The shriek of torture and the groan of death,</p>
<p>Surround him; and as Night her mantle spreads,</p>
<p>To veil the horrors of the mourning Field,</p>
<p>With cautious step shaping his devious way,</p>
<p>He seeks a covert where to hide and rest:</p>
<p>At every leaf that rustles in the breeze</p>
<p>Starting, he grasps his sword; and every nerve</p>
<p>Is ready strain'd, for combat or for flight.</p>
<p class="i2">  Thus list'ning to ward off approaching foes,</p>
<p>A distant whispering, fighting, murmuring sound</p>
<p>Salutes his ear, and to his throbbing heart</p>
<p>Soft tidings tells of tenderness and love.</p>
<p>For on that fatal day of vengeful ire.</p>
<p>At fearful distance following the host,</p>
<p>From either country came a female throng;</p>
<p>And now beneath the covert of the night</p>
<p>Advancing, guided by the voice of woe,</p>
<p>Where on the earth the wounded mourners lay,</p>
<p>With trembling steps and fearful whispering voice,</p>
<p>Each seeks, and calls him whom she came to seek:</p>
<p>And many a fugitive, whom force or fear</p>
<p>Had driven from the Field, steals softly back,</p>
<p>Anxious to know the fate of some lov'd friend.</p>
<p>Mutual fears appal the mingled group,</p>
<p>Starting alternate at the unknown tongue:</p>
<p>They fear a foe in each uncertain form</p>
<p>That through the gloom imperfectly appears.</p>
<p>The mournful horrors of the doleful night</p>
<p>Melt every heart: ... and when the morning's beam</p>
<p>Shews the sad scene, and gives an interview,</p>
<p>Resentment, that worst torment of the mind,</p>
<p>Resentment ceases, satiate wrath subsides.</p>
<p>Woman is present: and so strong the charm</p>
<p>Of weeping Woman's fascinating tears,</p>
<p>That though surviving Heroes' unwash'd hands</p>
<p>Still grasp the falchion of horrid hue,</p>
<p>And though their fallen brethren from the ground</p>
<p>May seem to call for Vengeance from their hands,</p>
<p>The impulse of Revenge is felt no more;</p>
<p>No more the strange attire, the foreign tongue</p>
<p>Creates alarm: for Nature's-self has writ</p>
<p>In every face; where every eye can read</p>
<p>Repentant Sorrow, and forgiving Love.</p>
<p>Their mingled tears wash the lamented dead:</p>
<p>On every wound they pour soft Pity's balm:</p>
<p>Ere Sorrow's tears are dried, they feel the spring</p>
<p>Of new-born joys, and each expanding heart</p>
<p>Contemplates future scenes of Peace and Love.</p>
<p class="i2">  Long, even as long as room and food abound,</p>
<p>They interchange their friendly offices</p>
<p>For mutual good; reciprocally kind:</p>
<p>And much they wonder that they e'er were foes.</p>
<p>Still War's terrific name is kept alive:</p>
<p>Tradition, pointing to the rusty arms</p>
<p>That hang on high, informs each list'ning youth</p>
<p>How erst in fatal fields their Grandsires fell;</p>
<p>Childhood attentive hears the tragic tale;</p>
<p>And learns to shudder at the name of War.</p>
<p class="i2">  GUNPOWDER! let the Soldier's Pean rise,</p>
<p>Where e'er thy name or thundering voice is heard:</p>
<p>Let him who, fated to the needful trade,</p>
<p>Deals out the adventitious shafts of Death,</p>
<p>Rejoice in thee; and hail with loudest shouts</p>
<p>The auspicious era when deep-searching Art</p>
<p>From out the hidden things in Nature's store</p>
<p>Cull'd thy tremendous powers, and tutor'd Man</p>
<p>To chain the unruly element of Fire</p>
<p>At his controul, to wait his potent touch:</p>
<p>To urge his missile bolts of sudden Death,</p>
<p>And thunder terribly his vengeful wrath.</p>
<p>Thy mighty engines and gigantic towers</p>
<p>With frowning aspect awe the trembling World.</p>
<p>Destruction, bursting from thy sudden blaze</p>
<p>Hath taught the Birds to tremble at the sound;</p>
<p>And Man himself, thy terror's boasted lord,</p>
<p>Within the blacken'd hollow of thy tube,</p>
<p>Affrighted sees the darksome shades of Death.</p>
<p>Not only mourning groves, but human tears,</p>
<p>The weeping Widow's tears, the Orphan's cries,</p>
<p>Sadly deplore that e'er thy powers were known.</p>
<p>Yet let thy Advent be the Soldier's song,</p>
<p>No longer doom'd to grapple with the Foe</p>
<p>With Teeth and Nails&mdash;When close in view, and in</p>
<p>Each-other's grasp, to grin, and hack, and stab;</p>
<p>Then tug his horrid weapon from one breast</p>
<p>To hide it in another:&mdash;with clear hands</p>
<p>He now expertly poizing thy bright tube,</p>
<p>At distance kills, unknowing and unknown;</p>
<p>Sees not the wound he gives, nor hears the shriek</p>
<p>Of him whose breast he pierces.... GUNPOWDER!</p>
<p>(O! let Humanity rejoice) how much</p>
<p>The Soldier's fearful work is humaniz'd,</p>
<p>Since thy momentous birth&mdash;stupendous power.</p>
<p class="i2">  In Britain, where the hills and fertile plains,</p>
<p>Like her historic page, are overspread</p>
<p>With vestiges of War, the Shepherd Boy</p>
<p>Climbs the green hillock to survey his flock;</p>
<p>Then sweetly sleeps upon his favourite hill,</p>
<p>Not conscious that his bed's a Warrior's Tomb.</p>
<p class="i2">  The ancient Mansions, deeply moated round,</p>
<p>Where, in the iron Age of Chivalry,</p>
<p>Redoubted Barons wag'd their little Wars;</p>
<p>The strong Entrenchments and enormous Mounds,</p>
<p>Rais'd to oppose the fierce, perfidious Danes;</p>
<p>And still more ancient traces that remain</p>
<p>Of Dykes and Camps, from the far distant date</p>
<p>When minstrel Druids wak'd the soul of War,</p>
<p>And rous'd to arms old Albion's hardy sons,</p>
<p>To stem the tide of Roman Tyranny: ...</p>
<p>War's footsteps, thus imprinted on the ground,</p>
<p>Shew that in Britain he, from age to age,</p>
<p>Has rear'd his horrid head, and raging reign'd.</p>
<p class="i2">  Long on the margins of the silver Tweed</p>
<p>Opposing Ensigns wav'd; War's clarion</p>
<p>Dreadfully echo'd down the winding stream,</p>
<p>Where now sweet Peace and Unity reside:</p>
<p>The happy peasant of Tweed's smiling dale,</p>
<p>Whene'er his spade disturbs a Soldier's bones,</p>
<p>With shudd'ring horror ruminates on War;</p>
<p>Then deeper hides the awful spectacle,</p>
<p>Blessing the peaceful days in which he lives</p>
<p class="i2">  Since Peace has bless'd the villages on Tweed,</p>
<p>And War has ceas'd to drive his iron car</p>
<p>On Britain's shore, what myriads of men</p>
<p>Over the Eastern and the Western Seas</p>
<p>Have follow'd War, and found untimely graves.</p>
<p>Where'er the jarring interests of States</p>
<p>Excite the brave to' advance their native land</p>
<p>By deeds of arms, Britons are foremost found.</p>
<p>The sprightly bands, hast'ning from place to place,</p>
<p>Gayly carousing in their gay attire,</p>
<p>Invite, not force the train of heedless youths,</p>
<p>Who croud to share their jollity and joy:</p>
<p>To martial music dancing into death,</p>
<p>They fell their Freedom for a holiday;</p>
<p>And with the Rich and Great 'tis Glory charms,</p>
<p>And Beauty's favour that rewards the Brave.</p>
<p class="i2">  All the historic Records of the World</p>
<p>Are little more than histories of Wars;</p>
<p>Shewing how many thousands War destroy'd,</p>
<p>The time, the place, and some few great ones' names.</p>
<p>The mournful remnants of demolished States,</p>
<p>The Greek, the Roman, and long-exil'd Jew;</p>
<p>Are living monuments of wasting War's</p>
<p>Annihilating power: and while they mourn</p>
<p>Their Grandeur faded, and their Power extinct,</p>
<p>To every State <i>memento mori</i> sounds.</p>
<p>From age to age the habitable World</p>
<p>Has been a constant theatre of War:</p>
<p>In every land with Nature's gifts most blest,</p>
<p>Frequent and fatal Wars destructive rage.</p>
<p>So bland is fair Britannia's genial clime,</p>
<p>So liberal her all-protecting Laws,</p>
<p>So generous the spirit of her Sons,</p>
<p>So fond, so chaste, her Daughters virtuous love,</p>
<p>That human offspring still redundant grows,</p>
<p>And free-born Britons must contend for life.</p>
<p class="i2">  O! envy not the lands where Slaves reside,</p>
<p>Though their proud Tyrants boast of <i>peaceful</i> reign,</p>
<p>Where hard Oppression, freezing genial love,</p>
<p>Performs the work of War in embryo:</p>
<p>Let not mistaken fondness doat on Peace,</p>
<p>Preserv'd by arts more horrid far than War! ...</p>
<p>Let the dull languor of the pale Chinese</p>
<p>Desert their Infants, and their <i>Peace</i> enjoy!</p>
<p>But, O! let Britons still in Love and War</p>
<p>Exert the generous ardour of the soul;</p>
<p>Protect the Fair, and foster Infancy.</p>
<p class="i2">  By strenuous enterprize, and arduous toils,</p>
<p>Is public safety purchas'd and secur'd.</p>
<p>Negative merit, "I have done no harm,"</p>
<p>Is an inglorious boast: shall he who sits</p>
<p>Secure, enjoying Plenty in the lap</p>
<p>Of Ease, vaunt his recumbent Virtues? ... He</p>
<p>Brand with harsh epithets the Warrior's toils?</p>
<p>While 'tis to them he owes sincerest thanks</p>
<p>For Peace and Safety, that are earn'd in War....</p>
<p>As well might he who eats the flesh of Lambs,</p>
<p>And smacks the ichor in a savoury dish,</p>
<p>Boast his humanity, and say "My hand</p>
<p>Ne'er slew a Lamb;" and censure as a crime,</p>
<p>The Butcher's cruel, necessary trade.</p>
<p class="i2">  In Battle, the chance-medley game of Death,</p>
<p>Where every one still hopes 'till he expires,</p>
<p>Less horror shocks the mind contemplative,</p>
<p>Than where, in slow procession's solemn pace,</p>
<p>Doom'd wretches meet their destin'd fate in bonds,</p>
<p>Who know the moment to expect the blow,</p>
<p>And count the moments 'till that moment comes:</p>
<p>Or where Oppression wages War, in Peace,</p>
<p>On the defenceless: on the hapless man</p>
<p>Who holds his breath but by another's will:</p>
<p>Whose Life is only one long cruel Death! ...</p>
<p>Hardly he fares, and hopelessly he toils;</p>
<p>And when his driver's anger, or caprice,</p>
<p>Or wanton cruelty, inflicts a blow,</p>
<p>Not daring to look angry at the whip,</p>
<p>Oh! see him meekly clasp his hands and bow</p>
<p>To every stroke: no lurid deathful scene</p>
<p>In Battle's rage, so racks the feeling heart;</p>
<p>Not all the thunders of infuriate War,</p>
<p>Disploding mines, and crafting, bursting bombs,</p>
<p>Are half so horrid as the sounding lash</p>
<p>That echoes through the Carribean groves.</p>
<p class="i2">  Incessant is the War of Human Wit,</p>
<p>Oppos'd to bestial strength; and variously</p>
<p>Successful: in these happy fertile climes,</p>
<p>Man still maintains his surreptitious power;</p>
<p>Reigns o'er the Brutes, and, with the voice of Fate,</p>
<p>Says "This to-day, and that to-morrow dies."</p>
<p>Though here our Shambles blazon the Renown,</p>
<p>The Victory, and Rule, of lordly Man;</p>
<p>Far wider tracts within the Torrid Zone</p>
<p>Own no such Lord: where Sol's intenser rays</p>
<p>Create in bestial hearts more fervid fires,</p>
<p>And deadlier poisons arm the Serpent's tooth;</p>
<p>In gloomy shades, impassable to Man,</p>
<p>Where matted foliage exclude the Sun,</p>
<p>The torpid Birds that crawl from bough to bough</p>
<p>Utter their notes of terror: while beneath</p>
<p>Fury and Venom, couch'd in murky dens,</p>
<p>Hissing and yelling, guard the hideous gloom.</p>
<p>O'er dreary wastes, untrod by human feet,</p>
<p>Without controul the lordly Lion reigns;</p>
<p>And every creature trembles at his voice:</p>
<p>When risen from his den, he prances forth,</p>
<p>Extends his talons, shakes his flaky mane,</p>
<p>Then whurrs his tufted tail, and stooping low</p>
<p>His wide mouth near the ground, his dreadful roar</p>
<p>Makes all the desart tremble: he proclaims</p>
<p>His ire&mdash;proclaims his strong necessity;</p>
<p>And that surprise or artifice he scorns.</p>
<p class="i2">  Unskill'd, alas! in philosophic lore,</p>
<p>Unbless'd with scientific erudition;</p>
<p>How can I sing of elemental War,</p>
<p>Or the contending powers of opposite</p>
<p>Attractions, that impel, and poize, and guide,</p>
<p>The ever-rolling Spheres: Animal War,</p>
<p>The flux of Life, devouring and devour'd,</p>
<p>Ceaseless in every tribe, through Earth, and Air,</p>
<p>And Ocean, transcends my utmost ken.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">  From obvious truths my Song has aim'd to shew</p>
<p>That War is an inevitable Ill;</p>
<p>An Ill through Nature's various Realms diffus'd;</p>
<p>An Ill subservient to the General Good.</p>
<p class="i2">  With sympathetic sense of human woes</p>
<p>Deeply impress'd, the melancholy Muse</p>
<p>With modesty asserts this mournful Truth:</p>
<p>'Tis not in human wisdom to avert,</p>
<p>Though every feeling heart must sure lament,</p>
<p>The SAD NECESSITY of FATAL WAR.</p>

may be justifiable on circumstances: but in many if the fact is found,

           <p>  Once on a time, old Legends say,</p>
           <p>  'Twas on a sultry Summer's day,</p>
           <p>  A Grecian God forsook the Skies,</p>
           <p>  To taste of Earth's felicities.</p>
<p class="i2">    Clad like a rusticated elf,</p>

           <p>  And verdant lawns, by crystal floods;</p>
           <p>  For sure, said he, if Earth has joys,</p>
           <p>  They dwell remote from pomp and noise.</p>
<p class="i2">    He loitering pass'd the vacant hour,</p>
           <p>  For Strawberries stoop'd, or pluck'd a Flower,</p>
           <p>  And snuff'd the Zephyrs as they play'd,</p>
           <p>  In wanton curves beneath the shade.</p>

           <p>  He left the woods, he cross'd the plain,</p>
           <p>  And join'd the Reapers' jolly train;</p>

           <p>  Shedding intolerable blaze,</p>

The Poet has drawn his Jupiter according to the Homeric
Model, in it's least divine features. Yet I wish he had not. The
<i>Yorkshire Dip</i> (the mixture of sweet and sour) might have remained a
type of Life, temper'd in like manner: not by the wrath but by the
<i>benevolence</i> of Jupiter.

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>



<pre>
*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
