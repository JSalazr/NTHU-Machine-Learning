<p class="quote">
    'These "Links with the Past" are well worth reading, for not only do
    they introduce you to many agreeable personalities, but they illumine
    in unexpected quarters a past that is fast vanishing beyond the reach
    of personal recollections.'&mdash;<i>Morning Post</i>.
</p>
<p class="quote">
    'Few books of its kind that have lately appeared have been so
    entertaining and so full of interest as this, which, while it only
    professes to offer passing glimpses of bygone days, is a far more
    trustworthy and vivid record of social life during the greater part of
    the last century than many works of greater pretensions.'&mdash;<i>World</i>.
</p>
<p class="quote">
    'Mrs. Bagot has had all the advantages which a long life and the best
    society give to the memoir writer. Add to these an excellent memory,
    keen perceptions, and a decided gift of expression, and we have all
    the materials for a most pleasant <i>pot-pourri</i>.'&mdash;<i>Times</i>.

MEMORIALS OF
<br />
THE VERY REV. W.C. LAKE, D.D.,
</h2>
<p class="center">
DEAN OF DURHAM, 1869-1894.
</p>
<p class="center">
Edited by his Widow, KATHARINE LAKE.
</p>
<p class="center">
<i>One volume, 8vo., with Photogravure Portrait, 16s.</i>
</p>
<p>
At the time of his death in 1897, the late Dean of Durham was engaged
upon his Reminiscences, but they were unfortunately left in a very
fragmentary and incomplete condition. Mrs. Lake has, however, put the
MSS. in order, with the co-operation of Canon Rawlinson, of Canterbury,
and supplemented it with such additional materials as were in her
possession, including a selection from the Dean's full and varied
correspondence.
</p>
<p>
Dean Lake was a Fellow and Tutor of Balliol during the height of the
Oxford Movement, and was afterwards a member of the famous Royal
Commission on Education, which may be said to have laid the foundation
for all subsequent legislation on the subject. He was on intimate terms
with the leading men in the English Church during an eventful period of
its history, but, though a strong Churchman, he was a thorough man of
the world, of broad views and wide culture. Mrs. Lake has been permitted
to publish letters to her husband from his numerous friends, including
Arch-bishop Tait, Dean Church, Dean Stanley, Mr. Gladstone, Canon
Liddon, Dr. Pusey, Lord Halifax, and others&mdash;letters that not only add
considerably to our knowledge of those distinguished characters, but
contain many valuable comments upon large questions of permanent
interest.

This little life of St. Vincent de Paul does not aim at supplanting
larger biographies, but it contains enough to make the reader feel that
to know nothing of St. Vincent would be a serious loss to anyone who
desires a knowledge of the History of the Church and her advance towards
the solution of social problems.

This volume is uniform in design with the preceding, and will, it is

This work contains a detailed study of some of the great Romans whose
fame is eternal. Cæsar, Pompey, Sulla and the Gracchi were the men who
made Roman History, and their characters and actions are of living
interest to-day. Professor Oman's volume is based upon a series of
lectures given in Oxford, thoroughly revised for publication, and he

By BERNARD HOLLAND.
</h3>
<p class="center">
<i>One volume, octavo, 12s. 6d. net.</i>
</p>
<p class="quote">
'The book is one which it will be the desire, we may perhaps say the
necessity, of every student of the higher politics of the Empire to read
carefully. The development of the Empire ... and the character and
ideals of the collective organization as a whole, as these stand before
the world at the beginning of the twentieth century, are discussed by
Mr. Holland in a vein of modest conviction, and withal of illuminating
criticism, supported by apt quotation and example, which is very
instructive.'&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>.
</p>
<p class="quote">
'Mr. Bernard Holland has written a good book upon a great subject. He
writes with sobriety and force, backed by wide reading and considerable
knowledge of affairs. His book ought to be widely read and seriously
considered.'&mdash;<i>Times</i>.
</p>
<p class="quote">
'A very remarkable book; eminently instructive. The newest political
thought is addressed to the beginnings and the desirability of a
complete transformation of the British Empire. They are not all dreamers
and faddists who commend the change and would hasten it. Of such is Mr.
Bernard Holland, a man whose studies, whose sagacity, whose freedom from
the limitations of partizanship and the heats of controversy, entitle
him to a respectful hearing whenever he speaks.'&mdash;<i>Pall Mall

'We must congratulate Mr. Cook most warmly on his achievement. Whatever

ablest political journalist of the day. The writing is of a masterly
lucidity.'&mdash;<i>Literature</i>.

'We congratulate Mr. Peel most heartily on his frank and manly book.
That it will obtain a very large number of readers we do not doubt, for
it is a fascinating record of service in perhaps the most interesting
body of troops that took part in the war. In his book we get war as seen
from the ranks, recorded not only by a singularly able and cultivated
man, but by one who had plenty of experience of men and cities, and one
who had a first-hand acquaintance of generals and politicians before he
went campaigning.'&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>.

'This book seems to us to be perhaps the best contribution to the

This little volume is designed to give practical instruction in simple
cookery. It takes nothing for granted, and gives sensible notes and
rules for every phase of culinary work. The chief part of the book is
occupied with recipes suitable for ordinary English households under
economical management. It will be found equally useful in Schools of

    ESSEX HOUSE PRESS PUBLICATIONS.
</h2>
<p>
MR. EDWARD ARNOLD has much pleasure in calling attention to the fact
that almost without exception these interesting books have all been
bought up and become out of print before publication, while one or two
that have found their way into the sale-rooms have commanded a high
premium.
</p>
<p>
These books are printed at Essex House, on the presses used by the late
Mr. William Morris at the Kelmscott Press, which were purchased by the
Guild of Handicraft. Members of Mr. Morris's staff are also retained at
the Essex House Press, and it is the hope of the Guild of Handicraft by
this means to continue in some measure the tradition of good printing
and fine workmanship which William Morris revived.
</p>
<p>
Subscribers to the complete series of Essex House Publications are given
priority for any new book issued, and the number of subscribers is
constantly increasing.
</p>
<p>
Among the volumes expected to be published during the coming season are
the following:
</p>
<p class="quote">
  ERASMUS' <b>Praise of Folly</b>. SIR THOMAS CHALLONER'S Translation
  (Elizabethan). With a set of illustrations, borders, frontispiece, and
  initial by WILLIAM STRANG, and a cloth cover in motley by C.R. ASHBEE.
  250 copies. £3 3s.
</p>
<p class="quote">
  <b>The Psalms of David</b>. This book will be in the new type with a
  fresh set of historiated 'bloomers' designed by C.R. ASHBEE. 250 copies.
</p>
<p class="quote">
  <b>American Sheaves and English Seed Corn</b>. Essays and Addresses by
  C.R. ASHBEE.
</p>
<p class="quote">
  <b>The Essex House Song Book</b> will be issued in about 100 folio
  sheets, three or four songs coming on to the sheet of four pages. The
  sheets will be printed red and black in the new type, with wood-cut
  embellishments, and uniform in size with the Essex House 'Shakespeare.'
  Three hundred copies only will be issued, of which 100 are reserved in
  the first instance for America. The sheets will be published in batches
  of about ten sheets at a time, at a cost of 1s. a sheet, and over a
  period of two or three years. Subscriptions can only be received for the
  whole work, payable as the sheets are ready for delivery. Subscribers to
  the regular series of Essex House Press Publications will not be
  expected to subscribe if they do not wish to do so, but will be given
  first refusal.
</p>
<p>
<i>Intending subscribers and persons who desire to receive announcements
of the forthcoming publications are recommended to enter their names as
soon as possible</i>.

KING EDWARD THE SEVENTH'S PRAYER-BOOK.
</h2>
<p>
This will be a sumptuous edition of the Book of Common Prayer, which, by
gracious permission of His Majesty, will be entitled 'King Edward the
Seventh's Prayer-Book.'
</p>
<p>
The new Prayer-Book will be hand printed at the Essex House Press, and
whilst conforming to the Authorized Version will rank, as a piece of
typography, with the Great Prayer-Book of Edward VI. It is to be in new
type designed by Mr. C.R. Ashbee, with about one hundred and fifty
woodcuts, and is to be printed in red and black on Batchelor hand-made
paper. There will also probably be a special binding of green vellum
with a gold block design and clasps. The preparation of the work is
expected to occupy about eighteen months.
</p>
<p>
The Prayer-Book will be published by his Majesty's printers, Messrs.
Eyre and Spottiswoode, acting under the Royal Letters Patent, who will
superintend the work of the Essex House Press.
</p>
<p>
Exceptional circumstances connected with the Book of Common Prayer
render it essential that this work, in order to be of historic value,
shall be issued with the imprint of the King's printers; but Mr. EDWARD
ARNOLD has arranged to secure for subscribers to the Essex House Press
publications the first offer of copies, and orders should be sent in
before October 31, 1901, after which date such priority cannot be
guaranteed.
</p>
<p>
The edition will be strictly limited to a total of four hundred copies
for England and America, at a price of Twelve Guineas (£12 12s.) net,
and there will also be five copies on vellum at Forty Pounds (£40) net.

YALE BICENTENNIAL PUBLICATIONS.
</h2>
<p class="center">
DEDICATED TO THE GRADUATES OF YALE UNIVERSITY.
</p>
<p>
MR. EDWARD ARNOLD has pleasure in announcing the issue of an important
series of scientific works in connection with Messrs. Charles Scribner's
Sons, of New York.
</p>
<p>
With the approval of the President and Fellows of Yale University, the
series has been prepared by a number of the Professors and Instructors,
to be issued in connection with the Bicentennial Anniversary, as a
partial indication of the studies in which the University teachers are
engaged. The list of volumes includes some of a special and technical
nature, others of a more general character. Social Science, History,
Literature, Philology, Mathematics, Physical and Mechanical Science are
all represented, the object being to illustrate the special function of
the University in the discovery and orderly arrangement of knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Several of the volumes are now ready, and it is hoped that nearly all
will be published before the Bicentennial celebration in October.

    THE INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION SERIES.
</h2>
<p>
This splendid Series, issued under the general editorship of Dr. WILLIAM
T. HARRIS, United States Commissioner of Education, has now reached a
point when it may claim to provide a Complete Library for Teachers and
Students on all the main subjects connected with their Training and
Professional Work. Psychology, Philosophy, and History, so far as they
bear upon Education and Practical Methods of Teaching, are treated in a
number of interesting volumes by the highest authorities. Special
attention is drawn to the complete series of translations from Froebel,
and to those from Rousseau, Fouillée, Preyer, and Herbart, forming in
themselves a small library of the Classics of Education.
</p>

By the courtesy of the copyright owners, we are enabled this year for
the first time to include three works which have hitherto not been
obtainable in this Series in the British Empire.

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
