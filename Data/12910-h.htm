<a name="PREFACE"></a><h2>PREFACE</h2>
<br />

<p>A little book on a great subject, especially when
that book is one of a &quot;series,&quot; is notoriously an object
of literary distrust. For the limitations thus imposed
upon the writer are such as few men can satisfactorily
cope with, and he must needs ask the indulgence of
his readers for his painfully-felt shortcomings in dealing
with the mass of material which he has to manipulate.
And more especially is this the case when
the volume which immediately precedes his in the
series is such a mine of erudition as the 'Celtic
Britain' of Professor Rhys.</p>

<p>In the present work my object has been to give a
readable sketch of the historical growth and decay of
Roman influence in Britain, illustrated by the archaeology
of the period, rather than a mainly archaeological
treatise with a bare outline of the history. The chief
authorities of which I have made use are thus those
original classical sources for the early history of our
island, so carefully and ably collected in the 'Monumenta
Historica Britannica';<a name="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> which, along with
Huebner's 'Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum[2],' must
always be the foundation of every work on Roman
Britain. Amongst the many other authorities consulted
I must acknowledge my special debt to Mr.
Elton's 'Origins of English History'; and yet more
to Mr. Haverfield's invaluable publications in the
'Antiquary' and elsewhere, without which to keep
abreast of the incessant development of my subject
by the antiquarian spade-work now going on all over
the land would be an almost hopeless task.</p>

<a name="BIBLIOGRAPHY"></a><h2>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>
<br />

<p>A complete Bibliography of Roman Britain would
be wholly beyond the scope of the present work.
Much of the most valuable material, indeed, has never
been published in book form, and must be sought out
in the articles of the 'Antiquary,' 'Hermes,' etc., and
the reports of the many local Archaeological Societies.
All that is here attempted is to indicate some of the
more valuable of the many scores of sources to which
my pages are indebted.</p>

<p>To begin with the ancient authorities. These range
through upwards of a thousand years; from Herodotus
in the 5th century before Christ, to Gildas in the 6th
century after. From about 100 A.D. onwards we
find that almost every known classical authority
makes more or less mention of Britain. A list of
over a hundred such authors is given in the 'Monumenta
Historica Britannica'; and upwards of fifty
are quoted in this present work. Historians, poets,
geographers, naturalists, statesmen, ecclesiastics, all
give touches which help out our delineation of Roman
Britain.</p>

<p>Amongst the historians the most important are&mdash;Caesar,
who tells his own tale; Tacitus, to whom we
owe our main knowledge of the Conquest, with the
later stages of which he was contemporary; Dion
Cassius, who wrote his history in the next century,
the 2nd A.D.;<a name="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the various Imperial biographers
of the 3rd century; the Imperial panegyrists of
the 4th, along with Ammianus Marcellinus, who
towards the close of that century connects and supplements
their stories; Claudian, the poet-historian of
the 5th century, whose verses throw a lurid gleam on
his own disastrous age, when Roman authority in
Britain was at its last gasp; and finally the British
writers, Nennius and Gildas, whose &quot;monotonous
plaint&quot; shows that authority dead and gone, with the
first stirring of our new national life already quickening
amid the decay.</p>

<p>Of geographical and general information we gain
most from Strabo, in the Augustan age, who tells what
earlier and greater geographers than himself had
already discovered about our island; Pliny the
Elder, who, in the next century, found the ethnology
and botany of Britain so valuable for his
'Natural History'; Ptolemy, a generation later yet,
who includes an elaborate survey of our island in his
stupendous Atlas (as it would now be called) of the
world;<a name="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and the unknown compilers of the 'Itinerary,'
the 'Notitia,' and the 'Ravenna Geography.' To these
must be added the epigrammatist Martial, who lived
at the time of the Conquest, and whose references to
British matters throw a precious light on the social
connection between Britain and Rome which aids us
to trace something of the earliest dawn of Christianity
in our land.<a name="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p>The constant accession of new material, especially
from the unceasing spade-work always going on in
every quarter of the island, makes modern books on
Roman Britain tend to become obsolete, sometimes
with startling rapidity. But even when not quite up

<a name="A."></a><h4>SECTION A.</h4>

<p><i>Palaeolithic Age&mdash;Extinct fauna&mdash;River-bed men&mdash;Flint implements&mdash;Burnt stones&mdash;Worked<br /> bones&mdash;Glacial climate. </i></p>
<br />
<p>A. 1.&mdash;All history, as Professor Freeman so well
points out, centres round the great name of Rome.
For, of all the great divisions of the human race, it
is the Aryan family which has come to the front.
Assimilating, developing, and giving vastly wider
scope to the highest forms of thought and religion
originated by other families, notably the Semitic, the
various Aryan nationalities form, and have formed for
ages, the vanguard of civilization. These nationalities
are now practically co-extensive with Christendom;
and on them has been laid by Divine Providence
&quot;the white man's burden&quot;&mdash;the task of raising the
rest of mankind along with themselves to an ever
higher level&mdash;social, material, intellectual, and spiritual.</p>

<p>A. 2.&mdash;Aryan history is thus, for all practical purposes,
the history of mankind. And a mere glance at
<span class="newpage"><a name="page26" id="page26">[26]</a></span>
Aryan history shows how entirely its great central
feature is the period during which all the leading
forces of Aryanism were grouped and fused together
under the world-wide Empire of Rome. In that
Empire all the streams of our Ancient History find
their end, and from that Empire all those of Modern
History take their beginning. &quot;All roads,&quot; says the
proverb, &quot;lead to Rome;&quot; and this is emphatically
true of the lines of historical research; for as we tread
them we are conscious at every step of the <i>Romani
Nominis umbra</i>, the all-pervading influence of &quot;the
mighty name of Rome.&quot;</p>

<p>A. 3.&mdash;And above all is this true of the history of
Western Europe in general and of our own island in
particular. For Britain, History (meaning thereby
the more or less trustworthy record of political and
social development) does not even begin till its
destinies were drawn within the sphere of Roman
influence. It is with Julius Caesar, that great writer
(and yet greater maker) of History, that, for us, this
record commences.</p>

<p>A. 4.&mdash;But before dealing with &quot;Britain's tale&quot; as
connected with &quot;Caesar's fate,&quot; it will be well to note
briefly what earlier information ancient documents
and remains can afford us with regard to our island
and its inhabitants. With the earliest dwellers upon
its soil of whom traces remain we are, indeed, scarcely
concerned. For in the far-off days of the &quot;River-bed&quot;
men (five thousand or five hundred thousand years
ago, according as we accept the physicist's or the
geologist's estimate of the age of our planet) Britain
was not yet an island. Neither the Channel nor the
North Sea as yet cut it off from the Continent when
those primaeval savages herded beside the banks of its
streams, along with elephant and hippopotamus, bison
and elk, bear and hyaena; amid whose remains we
find their roughly-chipped flint axes and arrow-heads,
the fire-marked stones which they used in boiling their
water, and the sawn or broken bases of the antlers
which for some unknown purpose<a name="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> they were in the
habit of cutting up&mdash;perhaps, like the Lapps of to-day,
to anchor their sledges withal in the snow. For
the great Glacial Epoch, which had covered half the
Northern Hemisphere with its mighty ice-sheet, was
still, in their day, lingering on, and their environment
was probably that of Northern Siberia to-day. Some
archaeologists, indeed, hold that they are to this day
represented by the Esquimaux races; but this theory
cannot be considered in any way proved.</p>

<p>A. 5.&mdash;Whether, indeed, they were &quot;men&quot; at all, in
any real sense of the word, may well be questioned.
For of the many attempts which philosophers in all
ages have made to define the word &quot;man,&quot; the only
one which is truly defensible is that which differentiates
him from other animals, not by his physical or
intellectual, but by his spiritual superiority. Many
other creatures are as well adapted in bodily conformation
for their environment, and the lowest savages
are intellectually at a far lower level of development
than the highest insects; but none stand in the same
<span class="newpage"><a name="page27" id="page27">[27]</a></span>
relation to the Unseen. &quot;Man,&quot; as has been well
said, &quot;is the one animal that can pray.&quot; And there
is nothing amongst the remains of these &quot;river-bed
men&quot; to show us that they either did pray, or could.
Intelligence, such as is now found only in human
beings, they undoubtedly had. But whether they had
the capacity for Religion must be left an unsolved
problem. In this connection, however, it may be noted
that Tacitus, in describing the lowest savages of his
Germania [c. 46], &quot;with no horses, no homes, no
weapons, skin-clad, nesting on the bare ground, men
and women alike, barely kept alive by herbs and such
flesh as their bone-tipped arrows can win them,&quot;
makes it his climax that they are &quot;beneath the need
of prayer;&quot;&mdash;adding that this spiritual condition is,
&quot;beyond all others, that least attainable by man.&quot;</p>

<br />

<a name="B."></a><h4>SECTION B.</h4>

<p><i>Neolithic Age&mdash;&quot;Ugrians&quot;&mdash;Polished flints&mdash;Jadite&mdash;Gold ornaments&mdash;Cromlechs&mdash;Forts&mdash;Bronze<br />
Age&mdash;Copper and tin&mdash;Stonehenge.</i></p>
<br />
<p>B. 1.&mdash;Whatever they were, they vanish from our
ken utterly, these Palaeolithic savages, and are followed,
after what lapse of time we know not, by the users of
polished flint weapons, the tribes of the Neolithic
period. And with them we find ourselves in touch
with the existing development of our island. For an
island it already was, and with substantially the same
area and shores and physical features as we have them
still. Our rivers ran in the same valleys, our hills rose
<span class="newpage"><a name="page28" id="page28">[28]</a></span>
with the same contour, in those far-off days as now.
And while the place of flint in the armoury of Britain
was taken first by bronze and then by iron, these
changes were made by no sudden breaks, but so
gradually that it is impossible to say when one period
ended and the next began.</p>

<p>B.2.&mdash;It is almost certain, however, that the
Neolithic men were not of Aryan blood. They are
commonly spoken of by the name of <i>Ugrians</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> the
&quot;ogres&quot;<a name="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> of our folk-lore; which has also handed
down, in the spiteful Brownie of the wood and the
crafty Pixie of the cavern, dimly-remembered traditions
of their physical and mental characteristics. Indeed
it is not impossible that their blood may still be found
in the remoter corners of our land, whither they were
pushed back by the higher civilization of the Aryan
invaders, before whom they disappeared by a process
in which &quot;miscegenation&quot; may well have played no
small part. But disappear they did, leaving behind
them no more traces than their flint arrow-heads and
axes (a few of these being of jadite, which must have
come from China or thereabouts), together with their
oblong sepulchral barrows, from some of which the
earth has weathered away, so that the massive stones
imbedded in it as the last home of the deceased stand
exposed as a &quot;dolmen&quot; or &quot;cromlech.&quot; But an
appreciable number of the earthworks which stud our
<span class="newpage"><a name="page29" id="page29">[29]</a></span>
hill-tops, and are popularly called &quot;Roman&quot; or
&quot;British&quot; camps, really belong to this older race.
Such are &quot;Cony Castle&quot; in Dorset, and the fortifications
along the Axe in Devon.</p>

<p>B. 3.&mdash;During the neolithic stage of their development
the Ugrians were acquainted with but one metal,
gold, and some of their stone weapons and implements
are thus ornamented. For gold, being at once the
most beautiful, the most incorruptible, the most easily
recognizable, and the most easily worked of metals, is
everywhere found as used by man long before any
other. But before the Ugrian races vanish they had
learnt to use bronze, which shows them to have discovered
the properties not only of gold, but of both tin
and copper. All three metals were doubtless obtained
from the streams of the West. They had also become
proficients, as their sepulchral urns show, in the
manufacture of pottery. They could weave, moreover,
both linen and woollen being known, and had passed
far beyond the mere savage.</p>

<p>B. 4.&mdash;The race, indeed, which could erect Avebury
and Stonehenge, as we may safely say was done by
this people,<a name="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> must have possessed engineering skill of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page30" id="page30">[30]</a></span>
a very high order, and no little accuracy of astronomical
observation. For the mighty &quot;Sarsen&quot; stones have
all been brought from a distance,<a name="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> and the whole vast
circles are built on a definite astronomical plan; while
so careful is the orientation that, at the summer solstice,
the disc of the rising sun, as seen from the &quot;altar&quot;
of Stonehenge, appears to be poised exactly on the
summit of one of the chief megaliths (now known as
&quot;The Friar's Heel&quot;). From this it would seem that
the builders were Sun-worshippers; and amongst the
earliest reports of Britain current in the Greek world we
find the fame of the &quot;great round temple&quot; dedicated to
Apollo. But no Latin author mentions it; so that it
is doubtful whether it was ever used by the Aryan, or
at least by the Brythonic, immigrants. These brought
their own worship and their own civilization with
them, and all that was highest in Ugrian civilization
and worship faded before them, such Ugrians as remained
having degenerated to a far lower level when
first we meet with them in history.</p>

&mdash;Cassiterides&mdash;Phoenician tin trade vi&acirc; Cadiz.</i></p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page31" id="page31">[31]</a></span>
<br />
<p>C. 1.&mdash;How or when the first swarms of the Aryan
migration reached Britain is quite unknown.<a name="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> But they
undoubtedly belonged to the Celtic branch of that
family, and to the Gaelic (Gadhelic or Goidelic) section
of the branch, which still holds the Highlands of
Scotland and forms the bulk of the population of
Ireland. By the 4th century B.C. this section was
already beginning to be pressed northwards and
westwards by the kindred Britons (or Brythons) who
followed on their heels; for Aristotle (or a disciple
of his) knows our islands as &quot;the Britannic<a name="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Isles.&quot;
That the Britons were in his day but new comers may
be argued from the fact that he speaks of Great Britain
by the name of <i>Albion</i>, a Gaelic designation
subsequently driven northwards along with those who used
it. In its later form <i>Albyn</i> it long remained as loosely
equivalent to North Britain, and as <i>Albany</i> it still
survives in a like connection. Ireland Aristotle calls
<i>Ierne</i>, the later Ivernia or Hibernia; a word also
found in the Argonautic poems ascribed to the mythical
Orpheus, and composed probably by Onomacritus about
350 B.C., wherein the Argo is warned against approaching
&quot;the Iernian islands, the home of dark and noisome mischief.&quot;
This is the passage familiar to the readers of Kingsley's
'Heroes.'<a name="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page32" id="page32">[32]</a></span>
<p>C. 2.&mdash;Aristotle's work does no more than mention
our islands, as being, like Ceylon, not pelagic, but
oceanic. To early classical antiquity, it must be
remembered, the Ocean was no mere sea, but a vast and
mysterious river encircling the whole land surface of
the earth. Its mighty waves, its tides, its furious
currents, all made it an object of superstitious horror.
To embark upon it was the height of presumption;
and even so late as the time of Claudius we shall find
the Roman soldiers feeling that to do so, even for the
passage of the Channel, was &quot;to leave the habitable
world.&quot;</p>

<p>C. 3.&mdash;But while the ancients dreaded the Ocean,
they knew also that its islands alone were the source of
one of the most precious and rarest of their metals.
Before iron came into general use (and the difficulty of
smelting it has everywhere made it the last metal to
do so), tin had a value all its own. It was the only
known substance capable of making, along with copper,
an alloy hard enough for cutting purposes&mdash;the
&quot;bronze&quot; which has given its name to one entire Age
of human development. It was thus all but a necessary
of life, and was eagerly sought for as amongst
the choicest objects of traffic.</p>

<p>C. 4.&mdash;The Phoenicians, the merchant princes of
the dawn of history, succeeded, with true mercantile
instinct, in securing a monopoly of this trade, by being
the first to make their way to the only spots in the
world where tin is found native, the Malay region in
the East, Northern Spain and Cornwall in the West.
That tin was known amongst the Greeks by its Sanscrit
<span class="newpage"><a name="page33" id="page33">[33]</a></span>
name <i>Kastira</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> &#954;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#962; [<b>kassiteros</b>], shows that the Eastern
source was the earliest to be tapped. But the Western
was that whence the supply flowed throughout the
whole of the classical ages; and, as the stream-tin of
the Asturian mountains seems to have been early
exhausted, the name <i>Cassiterides</i>, the Tin Lands, came
to signify exclusively the western peninsula of Britain.
Herodotus, in the 5th century B.C., knew this name,
but, as he frankly confesses, nothing but the name.<a name="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
For the whereabouts of this El Dorado, and the
way to it, was a trade secret most carefully kept by
the Phoenician merchants of Cadiz, who alone held
the clue. So jealous were they of it that long afterwards,
when the alternative route through Gaul had already drawn
away much of its profitableness, we read of a Phoenician
captain purposely wrecking his ship lest a Roman vessel
in sight should follow to the port, and being indemnified
by the state for his loss.</p>

<p><i>Discoveries of Pytheas&mdash;Greek tin trade <i>vi&acirc;</i> Marseilles&mdash;Trade routes&mdash;Ingots&mdash;Coracles<br />
&mdash;Earliest British coins&mdash;Lead-mining.</i></p>
<br />
<p>D. 1.&mdash;But contemporary with Aristotle lived the
great geographer Pytheas; whose works, unfortunately,
we know only by the fragmentary references to them
<span class="newpage"><a name="page34" id="page34">[34]</a></span>
in later, and frequently hostile, authors, such as
Strabo, who dwell largely on his mistakes, and charge
him with misrepresentation. In fact, however, he
seems to have been both an accurate and truthful
observer, and a discoverer of the very first order.
Starting from his native city Massilia (Marseilles), he
passed through the Straits of Gibraltar and traced the
coast-line of Europe to Denmark (visiting Britain on his
way), and perhaps even on into the Baltic.<a name="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> The shore
of Norway (which he called, as the natives still call
it, Norg&eacute;) he followed till within the Arctic Circle, as
his mention of the midnight sun shows, and then struck
across to Scotland; returning, apparently by the Irish
Sea, to Bordeaux and so home overland. This truly
wonderful voyage he made at the public charge, with
a view to opening new trade routes, and it seems
to have thoroughly answered its purpose. Henceforward
the Phoenician monopoly was broken, and a
constant stream of traffic in the precious tin passed
between Britain and Marseilles.<a name="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p>D. 2.&mdash;The route was kept as secret as possible;
Polybius tells us that the Massiliots, when interrogated
by one of the Scipios, professed entire ignorance of
Britain; but Pytheas (as quoted by his contemporary
Timaeus, as well as by later writers) states that the metal
was brought by coasters to a tidal island, <i>Ictis</i>, whence
it was shipped for Gaul. This island was six days' sail
from the tin diggings, and can scarcely be any but
<span class="newpage"><a name="page35" id="page35">[35]</a></span>
Thanet. St. Michael's Mount, now the only tidal
island on the south coast, was anciently part of the
mainland; a fact testified to by the forest remains still
seen around it. Nor could it be six days' sail from
the tin mines. The Isle of Wight, again, to which
the name Ictis or Vectis would seem to point, can
never have been tidal at this date. But Thanet
undoubtedly was so in mediaeval times, and may
well have been so for ages, while its nearness to the
Continent would recommend it to the Gallic merchants.
Indeed Pytheas himself probably selected it
on this account for his new emporium.</p>

<p>D. 3.&mdash;In his day, as we have seen, the tin reached
this destination by sea; but in the time of the later
traveller Posidonius<a name="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> it came in wagons, probably
by that track along the North Downs now known as
the &quot;Pilgrims' Way.&quot; The chalk furnished a dry and
open road, much easier than the swamps and forests
of the lower ground. Further west the route seems
to have been <i>vi&acirc;</i> Launceston, Exeter, Honiton, Ilchester,
Salisbury, Winchester, and Alton; an ancient
track often traceable, and to be seen almost in its
original condition near &quot;Alfred's Tower,&quot; in Somerset,
where it is known as &quot;The Hardway.&quot; And this
long land transit argues a considerable degree of
political solidarity throughout the south of the island.
The tale of Posidonius is confirmed by Caesar's statement
<span class="newpage"><a name="page36" id="page36">[36]</a></span>
that tin reached Kent &quot;from the interior,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>
by land. It was obtained at first from the streams of
Dartmoor and Cornwall, where abundant traces of
ancient washings are visible, and afterwards by mining,
as now. And when smelted it was made up into
those peculiar ingots which still meet the eye in
Cornwall, and whose shape seems never to have
varied from the earliest times. Posidonius, who
visited Cornwall, compares them to knuckle-bones<a name="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>

<p>D. 4.&mdash;The vessels which thus coasted from the
Land's End to the South Foreland are described as on
the pattern of coracles, a very light frame-work covered
with hides. It seems almost incredible that sea-going
craft could have been thus constructed; yet not only
is there overwhelming testimony to the fact throughout
the whole history of Roman Britain, but such
boats are still in use on the wild rollers which beat
upon the west coast of Ireland, and are found able
to live in seas which would be fatal to anything more
rigidly built. For the surf boats in use at Madras a
similar principle is adopted, not a nail entering into
their construction. They can thus face breakers
which would crush an ordinary boat to pieces. This
method of ship-building was common all along the
northern coast of Europe for ages.<a name="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Nor were these
<span class="newpage"><a name="page37" id="page37">[37]</a></span>
coracles only used for coasting. As time went on,
the Britons boldly struck straight across from Cornwall
to the Continent, and both the Seine and the
Loire became inlets for tin into Gaul, thus lessening
the long land journey&mdash;not less than thirty days&mdash;which
was required, as Polybius tells us, to convey it
from the Straits of Dover to the Rhone. (This journey,
it may be noted, was made not in wagons, as through
Britain, but on pack-horses.)</p>

<p>D. 5.&mdash;Thus it reached Marseilles; and that the
trade was founded by the Massiliot Pytheas is borne
testimony to by the early British coins, which are
all modelled on the classical currency of his age.
The medium in universal circulation then, current
everywhere, like the English sovereign now, was the
Macedonian stater, newly introduced by Philip, a
gold coin weighing 133 grains, bearing on the one
side the laureated head of Apollo, on the other a
figure of Victory in a chariot. Of this all known
Gallic and British coins (before the Roman era) are
more or less accurate copies. The earliest as yet
found in Britain do not date, according to Sir John
Evans, our great authority on this subject,<a name="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> from
before the 2nd century B.C. They are all dished
coins, rudely struck, and rapidly growing ruder as
time goes on. The head early becomes a mere
congeries of dots and lines, but one horse of the
chariot team remains recognizable to quite the end of
the series.</p>

<p>D. 6.&mdash;These coins have been found in very large
<span class="newpage"><a name="page38" id="page38">[38]</a></span>
numbers, and of various types, according to the
locality in which they were struck. They occur as
far north as Edinburgh; but all seem to have been
issued by one or other of the tribes in the south and
east of the island, who learnt the idea of minting
from the Gauls. Whence the gold of which the coins
are made came from is a question not yet wholly
solved: surface gold was very probably still obtainable
at that date from the streams of Wales and Cornwall.
But it was long before any other metal was
used in the British mints. Not till after the invasion
of Julius Caesar do we find any coins of silver or
bronze issued, though he testifies to their existence.
The use of silver shows a marked advance in metallurgy,
and is probably connected with the simultaneous
development of the lead-mining in the Mendip Hills,
of which about this time we first begin to find traces.</p>

<br />
<p>E. 1.&mdash;The trustworthiness of Pytheas is further
confirmed by the astronomical observations which he
records. He notices, for example, that the longest
day in Britain contains &quot;nineteen equinoctial hours.&quot;
Amongst the ancients, it must be remembered, an
&quot;hour,&quot; in common parlance, signified merely the
twelfth part, on any given day, of the time between
<span class="newpage"><a name="page39" id="page39">[39]</a></span>
sunrise and sunset, and thus varied according to the
season. But the standard hour for astronomical
purposes was the twelfth part of the equinoctial
day, when the sun rises 6 a.m. and sets 6 p.m., and
therefore corresponded with our own. Now the longest
day at Greenwich is actually not quite seventeen
hours, but in the north of Britain it comes near
enough to the assertion of Pytheas to bear out his
tale. We are therefore justified in giving credence to
his account of what he saw in our country, the earliest
that we possess. He tells us that, in some parts at
least, the inhabitants were far from being mere savages.
They were corn-growers (wheat, barley, and millet
being amongst their crops), and also cultivated
&quot;roots,&quot; fruit trees, and other vegetables. What
specially struck him was that, &quot;for lack of clear
sunshine<a name="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>,&quot; they threshed out their corn, not in open
threshing-floors, as in Mediterranean lands, but in
barns.</p>

<p>E. 2.&mdash;From other sources we know that these old
British farmers were sufficiently scientific agriculturalists
to have invented <i>wheeled</i> ploughs,<a name="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> and to use a
variety of manures; various kinds of mast, loam, and
chalk in particular. This treatment of the soil was,
according to Pliny, a British invention<a name="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> (though the
Greeks of Megara had also tried it), and he thinks it
worth his while to give a long description of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page40" id="page40">[40]</a></span>
different clays in use and the methods of their application.
That most generally employed was chalk dug out from pits
some hundred feet in depth, narrow at the mouth, but
widening towards the bottom. [<i>Petitur ex alto, in
centenos pedes actis plerumque puteis, ore angustatis;
intus spatiante vena</i>.]</p>

<p>E. 3.&mdash;Here we have an exact picture of those
mysterious excavations some of which still survive to
puzzle antiquaries under the name of <i>Dene Holes</i>.
They are found in various localities; Kent, Surrey,
and Essex being the richest. In Hangman's Wood,
near Grays, in Essex, a small copse some four acres
in extent, there are no fewer than seventy-two Dene
Holes, as close together as possible, their entrance
shafts being not above twenty yards apart. These
shafts run vertically downwards, till the floor of the
pit is from eighty to a hundred feet below the surface
of the ground. At the bottom the shaft widens out
into a vaulted chamber some thirty feet across, from
which radiate four, five, or even six lateral crypts,
whose dimensions are usually about thirty feet in
length, by twelve in width and height. When the
shafts are closely clustered, the lateral crypts of
one will extend to within a few feet of those
belonging to its neighbours, but in no case do they
communicate with them (though the recent excavations
of archaeologists have thus connected whole groups of Dene
Holes). Many theories have been elaborated to account
for their existence, but the data are conclusive
against their having been either habitations, tombs,
store-rooms, or hiding-places; and, in 1898, Mr.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page41" id="page41">[41]</a></span>
Charles Dawson, F.S.A., pointed out that, in Sussex,
chalk and limestone are still quarried by means of
identically such pits. The chalk so procured is found
a far more efficacious dressing for the soil than that
which occurs on the surface, and moreover is more
cheaply got than by carting from even a mile's
distance. At the present day, as soon as a pit is
exhausted (that is as soon as the diggers dare make
their chambers no larger for fear of a downfall),
another is sunk hard by, and the first filled up with
the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> from the second. In the case of the
Dene Holes, this <i>d&eacute;bris</i> must have been required
for some other purpose; and to this fact alone we
owe their preservation. It is probable that the celebrated
cave at Royston in Hertfordshire was originally
dug for this purpose, though afterwards used as a
hermitage.</p>

<p>E. 4.&mdash;Pytheas is also our authority for saying that
bee-keeping was known to the Britons of his day;<a name="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> a
drink made of wheat and honey being one of their
intoxicants. This method of preparing mead (or
metheglin) is current to this day among our peasantry.
Another drink was made from barley, and this, he
tells us, they called &#954;&#959;&#957;&#961;&#956;&#953; [<b>kourmi</b>], the word still used in Erse
for beer, under the form <i>cuirm</i>. Dioscorides the

have tried our national beverage, as he lived shortly
after the Claudian conquest of Britain), pronounces it

<p>E. 5.&mdash;Not all the tribes of Britain, however, were
at this level of civilization. Threshing in barns was
only practised by those highest in development, the
true Britons of the south and east. The Gaelic tribes
beyond them, so far as they were agricultural at all,
stored the newly-plucked ears of corn in their underground
dwellings, day by day taking out and dressing
&#954;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962; [<b>katergazomenous</b>] what was needed for each meal. The
method here referred to is doubtless that described
as still in use at the end of the 17th century in
the Hebrides.<a name="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> &quot;A woman, sitting down, takes a
handful of corn, holding it by the stalks in her left
hand, and then sets fire to the ears, which are presently
in a flame. She has a stick in her right hand, which
she manages very dexterously, beating off the grains
at the very instant when the husk is quite burnt....
The corn may be thus dressed, winnowed, ground,
and baked, within an hour of reaping.&quot;</p>

<p>When kept, it may usually have been stored, like
that of Robinson Crusoe, in baskets;<a name="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> for
basket-making was a peculiarly British industry, and
Posidonius found &quot;British baskets&quot; in use on the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page43" id="page43">[43]</a></span>
Continent. But probably it was also hoarded&mdash;again
in Crusoe fashion&mdash;in the large jars of coarse pottery
which are occasionally found on British sites. These,
and the smaller British vessels, are sometimes elaborately
ornamented with devices of no small artistic
merit. But all are hand-made, the potter's wheel being
unknown in pre-Roman days.</p>

<p>E. 6.&mdash;Nor does the grinding of corn, even in hand-mills,
seem to have been universal till the Roman era,
the earlier British method being to bruise the grain
in a mortar.<a name="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> Without the resources of civilization
it is not easy to deal with stones hard enough for
satisfactory millstones. We find that the Romans,
when they came, mostly selected for this use the
Hertfordshire &quot;pudding-stone,&quot; a conglomerate of the
Eocene period crammed with rolled flint pebbles,
sometimes also bringing over Niederendig lava from
the Rhine valley, and burr-stone from the Paris basin
for their querns.</p>

<p>E. 7.&mdash;These tribes are described as living in cheap
&#949;&#8016;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#962; [<b>euteleis</b>], dwellings, constructed of reeds or logs, yet
spoken of as subterranean.<a name="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Light has been thrown
on this apparent contradiction by the excavation in
1889 of the site of a British village at Barrington in
Cambridgeshire. Within a space of about sixty yards
each way, bounded by a fosse some six feet wide and
four deep, were a collection of roughly circular pits,
distributed in no recognizable system, from twelve to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page44" id="page44">[44]</a></span>
twenty feet in diameter and from two to four in depth.
They were excavated in the chalky soil, and from each
a small drainage channel ran for a yard or two down
the gentle slope on which the settlement stood.
Obviously a superstructure of thatch and wattle would
convert these pits into quite passable wigwams,
corresponding to the description of Pytheas. This
whole village was covered by several feet of top-soil
in which were found numerous interments of Anglo-Saxon
date. It had seemingly perished by fire, a layer
of incinerated matter lying at the bottom of each pit.</p>

<p>E. 8.&mdash;The domestic cattle of the Britons were a
diminutive breed, smaller than the existing Alderney,
with abnormally developed foreheads (whence their
scientific name <i>Bos Longifrons</i>). Their remains, the
skulls especially, are found in every part of the land,
with no trace, in pre-Roman times, of any other breed.
The gigantic wild ox of the British forests (<i>Bos
Primigenius</i>) seems never to have been tamed by the
Celtic tribes, who, very possibly, like the Romans after
them, may have brought their own cattle with them
into the island. According to Professor Rolleston
the small size of the breed is due to the large
consumption of milk by the breeders. (He notes that
the cattle of Burmah and Hindostan are identically
the same stock, and that in Burmah, where comparatively
little milk is used, they are of large size. In
Hindostan, on the contrary, where milk forms the
staple food of the population, the whole breed is
stunted, no calf having, for ages, been allowed its due
supply of nutriment.) The Professor also holds that
<span class="newpage"><a name="page45" id="page45">[45]</a></span>
these small oxen, together with the goat, sheep, horse,
dog, and swine (of the Asiatic breed), were introduced
into Britain by the Ugrian races in the Neolithic Age;
and that the pre-Roman Britons had no domestic
fowls except geese.<a name="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p>E. 9.&mdash;If these considerations are of weight they
would point to an excessive dependence on milk even
amongst the agricultural tribes of Britain. And there
were others, as we know, who had not got beyond the
pastoral stage of human development. These, as
Strabo declares, had no idea of husbandry, &quot;nor even
sense enough to make cheese, though milk they have
in plenty.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> And some of the non-Aryan hordes
seem to have been mere brutal savages, practising
cannibalism and having wives in common. Both
practices are mentioned by the latest as well as the
earliest of our classical authorities. Jerome says that
in Gaul he himself saw Attacotti (the primitive inhabitants
of Galloway) devouring human flesh, and refers
to their sexual relations, which more probably imply
some system of polyandry, such as still prevails in
Thibet, than mere promiscuous intercourse. Traces
of this system long remained in the rule of &quot;Mutter-recht,&quot;
which amongst several of the more remote septs
traced inheritance invariably through the mother and
not the father.</p>

<p>E. 10.&mdash;These savages knew neither corn nor cattle.
Like the &quot;Children of the Mist&quot; in the pages of
Walter Scott,<a name="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> their boast was &quot;to own no lord, receive
<span class="newpage"><a name="page46" id="page46">[46]</a></span>
no land, take no hire, give no stipend, build no hut,
enclose no pasture, sow no grain; to take the deer
of the forest for their flocks and herds,&quot; and to eke
out this source of supply by preying upon their less
barbarous neighbours &quot;who value flocks and herds
above honour and freedom.&quot; Lack of game, however,
can seldom have driven them to this; for the forests
of ancient Britain seem to have swarmed with animal
life. Red deer, roebuck, wild oxen, and wild swine
were in every brake, beaver and waterfowl in every
stream; while wolf, bear, and wild-cat shared with man
in taking toll of their lives. The trees of these forests,
it may be mentioned, were (as in some portions of
Epping Forest now) almost wholly oak, ash, holly,
and yew; the beech, chestnut, elm, and even the
fir, being probably introduced in later ages.</p>

<p>E. 11.&mdash;Of the British tribes, however, almost none,
even amongst these wild woodlanders, were the naked
savages, clothed only in blue paint, that they are
commonly imagined to have been. On the contrary, they
could both weave and spin; and the tartan, with its
variegated colours, is described by Caesar's contemporary,
Diodorus Siculus, as their distinctive dress,
just as one might speak of Highlanders at the present
day.<a name="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> Pliny mentions that all the colours used were
<span class="newpage"><a name="page47" id="page47">[47]</a></span>
obtained from native herbs and lichens,<a name="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> as is still the
case in the Hebrides, where sea-weed dyes are mostly
used. Woad was used for tattooing the flesh with blue
patterns, and a decoction of beechen ashes for dyeing
the hair red if necessary, whenever that colour was
fashionable.<a name="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> The upper classes wore collars and
bracelets of gold, and necklaces of glass and amber
beads.</p>

<p>E. 12.&mdash;This last item suggests an interesting question
as to whence came the vast quantities of amber
thus used. None is now found upon our shores,
except a very occasional fragment on the East
Anglian beaches. But the British barrows bear abundant
testimony to its having been in prehistoric times
the commonest of all materials for ornamental
purposes&mdash;far commoner than in any other country.
Beads are found by the myriad&mdash;a single Wiltshire
grave furnished a thousand&mdash;mostly of a discoid
shape, and about an inch in diameter. Larger plates
occasionally appear, and in one case (in Sussex) a cup
formed from a solid block of exceptional size. If all
this came from the Baltic, the main existing source of
our amber,<a name="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> it argues a considerable trade, of which
<span class="newpage"><a name="page48" id="page48">[48]</a></span>
we find no mention in any extant authority. Pytheas
witnesses to the amber of the Baltic, and says nothing,
so far as we know, of British amber. But, according
to Pliny,<a name="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> his contemporary Solinus speaks of it as a
British product; and at the Christian era it was apparently
a British export.<a name="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> The supply of amber as a
jetsom is easily exhausted in any given district; miles
of Baltic coast rich in it within mediaeval times are
now quite barren; and the same thing has probably
taken place in Britain. The rapid wearing away of
our amber-bearing Norfolk shore is not unlikely to
have been the cause of this change; the submarine
fir-groves of the ancient littoral, with their resinous
exudations, having become silted over far out at sea.<a name="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
The old British amber sometimes contained flies.
Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> applies to it the epithet &#960;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#965;&#947;&#959;&#966;&#8057;&#961;&#959;&#957; [<b>pterugophoron</b>]
[&quot;fly-bearing&quot;].</p>

<p>E. 13.&mdash;The chiefs were armed with large brightly-painted
shields,<a name="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> plumed (and sometimes crested) helmets,
and cuirasses of leather, bronze, or chain-mail.
The national weapons of offence were darts, pikes
(sometimes with prongs&mdash;the origin of Britannia's
trident), and broadswords; bows and arrows being
more rarely used. Both Diodorus Siculus [v. 30] and
Strabo [iv. 197] describe this equipment, and specimens
of all the articles have, at one place or another,
been found in British interments.<a name="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> The arms are
<span class="newpage"><a name="page49" id="page49">[49]</a></span>
often richly worked and ornamented, sometimes inlaid
with enamel, sometimes decorated with studs of red
coral from the Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> The shields, being of
wood, have perished, but their circular bosses of iron
still remain. The chariots, which formed so special
a feature of British militarism, were also of wood,
painted, like the shields, and occasionally ironclad.<a name="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
The iron may have been from the Sussex fields. We
know that in Caesar's day rings of this metal were one
of the forms of British currency, so that before his
time the Britons must have attained to the smelting
of this most intractable of metals.</p>

<br />
<p>F. 1.&mdash;Our earliest records point to the existence
among the Celtic tribes in Britain of the two physical
types still to be found amongst them; the tall,
fair, red-haired, blue-eyed Gael, whom his clansmen
denominate &quot;Roy&quot; (the Red), and the dark complexion,
hair and eyes, usually associated with shorter stature,
which go with the designation &quot;Dhu&quot; (the Black).
Rob Roy and Roderick Dhu are familiar illustrations
of this nomenclature. In classical times these types
were much less intermingled than now, and were
characteristic of separate races. The former prevailed
<span class="newpage"><a name="page50" id="page50">[50]</a></span>
almost exclusively amongst the true Britons of the
south and east, and the Gaelic septs of the north,
while the latter was found throughout the west, in
Devon, Cornwall, and Wales. The Silurians, of Glamorgan,
are specially noted as examples of this &quot;black&quot;
physique, and a connection has been imagined between
them and the Basques of Iberia, an idea originating
with Strabo.</p>

<p>F. 2.&mdash;That a good deal of non-Aryan blood was,
and is, to be found in both regions is fairly certain;
but any closer correlation must be held at any rate not
proven. For though Strabo asserts that the Silurians
differ not only in looks but in language from the
Britons, while in both resembling the Iberians, it is
probable that he derives his information from Pytheas
four centuries earlier. At that date non-Aryan speech
may very possibly still have lingered on in the West,
but there is no trace whatever to be found of anything
of the sort in the nomenclature of the district during
or since the Roman occupation. All is unmitigated
Celtic. We may, however, possibly find a confirmation
of Strabo's view in the word <i>Logris</i> applied to
Southern Britain by the Celtic bards of the Arturian
cycle. The word is said to be akin to <i>Liger</i> (Loire),
and tradition traced the origin of the Loegrians to the
southern banks of that river, which were undoubtedly
held by Iberian (Basque) peoples at least to the date
when Pytheas visited those parts. The name, indeed,
seems to be connected with that of the Ligurians, a
kindred non-Aryan community, surviving, in historical
times, only amongst the Maritime Alps.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page51" id="page51">[51]</a></span>
<p>F. 3.&mdash;It is probable that the status of each clan
was continually shifting; and what little we know of
their names and locations, their rise and their fall,
presents an even more kaleidoscopic phantasmagoria
than the mediaeval history of the Scotch Highlands,
or the principalities of Wales, or the ever-changing
septs of ancient Ireland. Tribes absorbed or destroyed
by conquering tribes, tribes confederating with others
under a fresh name, this or that chief becoming a
new eponymous hero,&mdash;such is the ceaseless spectacle
of unrest of which the history of ancient Britain gives
us glimpses.</p>

<p>F. 4.&mdash;By the time that these glimpses become anything
like continuous, things were further complicated
by two additional elements of disturbance. One of
these was the continuous influx of new settlers from
Gaul, which was going on throughout the 1st century
B.C. Caesar tells us that the tribes of Kent, Sussex, and
Essex were all of the Belgic stock, and we shall see
that the higher politics of his day were much influenced
by the fact that one and the same tribal chief claimed
territorial rights in Gaul and Britain at once; just
like so many of our mediaeval barons. The other
was the coincidence that just at this period the
British tribes began to be affected by the turbulent
stage of constitutional development connected, in
Greece and Rome, with the abolition of royalty.</p>

<p>F. 5.&mdash;The primitive Aryan community (so far, at
least, as the western branch of the race is concerned)
everywhere presents to us the threefold element of
King, Lords, and Commons. The King is supreme,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page52" id="page52">[52]</a></span>
he reigns by right of birth (though not according to
strict primogeniture), and he not only reigns but
governs. Theoretically he is absolute, but practically
can do little without taking counsel with his Lords,
the aristocracy of the tribe, originally an aristocracy
of birth, but constantly tending to become one of
wealth. The Commons gather to ratify the decrees
of their betters, with a theoretical right to dissent
(though not to discuss), a right which they seldom or
never at once care and dare to exercise.</p>

<p>F. 6.&mdash;In course of time we see that everywhere
the supremacy of the Kings became more and more
distasteful to the Aristocracy, and was everywhere
set aside, sometimes by a process of quiet depletion
of the Royal prerogative, sometimes by a revolution;
the change being, in the former case, often informal,
with the name, and sometimes even the succession,
of the eviscerated office still lingering on. The executive
then passed to the Lords, and the state became
an oligarchical Republic, such as we see in Rome
after the expulsion of the Tarquins. Next came the
rise of the Lower Orders, who insisted with ever-increasing
urgency on claiming a share in the direction
of politics, and in every case with ultimate success.
Almost invariably the leaders who headed this uprising
of the masses grasped for themselves in the end
the supreme power, and as irresponsible &quot;Dictators,&quot;
&quot;Tyrants,&quot; or &quot;Emperors&quot; took the place of the old
constitutional Kings.</p>

<p>F. 7.&mdash;Such was the cycle of events both in Rome
and in the Greek commonwealths; though in the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page53" id="page53">[53]</a></span>
latter it ran its course within a few generations, whilst
amongst the law-abiding Romans it was a matter of
centuries. And the pages of Caesar bear abundant
testimony to the fact that in his day the Gallic tribes
were all in the state of turmoil which mostly attended
the &quot;<i>Regifugium</i>&quot; period of development. Some
were still under their old Kings; some, like the Nervii,
had developed a Senatorial government; in some the
Commons had set up &quot;Tyrants&quot; of their own. It
was this general unrest which contributed in no small
degree to the Roman conquest of Gaul. And the
same state of things seems to have been begun in
Britain also. The earliest inscribed British coins
bear, some of them the names of Kings and Princes,
others those of peoples, others again designations
which seem to point to Tyrants. To the first class
belong those of Commius, Tincommius, Tasciovan,
Cunobelin, etc.; to the second those of the Iceni
and the Cassi; to the last the northern mintage of
Volisius, a potentate of the Parisii, who calls himself
Domnoverus, which, according to Professor Rhys,<a name="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
literally signifies &quot;Demagogue.&quot;</p>

<br />
<p>G. 1.&mdash;The earliest of these inscribed coins, however,
take us no further back than the Julian invasion;
<span class="newpage"><a name="page54" id="page54">[54]</a></span>
and it is to Caesar's Commentaries that we are indebted
for the first recorded names of any British tribes. It
is no part of his design to give any regular list of the
clans or their territories; he merely makes incidental
mention of such as he had to do with. Thus we
learn of the four nameless clans who occupied Kent
(a region which has kept its territorial name unchanged
from the days of Pytheas), and also of the
Atrebates, Cateuchlani, Trinobantes, Cenimagni,
Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci, and Cassi.</p>

<p>G. 2.&mdash;To the localities held by these tribes Caesar
bears no direct evidence; but from his narrative, as
well as from local remains and later references, we
know that the Trinobantes possessed Essex, and the
Cenimagni (i.e. &quot;the Great Iceni&quot; as they were still
called,<a name="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> though their power was on the wane), East
Anglia; while the Cateuchlani, already beginning to
be known as the Cassivellauni (or Cattivellauni),
presumably from their heroic chieftain Caswallon (or
Cadwallon),<a name="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> corresponded roughly to the later South
Mercians, between the Thames and the Nene. The
Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci, and Cassi were less
considerable, and must evidently have been situated
on the marches between their larger neighbours. The
name of the Cassi may still, perhaps, cling to their
<span class="newpage"><a name="page55" id="page55">[55]</a></span>
old home, in the <i>Cashio</i> Hundred and <i>Cassiobury</i>,
near Watford; while conjecture finds traces of the
Ancalites in <i>Henley</i>, and of the Bibroci in <i>Bray</i>, on
either side of the Thames.</p>

<p>G. 3.&mdash;The Atrebates, who play a not unimportant
part (as will be seen in the next chapter) in Caesar's
connection with Britain, were apparently in possession
of the whole southern bank of the Thames, from its
source right down to London&mdash;the river then, as in
Anglo-Saxon times, being a tribal boundary throughout
its entire length. This would make the Bibroci a
sub-tribe of the Atrebatian Name, and also the
Segontiaci, if Henry of Huntingdon (writing in the
12th century with access to various sources of information
now lost) is right in identifying Silchester,
the Roman <i>Calleva</i>, with their local stronghold Caer
Segent.</p>

<p>G. 4.&mdash;But the whole attempt to locate accurately any
but the chiefest tribes found by the Romans in Britain
is too conjectural to be worth the infinite labour that
has been expended upon the subject by antiquaries.
All we can say with certainty is that forest and fen
must have cut up the land into a limited number of
fairly recognizable districts, each so far naturally
separated from the rest as to have been probably a
separate or quasi-separate political entity also. Thus,
not only was the Thames a line of demarcation, only
passable at a few points, from its estuary nearly to the
Severn Sea, but the southern regions cut off by it were
parted by Nature into five main districts. Sussex was
hemmed in by the great forest of Anderida, and that
<span class="newpage"><a name="page56" id="page56">[56]</a></span>
of Selwood continued the line from Southampton to
Bristol. Kent was isolated by the Romney marshes
and the wild country about Tunbridge, while the
western peninsula was a peninsula indeed when the
sea ran up to beyond Glastonbury. In this region,
then, the later Wessex, we find five main tribes; the
men of Kent, the Regni south of the Weald, the
Atrebates along the Thames, the Belgae on the
Wiltshire Avon, and the Damnonii of Devon and
Cornwall, with (perhaps) a sub-tribe of their Name,
the Durotriges, in Dorsetshire.</p>

<p>G. 5.&mdash;Like the south, the eastern, western, and
northern districts of England were cut off from the
centre by natural barriers. The Fens of Cambridgeshire
and the marshes of the Lea valley, together with
the dense forest along the &quot;East Anglian&quot; range,
enclosed the east in a ring fence; within which yet
another belt of woodland divided the Trinobantes of
Essex from the Iceni of Norfolk and Suffolk. The
Severn and the Dee isolated what is now Wales, a
region falling naturally into two sub-divisions; South
Wales being held by the Silurians and their Demetian
subjects, North Wales by the Ordovices. The lands
north of the Humber, again, were barred off from the
south by barriers stretching from sea to sea; the
Humber itself on the one hand, the Mersey estuary
on the other, thrusting up marshes to the very foot of
the wild Pennine moorlands between. And the whole
of this vast region seems to have been under the
Brigantes, who held the great plain of York, and
exercised more or less of a hegemony over the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page57" id="page57">[57]</a></span>
Parisians of the East Riding, the Segontii of
Lancashire, and the Otadini, Damnonii, and Selgovae
between the Tyne and the Forth. Finally, the Midlands,
parcelled up by the forests of Sherwood, Needwood,
Charnwood, and Arden, into quarters, found
space for the Dobuni in the Severn valley (to the
west of the Cateuchlani), for the Coritani east of the
Trent, and for their westward neighbours the Cornavii.<a name="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p>G. 6.&mdash;All these tribes are given in Ptolemy's
geography, but only a few, such as the Iceni, the
Silurians, and the Brigantes, meet us in actual history;
whilst, of them all, the Damnonian name alone reappears
after the fall of the Roman dominion. Thus
the accepted allotment of tribal territory is largely conjectural.
North of the Forth all is conjecture pure and
simple, so far as the location of the various Caledonian
sub-clans is concerned. We only know that there
were about a dozen of them; the Cornavii, Carini,
Carnonacae, Cerones, Decantae, Epidii, Horestae, Lugi,
Novantae, Smertae, Taexali, Vacomagi, and Vernicomes.
Some of these may be alternative names.</p>

<p>G. 7.&mdash;The practical importance of the above-mentioned
natural divisions of the island is testified
to by the abiding character of the corresponding
political divisions. The resemblance which at once
strikes the eye between the map of Roman and Saxon
Britain is no mere coincidence. Physical considerations
<span class="newpage"><a name="page58" id="page58">[58]</a></span>
brought about the boundaries between the Roman
&quot;provinces&quot; and the Anglo-Saxon principalities
alike. Thus a glance will show that Britannia Prima,
Britannia Secunda, Maxima Caesariensis, and Flavia
Caesariensis correspond to the later Wessex, Wales,
Northumbria, and Mercia (with its dependency East
Anglia).<a name="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> And even the sub-divisions remained approximately
the same. In Anglo-Saxon times, for example,
the Midlands were still divided into the same four tribal
territories; the North Mercians holding that of the
British Cornavii, the South Mercians that of the
Dobuni, the Middle Angles that of the Coritani, and
the South Angles that of the Cateuchlani. So also
the Icenian kingdom, with its old boundaries, became
that of the East Angles, and the Trinobantian that of
the East Saxons.</p>

<p>G. 8.&mdash;What the entire population of Britain may
have numbered at the Roman Conquest is, again,
purely a matter of guess-work. But it may well have
been not very different in amount from what it was at
the Norman Conquest, when the entries in Domesday
roughly show that the whole of England (south of the
Humber) was inhabited about as thickly as the Lake
District at the present day, and contained some two
million souls. The primary hills, and the secondary
plateaux, where now we find the richest corn lands of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page59" id="page59">[59]</a></span>
the whole country, were in pre-Roman times covered
with virgin forest. But in the river valleys above the
level of the floods were to be found stretches of good
open plough land, and the chalk downs supplied
excellent grazing. Where both were combined, as in
the valleys of the Avon and Wily near Salisbury, and
that of the Frome near Dorchester, we have the ideal
site for a Celtic settlement. In such places we
accordingly find the most conspicuous traces of the
prehistoric Briton; the round barrows which mark
the burial-places of his chiefs, and the vast earthworks
with which he crowned the most defensible <i>dun</i>, or
height, in his territory.</p>

<p>G. 9.&mdash;These fortified British <i>duns</i> are to be seen all
over England. Sometimes they have become Roman
or mediaeval towns, as at Old Sarum; sometimes they
are still centres of population, as at London, Lincoln,
and Exeter; and sometimes, as at Bath and Dorchester,
they remain still as left by their original
constructors. For they were designed to be usually
untenanted; not places to dwell in, but camps of
refuge, whither the neighbouring farmers and their
cattle might flee when in danger from a hostile raid.
The lack of water in many of them shows that they
could never have been permanently occupied either
in war or peace.<a name="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> Perhaps the best remaining
<span class="newpage"><a name="page60" id="page60">[60]</a></span>
example is Maiden<a name="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> Castle, which dominates Dorchester,
being at once the largest and the most untouched
by later ages. Here three huge concentric
ramparts, nearly three miles in circuit, gird in a space
of about fifty acres on a gentle swell of the chalk
ridge above the modern town by the river. A single
tortuous entrance, defended by an outwork, gives
access to the levelled interior. All, save the oaken
palisades which once topped each round of the
barrier, remains as it was when first constructed,
looking down, now as then, on the spot where the
population for whose benefit it was made dwelt in
time of peace. For English Dorchester is the British
town whose name the Romans, when they raised the
square ramparts which still encircle it, transliterated
into Durnovaria. Durnovaria in turn became, on
Anglo-Saxon lips, Dornwara-ceaster, Dorn-ceaster,
and finally Dorchester.</p>

<p>G. 10.&mdash;We have already, on physical grounds,
assigned these Durotriges to the Damnonian Name.
There were certainly fewer natural obstacles between
them and the men of Devon to the west than between
them and the Belgae to the northward. Caesar, however,
distinctly states that the Belgic power extended
to the coast line, so the Britons of the Frome valley
may have been conquered by them. Or the Durotriges
may be a Belgic tribe after all. For, as we
have pointed out, our evidence is of the scantiest, and
there is every reason to suppose that the era of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page61" id="page61">[61]</a></span>
Roman invasion was one of incessant political confusion
in the land.</p>

<br />

<p>H. 1.&mdash;The religious state of the country seems to
have been in no less confusion than its political condition.
The surviving &quot;Ugrian&quot; inhabitants appear to
have sunk into mere totemists and fetish worshippers,
like the aboriginal races of India; while the Celtic
tribes were at a loose and early stage of polytheism,
with a Pantheon filled by every possible device, by
the adoration of every kind of natural phenomenon,
the sky, the sun, the moon, the stars, the winds and
clouds, the earth and sea, rivers, wells, sacred trees,
by the creation of tribal divinities, gods and goddesses
of war, commerce, healing, and all the congeries of
mutually tolerant devotions which we see in the
Brahmanism of to-day. And, as in Brahmanism, all
these devotions were under the shadow of a sacerdotal
and prophetic caste, wielding vast influence, and
teaching, esoterically at least, a far more spiritual
religion.</p>

<p>H. 2.&mdash;These were the Druids, whose practices and
tenets fortunately excited such attention at Rome that
we know more about them by far than we could
collect concerning either Jews or Christians from
classical authors. And though most of our authorities
<span class="newpage"><a name="page62" id="page62">[62]</a></span>
refer to Druidism as practised in Gaul, yet we have
the authority of Caesar for Britain being the special
home and sanctuary of the faith, to which the Gallic
Druids referred as the standard for their practices.<a name="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
We may safely, therefore, take the pictures given us
by him and others, as supplying a representation of
what took place in our land ere the Romans entered it.</p>

<p>H. 3.&mdash;The earliest testimony is that of Julius
Caesar himself, in his well-known sketch of contemporary
Druidism ('De Bello Gallico,' vi. 14-20).
He tells us that the Druids were the ministers of
religion, the sacrificial priesthood of the nation, the
authorized expounders of the Divine will. All education
and jurisprudence was in their hands, and their
sentences of excommunication were universally enforced.
The Gallic Druids were under the dominion
of a Primate, who presided at the annual Chapter of
the Order, and was chosen by it; a disputed election
occasionally ending in an appeal to arms. As a rule,
however, Druids were supposed not to shed blood,
they were free from all obligation to military service,
and from all taxation of every kind. These privileges
enabled them to recruit their ranks&mdash;for they were
not an hereditary caste&mdash;from the pick of the national
youth, in spite of the severe discipline of the Druidical
novitiate. So great was the mass of sacred literature
required to be committed to memory that a training
of twenty years was sometimes needed. All had to
be learnt orally, for the matter was too sacred to be
written down, though the Druids were well acquainted
<span class="newpage"><a name="page63" id="page63">[63]</a></span>
with writing, and used the Greek alphabet,<a name="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> if not the
Greek language,<a name="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> for secular purposes. Caesar's own
view is that this refusal to allow the inditing of their
sacred books was due to two causes: first, the fear
lest the secrets of the Order should thus leak out, and,
secondly, the dread lest reading should weaken
memory, &quot;as, in fact, it generally does.&quot; Even so,
amongst the Brahmans there are, to this day, many
who can not only repeat from end to end the gigantic
mass of Vedic literature, but who know by heart also
with absolute accuracy the huge and complicated
works of the Sanscrit grammarians.</p>

<p>H. 4.&mdash;Caesar further tells us that the Druids taught
the doctrine of transmigration of souls, and that their
course of education included astronomy, geography,
physics, and theology. The attributes of their chief
God corresponded, in his view, with those of the
Roman Mercury. Of the minor divinities, one, like
Apollo, was the patron of healing; a second, like
Minerva, presided over craft-work; a third, like
Jupiter, was King of Heaven, and a fourth, like Mars,
was the War-god.<a name="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> Their calendar was constructed on
the principle that each night belongs to the day before
it (not to that after it, as was the theory amongst the
Mediterranean nations), and they reckoned all periods
<span class="newpage"><a name="page64" id="page64">[64]</a></span>
of time by nights, not days, as we still do in the
word &quot;fortnight.&quot; For this practice they gave the
mystical reason that the Celtic races were the Children
of Darkness. At periods of national or private distress,
human sacrifices were in vogue amongst them,
sometimes on a vast scale. &quot;They have images
[<i>simulacra</i>] of huge size, whose limbs when enclosed
[<i>contexta</i>] with wattles, they fill with living men.
The wattles are fired and the men perish amid the
hedge of flame [<i>circumventi flamma exanimantur
homines</i>].&quot; It is usually supposed that these <i>simulacra</i>
were hollow idols of basket-work. But such would
require to be constructed on an incredible scale for
their limbs to be filled with men; and it is much
more probable that they were spaces traced out upon
the ground (like the Giant on the hill above Cerne
Abbas in Dorset), and hedged in with the wattles to
be fired.</p>

<p>H. 5.&mdash;From the historian Diodorus Siculus, whose
life overlapped Caesar's, we learn that Druid was a
native British name. &quot;There are certain philosophers
and theologians held in great honour whom
they call Druids.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> Whether this designation is
actually of Celtic derivation is, however, uncertain.
Pliny thought it was from the Greek affected by the
Druids and connected with their oak-tree worship.
Professor Rhys mentions that the earliest use of the
word in extant Welsh literature is in the Book of
Taliesin, under the form <i>Derwyddon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> and that in
Irish is to be found the cognate form <i>Drui</i>. But
<span class="newpage"><a name="page65" id="page65">[65]</a></span>
these are as likely to be derived from the Greek
&#948;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962; [<b>drouides</b>], as this from them. Diodorus adds that they
have mighty influence, and preside at all sacred rites,
&quot;as possessing special knowledge of the Gods, yea,
and being of one speech &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#966;&#8061;&#957;&#969;&#957; [<b>homoph&ocirc;n&ocirc;n</b>] with them.&quot;
This points to some archaic or foreign language,
possibly Greek, being used in the Druidical ritual.
Their influence, he goes on to say, always makes for
peace: &quot;Oft-times, when hosts be arrayed, and
either side charging the one against the other, yea,
when swords are out and spears couched for the
onset, will these men rush between and stay the
warriors, charming them to rest &#954;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#960;&#8116;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; [<b>katepasantes</b>], like so
many wild beasts.&quot;</p>

<p>H. 6.&mdash;With the Druids Diodorus associates two
other religiously influential classes amongst the
Britons, the Bards (&#946;&#8049;&#961;&#948;&#959;&#953;) [<b>bardoi</b>] and the Seers (&#956;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#962;) [<b>manteis</b>].
The former present the familiar features of the cosmopolitan
minstrel. They sing to harps (&#8000;&#961;&#947;&#8049;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#955;&#8059;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#962; &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#8055;&#969;&#957;) [<b>organ&ocirc;n tais
lurais homoi&ocirc;n</b>], both fame and disfame. The latter
seem to have corresponded with the witch-doctors of
the Kaffir tribes, deriving auguries from the dying
struggles of their victims (frequently human), just as
the Basuto medicine-men tortured oxen to death to
prognosticate the issue of the war between Great
Britain and the Boers in South Africa. Strabo, in
the next generation, also mentions together these
three classes, Bards, Seers, &#959;&#8059;&#8049;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#962; [<b>Ouateis</b>] = Vates and Druids.
The latter study natural science and ethics (&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8134; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8055;&#8115; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7968;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8052;&#957; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#945;&#957;) [<b>pros t&ecirc;
phusiologia kai t&ecirc;n &ecirc;thik&ecirc;n philosophian askousin</b>]. They
teach the immortality of the soul, and believe the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page66" id="page66">[66]</a></span>
Universe to be eternal, &quot;yet, at the last, fire and
water shall prevail.&quot;</p>

<p>H. 7.&mdash;Pomponius Mela, who wrote shortly before
the Claudian conquest of Britain, says that the Druids
profess to know the shape and size of the world, the
movements of the stars, and the will of the Gods.
They teach many secrets in caves and woods, but
only to the nobles of the land. Of this esoteric
instruction one doctrine alone has been permitted to
leak out to the common people&mdash;that of the immortality
of the soul&mdash;and this only because that
doctrine was calculated to make them the braver in
battle. In accordance with it, food and the like was
buried with the dead, for the use of the soul. Even a
man's debts were supposed to pass with him to the
shades.</p>

<p>H. 8.&mdash;Our picture of the Druids is completed
by Pliny,<a name="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> writing shortly after the Claudian conquest.
Approaching the subject as a naturalist he
does not mention their psychological tenets, but gives
various highly interesting pieces of information as to
their superstitions with regard to natural objects,
especially plants. &quot;The Druids,&quot; he says, &quot;(so they
call their Magi) hold nothing so sacred as the mistletoe
and that tree whereon it groweth, if only this be an
oak. Oak-groves, indeed, they choose for their own
sake, neither do they celebrate any sacred rite without
oak-leaves, so that they appear to be called Druids
from the Greek word for this tree. Whatsoever
mistletoe, then, groweth on such a tree they hold it
<span class="newpage"><a name="page67" id="page67">[67]</a></span>
for a heaven-sent sign, and count that tree as chosen by
their God himself. Yet but very rarely is it so found,
and, when found, is sought with no small observance;
above all on the sixth day of the moon (which to
this folk is the beginning of months and years alike),<a name="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>
and after the thirtieth year of its age, because it is by
then in full vigour of strength, nor has its half-tide
yet come. Hailing it, in their own tongue, as
'Heal-all,' they make ready beneath the tree, with all
due rites, feast and sacrifice. Then are brought up
two bulls of spotless white, whose horns have never
ere this known the yoke. The priest, in white vestments,
climbeth the tree, and with a golden sickle reapeth the
sacred bough, which is caught as it falls in a white
robe [<i>sagum</i>]. Then, and not till then, slay they
the victims, praying that their God will prosper this
his gift to those on whom he hath bestowed the
same.&quot;</p>

<p>H. 9.&mdash;A drink made from mistletoe, or possibly the
mere insertion of the branch into drinking water, was
held by the Druids, Pliny adds, as an antidote to every
kind of poison. Other herbs had like remedial properties
in their eyes. The fumes of burning &quot;<i>selago</i>&quot;<a name="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>
were thus held good for affections of the eyesight,
only, however, when the plant was plucked with
<span class="newpage"><a name="page68" id="page68">[68]</a></span>
due ceremonies. The gatherer must be all in white,
with bare and washen feet, and must hallow himself,
ere starting on his quest, with a devotional partaking
of bread and wine [<i>sacro facto ... pane vinoque</i>].
He must by no means cut the sacred stem with a
knife, but pluck it, and that not with bare fingers, but
through the folds of his tunic, his right hand being
protruded for this purpose beneath his left, &quot;in
thievish wise&quot; [<i>velut a furante</i>]. Another herb,
&quot;<i>samolum</i>,&quot; which grew in marshy places, was of
avail in all diseases both of man and beast. It had
to be gathered with the left hand, and fasting, nor
might the gatherer on any account look back till he
reached some runlet [<i>canali</i>] in which he crushed his
prize and drank.</p>

<p>H. 10.&mdash;Pliny's picture has the interest of having
been drawn almost at the final disappearance of Druidism
from the Roman world. For some reason it was
supposed to be, like Christianity, peculiarly opposed
to the genius of Roman civilization, and never came
to be numbered amongst the <i>religiones licitae</i> of the
Empire. Augustus forbade the practice of it to
Roman citizens,<a name="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> Tiberius wholly suppressed it in
Gaul,<a name="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> and, in conquering Britain, Claudius crushed
it with a hand of iron. Few pictures in the early
history of Britain are more familiar than the final
extirpation of the last of the Druids, when their
sacred island of Mona (Anglesey) was stormed by the
Roman legionaries, and priests and priestesses perished
<span class="newpage"><a name="page69" id="page69">[69]</a></span>
<i>en masse</i> in the flames of their own altars.<a name="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> Their
desperate resistance was doubtless due to the fact
that Rome was the declared and mortal enemy of
their faith. So baneful, indeed, did Druidism come
to be considered, that to hold even with the least of
its superstitions was treated at Rome as a capital
offence. Pliny tells us of a Roman knight, of Gallic
birth, who was put to death by Claudius for no other
reason than that of being in possession of a certain
stone called by the Druids a &quot;snake's egg,&quot; and
supposed to bring good luck in law-suits.<a name="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p>H. 11.&mdash;This stone Pliny himself had seen, and
describes it (in his chapter on the use of eggs)
as being like a medium-sized apple, having a
cartilaginous shell covered with small processes like
the discs on the arms of an octopus. This can
scarcely have been, as most commentators suppose,
the shell of an echinus (with which Pliny was
well acquainted), even if fossil. His description
rather seems to point to some fossil covered with
<i>ostrea sigillina</i>, such as are common in British
green-sands. He adds an account of the Druidical view of
its production, how it is the solidified poison of a
number of serpents who put their heads together to
eject it, and how, even when set in gold, it will float,
and that against a stream. This &quot;egg,&quot; it will be seen,
was from Gaul. The British variant of the superstition
was that the snakes thus formed a ring of
poison matter, larger or smaller according to the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page70" id="page70">[70]</a></span>
number engaged, which solidified into a gem known
as <i>Glain naidr</i>, &quot;Adder's glass.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> The small rings of
green or blue glass, too thick for wear, which are not
uncommonly found in British burial-places, are
supposed to represent this gem. So also, possibly,
are the much larger rings of roughly-baked clay which
occur throughout the Roman period. For superstitions
die hard, and Gough assures us that even in
1789 such &quot;adder-beads&quot; or &quot;snake-stones&quot; were
considered &quot;lucky&quot; in Wales and Cornwall, and were
still ascribed to the same source as by the Druids
of old.</p>

<p>H. 12.&mdash;After its suppression by Claudius, Druidism
still lingered on in Britain beyond the Roman pale,
and amid the outlaws of the Armorican forests in
Gaul, but in a much lower form. The least worthy
representatives of the Brahmanic caste in India are those
found in the least civilized regions, whose tendency is
to become little better than sorcerers.<a name="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> And in like
manner it is as sorcerers that the later Druids of
Scotland and Ireland meet us in their legendary
encounters with St. Patrick and St. Columba. They
are called &quot;The School of Simon the Druid&quot; (<i>i.e.</i>
Simon Magus), and a 9th-century commentary designates
Jannes and Jambres as &quot;Druids.&quot; But the
word did not wholly lose its higher associations. It
<span class="newpage"><a name="page71" id="page71">[71]</a></span>
is applied to the Wise Men in an early Welsh hymn
on the Epiphany; and in another, ascribed to
Columba himself, the saint goes so far as to say,
&quot;Christ, the Son of God, is my <i>Druid</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<h3>THE JULIAN INVASION, B.C. 55, 54</h3>
<br />

<a name="AII."></a><h4>SECTION A.</h4>

<p><i>Caesar and Britain&mdash;Breakdown of Roman Republican institutions&mdash;Corruption abroad and at<br />
home&mdash;Rise of Caesar&mdash;Conquest of Gaul.</i></p>
<br />
<p>A. 1.&mdash;If the connection of Britain with Rome is
the pivot on which the whole history of our island
turns, it is no less true that the first connection of
Rome with Britain is the pivot whereon all Roman
history depends. For its commencement marks the
furthest point reached in his career of conquest by
the man without whom Roman history must needs
have come to a shameful and disastrous end&mdash;Julius
Caesar.</p>

<p>A. 2.&mdash;The old Roman constitution and the old
Roman character had alike proved wholly unequal
to meet the strain thrown upon them by the acquisition
of the world-wide empire which they had gained for
their city. Under the stress of the long feud between
its Patrician and Plebeian elements that constitution
had developed into an instrument for the regulation of
public affairs, admirably adapted for a City-state, where
<span class="newpage"><a name="page74" id="page74">[74]</a></span>
each magistrate performs his office under his neighbour's
eye and over his own constituents; constantly amenable
both to public opinion and to the checks provided
by law. But it never contemplated Pro-consuls bearing
sway over the unenfranchised populations of distant
Provinces, whence news filtered through to Rome but
slowly, and where such legal checks as a man had to
reckon with were in the hands of a Court far more
ready to sympathize with the oppression of non-voters
than to resent it.</p>

<p>A. 3.&mdash;And these officials had deteriorated from
the old Roman rectitude, as the Spartan harmosts
deteriorated under conditions exactly similar in the
days of the Lacedaemonian supremacy over Hellas.
And, in both cases, the whole national character was
dragged down by the degradation of what we may call
the Colonial executive. Like the Spartan, the Roman
of &quot;the brave days of old&quot; was often stern, and even
brutal, towards his enemies. But he was a devoted
patriot, he was true to his plighted faith, and above
all he was free from all taint of pecuniary corruption.
The earlier history of both nations is full of legends
illustrating these points, which, whether individually
true or not, bear abundant testimony to the national
ideal. But with irresponsible power, Roman and
Spartan alike, while remaining as brutally indifferent
as ever to the sufferings of others, lost all that was
best in his own ethical equipment. Instead of
patriotism we find unblushing self-interest as the
motive of every action; in place of good faith, the
most shameless dishonesty; and, for the old contempt
<span class="newpage"><a name="page75" id="page75">[75]</a></span>
of ill-gotten gains, a corruption so fathomless
and all-pervading as fairly to stagger us. The tale of
the doings of Verres in a district so near Rome as
Sicily shows us a depth of mire and degeneration to
which no constitution could sink and live.</p>

<p>A. 4.&mdash;Nor could the Roman constitution survive
it. From the Provinces the taint spread with fatal
rapidity to the City itself. The thirst for lucre
became the leading force in the State; for its sake
the Classes more and more trampled down the Masses;
and entrance to the Classes was a matter no longer of
birth, but of money alone. And all history testifies
that the State which becomes a plutocracy is doomed
indeed. Of all possible forms of government&mdash;autocracy,
oligarchy, democracy&mdash;that is the lowest, that
most surely bears within itself the seeds of its own
inevitable ruin.</p>

<p>A. 5.&mdash;So it was with the Roman Republic. As
soon as this stage was reached it began to &quot;stew in
its own juice&quot; with appalling rapidity. Reformers,
like the Gracchi, were crushed; and the commonwealth
went to pieces under the shocks and counter-shocks
of demagogues like Clodius, conspirators like
Catiline, and military adventurers such as Marius and
Sulla&mdash;for whose statue the Senate could find no
more constitutional title than &quot;The Lucky General&quot;
[<i>Sullae Imperatori Felici</i>] Well-meaning individuals,
such as Cicero and Pompey, were still to be found,
and even came to the front, but they all alike proved
unequal to the crisis; which, in fact, threw up one
man, and one only, of force to become a real maker
<span class="newpage"><a name="page76" id="page76">[76]</a></span>
of history&mdash;Caius Julius Caesar, the first Roman
invader of Britain.</p>

<p>A. 6.&mdash;Caesar was at the time of this invasion (55 B.C.)
some forty-five years old; but he had not long become
a real power in the political arena. Sprung from the
bluest blood of Rome&mdash;the Julian House tracing their
origin to the mythical Iulus, son of Aeneas, and thus
claiming descent from the Goddess Venus&mdash;we might
have expected to find him enrolled amongst the aristocratic
conservatives, the champions of the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of
Sulla. But though a mere boy at the date of the strife
between the partisans of Sulla and Marius (B.C. 88-78),
Caesar was already clear-sighted enough to perceive
that in the &quot;Classes&quot; of that day there was no help
for the tempest-tossed commonwealth. Accordingly
he threw in his lot with the revolutionary Marian
movement, broke off a wealthy matrimonial engagement
arranged for him by his parents to become the
son-in-law of Cinna, and in the very thick of the
Sullan proscriptions, braved the Dictator by openly
glorying in his connection with the defeated reformers.
How he escaped with his life, even at the intercession,
if it was indeed made, of the Vestals, is a
mystery; for Sulla (who had little regard for religious,
or any other, scruples) was deliberately extirpating
every soul whom he thought dangerous to the plutocracy,
and is said to have pronounced &quot;that boy&quot; as
&quot;more to be dreaded than many a Marius.&quot; He did,
however, escape; but till the vanquished party
recovered in some degree from this ruthless massacre
of their leaders, he could take no prominent part in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page77" id="page77">[77]</a></span>
politics. The minor offices of Quaestor, Aedile, and
Praetor he filled with credit, and meanwhile seemed
to be giving himself up to shine in Society, which was
not, in Rome, then at its best; and his reputation for
intrigue, his skill at the gaming-table, and his
fashionable swagger were the envy of all the young
bloods of the day.</p>

<p>A. 7.&mdash;The Catiline conspiracy (B.C. 63), and the
irregular executions that followed its suppression, at
length gave him his opportunity. While the Senate
was hailing Cicero as &quot;the Father of his country&quot; for
the stern promptitude which enabled him, as Consul,
to say &quot;<i>Vixere</i>&quot; [&quot;They <i>have</i> lived&quot;] in answer to
the question as to the doom of the conspirators,
Caesar had electrified the assembly by his denunciation
of the view that, in whatsoever extremity, the blood of
Roman citizens might be shed by a Roman Consul,
secretly and without legal warrant. Henceforward he
took his place as the special leader on whom popular
feeling at Rome more and more pinned its hopes.
As Pontifex Maximus he gained (B.C. 63) a shadowy
but far from unreal religious influence; as Pro-praetor
he solidified the Roman dominion in Spain (where he
had already been Quaestor); and on his return (B.C. 60)
reconciled Crassus, the head of the moneyed interest,
with Pompey, the darling of the Army, and by their
united influence was raised next year to the Consulship.</p>

<p>A. 8.&mdash;A Roman Consul invariably, after the expiration
of his year of office, was sent as Pro-consul
to take charge of one of the Provinces, practically
having a good deal of personal say as to which should
<span class="newpage"><a name="page78" id="page78">[78]</a></span>
be assigned to him. Caesar thus chose for his proconsular
government the district of Gaul then under
Roman dominion, <i>i.e.</i> the valley of the Po, and
that of the Rhone. In making this choice Caesar
was actuated by the fact that in Gaul he was more
likely than anywhere else to come in for active service.
Unquiet neighbours on the frontier, Germans and
Helvetians, were threatening invasion, and would
have to be repelled. And this would give the Pro-consul
the chance of doing what Caesar specially
desired, of raising and training an army which he
might make as devoted to himself as were Pompey's
veterans to their brilliant chieftain&mdash;the hero &quot;as
beautiful as he was brave, as good as he was beautiful.&quot;
Without such a force Caesar foresaw that all
his efforts to redress the abuses of the State would
be in vain. As Consul he had carried certain small
instalments of reform; but they had made him more
hated than ever by the classes at whose corruption
they were aimed, and might any day be overthrown.
And neither Pompey nor Crassus were in any way to
be depended upon for his plans in this direction.</p>

<p>A. 9.&mdash;Events proved kinder to him than he could
have hoped. His ill-wishers at Rome actually aided
his preparations for war; for Caesar had not yet
gained any special military reputation, while the
barbarians whom he was to meet had a very high
one, and might reasonably be expected to destroy
him. And the Helvetian peril proved of such
magnitude that he had every excuse for making a
much larger levy than there was any previous prospect
<span class="newpage"><a name="page79" id="page79">[79]</a></span>
of his securing. On the surpassing genius with which
he manipulated the weapon thus put into his hand
there is no need to dwell. Suffice it to say that
in spite of overwhelming superiority in numbers,
courage yet more signal, a stronger individual
physique, and arms as effective, his foes one after
another vanished before him. Helvetians, Germans,
Belgians, were not merely conquered, but literally
annihilated, as often as they ventured to meet him, and
in less than three years the whole of Gaul was at his feet.</p>

<a name="BII."></a><h4>SECTION B.</h4>

<p><i>Sea-fight with Veneti and Britons&mdash;Pretexts for invading Britain&mdash;British dominion of Divitiacus<br />
&mdash;Gallic tribes in Britain&mdash;Atrebates&mdash;Commius.</i></p>
<br />
<p>B. 1.&mdash;One of the last tribes to be subdued (in
B.C. 56) was that which, as the chief seafaring race
of Gaul, had the most intimate relations with Britain,
the Veneti, or men of Vannes, who dwelt in what
is now Brittany.<a name="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> These enterprising mariners had
developed a form of vessel fitted to cope with the
stormy Chops of the Channel on lines exactly
opposite to those of the British &quot;curraghs.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> Instead
of being so light as to rise to every lift of the waves,
and with frames so flexible as to bend rather than break
under their every stress, the Venetian ships were of the
most massive construction, built wholly of the stoutest
oak planking, and with timbers upwards of a foot in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page80" id="page80">[80]</a></span>
thickness. All were bolted together with iron pins
&quot;as thick as a man's thumb.&quot; Forecastle and poop
were alike lofty, with a lower waist for the use of
sweeps if needful. But this was only exceptional,
sails being the usual motive power. And these were
constructed chiefly with a view to strength. Instead
of canvas, they were formed of untanned hides. And
instead of hempen cables the Veneti were so far
ahead of their time as to use iron chains with their
anchors; an invention which perished with them,
not to come in again till the 19th century. Their
broad beam and shallow keel enabled these ships to
lie more conveniently in the tidal inlets on either
side of the Channel.<a name="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p>B. 2.&mdash;Thus equipped, the Veneti had tapped the
tin trade at its source, and established emporia at
Falmouth, Plymouth, and Exmouth; on the sites of
which ancient ingots, Gallic coins of gold, and other
relics of their period have lately been discovered.
Thence they conveyed their freight to the Seine, the
Loire, and even the Garonne. The great Damnonian
clan, which held the whole of Devon and Cornwall,
were in close alliance with them, and sent auxiliaries
to aid in their final struggle against Caesar. Indeed
they may possibly have drawn allies from a yet wider
area, if, as Mr. Elton conjectures, the prehistoric
boats which have at various times been found in the
silt at Glasgow may be connected with their influence.<a name="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page81" id="page81">[81]</a></span>
<p>B. 3.&mdash;Caesar describes his struggle with the Veneti
and their British allies as one of the most arduous
in his Gallic campaigns. The Roman war galleys
depended largely upon ramming in their sea-fights,
but the Venetian ships were so solidly built as to
defy this method of attack. At the same time their
lofty prows and sterns enabled them to deliver a
plunging fire of missiles on the Roman decks, and
even to command the wooden turrets which Caesar
had added to his bulwarks. They invariably fought
under sail, and manoeuvred so skilfully that boarding
was impossible. In the end, after several unsuccessful
skirmishes, Caesar armed his marines with long billhooks,
instructing them to strike at the halyards of
the Gallic vessels as they swept past. (These must
have been fastened outboard.) The device succeeded.
One after another, in a great battle off Quiberon,
of which the Roman land force were spectators, the
huge leathern mainsails dropped on to the decks,
doubtless &quot;covering the ship as with a pall,&quot; as in
the like misfortune to the Elizabethan <i>Revenge</i> in her
heroic defence against the Spanish fleet, and hopelessly
crippling the vessel, whether for sailing or rowing.
The Romans were at last able to board, and the
whole Venetian fleet fell into their hands. The
strongholds on the coast were now stormed, and the
entire population either slaughtered or sold into
slavery, as an object lesson to the rest of the
confederacy of the fate in store for those who dared
to stand out against the Genius of Rome.</p>

<p>B. 4.&mdash;Caesar had now got a very pretty excuse for
<span class="newpage"><a name="page82" id="page82">[82]</a></span>
extending his operations to Britain, and, as his object
was to pose at Rome as &quot;a Maker of Empire,&quot; he
eagerly grasped at the chance. Something of a
handle, moreover, was afforded him by yet another
connection between the two sides of the Channel.
Many people were still alive who remembered the
days when Divitiacus, King of the Suessiones (at
Soissons), had been the great potentate of Northern
Gaul. In Caesar's time this glory was of the past,
and the Suessiones had sunk to a minor position
amongst the Gallic clans. But within the last half-century
the sway of their monarch had been acknowledged
not only over great part of Gaul, but in
Britain also. Caesar's words, indeed, would almost
seem to point to the island as a whole having been
in some sense under him: <i>Etiam Britanniae imperium
obtinuit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p>B. 5.&mdash;And traces of his rule still existed in the
occupation of British districts by colonists from two
tribes, which, as his nearest neighbours, must certainly
have formed part of any North Gallic confederacy
under him&mdash;the Atrebates and the Parisii. The
former had their continental seat in Picardy; the
latter, as their name tells us, on the Seine. Their
insular settlements were along the southern bank of
the Thames and the northern bank of the Humber
respectively. How far the two sets of Parisians held
together politically does not appear; but the Atrebates,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page83" id="page83">[83]</a></span>
whether in Britain or Gaul, acknowledged the claim
of a single magnate, named Commius, to be their paramount
Chieftain.<a name="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> In this capacity he had led his
followers against Caesar in the great Belgic confederacy
of B.C. 58, and on its collapse, instead of holding
out to the last like the Nervii, had made a timely
submission. If convenient, this submission might be
represented as including that of his British dominions;
especially as we gather that a contingent from over-sea
may have actually fought under his banner
against the Roman eagles. Nay, it is possible that
the old claims of the ruler of Soissons over Britain
may have been revived, now that that ruler was Julius
Caesar. It is even conceivable that his complaint of
British assistance having been given to the enemy
&quot;in all our Gallic wars&quot; may point to his having
heard some form of the legend, whose echoes we
meet with in Welsh Triads, that the Gauls who sacked
Rome three centuries earlier numbered Britons amongst
their ranks.</p>

<p><i>Defeat of Germans&mdash;Bridge over Rhine&mdash;Caesar's army&mdash;Dread of ocean&mdash;Fleet at Boulogne<br />
&mdash;Commius sent to Britain&mdash;Channel crossed&mdash;Attempt on Dover&mdash;Landing at Deal&mdash;Legionary<br />
sentiment&mdash;British army dispersed.</i></p>
<br />
<p>C. 1.&mdash;For making use of these pretexts, however,
Caesar had to wait a while. It was needful to bring
<span class="newpage"><a name="page84" id="page84">[84]</a></span>
home to both supporters and opponents his brilliant
success by showing himself in Rome, during the idle
season when his men were in winter quarters. And
when he got back to his Province with the spring
of A.D. 55, his first attention had to be given to
the Rhine frontier, whence a formidable German
invasion was threatening. With his usual skill and
war-craft&mdash;which, on this occasion, in the eyes of his
Roman ill-wishers, seemed indistinguishable from
treachery&mdash;he annihilated the Teutonic horde which
had dared to cross the river; and then, by a miracle
of engineering skill, bridged the broad and rapid
stream, and made such a demonstration in Germany
itself as to check the national trek westward for
half a millennium.</p>

<p>C. 2.&mdash;By this time, as this wonderful feat shows,
the Army of Gaul had become one of those perfect
instruments into which only truly great commanders
can weld their forces. Like the Army of the Peninsula,
in the words of Wellington, &quot;it could go anywhere
and do anything.&quot; The men who, when first enlisted,
had trembled before the Gauls, and absolutely
shed tears at the prospect of encountering Germans,
now, under the magic of Caesar's genius, had learnt
to dread nothing. Often surprised, always outnumbered,
sometimes contending against tenfold odds,
the legionaries never faltered. Each individual soldier
seems to have learnt to do instinctively the right
thing in every emergency, and every man worshipped
his general. For every man could see that it was
Caesar and Caesar alone to whom every victory was
<span class="newpage"><a name="page85" id="page85">[85]</a></span>
due. The very training of the engineers, the very
devices, such as that of the Rhine bridge, by which
such mighty results were achieved, were all due to
him. Never before had any Roman leader, not even
Pompey &quot;the Great,&quot; awakened such devotion amongst
his followers.</p>

<p>C. 3.&mdash;Caesar therefore experienced no such difficulty
as we shall find besetting the Roman commanders
of the next century, in persuading his men to follow
him &quot;beyond the world,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> and to dare the venture,
hitherto unheard of in the annals of Rome, of crossing
the ocean itself. We must remember that this
crossing was looked upon by the Romans as something
very different from the transits hither and thither
upon the Mediterranean Sea with which they were
familiar. The Ocean to them was an object of
mysterious horror. Untold possibilities of destruction
might lurk in its tides and billows. Whence those
tides came and how far those billows rolled was
known to no man. To dare its passage might well
be to court Heaven knew what of supernatural
vengeance.</p>

<p>C. 4.&mdash;But Caesar's men were ready to brave all
things while he led them. So, after having despatched
his German business, he determined to employ the
short remainder of the summer in a <i>reconnaissance en
force</i> across the Channel, with a view to subsequent
<span class="newpage"><a name="page86" id="page86">[86]</a></span>
invasion of Britain. He had already made inquiries
of all whom he could find connected with the
Britanno-Gallic trade as to the size and military
resources of the island. But they proved unwilling
witnesses, and he could not even get out of them
what they must perfectly well have known, the position
of the best harbours on the southern shores.</p>

<p>C. 5.&mdash;His first act, therefore, was to send out a
galley under Volusenus &quot;to pry along the coast,&quot;
and meanwhile to order the fleet which he had built
against the Veneti to rendezvous at Boulogne. Besides
these war-galleys (<i>naves longae</i>) he got together
eighty transports, enough for two legions, besides
eighteen more for the cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> These last were
detained by a contrary wind at &quot;a further harbour,&quot;
eight miles distant&mdash;probably Ambleteuse at the
mouth of the Canche.<a name="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p>C. 6.&mdash;All these preparations, though they seem to
have been carried out with extreme celerity, lasted
long enough to alarm the Britons. Several clans
sent over envoys, to promise submission if only
Caesar would refrain from invading the country. This,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page87" id="page87">[87]</a></span>
however, did not suit Caesar's purpose. Such diplomatic
advantages would be far less impressive in the
eyes of the Roman &quot;gallery&quot; to which he was playing
than his actual presence in Britain. So he merely
told the envoys that it would be all the better for
them if he found them in so excellent and submissive
a frame of mind on his arrival at their shores, and
sent them back, along with Commius, who was to
bring in his own clan, the Atrebates, and as many
more as he could influence. And the Britons on
their part, though ready to make a nominal submission
to &quot;the mighty name of Rome,&quot; were resolved not
to tolerate an actual invasion without a fight for it.
In every clan the war party came to the front, all
negotiations were abruptly broken off, Commius was
thrown into chains, and a hastily-summoned levy
lined the coast about Dover, where the enemy were
expected to make their first attempt to land.</p>

<p>C. 7.&mdash;Dover, in fact, was the port that Caesar made
for. It was, at this date, the obvious harbour for
such a fleet as his. All along the coast of Kent the
sea has, for many centuries, been constantly retreating.
Partly by the silting-up of river-mouths, partly by the
great drift of shingle from west to east which is so
striking a feature of our whole southern shore, fresh
land has everywhere been forming. Places like Rye
and Winchelsea, which were well-known havens of the
Cinque Ports even to late mediaeval times, are now
far inland. And though Dover is still our great
south-eastern harbour, this is due entirely to the
artificial extensions which have replaced the naturally
<span class="newpage"><a name="page88" id="page88">[88]</a></span>
enclosed tidal area for which Caesar made. There is
abundant evidence that in his day the site of the
present town was the bed of an estuary winding for a
mile or more inland between steep chalk cliffs,<a name="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> not
yet denuded into slopes, whence the beach on either
side was absolutely commanded.</p>

<p>C. 8.&mdash;Caesar saw at a glance that a landing here
was impossible to such a force as he had with him.
He had sailed from Boulogne &quot;in the third watch&quot;&mdash;with
the earliest dawn, that is to say&mdash;and by 10 a.m.
his leading vessels, with himself on board, were close
under Shakespeare's Cliff. There he saw the British
army in position waiting for him, crowning the heights
above the estuary, and ready to overwhelm his landing-parties
with a plunging fire of missiles. He anchored
for a space till the rest of his fleet came up, and
meanwhile called a council of war of his leading
officers to deliberate on the best way of proceeding
in the difficulty. It was decided to make for the
open shore to the northwards (perhaps for Richborough,<a name="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a>
the next secure roadstead of those days), and at three
in the afternoon the trumpet sounded, the anchors were
weighed, and the fleet coasted onwards with the flowing
tide.<a name="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p>C. 9.&mdash;The British army also struck camp, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page89" id="page89">[89]</a></span>
kept pace by land with the invaders' progress. First
came the cavalry and chariot-men, the mounted
infantry of the day; then followed the main body,
who in the British as in every army, ancient or
modern, fought on foot. We can picture the scene,
the bright harvest afternoon&mdash;(according to the
calculations of Napoleon, in his 'Life of Caesar,' it
was St. Bartholomew's Day)&mdash;the calm sea, the long
Roman galleys with their rows of sweeps, the heavier
and broader transports with their great mainsails
rounding out to the gentle breeze, and on cliff and
beach the British ranks in their waving tartans&mdash;each
clan, probably, distinguished by its own pattern&mdash;the
bright armour of the chieftains, the thick array of
weapons, and in front the mounted contingent hurrying
onwards to give the foe a warm greeting ere he
could set foot on shore.</p>

<p>C. 10.&mdash;Thus did invaders and defenders move on,
for some seven miles, passing, as Dio Cassius notes,
beneath the lofty cliffs of the South Foreland,<a name="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> till
these died down into the flat shore and open beach
of Deal. By this time it must have been nearly five
o'clock, and if Caesar was to land at all that day it
must be done at once. Anchor was again cast; but
so flat was the shore that the transports, which drew
at least four feet of water, could not come within
some distance of it. Between the legionaries and the
land stretched yards of sea, shoulder-deep to begin
with, and concealing who could say what treacherous
<span class="newpage"><a name="page90" id="page90">[90]</a></span>
holes and quicksands beneath its surface. And their
wading had to be done under heavy fire; for the
British cavalry and chariots had already come up,
and occupied every yard of the beach, greeting with
a shower of missiles every motion of the Romans to
disembark. This was more than even Caesar's soldiers
were quite prepared to face. The men, small shame
to them, hesitated, and did not spring overboard with
the desired alacrity. Caesar's galleys, however, were
of lighter draught, and with them he made a demonstration
on the right flank (the <i>latus apertum</i> of
ancient warfare, the shield being on every man's <i>left</i>
arm) of the British; who, under a severe fire of slings,
arrows, and catapults, drew back, though only a little,
to take up a new formation, and their fire, in turn,
was for the moment silenced. And that moment was
seized for a gallant feat of arms which shows how
every rank of Caesar's army was animated by Caesar's
spirit.</p>

<p>C. II.&mdash;The ensign of every Roman legion was the
Roman Eagle, perched upon the head of the standard-pole,
and regarded with all, and more than all, the feeling
which our own regiments have for their regimental
colours. As with them, the staff which bore the
Eagle of the Legion also bore inscriptions commemorating
the honours and victories the legion had won, and
to lose it to the foe was an even greater disgrace
than with us. For a Roman legion was a much
larger unit than a modern regiment, and corresponded
rather to a Division; indeed, in the completeness of
its separate organization, it might almost be called an
<span class="newpage"><a name="page91" id="page91">[91]</a></span>
Army Corps. Six thousand was its normal force in
infantry, and it had its own squadrons of cavalry
attached, its own engineer corps, its own baggage train,
and its own artillery of catapults and balistae.<a name="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> There
was thus even more legionary feeling in the Roman
army than there is regimental feeling in our own.</p>

<p>C. 12.&mdash;At this time, however, this feeling, so potent
in its effects subsequently, was a new development.
Caesar himself would seem to have been the first to see
how great an incentive such divisional sentiment might
prove, and to have done all he could to encourage it.
He had singled out one particular legion, the Tenth,
as his own special favourite, and made its soldiers feel
themselves the objects of his special regard. And this
it was which now saved the day for him. The colour-sergeant
of that legion, seeing the momentary opening
given by the flanking movement of the galleys, after
a solemn prayer that this might be well for his legion,
plunged into the sea, ensign in hand. &quot;Over with you,
comrades,&quot; he cried, &quot;if you would not see your
Eagle taken by the enemy.&quot; With a universal shout
of &quot;Never, never&quot; the legion followed; the example
spread from ship to ship, and the whole Roman army
was splashing and struggling towards the shore of
Britain.</p>

<p>C. 13.&mdash;At the same time this was no easy task.
As every bather knows, it is not an absolutely
straightforward matter for even an unencumbered man to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page92" id="page92">[92]</a></span>
effect a landing upon a shingle beach, if ever so little
swell is on. And the Roman soldier had to keep his
footing, and use his arms moreover for fighting, with
some half-hundredweight of accoutrements about him.
To form rank was, of course, out of the question.
The men forced their way onward, singly and in little
groups, often having to stand back to back in
rallying-squares, as soon as they came within hand-stroke
of the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> And this was before they reached dry
land. For the British cavalry and chariots dashed into
the water to meet them, making full use of the advantage
which horsemen have under such circumstances,
able to ply the full swing of their arms unembarrassed
by the waves, not lifted off their feet or rolled over by
the swell, and delivering their blows from above on
foes already in difficulties. And on their side, they
copied the flanking movement of the Romans, and
wheeled round a detachment to fire upon the <i>latus
apertum</i> of such invaders as succeeded in reaching
shallower water.</p>

<p>C. 14.&mdash;Thus the fight, in Caesar's words, was an
exceedingly sharp one. It was not decided till he
sent in the boats of his galleys, and any other light
craft he had, to mingle with the combatants. These
<span class="newpage"><a name="page93" id="page93">[93]</a></span>
could doubtless get right alongside the British chariots;
and now the advantage of position came to be the
other way. A troop of irregular horsemen up to their
girths in water is no match for a boat's crew of
disciplined infantry. Moreover the tide was flowing,<a name="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a>
and driving the Britons back moment by moment.
For a while they yet resisted bravely, but discipline
had the last word. Yard by yard the Romans
won their way, till at length they set foot ashore,
formed up on the beach in that open order<a name="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> which
made the unique strength of the Legions, and delivered
their irresistible charge. The Britons did not wait
for the shock. Their infantry was, probably, already
in retreat, covered by the cavalry and chariots, who
now in their turn gave rein to their ponies and retired
at a gallop.</p>

<p>C. 15.&mdash;Caesar saw them go, and bitterly felt that
his luck had failed him. Had he but cavalry, this
retreat might have been turned into a rout. But his
eighteen transports had failed to arrive, and his
drenched and exhausted infantry were in no case for
effective pursuit of a foe so superior in mobility.
Moreover the sun must have been now fast sinking,
and all speed had to be made to get the camp fortified
<span class="newpage"><a name="page94" id="page94">[94]</a></span>
before nightfall. But the Roman soldier was an adept
at entrenching himself. A rampart was hastily thrown
up, the galleys beached at the top of the tide and run
up high and dry beyond the reach of the surf, the
transports swung to their anchors where the ebb would
not leave them grounded, the quarters of the various
cohorts assigned them, the sentries and patrols duly
set; and under the summer moon, these first of the
Roman invaders lay down for their first night on
British soil.</p>

<br />
<p>D. 1.&mdash;Meanwhile the defeated Britons had made
off, probably to their camp above Dover, where their
leaders' first act, on rallying, was to send their prisoner,
Commius, under a flag of truce to Caesar, with a
promise of unconditional submission. That his landing
had been opposed, was, they declared, no fault
of theirs; it was all the witlessness of their ignorant
followers, who had insisted on fighting. Would he
overlook it? Yes; Caesar was ready to show this
clemency; but, after conduct so very like treachery,
considering their embassy to him in Gaul, he must
insist on hostages, and plenty of them. A few were
accordingly sent in, and the rest promised in a few
days, being the quota due from more distant clans.
The British forces were disbanded; indeed, as it was
harvest time, they could scarcely have been kept
embodied anyhow; and a great gathering of chieftains
<span class="newpage"><a name="page95" id="page95">[95]</a></span>
was held at which it was resolved that all alike should
acknowledge the suzerainty of Rome.</p>

<p>D. 2.&mdash;This assembly seems to have been held on
the morrow of the battle or the day after, so that it
can only have been attended by the local Kentish
chiefs, unless we are to suppose (as may well have
been the case), that the Army of Dover comprised
levies and captains from other parts of Britain. But
whatever it was, before the resolution could be carried
into effect an unlooked-for accident changed the whole
situation.</p>

<p>D. 3.&mdash;On the fourth day after the Roman landing,
the south-westerly wind which had carried Caesar
across shifted a few points to the southward. The
eighteen cavalry transports were thus enabled to leave
Ambleteuse harbour, and were seen approaching before
a gentle breeze. The wind, however, continued to
back against the sun, and, as usual, to freshen in doing
so. Thus, before they could make the land, it was
blowing hard from the eastward, and there was nothing
for them but to bear up. Some succeeded in getting
back to the shelter of the Gallic shore, others scudded
before the gale and got carried far to the west, probably
rounding-to under the lee of Beachy Head, where they
anchored. For this, however, there was far too much
sea running. Wave after wave dashed over the bows,
they were in imminent danger of swamping, and,
when the tide turned at nightfall, they got under
weigh and shaped the best course they could to the
southern shore of the Channel.</p>

<p>D. 4.&mdash;And this same tide that thus carried away his
<span class="newpage"><a name="page96" id="page96">[96]</a></span>
reinforcements all but wrecked Caesar's whole fleet at
Deal. His mariners had strangely forgotten that with
the full moon the spring tides would come on; a
phenomenon which had been long ago remarked by
Pytheas,<a name="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> and with which they themselves must have
been perfectly familiar on the Gallic coast. And this
tide was not only a spring, but was driven by a gale
blowing straight on shore. Thus the sleeping soldiers
were aroused by the spray dashing over them, and
awoke to find the breakers pounding into their galleys
on the beach; while, of the transports, some dragged
their anchors and were driven on shore to become
total wrecks, some cut their cables, and beat, as
best they might, out to sea, and all, when the tide
and wind alike went down, were found next morning
in wretched plight. Not an anchor or cable, says
Caesar, was left amongst them, so that it was impossible
for them to keep their station off the shore by
the camp.</p>

<p>D. 5.&mdash;The army, not unnaturally, was in dismay.
They were merely on a reconnaissance, without any
supply of provisions, without even their usual baggage;
perhaps without tents, certainly without any means of
repairing the damage to the fleet. Get back to Gaul
for the winter they must under pain of starvation, and
where were the ships to take them?</p>

<p>D. 6.&mdash;The Britons, on the other hand, felt that
their foes were now delivered into their hands. Instead
of the submission they were arranging, the Council
of the Chiefs resolved to make the most of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page97" id="page97">[97]</a></span>
opportunity, and teach the world by a great example that
Britain was not a safe place to invade. Nor need this
cost many British lives. They had only to refuse
the Romans food; what little could be got by foraging
would soon be exhausted; then would come the
winter, and the starving invaders would fall an easy
prey. The annihilation of the entire expedition would
damp Roman ambitions against Britain for many a
long day. A solemn oath bound one and all to this
plan, and every chief secretly began to levy his
clansmen afresh.</p>

<p>D. 7.&mdash;Naturally, hostages ceased to be sent in;
but it did not need this symptom to show Caesar in
how tight a place he now was. His only chance was
to strain every nerve to get his ships refitted; and by
breaking up those most damaged, and ordering what
materials were available from the Continent, he did
in a week or two succeed in rendering some sixty out
of his eighty vessels just seaworthy.</p>

<p>D. 8.&mdash;And while this work was in progress, another
event showed how imperative was his need and how
precarious his situation. He had, in fact, been guilty
of a serious military blunder in going with a mere flying
column into Britain as he had gone into Germany.
The Channel was not the Rhine, and ships were
exposed to risks from which his bridge had been
entirely exempt. Nothing but a crushing defeat
would cut him off from retiring by that; but the
Ocean was not to be so bridled.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page98" id="page98">[98]</a></span>

<p>D. 9.&mdash;It was, as we have said, the season of
harvest, and the corn was not yet cut, though the
men of Kent were busily at work in the fields. With
regard to the crops nearest the camp, the legionaries
spared them the trouble of reaping, by commandeering
the corn themselves, the area of their operations
having, of course, to be continually extended.
Harvesters numbered by the thousand make quick
work; and in a day or two the whole district was
cleared, either by Roman or Briton. Caesar's scouts
could only bring him word of one unreaped field,
bordered by thick woodland, a mile or two from the
camp, and hidden from it by a low swell of the
ground. Mr. Vine, in his able monograph 'Caesar
in Kent,' thinks that the spot may still be identified,
on the way between Deal and Dover, where, by this
time, a considerable British force was once more
gathered. So entirely was the whole country on the
patriot side, that no suspicion of all this reached the
Romans, and still less did they dream that the
unreaped corn-field was an elaborate trap, and that
the woodlands beside it were filled, or ready for
filling, by masses of the enemy. The Seventh legion,
which was that day on duty, sent out a strong fatigue
party to seize the prize; who, on reaching the field,
grounded shields and spears, took off, probably, their
helmets and tunics, and set to work at cutting down
the corn, presumably with their swords.</p>

<p>D. 10.&mdash;Not long afterwards the camp guard reported
to Caesar that a strange cloud of dust was
rising beyond the ridge over which the legion had
disappeared. Seeing at once that something was
amiss, he hastily bade the two cohorts (about a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page99" id="page99">[99]</a></span>
thousand men) of the guard to set off with him
instantly, while the other legion, the Tenth, was to
relieve them, and follow with all the rest of their
force as speedily as possible. Pushing on with all
celerity, he soon could tell by the shouts of his
soldiers and the yells of the enemy that his men
were hard pressed; and, on crowning the ridge, saw
the remnant of the legion huddled together in a half-armed
mass, with the British chariots sweeping round
them, each chariot-crew<a name="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> as it came up springing down
to deliver a destructive volley of missiles, then on
board and away to replenish their magazine and
charge in once more.</p>

<p>D. 11.&mdash;Even at this moment Caesar found time to
note and admire the supreme skill which the enemy
showed in this, to him, novel mode of fighting. Their
driving was like that of the best field artillery of
our day; no ground could stop them; up and down
slopes, between and over obstacles, they kept their
horses absolutely in hand; and, out of sheer bravado,
would now and again exhibit such feats of trick-driving
as to run along the pole, and stand on the
yoke, while at full speed. Such skill, as he truly
observed, could not have been acquired without
constant drill, both of men and horses; and his
military genius grasped at once the immense advantages
given by these tactics, combining &quot;the mobility
of cavalry with the stability of infantry.&quot;</p>

<p>D. 12.&mdash;We may notice that Caesar says not a word
<span class="newpage"><a name="page100" id="page100">[100]</a></span>
of the scythe-blades with which popular imagination
pictures the wheels of the British chariots to have
been armed. Such devices were in use amongst the
Persians, and figure at Cunaxa and Arbela. But
there the chariots were themselves projectiles, as it
were, to break the hostile ranks; and even for this
purpose the scythes proved quite ineffective, while
they must have made the whole equipment exceedingly
unhandy. In the 'De Re Militari' (an illustrated
treatise of the 5th century A.D. annexed to the
'Notitia') scythed chariots are shown. But the scythes
always have chains attached, to pull them up out of
the way in ordinary manoeuvres. The Britons of this
date, whose chariots were only to bring their crews up
to the foe and carry them off again, had, we may be
sure, no such cumbrous and awkward arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p>D. 13.&mdash;On this scene of wild onset Caesar arrived
in the nick of time [<i>tempore opportunissimo</i>]. The
Seventh, surprised and demoralized, were on the
point of breaking, when his appearance on the ridge
caused the assailants to draw back. The Tenth came
up and formed; their comrades, possibly regaining
some of their arms, rallied behind them, and the
Britons did not venture to press their advantage home.
But neither did Caesar feel in any case to retaliate the
attack [<i>alienum esse tempus arbitratus</i>], and led his
troops back with all convenient speed. The Britons,
we may well believe, represented the affair as a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page101" id="page101">[101]</a></span>
glorious victory for the patriot arms.<a name="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> They employed
several days of bad weather which followed in spreading
the tidings, and calling on all lovers of freedom
or of spoil to join in one great effort for crushing the
presumptuous invader.</p>

<p>D. 14.&mdash;The news spread like wild-fire, and the
Romans found themselves threatened in their very
camp (whence they had taken care not to stir since
their check) by a mighty host both of horse and
footmen. Caesar was compelled to fight, the legions
were drawn up with their backs to the rampart, that
the hostile cavalry might not take them in rear, and,
after a long hand-to-hand struggle, the Roman charge
once more proved irresistible. The Britons turned
their backs and fled; this time cut up, in their
retreat, by a small body of thirty Gallic horsemen
whom Commius had brought over as his escort, and
who had shared his captivity and release. So weak a
force could, of course, inflict no serious loss upon the
enemy, but, before returning to the camp, they made
a destructive raid through the neighbouring farms and
villages, &quot;wasting all with fire and sword far and
wide.&quot;</p>

<p>D. 15.&mdash;That same day came fresh envoys to treat
for peace. They were now required to furnish twice
as many hostages as before; but Caesar could not
wait to receive them. They must be sent after him
to the Continent. His position had become utterly
<span class="newpage"><a name="page102" id="page102">[102]</a></span>
untenable; the equinoctial gales might any day
begin; and he was only too glad to find wind and
weather serve that very night for his re-embarkation.
Under cover of the darkness he huddled his troops on
board; and next morning the triumphant Britons beheld
the invaders' fleet far on their flight across the Narrow
Seas.</p>

<br />
<p>E. 1.&mdash;Caesar too had, on his side, gained what he
wanted, though at a risk quite disproportionate to the
advantage. So much prestige had he lost that on his
disembarkation his force was set upon by the very
Gauls whom he had so signally beaten two years
before. Their attack was crushed with little difficulty
and great slaughter; but that it should have
been made at all shows that he was supposed to be
returning as a beaten man. However, he now knew
enough about Britain and the Britons to estimate
what force would be needful for a real invasion, and
energetically set to work to prepare it. To make
such an invasion, and to succeed in it, had now
become absolutely necessary for his whole future.
At any cost the events of the year 55 must be
&quot;wiped off the slate;&quot; the more so as, out of all
the British clans, two only sent in their promised
hostages. Caesar's dispatches home, we may be sure,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page103" id="page103">[103]</a></span>
were admirably written, and so represented matters
as to gain him a <i>supplicatio</i>, or solemn thanksgiving,
of twenty days from the Senate. But the
unpleasant truth was sure to leak out unless it was
overlaid by something better. It did indeed so far
leak out that Lucan<a name="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> was able to write: <i>Territa

&quot;He sought the Britons; then, in panic dread,<br />
Turned his brave back, and from his victory fled.&quot;<br /></div>

<p>E. 2.&mdash;Before setting off, therefore, for his usual
winter visit to Rome, he set all his legionaries to work
in their winter quarters, at building ships ready to
carry out his plans next spring. He himself furnished
the drawings, after a design of his own, like our own
Alfred a thousand years later.<a name="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> They were to be of
somewhat lower free-board than was customary, and
of broader beam, for Caesar had noted that the choppy
waves of the Channel had not the long run of
Mediterranean or Atlantic rollers. All, moreover,
were to be provided with sweeps; for he did not
intend again to be at the mercy of the wind. And
with such zeal and skill did the soldiers carry out his
instructions, by aid of the material which he ordered
from the dockyards of Spain, that before the winter
was over they had constructed no fewer than six
hundred of these new vessels, besides eighty fresh
war-galleys.</p>

<p>E. 3.&mdash;Caesar meanwhile was also at his winter's
<span class="newpage"><a name="page104" id="page104">[104]</a></span>
work amid the turmoil of Roman politics. His &quot;westward
ho!&quot; movement was causing all the stir he hoped
for. We can see in Cicero's correspondence with
Atticus, with Trebatius, and with his own brother
Quintus (who was attached in some capacity to
Caesar's second expedition), how full Rome was of
gossip and surmise as to the outcome of this daring
adventure. &quot;Take care,&quot; he says to Trebatius, &quot;you
who are always preaching caution; mind you don't
get caught by the British chariot-men.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> &quot;You will
find, I hear, absolutely nothing in Britain&mdash;no gold,
no silver. I advise you to capture a chariot and drive
straight home. Anyhow get yourself into Caesar's good
books.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p>E. 4.&mdash;To be in Caesar's good books was, in fact,
Cicero's own great ambition at this time. Despite
his constitutional zeal, he felt &quot;the Dynasts,&quot; as he
called the Triumvirate, the only really strong force in
politics, and was ready to go to considerable lengths
in courting their favour&mdash;Caesar's in particular. He
not only withdrew all opposition to the additional
five years of command in Gaul which the subservient
Senate had unconstitutionally decreed to the &quot;dynast,&quot;
but induced his brother Quintus to volunteer for
service in the coming invasion of Britain. Through
Quintus he invited Caesar's criticisms on his own very
poor verses, and wrote a letter, obviously meant to be
shown, expressing boundless gratification at a favourable
notice: &quot;If <i>he</i> thinks well of my poetry, I shall
know it is no mere one-horse concern, but a real
<span class="newpage"><a name="page105" id="page105">[105]</a></span>
four-in-hand.&quot; &quot;Caesar tells me he never read better
Greek. But why does he write &#8165;&#945;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#8061;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945; [<b>rhathum&ocirc;tera</b>] ['rather
careless'] against one passage? He really does. Do
find out why.&quot;</p>

<p>E. 5.&mdash;This gentle criticism seems to have somewhat
damped Cicero's ardour for Caesar and his
British glories. His every subsequent mention of the
expedition is to belittle it. In the spring he had
written to Trebatius: &quot;So our dear Caesar really thinks
well of you as a counsel. You will be glad indeed to
have gone with him to Britain. There at least you
will never meet your match.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> But in the summer it
is: &quot;I certainly don't blame you for showing yourself
so little of a sight-seer [<i>non nimis</i> &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#952;&#8051;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#957; [<b>philothe&ocirc;ron</b>]]
in this British matter.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> &quot;I am truly glad you never went
there. You have missed the trouble, and I the bore
of listening to your tales about it all.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> To Atticus
he writes: &quot;We are all awaiting the issue of this
British war. We hear the approaches [<i>aditus</i>] of the
island are fortified with stupendous ramparts [<i>mirificis
molibus</i>]. Anyhow we know that not one scruple
[<i>scrupulum</i>] of money exists there, nor any other
plunder except slaves&mdash;and none of them either
literary or artistic.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> &quot;I heard (on Oct. 24) from
Caesar and from my brother Quintus that all is over
in Britain. No booty.... They wrote on September
26, just embarking.&quot;</p>

<p>E. 6.&mdash;Both Caesar and Quintus seem to have been
excellent correspondents, and between them let Cicero
<span class="newpage"><a name="page106" id="page106">[106]</a></span>
hear from Britain almost every week during their stay
in the island, the letters taking on an average about a
month to reach him. He speaks of receiving on
September 27 one written by Caesar on September 1;
and on September 13 one from Quintus (&quot;your
fourth&quot;)<a name="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> written August 10. And apparently they
were very good letters, for which Cicero was duly
grateful. &quot;What pleasant letters,&quot; he says to Quintus,
&quot;you do write.... I see you have an extraordinary
turn for writing (&#8017;&#960;&#8057;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957;) [<b>hypothesin</b>] <i>scribendi egregiam</i>.
Tell me all about it, the places, the people, the customs, the
clans, the fighting. What are they all like? And
what is your general like?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> &quot;Give me Britain,
that I may paint it in your colours with my own
brush [<i>penicillo</i>].&quot;<a name="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> This last sentence refers to a
heroic poem on &quot;The Glories of Caesar,&quot; which Cicero
seems to have meditated but never brought into being.
Nor do we know anything of the contents of his
British correspondence, except that it contains some
speculations about our tide-ways; for, in his 'De
Natura Deorum,'<a name="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> Cicero pooh-poohs the idea that
such natural phenomena argue the existence of a
God: &quot;Quid? Aestus maritimi ... Britannici ...
sine Deo fieri nonne possunt?&quot;</p>

<p>E. 7.&mdash;Neither can we say what he meant by the
&quot;stupendous ramparts&quot; against Caesar's access to our
island. The Dover cliffs have been suggested, and
the Goodwin Sands; but it seems much more probable
that the Britons were believed to have artificially
<span class="newpage"><a name="page107" id="page107">[107]</a></span>
fortified the most accessible landing-places. Perhaps
they may have actually done so, but if they did it was
to no purpose; for this time Caesar disembarked his
army quite unopposed. On his return from Rome he
had bidden his newly-built fleet, along with what was
left of the old one, rendezvous at Boulogne; whence,
after long delay through a continuous north-westerly
breeze [<i>Corus</i>], he was at length enabled to set sail
with no fewer than eight hundred vessels. Never
throughout history has so large a navy threatened our
shores. The most numerous of the Danish expeditions
contained less than four hundred ships, William the
Conqueror's less than seven hundred;<a name="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> the Spanish
Armada not two hundred.</p>

<p>E. 8.&mdash;Caesar was resolved this time to be in sufficient
strength, and no longer despised his enemies.
He brought with him five out of his eight legions, some
thirty thousand infantry, that is, and two thousand
horse. The rest remained under his most trusted
lieutenant, Labienus, to police Gaul and keep open
his communications with Rome. According to Polyaenus<a name="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a>
(A.D. 180), he even brought over with him a
fighting elephant, to terrify the natives and their
horses. There is nothing impossible about the story;
though it is not likely Caesar would have forgotten to
mention so striking a feature of his campaign. One
particular animal we may be sure he had with him, his
own famous charger with the cloven hoof, which had
been bred in his own stud, and would suffer on its
<span class="newpage"><a name="page108" id="page108">[108]</a></span>
back none but himself. On it, as the rumour went, it
had been prophesied by the family seer that he should
ever ride to victory.</p>

<p>E. 9.&mdash;It was, as the Emperor Napoleon has calculated,
on July 21 that, at sun-set this mighty
armament put out before a gentle south-west air,
which died away at midnight, leaving them becalmed
on a waveless sea. When morning dawned Britain
lay on their left, and they were drifting up the straits
with the tide. By and by it turned, oars were got
out, and every vessel made for the spot which the
events of the previous year had shown to be the best
landing-place.<a name="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> Thanks to Caesar's foresight the transports
as well as the galleys could now be thus propelled,
and such was the ardour of the soldiers that both
classes of ships kept pace with one another, in spite
of their different build. The transports, of course,
contained men enough to take turns at the sweeps,
while the galley oarsmen could not be relieved. By
noon they reached Britain, and found not a soul to
resist their landing. There had been, as Caesar learnt
from &quot;prisoners,&quot; a large force gathered for that
purpose, but the terrific multitude of his ships had
proved quite too demoralizing, and the patriot army
had retired to &quot;higher ground,&quot; to which the prisoners
were able to direct the invader.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page109" id="page109">[109]</a></span>
<p>E. 10.&mdash;There is obviously something strange about
this tale. There was no fighting, the shore was
deserted, yet somehow prisoners were taken, and
prisoners singularly well informed as to the defenders'
strategy. The story reads very much as if these
useful individuals were really deserters, or, as the
Britons would call it, traitors. We know that in one
British tribe, at least, there was a pro-Roman party.
Not long before this there had fled to Caesar in Gaul,
Mandubratius, the fugitive prince of the Trinobantes,
who dwelt in Essex. His father Immanuentius had
been slain in battle by Cassivellaunus, or Caswallon<a name="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a>
(the king of their westward neighbours the Cateuchlani),
now the most powerful chieftain in Britain, and
he himself driven into exile.</p>

<p>E. 11.&mdash;This episode seems to have formed part of a
general native rising against the over-sea suzerainty
of Divitiacus, which had brought Caswallon to the
front as the national champion. It was Caswallon
who was now in command against Caesar, and if, as is
very probable, there was any Trinobantian contingent
in his army, they may well have furnished these
&quot;prisoners.&quot; For Caesar had brought Mandubratius
with him for the express purpose of influencing the
Trinobantes, who were in fact thus induced in a few
weeks to set an example of submission to Rome, as
soon as their fear of Caswallon was removed. And
<span class="newpage"><a name="page110" id="page110">[110]</a></span>
meanwhile nothing is more likely than that a certain
number of ardent loyalists should leave the usurper's
ranks and hasten to greet their hereditary sovereign,
so soon as ever he landed. The later British accounts
develop the transaction into an act of wholesale
treachery; Mandubratius (whose name they discover
to mean <i>The Black Traitor</i>) deserting, in the thick of
a fight, to Caesar, at the head of twenty thousand
clansmen,&mdash;an absurd exaggeration which may yet
have the above-mentioned kernel of truth.</p>

<p>E. 12.&mdash;But whoever these &quot;prisoners&quot; were, their
information was so important, and in Caesar's view so
trustworthy, that he proceeded to act upon it that very
night. Before even entrenching his camp, leaving
only ten cohorts and three hundred horse to guard
the vessels, most of which were at anchor on the
smooth sea, he set off at the head of his army &quot;in the
third watch,&quot; and after a forced march of twelve
miles, probably along the British trackway afterwards
called Watling Street, found himself at daybreak in
touch with the enemy. The British forces were
stationed on a ridge of rising ground, at the foot of
which flowed a small stream. Napoleon considers
this stream to have been the Lesser Stour (now a
paltry rivulet, dry in summer, but anciently much
larger), and the hill to have been Barham Down, the
camping-ground of so many armies throughout British
history.</p>

<p>E. 13.&mdash;The battle began with a down-hill charge of
the British cavalry and chariots against the Roman
horse who were sent forward to seize the passage of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page111" id="page111">[111]</a></span>
the stream. Beaten back they retreated to its banks,
which were now, doubtless, lined by their infantry.
And here the real struggle took place. The unhappy
Britons, however, were hopelessly outclassed, and very
probably outnumbered, by Caesar's twenty-four thousand
legionaries and seventeen hundred horsemen.
They gave way, some dispersing in confusion, but the
best of their troops retiring in good order to a stronghold
in the neighbouring woods, &quot;well fortified both
by nature and art,&quot; which was a legacy from some
local quarrel. Now they had strengthened it with an
abattis of felled trees, which was resolutely defended,
while skirmishers in open order harassed the assailants
from the neighbouring forest [<i>rari propugnabant
e silvis</i>]. It was necessary for the Seventh legion to
throw up trenches, and finally to form a &quot;tortoise&quot;
with their shields, as in the assault on a regularly
fortified town, before the position could be carried.
Then, at last, the Britons were driven from the wood,
and cut up in their flight over the open down beyond.
The spot where they made this last stand is still, in
local legend, associated with the vague memory of
some patriot defeat, and known by the name of &quot;Old
England's Hole.&quot; Traces of the rampart, and of the
assailants' trenches, are yet visible.<a name="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>Fleet again wrecked&mdash;Britons rally under Caswallon&mdash;Battle of Barham Down&mdash;Britons fly to<br />
London&mdash;Origin of London&mdash;Patriot army dispersed.</i></p>
<br />
<p>F. 1.&mdash;It was Caesar's intention to give the broken
enemy no chance of rallying. In spite of the dire
fatigue of his men (who had now been without sleep
for two nights, and spent the two succeeding days in
hard rowing and hard fighting), he sent forward the
least exhausted to press the pursuit. But before the
columns thus detailed had got out of sight a message
from the camp at Richborough changed his purpose.
The mishap of the previous year had been repeated.
Once more the gentle breeze had changed to a gale,
and the fleet which he had left so smoothly riding at
anchor was lying battered and broken on the beach.
His own presence was urgently needed on the scene
of the misfortune, and it would have been madness
to let the campaign go on without him. So the pursuers,
horse and foot, were hastily recalled, and,
doubtless, were glad enough to encamp, like their
comrades, on the ground so lately won, where they
took their well-earned repose.</p>

<p>F. 2.&mdash;But for Caesar there could be no rest. Without
the loss of a moment he rode back to the landing-place,
where he found the state of things fully as bad
as had been reported to him. Forty ships were hopelessly
shattered; but by dint of strenuous efforts he
<span class="newpage"><a name="page113" id="page113">[113]</a></span>
succeeded in saving the rest. All were now drawn on
shore, and tinkered up by artificers from the legions,
while instructions were sent over to Labienus for the
building of a fresh fleet in Gaul. The naval station,
too, was this time thoroughly fortified.</p>

<p>F. 3.&mdash;Ten days sufficed for the work; but meanwhile
much of the fruit of the previous victory had
been lost. The Britons, finding the pursuit checked,
and learning the reason, had rallied their scattered
force; and when Caesar returned to his camp at Barham
Down he found before it a larger patriot army
than ever, with Caswallon (who is now named for
the first time) at its head. This hero, who, as we have
said, may have been brought to the front through the
series of inter-tribal wars which had ruined the foreign
supremacy of Divitiacus in Britain, was by this time
acclaimed his successor in a dignity corresponding in
some degree to the mythical Pendragonship of Welsh
legend.<a name="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> His own immediate dominions included at
least the future districts of South Anglia and Essex,
and his banner was followed by something very like a
national levy from the whole of Britain south of the
Forth. When we read of the extraordinary solidarity
which animated, over a much larger area, the equally
separate clans of Gaul in their rising against the
Roman yoke a year later, there is nothing incredible,
or even improbable, in the Britons having developed
something of a like solidarity in their resistance to its
being laid upon their necks. Burmann's 'Anthology'
contains an epigram which bears witness to the existence
<span class="newpage"><a name="page114" id="page114">[114]</a></span>
amongst us even at that date of the sentiment,
&quot;Britons never shall be slaves.&quot; Our island is described
as &quot;<i>Libera non hostem non passa Britannia regem</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p>F. 4.&mdash;Even on his march from the new naval camp
to Barham Down Caesar was harassed by incessant
attacks from flying parties of Caswallon's chariots and
horsemen, who would sweep up, deliver their blow,
and retire, only to take grim advantage of the slightest
imprudence on the part of the Roman cavalry in
pursuit. And when, with a perceptible number of
casualties, the Down was reached, a stronger attack
was delivered on the outposts set to guard the
working parties who were entrenching the position,
and the fighting became very sharp indeed. The
outposts were driven in, even though reinforced by
two cohorts&mdash;each the First of its Legion, and thus
consisting of picked men, like the old Grenadier
companies of our own regiments. Though these twelve
hundred regulars, the very flower of the Roman army,
awaited the attack in such a formation that the front
cohort was closely supported by the rear, the Britons
pushed their assault home, and had &quot;the extreme
audacity&quot; to charge clean through the ranks of both,
re-form behind, and charge back again, with great loss
to the Romans (whose leader, Quintus Labienus
Durus, the Tribune, or Divisional General in command
of one of the legions, was slain), and but little
<span class="newpage"><a name="page115" id="page115">[115]</a></span>
to themselves. Not till several more cohorts were
dispatched to the rescue did they at length retire.</p>

<p>F. 5.&mdash;This brilliant little affair speaks well both for
the discipline and the spirit of the patriot army; and
Caesar ungrudgingly recognizes both. He points out
how far superior the British warriors were to his own
men, both in individual and tactical mobility. The
legionaries dare not break their ranks to pursue,
under pain of being cut off by their nimble enemies
before they could re-form; and even the cavalry found
it no safe matter to press British chariots too far or
too closely. At any moment the crews might spring
to earth, and the pursuing horsemen find themselves
confronted, or even surrounded, by infantry in
position. Moreover, the morale of the British army
was so good that it could fight in quite small units,
each of which, by the skilful dispositions of Caswallon,
was within easy reach of one of his series of &quot;stations&quot;
(<i>i.e.</i> block-houses) disposed along the line of march,
where it could rest while the garrison turned out to
take its turn in the combat.</p>

<p>F. 6.&mdash;Against such an enemy it was obviously
Caesar's interest to bring on, as speedily as possible, a
general action, in which he might deliver a crushing
blow. And, happily for him, their success had rendered
the Britons over-confident, so that they were
even deluded enough to imagine that they could face
the full Roman force in open field. Both sides,
therefore, were eager to bring about the same result.
Next morning the small British squads which were
hovering around showed ostentatious reluctance to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page116" id="page116">[116]</a></span>
come to close quarters, so as to draw the Romans out
of their lines. Caesar gladly met their views, and
sent forward all his cavalry and three legions, who, on
their part, ostentatiously broke rank and began to
forage. This was the opportunity the Britons wanted&mdash;and
Caesar wanted also. From every side, in front,
flank, and rear, the former &quot;flew upon&quot; their enemies,
so suddenly and so vigorously that ere the legions,
prepared as they were for the onset, could form, the
very standards were all but taken.</p>

<p>F. 7.&mdash;But this time it was with legions and not
with cohorts that the enemy had to do. Their first
desperate charge spent itself before doing any serious
damage to the masses of disciplined valour confronting
them, and the Romans, once in formation, were
able to deliver a counter-charge which proved quite
irresistible. On every side the Britons broke and
fled; the main stream of fugitives unwisely keeping
together, so that the pursuers, cavalry and infantry
alike, were able to press the pursuit vigorously. No
chance was given for a rally; amid the confusion the
chariot-crews could not even spring to earth as usual;
and the slaughter was such as to daunt the stoutest
patriot. The spell of Caswallon's luck was broken,
and his auxiliaries from other clans with one accord
deserted him and dispersed homewards. Never again
throughout all history did the Britons gather a national
levy against Rome.</p>

<p>F. 8.&mdash;This break-up of the patriot confederacy
seems, however, to have been not merely the spontaneous
disintegration of a routed army, but a deliberately
<span class="newpage"><a name="page117" id="page117">[117]</a></span>
adopted resolution of the chiefs. Caesar
speaks of &quot;their counsel.&quot; And this brings us to an
interesting consideration. Where did they take this
counsel, and why did the fleeing hosts follow one line
of flight? And how was the line of the Roman
advance so accurately calculated upon by Caswallon
that he was able to place his &quot;stations&quot; along it
beforehand? The answer is that there was an obvious
objective for which the Romans would be sure to
make; indeed there was almost certainly an obvious
track along which they would be sure to march.
There is every reason to believe that most of the later
Roman roads were originally British trackways, broad
green ribands of turf winding through the land (such
as the Icknield Way is still in many parts of its
course), and following the lines most convenient for
trade.</p>

<p>F. 9.&mdash;But, if this is so, then that convergence of
these lines on London, which is as marked a feature
of the map of Roman Britain as it is of our railway
maps now, must have already been noticeable. And
the only possible reason for this must be found in the
fact that already London was a noted passage over the
Thames. That an island in mid-stream was the
original <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of London Bridge is apparent
from the mass of buildings which is shown in every
ancient picture of that structure clustering between
the two central spans. This island must have been a
very striking feature in primaeval days, coming, as it
did, miles below any other eyot on the river, and
must always have suggested and furnished a comparatively
<span class="newpage"><a name="page118" id="page118">[118]</a></span>
easy crossing-place. Possibly even a bridge of
some sort may have existed in 54 B.C.; anyhow this
crossing would have been alike the objective of the
invading, and the <i>point d'appui</i> of the defending
army. And the line both of the Roman advance and
of the British retreat would be along the track
afterwards known as the Kentish Watling Street. For
here again the late British legends which tell us of
councils of war held in London against Caesar, and
fatal resolutions adopted there, with every detail of
proposer and discussion, are probably founded, with
gross exaggeration, upon a real kernel of historic
truth. It was actually on London that the Britons
retired, and from London that the gathering of the
clans broke up, each to its own.</p>

<br />
<p>G. 1.&mdash;Caswallon, however, and his immediate realm
still remained to be dealt with. His first act, on resolving
upon continued resistance, would of course be to
make the passage of the London tide-way impossible
for the Roman army; and Caesar, like William the
Conqueror after him, had to search up-stream for a
crossing-place. He did not, however, like William,
have to make his way so far as Wallingford before
finding one. Deserters told him of a ford, though a
difficult one, practicable for infantry, not many miles
<span class="newpage"><a name="page119" id="page119">[119]</a></span>
distant. The traditional spot, near Walton-on-Thames,
anciently called Coway Stakes, may very probably be
the real place. Both name and stakes, however, have
probably, in spite of the guesses of antiquaries, no
connection with Caesar and his passage, but more
prosaically indicate that here was a passage for cattle
(Coway = Cow Way) marked out by crossing stakes.</p>

<p>G. 2.&mdash;The forces of Caswallon were accompanying
the Roman march on the northern bank of the stream,
and when Caesar came to the ford he found them
already in position [<i>instructas</i>] to dispute his passage
behind a <i>chevaux de frise</i> of sharpened stakes, more
of which, he was told, were concealed by the water.
If the Britons had shown their wonted resolution this
position must have been impregnable. But Caswallon's
men were disheartened and shaken by the
slaughter on the Kentish Downs and the desertion of
their allies. Caesar rightly calculated that a bold
demonstration would complete their demoralization.
So it proved. The sight of the Roman cavalry
plunging into the steam, and the legionaries eagerly
pressing on neck-deep in water, proved altogether too
much for their nerves. With one accord, and without
a blow, they broke and fled.<a name="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p>G. 3.&mdash;Nor did Caswallon think it wise again to
gather them. He had no further hope of facing
Caesar in pitched battle, and contented himself with
keeping in touch with the enemy with a flying column
of chariot-men some two thousand strong. His practice
<span class="newpage"><a name="page120" id="page120">[120]</a></span>
was to keep his men a little off the road&mdash;there
was still, be it noted, a <i>road</i> along which the Romans
were marching&mdash;and drive off the flocks and herds
into the woods before the Roman advance. He made
no attempt to attack the legions, but if any foragers
were bold enough to follow up the booty thus reft
from them, he was upon them in a moment. Such
serious loss was thus inflicted that Caesar had to
forbid any such excursions, and to content himself
with laying waste the fields and farms in immediate
proximity to his route.</p>

<p>G. 4.&mdash;He was now in Caswallon's own country,
and his presence there encouraged the Trinobantian
loyalists openly to throw off allegiance to their
conqueror and raise Mandubratius to his father's throne
under the protection of Rome; sending to Caesar at
the same time provisions for his men, and forty
hostages whom he demanded of them. Caesar in
return gave strict orders to his soldiers against
plundering or raiding in their territory. This mingled
firmness and clemency made so favourable an impression
that the submission of the Trinobantes was
followed by that of various adjoining clans, small and
great, from the Iceni of East Anglia to the little riverside
septs of the Bibroci and Ancalites, whose names
may or may not be echoed in the modern Bray and
Henley. The Cassi (of Cassiobury) not only submitted,
but guided the Romans to Caswallon's own
neighbouring stronghold in the forests near St. Alban's.
It was found to be a position of considerable natural
strength (probably on the site of the later Verulam),
<span class="newpage"><a name="page121" id="page121">[121]</a></span>
and well fortified; but all the heart was out of the
Cateuchlanians. When the assailing columns approached
to storm the place on two sides at once,
they hesitated, broke, and flung themselves over the
ramparts on the other sides in headlong flight. Caesar,
however, was able to head them, and his troops killed
and captured large numbers, besides getting possession
of all the flocks and herds, which, as usual, had been
gathered for refuge within the stockade.</p>

<p>G. 5.&mdash;Caswallon himself, however, escaped, and
now made one last bid for victory. So great was still
the influence of his prestige that, broken as he was,
he was able to prevail upon the clans of Kent to
make a sudden and desperate onset upon the Naval
Station at Richborough. All four of the chieftains
beneath whose sway the county was divided (Cingetorix,
Canilius, Taximagulus, and Segonax) rose with
one accord at his summons. The attack, however,
proved a mere flash in the pan. Even before it was
delivered, the garrison sallied out vigorously, captured
one of the British leaders, Lugotorix, slaughtered the
assailants wholesale, and crushed the whole movement
without the loss of a man. This final defeat of his
last hopes broke even Caswallon's sturdy heart. His
followers slain, his lands wasted, his allies in revolt,
he bowed to the inevitable. Even now, however, he
did not surrender unconditionally, but besought
Caesar's <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, the Atrebatian chieftain Commius,
to negotiate terms with the conqueror.</p>

<p>G. 6.&mdash;To Caesar this was no small relief. The
autumn was coming on, and Caswallon's guerrilla
<span class="newpage"><a name="page122" id="page122">[122]</a></span>
warfare might easily eat up all the remainder of the
summer, when he must needs be left alone, conquered
or unconquered, that the Roman army might get
back to its winter quarters on the Continent; more
especially as ominous signs in Gaul already predicted
the fearful tempest of revolt which, that winter, was
to burst. Easy conditions were therefore imposed.
Caswallon pledged himself, as Lord Paramount, that
Britain should pay an annual tribute to the Roman
treasury, and, as Chief of the Cateuchlani, that he
would leave Mandubratius on the Trinobantian
throne. Hostages were given, and the Roman forces
returned with all convenient speed to the coast; this
time, presumably, crossing the Thames in the regular
way at London.</p>

<p>G. 7.&mdash;After a short wait, in vain expectation of
the sixty ships which Labienus had built in Gaul and
which could not beat across the Channel, Caesar
crowded his troops and the hordes of British captives
on board as best he could, and being favoured by the
weather, found himself and them safe across, having
worked out his great purpose, and leaving a nominally
conquered and tributary Britain behind him. This,
as we have seen from Cicero's letter, was on September
26, B.C. 54.</p>

<p>G. 8.&mdash;We have seen, too, that Cicero's cue was to
belittle the business. But this was far from being
the view taken by the Roman &quot;in the street.&quot; To
him Caesar's exploit was like those of the gods and
heroes of old; Hercules and Bacchus had done less,
for neither had passed the Ocean. The popular
<span class="newpage"><a name="page123" id="page123">[123]</a></span>
feeling of exultation in this new glory added to Roman
fame may be summed up in the words of the
Anthologist already quoted:</p>

<blockquote><p>Libera non hostem, non passa Britannia regem,<br />
  Aeternum nostro quae procul orbe jacet;<br />
Felix adversis, et sorte oppressa secunda,<br />
  Communis nobis et tibi Caesar erit.<br />
<br />
[&quot;Free Britain, neither foe nor king that bears,<br />
That from our world lies far and far away,<br />
Lucky to lose, crushed by a happy doom,<br />
Henceforth, O Caesar, ours&mdash;and yours&mdash;will be.&quot;]</p></blockquote>

<p>G. 9.&mdash;Caesar never set foot in Britain again, though
he once saved himself from imminent destruction by
utilizing his British experiences and passing his
troops over a river in coracles of British build.<a name="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> He
went his way to the desperate fighting, first of the
great Gallic revolt, then of the Civil War (with his
own Labienus for the most ferocious of his opponents),
till he found himself the undisputed master of the
Roman world. But when he fell, upon the Ides of
March B.C. 44, it was mainly through the superhuman
reputation won by his invasion of Britain that he
received the hitherto unheard of distinction of a
popular apotheosis, and handed down to his successors
for many a generation the title not only of
Caesar, but of &quot;Divus.&quot;</p>

<br />
<p>A. 1.&mdash;With the departure of Caesar from its shores
our knowledge of the affairs of Britain becomes only
less fragmentary than before he reached them. We do
not even learn how far the tribute he had imposed
continued to be paid. Most probably during the confusion
of the Gallic revolt and the Civil Wars it ceased
altogether. In that confusion Commius finally lost
his continental principality of Arras, and had to fly
for his life into his British dominions. He only saved
himself, indeed, by an ingenious stratagem. When he
reached the shore of Gaul he found his ship aground
in the tide-way. Nevertheless, by hoisting all sail, he
deceived the pursuing Romans into thinking themselves
too late till the rising tide permitted him really
<span class="newpage"><a name="page125" id="page125">[125]</a></span>
to put to sea.<a name="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> The effect of the extinction of Atrebatian
power in Gaul was doubtless to consolidate it
in Britain, as when our English sovereigns lost their
hold on Normandy and Anjou, for we find that Commius
reigned at least over the eastern counties of
Wessex, and transmitted his power to his sons, Verica,
Eppillus, and Tincommius, who seem to have shared
the kingdom between them. Tincommius, however,
may possibly be, as Professor Rhys suggests, merely a
title, signifying the <i>Tanist</i> (or Heir) of Commius. In
this case it would be that of Verica, who was king
after his father.<a name="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p>A. 2.&mdash;The evidence for this is that in the district
mentioned British coins are found bearing these
names. For now appears the first inscribed British
coinage; the inscriptions being all in Latin, a sign of
the abiding influence of the work of Caesar. And it is
by that light mainly that we know the little we do
know of British history for the next century. The
coins are very numerous, and preserve for us the
names of no fewer than thirty several rulers (or states).
They are mostly of gold (though both silver and
bronze also occur), and are found over the greater
part of the island, the southern and the eastern
counties being the richest. The inscriptions indicate,
as has already been mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> a state of great
political confusion throughout the country. But they
<span class="newpage"><a name="page126" id="page126">[126]</a></span>
also bear testimony not only to the dynasty of Commius,
but to the rise of a much stronger power north
of the Thames.</p>

<p>A. 3.&mdash;That power was the House of Cunobelin, or
Cinobellinus<a name="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> (Shakespeare's Cymbeline), who figures
in the pages of Suetonius as King of all Britain, insomuch
that his fugitive son, Adminius, posed before
Caligula as the rightful sovereign of the whole island.
His coins were undoubtedly current everywhere south
of Trent and east of Severn, if not beyond those rivers.
They are found in large numbers, and of most varied
devices, all showing the influence of classical art. A
head (probably his own portrait) is often on the obverse,
and on the reverse Apollo playing the lyre, or a
Centaur, or a Victory, or Medusa, or Pegasus, or
Hercules. Other types show a warrior on horse or
foot, or a lion,<a name="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> or a bull, or a wolf, or a wild boar;
others again a vine-leaf, or an ear of bearded wheat.
On a very few is found the horse, surviving from the
old Macedonian mintage.<a name="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> And all bear his own name,
sometimes in full, CVNOBELINVS REX, oftener abbreviated
in various ways.</p>

<p>A. 4.&mdash;But the coins do more than testify to the
widespread power of Cymbeline himself. They show
<span class="newpage"><a name="page127" id="page127">[127]</a></span>
us that he inherited much of it from his father. This
prince, whose name was Tasciovan, is often associated
with his son in the inscriptions, and the son is often
described as TASCIIOVANI F. (<i>Filius</i>) or TASCIOVANTIS.
There are besides a large number of coins belonging
to Tasciovan alone. And these tell us where he
reigned. They are struck (where the mint is recorded)
either at Segontium<a name="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> or at Verulam. The latter is
pretty certainly the town which had sprung up on the
site of Caswallon's stronghold, so that we may reasonably
conclude that Tasciovan was the successor of the
patriot hero on the Cateuchlanian throne&mdash;very probably
his son. But Cymbeline's coins are struck at
the <i>Trinobantian</i> capital, Camelodune,<a name="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> which we
know to have been the royal city of his son Caratac
(or Caradoc) at the Claudian conquest.</p>

<p>A. 5.&mdash;It would seem, therefore, that, Caesar's mandate
to the contrary notwithstanding, Caswallon's clan,
who were now called (perhaps from his name),
Cattivellauni, had again conquered the Trinobantes,
deposing, and probably slaying, Mandubratius.<a name="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> This
would be under Tasciovan, who gave the land to his
son Cymbeline, and, at a later date, must have subdued
the Atrebatian power in the south. The sons of
Commius were, as is shown by Sir John Evans,
contemporary with Tasciovan. But, by and by, we find
Epaticcus, <i>his</i> son, and Adminius, apparently his
grandson, reigning in their realm, the latter taking
Kent, the former the western districts. The previous
<span class="newpage"><a name="page128" id="page128">[128]</a></span>
Kentish monarch was named Dumnovellanus, and
appears as DAMNO BELLA on the Ancyran Tablet.
This wonderful record of the glories of Augustus
mentions, <i>inter alia</i>, that certain British kings, of
whom this prince was one, fled to his protection.
The tablet is, unhappily, mutilated at the point where
their names occur, but that of another begins with
TIM&mdash;probably, as Sir John Evans suggests, Tin-Commius.
Adminius also was afterwards exiled by his
own father, Cymbeline, and in like manner appealed
to Caesar&mdash;Caligula&mdash;in 40 A.D.</p>

<p>A. 6.&mdash;Nothing came of either appeal. Augustus
did indeed, according to Dio Cassius, meditate completing
his &quot;father's&quot; work, and (in B.C. 34) entered
Gaul with a view to invading Britain. But the political
troubles which were to culminate at Actium called him
back, and he contented himself with laying a small
duty on the trade between Britain and Gaul. Tin, as
before, formed the staple export of our island, and
other metals seem now to have been added&mdash;iron
from Sussex and lead from Somerset. Doubtless also
the pearls from our native oysters (of which Caesar
had already dedicated a breastplate to his ancestral
Venus) found their way to Rome, though of far less
value than the Oriental jewel, being of a less pure
white.<a name="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> Besides these we read of &quot;ivory bracelets and
necklets, amber and glass ornaments, and such-like
rubbish,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> which doubtless found a sale amongst the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page129" id="page129">[129]</a></span>
<i>virtuosi</i> of Rome, as like products of savage industry
from Africa or Polynesia find a sale amongst our
<i>virtuosi</i> nowadays. Meanwhile, Roman dignity was
saved by considering these duties to be in lieu of the
unpaid tribute imposed by Caesar, and the island was
declared by courtly writers to be already in practical
subjection. &quot;Some of the chiefs (&#948;&#965;&#957;&#8049;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;) [<b>dunastai</b>] have
gained the friendship of Augustus, and dedicated
offerings in the Capitol.... The island would not
be worth holding, and could never pay the expenses
of a garrison.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p>A. 7.&mdash;At the same time the Romans of the day
evidently took a very special interest in everything
connected with Britain. The leaders of Roman
society, like Maecenas, drove about in British chariots,<a name="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a>
smart ladies dyed their hair red in imitation of British
warriors,<a name="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> tapestry inwoven with British figures was
all the fashion,<a name="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> and constant hopes were expressed
by the poets that, before long, so interesting a land
might be finally incorporated in the Roman Empire.<a name="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p>A. 8.&mdash;Augustus was too prudent to be stirred up
by this &quot;forward&quot; policy; which, indeed, he had
<span class="newpage"><a name="page130" id="page130">[130]</a></span>
sanctioned once too often in the fatal invasion of
Germany by Varus. But the diseased brain of
Caligula <i>was</i> for a moment fired with the ambition of
so vast an enterprise. He professed that the fugitive
Adminius had ceded to him the kingship of the whole
island, and sent home high-flown dispatches to that
effect. He had no fleet, but drew up his army in line
of battle on the Gallic shore, while all wondered what
mad freak he was purposing; then suddenly bade
every man fill his helmet with shells as &quot;spoils of the
Ocean&quot; to be dedicated in the Capitol. Finally he
commemorated this glorious victory by the erection
of a lofty lighthouse,<a name="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> probably at the entrance of
Boulogne harbour.</p>

<p>A. 9.&mdash;It was clear, however, that sooner or later
Britain must be drawn into the great system so near
her, and the next reign furnished the needful occasion.
Yet another exiled British pretender appealed to the
Emperor to see him righted&mdash;this time one Vericus.
His name suggests that he may have been Verica son
of Commius; but the theory of Professor Rhys and
Sir John Evans seems more probable&mdash;that he was a
Prince of the Iceni. The earliest name found on the
coins of that clan is Addeomarus (Aedd Mawr, or
Eth the Great, of British legend), who was contemporary
with Tasciovan. After this the tribe probably
became subject to Cymbeline, at whose death<a name="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> the
chieftainship seems to have been disputed between
<span class="newpage"><a name="page131" id="page131">[131]</a></span>
two pretenders, Vericus and Antedrigus; and on the
success of the latter (presumably by Cateuchlanian
favour) the former fled to Rome. Claudius, who now
sat on the Imperial throne, eagerly seized the opportunity
for the renown he was always coveting, and in
A.D. 44 set in motion the forces of the Empire to
subdue our island.</p>

<br />
<p>B. 1.&mdash;The command of the expedition was entrusted
to Aulus Plautius Laelianus, a distinguished Senator,
of Consular rank. But the reluctance of the soldiery to
advance &quot;beyond the limits of this mortal world&quot;
(&#7952;&#958;&#969; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#959;&#8054;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#951;&#962;) [<i>ex&ocirc; tas ohikoumen&ecirc;s</i>], and entrust themselves
to the mysterious tides of the ocean which was held to
bound it, caused him weeks of delay on the shores
of Gaul. Nor could anything move them, till they
found this malingering likely to expose them to the
degradation of a quasi-imperial scolding from Narcissus,
the freed-man favourite of Claudius, who came
down express from Rome as the Emperor's mouthpiece.<a name="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a>
To bear reproof from one who had been
born a slave was too much for Roman soldiers. When
Narcissus mounted the tribune to address them in
the Emperor's name, his very first words were at once
<span class="newpage"><a name="page132" id="page132">[132]</a></span>
drowned by a derisive shout from every mouth of &quot;<i>Io
Saturnalia</i>!&quot; the well-known cry with which Roman
slaves inaugurated their annual Yule-tide licence of
aping for the day the characters of their masters.
The parade tumultuously broke off, and the troops
hurried down to the beach to carry out the commands
of their General&mdash;who was at least free-born.</p>

<p>B, 2.&mdash;The passage of the Channel was effected in
three separate fleets, possibly at three separate points,
and the landing on our shores was unopposed. The
Britons, doubtless, had been lulled to security by the
tidings of the mutinous temper in the camp of the
invaders, and were quite unprepared for the very
unexpected result of the mission of Narcissus. It
seems likely, moreover, that the disembarkation was
made much further to the west than they would have
looked for. The voyage is spoken of as long, and
amid its discomforts the drooping spirits of the
soldiery were signally cheered by a meteor of special
brilliance which one night darted westwards as their
harbinger. Moreover we find that when the Romans
did land, their first success was a defeat of the
Dobuni, subject allies of the House of Cymbeline,
who, as we gather from Ptolemy, dwelt in what is
now Southern Gloucestershire.<a name="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> This objective rather
<span class="newpage"><a name="page133" id="page133">[133]</a></span>
points to their landing-place having been in Portsmouth
harbour<a name="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> (<i>the</i> Port, as its name still reminds
us, of Roman Britain), where the undoubtedly Roman
site of Portchester may well mark the exact spot where
the expedition first set foot on shore.</p>

<p>B. 3.&mdash;Besides an unknown force of Gallic auxiliaries,
its strength comprised four veteran legions, one (the
Ninth <i>Hispanica</i>)<a name="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> from the Danube frontier, the rest
(Twentieth, Fourteenth, and Second) from the Rhine.
This last, an &quot;Augustan&quot;<a name="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> legion, was commanded by
the future Emperor Vespasian&mdash;a connection destined
to have an important influence on the <i>pronunciamento</i>
which, twenty-five years later, placed him on the throne.<a name="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a>
As yet he was only a man of low family, whom
favouritism was held to have hurried up the ladder of
promotion more rapidly than his birth warranted.<a name="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a>
Serving under him as Military Tribunes were his
brother Sabinus and his son Titus; and in this
British campaign all three Flavii are said to have
distinguished themselves,<a name="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> especially at the passage of
an unnamed river, where the Britons made an obstinate
stand. The ford was not passed till after three days'
continuous fighting, of which the issue was finally
<span class="newpage"><a name="page134" id="page134">[134]</a></span>
decided by the &quot;Celtic&quot; auxiliaries swimming the
stream higher up, and stampeding the chariot-horses
tethered behind the British lines.</p>

<p>B. 4.&mdash;What this stream may have been is a
puzzle.<a name="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> Dion Cassius brings it in after a victory over
the sons of Cymbeline, Caradoc (or Caractacus, as
historians commonly call him) and Togodumnus,
wherein the latter was slain. And he adds that
from its banks the Britons fell back upon their next
line of defence, the <i>tide-way</i> on the Thames. He
tells us that, though tidal, the river was, at this
point, fordable at low water for those who knew the
shallows; and incidentally mentions that at no great
distance there was even a bridge over it. But it
was bordered by almost impassable<a name="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> swamps. It must
be remembered that before the canalizing of the
Thames the influence of the tide was perceptible at
least as high as Staines, where was also a crossing-place
of immemorial antiquity. And hereabouts may very
probably have been the key of the British position, a
position so strong that it brought Plautius altogether
to a standstill. Not till overwhelming reinforcements,
including even an elephant corps, were summoned
from Rome, with Claudius in person at their head,
was a passage forced. The defence then, however,
collapsed utterly, and within a fortnight of his landing,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page135" id="page135">[135]</a></span>
Claudius was able to re-embark for Rome, after

<br />
<p>C. 1.&mdash;The success thus achieved was evidently
felt to be something quite exceptionally brilliant and
important. Not once, as was usual, but four several
times was Claudius acclaimed &quot;Imperator&quot;<a name="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> even
before he left our shores; and in after years these
acclamations were renewed at Rome as often as good
news of the British war arrived there, till, ere
Claudius died, he had received no fewer than twenty-one
such distinctions, each signalized by an issue of
commemorative coinage. His &quot;Britannic triumph&quot; was
celebrated on a scale of exceptional magnificence.
In addition to the usual display, he gave his people
the unique spectacle of their Emperor climbing the
ascent to the Capitol not in his triumphal car, nor
even on foot, but on his knees (as pilgrims yet mount
the steps of the Ara Coeli), in token of special
<span class="newpage"><a name="page136" id="page136">[136]</a></span>
gratitude to the gods for so signal an extension of the
glory and the Empire of Rome. In the gladiatorial
shows which followed, he presided in full uniform
[<i>paludatus</i>],<a name="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> with his son (whose name, like his own,
a <i>Senatus consultum</i> had declared to be <i>Britannicus</i>)<a name="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a>
on his knee.<a name="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> One of the spectacles represented the
storm of a British <i>oppidum</i> and the surrender of
British kings. The kings were probably real British
chieftains, and the storm was certainly real, with real
Britons, real blood, real slaughter, for Claudius went
to every length in this direction.</p>

<p>C. 2.&mdash;The narrative of Suetonius<a name="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> connects these
shows with the well-known tale of the unhappy
gladiators who fondly hoped that a kind word from
the Emperor meant a reprieve of their doom. He
had determined to surpass all his predecessors in his
exhibition of a sea-fight, and had provided a sheet of
water large enough for the manoeuvres of real war-galleys,
carrying some five hundred men apiece.<a name="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a>
The crews, eleven thousand in all, made their usual
preliminary march past his throne, with the usual
mournful acclaim, &quot;<i>Ave Caesar! Salutant te morituri</i>!&quot;
Claudius responded, &quot;<i>Aut non</i>:&quot; and these
two words were enough to inspire the doomed ranks
with hopes of mercy. With one accord they refused
to play their part, and he had to come down in
person and solemnly assure them that if his show was
spoilt he would exterminate every man of them &quot;with
<span class="newpage"><a name="page137" id="page137">[137]</a></span>
fire and sword,&quot; before they would embark. Once
entered upon the combat, however, they fought
desperately; so well, indeed, that at its close the
survivors were declared exempt from any further
performance. Such was the fate which awaited those
who dared to defend their freedom against the Fortune
of Rome, and such the death died by many a brave
Briton for the glory of his subjugators. Dion Cassius<a name="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a>
tells us that Aulus Plautius made a special boast of
the numbers so butchered in connection with his own
&quot;Ovation.&quot;</p>

<p>C. 3.&mdash;This ceremony was celebrated A.D. 47, two
years after that of Claudius. Plautius had remained
behind in Britain to stamp out the last embers of
resistance,&mdash;a task which all but proved fatal to
Vespasian, who got hemmed in by the enemy. He
was only saved by the personal heroism and devotion
of Titus, who valiantly made in to his father's rescue,
and succeeded in cutting him out. This seems to
have been in the last desperate stand made by the
Britons during this campaign. After this, with
Togodumnus slain, Caradoc probably a fugitive in hiding,
and the best and bravest of the land slaughtered
either in the field or in the circus at Rome, British
resistance was for the moment utterly crushed out.
Claudius continued his demonstrations of delight;
when Plautius neared Rome he went out in person to
meet him,<a name="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> raised him when he bent the knee in
homage, and warmly shook hands with him<a name="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> (&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#967;&#949;&#8055;&#963;&#945;&#962;) [<b>kalos

Sacra.<a name="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p>C. 4.&mdash;Rewards were at the same time showered
on the inferior officers. Cnaeus Ostorius Geta, the
hero of the first riverside fight in Britain, was allowed
to triumph in consular fashion, though not yet of
consular rank; and an inscription found at Turin
speaks of collars, gauntlets and phalera bestowed on
one Caius Gavius, along with a golden wreath for
Distinguished Service. Another, found in Switzerland,<a name="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a>
records the like wreath assigned to Julius
Camillus, a Military Tribune of the Fourth Legion,
together with the decoration of the <i>Hasta Pura</i>
(something, it would seem, in the nature of the
Victoria Cross); which was also, according to
Suetonius,<a name="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> given to Posides, one of the Emperor's
favourite freedmen.</p>

<p>C. 5.&mdash;To Claudius himself, besides his triumph, the
Senate voted two triumphal arches,<a name="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> one in Rome, the
other in the Gallic port whence he had embarked for
Britain. Part of the inscription on the former of
these was found in 1650 on the site where it stood
(near the Palazzo Sciarra), and is still to be seen in
the gardens of the Barberini Palace. It runs as
follows (the conjectural restoration of the lost
portions which have been added being enclosed in
brackets):</p>

<p>Claudius also affixed to the walls of
the imperial house on the Palatine (which was destined
to give the name of &quot;palace&quot; to royal abodes for all
time),<a name="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> a &quot;<i>corona navalis</i>&quot;&mdash;a circlet in which the

</div>
<p>C. 6.&mdash;As usual, coins were struck to commemorate
the occasion, the earliest of the long series of Roman
coins relating to Britain. They bear on the obverse
<span class="newpage"><a name="page140" id="page140">[140]</a></span>
the laureated head of Claudius to the right, with the
superscription TI. CLAVD. CAESAR. AVG. P.M. TR. P.
VIIII. IMP. XVI. On the reverse is an equestrian figure,
between two trophies, surmounting a triumphal arch,
over which is inscribed the legend DE. BRITAN. This
coin, being of gold, was struck not by the Senate (who
regulated the bronze issue), but by the Imperial mint,
and dates from the year 46, when Claudius was clothed
for the ninth time with the authority of Tribune. By
that time the arch was doubtless completed, and the
coin may well show what it was actually like. Another
coin, also bearing the words DE. BRITAN., shows
Claudius in his triumphal chariot with an eagle on his
sceptre. Even poor little Britannicus, who never
came to his father's throne, being set aside through
the intrigues of his stepmother Agrippina and finally
poisoned (A.D. 55) by Nero, had a coin of his own on
this occasion issued by the Senate and inscribed TI.
CLAVD. CAESAR. AVG. F. [<i>Augusti Filius</i>] BRITANNICVS.</p>

<p>C.7.&mdash;Seneca, whose own connection with Britain
was that of a grinding usurer,<a name="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> speaks with intense
disgust of the conciliatory attitude of Claudius towards
the populations, or more probably the kinglets, who
had submitted to his sway. He purposed, it seems,
even to see some of them raised to Roman citizenship
[<i>Britannos togatos videre</i>]. That the grateful
provincials should have raised a temple to him at
Camelodune, and rendered him worship as an incarnate
deity, adds to the offence. And, writing on the
Emperor's death, the philosopher points with evident
<span class="newpage"><a name="page141" id="page141">[141]</a></span>
satisfaction to the wretched fate of the man who
triumphed over Britain and the Ocean, only to fall at
last a victim to the machinations of his own wife.</p>

<p>C. 8.&mdash;An interesting confirmation of this information
as to the relations between Claudius and his
British subjects is to be found in a marble tablet<a name="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a>
discovered at Chichester, which commemorates the
erection of a temple (dedicated to Neptune and
Minerva) for the welfare of the Divine [<i>i.e.</i> Imperial]
Household by a Guild of Craftsmen [<i>collegium fabrorum</i>]
on a site given by Pudens the son of Pudentinus;<a name="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a>
all under the authority of Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus,
at once a native British kinglet and Imperial
Legate in Britain. This office would imply Roman
citizenship, as would also the form of his name.
That (doubtless on his enfranchisement) he should
have been allowed to take such a distinguished <i>nomen</i>
and <i>praenomen</i> as Tiberius Claudius marks the special
favour in which he was held by the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> To
this witness is also borne by Tacitus, who says that
<span class="newpage"><a name="page142" id="page142">[142]</a></span>
certain states in Britain were placed under Cogidubnus
not as a tributary Kingdom but as a Roman Province.
Hence his title of Imperial Legate. These states
were doubtless those of the Cantii and Regni in Kent,
Surrey and Sussex.</p>
<br />

<p>C. 9.&mdash;The Iceni, on the other hand, were subject
allies of Rome, with Vericus, in all probability, on the
throne.<a name="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> The Atrebates would seem also to have
been &quot;friendlies.&quot; But the great mass of the British
clans were chafing under the humiliation and suffering
which the invaders had wrought for them, and evidently
needed a strong hand to keep them down. Under
the Empire provinces requiring military occupation
were committed not to Pro-consuls chosen by the
Senate, but to Pro-praetors nominated by the Emperor,
and were called &quot;Imperial&quot; as opposed to &quot;Senatorial&quot;
governments.<a name="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> Britain was now accordingly declared
an Imperial Province, and Ostorius Scapula sent by
Claudius to administer it as Pro-praetor.</p>
<br />

at Rome&mdash;Death of Ostorius&mdash;Uriconium and Caerleon&mdash;Britain quieted&mdash;Death of Claudius.</i></p>
<br />
<p>D. 1.&mdash;When Ostorius, in A.D. 50, reached Britain
he found things in a very disturbed state. The clans
<span class="newpage"><a name="page143" id="page143">[143]</a></span>
which had submitted to the Romans were being raided
by their independent neighbours, who calculated that
this new governor would not venture on risking his
untried levies in a winter campaign against them.
Ostorius, however, was astute enough to realize that
such a first impression of his rule would be fatal, and,
by a sudden dash with a flying column (<i>citas cohortes</i>),
cut the raiders to pieces. As usual the Britons hoisted
the white flag in their familiar manner, making a
surrender which they had no intention whatever of
keeping to longer than suited their plans; and they
were proportionately disgusted when Ostorius set to
work at a real pacification of the Midlands, constructing
forts at strategic points along the Trent and
Severn, and requiring all natives whatsoever within
this Roman Pale to give up their arms.</p>

<p>D. 2.&mdash;This demand the Britons looked upon as
an intolerable dishonour, even as it seemed to the
Highlanders two centuries ago. The first to resent
it were the chieftain and clan whose alliance with Rome
had been the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the Conquest, Vericus
and his Iceni.<a name="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> Was this brand of shame to be their
reward for bringing in the invaders? They received
the mandate of Ostorius with a burst of defiance, and
hastily organized a league of the neighbouring tribes
to resist so intolerable a degradation. Before their
allies could come in, however, Ostorius was upon
them, and it became a matter of defending their own
borders.</p>

<p>D. 3.&mdash;The spot they selected for resistance was a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page144" id="page144">[144]</a></span>
space shut in by earthworks <i>(agresti aggere)</i> accessible
only by one narrow entrance. This description exactly
applies to the locality where we should look for
an Icenian Thermopylae. The clan dwelt, as we have
said, in East Anglia, their borders to the south
being the marshy course of the Stour, running
from the primaeval forest that capped the &quot;East
Anglian Heights,&quot; and, to the west, the Cambridgeshire
Fens. They thus lived within a ring fence almost
unassailable. Only in one spot was there an entrance.
Between the Fen and the Forest stretched a narrow
strip of open turf, some three or four miles across,
affording easy marching. And along it ran their own
great war-path, the Icknield Street, extending from the
heart of their realm right away to the Thames at
Goring. It never became a Roman road, though
a few miles are now metalled. Along most of its
course it remains what it was in British days, a broad,
green track seamed with scores of rut-marks. And
even where it has been obliterated, its course may be
traced by the names of Ickborough in Norfolk, Iclingham
in Suffolk, Ickleton in Cambridgeshire, and
Ickleford in Hertfordshire.<a name="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p>D. 4.&mdash;The Iceni had long ago taken care to fortify
this approach to their land. The whole space between
fen and forest in the Cam valley was cut across by
four (or five) great dykes which may still be traced,
constructed for defence against invaders from the
westward. Of these, the two innermost are far more
formidable than the rest, the &quot;Fleam Dyke&quot; near
<span class="newpage"><a name="page145" id="page145">[145]</a></span>
Cambridge, and the &quot;Devil's Ditch&quot; by Newmarket.
The outer fosse of each is from twenty to thirty feet
deep; and the rampart, when topped by a stockade,
must have constituted an obstacle to troops unprovided
with artillery which the Iceni might justifiably
think insuperable. The &quot;one narrow entrance&quot; along
the whole length of the dykes (five miles and ten
miles respectively) is where the Icknield Way cuts
through them.</p>

<p>D. 5.&mdash;Here then, probably, the Icenian levies confidently
awaited the onslaught of Ostorius&mdash;the more
confidently inasmuch as he had not waited to call up
his legionaries from their winter quarters, but attacked
only with the irregulars whom he had been employing
against the marauders in the midlands. The Iceni,
doubtless, imagined that such troops would be unequal
to assaulting their dyke at all. But Ostorius
was no ordinary leader. Such was the enthusiasm
which he inspired in his troops that they surprised the
revolters by attacking along the whole line of the
Fleam Dyke at once, and that with such impetuosity
that in a moment they were over it. The hapless
Iceni were now caught in a death-trap. Behind them
the Devil's Ditch barred all retreat save through its
one narrow entrance, and those who failed to force
their way through the mad crush there could only
fight and die with the courage of despair. &quot;Many a
deed of desperate valour did they,&quot; says Tacitus
[<i>multa et clara facinora</i>], and the Romans displayed
like courage; the son of Ostorius winning in the fray
<span class="newpage"><a name="page146" id="page146">[146]</a></span>
the &quot;civic crown&quot;<a name="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> awarded for the rescue of a
Roman citizen. But no quarter seems to have been
given, and the flower of the Icenian tribe perished
there to a man.</p>

<p>D. 6.&mdash;This slaughter effectually scotched the
rising which the Icenians were hoping to organize.
All Central Britain submitted, and, we may presume,
was quietly disarmed; though the work cannot have
been very effectually done, as these same tribes were
able to rise under Boadicea twelve years later. The
indefatigable Ostorius next led his men against the
Cangi in North Wales<a name="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> (who seem to have been
stirred to revolt by the Icenian Prince Antedrigus),
and gained much booty, for the Britons dared not
venture upon a battle, and had no luck in their various
attempts at surprise. But before he quite reached the
Irish Sea he was recalled by a disturbance amongst
the Brigantes, which by a judicious mixture of firmness
and clemency he speedily suppressed. And all this
he did without employing a single legionary.</p>

<p>D. 7.&mdash;But neither firmness nor clemency availed to
put an end to the desperate struggle for freedom
maintained by the one clan in Britain which still held
out against the Roman yoke. The Silurians of South
Wales were not to be subdued without a regular campaign
<span class="newpage"><a name="page147" id="page147">[147]</a></span>
which was to tax the Legions themselves to the
utmost. Naturally brave, stubborn, and with a passionate
love of liberty, they had at this juncture a
worthy leader, for Caradoc was at their head. We
hear nothing of his doings between the first battle
against Aulus Plautius, when his brother Togodumnus
fell, leaving him the sole heir of Cymbeline, until we
find him here. But we may be pretty sure that he
was the animating spirit of the resistance which so
long checked the conquerors on the banks of the
Thames, and that he took no part in the general submission
to Claudius. Probably he led an outlaw life
in the forest, stirring up all possible resistance to the
Roman arms, till finally he found himself left with this
one clan of all his father's subjects still remaining
faithful.</p>

<p>D. 8.&mdash;But he never thought of surrender. He was
everywhere amongst his followers, says Tacitus, exhorting
them to resist to the death, reminding them
how Caswallon had &quot;driven out&quot; the great Julius, and
binding one and all by a solemn national covenant
[<i>gentili religione</i>] never to yield &quot;either for wound or
weapon.&quot; Ostorius had to bring against him the
whole force he could muster, even calling out the
veterans newly settled at the Colony<a name="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> of Camelodune.
Caradoc and his Silurians, on their part, did not wait
at home for the attack, but moved northwards into
the territory of the Ordovices, who at least sympathized
<span class="newpage"><a name="page148" id="page148">[148]</a></span>
if they did not actually aid. Here he entrenched himself
upon a mountain, very probably that Caer Caradoc,
near Shrewsbury, which still bears his name. Those
who know the ground will not wonder that Ostorius
hesitated at assaulting so impregnable a position. His
men, however, were eager for the attack. &quot;Nothing,&quot;
they cried, &quot;is impregnable to the brave.&quot; The legionaries
stormed the hill on one side, the auxiliaries on
the other; and once hand to hand, the mail-clad
Romans had a fearful advantage against defenders
who wore no defensive armour, nor even helmets.
The Britons broke and fled, Caradoc himself seeking
refuge amongst the Brigantes of the north.</p>

<p>D. 9.&mdash;At this time the chief power in this tribe
was in the hands of a woman, Cartismandua, the
heiress to the throne, with whose name and that of
her Prince Consort scandal was already busy. The
disturbances amongst the clan which Ostorius had
lately suppressed were probably connected with her
intrigues. Anyhow she posed as the favourite and
friend of the Romans; and now showed her loyalty
by arresting the national hero and handing him over
to the enemy. With his family and fellow-captives
he was [A.D. 52] deported to Rome, and publicly
exhibited by the Emperor in his chains, as the last
of the Britons, while the Praetorian Guards stood to
their arms as he passed.</p>

<p>D. 10.&mdash;According to Roman precedent the scene
should have closed with a massacre of the prisoners.
But while the executioners awaited the order to strike,
Caradoc stepped forward with a spirited appeal, the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page149" id="page149">[149]</a></span>
substance of which there is every reason to believe is
truthfully recorded by Tacitus. Disdaining to make
the usual pitiful petitions for mercy, he boldly justified
his struggle for his land and crown, and reminded
Claudius that he had now an exceptional opportunity
for winning renown. &quot;Kill me, as all expect, and
this affair will soon be forgotten; spare me, and men
will talk of your clemency from age to age.&quot; Claudius
was touched; and even the fierce Agrippina, who,
to the scandal of old Roman sentiment, was seated
beside him at the saluting-point &quot;as if she had been
herself a General,&quot; and who must have reminded
Caradoc of Cartismandua, was moved to mercy. Caradoc
was spared, and assigned a residence in Italy;
and the Senate, believing the war at an end with his
capture, voted to Ostorius &quot;triumphal insignia&quot;<a name="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a>&mdash;the
highest honour attainable by any Roman below
Imperial rank.<a name="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>

<p>D. 11.&mdash;But even without their King the stubborn
clan still stood desperately at bay. Their pertinacious
resistance in every pass and on every hill-top of their
country at length fairly wore Ostorius out. The
incessant fatigues of the campaign broke down his
health, and he died [A.D. 54] on the march; to the
ferocious joy of the Silurians, who boasted that their
valour had made an end of the brave enemy who had
vowed to &quot;extinguish their very name,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> no less than
if they had slain him upon the field of battle.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page150" id="page150">[150]</a></span>
<p>D. 12.&mdash;Before he died, however, he had curbed
them both to north and south by the establishment
of strong Roman towns at Uriconium on the Severn
(named after the neighbouring Wrekin), and Isca
Silurum at the mouth of the Usk. The British name
of the latter place, Caerleon [Castra Legionum], still
reminds us that it was one of the great legionary

<p>D. 13.&mdash;The unremitting pressure of these two
garrisons crushed out at last the Silurian resistance.
The fighting men of the clan must indeed have been
almost wholly killed off during these four years of
murderous warfare. Thus Avitus Didius Gallus, the
successor of Ostorius, though himself too old to take
the field, was able to announce to Claudius that he
had completed the subjugation of Britain. The
Silurians after one last effort, in which they signally
defeated an entire Legion, lay in the quietude of utter
exhaustion; and though Cartismandua caused some
little trouble by putting away her husband Venusius
and raising a favourite to the throne, the matter was
compromised by Roman intervention; and Claudius
lived to hear that the island was, at last, peacefully
submissive to his sway. Then Agrippina showed
herself once more the Cartismandua of Rome, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page151" id="page151">[151]</a></span>
her son Nero sat upon the throne of her poisoned
husband [A.D. 55].</p>

<p>E. 1.&mdash;Under Nero the unhappy Britons first
realized what it was to be Roman provincials. Though
Julius Caesar and Augustus had checked the grossest
abuses of the Republican proconsulates, yet enough
of the evil tradition remained to make those abuses
flourish with renewed vigour under such a ruler as
Nero. The state of things which ensued can only be
paralleled with that so vividly described by Macaulay
in his lurid picture of the oppression of Bengal under
Warren Hastings. The one object of every provincial
governor was to exploit his province in his own
pecuniary interest and that of his friends at Rome.
Requisitions and taxes were heaped on the miserable
inhabitants utterly beyond their means, with the
express object of forcing them into the clutches of the
Roman money-lenders, whose frightful terms were, in
turn, enforced by military licence.</p>

<p>E. 2.&mdash;The most virtuous and enlightened citizens
were not ashamed thus to wring exorbitant interest
from their victims. Cicero tells us<a name="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> how no less
austere a patriot than Brutus thus exacted from the
town of Salamis in Cyprus, 48 per cent. compound
interest, and, after starving five members of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page152" id="page152">[152]</a></span>
municipality to death in default of payment, was mortally
offended because he, Cicero, as proconsul, would not
exercise further military pressure for his ends.</p>

<p>E. 3.&mdash;The part thus played in Cyprus by Brutus
was played in Britain by Seneca, another of the choice
examples of the highest Roman virtue. By a series
of blood-sucking transactions<a name="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> he drove the
Britons to absolute despair, his special victim being
Prasutagus, now Chief of the Iceni, presumably set up by
the Romans on the suppression of the revolt under
Vericus. As a last chance of saving any of his wealth
for his children, Prasutagus, by will, made the
Emperor his co-heir. This, however, only hastened
the ruin of his family. His property was pounced
upon by the harpies of Seneca and Nero, with the
Procurator<a name="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> of the Province, Catus Decimus,
at their head, his kin sold into slavery, his daughters
outraged, and his wife Boadicea, or, more correctly,
<i>Boudicca</i>, brutally scourged. This was in A.D. 61.</p>

<p>E. 4.&mdash;A convulsive outburst of popular rage and
despair followed. The wrongs of Boadicea kindled
the Britons to madness, and she found herself at once
at the head of a rising comprising all the clans of the
east and the Midlands. Half-armed as they were,
their desperate onset carried all before it. The first
attack was made upon the hated Colony at Camelodune,
where the great Temple of &quot;the God&quot; Claudius,
rising high above the town, bore an ever-visible testimony
<span class="newpage"><a name="page153" id="page153">[153]</a></span>
to Rome's enslavement of Britain,<a name="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> and whence
the lately-established veterans were wont, by the connivance
of the Procurator, to treat the neighbourhood
with utterly illegal military licence, sacking houses,
ravaging fields, and abusing their British fellow-subjects
as &quot;caitiff slaves.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p>E. 5.&mdash;These marauders were, however, as great
cowards as bullies, and were now trembling before the
approach of vengeance. How completely they were
cowed is shown by the gloomy auguries which passed
from lip to lip as foreshadowing the coming woe. The
statue of Victory had fallen on its face, women
frantic with fear rushed about wildly shrieking
&quot;Ruin!&quot;, strange moans and wailings were heard
in Courthouse and Theatre, on the Thames estuary
the ruddy glow of sunset looked like blood and
flame, the sand-ripples and sea-wrack left by the ebb
suggested corpses; everything ministered to their
craven fear.</p>

<p>E. 6.&mdash;So hopeless was the demoralization that the
very commonest precautions were neglected. The town
was unfortified, yet these old soldiers made no
attempt at entrenchment; even the women and children
were not sent away while the roads were yet open.
And when the storm burst on the town the hapless
non-combatants were simply abandoned to massacre,
while the veterans, along with some two hundred
badly-armed recruits (the only help furnished by their
precious Procurator, who himself fled incontinently
<span class="newpage"><a name="page154" id="page154">[154]</a></span>
to Gaul), shut themselves up in the Temple, in
hopes of thus saving their own skins till the Ninth
Legion, which was hastening to their aid, should
arrive.</p>

<p>E. 7.&mdash;It is a satisfaction to read that in this they
were disappointed. Next day their refuge was stormed,
and every soul within put to the sword. The Temple
itself, and all else at Camelodune, was burnt to the
ground, and the wicked Colony blotted off the face of
the earth. The approaching Legion scarcely fared
better. The victorious Britons swept down upon it on
the march, cut to pieces the entire infantry, and sent
the cavalry in headlong flight to London, where
Suetonius Paulinus, the Governor of Britain, was now
mustering such force as he could make to meet the
overwhelming onslaught.</p>

<p>E. 8.&mdash;When the outbreak took place he had been
far away, putting down the last relics of the now
illicit Druidism in the island of Mona or Anglesey.
The enterprise was one which demanded a considerable
display of force, for the defenders of the island
fought with fanatical frenzy, the priests and priestesses
alike taking part in the fray, and perishing at last in
their own sacrificial fires, when the passage over the
Menai Straits was made good.</p>

<p>E. 9&mdash;It is noticeable that in Mona alone do we
meet with &quot;Druidesses.&quot; Female ministers of religion,
whether priestesses or prophetesses, are always
exceptional, and usually mark a survival from some
very primitive cult. The Pythoness at Delphi, and
the Vestals at Rome, obviously do so. And amongst
<span class="newpage"><a name="page155" id="page155">[155]</a></span>
the races of Gaul and Britain the same fact is
testified to by such female ministrations being invariably
confined to far western islands. Pytheas, as he
passed Cape Finisterre (in Spain) by night, heard a
choir of women worshipping &quot;Mother Earth and her
Daughter&quot;<a name="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> with shrill yells and music. A little
further he tells of the barbarous rites observed by the
<i>Samnitae</i> or <i>Amnitae</i><a name="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> in an island near the mouth of
the Loire, on which no male person might ever set
foot; and of another island at the extreme point of
Gaul, already known as Uxisana (Ushant), where
nine virgin sorceresses kept alight the undying fire
on their sacred hearth and gave oracular responses.
These cults clearly represented a much older worship
than Druidism, though the latter may very probably
have taken them under its shadow (as in India
so many aboriginal rites are recognized and adopted
by modern Brahmanism). And the priestesses in
Mona were, in like manner, not &quot;Druidesses&quot; at all,
but representatives of some more primitive cult,
already driven from the mainland of Britain and
finding a last foothold in this remote island.</p>

<p>E. 10.&mdash;The stamping out of the desperate fanaticism
of Mona was barely accomplished, when tidings
<span class="newpage"><a name="page156" id="page156">[156]</a></span>
were brought to Suetonius of Boadicea's revolt.
By forced marches he reached London before her,
only to find himself too weak, after the loss of the
Ninth Legion, to hold it. London, though no Colony,
was already the largest and most thriving of the
Roman settlements in Britain, and piteous was the
dismay of the citizens when Suetonius bade the city
be evacuated. But neither tears nor prayers could
postpone his march, and such non-combatants as
from age or infirmity could not retire with his column,
were massacred by the furious Britons even as those
at Camelodune. Next came the turn of Verulam,
the Roman town on the site of Tasciovan's stronghold,<a name="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a>
where like atrocities marked the British triumph.
Every other consideration was lost in the mad lust of
slaughter. No prisoners were taken, no spoil was
made, no ransom was accepted; all was fire, sword,
and hideous torturing. Tacitus declares that, to his
own knowledge,<a name="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> no fewer than seventy thousand
Romans and pro-Romans thus perished in this fearful
day of vengeance; the spirit of which has been
caught by Tennyson, with such true poetic genius,
in his 'Boadicea.'</p>

<p>E. 11.&mdash;Suetonius, however, now felt strong enough
to risk a battle. The odds were enormous, for the
British forces were estimated at two hundred and
thirty thousand, while his own were barely ten
thousand&mdash;only one legion (the Fourteenth) with the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page157" id="page157">[157]</a></span>
cavalry of the Twentieth. (Where its infantry was
does not appear: it may have been left behind in
the west.) The Ninth had ceased to exist, and
the Second did not arrive from far-off Caerleon till
too late for the fight. The strength of legionary
sentiment is shown by the fact that its commander
actually slew himself for vexation that the Fourteenth
had won without his men.</p>

<p>E. 12.&mdash;Where the armies met is quite uncertain,
though tradition fixes on a not unlikely spot near
London, whose name of &quot;Battle Bridge&quot; has but
lately been overlaid by the modern designation of
&quot;King's Cross.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> We only know that Suetonius
drew up his line across a glade in the forest, which
thus protected his flanks, and awaited the foe as they
came pouring back from Verulam. In front of the
British line Boadicea, arrayed in the Icenian tartan,
her plaid fastened by a golden brooch, and a spear in
her hand, was seen passing along &quot;loftily-charioted&quot;
from clan to clan, as she exhorted each in turn to
conquer or die. Suetonius is said to have given the
like exhortation to the Romans; but every man in
their ranks must already have been well aware that
defeat would spell death for him. The one chance
was in steadiness and disciplined valour; and the
legionaries stood firm under a storm of missiles, withholding
their own fire till the foe came within close
range. Then, and not till then, they delivered a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page158" id="page158">[158]</a></span>
simultaneous discharge of their terrible <i>pila</i><a name="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> on the
British centre. The front gave with the volley, and
the Romans, at once wheeling into wedge-shape
formation, charged sword in hand into the gap, and
cut the British line clean in two. Behind it was a
laager of wagons, containing their families and spoil,
and there the Britons made a last attempt to rally.
But the furious Romans entered the enclosure with
them, and the fight became a simple massacre. No
fewer than eighty thousand fell, and the very horses
and oxen were slaughtered by the maddened soldiery
to swell the heaps of slain. Boadicea, broken-hearted,
died by poison; and (being reinforced by troops from
Germany) Suetonius proceeded &quot;to make a desert
and call it Peace.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<p>E. 13.&mdash;The punishment he dealt out to the revolted
districts was so remorseless that the new Procurator,
Julius Classicianus, sent a formal complaint to Rome
on the suicidal impolicy of his superior's measures.
Nero, however, did not mend matters by sending
(like Claudius) a freed-man favourite as Royal
Commissioner to supersede Suetonius. Polycletus was
received with derision both by Roman and Briton,
and Suetonius remained acting Governor till the wreck
of some warships afforded an excuse for a peremptory
order to &quot;hand over the command&quot; to Petronius
Turpilianus. Fighting now ceased by mutual consent;
and this disgraceful slackness was called by the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page159" id="page159">[159]</a></span>
new Governor &quot;Peace with Honour&quot; [<i>honestum pacis

<br />
<p>F. 1.&mdash;Disgraceful as the policy of Petronius seemed
to Tacitus (under the inspiration probably of his
father-in-law Agricola), it did actually secure for
Britain several years of much-needed peace. Not
till the months of confusion which followed the death
of Nero [June 10, A.D. 68] did any native rising
take place, and then only in Wales and the north.
The Roman Army of Britain was thus free to take
sides in the contest for the throne between Otho and
Vitellius, of which all that could be predicted was
that the victor would be the worse of the two
[<i>deteriorem fore quisquis vicisset</i>]. They were, however,
so much ahead of their date that, before accepting
this alternative, they actually thought of setting
up an Emperor of their own, after the fashion so
freely followed in later centuries. Fortunately the
popular subaltern (&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#8049;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#962;) [<b>hupostrat&ecirc;gos</b>] on whom their choice
fell, one Priscus, had the sense to see that the time
was not yet come for such action, and sarcastically
refused the crown. &quot;I am no more fit,&quot; he said,
&quot;to be an Emperor (&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#8049;&#964;&#969;&#961;) [<b>autokrator</b>] than you to be
<span class="newpage"><a name="page160" id="page160">[160]</a></span>
soldiers.&quot; The army now proceeded to &quot;sit on the
fence&quot;; some legions, notably the famous Fourteenth,
slightly inclined to Otho, others to Vitellius, till
their hesitation was ended by their own special hero,
Vespasian, fresh from his Judaean victories,<a name="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> coming
forward as Pretender. Agricola, now in command
of the Twentieth, at once declared for him, and the
other legions followed suit&mdash;the Fourteenth being
gratified by the title &quot;<i>Victores Britannici</i>,&quot; officially
conferred upon them by the Emperor's new Pro-praetor,
Petilius Cerealis.</p>

<p>F. 2.&mdash;We now enter upon the last stage of the fifty
years' struggle made by British patriots before they
finally bowed to the Roman yoke. The glory of
ending the long conflict is due to Agricola, whose
praises are chronicled by his son-in-law Tacitus, and
who does actually seem to have been a very choice
example of Roman virtue and ability. The Army of
Britain had been his training school in military life,
and successive commanders had recognized his merits
by promotion. Now his superiors gave him an almost
independent command, in which he showed himself
as modest as he was able. Thanks to him, Cerealis
was able in A.D. 70 to end a Brigantian war (of which
the inevitable Cartismandua was the &quot;<i>teterrima causa</i>&quot;
<span class="newpage"><a name="page161" id="page161">[161]</a></span>
now no less than twenty years earlier), and the next
Pro-praetor, Frontinus, to put down, in 75, the very last
effort of the indomitable Silurians. Yet another year,
and he himself was made Military Governor of the
island, and set about the task of permanently consolidating
it as a Roman Province, with an insight all his own.</p>

<p>F. 3.&mdash;The only Britons yet in arms south of the
Tyne were the Ordovices of North Wales, who had
lately cut to pieces a troop of Roman cavalry.
Agricola marched against them, and, by swimming
his horsemen across the Menai Straits, surprised their
stronghold, Anglesey, thus bringing about the same
instant submission of the whole clan which through
the same tactics he had seen won, seventeen years
earlier, by Suetonius.</p>

<p>F. 4.&mdash;But Agricola was not, like Suetonius,
a mere military conqueror. He saw that Britons
would never unfeignedly submit so long as they were
treated as slaves; and he set himself to remedy the
grievances under which the provincials so long had
suffered. Military licence, therefore, and civil
corruption alike, he put down with a resolute hand, never
acting through intermediaries, but himself investigating
every complaint, rewarding merit, and punishing
offences. The vexatious monopolies which previous
governors had granted, he did away with; and, while
he firmly dealt with every symptom of disloyalty, his
aim was &quot;not penalty but penitence&quot; [<i>nom paena sed
saepius paenitentia</i>]&mdash;penitence shown in a frank
acceptance of Roman civilization. Under his influence
<span class="newpage"><a name="page162" id="page162">[162]</a></span>
Roman temples, Roman forums, Roman dwelling-houses,
Roman baths and porticoes, rose all over
the land, and, above all, Roman schools, where the
youth of the upper classes learnt with pride to adopt
the tongue<a name="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> and dress of their conquerors. It is
appropriate that the only inscription relating to him
as yet found in Britain should be on two of the lead
water-pipes (discovered in 1899 and 1902) which
supplied his new Roman city (<i>Deva</i>) at Chester.<a name="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a></p>

<p>F. 5.&mdash;This proved a far more effectual method of
conquest than any yet adopted, and Southern Britain
became so quiet and contented that Agricola could
meditate an extension of the Roman sway over the
wilder regions to the north, and even over Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a>
He did not, indeed, actually accomplish either design,
but he extended the Roman frontier to the Forth, and
carried the Roman arms beyond the Tay. The
game, however, proved not worth the candle. The
regions penetrated were wild and barren, the inhabitants
ferocious savages, who defended themselves with
such fury that it was not worth while to subdue them.</p>
<br />

<p>F. 6.&mdash;The final battle [A.D. 84], somewhere near
Inverness, is described in minute and picturesque
<span class="newpage"><a name="page163" id="page163">[163]</a></span>
detail by Tacitus, who was present. He shows us
the slopes of the Grampians alive with the Highland
host, some on foot, some in chariots, armed with
claymore, dirk, and targe as in later ages. He puts
into the mouth of the leader, Galgacus, an eloquent
summary of the motives which did really actuate
them, and he reports the exhortation to close the
fifty years of British warfare with a glorious victory
which Agricola, no doubt, actually addressed to his
soldiers. He paints for us the wild charge of the
clans, the varying fortunes of the conflict (which at
one point was so doubtful that Agricola dismounted
to fight on foot with his men), and the final hopeless
rout of the Caledonian army, with the slaughter of
ten thousand men; the Roman loss being under four
hundred&mdash;including one unlucky colonel [<i>praefectus
cohortis</i>] whose horse ran away with him into the
enemy's ranks.</p>

<p>F. 7.&mdash;Agricola had now the prudence to draw his
stakes while the game was still in his favour. He
sent his fleet north-about (thus, for the first time,
<i>proving</i> Britain to be an island),<a name="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> and marched his
army across to meet it on the Clyde, whence he
had already drawn his famous rampart to the Forth,
henceforward to be the extreme limit of Roman
Britain.<a name="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> His work was now done, and well done.
He resigned his Province, and returned to Rome, in
time to avoid dismissal by Domitian, to whom
<span class="newpage"><a name="page164" id="page164">[164]</a></span>
preeminent merit in any subject was matter for jealous
hatred,<a name="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> and who now made Agricola report himself
by night, and received him without one word of
commendation. Had his life been prolonged he
would undoubtedly have perished, like so many of
the best of the Roman aristocracy, by the despot's
hands; but just before the unrestrained outbreak of
tyranny, he suddenly died&mdash;&quot;<i>felix opportunitate
mortis</i>&quot;&mdash;to be immortalized by the love and genius
of his daughter's husband. And he left Britain, as it
had never been before, truly within the comity of the
Roman Empire.</p>

<p><i>Pacification of Britain&mdash;Roman roads&mdash;London their centre&mdash;Authority for names&mdash;Watling<br />
Street&mdash;Ermine Street&mdash;Icknield Way.</i></p>
<br />
<p>A. 1.&mdash;The work of Agricola inaugurated in Britain
that wonderful <i>Pax Romana</i> which is so unique a
phenomenon in the history of the world. That
Peace was not indeed in our island so long continued
or so unbroken as in the Mediterranean lands, where,
for centuries on end, no weapon was used in anger.
But even here swords were beaten into ploughshares
and spears into pruning-hooks to an extent never
known before or since in our annals. So profound
was the quiet that for a whole generation Britain
vanishes from history altogether. All through the
Golden Age of Rome, the reigns of Nerva and
Trajan, no writer even names her; and not till A.D.
120 do we find so much as a passing mention of our
country. But we may be sure that under such rulers
the good work of Agricola was developing itself upon
the lines he had laid down, and that Roman civilization
<span class="newpage"><a name="page166" id="page166">[166]</a></span>
was getting an ever firmer hold. The population
was recovering from the frightful drain of the Conquest,
the waste cities were rebuilt, and new towns
sprang up all over the land, for the most part probably
on old British sites, connected by a network of roads,
no longer the mere trackways of the Britons, but
&quot;streets&quot; elaborately constructed and metalled.</p>

<p>A. 2.&mdash;All are familiar with the Roman roads of
Britain as they figure on our maps. Like our present
lines of railway, the main routes radiate in all directions
from London, and for a like reason; London
having been, in Roman days as now, the great commercial
centre of the country. The reason for this,
that it was the lowest place where the Thames could
be bridged, we have already referred to.<a name="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a>
We see the <i>Watling Street</i> roughly corresponding to
the North-Western Railway on one side of the metropolis,
and to the South-Eastern on the other; the <i>Ermine
Street</i> corresponding to the Great Northern Railway;
while the Great Western, the South-Western, the
Great Eastern, and the Portsmouth branch of the
South Coast system are all represented in like manner.
We notice, perhaps, that, except the Watling Street
and the Ermine Street, all these routes are nameless;
though we find four minor roads with names crossing
England from north-east to south-west, and one from
north-west to south-east. The former are the <i>Fosse
Way</i> (from Grimsby on the Humber to Seaton on the
Axe), the <i>Ryknield Street</i> (from Newcastle-on-Tyne
to Caerleon-upon-Usk), the <i>Akeman Street</i> (from Wells
<span class="newpage"><a name="page167" id="page167">[167]</a></span>
on the Wash to Aust on the Severn), and the <i>Icknield
Way</i> (from Norfolk to Dorset). The latter is the <i>Via
Devana</i> (from Chester to Colchester).</p>

<p>A. 3.&mdash;It comes as a surprise to most when we learn
that all these names (except the Watling Street, the
Fosse, and the Icknield Way only) are merely affixed
to their respective roads by the conjectures of
17th-century antiquarianism, Gale being their special
identifier. The names themselves (except in the case
of the Via Devana) are old, and three of them, the
Ermine Street, the Icknield Street, and the Fosse
Way, figure in the inquisition of 1070 as being,
together with the Watling Street, those of the Four
Royal Roads (<i>quatuor chimini</i>) of England, the King's
Highways, exempt from local jurisdiction and under
the special guard of the King's Peace. Two are said
to cross the length of the land, two its breadth. But
their identification (except in the case of the main
course of Watling Street) has been matter of antiquarian
dispute from the 12th century downwards.<a name="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a>
The very first chronicler who mentions them, Geoffrey
of Monmouth, makes Ermine Street run from St.
David's to Southampton, Icknield Street from St.
David's to Newcastle, and the Fosse Way from Totnes
in Devon to far Caithness; and his error has misled
many succeeding authorities. That it <i>is</i> an error, at
least with regard to the Icknield Way and the Fosse
Way, is sufficiently proved by the various mediaeval
<span class="newpage"><a name="page168" id="page168">[168]</a></span>
charters which mention these roads in connection
with localities along their course as assigned by our
received geography.</p>

<p>As to the main Watling Street there is no dispute.
Running right across the island from the Irish Sea<a name="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a>
to the Straits of Dover, it suggested to the minds of
our English ancestors the shining track of the Milky
Way from end to end of the heavens. Even so
Chaucer, in his 'House of Fame,' sings:</p>

<div class="blkquot">
&quot;Lo there!&quot; quod he, &quot;cast up your eye,<br />
Se yonder, lo! the Galaxie,<br />
The whiche men clepe the Milky Way,<br />
For it is white, and some, parfay,<br />
Y-callen han it Watlinge-strete.&quot;<br /></div>

<p>At Dover it still retains its name, and so it does in one
part of its course through London (which it enters as
the Edgware Road, and leaves as the Old Kent Road).<a name="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

<p>A. 4.&mdash;This name, like that of the Ermine Street,
is most probably derived from Teutonic mythology;
the &quot;Watlings&quot; being the patrons of handicraft in the
Anglo-Saxon Pantheon, and &quot;Irmin&quot; the War-god from
whom &quot;Germany&quot; is called.<a name="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> There is no reason to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page169" id="page169">[169]</a></span>
suppose that the roads of Britain had any Roman name,
like those of Italy. The designations given them by
our English forefathers show how deeply these mighty
works impressed their imagination. The term &quot;street&quot;
which they adopted for them shows, as Professor
Freeman has pointed out, that such engineering ability
was something quite new to their experience.<a name="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> It is
the Latin &quot;Via <i>strata</i>&quot; Anglicized, and describes no
mere track, but the elaborately constructed Roman
causeway, along which the soft alluvium was first dug
away, and its place taken by layers of graduated road
metal, with the surface frequently an actual pavement.<a name="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p>A. 5.&mdash;For the assignment of the name Ermine
Street to the Great North Road there is no ancient
authority.<a name="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> All we can say is that this theory is more
probable than that set forth by Geoffrey of Monmouth.
That the road existed in Roman times is certain, as
London and York were the two chief towns in the
island; and direct communication between them must
have been of the first importance, both for military
and economical reasons. Indeed it is probably
older yet. (See p. 117.) But, with the exceptions
<span class="newpage"><a name="page170" id="page170">[170]</a></span>
already pointed out, the nomenclature of the
Romano-British roads is almost wholly guess-work. Some
archaeological maps show additional Watling Streets
and Ermine Streets branching in all directions over
the land,<a name="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> presumably on the authority of local
tradition. And these traditions may be not wholly
unfounded; for the same motives which made the
English immigrants of one district ascribe the handiwork
of by-gone days to mythological powers might operate
to the like end in another.</p>

<p>A. 6.&mdash;The origin of the names Ryknield Street
and Akeman Street is beyond discovery;<a name="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> but that of
the Icknield Street is almost undoubtedly due to its
connection with the great Icenian tribe, to whose
territory it formed the only outlet.<a name="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> By them, in the
days of their greatness, it was probably driven to the
Thames, the more southerly extension being perhaps
later. It was never, as its present condition abundantly
testifies, made into a regular Roman &quot;Street.&quot;
The final syllable may possibly, as Guest suggests, be
the A.S. <i>hild</i> = war.</p>

<p>A. 7.&mdash;Besides these main routes, a whole network
of minor roads must have connected the multitudinous
villages and towns of Roman Britain, a fact which is
borne witness to by the very roundabout route often
<span class="newpage"><a name="page171" id="page171">[171]</a></span>
given in the 'Itinerary' of Antoninus between places
which we know were directly connected.<a name="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> Moreover
this network must have been at least as close as that
of our present railways, and probably approximated to
that of our present roads.</p>

<p><i>Romano-British towns&mdash;Ancient lists&mdash;Methods of identification&mdash;Dense rural population<br />
&mdash;Remains in Cam valley&mdash;Coins&mdash;Thimbles&mdash;Horseshoes.</i></p>
<br />
<p>B. 1.&mdash;Of these many Romano-British towns we
have five contemporary lists; those of Ptolemy in the
2nd century, of the Antonine 'Itinerary' in the 3rd, of
the 'Notitia'<a name="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> in the 5th, and those of Nennius and of
the Ravenna Geographer, composed while the memory
of the Roman occupation was still fresh. Ptolemy
and Nennius profess to give complete catalogues; the
'Itinerary' and 'Notitia' contain only incidental
references; while the Ravenna list, though far the
most copious, is expressly stated to be composed only
of selected names. Of these it has no fewer than
236, while the 'Notitia' gives 118, Ptolemy 60, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page172" id="page172">[172]</a></span>
Nennius 28 (to which Marcus Anchoreta adds 5 more).</p>

<p>B. 2.&mdash;With this mass of material<a name="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> it might seem
to be an easy task to locate every Roman site in
Britain; especially as Ptolemy gives the latitude (and
sometimes the longitude<a name="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> also) of every place he
mentions, and the 'Itinerary' the distances between its
stations. Unfortunately it is quite otherwise; and of
the whole number barely fifty can be at all certainly
identified, while more than half cannot even be
guessed at with anything like reasonable probability.
To begin with, the text of every one of these authorities
is corrupt to a degree incredible; in Ptolemy we
find <i>Nalkua</i>, for example, where the 'Itinerary' and
Ravenna lists give <i>Calleva</i>; <i>Simeni</i> figures for
<i>Iceni</i>, <i>Imensa</i> for <i>Tamesis</i>. The 'Itinerary'
itself reads indiscriminately <i>Segeloco</i> and <i>Ageloco</i>,
<i>Lagecio</i> and <i>Legeolio</i>; and examples might be multiplied
indefinitely. In Nennius, particularly, the names are so
disguised that, with two or three exceptions, their
identification is the merest guess-work; <i>Lunden</i> is
unmistakable, and <i>Ebroauc</i> is obviously York; but
who shall say what places lie hid under <i>Meguaid</i>,
<i>Urnath</i>, <i>Guasmoric</i>, and <i>Celemon</i>? And
if this corruption is bad amongst the names, it absolutely
runs riot amongst the numbers, both in Ptolemy and the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page173" id="page173">[173]</a></span>
'Itinerary,' so that the degrees of the former and
the distances of the latter are alike grievously
untrustworthy guides. Ptolemy, for example, says that
the longest day in London is 18 hours, an obvious mistake
for 17, as the context clearly shows. There is further
the actual equation of error in each authority:
Ptolemy, for all his care, has confused Exeter (<i>Isca
Damnoniorum</i>) with the more famous <i>Isca Silurum</i>
(Caerleon-on-Usk); and there are blunders in his
latitude and longitude which cannot wholly be
ascribed to textual corruption. Still another difficulty
is that then, as now, towns quite remote from each
other bore the same name, or names very similar.
Not only were two called <i>Isca</i>, but three were <i>Venta</i>,
two <i>Calleva</i>, two <i>Segontium</i>, and no fewer than seven
<i>Magna</i>; while <i>Durobrivae</i> is only too like to
<i>Durocobrivae</i>, <i>Margiodunum</i> to <i>Moridunum</i>,
<i>Durnovaria</i> to <i>Durovernum</i>, etc. The last name even
gets confounded with <i>Dubris</i> by transcribers.</p>

<p>B. 3.&mdash;In all the lists we are struck by the extraordinary
preponderance of northern names. Half the sites given by
Ptolemy lie north of the Humber, and this is also the case
with the Ravenna list, while in the 'Notitia' the proportion
is far greater. In the last case this is due to the fact
that the military garrisons, with which the catalogue is
concerned, were mainly quartered in the north, and a
like explanation probably holds good for the earlier
and later lists also. Nennius, as is to be expected,
draws most of his names from the districts which the Saxons
had not yet reached; all being given with the Celtic prefix
<i>Caer</i> (=city).</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page174" id="page174">[174]</a></span>
<p>B. 4.&mdash;Amid all these snares the most certain identification
of a Roman site is furnished by the discovery
of inscriptions relating to the special troops with which
the name is associated in historical documents. When,
for example, we find in the Roman station at Birdoswald,
on the Wall of Hadrian, an inscription recording
the occupation of the spot by a Dacian cohort, and
read in the 'Notitia' that such a cohort was posted at
<i>Amboglanna per lineam Valli</i>, we are sure that
Amboglanna and Birdoswald are identical. This method,
unfortunately, helps us very little except on the Wall,
for the legionary inscriptions elsewhere are found in
many places with which history does not particularly
associate the individual legions thus commemorated.<a name="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a>
However, the special number of such traces of the
Second Legion at Caerleon, the Twentieth at Chester,
and the Sixth at York, would alone justify us in certainly
determining those places to be the Isca, Deva,
and Eboracum given as their respective head-quarters
in our documentary and historical evidence.</p>

<p>B. 5.&mdash;In the case of York another proof is available;
for the name, different as it sounds, can be
traced, by a continuous stream of linguistic development,
through the Old English Eorfowic to the Roman <i>Eboracum</i>.
In the same way the name of <i>Dubris</i> has unmistakably
survived in Dover, <i>Lemannae</i> in Lympne, <i>Regulbium</i>
in Reculver. <i>Colonia, Glevum</i>, <i>Venta, Corinium,</i>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page175" id="page175">[175]</a></span>
<i>Danum</i>, and <i>Mancunium</i>, with the suffix &quot;chester,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a>
have become Colchester, Gloucester, Winchester, Cirencester,
Doncaster, and Manchester. Lincoln is <i>Lindum Colonia</i>,
Richborough, <i>Ritupis</i>; while the phonetic value of the
word London has remained absolutely unaltered from the very
first, and varies but slightly even in its historical orthography.</p>

<p>B. 6.&mdash;With names of this class, of which there are
about thirty, for a starting-point, we can next, by the
aid of our various lists (especially Ptolemy's, which
gives the tribe in which each town lies, and the
'Itinerary'), assign, with a very high degree of
probability, some thirty more&mdash;similarity of name being
still more or less of a guide. For example, when
midway between <i>Venta</i> (Winchester) and <i>Sorbiodunum</i>
(Sarum) the 'Itinerary' places <i>Brige</i>, and the name
<i>Broughton</i> now occupies this midway spot, <i>Brige</i> and
<i>Broughton</i> may be safely assumed to be the same.
This method shows Leicester to be the Roman <i>Ratae</i>,
Carlisle to be <i>Luguvallum</i>, Newcastle <i>Pons Aelii</i>, etc.,
with so much probability that none of these identifications
have been seriously disputed amongst antiquaries;
while few are found to deny that Cambridge
represents <i>Camboricum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> Huntingdon (or Godmanchester)
<i>Durolipons</i>, Silchester <i>Calleva</i>, etc. A list of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page176" id="page176">[176]</a></span>
all the sites which may be said to be fairly certified
will be found at the end of this chapter.</p>

<p>B. 7.&mdash;Beyond them we come to about as many more
names in our ancient catalogues of which all we can
say is that we know the district to which they belong,
and may safely apply them to one or other of the
existing Roman sites in that district; the particular
application being disputed with all the heat of the
<i>odium archaeologicum</i>. Thus <i>Bremetonacum</i> was
certainly in Lancashire; but whether it is now Lancaster,
or Overborough, or Ribchester, we will not say;
<i>Caesaromagum</i> was certainly in Essex; but was it
Burghstead, Widford, or Chelmsford? And was the original
<i>Camalodunum</i> at Colchester, Lexden, or Maldon?</p>

<p>B. 8.&mdash;And, yet further, we find, especially in the
Ravenna list, multitudes of names with nothing whatever
to tell us of their whereabouts; though nearly all
have been seized upon by rival antiquaries, and ascribed
to this, that, and the other of the endless Roman sites
which meet us all over the country.<a name="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p>B. 9.&mdash;For it must be remembered that there are
very few old towns in England where Roman remains
have not been found, often in profusion; and even
amongst the villages such finds are exceedingly common
wherever excavations on any large scale have
been undertaken. Thus in the Cam valley, where
the &quot;coprolite&quot; digging<a name="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> resulted in the systematic
<span class="newpage"><a name="page177" id="page177">[177]</a></span>
turning over of a considerable area, their number
is astounding, proving the existence of a teeming
population. Many thousands of coins were turned up,
scarcely ever in hordes, but scattered singly all over
the land, testifying to the amount of petty traffic which
must have gone on generation after generation. For
these coins are very rarely of gold or silver, and
amongst them are found the issues of every Roman
Emperor from Augustus to Valentinian III. And,
besides the coins, the soil was found to teem with
fragments of Roman pottery; while the many &quot;ashpits&quot;
discovered&mdash;as many as thirty in a single not
very large field&mdash;have furnished other articles of
domestic use, such as thimbles.<a name="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> Even horseshoes
have been found, though their use only came in with
the 5th century of our era.<a name="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p>B. 10.&mdash;Now there is no reason for supposing that
the Cam valley was in any way an exceptionally
prosperous or populous district in the Roman period.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page178" id="page178">[178]</a></span>
It contained but one Roman town of even third-class
importance, Cambridge, and very few of the &quot;villas&quot;
in which the great landed proprietors resided. The
wealth of remains which it has furnished is merely a
by-product of the &quot;coprolite&quot; digging, and it is
probable that equally systematic digging would have
like results in almost any alluvial district in the island.
We may therefore regard it as fairly established that
these districts were as thickly peopled under the
Romans as at any other period of history, and that
the agricultural population of our island has never
been larger than in the 3rd and 4th centuries, till its
great development in the 19th.</p>

<br />
<p>C. 1.&mdash;The profound peace which reigned in these
rural districts is shown by the fact that Roman
weapons are the rarest of all finds, far less common
than the earlier British or the ensuing Saxon.<a name="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> At
the same time it is worthy of note that every Roman
<span class="newpage"><a name="page179" id="page179">[179]</a></span>
town which has been excavated has been found to be
fortified, often on a most formidable scale. Thus at
London there still remains visible a sufficiently large
fragment of the wall to show that it must have been
at least thirty feet high, while that of Silchester was nine
feet thick, with a fosse of no less than thirty yards in
width. And at Cirencester the river Churn or Corin
(from which the town took its name <i>Corinium</i>) was
made to flow round the ramparts, which consisted
first of an outer facing of stone, then of a core of
concrete, and finally an earthen embankment within,
the whole reaching a width of at least four yards. It
is probable, however, that these defences, like those
of so many of the Gallic cities, and like the Aurelian
walls of Rome itself; belong to the decadent period of
Roman power, and did not exist (except in the
northern garrisons and the great legionary stations,
York, Chester, and Caerleon) during the golden age of
Roman Britain.<a name="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p>C. 2.&mdash;Their circuit, where it has been traced,
furnishes a rough gauge of the comparative importance
of the Roman towns of Britain. Far at the
head stands London, where the names of Ludgate,
Newgate, Aldersgate, Moorgate, Bishopsgate, and Aldgate
still mark the ancient boundary line, five miles
in extent (including the river-front), nearly twice
that of any other town.<a name="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> And abundant traces of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page180" id="page180">[180]</a></span>
the existence of a flourishing suburb have been
discovered on the southern bank of the river. To
London ran nearly all the chief Roman roads, and
the shapeless block now called London Stone was
once the <i>Milliarium</i> from which the distances were
reckoned along their course throughout the land.<a name="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<p>C. 3.&mdash;The many relics of the Roman occupation
to be seen in the Museum at the Guildhall bear
further testimony to the commercial importance of
the City in those early days, an importance primarily
due, as we have already seen, to the natural facilities
for crossing the Thames at London Bridge.<a name="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> The
greatness of Roman London seems, however, to
have been purely commercial. We do not even
know that it was the seat of government for its
own division of Britain. It was not a Colony, nor
(in spite of the exceptional strength of the site, surrounded,
as it was, by natural moats)<a name="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> does it ever
appear as of military importance till the campaign of
Theodosius at the very end of the chapter.<a name="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> In the
'Notitia' it figures as the head-quarters of the
Imperial Treasury, and about the same date we learn
that the name Augusta had been bestowed upon the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page181" id="page181">[181]</a></span>
town, as on Caerleon and on so many others throughout
the Empire, though the older &quot;London&quot; still
remained unforgotten.<a name="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p>C. 4.&mdash;But, so far as Britain had a recognized
capital at all, York and not London best deserved
that name. For here was the chief military nerve-centre
of the land, the head-quarters of the Army,
where the Commander-in-Chief found himself in ready
touch with the thick array of garrisons holding every
strategic point along the various routes by which any
invader who succeeded in forcing the Wall would
penetrate into the land. At York, accordingly, the
Emperors who visited Britain mostly held their court;
beginning with Hadrian, who here established the
Sixth Legion which he had brought over with him,
possibly incorporating with it the remains of the
Ninth, traces of which are here found. And here
it remained permanently quartered to the very end of
the Roman occupation, as abundant inscriptions, etc.
testify. One of these, found in the excavations for
the railway station, is a brass tablet with a dedication
(in Greek) to <i>The Gods of the Head Praetorium</i> (&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#969;&#961;&#8055;&#959;&#965;) [<b>theois
tois tou haegemonikou praitoriou</b>], bearing witness to the
essential militarism of the city.</p>

<p>C. 5.&mdash;A Praetorium, moreover, was not merely a
military centre. It was also, as at Jerusalem, a
Judgment Hall; and here, probably, the <i>Juridicus
Britanniae</i><a name="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> exercised his functions, which would seem
<span class="newpage"><a name="page182" id="page182">[182]</a></span>
to have been something resembling those of a Lord
Chief Justice. Precedents laid down by his Court
are quoted as still in force even by the Codex of
Justinian (555). One of these incidentally lets us
know that the Romans kept up not only a British
Army, but a British Fleet in being.<a name="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> The latter,
probably, as well as the former, had its head-quarters
at York, where the Ouse of old furnished a far more
available waterway than now. Even so late as 1066
the great fleet of Harold Hardrada could anchor only
a few miles off, at Riccall: and there is good evidence
that in the Roman day the river formed an extensive
&quot;broad&quot; under the walls of York itself. As at
Portsmouth and Plymouth to-day, the presence of
officers and seamen of the Imperial Navy must have
added to the military bustle in the streets of Eboracum;
while tesselated pavements, unknown in the ruder
fortresses of the Wall, testify to the softer side of
social life in a garrison town.</p>

<p>C. 6.&mdash;Chester [Deva] was also a garrison town,
the head-quarters of the Twentieth Legion; so was
Caerleon-upon-Usk [Isca], with the Second. A detachment
was almost certainly detailed from one or other
of these to hold Wroxeter [Uriconium], midway
<span class="newpage"><a name="page183" id="page183">[183]</a></span>
between them;<a name="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> thus securing the line of the Marches
between the wild districts of Wales and the more
fertile and settled regions eastward. And the name of
Leicester records the fact (not otherwise known to us)
that here too was a military centre; probably sufficient
to police the rest of the island.<a name="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

<p>C. 7.&mdash;Gloucester, Colchester, and Lincoln, as
being Colonies, may have been also, perhaps, always
fortified, and possibly garrisoned. But in the ordinary
Romano-British town, such as London, Silchester, or
Bath,<a name="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> the life was probably wholly civilian. The
fortifications, if the place ever had any, were left to
decay or removed, the soldiery were withdrawn or
converted into a mere <i>gendarmerie</i>, and under the
shield of the <i>Pax Romana</i>, the towns were as open as
now. And as little as now did they look forward to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page184" id="page184">[184]</a></span>
a time when each would have to become a strongly-held
place of arms girded in by massive ramparts,
yet destined to prove all too weak against the sweep
of barbarian invasion.</p>

<p>C. 8.&mdash;On most of these sites continuous occupation
for many subsequent ages has blotted out the vestiges
of their Roman day. Every town has a tendency
literally to bury its past; and the larger the town
the deeper the burial. Thus at London the Roman
pavements, etc. found are some twenty feet below
the present surface, at Lincoln some six or seven, and
so forth. To learn how a Roman town was actually
laid out we must have recourse to those places which
for some reason have not been resettled since their
destruction at the Anglo-Saxon conquest, such as
Wroxeter and Silchester, where the remains accordingly
lie only a foot or two below the ground. The
former has been little explored, but the latter has for
the last ten years been systematically excavated under
the auspices of the Society of Antiquaries, the portions
unearthed being reburied year by year, after careful
examination and record.<a name="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p>C. 9.&mdash;The greater part of the site has thus been
already (1903) dealt with; proving the town to have
been laid out on a regular plan, with straight streets
dividing it, like an American city, into rectangular
blocks. Twenty-eight of these have, so far, been
excavated. They are from 100 to 150 yards in length
<span class="newpage"><a name="page185" id="page185">[185]</a></span>
and breadth, arranged, like the blocks in a modern
town, with houses all round, and a central space
for gardens, back-yards, etc. The remains found
(including coins from Caligula to Arcadius) prove that
the site was occupied during the whole of the Roman
period. Originally it was, in all probability, one of
the towns built for the Britons by Agricola<a name="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a> on the
distinctive Roman pattern, with a central forum, town
hall, baths, temples, and an amphitheatre outside the
city limits.</p>

<p>C. 10.&mdash;The forum was flanked by a vast basilica, no
less than 325 feet in length by 125 in breadth, with
apses of 39 feet radius.<a name="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a> A smaller edifice of basilican
type is generally supposed to have been a Christian
church. It stands east and west, and consists of a
nave 30 feet long by 10 broad, flanked by 5-feet
aisles, with a narthex of 7 feet (extending right across
the building) at the east end, and at the west an apse
of 10 feet radius, having in the centre a tesselated
pavement 6 feet square, presumably for the Altar.<a name="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p>C. 11.&mdash;The main street of Silchester ran east
and west, and <i>may</i> have been the main road from
<span class="newpage"><a name="page186" id="page186">[186]</a></span>
London to Bath; while that which crosses it at the
forum was perhaps an extension of the Icknield Way
from Wallingford to Winchester. A third road led
straight to Old Sarum,<a name="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> and there may have been
others. Silchester lies about half-way between
Reading and Basingstoke.</p>

<p>C. 12.&mdash;The relics of domestic life found indicate
a high order of peaceful civilization. Abundance
of domestic pottery (some of it the glazed ware
manufactured at Caistor on the Nen), many bones of
domestic animals (amongst them the cat),<a name="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> finger-rings
with engraved gems, and the like, have been
discovered in the old wells<a name="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a> and ashpits. More
remarkable was the unearthing (in 1899) of the plant
of a silver refinery,<a name="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> showing that the method employed
was analogous to that in vogue amongst the Japanese
to-day, and that bone-ash was used in the construction
of the hearths.<a name="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a> The houses were mainly built of red
<span class="newpage"><a name="page187" id="page187">[187]</a></span>
clay (on a foundation wall of flint and mortar) filled
into a timber frame-work and supported by lath or
wattle. The exterior was stamped with ornamental
patterns, as in modern &quot;parjetting&quot; (which may thus
very possibly be an actual survival from Roman days).
This clay has in most cases soaked away into a mere
layer of red mud overlying the pavements; but in
1901 there was unearthed a house in which a fortunate
fire had calcined it into permanent brick, still
retaining the parjetting and the impress of wattle and
timber. But the whole site has not provided a single
weapon of any sort or kind, and the construction of
the defences clearly shows that they formed no part
of the original plan on which the place was laid out.<a name="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a>
They were probably, as we have said, added at the
break up of the Pax Romana.</p>

<p>C. 13.&mdash;With the exception of the silver refinery
above mentioned, nothing has appeared to tell us
what handicrafts were practised at Silchester; but
such industries formed a noteworthy feature of
Romano-British life. Naturally the largest traces have
been left in connection with that most imperishable of
all commodities, pottery. The kilns where it was made
are frequently met with in excavations; and individual
vases, jugs,<a name="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> cups, and amphorae (often of very large
dimensions) constantly appear. Many of these are
<span class="newpage"><a name="page188" id="page188">[188]</a></span>
beautifully modelled and finished, and not unseldom
glazed in various ways. But there is no evidence
that the delicate &quot;Samian&quot; ware<a name="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> was ever manufactured
in Britain, though every house of any pretensions
possessed a certain store of it. The indigenous
art of basket-making<a name="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a> also continued as a speciality
of Britain under the Romans, and the indigenous
mining for tin, lead, iron, and copper was developed
by them on the largest scale. In every district where
these metals are found, in Cornwall, in Somerset, in
Wales, in Derbyshire, and in Sussex, traces of Roman
work are apparent, dating from the very beginning of
the occupation to the very end. The earliest known
Roman inscription found in Britain is one of A.D. 49
(the year before Ostorius subdued the Iceni) on a pig
of lead from the Mendips,<a name="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> and similar pigs bearing
the Labarum, <i>i.e.</i> not earlier than Constantine
presumably, have been dredged up in the Thames below
London.<a name="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> Inscriptions also survive to tell us of a
few amongst the many other trades which must have
figured in Romano-British life,&mdash;goldsmiths, silversmiths,
iron-workers, stone-cutters, sculptors, architects,
eye-doctors, are all thus commemorated.<a name="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<p>C. 14.&mdash;But then, as always, the life of Britain was
mainly rural. The evidence for this unearthed in the
Cam valley has already been spoken of, and in every
part of England the &quot;villas&quot; of the great Roman
<span class="newpage"><a name="page189" id="page189">[189]</a></span>
landowners are constantly found. Hundreds have
already been discovered, and year by year the list is
added to. One of the most recent of the finds is that
at Greenwich in 1901, and the best known, perhaps,
that at Brading in the Isle of Wight. Here, as elsewhere,
the tesselated pavements, the elaborate arrangements
for warming (by hypocausts conveying
hot air to every room), the careful laying out of the
apartments, all testify to the luxury in which these old
landlords lived. For the &quot;villa&quot; was the Squire's
Hall of the period, and was provided, like the great
country houses of to-day, with all the best that
contemporary life could give.<a name="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> And, like these
also, it was the centre of a large circle of humbler
dependencies wherein resided the peasantry of the estate
and the domestics of the mansion.<a name="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> The existence
amongst these of huntsmen (as inscriptions tell)
reminds us that not only was the chase, then as now,
popular amongst the squirearchy, but that there was
a far larger scope for its exercise. Great forests still
covered a notable proportion of the soil (the largest
being that which spread over the whole Weald of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page190" id="page190">[190]</a></span>
Sussex)<a name="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a>, and were tenanted by numberless deer and
wild swine, along with the wolves, and, perhaps,
bears,<a name="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a> that fed upon them.</p>

<p>C. 15.&mdash;Hence it came about that during the
Roman occupation the British products we find
most spoken of by classical authors are the famous
breeds of hunting-dogs produced by our island.
Oppian<a name="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a> [A.D. 140] gives a long description of one
sort, which he describes as small &#946;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957; [<b>baion</b>],
awkward &#947;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#957; [<b>guron</b>], long-bodied, rough-haired,
not much to look at, but excellent at scenting out their
game and tackling it when found&mdash;like our present
otter-hounds. The native name for this strain was Agasseus.
Nemesianus<a name="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a> [A.D. 280] sings the swiftness of British
hounds; and Claudian<a name="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a> refers to a more, formidable
kind, used for larger game, equal indeed to pulling
down a bull. He is commonly supposed to mean
some species of mastiff; but, according to Mr. Elton<a name="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a>
mastiffs are a comparatively recent importation from
Central Asia, so that a boarhound of some sort is
more probably intended, such as may be seen depicted
(along with its smaller companion) on the fine
tesselated pavement preserved in the Corinium
<span class="newpage"><a name="page191" id="page191">[191]</a></span>
Museum at Cirencester.<a name="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> Whatever the creature was,
it is probably the same as the Scotch &quot;fighting dog,&quot;
which figures in the 4th century polemics as a huge
massive brute of savage temper<a name="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> and evil odour,<a name="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a>
to which accordingly controversialists rejoice in likening
their ecclesiastical opponents.<a name="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> Jerome incidentally
tells us that &quot;Alpine&quot; dogs were of this Scotch
breed, which thus may possibly be the original strain
now developed into the St. Bernard.</p>

<p>C. 16.&mdash;But the existence of such tracts of forest,
even when very extensive, is quite compatible (as the
present state of France shows us) with a highly
developed civilization, and a population thick upon
the ground. And that a very large area of our soil
came to be under the plough at least before the
Roman occupation ended is proved by the fact that
eight hundred wheat-ships were dispatched from this
island by Julian the Apostate for the support of his
garrisons in Gaul. The terms in which this transaction
is recorded suggest that wheat was habitually exported
(on a smaller scale, doubtless) from Britain to the
Continent. At all events enough was produced for
home consumption, and under the shadow of the
Pax Romana the wild and warlike Briton became a
quiet cultivator of the ground, a peaceful and not
discontented dependent of the all-conquering Power
which ruled the whole civilized world.</p>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page192" id="page192">[192]</a></span>
<p>C. 17.&mdash;In the country the husbandman ploughed
and sowed and reaped and garnered,<a name="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a> sometimes as a
freeholder, oftener as a tenant; the miller was found
upon every stream; the fisher baited his hook and
cast his net in fen and mere; the Squire hunted and
feasted amid his retainers (who were usually slaves);
his wife and daughters occupied themselves in the
management of the house. The language of Rome
was everywhere spoken, the literature of Rome was
read amongst the educated classes; while amongst
the peasantry the old Celtic tongue, and with it, we
may be sure, the old Celtic legends and songs, held
its own. Intercourse was easy between the various
districts; for along every great road a series of posting-stations,
each with its stud of relays, was available for
the service of travellers. In the towns were to be
found schools, theatres, and courts of justice, with
shops of every sort and kind, while travelling pedlars
supplied the needs of the rural districts. No one,
except actual soldiers, dreamt of bearing arms, or
indeed was allowed to do so,<a name="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> and the general aspect
of the land was as wholly peaceful as now. But
every one had to pay a substantial proportion of his
income in taxes, in the collection of which there was
not seldom a notable amount of corruption, as
amongst the publicans of Judaea. In the bad days
of the decadence this became almost intolerable;<a name="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page193" id="page193">[193]</a></span>
but so long as the central administration retained its
integrity the amount exacted was no more than left to
every class a fair margin for the needs, and even the
enjoyments, of life.</p>

<p><i>The unconquered North&mdash;Hadrian's Wall&mdash;Upper and Lower Britain&mdash;Romano-British coinage&mdash;Wall<br />
of Antoninus&mdash;Britain Pro-consular.</i></p>
<br />
<p>D. 1.&mdash;The weak point of all this peaceful development
was that the northern regions of the island
remained unsubdued. It was all very well for the
Roman Treasury, with true departmental shortsightedness,
to declare (as Appian<a name="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> reports) that North Britain
was a worthless district, which could never be profitable
&#949;&#965;&#960;&#951;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#957; [<b>euphoron</b>] to hold. The cost
would have been cheap in the end. All through
the Roman occupation it was from the north that
trouble was liable to arise, and ultimately it was
the ferocious independence of the Highland clans
that brought Roman Britain to its doom. The
Saxons, as tradition tells us, would never have been
invited into the land but for the ravages of these Picts;
and, in sober history, it may well be doubted whether
they could ever have effected a permanent settlement
here had not the Britons, in defending our shores,
been constantly exposed to Pictish attacks from the
rear.</p>

<p>D. 2.&mdash;Thus our earliest notice of Britain in this
<span class="newpage"><a name="page194" id="page194">[194]</a></span>
period tells us that Hadrian (A.D. 120), our first
Imperial visitor since Claudius (A.D. 44), found it
needful (after a revolt which cost many lives, and
involved, as it seems, the final destruction of the
unlucky Ninth Legion, which had already fared so
badly in Boadicea's rebellion<a name="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a>) to supplement Agricola's
rampart, between Forth and Clyde, with another
from sea to sea, between Tynemouth and Solway,
&quot;dividing the Romans from the barbarians.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a> This
does not mean that the district thus isolated was
definitely abandoned,<a name="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a> but that its inhabitants were
so imperfectly Romanized that the temptation to raid
the more civilized lands to the south had better be
obviated. The Wall of Hadrian marked the real
limit of Roman Britain: beyond it was a &quot;march,&quot;
sometimes strongly, more often feebly, garrisoned, but
never effectually occupied, much less civilized. The
inhabitants, indeed, seem to have rapidly lost what
civilization they had. Dion Cassius describes them,
in the next generation, as far below the Caledonians
who opposed Agricola, a mere horde of squalid and
ferocious cannibals,<a name="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> going into battle stark-naked
(like their descendants the Galwegians a thousand
years later),<a name="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> having neither chief nor law, fields nor
houses. The name Attacotti, by which they came
<span class="newpage"><a name="page195" id="page195">[195]</a></span>
finally to be known, probably means <i>Tributary</i>, and
describes their nominal status towards Rome.</p>

<p>D. 3.&mdash;How hopeless the task of effectually
incorporating these barbarians within the Empire
appeared to Hadrian is shown by the extraordinary
massiveness of the Wall which he built<a name="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> to keep them
out from the civilized Provinces<a name="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a> to the southwards.
&quot;Uniting the estuaries of Tyne and Solway it chose
the strongest line of defence available. Availing
itself of a series of bold heights, which slope steadily
to the south, but are craggy precipices to the north,
as if designed by Nature for this very purpose, it
pursued its mighty course across the isthmus with
a pertinacious, undeviating determination which makes
its remains unique in Europe, and one of the most
inspiriting scenes in Britain.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> Its outer fosse
(where the nature of the ground permits) is from 30
to 40 feet wide and some 20 deep, so sloped that the
whole was exposed to direct fire from the Wall, from
which it is separated by a small glacis [<i>linea</i>] 10 or 12
feet across. Beyond it the upcast earth is so disposed
<span class="newpage"><a name="page196" id="page196">[196]</a></span>
as to form the glacis proper, for about 50 feet before
dipping to the general ground level. The Wall itself
is usually 8 feet thick, the outer and inner faces
formed of large blocks of freestone, with an interior
core of carefully-filled-in rubble. The whole thus
formed a defence of the most formidable character,
testifying strongly to the respect in which the valour
of the Borderers against whom it was constructed was
held by Hadrian and his soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<p>D. 4.&mdash;This expedition of Hadrian is cited by his
biographer, Aelius Spartianus, as the most noteworthy
example of that invincible activity which led him to
take personal cognizance of every region in his
Empire: &quot;<i>Ante omnes enitebatur ne quid otiosum vel
emeret aliquando vel pasceret.&quot;</i> His contempt for
slothful self-indulgence finds vent in his reply to the
doggerel verses of Florus, who had written:</p>

<table>
<tr><td><i>Ego nolo Caesar esse,</i></td>       <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&quot;To be Caesar I'd not care,</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Ambulare per Britannos,</i></td>         <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Britons far to fare,</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Scythicas pati pruinas</i>.</td>      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scythian frost and cold to bear.&quot;]</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Hadrian made answer:</p>

<table>
<tr><td><i>Ego nolo Florus esse,</i></td>     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&quot;To be Florus I'd not care,</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Ambulare per tabernas,</i></td>       <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the tavern-bars to fare,</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Cimices pati rotundas</i>.</td>       <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noxious insect-bites to bear.&quot;]</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To us its special interest (besides the Wall) is
<span class="newpage"><a name="page197" id="page197">[197]</a></span>
found in the bronze coins commemorating the occasion,
the first struck with special reference to Britain
since those of Claudius. These are of various types,
but all of the year 120 (the third Consulate of Hadrian);
and the reverse mostly represents the figure so familiar
on our present bronze coinage, Britannia, spear in
hand, on her island rock, with her shield beside her.<a name="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a>
This type was constantly repeated with slight variations
in the coinage of the next hundred years; and
thus, when, after an interval of twelve centuries, the
British mint began once more, in the reign of Charles
the Second, to issue copper, this device was again
adopted, and still abides with us. The very large
number of types (approaching a hundred) of the
Romano-British coinage, from this reign to that of
Caracalla, shows that Hadrian inaugurated the system
of minting coins not only with reference to Britain,
but for special local use. They were doubtless struck
within the island; but we can only conjecture where
the earliest mints were situated.</p>

<p>D. 5.&mdash;Twenty years after Hadrian's visit we again
find (A.D. 139) some little trouble in the north,
owing to a feud between the Brigantes and Genuini,
a clan of whom nothing is known but the name.
The former seem to have been the aggressors, and
were punished by the confiscation of a section of their
territory by Lollius Urbicus, the Legate of Antoninus
Pius; who further &quot;shut off the excluded barbarians
<span class="newpage"><a name="page198" id="page198">[198]</a></span>
by a turf wall&quot; (<i>muro cespitio submotis<a name="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a> barbaris
ducto</i>). The context connects this operation with the
Brigantian troubles; but it is certain that Lollius
repaired and strengthened Agricola's rampart between
Forth and Clyde. His name is found in inscriptions
along that line,<a name="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> and that of Antoninus is frequent.
This work consisted of a <i>vallum</i> some 40 miles in
length, from Carriden to Dumbarton, with fortified
posts at frequent intervals. It is locally known as
&quot;Graham's Dyke,&quot; and, since 1890, has been systematically
explored by the Glasgow Archaeological Society. It is in
the strictest sense &quot;a turf wall&quot;&mdash;no mere grass-grown
earthwork, but regularly built of squared sods in place
of stones (sometimes on a stone base). Roman engineers
looked upon such a rampart as being the hardest of all
to construct.</p>

<br />
<p>E. 1.&mdash;It may very probably be owing to the
energy of Lollius that Britain, &quot;Upper&quot; and &quot;Lower&quot;
together as it seems, as inscriptions tell us, was about
this date ranked amongst the Senatorial Provinces of
the Empire, the Pro-consul being C. Valerius Pansa.

That it should have been made a Pro-consulate
shows (as is pointed out on p. 142) that they were
now considered amongst the more peaceful governorships.
In fact, though some slight disturbances
threatened at the death of Antoninus (A.D. 161), the
country remained quiet till Commodus came to the
throne (A.D. 180). Then, however, we hear of a
serious inroad of the northern barbarians, who burst
over the Roman Wall and were not repulsed without
a hard campaign. The Roman commander was
Ulpius Marcellus, a harsh but devoted officer, who
fared like a common soldier, and insisted on the
strictest vigilance, being himself &quot;the most sleepless
of generals.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> The British Army, accordingly, swore
by him, and were minded to proclaim him Emperor,[2]
a matter which all but cost him his life at the hands
of Commodus; who, however, contented himself with
assuming, like Claudius, the title of Britannicus, in
virtue of this success.[2] The further precaution was
taken of cashiering not only Ulpius but all the
superior officers of this dangerous army; men of
lower rank and less influence being substituted. The
soldiers, however, defeated the design by breaking
out into open mutiny, and tearing to pieces the
&quot;enemy of the Army,&quot; Perennis, Praefect of the
Praetorian Guards, who had been sent from Rome
(A.D. 185) to carry out the reform.<a name="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p>E. 2.&mdash;This episode shows us how great a solidarity
the Army of Britain had by this time developed. It
<span class="newpage"><a name="page200" id="page200">[200]</a></span>
was always the policy of Imperial Rome to recruit
the forces stationed throughout the Provinces not
from the natives around them, but from those of
distant regions. Inscriptions tell that the British
Legions were chiefly composed of Spaniards, Aquitanians,
Gauls, Frisians, Dalmatians, and Dacians; while from
the 'Notitia' we know that, in the 5th century, such
distant countries as Mauretania, Libya, and even Assyria,<a name="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a>
furnished contingents. Britons, in turn, served in Gaul,
Spain, Illyria, Egypt, and Armenia, as well as in Rome itself.</p>

<p>E. 3.&mdash;The outburst which led to the slaughter of
Perennis was but the dawn of a long era of military
turbulence in Britain. First came the suppression of
the revolt A.D. 187 by the new Legate,<a name="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a> Pertinax,
who, at the peril of his life, refused the purple offered
him by the mutineers,<a name="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> and drafted fifteen hundred of
the ringleaders into the Italian service of Commodus;<a name="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a>
then Commodus died (A.D. 192), and Pertinax
became one of the various pretenders to the Imperial
throne; then followed his murder by Julianus, while
Albinus succeeded to his pretensions as well as
to his British government; then that of Julianus by
Severus; then the desperate struggle between Albinus
and Severus for the Empire; the crushing defeat
(A.D. 197) of the British Army at Lyons, the death
of Albinus,<a name="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a> and the final recognition of Severus<a name="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page201" id="page201">[201]</a></span>
as the acknowledged ruler of the whole Roman
world.</p>

<p>E. 4.&mdash;Of all the Roman Emperors Severus is the
most closely connected with Britain. The long-continued
political and military confusion amongst
the conquerors had naturally excited the independent
tribes of the north. In A.D. 201 the Caledonians
beyond Agricola's rampart threatened it so seriously
that Vinius Lupus, the Praetor, was fain to buy off
their attack; and, a few years later, they actually
joined hands with the nominally subject Meatae within
the Pale, who thereupon broke out into open rebellion,
and, along with them, poured down upon the civilized
districts to the south. So extreme was the danger
that the Prefect of Britain sent urgent dispatches to
Rome, invoking the Emperor's own presence with the
whole force of the Empire.</p>

<p>E. 5.&mdash;Severus, in spite of age and infirmity,<a name="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a> responded
to the call, and, in a marvellously short time,
appeared in Britain, bringing with him his worthless
sons, Caracalla<a name="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> and Geta<a name="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a>&mdash;&quot;my Antonines,&quot; as he
fondly called them,<a name="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> though his life was already
embittered by their wickedness,&mdash;and Geta's yet more
worthless mother, Julia Domna. Leaving her and
her son in charge south of Hadrian's Wall, Severus and
Caracalla undertook a punitive expedition<a name="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> beyond it,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page202" id="page202">[202]</a></span>
characterized by ferocity so exceptional<a name="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> that the names
both of Caledonians and Meatae henceforward disappear
from history. The Romans on this occasion
penetrated further than even Agricola had gone, and
reached Cape Wrath, where Severus made careful
astronomical observations.<a name="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p>E. 6.&mdash;But the cost was fearful. Fifty thousand
Roman soldiers perished through the rigour of the
climate and the wiles of the desperate barbarians; and
Severus felt the north so untenable that he devoted
all his energies to strengthening Hadrian's Wall,<a name="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a> so as
to render it an impregnable barrier beyond which the
savages might be allowed to range as they pleased.<a name="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p>E. 7.&mdash;In what, exactly, his additions consisted we
do not know, but they were so extensive that his name
is no less indissolubly connected with the Wall than
that of Hadrian. The inscriptions of the latter found
in the &quot;Mile Castles&quot; show that the line was his
work, and that he did not merely, as some have
thought, build the series of &quot;stations&quot; to support the
&quot;Vallum.&quot; But it is highly probable that Severus so
strengthened the Wall both in height and thickness as
to make it<a name="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> far more formidable than Hadrian had
<span class="newpage"><a name="page203" id="page203">[203]</a></span>
left it. For now it was intended to be the actual <i>limes</i>
of the Empire.</p>

<br />
<p>F. 1.&mdash;It is to Severus, therefore, that we owe the
final development of this magnificent rampart, the
mere remains of which are impressive so far beyond
all that description or drawing can tell. Only those
who have stood upon the heights by Peel Crag and
seen the long line of fortification crowning ridge after
ridge in endless succession as far as the eye can reach,
can realize the sense of the vastness and majesty of
Roman Imperialism thus borne in upon the mind.
And if this is so now that the Wall is a ruin scarcely
four feet high, and, but for its greater breadth,
indistinguishable from the ordinary local field-walls,
what must it have been when its solid masonry rose to a
height of over twenty feet; with its twenty-three strong
fortresses<a name="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> for the permanent quarters of the garrison,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page204" id="page204">[204]</a></span>
its great gate-towers<a name="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a> at every mile for the accommodation
of the detachments on duty, and its series of
watch-turrets which, at every three or four hundred
yards, placed sentinels within sight and call of each
other along the whole line from sea to sea?</p>

<p>F. 2.&mdash;Of all this swarming life no trace now
remains. So entirely did it cease to be that the very
names of the stations have left no shadow of memories
on their sites. Luguvallum at the one end, and Pons
Aelii at the other, have revived into importance as
Carlisle and Newcastle,<a name="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a> but of the rest few indeed
remain save as solitary ruins on the bare Northumbrian
fells tenanted only by the flock and the curlew.
But this very solitude in which their names have
perished has preserved to us the means of recovering
them. Thanks to it there is no part of Britain so
rich in Roman remains and Roman inscriptions. At no
fewer than twelve of these &quot;stations&quot; such have been
already found relating to troops whom we know from
the 'Notitia' to have been quartered at given spots
<i>per lineam valli</i>. A Dacian cohort (for example) has
thus left its mark at Birdoswald, and an Asturian at
Chesters, thereby stamping these sites as respectively
the <i>Amboglanna</i> and <i>Cilurnum</i>, whose Dacian and
Asturian garrisons the 'Notitia' records. The old walls
of Cilurnum, moreover, are still clothed with a pretty
little Pyrenaean creeper, <i>Erinus Hispanicus</i>, which these
<span class="newpage"><a name="page205" id="page205">[205]</a></span>
Asturian exiles must have brought with them as a
memorial of their far-off home.</p>

<p>F. 3.&mdash;Many such small but vivid touches of the
past meet those who visit the Wall. At &quot;King Arthur's
Well,&quot; for example, near Thirlwall, the tiny chives
growing in the crevices of the rock are presumably
descendants of those acclimatized there by Roman
gastronomy. At Borcovicus (&quot;House-steads&quot;) the
wheel-ruts still score the pavement; at Cilurnum the
hypocaust of the bath is still blackened with smoke,
and at various points the decay of Roman prestige is
testified to by the walling up of one half or the other
in the wide double gates which originally facilitated
the sorties of the garrisons.</p>

<p>F. 4.&mdash;- The same decay is probably the key to the
problem of the &quot;Vallum,&quot; that standing crux to all
archaeological students of the Wall. Along the whole
line this mysterious earthwork keeps company with
the Wall on the south, sometimes in close contact,
sometimes nearly a mile distant. It has been diversely
explained as an earlier British work, as put up by the
Romans to cover the fatigue-parties engaged in building
the Wall, and as a later erection intended to
defend the garrison against attacks from the rear.
Each of these views has been keenly debated; the
last having the support of the late Dr. Bruce, the
highest of all authorities on the mural antiquities.
And excavations, even the very latest, have produced
results which are claimed by each of the rival theories.<a name="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page206" id="page206">[206]</a></span>
<p>F. 5.&mdash;Quite possibly all are in measure true. The
&quot;Vallum&quot; as we now see it is obviously meant for
defence against a southern foe. But the spade has
given abundant evidence that the rampart has been
altered, and that, in many places at least, it at one
time faced northwards. Though not an entirely
satisfactory solution of the problem, the following
sequence of events would seem, on the whole, best
to explain the phenomena with which we are confronted.
Originally a British earthwork<a name="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> defending the
Brigantes against the cattle-lifting raids of their restless
northern neighbours, the &quot;Vallum&quot; was adapted<a name="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a>
for like purposes by the Romans, and that more than
once. After being thus utilized, first, perhaps, by
Agricola, and afterwards by Hadrian (for the protection
of his working-parties engaged in quarrying
stone for the outer fortifications), it became useless
when the Wall was finally completed,<a name="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a> and remained
a mere unfortified mound so long as the Roman
power in Southern Britain continued undisturbed.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page207" id="page207">[207]</a></span>
<p>But when the garrison of the Wall became liable to
attacks from the rear, the &quot;Vallum&quot; was once more
repaired, very probably by Theodosius,<a name="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a> and this time
with a ditch to the south, to enable the soldiers to
meet, if needful, a simultaneous assault of Picts in
front and Scots<a name="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> or Saxons behind. Weak though
it was as compared to the Wall, it would still
take a good deal of storming, if stoutly held, and
would effectually guard against any mere raid both
the small parties marching along the Military Way<a name="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a>
from post to post, and the cattle grazing along the
rich meadows which frequently lie between the two
lines of fortification.</p>

<p>F.6.&mdash;As we have said, the line of country thus
occupied teems with relics of the occupation. Coins
by the thousand, ornaments, fragments of statuary,
inscriptions to the Emperors, to the old Roman gods,
to the strange Pantheistic syncretisms of the later
Mithraism<a name="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a>, to unknown (perhaps local) deities such
<span class="newpage"><a name="page208" id="page208">[208]</a></span>
as Coventina, records of this, that, and the other body
of troops in the garrison, personal dedications and
memorials&mdash;all have been found, and are still constantly
being found, in rich abundance. Of the whole number of
Romano-British inscriptions known, nearly half belong
to the Wall.<a name="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a></p>

<p>F.7.&mdash;As an example of these inscriptions we
may give one discovered at Caervoran (the Roman
<i>Magna</i>), and now in the Newcastle Antiquarian
Museum,<a name="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> the interpretation of which has been a
matter of considerable discussion amongst antiquaries.

Ex quis muneribus nosse contigit Deos.<br />

<p>F. 8.&mdash;These obscure lines Dr. Hodgkin refers to
Julia Domna, the wife of Severus, the one Emperor
that Africa gave to the Roman world. He was an
able astrologer, and from early youth considered
himself destined by his horoscope for the throne. He
<span class="newpage"><a name="page210" id="page210">[210]</a></span>
was thus guided by astrological considerations to take
for his second wife a Syrian virgin, whose nativity he
found to forecast queenship. As his Empress she
shared in the aureole of divinity which rested upon all
members of the Imperial family. This theory explains
the references in the inscription to the constellation
Virgo, with its chief star Spica, having Leo on the one
hand and Libra on the other, also to the Syrian origin
of Julia and her connection with Libya, the home of
Severus. It may be added that Dr. Hodgkin's view is
confirmed by the fact that this Empress figures, on
coins found in Britain, as the Mother of the Gods, and
also as Ceres. The first line may possibly have special
reference to her influence in Britain during the reign
of Severus and her stepson<a name="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> Caracalla (who was also her
second husband), Leo being a noted astrological sign
of Britain.<a name="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> The inscription was evidently put up in
recognition of promotion gained by her favour, though
the exact interpretation of <i>Tribunus in praefecto</i> requires
a greater knowledge of Roman military nomenclature
than we possess. Dr. Hodgkin's &quot;Tribune instead of
Prefect&quot; seems scarcely admissible grammatically.</p>

<p>F. 9.&mdash;Another inscription which may be mentioned
is that referred to by Tennyson in 'Gareth and
Lynette' (l. 172), which</p>

<span style="margin-left: 21em;">&quot;the vexillary</span><br />

<span class="newpage"><a name="page211" id="page211">[211]</a></span>
<p>This is one of the many such records in the quarries
south of the Wall telling of the labours of the
fatigue-parties sent out by Severus to hew stones for
his mighty work, and cut on rocks overhanging the river.
It sets forth how a <i>vexillatio</i><a name="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> of the Second Legion
was here engaged, under a lieutenant [<i>optio</i>] named
Agricola, in the consulship of Aper and Maximus (A.D.
207);<a name="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a> perhaps as a guard over the actual workers,
who were probably a <i>corv&eacute;e</i> of impressed natives.</p>

<p>F. 10.&mdash;Yet another inscription worth notice was
unearthed in 1897, and tells how a water supply to
Cilurnum was brought from a source in the neighbourhood
through a subterraneous conduit by Asturian
engineers under Ulpius Marcellus (A.D. 160). That
this should have been done brings home to us the
magnificent thoroughness with which Rome did her
work. Cilurnum stood on a pure and perennial stream,
the North Tyne, with a massively-fortified bridge, and
thus could never be cut off from water; it was only
some six acres in total area; yet in addition to the
river it received a water supply which would now be
thought sufficient for a fair-sized town.<a name="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> Well may
Dr. Hodgkin say that &quot;not even the Coliseum of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page212" id="page212">[212]</a></span>
Vespasian or the Pantheon of Agrippa impresses the
mind with a sense of the majestic strength of Rome so

passage of a &quot;little British stream, unknown to the

<p><i>Death of Severus&mdash;Caracalla and Geta&mdash;Roman citizenship&mdash;Extended to veterans&mdash;<i>Tabulae<br />

<br />
<p>G.I.&mdash;This mighty work kept Severus in Britain
for the rest of his life. He incessantly watched over
its progress, and not till it was completed turned his
steps once more (A.D. 211) towards Rome. But he
was not to reach the Imperial city alive. Scarcely had
he completed the first stage of the journey than, at
York, omens of fatal import foretold his speedy death.
A negro soldier presented him with a cypress crown,
exclaiming, &quot;<i>Totum vicisti, totum fuisti. Nunc Deus
esto victor</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a> When he would fain offer a sacrifice of
thanksgiving, he found himself by mistake at the dark
temple of Bellona; and her black victims were led in
his train even to the very door of his palace, which he
never left again. Dark rumours were circulated that
Caracalla, who had already once attempted his father's
<span class="newpage"><a name="page213" id="page213">[213]</a></span>
life, and was already intriguing with his stepmother,
was at the bottom of all this, and took good care that
the auguries should be fulfilled. Anyhow, Severus
never left York till his corpse was carried forth and
sent off for burial at Rome. With his last breath he
is said solemnly to have warned &quot;my Antonines&quot;
that upon their own conduct depended the peace and
well-being of the Empire which he had so ably won
for them.<a name="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a></p>

<p>G. 2.&mdash;The warning was, as usual, in vain. Caracalla
and Julia were now free to work their will, and,
having speedily got rid of her son Geta, entered upon
an incestuous marriage. The very Caledonians, whose
conjugal system was of the loosest,<a name="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a> cried shame;<a name="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a>
but the garrison of the Wall which kept them off was,
as we have seen, officered by Julia's creatures, and all
beyond it was definitely abandoned,<a name="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a> not to be recovered
for two centuries.<a name="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a> The guilty pair returned to
Rome, and a hundred and thirty years elapsed before
another Augustus visited Britain.<a name="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p>G. 3.&mdash;They left behind them no longer a subject
race of mere provincials, but a nation of full Roman
citizens. For it was Caracalla, seemingly, who, by
extending it to the whole Roman world, put the final
stroke to the expansion, which had long been in
progress, of this once priceless privilege; with its right
of appeal to Caesar, of exemption from torture, of
recognized marriage, and of eligibility to public office.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page214" id="page214">[214]</a></span>
Originally confined strictly to natives of Rome and of
Roman Colonies, it was early bestowed <i>ipso facto</i> on
enfranchised slaves, and sometimes given as a compliment
to distinguished strangers. After the Social
War (B.C. 90) it was extended to all Italians, and
Claudius (A.D. 50) allowed Messalina to make it
purchasable (&quot;for a great sum,&quot; as both the Acts
of the Apostles and Dion Cassius inform us) by
provincials.</p>

<p>G. 4.&mdash;And they could also earn it by service in
the Imperial armies. A bronze tablet, found at
Cilurnum,<a name="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a> sets forth that Antoninus Pius confers
upon the <i>emeriti</i>, or time-expired veterans, of the
Gallic, Asturian, Celtiberian, Spanish, and Dacian
cohorts in Britain, who have completed twenty-five
years' service with the colours, the right of Roman
citizenship, and legalizes their marriages, whether
existing or future.<a name="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a> As there is no reason to suppose
that such discharged soldiers commonly returned to
their native land, this system must have leavened the
population of Britain with a considerable proportion
of Roman citizens, even before Caracalla's edict.
Besides its privileges, this freedom brought with it
certain liabilities, pecuniary and other; and it was to
extend the area of these that Caracalla took this
apparently liberal step, which had been at least

<br />
<p>A. 1.&mdash;After the death of Severus in A.D. 211,
Roman historians tell us nothing more concerning
Britain till we come to the rise of the only other
Emperor who died at York, Constantius Chlorus.
During the miserable period which the wickedness of
Caracalla brought upon the Roman world, when
Pretender after Pretender flits across the scene, most
to fail, some for a moment to succeed, but all alike
to end their brief course in blood, our island remained
fairly quiet. The Army of Britain made one or two
futile pronunciamentos (the least unsuccessful being
those for Postumus in A.D. 258, and Victorinus in
A.D. 265), and in 277 the Emperor Probus, probably
to keep it in check, leavened it with a large force
<span class="newpage"><a name="page219" id="page219">[219]</a></span>
recruited from amongst his Vandal prisoners,<a name="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a> whose
name may, perhaps, still survive in Vandlebury
Camp, on the Gog-Magog<a name="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a> Hills, near Cambridge.
But not till the energy and genius of Diocletian
began to bring back to order the chaos into which
the Roman world had fallen does Britain play any
real part in the higher politics.</p>

<p>A. 2.&mdash;Then, however, we suddenly find ourselves
confronted with names destined to exert a supreme
influence on the future of our land. The Saxons
from the Elbe, and the Franks from the Rhine had
already begun their pirate raids along the coasts to
the westwards.<a name="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a> Each tribe derived its name from
its peculiar national weapon (the Franks from their
throwing-axe (<i>franca</i>),<a name="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a> the Saxons from the <i>saexes</i>,
long murderous knives, snouted like a Norwegian
knife of the present day, which they used with such
deadly effect);<a name="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> and their appearance constituted a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page220" id="page220">[220]</a></span>
new and fearful danger to the Roman Empire.
Never, since the Mediterranean pirates were crushed
by Pompey (B.C. 66) had it been exposed to attacks
by sea. A special effort was needed to meet this new
situation, and we find, accordingly, a new officer now
added to the Imperial muster,&mdash;the Count of the
Saxon Shore. His jurisdiction extended over the
northern coast of Gaul and the southern and eastern
shores of Britain, the head-quarters of his fleet being
at Boulogne.</p>

<p>A. 3.&mdash;The first man to be placed in this position
was Carausius,<a name="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a> a Frisian adventurer of low birth, but
great military reputation, to which unfortunately he
proved unequal. When his command was not followed
by the looked-for putting-down of the pirate raiders,
he was suspected, probably with truth, of a secret
understanding with them. The Government accordingly
sent down orders for his execution, to which he
replied (A.D. 286) by open rebellion, took the pirate
fleets into his pay, and having thus got the undisputed
command of the sea, succeeded in maintaining
himself as Emperor in Britain for the rest of
his life.</p>

<p>A. 4.&mdash;His reign and that of his successor (and
murderer) Allectus are marked by the last and most
extraordinary development of Romano-British coinage.
Since the time of Caracalla no coins which can
be definitely proved to deserve this name are found;
but now, in less than ten years, our mints struck no
fewer than five hundred several issues, all of different
<span class="newpage"><a name="page221" id="page221">[221]</a></span>
types. Nearly all are of bronze, with the radiated
head of the Emperor on the obverse, and on the
reverse devices of every imaginable kind. The
British Lion once more figures, as in the days of
Cymbeline; and we have also the Roman Wolf, the
Sea-horse, the Cow (as a symbol of Prosperity),
Plenty, Peace, Victory, Prudence, Health, Safety,
Might, Good Luck, Glory, all symbolized in various
ways. But the favourite type of all is the British
warship; for now Britannia, for the first time, ruled
the waves, and was, indeed, so entirely Mistress of
the Sea that her fleet appeared even in Mediterranean
waters.<a name="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322"><sup>[322]</sup></a> The vessels figured are invariably not
Saxon &quot;keels,&quot; but classical galleys, with their rams
and outboard rowing galleries, and are always represented
as cleared for action (when the great mainsail
and its yard were left on shore).</p>

<p>A. 5.&mdash;The usurpation of Carausius, &quot;the pirate,&quot;
as the Imperial panegyrists called him,<a name="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323"><sup>[323]</sup></a> brought
Diocletian's great reform of the Roman administration
within the scope of practical politics in Britain. The old
system of Provinces, some Imperial, some Senatorial,
with each Pro-praetor or Pro-consul responsible only and
immediately to the central government at Rome, had
obviously become outgrown. And the Provinces
themselves were much too large. Diocletian accordingly
began by dividing the Empire into four &quot;Prefectures,&quot;
two in the east and two in the west. Each
<span class="newpage"><a name="page222" id="page222">[222]</a></span>
pair was to be under one of the co-Augusti, who
again was to entrust one of his Prefectures to the
&quot;Caesar&quot;<a name="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324"><sup>[324]</sup></a> or heir-apparent of his choice. Thus
Diocletian held the East, while Galerius, his &quot;Caesar,&quot;
took the Prefecture of Illyricum. His colleague Maximian,
as Augustus of the West, ruled in Italy; and the
remaining Prefecture, that of &quot;the Gauls,&quot; fell to the
Western Caesar, Constantius Chlorus. Each Prefecture,
again, was divided into &quot;Dioceses&quot; (that of
Constantius containing those of Britain, Gaul, Spain,
and Mauretania), each under a &quot;Vicar,&quot; and comprising
a certain number of &quot;Provinces&quot; (that of
Britain having four). Thus a regular hierarchy with
rank above rank of responsibility was established,
and so firmly that Diocletian's system lasted (so far
as provincial government was concerned) till the very
latest days of the Roman dominion.</p>

<p>A. 6.&mdash;When Constantius thus became Caesar of
the West, his first task was to restore Britain to the
Imperial system. He was already, it seems, connected
with the island, and had married a British lady named
Helen.<a name="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> Their son Constantine, a youth of special
promise (according to the panegyrists), had been born
at York, about A.D. 274, and now appeared on the scene
to aid his father's operations with supernatural speed,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page223" id="page223">[223]</a></span>
&quot;<i>quasi divino quodam curriculo</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a> Extraordinary
celerity, indeed, marked all these operations. Allectus
was on his guard, with one squadron at Boulogne to
sweep the coast of Gaul, and another cruising in the
Channel. By a sudden dash Constantius [in A.D.
296] seized the mouth of Boulogne harbour, threw
a boom across it, &quot;<i>defixis in aditu trabibus</i>,&quot; and
effectually barred the pirates from access to the sea.<a name="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a>
Meanwhile the fleet which he had been building
simultaneously in various Gallic ports was able to
rendezvous undisturbed at Havre.</p>

<p>A. 7.&mdash;His men were no expert mariners like their
adversaries; and, for this very reason, were ready,
with their Caesar at their head, to put to sea in
threatening weather, which made their better-skilled
pilots hesitate. &quot;What can we fear?&quot; was the cry,
&quot;Caesar is with us.&quot; Dropping down the Seine with
the tide on a wild and rainy morning, they set sail
with a cross wind, probably from the north-east, a
rare thing with ancient ships. As they neared the
British coast the breeze sank to a dead calm, with a
heavy mist lying on the waveless sea, in which the
fleet found it impossible to keep together. One
division, with Constantius himself on board, made
their land-fall somewhere in the west, perhaps at
Exeter, the other far to the east, possibly at
Richborough.</p>

<p>A. 8.&mdash;But the wonderful luck which attended
Constantius, and on which his panegyrists specially
<span class="newpage"><a name="page224" id="page224">[224]</a></span>
dwell, made all turn out for the best. The mist
enabled both his divisions to escape the notice of
the British fleet, which was lying off the Isle of
Wight on the watch for him; and the unexpected
landing at two such distant points utterly demoralized
the usurper. Of the large force which had been
mustered for land defence, only the Frankish auxiliaries
could be got together in time to meet Constantius&mdash;who,
having burnt his ships (for his only
hope now lay in victory), was marching, with his
wonted speed, straight on London. One battle,<a name="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a> in
which scarcely a single Roman fell on the British
side, was enough; the corpse of Allectus [<i>ipse vexillarius
latrocinii</i>] was found, stripped of the Imperial
insignia, amongst the heaps of slain barbarians, and
the routed Franks fled to London. Here, while they
were engaged in sacking the city before evacuating
it, they were set upon by the eastern division of the
Roman army (under Asclepiodotus the Praetorian
Prefect)<a name="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a> and slaughtered almost to a man. The
rescued metropolis eagerly welcomed its deliverers,
and the example was followed by the rest of Britain;
the more readily that the few surviving Franks were
distributed throughout the land to perish in the
provincial amphitheatres.</p>

<p>A. 9.&mdash;The Diocletian system was now introduced;
<span class="newpage"><a name="page225" id="page225">[225]</a></span>
and, instead of Hadrian's old divisions of Upper and
Lower Britain, the island south of his Wall was
distributed into four Provinces, &quot;Britannia Prima,&quot;
&quot;Britannia Secunda,&quot; &quot;Maxima Caesariensis,&quot; and
&quot;Flavia Caesariensis.&quot; That the Thames, the Severn,
and the Humber formed the frontier lines between
these new divisions is probable. But their identification,
in the current maps of Roman Britain, with the
later Wessex, Wales, Northumbria, and Mercia (with
East Anglia), respectively, is purely conjectural.<a name="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a> All
that we know is that when the district between
Hadrian's Wall and Agricola's Rampart was reconquered
in 369, it was made a fifth British Province
under the name Valentia. The Governor of each
Province exercised his functions under the &quot;Vicar&quot;
of the &quot;Diocese,&quot; an official of &quot;Respectable&quot;
rank&mdash;the second in precedence of the Diocletian
hierarchy (exclusive of the Imperial Family).</p>

<p>A. 10.&mdash;With the Diocletian administration necessarily
came the Diocletian Persecution&mdash;an essential
feature of the situation. There is no reason to imagine
that the great reforming Emperor had, like his colleague
Maximian, any personal hatred for Christianity. But
Christianity was not among the <i>religiones licitae</i>
of the Empire. Over and over again it had been pronounced
<span class="newpage"><a name="page226" id="page226">[226]</a></span>
by Imperial Rescript unlawful. This being so, Diocletian
saw in its toleration merely one of those corruptions
of lax government which it was his special mission to
sweep away, and proceeded to deal with it as with any
other abuse,&mdash;to be put down with whole-hearted vigour
and rigour.</p>

<p>A. 11.&mdash;The Faith had by this time everywhere
become so widespread that the good-will of its
professors was a political power to be reckoned with.
Few of the passing Pretenders of the Era of Confusion
had dared to despise it, some had even courted
it; and thus throughout the Empire the Christian
hierarchy had been established, and Christian churches
been built everywhere; while Christians swarmed in
every department of the Imperial service,&mdash;their
neglect of the official worship winked at, while they,
in turn, were not vigorous in rebuking the idolatry
of their heathen fellow-servants. Now all was changed.
The sacred edifices were thrown down, or (as in the
famous case of St. Clement's at Rome) made over
for heathen worship, the sacred books and vessels
destroyed, and every citizen, however humble, had to
produce a <i>libellus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a> or magisterial certificate,
testifying that he had formally done homage to the Gods of
the State, by burning incense at their shrines, by
pouring libations in their name, and by partaking of
the victims sacrificed upon their altars. Torture and
death were the lot of all recusants; and to the noble
army of martyrs who now sealed their testimony with
<span class="newpage"><a name="page227" id="page227">[227]</a></span>
their blood Britain is said (by Gildas) to have
contributed a contingent of no fewer than seventeen
thousand, headed by St. Alban at Verulam.</p>

<p>A. 12.&mdash;So thorough-going a persecution the Church
had never known. But it came too late for Diocletian's
purpose; and it was probably the latent consciousness
of his failure that impelled him, in 305, to resign the
purple and retire to his cabbage-garden at Dyrrhachium.
Maximian found himself unwillingly obliged to retire
likewise; and the two Caesars, Galerius and Constantius,
became, by the operation of the new constitution,
<i>ipso facto</i> Augusti.</p>

<p>A. 13.&mdash;But already the mutual jealousy and
distrust in which that constitution was so soon to
perish began to manifest themselves. Galerius, though
properly only Emperor of the East, seized on Rome,
and with it on the person of the young Constantine,
whom he hoped to keep as hostage for his father's
submission. The youth, however, contrived to flee,
and post down to join Constantius in Gaul, slaughtering
every stud of relays along the entire road to delay
his pursuers. Both father and son at once sailed for
Britain, where the former shortly died, like Severus,
at York. With their arrival the persecution promptly
ceased;<a name="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a> for Helena, at least, was an ardent Christian,
and her husband well-affected to the Faith. Yet, on
his death, he was, like his predecessors, proclaimed
<i>Divus</i>; the last formal bestowal of that title being
thus, like the first,<a name="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333"><sup>[333]</sup></a> specially connected with Britain.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page228" id="page228">[228]</a></span>
Constantius was buried, according to Nennius,<a name="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> at
Segontium, wherever that may have been; and
Constantine, though not yet even a Caesar, was at
once proclaimed by the soldiers (at his native York)
Augustus in his father's room.</p>

<p>A. 14.&mdash;This was the signal for a whole outburst of
similar proclamations all over the Roman world,
Licinius, Constantine's brother-in-law, declared himself
Emperor at Carnutum, Maxentius, son of Maximian
and son-in-law of Galerius, in Rome, Severus in the
Illyrian provinces, and Maximin (who had been a
Caesar) in Syria. Galerius still reigned, and even
Maximian revoked his resignation and appeared once
more as Augustus. But one by one this medley of
Pretenders swept each other away, and the survival
of the fittest was exemplified by the final victory of
Constantine over them all. For a few years he bided
his time, and then, at the head of the British army,
marched on Rome. Clear-sighted enough to perceive
that events were irresistibly tending to the triumph of
Christianity, he declared himself the champion of the
Faith; and it was not under the Roman Eagle, but
the Banner of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a> that his soldiers fought and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page229" id="page229">[229]</a></span>
won. Coins of his found in Britain, bearing the
Sacred Monogram which led his men to the crowning
victory of 312 at the Milvian Bridge (the intertwined
letters &#935; [<b>Chi</b>] and &#929; [<b>Rho</b>] between &#913; [<b>Alpha</b>] and
&#937; [<b>Omega</b>], the whole forming the word &#935;&#929;&#913;&#937; [<b>ARCh&Ocirc;</b>], &quot;I reign&quot;),
with the motto <i>Hoc Signo Victor Eris</i>, testify to the special
part taken by our country in the establishment of our Faith as the
officially recognized religion of Rome,&mdash;that is to say, of the whole
civilized world. And henceforward, as long as Britain remained Roman
at all, it was a monarch of British connection who occupied the
Imperial throne. The dynasties of Constantius, Valentinian, and
Theodosius, who between them (with the brief interlude of the reign
of Julian) fill the next 150 years (300-450), were all markedly
associated with our island. So, indeed, was Julian also.</p>

<p>B. 1.&mdash;For a whole generation after the triumph
of Constantine tranquillity reigned in Britain. The
ruined Christian churches were everywhere restored,
and new ones built; and in Britain, as elsewhere, the
Gospel spread rapidly and widely&mdash;the more so that
the Church here was but little troubled<a name="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a> by the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page230" id="page230">[230]</a></span>
desperate struggle with Arianism which was convulsing
the East. Britain, as Athanasius tells us, gave an
assenting vote to the decisions of Nicaea (&#963;&#8059;&#956;&#968;&#951;&#966;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#964;&#8059;&#947;&#967;&#945;&#957;&#949;) [<b>sumps&ecirc;phos
etunchane</b>], and British Bishops actually sat in the
Councils of Arles (314) and of Ariminum (360).</p>

<p>B. 2.&mdash;The old heathen worship still continued side
by side with the new Faith; but signs soon appeared
that the Church would tolerate no such rivalry when
once her power was equal to its suppression. Julius
Firmicus (who wrote against &quot;Profane Religions&quot;
in 343) implores the sons of Constantine to continue
their good work of stripping the temples and melting
down the images;&mdash;in special connection with a visit
paid by them that year to Britain<a name="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a> (our last Imperial
visit), when they had actually been permitted to cross
the Channel in winter-time; an irrefragable proof of
Heaven's approval of their iconoclasm. It is highly
probable that they pursued here also a course at once
so pious and so profitable, and that the fanes of the
ancient deities but lingered on in poverty and neglect
till finally suppressed by Theodosius (A.D. 390).</p>

<p>B. 3.&mdash;And now Britain resumed her <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of
Emperor-maker.<a name="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> After the death of Constans,
(A.D. 350), Magnentius, an officer in the Gallic army
of British birth, set up as Augustus, and was supported
by Gratian, the leader of the Army of Britain, and by
his son Valentinian. Magnentius himself had his
<span class="newpage"><a name="page231" id="page231">[231]</a></span>
capital at Treves, and for three years reigned over the
whole Prefecture of the Gauls. He professed a
special zeal for orthodoxy, and was the first to
introduce burning, as the appropriate punishment for
heresy, into the penal code of Christendom. Meanwhile
his colleague Decentius advanced against
Constantius, and was defeated, at Nursa on the
Drave, with such awful slaughter that the old Roman
Legions never recovered from the shock. Henceforward
the name signifies a more or less numerous
body, more or less promiscuously armed, such as we
find so many of in the 'Notitia.' Magnentius, in turn,
was slain (A.D. 353), and the supreme command in
Britain passed to the new Caesar of the West, Julian
&quot;the Apostate.&quot;</p>

<p>B. 4.&mdash;Under him we first find our island mentioned
as one of the great corn-growing districts of
the Empire, on which Gaul was able to draw to a
very large extent for the supply of her garrisons. No
fewer than eight hundred wheat-ships sailed from our
shores on this errand; a number which shows how
large an area of the island must have been brought
under cultivation, and how much the country had
prospered during the sixty years of unbroken internal
peace which had followed on the suppression of
Allectus.</p>

<p>B. 5.&mdash;That peace was now to be broken up. The
northern tribes had by this recovered from the awful
chastisement inflicted upon them by Severus,<a name="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a> and,
after an interval of 150 years, once more (A.D. 362)
<span class="newpage"><a name="page232" id="page232">[232]</a></span>
appeared south of Hadrian's Wall. Whether as yet
they <i>burst through</i> it is uncertain; for now we find a
new confederacy of barbarians. It is no longer that
of Caledonians and Meatae, but of Picts and Scots.
And these last were seafarers. Their home was not
in Britain at all, but in the north of Ireland. In their
&quot;skiffs&quot;<a name="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> they were able to turn the flank of the
Roman defences, and may well have thus introduced
their allies from beyond Solway also. Anyhow,
penetrate the united hordes did into the quiet cornfields
of Roman Britain, repeating their raids ever more frequently
and extending them ever more widely, till their spearmen
were cut [Errata: to] pieces in 450 at Stamford by the
swords of the newly-arrived English.<a name="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a></p>

<p>B. 6.&mdash;For the moment they were driven back
without much difficulty, by Lupicinus, Julian's Legate
(the first Legate we hear of in Britain since Lollius
Urbicus), who, when the death of Constantius II. (in
361) had extinguished that royal line, aided his master
to become &quot;<i>Dominus totius orbis</i>&quot;&mdash;as he is called in
an inscription<a name="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a> describing his triumphant campaigns
&quot;<i>ex oceano Britannico</i>.&quot; And after &quot;the victory of the
Galilaean&quot; (363) had ended Julian's brief and futile
<span class="newpage"><a name="page233" id="page233">[233]</a></span>
attempt to restore the Higher Paganism (to which
several British inscriptions testify),<a name="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a> it was again to
an Emperor from Britain that there fell the Lordship
of the World&mdash;Valentinian, son of Gratian, whose
dynasty lasted out the remaining century of Romano-British
history.</p>

<p>B. 7.&mdash;His reign was marked in our land by a life-and-death
struggle with the inrushing barbarians. The
Picts and Scots were now joined by yet another tribe,
the cannibal<a name="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a> Attacotti<a name="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a> of Valentia, and their invasions
were facilitated by the simultaneous raids of the
Saxon pirates (with whom they may perhaps have
been actually in concert) along the coast. The whole
land had been wasted, and more than one Roman
general defeated, when Theodosius, father of the Great
Emperor, was sent, in 368, to the rescue. Crossing
from Boulogne to Richborough in a lucky calm,<a name="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a> and
fixing his head-quarters at London, or Augusta, as
it was now called [<i>Londinium vetus oppidum, quod
Augustam posteritas apellavit</i>], he first, by a
skilful combination of flying columns, cut to pieces
the scattered hordes of the savages as they were making off
with their booty, and finally not only drove them back
beyond the Wall, which he repaired and re-garrisoned,<a name="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page234" id="page234">[234]</a></span>
but actually recovered the district right up to Agricola's
rampart, which had been barbarian soil ever since the
days of Severus.<a name="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348"><sup>[348]</sup></a> It was now (369) formed into a
fifth British province, and named Valentia in honour
of Valens, the brother and colleague of the Emperor.</p>

<p>B. 8.&mdash;The Twentieth Legion, whose head-quarters
had so long been at Chester, seems to have been
moved to guard this new province. Forty years later
Claudian speaks of it as holding the furthest outposts
in Britain, in his well-known description of the dying
Pict:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
&quot;Venit et extremis legio praetenta Britannis,<br />
Quae Scoto dat frena truci, ferroque notatas<br />
Perlegit exsangues Picto moriente figuras.&quot;<br />
<br />
[&quot;From Britain's bound the outpost legion came,<br />
Which curbs the savage Scot, and fading sees<br />
The steel-wrought figures on the dying Pict.&quot;]<br />
</div>

<p>The same poet makes Theodosius fight and conquer
even in the Orkneys and in Ireland;</p>

<div class="blkquot">
&quot;&mdash;maduerunt Saxone fuso<br />
Orcades; incaluit Pictorum sanguine Thule;<br />
Scotorum cumulos flevit glacialis Ierne.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a><br />
<br />
[&quot;With Saxon slaughter flowed the Orkney strand,<br />
With Pictish blood cold Thule warmer grew;<br />
And icy Erin wept her Scotchmen slain.&quot;]<br />
</div>

<p>The relief, however, was but momentary. Five years
later (374) another great Saxon raid is recorded; yet
eight years more and the Picts and Scots have again
to be driven from the land; and in the next decade
their attacks became incessant.</p>

Alaric&mdash;Collapse of Roman rule in Britain.</i></p>

<p>C. 1.&mdash;By this time the evacuation of Britain
by the Roman soldiery had fairly begun. Maximus,
the last victor over the Scots, the &quot;Pirate of
Richborough,&quot; as Ausonius calls him, set up as Emperor
(A.D. 383); and the Army of Britain again marched on
Rome, and again, as under Constantine, brought its
leader in triumph to the Capitol (A.D. 387). But this
time it did not return. When Maximus was defeated
and slain (A.D. 388) at Aquileia by the Imperial
brothers-in-law Valentinian II. and Theodosius the
Great<a name="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a> (sons of the so-named leaders connected with
Britain), his soldiers, as they retreated homewards,
straggled on the march; settling, amid the general
confusion, here and there, mostly in Armorica, which
now first began to be called Brittany.<a name="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351"><sup>[351]</sup></a> This tale rests
only on the authority of Nennius, but it is far from
improbable, especially as his sequel&mdash;that a fresh
legion dispatched to Britain by Stilicho (in 396) once
more repelled the Picts and Scots, and re-secured the
Wall&mdash;is confirmed by Claudian, who makes Britain
<span class="newpage"><a name="page236" id="page236">[236]</a></span>
(in a sea-coloured cloak and bearskin head-gear) hail
Stilicho as her deliverer:</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>Inde Caledonio velata Britannia monstro,
Ferro picta genas, cujus vestigia verrit
Coerulus, Oceanique aestum mentitur, amictus:
&quot;Me quoque vicinis percuntem gentibus,&quot; inquit,
&quot;Munivit Stilichon, totam quum Scotus Iernen
Movit, et infesto spumavit remige Tethys.
Illius effectum curis, ne tela timerem
Scotica, ne Pictum tremerem, ne litore toto
Prospicerem dubiis venturum Saxona ventis.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352"><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

<p>[Then next, with Caledonian bearskin cowled,
Her cheek steel-tinctured, and her trailing robe
Of green-shot blue, like her own Ocean's tide,
Britannia spake: &quot;Me too,&quot; she cried, &quot;in act
To perish 'mid the shock of neighbouring hordes,
Did Stilicho defend, when the wild Scot
All Erin raised against me, and the wave
Foamed 'neath the stroke of many a foeman's oar.
So wrought his pains that now I fear no more
Those Scottish darts, nor tremble at the Pict,
Nor mark, where'er to sea mine eyes I turn,
The Saxon coming on each shifting wind.&quot;]</p></div>

<p>C. 2.&mdash;Which legion it was which Stilicho sent to
Britain is much more questionable. The Roman
legions were seldom moved from province to province,
and it is perhaps more probable that he
filled up the three quartered in the island to something
like their proper strength. But a crisis was
now at hand which broke down all ordinary rules.
Rome was threatened with such a danger as she had
not known since Marius, five hundred years before,
had destroyed the Cimbri and Teutones (B.C. 101).
A like horde of Teutonic invaders, nearly half a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page237" id="page237">[237]</a></span>
million strong, came pouring over the Alps, under
&quot;Radagaisus the Goth,&quot; as contemporary historians
call him, though his claim, to Gothic lineage is not
undisputed. And these were not, like Alaric and
his Visigoths, who were to reap the fruits of this
effort, semi-civilized Christians, but heathen savages
of the most ferocious type. Every nerve had to be
strained to crush them; and Stilicho did crush them.
But it was at a fearful cost. Every Roman soldier
within reach had to be swept to the rescue, and thus
the Rhine frontier was left defenceless against the
barbarian hordes pressing upon it. Vandals, Sueves,
Alans, Franks, Burgundians, rushed tumultuously
over the peaceful and fertile fields of Gaul, never to
be driven forth again.</p>

<p>C. 3.&mdash;Of the three British legions one only seems
to have been thus withdrawn,&mdash;the Twentieth, whose
head-quarters had been so long at Chester, and whose
more recent duty had been to garrison the outlying
province of Valentia, which may now perhaps have
been again abandoned. It seems to have been
actually on the march towards Italy<a name="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353"><sup>[353]</sup></a> when there was
drawn up that wonderful document which gives us
our last and completest glimpse of Roman Britain&mdash;the
<i>Notitia Dignitatum Utriusque Imperii</i>.</p>

<p>C. 4.&mdash;This invaluable work sets forth in detail the
whole machinery of the Imperial Government, its
official hierarchy, both civil and military, in every
land, and a summary of the forces under the authority
<span class="newpage"><a name="page238" id="page238">[238]</a></span>
of each commander. A reference in Claudian would
seem to show that it was compiled by the industry of
Celerinus, the <i>Primicerius Notariorum</i> or Head Clerk
of the Treasury. The poet tells us how this indefatigable
statistician&mdash;</p>

<div class="blkquot">&quot;Cunctorum tabulas assignat honorum,<br />

<p>To us the 'Notitia' is only known by the 16th-century
copies of a 10th-century MS. which has now disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a>
But these were made with exceptional care,
and are as nearly as may be facsimiles of the original,
even preserving its illuminated illustrations, including
the distinctive insignia of every corps in the Roman
Army.</p>

<p>C. 5.&mdash;The number of these corps had, we find,
grown erormously since the days of Hadrian, when,
as Dion Cassius tells us, there were 19 &quot;Civic Legions&quot;
(of which three were quartered in Britain). No
fewer than 132 are now enumerated, together with
<span class="newpage"><a name="page239" id="page239">[239]</a></span>
108 auxiliary bodies. But we may be sure that each
of these &quot;legions&quot; was not the complete Army
Corps of old,<a name="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356"><sup>[356]</sup></a> though possibly the 25 of the First
Class, the <i>Legiones Palatinae</i>, may have kept something
of their ancient effectiveness. Indeed it is not
wholly improbable that these alone represent the old
&quot;civil&quot; army; the Second and Third Class &quot;legions,&quot;
with their extraordinary names (&quot;Comitatenses&quot; and
&quot;Pseudo-Comitatenses&quot;), being indeed merely so
called by &quot;courtesy,&quot; or even &quot;sham courtesy.&quot;</p>

<p>C. 6.&mdash;In Britain we find the two remaining legions
of the old garrison, the Second, now quartered not at
Caerleon but at Richborough, under the Count of the
Saxon Shore, and the Sixth under the &quot;Duke of the
Britains,&quot; holding the north (with its head-quarters
doubtless, as of yore, at York, though this is not
mentioned). Along with each legion are named ten
&quot;squads&quot; [<i>numeri</i>], which may perhaps represent
the ten cohorts into which legions were of old divided.
The word cohort seems to have changed its meaning,
and now to signify an independent military unit under
a &quot;Tribune.&quot; Eighteen of these, together with six
squadrons [<i>alae</i>] of cavalry, each commanded by a
&quot;Praefect,&quot; form the garrison of the Wall;&mdash;a separate
organization, though, like the rest of the northern
forces, under the Duke of the Britains. The ten
squads belonging to the Sixth Legion (each under a
Prefect) are distributed in garrison throughout Yorkshire,
Lancashire, and Westmoreland. Those of the
Second (each commanded by a &quot;Praepositus&quot;) are
<span class="newpage"><a name="page240" id="page240">[240]</a></span>
partly under the Count of the Saxon Shore, holding
the coast from the Wash to Arundel,<a name="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357"><sup>[357]</sup></a> partly under
the &quot;Count of Britain,&quot; who was probably the senior
officer in the island<a name="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358"><sup>[358]</sup></a> and responsible for its defence
in general. Besides these bodies of infantry the
British Army comprised eighteen cavalry units; three,
besides the six on the Wall, being in the north, three
on the Saxon Shore, and the remaining six under the
immediate command of the Count of Britain, to
whose troops no special quarters are assigned. Not
a single station is mentioned beyond the Wall, which
supports the theory that the withdrawal of the Twentieth
Legion had involved the practical abandonment of
Valentia.<a name="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359"><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p>C. 7.&mdash;The two Counts and the Duke were the
military leaders of Britain. The chief civil officer was
the &quot;respectable&quot; Vicar of the Diocese of Britain, one
of the six Vicars under the &quot;illustrious&quot; Pro-consul of
Africa. Under him were the Governors of the five
Provinces, two of these being &quot;Consulars&quot; of
&quot;Right Renowned&quot; rank [<i>clarissimi</i>,] the other three
&quot;Right Perfect&quot; [<i>perfectissimi</i>] &quot;Presidents.&quot; The
Vicar was assisted by a staff of Civil Servants, nine
<span class="newpage"><a name="page241" id="page241">[241]</a></span>
heads of departments being enumerated. Their
names, however, have become so wholly obsolete as
to tell us nothing of their respective functions.</p>

<p>C. 8.&mdash;Whatever these may have been they did not
include the financial administration of the Diocese,
the general management of which was in the hands of
two officers, the &quot;Accountant of Britain&quot; [<i>Rationalis
Summarum Britanniarum</i>] and the &quot;Provost of the
London Treasury&quot; [<i>Praepositus thesaurorum Augustensium</i>].<a name="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360"><sup>[360]</sup></a>
Both these were subordinates of the &quot;Count
of the Sacred Largesses&quot; [<i>Comes Sacrarum Largitionum</i>],
one of the greatest officers of State, corresponding
to our First Lord of the Treasury, whose name
reminds us that all public expenditure was supposed
to be the personal benevolence of His Sacred Majesty
the Emperor, and all sources of public revenue his
personal property. The Emperor, however, had
actually in every province domains of his own, managed
by the Count of the Privy Purse [<i>Comes Rei
Privatae</i>], whose subordinate in Britain was entitled
the &quot;Accountant of the Privy Purse for Britain&quot;
[<i>Rationalis Rei Privatae per Britanniam</i>]. Both these
Counts were &quot;Illustrious&quot; [<i>illustres</i>]; that is, of the
highest order of the Imperial peerage below the
&quot;Right Noble&quot; [<i>nobilissimi</i>] members of the Imperial
Family.</p>

<p>C. 9.&mdash;Such and so complete was the system of
civil and military government in Roman Britain up to
the very point of its sudden and utter collapse. When
<span class="newpage"><a name="page242" id="page242">[242]</a></span>
the 'Notitia' was compiled, neither Celerinus, as he
wrote, nor the officials whose functions and ranks he
noted, could have dreamt that within ten short years
the whole elaborate fabric would, so far as Britain was
concerned, be swept away utterly and for ever. Yet
so it was.</p>

<p>C. 10.&mdash;For what was left of the British Army now
made a last effort to save the West for Rome, and
once more set up Imperial Pretenders of its own.<a name="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361"><sup>[361]</sup></a>
The first two of these, Marcus and Gratian, were
speedily found unequal to the post, and paid the
usual penalty of such incompetence; but the third, a
private soldier named Constantine, all but succeeded
in emulating the triumph of his great namesake. For
four years (407-411) he was able to hold not only
Britain, but Gaul and Spain also under his sceptre;
and the wretched Honorius, the unworthy son and
successor of Theodosius, who was cowering amid the
marshes of Ravenna, and had murdered his champion
Stilicho, was fain to recognize the usurper as a legitimate
Augustus. Only by treachery was he put down
at last, the traitor being the commander of his British
forces, Gerontius. Both names continued for many
an age favourites in British nomenclature, and both
have been swept into the cycle of Arturian romance,
the latter as &quot;Geraint.&quot;</p>

<p>C. 11.&mdash;Neither Gerontius nor his soldiers ever got
back to their old homes in Britain. What became of
them we do not know. But Zosimus<a name="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362"><sup>[362]</sup></a> tells us that
<span class="newpage"><a name="page243" id="page243">[243]</a></span>
Honorius now sent a formal rescript to the British
cities abrogating the Lex Julia, which forbade
civilians to carry arms, and bidding them look to their
own safety. For now the end had really come, and
the Eternal City itself had been sacked by barbarian
hands. Never before and never since does history
record a sacked city so mildly treated by the conquerors.
Heretics as the Visi-goths were, they never
forgot that the vanquished Catholics were their fellow-Christians,
and, barbarians as they were, they left an
example of mercy in victory which puts to the blush
much more recent Christian and civilized warfare.</p>

<p>C. 12.&mdash;But, for all that, the moral effect of
Alaric's capture of Rome was portentous, and shook
the very foundations of civilization throughout the
world. To Jerome, in his cell at Bethlehem, the
tidings came like the shock of an earthquake.
Augustine, as he penned his 'De Civitate Dei,' felt
the old world ended indeed, and the Kingdom of
Heaven indeed at hand. And in Britain the whole
elaborate system of Imperial civil and military
government seems to have crumbled to the ground
almost at once. It is noticeable that the rescript of
Honorius is addressed simply to &quot;the cities&quot; of
Britain, the local municipal officers of each several
place. No higher authority remained. The Vicar of
Britain, with his staff, the Count and Duke of the
Britains with their soldiery, the Count of the Saxon
Shore with his coastguard,&mdash;all were gone. It is possible
that, as the deserted provincials learnt to combine
for defence, the Dictators they chose from time to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page244" id="page244">[244]</a></span>
time to lead the national forces may have derived
some of their authority from the remembrance of these
old dignities. &quot;The dragon of the great Pendragonship,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363"><sup>[363]</sup></a>
the tufa of Caswallon (633), and the purple of
Cunedda<a name="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364"><sup>[364]</sup></a> may well have been derived (as Professor
Rhys suggests) from this source. But practically the
history of Roman Britain ends with a crash at the Fall
of Rome.</p>

<p>D. 1.&mdash;Little remains to be told, and that little rests
upon no contemporary authority known to us. In
Gildas, the nearest, writing in the next century, we
find little more than a monotonous threnody over the
awful visitation of the English Conquest, the wholesale
and utter destruction of cities, the desecration of
churches, the massacre of clergy and people. Nennius
(as, for the sake of convenience, modern writers mostly
agree to call the unknown author of the 'Historia
<span class="newpage"><a name="page245" id="page245">[245]</a></span>
Britonum') gives us legends of British incompetence
and Saxon treachery which doubtless represent the
substantial features of the break-up, and preserve,
quite possibly, even some of the details. Bede and
the 'Anglo-Saxon Chronicle' assign actual dates to the
various events, but we have no means of testing their
accuracy.</p>

<p>D. 2.&mdash;Broadly we know that the unhappy civilians,
who were not only without military experience, but
had up to this moment been actually forbidden to
carry arms, naturally proved unable to face the
ferocious enemies who swarmed in upon them. They
could neither hold the Wall against the Picts nor the
coast against the Saxons. It may well be true that
they chose a <i>Dux Britannorum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a> and that his name
may have been something like Vortigern, and that he
(when a final appeal for Roman aid proved vain)<a name="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a>
may have taken into his pay (as Carausius did) the
crews of certain pirate &quot;keels&quot; [<i>chiulae</i>],<a name="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367"><sup>[367]</sup></a> and settled
them in Thanet. The very names of their English
captains, &quot;Hengist and Horsa,&quot; may not be so mythical</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page246" id="page246">[246]</a></span>
<p>as critics commonly assume.<a name="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a> And the tale of the
victory at Stamford, when the spears of the Scottish
invaders were cut to pieces by the swords of the
English mercenaries,<a name="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369"><sup>[369]</sup></a> has a very true ring about it.
So has also the sequel, which tells how, when the
inevitable quarrel arose between employers and employed,
the Saxon leader gave the signal for the fray
by suddenly shouting to his men, <i>Nimed eure saxes</i><a name="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370"><sup>[370]</sup></a>
(<i>i.e.</i> &quot;Draw your knives!&quot;), and massacred the hapless
Britons of Kent almost without resistance.</p>

<p>D. 3.&mdash;The date of this first English settlement is
doubtful. Bede fixes it as 449, which agrees with the
order of events in Gildas, and with the notice in
Nennius that it was forty years after the end of Roman
rule in Britain [<i>transacto Romanorum in Britannia
imperio</i>]. But Nennius also declares that this was in
the fourth year of Vortigern, and that his accession
coincided with that of the nephew and successor of
Honorius, Valentinian III., son of Galla Placidia,
which would bring in the Saxons 428. It may perhaps
be some very slight confirmation of the later date, that
Valentinian is the last Emperor whose coins have been
found in Britain.<a name="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371"><sup>[371]</sup></a></p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page247" id="page247">[247]</a></span>
<p>D. 4.&mdash;Anyhow, the arrival of the successive swarms
of Anglo-Saxons from the mouth of the Elbe, and their
hard-won conquest of Eastern Britain during the 5th
century, is certain. The western half of the island,
from Clydesdale southwards, resisted much longer,
and, in spite of its long and straggling frontier, held
together for more than a century. Not till the decisive
victory of the Northumbrians at Chester (A.D.
607), and that of the West Saxons at Beandune (A.D.
614) was this Cymrian federation finally broken into
three fragments, each destined shortly to disintegrate
into an ever-shifting medley of petty principalities. Yet
in each the ideal of national and racial unity embodied
in the word Cymry<a name="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372"><sup>[372]</sup></a> long survived; and titles borne
to this day by our Royal House, &quot;Duke of Cornwall,&quot;
&quot;Prince of Wales,&quot; &quot;Duke of Albany,&quot; are the far-off
echoes, lingering in each, of the Roman &quot;Comes
Britanniae&quot; and &quot;Dux Britanniarum.&quot; The three
feathers of the Principality may in like manner be
traced to the <i>tufa</i>, or plume, borne before the supreme
authority amongst the Romans of old, as the like are
borne before the Supreme Head of the Roman Church
to this day. And age after age the Cymric harpers
sang of the days when British armies had marched in
triumph to Rome, and the Empire had been won
by British princes, till the exploits of their mystical
&quot;Arthur&quot;<a name="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373"><sup>[373]</sup></a> became the nucleus of a whole cycle of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page248" id="page248">[248]</a></span>
mediaeval romance, and even, for a while, a real force
in practical politics.<a name="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374"><sup>[374]</sup></a></p>

<p>D. 5.&mdash;And as the Britons never quite forgot their
claims on the Empire, so the Empire never quite
forgot its claims on Britain. How entirely the island
was cut off from Rome we can best appreciate by the
references to it in Procopius. This learned author,
writing under Justinian, scarcely 150 years since the
day when the land was fully Roman, conceives of
Britannia and Brittia as two widely distant islands&mdash;the
one off the coast of Spain, the other off the mouth
of the Rhine.<a name="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375"><sup>[375]</sup></a> The latter is shared between the
Angili, Phrissones,<a name="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376"><sup>[376]</sup></a> and Britons, and is divided <i>from
North to South</i><a name="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377"><sup>[377]</sup></a> by a mighty Wall, beyond which
no mortal man can breathe. Hither are ferried over
from Gaul by night the souls of the departed;<a name="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378"><sup>[378]</sup></a> the

work, seeing no one, but perceiving their barks to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page249" id="page249">[249]</a></span>
be heavily sunk in the water, yet accomplishing the
voyage with supernatural celerity.</p>

<p>D. 6.&mdash;About the same date Belisarius offered to
the Goths,<a name="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379"><sup>[379]</sup></a> in exchange for their claim to Sicily,
which his victories had already rendered practically
nugatory, the Roman claims to Britain, &quot;a much
larger island,&quot; which were equally outside the scope
of practical politics for the moment, but might at any
favourable opportunity be once more brought forward.
And, when the Western Empire was revived under
Charlemagne, they were in fact brought forward, and
actually submitted to by half the island. The Celtic
princes of Scotland, the Anglians of Northumbria,
and the Jutes of Kent alike owned the new Caesar as
their Suzerain. And the claim was only abrogated
by the triumph of the counter-claim first made by
Egbert, emphasized by Edward the Elder, and repeated
again and again by our monarchs their descendants,
that the British Crown owes no allegiance to any
potentate on earth, being itself not only Royal, but in
the fullest sense Imperial.<a name="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380"><sup>[380]</sup></a></p>

<p>E. 1.&mdash;Few questions have been more keenly debated
than the extent to which Roman civilization
in Britain survived the English Conquest. On the
one hand we have such high authorities as Professor
Freeman assuring us that our forefathers swept it away
as ruthlessly and as thoroughly as the Saracens in
Africa; on the other, those who consider that little
more disturbance was wrought than by the Danish
invasions. The truth probably lies between the two,
but much nearer to the former than the latter. The
substitution of an English for the Roman name of
almost every Roman site in the country<a name="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381"><sup>[381]</sup></a> could scarcely
have taken place had there been anything like continuity
in their inhabitants. Even the Roman roads, as
we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382"><sup>[382]</sup></a> received English designations. We may
well believe that most Romano-British towns shared
the fate of Anderida (the one recorded instance of
destruction),<a name="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383"><sup>[383]</sup></a> and that the word &quot;chester&quot; was only
applied to the Roman <i>ruins</i> by their destroyers.<a name="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384"><sup>[384]</sup></a>
But such places as London, York, and Lincoln
may well have lived on through the first generation
of mere savage onslaught, after which the English
gradually began to tolerate even for themselves a
town life.</p>

<p>E. 2.&mdash;And though in the country districts the
agricultural population were swept away pitilessly to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page251" id="page251">[251]</a></span>
make room for the invaders,<a name="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385"><sup>[385]</sup></a> till the fens of Ely<a name="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386"><sup>[386]</sup></a>
and the caves of Ribblesdale<a name="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387"><sup>[387]</sup></a> became the only refuge
of the vanquished, yet, undoubtedly, many must have
been retained as slaves, especially amongst the women,
to leaven the language of the conquerors with many a
Latin word, and their ferocity with many a recollection
of the gentler Roman past.</p>

<p>E. 3.&mdash;And there was one link with that past which
not all the massacres and fire-raisings of the Conquest
availed to break. The Romano-British populations
might be slaughtered, the Romano-British towns
destroyed, but the Romano-British Church lived on;
the most precious and most abiding legacy bestowed
by Rome upon our island.</p>

<p>E. 4.&mdash;The origin of that Church has been assigned
by tradition to directly Apostolic sources. The often-quoted
passage from Theodoret,<a name="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388"><sup>[388]</sup></a> of St. Paul having
&quot;brought help&quot; to &quot;the isles of the sea&quot; (&#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#960;&#949;&#955;&#8049;&#947;&#949;&#953; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#962; &#957;&#8053;&#963;&#959;&#953;&#962;) [<b>tais en to
pelagei diakeimenais n&ecirc;sois</b>], can scarcely, however, refer
to this island. No classical author ever uses the
word &#960;&#8051;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#962; [<b>pelagos</b>] of the Oceanic waters; and the epithet
diakeime/nais [<b>diakeimenais</b>], coming, as it does, in connection with the
Apostle's preaching in Italy and Spain, seems rather to
point to the islands between these peninsulas&mdash;Sardinia,
Corsica, and the Balearic Islands. But the well-known
<span class="newpage"><a name="page252" id="page252">[252]</a></span>
words of St. Clement of Rome,<a name="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389"><sup>[389]</sup></a> that St. Paul's
missionary journeys extended to &quot;the End of the
West&quot; &#964;&#8057; &#964;&#8051;&#961;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#948;&#8059;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; [<b>to terma t&ecirc;s duse&ocirc;s</b>], were, as early as the 6th
century, held to imply a visit to Britain (for our island
was popularly supposed by the ancients to lie west of
Spain).<a name="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a> The lines of Venantius (A.D. 580) even seem
to contain a reference to the tradition that he landed
at Portsmouth:</p>

century) ascribes the organization of the British Church
to the visitation, not of St. Paul, but of St. Peter in
person.</p>

again unto Rome.&quot;]<br /></div>

<p>The 'Acta Sanctorum' also mentions this tradition
(filtered through Simeon Metaphrastes), and adds
that St. Peter was in Britain during Boadicea's rebellion,
when he incurred great danger.</p>

<p>E. 6&mdash;The 'Synopsis Apostolorum,' ascribed to
Dorotheus (A.D. 180), but really a 6th-century compilation,
gives us yet another Apostolic preacher, St. Simon
Zelotes. This is probably due to a mere confusion
between &#924;&#945;&#946;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#8055;&#945; [<b>Mabritania</b>] [Mauretania] and &#914;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#957;&#8055;&#945; [<b>Bretannia</b>].
But it is impossible to deny that the Princes of the
Apostles <i>may</i> both have visited Britain, nor indeed is
there anything essentially improbable in their doing so.
We know that Britain was an object of special interest
at Rome during the period of the Conquest, and it
would be quite likely that the idea of simultaneously
conquering this new Roman dominion for Christ should
suggest itself to the two Apostles so specially connected
with the Roman Church.<a name="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a></p>

<p>E. 7.&mdash;But while we may <i>possibly</i> accept this legend,
it is otherwise with the famous and beautiful story
which ascribes the foundation of our earliest church
<span class="newpage"><a name="page254" id="page254">[254]</a></span>
at Glastonbury to the pilgrimage of St. Joseph of
Arimathaea, whose staff, while he rested on Weary-all
Hill, took root, and became the famous winter thorn,
which</p>

<div class="blkquot">&quot;Blossoms at Christmas, mindful of our Lord,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a></div>

<p>and who, accordingly, set up, hard by, a little church
of wattle to be the centre of local Christianity.</p>

<p>E. 8.&mdash;Such was the tale which accounted for the
fact that this humble edifice developed into the
stateliest sanctuary of all Britain. We first find it, in
its final shape, in Geoffrey of Monmouth (1150); but
already in the 10th century the special sanctity of the
shrine was ascribed to a supernatural origin,<a name="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a> as a
contemporary Life of St. Dunstan assures us; and it
is declared, in an undisputed Charter of Edgar, to be
&quot;the first church in the Kingdom built by the disciples
of Christ.&quot; But no earlier reference is known;
for the passages cited from Gildas and Melkinus are
quite untrustworthy. So striking a phenomenon as
the winter thorn would be certain to become an
object of heathen devotion;<a name="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> and, as usual, the early
preachers would Christianize the local cult, as they
Christianized the Druidical figment of a Holy Cup
(perhaps also local in its origin), into the sublime
<span class="newpage"><a name="page255" id="page255">[255]</a></span>
mysticism of the Sangreal legend, connected likewise
with Joseph of Arimathaea.<a name="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397"><sup>[397]</sup></a></p>

<p>E. 9.&mdash;That the original church of Glaston was
really of wattle is more than probable, for the remains
of British buildings thus constructed have been found
abundantly in the neighbouring peat. The Arimathaean
theory of its consecration became so generally accepted
that at the Council of Constance (1419) precedence
was actually accorded to our Bishops as representing
the senior Church of Christendom. But the oldest
variant of the legend says nothing about Arimathaea,
but speaks only of an undetermined &quot;Joseph&quot; as the
leader [<i>decurio</i>]<a name="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398"><sup>[398]</sup></a> of twelve missionary comrades who
with him settled down at Glastonbury. And this
may well be true. Such bands (as we see in the Life
of Columba) were the regular system in Celtic mission
work, and survived in that of the Preaching Friars:</p>

<div class="blkquot">&quot;For thirteen is a Covent, as I guess.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399"><sup>[399]</sup></a></div>
<br />

<p>E. 10.&mdash;And though such high authorities as Mr.
Haddan have come to the conclusion that Christianity
in Britain was confined to a small minority even
amongst the Roman inhabitants of the island, and
almost vanished with them, yet the catena of references
to British converts can scarcely be thus set aside.
They begin in Apostolic times and in special connection
with St. Paul. Martial tells us of a British princess
<span class="newpage"><a name="page256" id="page256">[256]</a></span>
named Claudia Rufina<a name="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400"><sup>[400]</sup></a> (very probably the
daughter of that Claudius Cogidubnus whom we meet
in Tacitus as at once a British King and an Imperial
Legate),<a name="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> whose beauty and wit made no little sensation
in Rome; whither she had doubtless been sent at
once for education and as a hostage for her father's
fidelity. And one of the most beautiful of his Epigrams
speaks of the marriage of this foreigner to a Roman
of high family named Pudens, belonging to the Gens
Aemilia (of which the Pauline family formed a part):</p>

<div class="blkquot">
&quot;Claudia, Rufe, meo nubet peregrina Pudenti,<br />
Macte esto taedis, O Hymenaee, suis.<br />
Diligat illa senem quondam; sed et ipsa marito,<br />
Tunc quoque cum fuerit, non videatur anus.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a><br />
<br />
[To RUFUS.<br />
Claudia, from far-off climes, my Pudens weds:<br />
With choicest bliss, O Hymen, crown their heads!<br />
May she still love her spouse when gray and old,<br />
He in her age unfaded charms behold.]<br />
</div>

<p>It may have been in consequence of this marriage
that Pudens joined with Claudius Cogidubnus in
setting up the Imperial Temple at Chichester.<a name="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a> And
the fact that Claudia was an adopted member of the
Rufine family shows that she was connected with the
Gens Pomponia to which this family belonged.</p>

<p>E. 11.&mdash;Now Aulus Plautius, the conqueror of
Britain, had married a Pomponia, who in A.D. 57 was
accused of practising an illicit religion, and, though
pronounced guiltless by her husband (to whose
<span class="newpage"><a name="page257" id="page257">[257]</a></span>
domestic tribunal she was left, as Roman Law permitted),
passed the rest of her life in retirement.<a name="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a>
When we read of an illicit religion in connection with
Britain, our first thought is, naturally, that Druidism is
intended.<a name="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a> But there are strong reasons for supposing
that Pomponia was actually a Christian. The names
of her family are found in one of the earliest Christian
catacombs in Rome, that of Calixtus; and that Christianity
had its converts in very high quarters we know
from the case of Clemens and Domitilla, closely related
to the Imperial throne.</p>

<p>E. 12.&mdash;Turning next to St. Paul's Second Epistle
to Timothy, we find, in close connection, the names
of Pudens and Claudia (along with that of the future
Pope Linus) amongst the salutations from Roman
Christians. And recent excavations have established
the fact that the house of Pudens was used for Christian
worship at this date, and is now represented by
the church known as St. Pudentiana.<a name="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a> That this
should have been so proves that this Pudens was no
slave going under his master's name (as was sometimes
done), but a man of good position in Rome. Short
of actual proof it would be hard to imagine a series of
evidences more morally convincing that the Pudens
and Claudia of Martial are the Pudens and Claudia
of St. Paul, and that they, as well as Pomponia, were
<span class="newpage"><a name="page258" id="page258">[258]</a></span>
Christians. Whether, then, St. Paul did or did not actually
visit Britain, the earliest British Christianity is, at least,
closely connected with his name.</p>

<p>E. 13.&mdash;Neither legendary nor historical sources tell
us of any further development of British Christianity
till the latter days of the 2nd century. Then, however,
it had become sufficiently widespread to furnish
a common-place for ecclesiastical declamation on the
all-conquering influence of the Gospel. Both Tertullian
and Origen<a name="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> thus use it. The former numbers in
his catalogue of believing countries even the districts
of Britain beyond the Roman pale, <i>Britannorum
inaccessa Romanis loca, Christo vero subdita</i><a name="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a>. And
in this lies the interest of his reference, as pointing to
the native rather than the Roman element being the
predominant factor in the British Church. For just
at this period comes in the legend preserved by Bede,<a name="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a>
that a mission was sent to Britain by Pope Eleutherius<a name="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a>
in response to an appeal from &quot;Lucius Britanniae
Rex.&quot; The story, which Bede probably got from the
'Catalogus Pontificum,'<a name="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410"><sup>[410]</sup></a> may be apocryphal; but it
would never have been invented had British Christianity
been found merely or mainly in the Roman
veneer of the population. Modern criticism finds in
it this kernel of truth, that the persecution which gave
the Gallican Church the martyrs of Lyons, also sent
her scattered refugees as missionaries into the less
<span class="newpage"><a name="page259" id="page259">[259]</a></span>
dangerous regions of Britain;&mdash;those remoter parts, in
especial, where even the long arm of the Imperial
Government could not reach them.</p>

<p>E. 14.&mdash;The Picts, however, as a nation, remained
savage heathens even to the 7th century, and the
bulk of our Christian population must have been
within the Roman pale; but little vexed, it would
seem, by persecution, till it came into conflict with
the thorough-going Imperialism of Diocletian.<a name="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411"><sup>[411]</sup></a> Its
martyrs were then numbered, according to Gildas, by
thousands, according to Bede by hundreds; and their
chief, St. Alban, at least, is a fairly established historical
entity.<a name="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a> Nor is there any reason to doubt that
after Constantine South Britain was as fully Christian
as any country in Europe. In the earliest days of his
reign (A.D. 314) we find three bishops,<a name="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413"><sup>[413]</sup></a> together with a
priest and a deacon, representing<a name="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414"><sup>[414]</sup></a> the British Church
at the Council of Arles (which, amongst other things,
condemned the marriage of the &quot;innocent divorcee&quot;<a name="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415"><sup>[415]</sup></a>).
<span class="newpage"><a name="page260" id="page260">[260]</a></span>
And the same number figure in the Council of Ariminum
(360), as the only prelates (out of the 400)
who deigned to accept from the Emperor the expenses
of their journey and attendance.</p>

<p>E. 15.&mdash;This Council was called by Constantius II.
in the semi-Arian interest, and not allowed to break
up till after repudiating the Nicene formula. But the
lapse was only for a moment. Before the decade was
out Athanasius could write of Britain as notoriously
orthodox,<a name="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416"><sup>[416]</sup></a> and before the century closes we have
frequent references to our island as a fully Christian
and Catholic land. Chrysostom speaks of its churches
and its altars and &quot;the power of the Word&quot; in its
pulpits,<a name="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417"><sup>[417]</sup></a> of its diligent study of Scripture and Catholic
doctrine,<a name="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a> of its acceptance of Catholic discipline,<a name="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a>

India, to Africa, or to Britain, thou wilt find <i>In the
beginning was the Word</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420"><sup>[420]</sup></a> Jerome, in turn, tells of

seldom<br /> found&mdash;Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>F. 1.&mdash;The fruits of all this vigorous Christian life
soon showed themselves in the Church of Britain by
the evolution of noteworthy individual Christians.
First in order comes Ninias, the Apostle of the
Southern Picts, commissioned to the work, after years
of training at Rome, by Pope Siricius (A.D. 394), and
fired by the example of St. Martin, the great prelate
of Gaul. To this saint (or, to speak more exactly,
under his invocation) Ninias, on hearing of his death
in A.D. 400, dedicated his newly-built church at Whithern<a name="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a>
in Galloway, the earliest recorded example of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page262" id="page262">[262]</a></span>
this kind of dedication in Britain.<a name="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a> Galloway may
have been the native home of Ninias, and was certainly
the head-quarters of his ministry.</p>

<p>F. 2.&mdash;The work of Ninias amongst the Picts was
followed in the next generation by the more abiding
work of St. Patrick amongst the Scots of Ireland.
Nay, even the Continent was indebted to British
piety; though few British visitors to the Swiss Oberland
remember that the Christianity they see around
them is due to the zeal of a British Mission. Yet
there seems no solid reason for doubting that so it is.
Somewhere about the time of St. Patrick, two British
priests, Beatus and Justus, entered the district by the
Brunig Pass, and set up their first church at Einigen,
near Thun. There Justus abode as the settled Missioner
of the neighbourhood, while Beatus made his
home in the ivy-clad cave above the lake which still
bears his name,<a name="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> sailing up and down with the Gospel
message, and evangelizing the valleys and uplands
now so familiar to his fellow-countrymen&mdash;Grindelwald,
Lauterbrunnen, M&uuml;rren, Kandersteg.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page263" id="page263">[263]</a></span>
<p>F. 3.&mdash;And while the light of the Gospel was thus
spreading on every side from our land, Britain was
also becoming all too famous as the nurse of error.
The British Pelagius,<a name="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a> who erred concerning the doctrine
of free-will, grew to be a heresiarch of the first
order;<a name="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a> and his follower Fastidius, or Faustus, the
saintly Abbot of Lerins in the Hy&egrave;res, the friend of
Sidonius Apollinaris,<a name="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429"><sup>[429]</sup></a> was, in his day, only less
renowned. He asserted the materiality of the soul.
Both were able writers; and Pelagius was the first
to adopt the plan of promulgating his heresies not as
his own, but as the tenets of supposititious individuals
of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>F. 4.&mdash;Pelagianism spread so widely in Britain that
the Catholics implored for aid from over-sea. St.
Germanus of Auxerre, and St. Lupus, Bishop of Troyes
(whose sanctity had disarmed the ferocity even of
Attila), came<a name="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a> accordingly (in 429) and vindicated
the faith in a synod held at Verulam so successfully
that the neighbouring shrine of St. Alban was the
scene of a special service of thanksgiving. In a second
Mission, fifteen years later, Germanus set the seal to
his work, stamping out throughout all the land both
this new heresy and such remains of heathenism as
<span class="newpage"><a name="page264" id="page264">[264]</a></span>
were still to be found in Southern Britain. While thus
engaged on the Border he found his work endangered
by a raiding host of Picts or Saxons, or both. The
Saint, who had been a military chieftain in his youth,
promptly took the field at the head of his flock, many
of whom were but newly baptized. It was Easter Eve,
and he took advantage of the sacred ceremonies of
that holy season, which were then actually performed
by night. From the New Fire, the &quot;Lumen Christi,&quot;
was kindled a line of beacons along the Christian lines,
and when Germanus intoned the threefold Easter
Alleluia, the familiar strain was echoed from lip to lip
throughout the host. Stricken with panic at the
sudden outburst of light and song, the enemy, without
a blow, broke and fled.<a name="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a></p>

<p>F. 5.&mdash;This story, as told by Constantius, and confirmed
by both Nennius and Bede, incidentally furnishes
us with something of a key to the main difficulty
in accepting the widely-spread Romano-British Christianity
to which the foregoing citations testify. What,
it is asked, has become of all the Romano-British
churches? Why are no traces of them found amongst
the abundant Roman remains all over the land? That
they were the special objects of destruction at the
Saxon invasion we learn from Gildas. But this does
not account for their very foundations having disappeared;
yet at Silchester<a name="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a> alone have modern excavations
<span class="newpage"><a name="page265" id="page265">[265]</a></span>
unearthed any even approximately certain
example of them. Where are all the rest?</p>

<p>F. 6.&mdash;The question is partly answered when we
read that the soldiers of Germanus had erected in
their camp a church of wattle, and that such was the
usual material of which, even as late as 446, British
churches were built (as at Glastonbury). Seldom
indeed would such leave any trace behind them; and
thus the country churches of Roman Britain would be
sought in vain by excavators. In the towns, however,
stone or brick would assuredly be used, and to account
for the paucity of ecclesiastical ruins three answers
may be suggested.</p>

<p>F. 7.&mdash;First, the number of continuously unoccupied
Romano-British cities is very small indeed. Except
at Silchester, Anderida, and Uriconium, almost every
one has become an English town. But when this
took place early in the English settlement of the land,
the ruins of the Romano-British churches would still
be clearly traceable at the conversion of the English,
and would be rebuilt (as St. Martin's at Canterbury
was in all probability rebuilt)<a name="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433"><sup>[433]</sup></a> for the use of English
Christianity, the old material<a name="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434"><sup>[434]</sup></a> being worked up into
the new edifices. It is probable that many of our
churches thus stand on the very spot where the
Romano-British churches stood of old. But this
<span class="newpage"><a name="page266" id="page266">[266]</a></span>
very fact would obliterate the remains of these
churches.</p>

<p>F. 8.&mdash;Secondly, it is very possible that many of the
heathen temples may, after the edict of Theodosius
(A.D. 392), have been turned into churches (like the
Pantheon at Rome), so that <i>their</i> remains may mark
ecclesiastical sites. There are reasons for believing
that in various places, such as St. Paul's, London,
St. Peter's, Cambridge, and St. Mary's, Ribchester,
Christian worship did actually thus succeed Pagan on
the same site.</p>

<p>F. 9.&mdash;Thirdly, as Lanciani points out, the earliest
Christian churches were simply the ordinary dwelling-houses
of such wealthier converts as were willing to
permit meetings for worship beneath their roof, which
in time became formally consecrated to that purpose.
Such a dwelling-house usually consisted of an oblong
central hall, with a pillared colonnade, opening into a
roofed cloister or peristyle on either side, at one end
into a smaller guest-room [<i>tablinum</i>], at the other
into the porch of entry. The whole was arranged
thus:</p>

</div>

<p>It will be readily seen that we have here a building on
<span class="newpage"><a name="page267" id="page267">[267]</a></span>
the lines of an ordinary church. The small original
congregation would meet, like other guests, in the
reception-room. As numbers increased, the hall and
adjoining cloisters would have to be used (the former
being roofed in); the reception-room being reserved
for the most honoured members, and ultimately
becoming the chancel of a fully-developed church,
with nave and aisles complete.<a name="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435"><sup>[435]</sup></a> It <i>may</i> be, therefore,
that some of the Roman villas found in Britain were
really churches.<a name="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436"><sup>[436]</sup></a></p>

<p>F. 10.&mdash;This, however, is a less probable explanation
of the absence of ecclesiastical remains; and the large
majority of Romano-British church sites are, as I
believe, still in actual use amongst us for their original
purpose. And it may be considered as fairly proved,
that before Britain was cut off from the Empire the
Romano-British Church had a rite<a name="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437"><sup>[437]</sup></a> and a vigorous
corporate life of its own, which the wave of heathen
invasion could not wholly submerge. It lived on,
shattered, perhaps, and disorganized, but not utterly
crushed, to be strengthened in due time by a closer
union with its parent stem, through the Mission of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page268" id="page268">[268]</a></span>
Augustine, to feel the reflex glow of its own missionary
efforts in the fervour of Columba and his followers,<a name="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438"><sup>[438]</sup></a>
and, finally, to form an integral part of that Ecclesia
Anglicana whose influence knit our country into one,
and inspired the Great Charter of our constitutional
liberties.<a name="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439"><sup>[439]</sup></a> Her faith and her freedom are the abiding
debt which Britain owes to her connection with
Rome.</p>

Neolithic erection. No metal was found, but quantities of flint
implements, broken in the arduous task of dressing the great
Sarsen monoliths. The process seems to have been that still
used for granite, viz. to cut parallel channels on the rough surface,
and then break and rub down the ridges between. This was
done by the use of conical lumps of Sarsen stone, weighing from
20 to 60 lbs., several of which were discovered bearing traces of
usage, both in pounding and rubbing. The monoliths examined
were found to be thus tooled accurately down to the very bottom,
8 or 9 feet below ground. At Avebury the stones are not dressed.</p></div>

earlier shoes seem to have been rather such slippers as are now
used by horses drawing mowing-machines on college lawns.
They were sometimes of rope: <i>Solea sparta pes bovis induitur</i>
(Columella), sometimes of iron: <i>Et supinam animam gravido
derelinquere caeno Ferream ut solam tenaci in voragine mula</i>
(Catullus, xvii. 25). Even gold was used: <i>Poppaea jumentis suis
soleas ex auro induebat</i> (Suet., 'Nero,' xxx.). The Romano-British
horseshoes are thin broad bands of iron, fastened on by
three nails, and without heels. See also Beckmann's 'History

unoccupied. In the days of Alfred it is still a &quot;waste Chester&quot; in
the A.S. Chronicle. The word <i>Chester</i> is only associated with
Roman fortifications in Southern Britain. But north of the wall,

which cannot possibly have ever been Roman. (See 'Antiquary'

<a name="Footnote_296_296"></a><a href="#FNanchor_296_296">[296]</a><div class="note"><p> Mithraism is first heard of in the 2nd century A.D.,
as an eccentric cult having many of the features of Christianity,
especially the sense of Sin and the doctrine that the vicarious
blood-shedding essential to remission must be connected with a
New Baptismal Birth unto Righteousness. The Mithraists
carried out this idea by the highly realistic ceremonies of the
<i>Taurobolium</i>; the penitent neophyte standing beneath a grating
on which the victim was slain, and thus being literally bathed
in the atoning blood, afterwards being considered as born again
[<i>renatus</i>]. It thus evolved a real and heartfelt devotion to the
Supreme Being, whom, however (unlike Christianity), it was
willing to worship under the names of the old Pagan Deities;
frequently combining their various attributes in joint Personalities
of unlimited complexity. One figure has the head of Jupiter,
the rays of Phoebus, and the trident of Neptune; another is
furnished with the wings of Cupid, the wand of Mercury, the
club of Hercules, and the spear of Mars; and so forth.
Mithraism thus escaped the persecution which the essential
exclusiveness of their Faith drew down upon Christians;
gradually transforming by its deeper spirituality the more frigid
cults of earlier Paganism, and making them its own. The little
band of truly noble men and women who in the latter half of
the 4th century made the last stand against the triumph of

like St. Alban's, the martyr who suffered on the spot. Besides
Whithern, the church of Canterbury was dedicated about this

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
