<h2>DOROTHY DAINTY'S<br>
GAY TIMES</h2>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapI">CHAPTER I</a></h3>

<h4>THE FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL</h4>

<p class="chapone">The great gateway stood wide open, and through
it one could see the fine stone house with its vine-covered
balconies, its rare flowers and stately trees.</p>

<p>A light breeze swayed the roses, sending out their perfume in
little gusts of sweetness, while across the path the merry sunbeams
flickered, like little dancing elves.</p>

<p><a name="I001">Down the path came a lovely little girl</a>,
swinging a skipping-rope, and dancing over and under it in perfect
time with the song which she was singing.</p>

<p>The sunlight touched her bright curls, making her look like a
fairy, and now she skipped backward, and forward, around the
circular garden, and back again, only pausing to rest when another
little girl ran across the lawn to meet her.</p>

<p>She was Dorothy Dainty, the lovely little daughter of the house,
and the sprightly, dark-eyed child who now joined her was Nancy
Ferris, her dearest playmate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just wishing you'd come out, for I've something to
tell you,&rdquo; Dorothy said. &ldquo;You know Aunt Charlotte has
all her plans ready for opening her private school next week, and
you heard her tell mamma that the class was <i>very</i>
full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know it's to be a big class,&rdquo; said Nancy,
&ldquo;for besides all the girls that used to be in it, there's to
be one new one, and one <i>boy</i>, Katie Dean's cousin, Reginald,
and,&mdash;oh, <i>did</i> you know that Arabella is to join the
class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nancy, are you <i>sure?</i>&rdquo; asked Dorothy;
&ldquo;only yesterday we looked over toward her house, and there
seemed to be no one at home.&rdquo; Nancy's eyes were merry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and look <i>now!</i>&rdquo; she said, clasping
Dorothy's hand, and running with her down to the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;see all those windows
open, and somebody out there behind the house beating a rug; you
see they <i>are</i> at home, and that's her queer little old Aunt
Matilda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dorothy looked at the resolute little figure, and wondered how
the thin arm could wield the rug-beater with so much energy. She
remembered that Arabella had said that her father <i>always</i> did
as Aunt Matilda directed, and truly the small woman appeared able
to marshal an army of men, if she chose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Arabella will go over to the public
school,&rdquo; said Dorothy; &ldquo;she doesn't have to enter Aunt
Charlotte's private class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but she <i>will</i>, I just know she will,&rdquo;
Nancy replied, &ldquo;and Aunt Charlotte'll <i>have</i> to let her.
You know Mr. Corryville was in your papa's class at college, and if
he says he wishes Arabella to join the class, your papa will surely
say &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He certainly will,&rdquo; said Dorothy, &ldquo;but
there's one thing to think of,&rdquo; she said, with a bright
smile, &ldquo;There are nice girls in the class, and if Arabella is
queer, we <i>mustn't</i> mind it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'll <i>try</i> not to,&rdquo; Nancy said, and then, as
Dorothy again swung her rope, Nancy &ldquo;ran in,&rdquo; and the
two skipped around the house together, the rope whipping the gravel
walk in time with the dancing feet.</p>

<p>It was cool and shady near the wall, and they sat down upon a
low seat where the soft breeze fanned their flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd almost forgotten something that I meant to tell
you,&rdquo; Dorothy said. &ldquo;You know Aunt Charlotte says that
the pupils are to give a little entertainment each month, when we
are to have dialogues, songs, solo dances, pieces to be spoken, and
chorus music. Well, mamma has arranged to have a fine little stage
and curtain. You didn't know that, <i>did</i> you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I didn't,&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;and I guess
the others will be surprised. You haven't told them yet, have
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only knew it this morning myself, but I'm eager to tell
them,&rdquo; said Dorothy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here's Mollie Merton and Flossie Barnet now,&rdquo; cried
Nancy, and, turning, Dorothy saw the two playmates running up the
driveway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mollie was over at my house,&rdquo; said Flossie,
&ldquo;and we saw you and Nancy just as you ran around the house,
and we thought we'd come over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were wild to know if our private school is
<i>truly</i> to commence next week. Mamma said it would if enough
pupils were ready to join it,&rdquo; said Mollie, &ldquo;and we
knew Katie Dean's cousin was a new one, and won't it be funny to
have one boy in the class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but he is just a <i>little</i> boy,&rdquo; said
Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he must begin to go to school this year, and he says
he likes girls ever so much better than boys, so he asked if he
might go to our school,&rdquo; Dorothy said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <i>always</i> says he likes girls best,&rdquo; said
Flossie; &ldquo;isn't he a queer little fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; Mollie said, so drolly that they all
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there is a new pupil, who has just come here to live,
and she is <i>very</i> nice, Jeanette Earl says,&rdquo; and as she
spoke Dorothy looked up at her friends, a soft pleading in her blue
eyes.</p>

<p>She intended to give a kindly welcome to the new pupil, and she
hoped that the others would be friendly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does Jeanette know?&rdquo; asked Mollie, bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jeanette ought to know,&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;for
the new little girl is her cousin, I mean her <i>third</i>
cousin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Nina is Jeanette's sister,&rdquo; said Mollie,
&ldquo;so what does <i>she</i> say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She didn't say anything,&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;she
just <i>looked</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arabella Corryville is to be in our class,&rdquo; said
Flossie, &ldquo;and when I told Uncle Harry he laughed, and asked
me if her Aunt Matilda was coming to school with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course they laughed, and it was Mollie who first spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Uncle Harry is always joking,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and sometimes I can't tell whether he is in earnest, or only
saying things just for fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you'll laugh when I tell you what he said
next! He said that although he had graduated from college, and now
was in business, he would urge Aunt Charlotte to let him attend a
<i>few</i> sessions of our school, if Arabella's Aunt Matilda was
to be there. He said it would be a great pleasure which he really
could not miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How they laughed at the idea of Flossie's handsome young uncle
in the little private school, while Arabella's prim little aunt was
also a pupil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked him what he meant,&rdquo; said Flossie, who
looked completely puzzled, &ldquo;and he said that sometimes a
man's wits needed sharpening, and that Aunt Matilda would be a
regular file. Papa laughed, but mamma said: &lsquo;Harry, Harry,
you really mustn't,&rsquo; and he ran up to the music-room
whistling &lsquo;O dear, what can the matter be?&rsquo; I can't
help laughing even when I don't understand his teasing jokes, he
says things in such a funny way, while his eyes just
dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked very handsome the day he wore his uniform, with
the gold lace on it,&rdquo; said Dorothy; &ldquo;don't you
remember, Flossie? Your aunt was on the piazza, and she stooped and
pinned a rose in his buttonhole. Do you think he knew how fine he
looked, when he sprang into the saddle, and rode away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; Flossie said, her blue eyes very
thoughtful, &ldquo;he never seems to think about it, and one thing
I don't at all understand, he's big, and brave, and manly, yet he
plays with me so gently, and he's as full of fun as a
boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's why we all like him,&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;and
he never acts as if we were just little girls, and so not worth
noticing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the day that the tramp came into our
kitchen, and frightened the cook? Uncle Harry was just strolling
along the driveway. He walked into the kitchen, took the dirty
tramp by the collar and marched him right out to the street,&rdquo;
and Flossie's cheeks glowed with pride for her dear Uncle
Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a moment after, he saw little Reginald fall off
his bicycle, and you ought to have seen how tenderly he picked him
up, and brushed off the dust, and he was quite as gentle as mamma
would have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he's just fine,&rdquo; said Mollie, &ldquo;and I
<i>do</i> wish he would visit our school on a day when Arabella's
aunt would be there! I love to see him when he looks at her.
Someway he seems so very respectful, and yet his eyes
laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it's just a few days now before school begins, and
what fun we'll have,&rdquo; said Flossie, &ldquo;and perhaps
Arabella will invite her aunt to one of our entertainments; if she
does, I'm just sure Uncle Harry would go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come here this minute, every one of you,&rdquo;
called a cheery voice, and Nina Earl stepped through an opening in
the hedge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how surprised you look! I've been over to the stone
cottage to call for you, Nancy, and Aunt Charlotte said that you
were with Dorothy, so I ran across the lawn. I could hear you all
talking, and I was wild to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell it, tell it, Nina!&rdquo; cried Mollie.</p>

<p>Nina looked back through the opening in the hedge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's just saying &lsquo;good-morning&rsquo; to Aunt
Charlotte,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and let me tell you something;
she's been all over the stone cottage, looking into this thing and
peeping into that, till I'd think Aunt Charlotte would be wild.
It's Arabella's aunt, and she says she came to learn if the house
was a healthy one to be in, and to see if the plumbing was all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dorothy's sweet eyes suddenly flashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn't she think my papa would keep Aunt Charlotte's
house as comfortable as ours?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, 'tisn't that!&rdquo; laughed Nina, &ldquo;she said
she felt obliged to find out if the cottage was a healthy place for
a private school to be in, before she could say that Arabella might
belong to the class! Did you ever hear anything like
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what makes her let Arabella come to our
school?&rdquo; queried blunt little Mollie; &ldquo;she could go to
the public school. I guess we wouldn't mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma says we must be kind to Arabella,&rdquo; said
Dorothy, &ldquo;so I think we mustn't speak like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be kind to her when she comes,&rdquo; said Mollie,
&ldquo;because your mamma wishes it, but <i>now</i>, before school
begins, I'm going to say that I just <i>wish</i> Arabella was going
to the other school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others felt, as Mollie did, that the class would be quite as
pleasant if Arabella attended the public school, but they did not
like to say so.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak">
<p>The few days of waiting were past, and now the first day of
school had come. The door of the pretty stone cottage stood wide
open, as if assuring a welcome to the little pupils who would soon
arrive, while the sunlight streamed in across the hall, giving a
cheery greeting.</p>

<p>On the rug sat Pompey, the cat, his fine coat sleek and glossy,
and his white bosom as pure as much washing could make it. His paws
were snugly tucked in, and he purred softly to himself as if he
knew that it was nearly time for the pupils to arrive, and
remembered that the little girls had been very fond of him.</p>

<p>In the cheery sitting-room, which was used as a schoolroom, sat
Aunt Charlotte Grayson, looking over some books which lay upon the
table.</p>

<p>Her soft gray gown and broad lace collar were most becoming, and
she looked every inch the gentlewoman that she really was. She had
once been Mrs. Dainty's governess, and now, as mistress of a
thriving private school, she was independent and happy. The class
was not a large one, but the little pupils belonged to families who
were well able to pay generously for fine instruction, and her home
at the stone cottage was a loving gift from Mr. and Mrs.
Dainty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grayson had permitted Dorothy and Nancy to call her
&ldquo;Aunt Charlotte,&rdquo; and now it had become the loving
title by which all her pupils addressed her.</p>

<p>She was eager to have her little class assemble, and, wondering
if they were late, she looked at her watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quarter of nine,&rdquo; she said, and as if he understood
what she had said, Pompey blinked up at the tall clock, yawned, and
looked at the door.</p>

<p>The sound of merry voices made him prick up his ears. A moment
more, and Dorothy and Nancy, Mollie and Flossie, Nina and Jeanette
Earl ran up the steps and in at the open door. Pompey received his
usual number of love-pats, and then the girls, having hung their
hats and coats in the hall, walked quietly in to greet Aunt
Charlotte.</p>

<p>It was a fixed rule at the private school that there should
never be any haste in reaching places in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It matters not that you are little girls, or that you are
at school,&rdquo; Mrs. Grayson would say; &ldquo;let me always have
the pleasure of seeing you enter the class-room in as gentle a
manner as you would enter a drawing-room,&rdquo; and her pupils
took pleasure in doing as she wished.</p>

<p>The broad window-seats were banked with flowering plants, and as
the children took their places they thought it the brightest,
cheeriest schoolroom in the world.</p>

<p>As if to show that he also had a place in Aunt Charlotte's
class, Pompey ran across the floor and sprang up into a space on
one window-seat between two large flowerpots, where he could enjoy
a sun-bath.</p>

<p>Katie Dean, with her little Cousin Reginald, now entered, just
in time to avoid being late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you said your cousin was coming,&rdquo;
whispered Mollie, but Aunt Charlotte had opened her Testament, and
was commencing to read, so Nina only shook her head, and Mollie saw
that she must wait until recess to know what Nina would say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be
called the children of God,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Aunt Charlotte, and
every girl looked towards Flossie Barnet, who was always trying to
say a pleasant word of an absent friend, or to coax two playmates,
who had become estranged, to be fast friends again. Often they had
heard her Uncle Harry say: &ldquo;Flossie, you're a
peacemaker.&rdquo; Her hands were clasped, and her blue eyes were
full of interest in the verse which Aunt Charlotte was reading. Her
red lips moved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They shall be called the children of
God,&rsquo;&rdquo; she whispered, and in her gentle little heart
she determined to be, if possible, more kind and loving than ever
before, toward her playmates.</p>

<p>Little Reginald had failed to understand the verse, and sat
staring at Aunt Charlotte with round eyes. He was a handsome little
fellow, with soft flaxen curls, and a smart, sturdy figure, and as
he looked up into Aunt Charlotte's face, he seemed like a pudgy
cupid whom some one had dressed in a sailor suit.</p>

<p>Singing followed the reading, and all through the two merry
songs which they sang, Reginald watched Aunt Charlotte, and
wondered over the verse which she had read. When the arithmetic
lesson was over, Aunt Charlotte asked if any one had a question to
ask.</p>

<p>Katie Dean wished to hear an example explained, and when it had
been made clear to her, Reginald held up his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's &lsquo;peacemakers&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte explained the verse, and Reginald listened, but
it was easy to see that he was disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you understand now what the peacemakers are?&rdquo;
Aunt Charlotte asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes'm,&rdquo; said Reginald, &ldquo;but I wish I
didn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; questioned Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Cause I thought grandma was a peacemaker,&rdquo;
Reginald said, &ldquo;for she's <i>piecin'</i> a silk patchwork
quilt, an' papa said she'd be <i>blessed</i> glad when it's
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte was the only one who did not laugh, but the small
boy was not at all vexed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> needn't laugh,&rdquo; he said to Katie,
&ldquo;for you've seen her makin' pieces out of silk, an' what's
the difference between <i>makin' pieces</i> an'
<i>peacemakin'?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapII">CHAPTER II</a></h3>

<h4>ARABELLA AT SCHOOL</h4>

<p class="chapone">When recess time came Mollie had forgotten to
ask Nina if her cousin was to be a pupil, and it happened that
neither of the others questioned her.</p>

<p>They were in the midst of a game of hide-and-seek, when Mollie,
who, with Nina, was hiding behind a large rosebush, looked up just
in time to see the garden gate open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that's Arabella!&rdquo; said Nina, &ldquo;but why
has she brought her Aunt Matilda with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess she didn't,&rdquo; whispered Mollie, &ldquo;it's
likely her Aunt Matilda's bringing <i>her</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nina stifled a laugh, and they saw the two go along the walk,
and enter the cottage.</p>

<p>Flossie, who had been &ldquo;it,&rdquo; ran quite around the
house, and the others &ldquo;ran in,&rdquo; Reginald loudly
shouting, &ldquo;All in, all in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flossie returned, laughing gaily to think that they had all got
in free. Then they commenced to talk of the new pupil, and quite
forgot their game.</p>

<p>The schoolroom windows were open, and Aunt Matilda's shrill,
piping voice could be plainly heard, but the children were not near
enough to know what she was saying.</p>

<p>They saw her turn to go, and then, when she reached the door,
she drew something from her bag, and placed it in Arabella's
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you s'pose she's giving her?&rdquo;
whispered Nina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Peppermints!</i>&rdquo; said Mollie, but although she
had whispered it, she felt that Dorothy had heard it, and knew that
both she and Nina had been laughing at Arabella and her aunt.
Mollie's cheeks flushed, and she looked down at her shoes. She knew
that Dorothy's sweet eyes were looking at her, not angrily, but
with a tender grieving.</p>

<p>Dorothy was full of fun, and ready for merriment at any time,
but she saw nothing amusing in laughing at a playmate, or friend,
and she had asked them all to be kind to Arabella.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte turned to the window, and set the little silver
bell tinkling, and the pupils at once filed into the
schoolroom.</p>

<p>They found Arabella Corryville sitting primly in her place. Her
small, thin hands were clasped upon her desk, and she looked at the
pupils as they filed in, peeping first over her glasses, and then
through them, as if she were hunting for little faults which she
really hoped to find.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte had told her that on this, her first day of
school, she might listen to the recitations, and on the next day
come with her lessons prepared, and then recite with the class.</p>

<p>She sat very still, only moving her round eyes to watch the
pupils, and as she did not smile, one could not guess if she were
pleased with the school or not.</p>

<p>The little girls busied themselves with their books, but
Reginald kept his blue eyes fixed upon Arabella, as if he could
think of nothing else.</p>

<p>At first she seemed not to notice him, but after a time she
moved restlessly on her seat, and wriggled about in a way that
delighted the small boy.</p>

<p>Arabella was not used to being stared at. She always stared
boldly at other people, but here was some one who looked at her
without so much as blinking. She glanced at the clock, and then, as
if just remembering something, took a small bottle from her pocket,
shook some pills into her hand, swallowed them, and turned to see
if Reginald were looking. He was, and Arabella was provoked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you staring at?&rdquo; she whispered rudely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he whispered, not a bit abashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you just <i>needn't</i>,&rdquo; said Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know <i>I needn't</i>,&rdquo; replied the small boy,
&ldquo;but I like to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Cause you're funny,&rdquo; Reginald said.</p>

<p>It was not strange that Arabella was angry. Would any girl be
pleased to have a small boy watching her, and declaring that she
was &ldquo;funny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now Aunt Charlotte was calling the youngest class in
reading, and Reginald hastily snatched his book, and began to hunt
for the lesson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The third page, Reginald,&rdquo; said Aunt Charlotte;
&ldquo;you may read the first paragraph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He found the place, and read the lines without a mistake. It was
his first term at school, but his mother had found pleasure in
teaching him, and he read quite as well as some of the younger
pupils.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read the next paragraph, Reginald,&rdquo; said Aunt
Charlotte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When the king rode over the highway, the sun
glistened upon his,&mdash;on his,&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a word which Reginald had never seen, and he frowned
until an odd little pucker appeared on his forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When the king rode over the highway, the sun
glistened upon his,&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;again he paused. The word
looked no easier this time than when he had first read the
lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>can't</i> pronounce that word,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read the lines again, and when you come to the word that
puzzles you, pronounce it as you think it should be,&rdquo; said
Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p>The other pupils were interested, but when Reginald glanced
toward Arabella, he saw that she was smiling in evident delight at
his discomfiture. He resolved to rush through the reading in a way
that would tell her that he could read <i>anything</i>. He drew a
long breath, and then, as fast as possible, he read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When the king rode over the highway, the sun
glistened upon his <i>carrot</i> wheels!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even Aunt Charlotte smiled at the droll error, but Arabella
laughed long and loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Order, order!&rdquo; said Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The word is <i>chariot</i>,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The others read in turn, until they had finished the charming
story, and each of the girls wondered why Arabella was not reproved
for rudeness. The arithmetic lesson completed the morning's work,
and as they walked home, they talked of the new pupil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see why Aunt Charlotte didn't speak to
Arabella,&rdquo; said Nina Earl, &ldquo;she was horridly
rude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how queer she is,&rdquo; said Mollie Merton;
&ldquo;just the minute school was out she ran down the path, and
across the street to get home before any of us could talk with her.
And I <i>do</i> wonder Aunt Charlotte didn't speak to her about
laughing so loudly, just because Reginald made a mistake. I don't
believe she could read any better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess <i>perhaps</i> Arabella didn't mean to be
disagreeable,&rdquo; said Flossie Barnet.</p>

<p>She disliked Arabella, but she never could bear to hear any one
spoken of unkindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Flossie Barnet, you might just know that Arabella
<i>likes</i> to be unpleasant,&rdquo; said Jeanette, and Flossie
could not deny it.</p>

<p>Dorothy and Nancy had heard what they were saying, and they
thought that it was not at all nice of the girls to speak as if
Aunt Charlotte had allowed Arabella to be rude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Aunt Charlotte thought she wouldn't correct her
the very first day,&rdquo; Nancy said, and Nina and Mollie wished
that what they had said had not been heard.</p>

<p>Little Reginald seemed, for once, to have nothing to say.</p>

<p>He was skipping along between his cousin Katie Dean and Jeanette
Earl, and tightly grasping their hands.</p>

<p>There had been a light shower early in the morning, and here and
there a little puddle reflected the blue sky and floating clouds.
Reginald saw one just ahead, and laughed softly. Katie and Jeanette
were talking with Dorothy, and paying little heed to the small boy
who walked between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought your cousin was coming to school this
morning,&rdquo; said Dorothy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's coming the first of next week,&rdquo; said
Jeanette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is her name?&rdquo; asked Katie.</p>

<p>They were close to a fine large puddle now, and Reginald with a
hop landed both feet in the middle of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Reginald Merton Dean! You naughty boy!&rdquo; said
Katie; &ldquo;just <i>look</i> at my new shoes! See the dirty water
you've splashed on Jeanette's dress!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look at the puddle,&rdquo; exclaimed Reginald,
&ldquo;I didn't spoil the puddle; it looks just same's it did
before I jumped in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katie forgot that her question had not been answered, but
Jeanette remembered it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You asked what my cousin's name is,&rdquo; said Jeanette;
&ldquo;her name is Lola Blessington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she a peacemaker?&rdquo; asked Reginald, who still
remembered the morning's verse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&mdash;no, I mean not <i>exactly</i>,&rdquo; said
Nina, who hastened to reply before Jeanette could do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's she like?&rdquo; asked Reginald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you'll know when you see her,&rdquo; said
Jeanette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we shall see her next week,&rdquo; Katie said.</p>

<p>The sunny days slipped by, and nothing unusual happened at the
little school.</p>

<p>In that first week the other pupils learned that there was but
one way to get on peaceably with Arabella.</p>

<p>At first they followed Dorothy's example, and urged Arabella to
join them in their games, but games which they chose never pleased
her, and when Friday came, Reginald spoke his mind. They were
walking home from school, and Arabella, as usual, had turned from
her playmates, preferring to go home alone.</p>

<p>Reginald looked after her frowning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's just an old <i>fussbudget!</i>&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush!&rdquo; said Katie, &ldquo;don't you know that
we all promised Dorothy we'd be kind to Arabella?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn't say it <i>to</i> her,&rdquo; said
Reginald, &ldquo;but I'd like to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Reginald,&rdquo; said Katie, &ldquo;you know mamma
said that you were always to be a gentleman, and that you must be
'specially polite and gentle if you were to be in a class of
girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what did I <i>do</i>?&rdquo; he asked with wide
open eyes. &ldquo;I haven't touched Arabella; if she'd been a boy I
would have shaken her this morning, when she sneered and called me
a pretty boy. Boys aren't ever pretty; only girls are pretty, and
any boy would hate Arabella for saying it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They tried not to laugh, but the handsome little fellow was so
angry, and all because Arabella had called him pretty. Reginald,
who never could be angry long, joined in the general laugh which
could not be controlled.</p>

<p>Early Monday morning Dorothy and Nancy were skipping along the
avenue on their way to school.</p>

<p>Every day of the first week had been sunny, and here was Monday
with the bright blue sky overhead, and the little sunbeams dancing
on the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had every lesson perfect last week,&rdquo; said
Dorothy, &ldquo;and I mean to get &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; this week,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;and I can, if Arabella
doesn't make me do half her examples!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think she ought to,&rdquo; Dorothy said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn't <i>really</i> ask me to,&rdquo; said Nancy,
&ldquo;but it's almost the same. She says she can't do them, and
says she could if some one was kind enough to just show her how.
Then I can't seem to be unkind, and the minute I say I'll
<i>help</i> her, she pushes her slate and pencil towards me.
&lsquo;You can do 'em easier than I can,&rsquo; she says, and
instead of <i>helping</i> her, I do them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Aunt Charlotte like to have you?&rdquo; asked
Dorothy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know; I haven't told her about it yet. I don't
want to be a telltale,&rdquo; Nancy said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you don't,&rdquo; agreed Dorothy, &ldquo;but
you know Aunt Charlotte says that we are to be independent, and
Arabella's anything but independent when she doesn't do her
examples herself. It's puzzling, though; mamma says we mustn't
notice her queer ways, and that we must be kind to her, and it
doesn't seem kind to refuse to help her with her
lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait for us!&rdquo; called a merry voice, and turning,
they saw Nina and Jeanette running toward them. A third girl
clasped their hands, and Dorothy knew that she must be their
cousin, Lola Blessington.</p>

<p>She was very pretty, and she seemed so friendly that Dorothy was
really glad that she was to join the class, and Nancy was quite as
pleased. It was early for school, and Nina proposed that they sit
on the wall, and wait for Katie and Reginald.</p>

<p>They seated themselves upon the stone wall, and like a row of
sparrows, they chattered gaily.</p>

<p>Lola seemed full of fun, and she told of some fine games which
she had played at the school where she had been a pupil, and they
were all very glad that she was to be a member of the private
class.</p>

<p>And now a thin little figure made its way across the street,
just a little way from where they were sitting.</p>

<p>Nina reached behind Lola, and touched her sister's sleeve;
Jeanette nodded, and looked toward the girl who walked along,
looking down upon the ground.</p>

<p>Dorothy saw her, and called to her kindly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arabella! Arabella! Won't you come and meet our new
playmate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella turned, paused just a second to stare at the new pupil.
Then turning toward the stone cottage, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't stop to talk; I've got to go to
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how&mdash;&rdquo; Nancy would not finish the
sentence.</p>

<p>She was grieved that Arabella should be so rude to Dorothy, and
vexed that their new friend should be unkindly treated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; Lola asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's Arabella Corryville,&rdquo; said Nina, &ldquo;and
she's in our class, and I wish&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped as short
as Nancy had a few moments before.</p>

<p>Lola turned to look at Nina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you going to say?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to say that I wished she wasn't.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapIII">CHAPTER III</a></h3>

<h4>THE DIALOGUE</h4>

<p class="chapone">Lola received a cordial greeting from Aunt
Charlotte, and at recess time she declared that she was now in the
nicest school that she had ever attended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how many have you been in?&rdquo; asked Mollie;
&ldquo;this is the only one I've ever been to, and you aren't any
older than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lola laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've been in three schools,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Last
year I commenced in one school, but we moved, and I had to go to
another one. This makes the third, and I know I shall like it best
of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every one liked Lola. She seemed to be tireless. She knew many
games, and as soon as they wearied of one, she chose another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's as much fun to play with as a boy,&rdquo; said
Reginald, at which Arabella laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You like <i>any</i> girls better'n boys; you said so the
other day,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like <i>some</i> girls,&rdquo; said the small boy, and
he might have said more, but his cousin Katie stood behind
Arabella, shaking her head, and frowning at him. Reginald looked at
Katie, and decided to be silent.</p>

<p>There were ever so many things which he would have liked to say,
but Katie <i>might</i> tell at home if he were too naughty.</p>

<p>When Arabella found that Lola was liked by all the other pupils,
she decided to be just a bit friendly toward her, and Lola seemed
pleased that Arabella was no longer odd and silent.</p>

<p>And so it happened that Arabella now seemed really to be a
member of the class.</p>

<p>She no longer refused to join in their games at recess, and took
more interest in her lessons than she had before.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte was delighted, and hoped that Arabella's pleasant
mood would last.</p>

<p>There was great excitement one morning when the little class was
told that plans had been made for the first entertainment, and that
rehearsals would commence that afternoon. A little murmur of
delight passed over the class, and Aunt Charlotte smiled at their
pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall ask Dorothy to sing two songs for us; Nancy, I
know, will be willing to do a fancy dance; Nina and Jeanette are
learning a new duet for the piano, and I should be pleased to have
that for another number on our programme. I have chosen a fine
dialogue which will give a part to every girl, and also a boy's
r&ocirc;le for Reginald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Aunt Charlotte had finished speaking, there was another
little murmur of delight, and then the lessons for the day
commenced.</p>

<p>At recess they could not spare a moment for games! They talked,
and talked of the entertainment which they were to give, and of the
fine times which they would have at the afternoon rehearsals, and
after school, when they walked along the avenue, they still were
talking of the solo numbers, and of the dialogue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's eight girls in it, and one boy, that's
Reginald,&rdquo; said Mollie, &ldquo;and I know&mdash;oh, wait till
I tie my shoe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rested her foot on a stone, and tied the ribbons with a
smart little twitch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now what were you going to say?&rdquo; asked
Jeanette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>said</i> how many were to be in the dialogue, and I
was <i>going</i> to say that I know I'm just wild to hear Aunt
Charlotte read it to us this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you won't have to be wild long,&rdquo; Jeanette
said, &ldquo;for we are to come back at two to have our parts given
to us.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak">
<p>At two o'clock they were again at the cottage, eagerly watching
Aunt Charlotte, as she opened her desk, and took from it a book
with a scarlet cover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are nine girls in my class, just the number
required for this dialogue,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Eight of the
characters are school girls, one is a fairy, and the boy in the
little play is an elfin messenger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That'll be <i>me</i>, for I'm the only boy here,&rdquo;
said Reginald; &ldquo;you girls don't know <i>who'll</i> be
<i>which!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte laughed at this speech as heartily as did the
girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'll soon know who'll be which,&rdquo; said Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, because Aunt Charlotte will tell us,&rdquo; laughed
Dorothy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The directions for producing the play, speaks of the
fairy queen as being taller than the school girls, so I will give
that part to you, Jeanette, as you are a trifle taller than the
others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I'll love to be the queen,&rdquo; Jeanette said
quickly, and she glanced at her playmates with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess Dorothy expected to be the queen,&rdquo;
whispered Nina to Lola. Nina felt <i>almost</i> as proud as if she
herself had been honored.</p>

<p>It was true that Dorothy had usually been given leading parts,
but evidently she was not at all vexed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll make a fine queen, Jeanette,&rdquo; she was
saying, &ldquo;and oh, Aunt Charlotte, do tell her to let her hair
hang loose; it's 'most below her waist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely Jeanette must have her hair unbraided,&rdquo; Aunt
Charlotte agreed, &ldquo;and we must make a tiny gold crown for
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; said Nancy, and Jeanette was
delighted.</p>

<p>Of course Reginald was to be the little page, and the other
parts were assigned, Aunt Charlotte choosing for each of the girls
the part which best fitted her.</p>

<p>At first Arabella had seemed greatly interested, but as soon as
Jeanette had been chosen for the fairy queen, she left the group,
and turning toward the window, looked out into the garden.</p>

<p>Flossie called to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Arabella!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We're going to
read our dialogue now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others took their places, and Arabella turned, and slowly
joined them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will pass the book from one to another, and thus read
the little play through,&rdquo; said Aunt Charlotte, &ldquo;and I
will copy each part carefully, that each can memorize all that she
has to say. When you have learned your lines, we will have our
first rehearsal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; said Reginald, and although the girls
laughed, they were quite as eagerly delighted as he.</p>

<p>They left the cottage, and as they walked down the avenue they
talked of the pretty dialogue, each insisting that she liked her
part best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But mine's the best,&rdquo; said Reginald, &ldquo;for I'm
the only boy in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine's the best, for I'm the queen,&rdquo; said Jeanette,
and she held her head very high, as she looked toward her
playmates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>All</i> the parts are nice,&rdquo; Nancy said,
&ldquo;and we'll have a fine entertainment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella had stopped to arrange her books in her desk, and was
the last to leave the cottage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like to see that you are orderly,&rdquo; Aunt Charlotte
said, as Arabella passed her on her way to the door.</p>

<p>She made no reply, but hurried down the walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An odd child, truly,&rdquo; Aunt Charlotte said, as she
looked after the slender little figure.</p>

<p>The next day each girl received a copy of her lines, and
Wednesday of the next week was set for the first rehearsal.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak">
<p>&ldquo;I know every word I have to say,&rdquo; said Jeanette, as
she walked along toward the cottage with Katie Dean.</p>

<p>It was Wednesday morning, and the first rehearsal was set for
the afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>guess</i> I know mine, but I'm not sure. Aunt
Charlotte will have the book and she can prompt me,&rdquo; Katie
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know mine,&rdquo; boasted Reginald; &ldquo;I have to
run in right after the fairy, and say, &lsquo;Here is your magic
wand, oh, queen,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you can't say it <i>that</i> way,&rdquo; laughed
Jeanette, &ldquo;for Aunt Charlotte wouldn't let you. You said it
just as if you'd said, &lsquo;Here is a great, big sandwich, oh,
queen!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I <i>didn't</i> say that, and you needn't laugh. It
makes you feel big to be queen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Reginald!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it does,&rdquo; declared the small boy, &ldquo;an'
Arabella said so yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arabella likes to say mean things,&rdquo; said Jeanette,
&ldquo;but it doesn't prove that they're so because she says
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everything went smoothly at the afternoon rehearsal, until
Dorothy said that Nancy was to do a lovely fancy dance for one
number on the programme, when Arabella felt moved to make one of
her unpleasant remarks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Aunt Matilda doesn't 'prove of dancing,&rdquo; she
said, looking sharply at Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, your Aunt Matilda doesn't <i>have</i> to
dance,&rdquo; said Mollie, pertly.</p>

<p>Mollie knew that she was naughty, but truly Arabella was
trying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps your aunt likes music,&rdquo; said Nina;
&ldquo;Dorothy is going to sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know whether she likes singing or not,&rdquo;
Arabella replied, &ldquo;but she doesn't like dancing, I know, for
she said she wouldn't ever let me learn to dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P'r'aps your father'd let you learn,&rdquo; said
Reginald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wouldn't unless Aunt Matilda said I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why <i>does</i> folks have Aunt Matildas?&rdquo; muttered
Reginald.</p>

<p>Mollie Merton laughed. She had heard what he said, although he
had spoken almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>They left the cottage, promising to study their parts very
carefully, and as they walked down the avenue they repeated some of
the pleasing lines which they remembered.</p>

<p>Suddenly Reginald spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got to go back; I've left my ball on my desk,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't go back,&rdquo; Katie said, &ldquo;you won't want
it to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P'raps I will, and anyway I'm going after it,&rdquo; said
Reginald, stoutly; &ldquo;you wait for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can't, Reginald,&rdquo; Katie said, &ldquo;but you
can overtake us if you hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reginald was already running toward the cottage, so he did not
hear what Katie said. He pushed open the little gate and ran in,
and up the steps on to the piazza.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left my ball on my desk,&rdquo; he said to Aunt
Charlotte, who was standing in the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The schoolroom is open,&rdquo; she said with a smile, and
Reginald rushed past her, and hurried to his desk. The ball was not
on it, nor was it in the desk, as careful hunting proved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left it right on top of my desk,&rdquo; he declared to
Aunt Charlotte, who had followed, and now stood beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure of that?&rdquo; she asked gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I <i>know</i> I left it there, and I came back
on purpose to get it,&rdquo; he said, his blue eyes wide with
surprise, &ldquo;and now it is getting late to hunt for it, 'sides,
I don't know where to hunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His lip quivered, and there was something very like tears in his
eyes, although he blinked very hard to hide them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will search for the ball, and keep it for you to-morrow
morning,&rdquo; Aunt Charlotte said; &ldquo;it may have dropped to
the floor, and rolled away into some shadowy corner, or behind the
draperies. It is almost twilight now, but the lamplight to-night or
the bright daylight to-morrow will help me to find it for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus comforted, Reginald left the cottage, but although he ran
nearly all the way home, he saw neither of his schoolmates. He had
hunted so long for the coveted ball that they had reached their
homes before he was even in sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can't wait for him,&rdquo; Katie had said, as she
looked down the road to see if he were coming, and then they had
become so interested in talking of their dialogue that they forgot
all about him.</p>

<p>Usually Reginald called for his cousin Katie, but the next
morning he was so eager to learn if his ball had been found, that
he started early, intending to be the first at school, and hurried
past Katie's house lest she might call to him to wait.</p>

<p>He had almost reached the cottage when he remembered that he had
left both his spelling-book and reader at home.</p>

<p>It was really provoking, and for just a moment he paused,
wondering if he might borrow books, or if indeed he ought to return
for his own.</p>

<p>It was only a few days before that Aunt Charlotte had spoken of
promptness at school, and at the same time said that only a
careless pupil would be obliged to borrow.</p>

<p>He would not be the first to be thought careless; he would run
back to the house, but he must hurry, or be late.</p>

<p>There was a field that he could cross, and thus save a little
time, he thought, but when half-way across it he found that he was
losing, instead of gaining time. The uneven ground and coarse grass
were much harder to run over than the fine, hard surface of the
avenue, and in his haste he stumbled along over sticks and rough
places, reaching the house flushed and tired.</p>

<p>He found his books just where he had left them and hurried past
the maid, who was surprised to see him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Master Reginald, I thought I see yer go out to
school some time ago,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to come back after my books,&rdquo; he replied,
looking over his shoulder as he ran down the walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't go across that little old field,&rdquo; he said
in disgust. &ldquo;It must have taken twice as long to go that
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he ran along the avenue, and soon neared the bend of the road
where, between trees and shrubbery, he could see a bit of the
cottage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be the only one that's late,&rdquo; he thought, when
at that moment he noticed some one farther along the avenue.</p>

<p>It was Arabella Corryville, but what was she doing?</p>

<p>He drew back, and stood behind a bush which overhung the
sidewalk and partly hid him.</p>

<p>Arabella was looking over the low wall,&mdash;ah, now she was
reaching down as if trying to get something that was hard to reach,
or was she dropping something over?</p>

<p class="illus"><a name="illus064" href="images/Illus064.jpg"
target="_blank"><img src="images/Illus064s.jpg" alt=
"She was reaching down as if to get something" width="340" height=
"420"></a><br>
She was reaching down as if to get something.</p>

<p>Reginald could not guess which she was doing, and he knew that
if he asked her, she would not tell him.</p>

<p>Now Arabella was running; Reginald ran, too. He knew that he
must be quite late, for none of the other pupils were in sight.</p>

<p>He was a swift runner, and he entered the door just as Arabella
was about to close it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're late, too,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>The little pupils were singing, and the two went softly to their
seats.</p>

<p>After the singing, Aunt Charlotte questioned Reginald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I started early, but I forgot my books, and going back
for them made me late. I ran 'most all the way; I meant to be here
early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being late for such a reason as that is excusable,&rdquo;
said Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, also, were late, Arabella.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to help my Aunt Matilda,&rdquo; said Arabella, as
glibly as if it had been true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oo! That's a fib!&rdquo; whispered Reginald, but
Arabella did not hear him.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte said nothing, but she thought it strange that
Arabella's aunt should have detained her. Surely the maid could
have given all necessary assistance, rather than force the little
daughter of the house to be late at school.</p>

<p>Reginald had longed to peep over that wall, but he dared not
linger. What had Arabella been doing? He determined to wait until
he had a fine chance, and then he would look over that wall. He
believed that she had hidden something there. He would not tell the
other girls, for they might tell Arabella.</p>

<p>At recess time he asked Aunt Charlotte if she had found his
ball.</p>

<p>No, the ball was not in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you must have been mistaken,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;the ball must be at your home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly I had it here,&rdquo; the boy insisted, &ldquo;I
left it on my desk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have gone to find my red book which had our
dialogue in it, for that has disappeared, and hunt as I will, I
cannot find it. You have your parts carefully copied, and can be
learning them, but I need the book to prompt you.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapIV">CHAPTER IV</a></h3>

<h4>AN ENTERTAINMENT</h4>

<p class="chapone">Reginald knew that the ball had been on his desk
when he had left the schoolroom, and he could not think how it
could have disappeared unless some one had helped it to do so.</p>

<p>Again he searched in his desk, but the ball was not there. He
put away the books which he had taken out, and closed his desk,
looking up just in time to see that Arabella was closely watching
him. How queer she looked! She was not laughing, but she seemed to
be amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I b'lieve I know where my ball is,&rdquo; he whispered;
&ldquo;I just know Arabella took it, and p'r'aps that was what she
dropped over the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; whispered Arabella, but
Reginald only shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I won't tell her,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;but
right after school I'll look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When school was out he lingered, hoping that the girls would
hurry off, and thus leave him free to search behind the wall where
he believed Arabella had hidden his ball.</p>

<p>It was useless to wait. The girls sat upon the wall talking
until Reginald was out of patience, and when at last they started
for home, Katie insisted that he must go with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know mamma said that we were to hurry home from
school,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You weren't hurrying when you were sitting on this
wall,&rdquo; said Reginald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I forgot, so I'm hurrying now,&rdquo; Katie replied,
and grasping his hand, she commenced to run very fast, laughing
because he looked so unwilling.</p>

<p>That night there was a heavy shower that drenched the trees and
left clear little puddles in the road.</p>

<p>Reginald reached the cottage just in time to avoid being
late.</p>

<p>The lessons went smoothly until the readers were opened. It was
a charming story, but there were many long words which puzzled the
pupils.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The water nymphs paused in the moonlight to watch the
fountain spray,&rdquo; was the opening sentence of the paragraph
which Reginald was to read, but the letters were spaced so that the
s and p were not close together in &ldquo;spray.&rdquo; Reginald
read it as it appeared:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The water nymphs paused in the moonlight to watch
the fountains pray.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how could they?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how could
fountains <i>pray</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The class was amused, but Arabella laughed long and loudly, and
Aunt Charlotte was obliged to speak forcibly to her to check her
merriment. The small boy was angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll get even with her; see 'f I don't,&rdquo; he
thought.</p>

<p>Indeed he could hardly wait to punish Arabella for her
rudeness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I leave the yard?&rdquo; he asked at recess time,
&ldquo;I've thought of one place I'd like to hunt for my
ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was off like a flash, and the girls returned to their
game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's your turn, Dorothy,&rdquo; Nancy said, and Dorothy
entered the ring.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;From this ring that has no end<br>
You may choose a little friend,&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p class="cont">sang the merry voices, and Dorothy looked from one
to another. She would have liked to choose Nancy, but she thought
how few of the girls <i>ever</i> chose Arabella, and she held out
her hand to the playmate who seldom was favored.</p>

<p>If Arabella was pleased she did not show it. She took her place
in the ring, however, and looked at the merry faces that circled
around her.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;You are next the favored guest,<br>
Choose the friend you love the best.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Choose?&rdquo; How <i>could</i> she choose? She never
liked to do a pleasant thing for any one, and whomever she called
into the ring would feel favored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry, and choose some one, Arabella,&rdquo; called
Mollie Merton, but still Arabella stood sullenly staring at her
shoes.</p>

<p>Mollie was ready again to urge Arabella to choose, when the gate
flew open, and Reginald, breathless and excited, rushed in. Aunt
Charlotte was standing in the walk, watching the pretty game.
Reginald ran to her, holding out something very wet and
dripping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't find my ball, but I guess this is the di'logue
book you couldn't find,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The red and gold cover was blistered, and its fine color had
almost disappeared.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte looked her surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down behind the wall, where I saw somebody drop
it,&rdquo; he said, looking sharply at Arabella.</p>

<p>Of course they all looked at Arabella, who hesitated for a
moment, then pushing past the girls, she ran down the walk to the
gate, looking over her shoulder to call to Aunt Charlotte:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got to go home, 'cause my head aches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Aunt Charlotte will do about the
book?&rdquo; whispered Mollie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what <i>could</i> she do?&rdquo; Flossie asked in
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Flossie Barnet! You saw the cover all spoiled. Don't
you s'pose she'll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mollie's question was hushed by the silvery tinkle of the
bell which told that recess was over.</p>

<p>Arabella did not return for the afternoon rehearsal, but she
entered the class-room on the next morning as calmly as if nothing
had happened, and she seemed very eager to show her interest in the
dialogue by appearing at all the other rehearsals.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak">
<p>Exhibition day had arrived, and parents and friends were seated
before the tiny stage, waiting for the curtain to rise.</p>

<p>Dorothy had sung two songs very sweetly, Nancy had danced for
them, and had charmed them with her grace, Nina and Jeanette had
played a duet, and now, yes, the curtain was rising!</p>

<p>Every one leaned forward to catch the first glimpse of the
stage-setting, and in the midst of the excitement, a small, prim
figure entered the room, and made its way toward the only seat
which was still unoccupied. It was beside Flossie's Uncle Harry,
and as the woman took the seat he turned, and then moved to make
extra room for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That <i>must</i> be Arabella's Aunt Matilda!&rdquo; he
whispered to his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush-sh-sh!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It not only <i>must</i> be, but it <i>is!</i>&rdquo; he
declared, and he offered her his programme.</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda was not wholly pleased with his courtesy, and had
half a mind to refuse it, but few could resist his winning smile,
and reluctantly she kept it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Matilda looks as if she were angry because she is
not included in the dialogue,&rdquo; whispered Uncle Harry, to
which his lovely young wife replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She'll hear you, if you aren't careful; now <i>do</i>
give your attention to the stage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm simply <i>all</i> ears,&rdquo; he whispered, and at
that moment, the children ran on, entering from either side.</p>

<p>The pretty scene represented a little grove, in which the school
girls had gathered to summon the queen of the fairies, who might
grant the dearest wish of each.</p>

<p>The first fairy to appear was Green Feather, an elfin page or
messenger, and Reginald made a perfect sprite, in his green suit,
and cap with a long, green quill.</p>

<p>He took the message which the girls wished to send to the queen,
and then hurried away to summon her, while the school girls chanted
a magic verse which should aid her to appear quickly.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Fairy queen, we wait for thee,<br>
Willing subjects we will be.<br>
Come! Thou'lt find us at thy feet,<br>
We would beg, ay, and entreat<br>
That our wishes thou wilt hear,<br>
When thou dost indeed appear.<br>
Now we draw a magic ring,<br>
&lsquo;Come, fair queen,&rsquo; we gaily sing.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>With a silver-tipped wand they drew a circle upon the ground,
and scarcely was it finished when Jeanette ran out from between the
mimic trees, and sprang into the circle, a dazzling figure, all
white and silver, and blue. Upon her long, dark hair rested a tiny
gold crown, and in her hand she carried a gold wand which was wound
with strings of pearls.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Thou, with voice so silvery clear,<br>
I your dearest wish will hear.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>As Jeanette spoke the lines she held her wand above Dorothy's
head.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Song! Ah, let me always sing<br>
For the peasant, or the king,<br>
For the ones I hold most dear,<br>
For all hearts that I may cheer,&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p class="cont">sang Dorothy, in her clear, light little treble,
and very winning she looked, as she extended her hand toward the
fairy whom she implored to grant her wish.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Sing you shall, in tones so clear<br>
That the very birds shall hear,<br>
And, in envy, cease their lay<br>
While your melody holds sway.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>As Jeanette chanted the verse, she waved her wand, and Dorothy,
entering the circle beside her, sang a fairy song which delighted
all who listened.</p>

<p>The woman beside Uncle Harry seemed ill at ease, crumpling her
programme, and moving restlessly upon her seat as if the little
play bored her.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry stooped, and picked up the fan which had dropped
from her lap. She looked at him as if she thought that he had
intended to steal it, then, relenting, she screwed her thin lips
into something like a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank ye,&rdquo; she said, as she took the fan, and
glanced at his pleasant face.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry wished that she would speak again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish she'd give us some of her
&lsquo;<i>views</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; he whispered to his wife,
&ldquo;Arabella says she has plenty of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Harry, hush, unless you want her to hear
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't mind,&rdquo; he whispered, his blue eyes
twinkling with merriment.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, the fairy queen seated herself upon her
woodland throne, and as the girls knelt before her, the red curtain
rolled slowly down, hiding the little stage.</p>

<p>The first act was finished, and now, in the few moments before
the curtain would rise, the buzz of voices whispered approval of
the pretty play.</p>

<p>Arabella's prim little aunt looked furtively toward her
neighbor. He smiled encouragingly, and she ventured to speak.</p>

<p>She was a little old lady and he was tall and stalwart; his
handsome face was youthful, and she wished him to know that she
thought him a mere boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man, do you approve of this play-acting?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, surely,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Who would care to
see professionals, if he might, instead, see children <i>trying</i>
to act?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She eyed him sharply to learn if he were joking, but his manner
was so dignified that she did not dream that he was amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think if we had these exhibitions often the
children would grow to be just too pert for anything. I have my
views about play-acting, and as my niece is a pupil here, I'm just
a little anxious about how this school is run. Have you any small
sisters here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>His eyes were dancing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've no small sisters,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and as my
little daughter is but nine months old, I've not yet sent her to
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your daughter? Well, I declare! Why, I thought you were
an overgrown boy!&rdquo; she said, bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! That's what my wife frequently calls me,&rdquo; he
said, and from his manner one might have thought that he deeply
regretted the fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your wife is here, young man, I should think she'd see
you talking to that pretty girl beside you,&rdquo; said the little
woman, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she rather likes it,&rdquo; he said, with a soft
laugh, &ldquo;you see that pretty girl is my wife.&rdquo; Aunt
Matilda stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn't you like to meet her?&rdquo; he asked;
&ldquo;this is such a very informal gathering that I might venture
to present her, if only I knew your name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm Arabella Corryville's aunt,&rdquo; she said, without
realizing that that was not telling her name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vera,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;allow me to present you to
Arabella's aunt; madam, this is my wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies bowed, and the younger woman spoke very cordially,
then the curtain went up and every eye turned toward the stage.</p>

<p>It was in the last act that Arabella entered from the right, and
all were surprised when in a clear voice, and with appropriate
gestures, she spoke her lines, making quite as good an impression
as any of her schoolmates.</p>

<p>During the early part of the dialogue Arabella had not been on
the little stage, and her doting aunt felt injured, because she
believed that the other children had been given the most important
parts. She had expressed her disapproval of
&ldquo;play-acting&rdquo; to Uncle Harry.</p>

<p>Now all was different; Arabella had appeared, had spoken well,
and the applause which she received completely changed Aunt
Matilda's mind.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Granted our wishes,<br>
Happy hearts have we;<br>
True to our fairy queen<br>
Ever we'll be,&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p class="cont">sang the children, and then once more the red
curtain hid the tiny stage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On second thoughts, I guess play-acting is rather a fine
thing if it's well done,&rdquo; Aunt Matilda said, &ldquo;an' I
guess my Arabella did 'bout as well as any of 'em. I shouldn't
wonder if she could be a great actress if she chose. Not that I'd
want her to be one; no <i>indeed</i>, but it's pleasant to think
that she could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; said Uncle Harry. &ldquo;It would
be most delightful if we could be <i>sure</i> that, at ten minutes'
notice, Arabella could become the world's greatest actress; that by
gently beckoning to him, the most obdurate theatrical manager would
bow abjectly before her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess so,&rdquo; the prim little woman said, not
quite understanding his meaning, but thinking the speech, as a
whole, rather grand.</p>

<p>The little entertainment had been a success, and Aunt Charlotte
received very warm congratulations for the fine work which her
little pupils had done.</p>

<p>As they strolled homeward, the guests talked of the numbers
which had most delighted them.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry, wag that he was, had found Aunt Matilda quite as
amusing as the music, the pretty dance which Nancy had contributed,
or the fairy dialogue. He was expecting every moment that his young
wife would gently upbraid him for his raillery, and he had not long
to wait. As they turned in at their own gateway, she looked up at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have a merry heart,
and I would not for the world have you more quiet, but sometimes
you carry your jokes too far. Dear, will you tell me why you did
not mention that strange woman's name? You introduced her as
Arabella's aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, that's who she said she was; she didn't tell me
her name, so how could I tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did not tell her <i>my</i> name; you introduced
me as your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, surely you <i>are</i> my wife; as she omitted to
state what <i>her</i> name was, I wouldn't tell her <i>yours</i>.
Simply evening things up, that's all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an idea!&rdquo; she said, but she could not help
laughing at his little joke.</p>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapV">CHAPTER V</a></h3>

<h4>THE RETURN OF PATRICIA</h4>

<p class="chapone">Of course they talked and talked of their
entertainment, of their fine audience, of the applause, and the
delight of their friends.</p>

<p>They were on their way to school one morning, Nina, Jeanette,
and their cousin, Lola Blessington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy Ferris danced just <i>beautifully</i>,&rdquo; said
Lola, &ldquo;I wonder where she learned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; Jeanette said, sullenly.</p>

<p>She had envied the applause which Nancy's graceful dancing had
evoked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jeanette,&rdquo; exclaimed Nina, &ldquo;you
<i>do</i> know that Nancy learned to dance in New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't know <i>who</i> taught her, and that's
probably what Lola meant,&rdquo; Jeanette retorted sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;New York!&rdquo; said Lola. &ldquo;Why, I remember a
little girl I saw once at the theatre, who danced so gracefully
that I thought she must be a fairy. She seemed ever so much like
Nancy, but she had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, Nancy,&rdquo; called Jeanette, sharply,
&ldquo;Lola says she saw a girl once, at a theatre in New York, who
danced and looked like you. What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Jeanette!</i>&rdquo; cried Nina, surprised that her
sister should be so eager to tease Nancy, but Nancy did not seem
annoyed.</p>

<p>She looked straight into Jeanette's flashing eyes, as she said,
quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Lola did see me dance; I was in New
York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn't say it was you who danced at the theatre. I
said the little girl was like you, but I remember now her hair was
yellow,&rdquo; Lola said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wore a wig of long yellow curls,&rdquo; Nancy said,
&ldquo;and I had to dance whether I wished to or not; Uncle Steve
made me. Oh, I was not happy there. I was never so happy as when
I've been with dear Aunt Charlotte, and Dorothy. Let's talk about
something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jeanette felt a bit ashamed. Nina wished that her sister had not
been so rude, and for a few moments neither could think of anything
to say, but just at that moment Dorothy joined them, and soon they
were talking as gaily as before.</p>

<p>Then Katie and Reginald came hurrying along the avenue, and a
moment later Mollie Merton and Flossie Barnet, and soon they were
all chattering like a flock of sparrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say! Just listen to me a minute,&rdquo; shouted Reginald,
&ldquo;I've got something great to tell you, but I can't until
you'll hark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? What is it?&rdquo; cried the eager
voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's just this,&rdquo; he said with much importance:
&ldquo;My mamma called on Aunt Charlotte yesterday, and while they
were talking 'bout our school Aunt Charlotte said that the big
girls would begin to study history this week, and my brother Bob
says it'll be all 'bout cutting folks' heads off. I guess it'll
scare girls to study that. 'Twould scare me, and <i>I'm</i> a
boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Reginald Dean!&rdquo; cried Katie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My middle name's Merton,&rdquo; said the small boy,
coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Reginald Merton Dean, then,&rdquo; Katie said,
&ldquo;and whatever your name is, you ought not to tell things like
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like what? Like learning 'bout folks choppin' off other
folks' heads? Well, I guess it's so if my big brother says
so,&rdquo; Reginald replied.</p>

<p>The girls did not believe it, but they could not deny it. They
knew that Reginald <i>thought</i> what he said was true, but they
believed that, in some way, the facts had become twisted.</p>

<p>They were at the cottage door now, and as they entered Reginald
whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just see, Katie Dean! I tell you Bob
knows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The early morning lessons were the same as usual, and the girls
soon forgot what Reginald had said, and at recess there were so
many games to be played that there was little time for talking.</p>

<p>It was after recess that the surprise came. The reading lesson
had been unusually interesting, and instead of twenty minutes, it
had occupied a half-hour.</p>

<p>When the readers were put aside, Aunt Charlotte said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Commencing to-morrow, we shall devote a half-hour to
studying history. You are all much younger than the pupils in the
public schools who begin to study history, but we shall take it up
in an easy, enjoyable way. I shall read to you from a finely
written volume which I own, while you will try to write, from
memory, what I have read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; whispered Reginald.
&ldquo;<i>Now</i> I guess you'll hear 'bout folks with their heads
off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katie put her hands over her ears, but Reginald's eyes were
twinkling with delight. The girls would have to admit that his
scrap of news was true!</p>

<p>As they hastened down the long avenue after school, he again
asked his question:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, girls! What did I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said we'd got to learn horrid things, and Aunt
Charlotte didn't say so,&rdquo; said Mollie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know she didn't, but Bob did, and you wait,&rdquo; was
the quick reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I'll</i> tell you something that you'd hardly believe,
but it's <i>true</i>,&rdquo; said Mollie; &ldquo;it's somebody
that's coming right here to Merrivale to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it somebody you know?&rdquo; Dorothy asked.</p>

<p>Mollie laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody we <i>all</i> know,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she nice? Do we like her?&rdquo; Nina questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you who it is, and then you'll know whether
you're glad or not,&rdquo; said Mollie.</p>

<p>She had been walking backward, and in front of her playmates,
and thus she could watch their faces. She looked at them an
instant, then she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's&mdash;<i>Patricia Lavine!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little group stood stock still, and it was quite evident
that not one of the party was delighted.</p>

<p>Nancy was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you <i>sure</i>, Mollie?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said so,&rdquo; Mollie replied. &ldquo;I was running
across the lawn to call for Flossie, when I heard some one
call:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mollie! Mollie! Mollie Merton!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I turned, and there was Patricia running up the walk. You
know she was always in a rush, and she's just the same now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can't stop but a minute,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;but I've just time to tell you that we've been hunting
houses, and we're coming here to live. We've got a house right next
to the big schoolhouse, and that's nice, for I wouldn't want to go
to private school.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she ran off, just looking over her shoulder to
say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I've got to hurry, for I've an engagement, but
I'll be over to see you all soon.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish she <i>wouldn't,</i>&rdquo; said Reginald,
stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she's pleasanter than when she lived here
before,&rdquo; ventured Flossie, looking up into the faces of her
playmates.</p>

<p>Dear little girl, the youngest of the group, she was ever ready
to say a kind word for an absent playmate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She <i>looked</i> just the same,&rdquo; said Mollie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she said she was to live next to the big schoolhouse,
that is just <i>miles</i> from here,&rdquo; Jeanette said,
&ldquo;so she wouldn't be likely to come over here very
often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Tisn't any farther than where she lived before,&rdquo;
said Nina, &ldquo;and she came often enough then.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak">
<p>Aunt Charlotte had chosen wisely, when she had decided to
interest her young pupils in history, by reading aloud from a
volume in which the facts were set forth in story form, and there
was one pupil who listened more intently than any of the
others.</p>

<p>One glance at Reginald's earnest little face would have
convinced any one that he was wildly interested.</p>

<p>His round, blue eyes never left Aunt Charlotte's face while she
was reading. The story of Ponce de Leon's search for the fountain
of youth was more exciting than any fairy tale that he had ever
heard. He saw no pathos in the old Spaniard's useless search. The
picture which the history painted for him showed only the little
band of swarthy men following their handsome, white-haired leader
through the wild, unexplored South, their picturesque, gaily
colored costumes gleaming in the sunlight.</p>

<p>How brilliant the pageant! How brave, how valiant they must have
appeared! Even the gorgeous wild flowers paled with chagrin as the
bold, venturesome Spaniards trampled them underfoot as they marched
steadily onward, hoping yet to find the crystal fountain which
should grant to them eternal youth.</p>

<p>When Aunt Charlotte ceased reading, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, take your pencils, and write all that you remember
of what I have read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How their pencils flew! In a short time their papers were ready,
and the little pupils proved that they had been attentive, many of
the sketches giving the story almost word for word. Of course the
older girls had written most accurately, but a few lines which
little Flossie Barnet had written showed her tender, loving
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry for the poor old Spanyard, for a fountane like
that wouldn't be <i>anywhere</i>, so I wish he and his brave men
had sailed across the sea and land to hunt for something that he
could truly find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some faulty spelling, but no error in the loving, tender heart.
The pathos of the story had touched her.</p>

<p>Reginald was but a few months older than Flossie, but he was not
sensitive, and only the adventure, the beauty described appealed to
him. He looked at Flossie in surprise when she had finished reading
her little sketch, and wondered that she could see anything
pathetic in the tale.</p>

<p>Then he rose to read his own effort at story-telling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They tramped and tramped for miles through the trees and
swamps, and I'd like to have worn a red velvet coat and hunt for
that fountane, for if we hadn't found it we'd have had a jolly
hunt. I'd like to have worn a red velvet coat and a big hat with
fethers on it, and a pare of boots with big tops to them. We could
have tramped better with those big boots and all those fine things
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A droll idea, truly. No wonder that the girls laughed at the
vanity which Reginald had so innocently betrayed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get your description of his costume?&rdquo;
Aunt Charlotte asked. She could not help smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From a painting in my uncle's hall,&rdquo; said Reginald,
promptly, &ldquo;and when I told him that I wished that men wore
clothes like that now, he just laughed, and said he thought those
huge, long-plumed hats would be an awful nuisance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older girls were soon to study English history, and they
felt very important indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We're bigger than Flossie and Katie and Reginald,&rdquo;
said Jeanette, &ldquo;so we are to have an extra study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wouldn't want what you're going to have,&rdquo;
Reginald said, &ldquo;for it's just horrid. I told you my brother
Bob said it was all full of chopping folks' heads off, and you
didn't believe it, Jeanette Earl, but you'll find out it's so; you
see 'f you don't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flossie slipped her hand into Reginald's, as if for
protection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wouldn't like to study it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
we won't like to hear it, but we'll have to when they say their
lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dorothy and Nancy had been obliged to hurry home from school.
They were to drive with Mrs. Dainty and Aunt Charlotte, and Mrs.
Dainty had told them to be prompt.</p>

<p>Flossie and Reginald lingered after the others had gone. He
gathered some blossoming weeds which grew near the cottage,
thinking thus to cheer her, and to turn her mind from the hated
English history.</p>

<p>She took the flowers, and for a time she laughed and talked so
brightly that she seemed her sunny self.</p>

<p>He was just thinking how happy she looked when suddenly she
leaned toward him, and said earnestly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you s'pose Bob was mistaken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reginald hesitated. He ardently admired Bob, but he also cared
for dear little Flossie, and longed to please her, so after a pause
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My big brother knows <i>'most everything</i>, but just
<i>p'r'aps</i> he might have been mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not much comfort, but it was better than if Reginald had
insisted that Bob's knowledge was absolute.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Dainty's carriage bowled along the avenue, the trees
seemed ablaze with autumn splendor, for the leaves that danced in
the sunlight were scarlet and gold, and the sunbeams flickered and
shimmered like merry elves.</p>

<p>The light breeze tossed the plumes on Dorothy's hat, and blew
her golden curls about her lovely little face.</p>

<p>She leaned back in the carriage and laid her hand in Nancy's.
Nancy's fingers were quick to clasp Dorothy's, and for a time they
sat listening to what Mrs. Dainty and Aunt Charlotte Grayson were
saying.</p>

<p>Then something made Nancy turn. A little figure was mincing
along the avenue; its shoes had very high heels, its stockings were
pink, and its dress a bright green. A showy hat with many-colored
flowers crowned its head, and as the carriage passed it waved a
lace handkerchief, thus setting her many bangles tinkling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That <i>was</i> Patricia Lavine,&rdquo; said Nancy;
&ldquo;Mollie Merton said she saw her just a few days
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O dear!&rdquo; said Dorothy, &ldquo;and it's not nice to
say that when Patricia has just come back here to live, but truly
she wasn't pleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't wonder you said, &lsquo;O dear,&rsquo; for
wherever she was, she made somebody uncomfortable,&rdquo; Nancy
said, which was indeed true.</p>

<p>Patricia was not wholly at fault. She dearly loved anything that
was showy, and her mother, who was a very ignorant woman, was quite
as fond of display.</p>

<p>She had never taught her little daughter to be kind or
courteous, but instead had laughed at her pert ways, and thought
them amusing.</p>

<p>Patricia hastened along the avenue as fast as her little steeple
heels would permit, and when she saw Flossie and Reginald, she
rushed toward them, assuring them that she <i>never</i> had been so
glad to see any one before.</p>

<p>Neither Flossie nor Reginald could say that they were quite as
pleased, but Patricia did not wait for them to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've been living in N' York,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
we're going to live here now, an' we've got a el'gant house right
next the schoolhouse. Ma says it's one of the finest houses in
Merrivale, an' I guess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it's next to the schoolhouse it's the one where our
cook's brother lives,&rdquo; remarked Reginald. &ldquo;He lives on
the first floor, and the man that drives the water-cart lives just
over him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia was annoyed. She had wished them to think that the
entire house had been engaged for her own small family.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were flushed, but she made the best of the situation,
and at once commenced to tell of the beauties of the flat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We lived in a great big hotel in N' York,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but ma says this flat is handsomer than the one what
we had at the hotel. Ma says I can give a party this winter, if I
want to. Of course I'll invite <i>all</i> my N' York friends, but I
shall only ask the girls here that have been nice to me, and I
don't think I shall ask <i>any</i> boys at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cast a withering glance at Reginald, who whistled softly.
Then he made a naughty reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;P'r'aps the boys wouldn't come if you asked them,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Reginald!&rdquo; said Flossie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she said a mean thing 'bout not inviting boys, else
I wouldn't have said it. I wouldn't speak like that to you or
Dorothy, or any of the nice girls I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were nice boys in N' York,&rdquo; snapped Patricia.
&ldquo;I didn't see a boy while I was there who wasn't <i>very</i>
nice.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapVI">CHAPTER VI</a></h3>

<h4>WHAT FLOSSIE DID</h4>

<p class="chapone">In the great hall, at the Barnet house, the
butler stood puzzling over the letters which the postman had
left.</p>

<p>He dared not meddle with them, but he paused for a moment to
study them as they lay upon his salver, while he wondered if the
handwriting upon either envelope were in the least familiar.</p>

<p>The little French maid, peering over the baluster, laughed
softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M'sieur is curious, but he should not delay. The
lettairs, it may be, of importance are, and the madam already
waiting is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a soft, yet merry laugh, the maid returned to dress her
mistress's hair, and the burly butler stalked up the stairway,
angry that Marie should have seen him studying the letters, and
annoyed by her saucy laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That girl is always 'round,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>It was Saturday morning, and although it was October, it was as
warm as a June day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barnet was in the hands of the French maid, and could not
be disturbed while her hair was being dressed.</p>

<p>Flossie wondered what she could find to play with.</p>

<p>She wished that Saturday had been a schoolday.</p>

<p>Usually she found the baby amusing, but Uncle Harry's little
daughter was out for an airing.</p>

<p>The kitten skurried down the hall and Flossie caught her, and
ran off to the music-room.</p>

<p>She managed to clamber up on to the stool with pussy in her
arms, and reached for the music, which she opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that's a <i>very</i> nice song, kitty,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but you needn't sing it; you can just practise the
'comfrement. Now one, two, three, begin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held the kitten's paws, and forced them to press the
keys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me-u! Me-u!&rdquo; squeaked wee pussy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You going to sing and play, too? Why, that's fine,&rdquo;
said Flossie, &ldquo;only you don't get the tune right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me-u! Me-u!&rdquo; wailed the white kitten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now pussy darling, you're real sweet to <i>try</i>, but
you don't sing the tune right; it didn't sound like <i>that</i>
when Uncle Harry sang it last night. We'll sing it together, and
maybe you'll learn it. Put your left paw on <i>do</i>, and your
right paw on <i>mi</i>; now sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="illus"><a name="illus113" href="images/Illus113.jpg"
target="_blank"><img src="images/Illus113s.jpg" alt=
"'Put your left paw on _do_, and your right paw on _mi_; now sing.'"
 width="338" height="426"></a><br>
&ldquo;Put your left paw on <i>do</i>, and your right paw on
<i>mi</i>; now sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What a droll duet it was! Franz Abt's beautiful song was never
before thus rendered.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;I love thee, dearest, thee alone,<br>
Love thee, and only thee!&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p class="cont">sang Flossie, while little pussy, regardless of
time or sentiment, sang &ldquo;me-u! me-<i>ow!</i> me-u!
<i>me-u!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our voices don't <i>har-mer-lize</i>, pussy, I know they
don't. You'll just have to practise alone. That's what Mollie
Merton's mamma said last night when Uncle Harry and Aunt Vera sang
together. She said: &lsquo;Oh, how beautifully their voices
<i>har-mer-lize</i>.&rsquo; Now that's just what our voices
<i>don't</i> do, so I'll put you right on to the keys, and you can
practise the <i>'comfrement</i> alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flossie ran to the window to see if any of her playmates were in
sight, while the kitten, left to amuse herself, walked slowly
across the keyboard, and sat down upon the lower bass notes.</p>

<p>The French maid paused in the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it is the petite beast that the bad music makes. I
will the feline terrible remove, before she more mischief does
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't take the kitten out, Marie,&rdquo; cried Flossie,
&ldquo;I'm making her practise her lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, bien! In this great mansion where all do so much
learning have, even the petite cat must an education get! What more
astounding could one behold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to make her learn the song Uncle Harry sang last
night. Did you hear him sing, Marie? Wasn't his voice
sweet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well did I the music hear. The sweet sounds did up
the stairway float, and I did say: &lsquo;He is one beau gallant!
His voice the rock would melt! Many hearts he must broken have
before he loved Madame Vera who now his wife is.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know what you mean, Marie,&rdquo; Flossie said,
&ldquo;but I do know I <i>love</i> him, and I love to hear him
sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I could listen the day and the night when he music
makes,&rdquo; the maid replied, and Flossie was satisfied.</p>

<p>A moment later Mollie, in great excitement, ran over to call for
Flossie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you know, Dorothy's mamma told my mamma that
there's to be a great party at the stone house, and all of
Dorothy's friends are to be invited. Now aren't you glad I came
over to tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When is it to be? I guess I am glad, Mollie Merton, and
so will everybody be. When is the party to be?&rdquo; she repeated,
her blue eyes shining, and her little feet restlessly dancing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know just when, but I guess it's pretty soon, and
it's to be different from any party we ever went to. I don't know
just <i>how</i> different; that part is a secret, but we are to
know as soon as the invitations are ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we <i>'most</i> can't wait,&rdquo; said Flossie.</p>

<p>Of course the delightful news travelled, and by Monday morning
every child in town knew that there was to be a grand party at the
great stone house, but no one could find out just what sort of
party it was to be. Even Dorothy could not enlighten them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's to be fine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and different
from any party I ever had, but mamma doesn't wish me to tell
anything about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't she let you tell Nancy?&rdquo; questioned Katie
Dean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy knows <i>now</i>!&rdquo; declared Reginald;
&ldquo;just look at her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed Nancy's dark eyes were merry, and her voice rippled with
laughter, as she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>do</i> know, and I'm going to keep the secret, but
it's the hardest one I ever tried to keep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At recess they walked arm-in-arm, talking of the party instead
of playing games. They were chattering so gaily that they heard no
one approach, and when suddenly Patricia Lavine peeped over the
wall, they were startled, and wondered how she could have appeared
without any one having seen her coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Patricia! Where'd you come from?&rdquo; said
Mollie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was walking along and came over because I heard you
talking. Whose party is it going to be?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dorothy is to have the party,&rdquo; said Jeanette,
&ldquo;but why aren't you in school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why aren't <i>you?</i>&rdquo; Patricia asked with a saucy
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's recess time at <i>our</i> school,&rdquo; said
Nina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it's recess time at <i>ours</i>, too,&rdquo;
Patricia replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you're a long way from your school,&rdquo; Reginald
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; queried Patricia, &ldquo;well, I don't have
to go to school every single day, as <i>some</i> folks do,&rdquo;
she retorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know 'most all the tables now, and I know a little
geog-er-fry, and 'most half of the history, 'cause some of it I
learned when I was in N' York. We had a el'gant school there, and
ma says I learned so much that I needn't go to school every day
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Flossie looked quite impressed, but the older girls were
not so sure that Patricia had gained so much knowledge.</p>

<p>No one spoke, and Patricia thought that they were all much
surprised at what she had said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's to be visitors at our school to-day, and teacher
said she was going to let them ask questions,&rdquo; she
continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you stayed away so as not to tell all you
know,&rdquo; said Reginald.</p>

<p>Katie nudged him sharply, but he only twitched away, laughing
because Patricia looked angry.</p>

<p>The little silver bell tinkled, and they turned to enter the
cottage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; they called to Patricia, who stood at the
gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; she replied, then looking over her
shoulder, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm glad I don't have to go to private school; it's too
stupid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The horrid, rude girl,&rdquo; whispered Nina Earl, but
Arabella surprised them all by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I'd like that Patricia What's-her-name; she isn't
like everybody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reginald heard what Arabella said, and in a loud whisper
informed her that he wouldn't go to school if <i>all</i> the girls
were like Patricia.</p>

<p>Arabella would have answered him sharply, but they were entering
the schoolroom, so she was obliged to be silent.</p>

<p>Later, when they were asked to write upon the little blackboard,
Arabella looked for a chance to tease Reginald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he does anything that I can laugh at, I'll laugh till
he's mad as a hornet,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>It happened that Reginald was the first to go to the board.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte asked for a sentence which should contain but
five words, and yet tell a bit of news.</p>

<p>Every hand was raised.</p>

<p>Dorothy intended to write: &ldquo;Nancy is a true friend,&rdquo;
while Nancy thought that this would be interesting: &ldquo;Dorothy
will have a party,&rdquo; but Reginald felt sure that he had
thought of the smartest sentence, and his face beamed with delight
when he was told that he might write it.</p>

<p>He glanced toward Arabella as he strutted to the blackboard, and
boldly he wrote:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phido has a new collar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was funny, and Reginald wondered why even Aunt Charlotte
looked amused. Every one knew Fido, and only that morning the
little dog had followed Reginald and Katie half-way to school, the
bell on his new collar tinkling all the way.</p>

<p>That Reginald should have spelled the name
&ldquo;<i>Phido</i>&rdquo; made them laugh, but Arabella was not
contented with laughing; she fairly shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't care if you do laugh,&rdquo; he said, his
eyes blazing as he looked at her; &ldquo;you spell photo, just
<i>p-h-o,</i> and why can't Fido be spelt <i>P-h-i?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the room was again quiet Aunt Charlotte told Reginald and
Arabella to remain for a few moments after school.</p>

<p>When the other pupils had gone, Aunt Charlotte turned toward the
two who still kept their seats, and very gently she told Arabella
how rude it was to laugh at another's error, and how equally rude
for Reginald to reply in so saucy a manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little girl should be a little lady,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and a small boy should surely be a little
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Reginald spoke.</p>

<p>Looking straight into Arabella's eyes, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I'm a gentleman, so I'll 'pol'gize; if I was just
a boy I <i>wouldn't,</i> though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella was fully equal to a reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm as much a lady as you are a gentleman, so I'll say I
oughtn't to have laughed, but I <i>won't</i> say I'm
sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was late afternoon, and Flossie, on the piazza, waved her
hand to her playmates as they ran down the walk to the gate.</p>

<p>They had played delightful games, they had talked of the fine
party which they would soon enjoy, they had guessed and guessed
what sort of party it was to be, and Dorothy, who knew all about
it, had laughed merrily because their countless guesses were
nowhere near right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish playmates didn't ever have to go home,&rdquo; said
Flossie, as she ran into the house.</p>

<p>There was no one in the hall save the baby, who sat in her
carriage. The maid had just brought her in from a long ride, and
had left her for a moment while she chatted with the butler and the
cook. Flossie loved the baby, and she ran to the carriage to kiss
the sunny little face that smiled at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you lovely, lovely baby,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;are
you glad to see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer the little one cooed sweetly, and snatched at
Flossie's curling hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mustn't pull so hard, baby,&rdquo; pleaded Flossie, and
just at that moment the maid returned, and rescued Flossie's
ringlets from the little dimpled hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You give her to me,&rdquo; said Flossie. &ldquo;I'll sit
on this rug and hold her. Uncle Harry said I could take this baby
any time I want to, and I want to now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maid waited for no urging. Here was a chance for a few more
moments of gossip. If Miss Flossie wished to take care of the baby,
why not permit her to? Her Uncle Harry had given his permission,
and as it was his baby, who could object?</p>

<p>For a few moments Flossie and the baby played upon the great
hall rug. The bright-colored ball which Flossie had taken from her
pocket was a pretty plaything, and the baby crowed with
delight.</p>

<p>The butler and the maids were in the butler's pantry at the rear
of the hall, but while their voices could be plainly heard. Flossie
noticed nothing which they said until the maid spoke of the
baby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ees well, the petite belle, but upon her cheek the,
what ees eet the doctaire did say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, Marie, 'tis a ould-fashioned rash, an' manny's the
toime Oive seen ut on a babby's face, an' whoile the docthor makes
a fuss about it, it's just nothin' at all, at all,&rdquo; responded
Bridget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm thinkin' it don't pay to let it go an' not have the
doctor see about it,&rdquo; growled the butler in a deep bass
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An' ain't they seein' about it wid all their eyes, the
ould docthor a-peekin' at the swate little thing t'rough his
goggles, an' puttin' a wee bit t'ermom'ter into her mouth what for
I do' 'no' unless 'tis ter foind out if it's near toime fer her ter
be a-talkin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's very ugly, le m'sieur doctaire; if he was fine to
behold it would be well. And what said he of the child? That at
home she could not remain? If they do away take her M'sieur Harry
will weep his fine eyes out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you little Frenchie!&rdquo; exclaimed the butler with
a jolly laugh, &ldquo;you get things mixed. If it's nothing but a
rash, as Bridget says, she'll stay here, but if it's measles she'll
be hurried off up-stairs, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An' be <i>quarantained</i>, Oim tould,&rdquo; interrupted
Bridget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Breejhay, what <i>ees</i> that?&rdquo; cried the
little French maid, and Flossie waited to hear no more.</p>

<p><i>Quarantined!</i> Oh, what a big word, and what <i>did</i> it
mean? Who was going to do <i>that</i> to dear Uncle Harry's
baby?</p>

<p><i>No</i> one! She would not let them!</p>

<p>Quickly she gathered the wee mite in her arms, wrapped the warm
little cloak around her, and walking softly to the door, slipped
out, the baby nestled close in her arms.</p>

<p>Across the lawn she trudged, past the summer-house, and on to
the little clump of trees and shrubs which the children called the
grove.</p>

<p>In a little nook between the tall hedge and the shrubbery she
sat down, and took the baby on her lap. Fortunately it had no idea
of crying; she loved Flossie, and she cooed contentedly.</p>

<p>And now the shadows were long, and the light breeze, growing
stronger, swept in little chilly gusts across the treetops, and
searching lower, tossed the small shrubs as if trying to discover
Flossie's hiding-place.</p>

<p>She drew the baby's cloak closer around it, and bending lower,
kissed it, and whispered lovingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're all safe with me, for I won't let that old doctor
<i>quantine</i> you. You're Uncle Harry's own baby, and I won't let
anybody hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapVII">VII</a></h3>

<h4>PATRICIA'S PROMISE</h4>

<p class="chapone">At the Barnet house all was excitement. Servants
were rushing this way and that, searching for Flossie and the
baby.</p>

<p>Again and again the maid insisted that she had left them in the
hall but a few moments, and the cook and the butler declared that
she had spoken truly, yet it seemed strange that in so short a time
the two could have so completely disappeared.</p>

<p>In the midst of the excitement Uncle Harry came home, and he
looked very grave when he learned the cause of their alarm.</p>

<p>Yes, the house and grounds had been thoroughly searched, they
told him, and neither could be found, nor could any one remember
having seen them after the baby had been brought in from her
ride.</p>

<p>And while the other members of the household were searching in
every direction, Uncle Harry secured a lantern, and went out into
the shadowy garden, hoping that he might, in some forgotten corner,
find the two children whom he so dearly loved.</p>

<p>Around the house, along the driveway toward the stable, down a
little path to where the tall dahlias nodded; across the lawn to
the open space where the new moon spread its sheen, then toward the
shrubbery and the hedge.</p>

<p>Flossie saw the gleam of the bright lantern through the bushes,
and huddled closer to the little shrubs. She believed that it was
the butler who carried the lantern, and that he had been sent to
capture the baby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!&rdquo; she whispered,
patting its shoulder gently.</p>

<p>It had no idea of crying, but she was so afraid that it might,
and thus tell where they were hiding. It happened that the baby was
sleepy, and snug and warm in Flossie's loving arms, it was quite
content.</p>

<p>Nearer, and yet nearer came the light! Now it was going farther
from her,&mdash;now returning, and now, oh, she must hold her
breath!</p>

<p>A firm step trampled the underbrush, the lantern was swung high,
and the two runaways were discovered. With a sob Flossie clasped
the infant closer, hiding its face with her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sha'n't have this baby!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;for
I won't let you! Nobody shall touch my Uncle Harry's baby; nobody's
going to <i>quantine</i> her. I'm 'fraid out here, but I'll stay to
take care of his own baby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flossie! Flossie, little girl, who has frightened you?
Why are you hiding out here with the baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; she cried, holding the baby closer,
&ldquo;they've sent you to find us, but you don't know that they're
going to <i>quantine</i> this baby, but I'll never let them do
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flossie, Flossie, you're frightened, listen to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put the lantern down, and seating himself upon the grass,
placed his strong arm around Flossie, drawing the two closer as if
to protect them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They <i>are</i> going to <i>quantine</i> this
baby!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and they sha'n't cut her head off
'cause there's spots on her face. She's your baby, and oh, I
<i>love</i> you both!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wild note in her voice showed how genuine was her
terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody shall harm baby, I promise you that, dear,&rdquo;
said Uncle Harry, an odd quiver in his voice, &ldquo;and you were a
dear little girl to take care of her for me, but now I must take
you both up to the house, for every one is hunting for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Bridget said they'd have to
quantine,&rdquo;&mdash;sobbed Flossie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bridget was mistaken,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and besides,
no one is harmed by being quarantined. I'll tell you all about that
at another time. You are about chilled through, and as you're not
very huge, I guess I'll carry you both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no help for it, so Flossie laid her head upon his
shoulder, the baby, sound asleep, still in her arms, and Uncle
Harry strode across the lawn, up to the piazza, and into the hall,
where a frightened group were talking.</p>

<p>They crowded around him to learn where he had found them, but he
raised his hand to stop the eager questioning.</p>

<p>Flossie had been badly frightened, and he felt that she must not
be excited.</p>

<p>Once in her own little room with her mother bending over her,
she listened eagerly while Uncle Harry explained what the maids had
meant, and she sighed happily when she at last realized that the
baby was safe from harm, and that she would remain right under the
roof of their beautiful home.</p>

<p>When on the following day the old doctor called to see the baby,
he laughed heartily at the story of Flossie's fear, and he declared
that Flossie must have done a very fine thing for the baby. Its
little pink cheeks were fair, and the tiny spots which had so
frightened its young mother had been chased away, so the doctor
said, by its long stay out in the evening air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I <i>did</i> do something nice for that baby,&rdquo;
said Flossie, to which Uncle Harry responded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were a brave little niece, Flossie,&rdquo; and
Flossie was happy.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak">
<p>When the postman called on the morning of the next day, he
brought an invitation for the long-dreamed-of party.</p>

<p>Then the secret was out as to what kind of party it was to
be.</p>

<p>A fancy dress party! A costume carnival!</p>

<p>Of course the first question that each little friend asked of
the other was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to wear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, our prettiest party dresses, of course,&rdquo; said
Mollie Merton.</p>

<p>Mollie, who was always very positive, was greatly surprised when
Dorothy overtook them on the way to school, and explained that each
little guest was expected to appear in a costume which should
represent some well-known character in history or story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mamma says we are not to tell each other what we're
going to be,&rdquo; said Dorothy; &ldquo;we're to wear long
dominoes over our frocks, and we'll dance and play games, just
peeping through eyeholes to see where we're going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And nobody'll know who anybody is,&rdquo; chimed in
Nancy, &ldquo;for Mrs. Dainty and Aunt Charlotte will receive, and
Dorothy will walk up to greet them, so neither of us will even know
who Dorothy is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What fun!&rdquo; cried Jeanette, and the little group
laughed gaily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any boys besides me invited?&rdquo; questioned
Reginald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, there are ever so many boys invited,&rdquo;
Dorothy said. &ldquo;My cousins Russell and Arthur are coming, and
three of papa's nephews will be here. I've never met them, but
they're coming for a little visit of a few days, and I'm to have my
party while they're here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you girls are going to wear those funny long cloaks,
of course they'll hide who you are, but you'll every one of you
know us fellows,&rdquo; said Reginald, who felt that the girls were
more favored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, we won't know you,&rdquo; laughed Dorothy,
&ldquo;for papa insists that you boys must wear dominoes,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for us, I say!&rdquo; shouted Reginald;
&ldquo;we'll have as much fun as you girls will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we've two weeks to wait,&rdquo; said Katie Dean,
&ldquo;and all that time we're not to tell what we're to
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor even the color of our dominoes,&rdquo; said
Jeanette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sha'n't tell what I'm to be,&rdquo; Reginald proudly
said, &ldquo;but some of you girls will just <i>have</i> to tell;
girls can't keep a secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can keep a secret, Reginald Dean,&rdquo; said Mollie,
to which Flossie chimed in:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed we can. I <i>can't</i> tell what I'm to be,
because I don't know; mamma hasn't told me, but I <i>do</i> know
what color I'm to wear, and I won't tell that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reginald liked to tease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody'll tell something, see 'f they don't!&rdquo; he
said, nodding and laughing.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak">
<p>It was now just a week from the day set for the party.</p>

<p>Arabella, hurrying along the avenue, tried to thrust her arms
into the sleeves of her jacket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O dear! I shouldn't think this jacket had any
armholes!&rdquo; she cried impatiently.</p>

<p>She had hurried out before Aunt Matilda could stop her, and she
was trying to get her jacket on without pausing to do so. At last
her arms were in her sleeves, and she looked ahead to see if any
one was in sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She'll be awful cross if I'm late,&rdquo; thought
Arabella, and she tried to run even faster.</p>

<p>There were two reasons for Arabella's haste. The first was that
she had promised to meet Patricia, and the second reason was that
it was Saturday morning, and if she remained at home Aunt Matilda
would be sure to find something for her to do. Of course Aunt
Matilda would ask where she had been, and why she had run out so
early, and oh, no end of questions!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It'll be by-'m-bye when Aunt Matilda questions me,&rdquo;
whispered Arabella, adding cheerfully: &ldquo;and by-'m-bye isn't
<i>now</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; called Patricia, &ldquo;you're some late,
but not <i>very</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I'm here as soon as you are,&rdquo; said
Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Patricia replied, &ldquo;but I
thought you'd be over to my house by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren't we 'most there?&rdquo; questioned Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost, and not quite,&rdquo; said Patricia, &ldquo;and
anyway I was going to stop at a store before I go over to my house.
Ma gave me some money and I'm going to spend it for candy. Have you
got any to spend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Matilda won't let me spend money; she has her views
about folks spending money, she says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't want her for <i>my</i> aunt,&rdquo; said
Patricia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she isn't your aunt,&rdquo; snapped Arabella, and
now they had reached the little candy store, and Patricia, grasping
Arabella's hand, walked boldly in.</p>

<p>Arabella was greatly impressed, and when Patricia asked her
which kind she would like to have, she managed to just whisper that
<i>any</i> kind would do.</p>

<p>At Arabella's home Aunt Matilda reigned supreme, and it was said
that no one, not even Mr. Corryville, dared spend any money, unless
Aunt Matilda approved, but that might not be true.</p>

<p>Arabella thought it very grand that Patricia had enough money to
buy whatever she wished, and her surprise increased when she chose
a half-pound of two different kinds, ordering the clerk to put them
in separate papers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can have that bundle, and I'll have this,&rdquo; said
Patricia, as they left the store, &ldquo;and now we'll go over to
my house, it's that one next to the school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella looked toward the house at which Patricia pointed. It
did not look at all like the homes of her other friends. Patricia
rang the bell, and they heard the lock slip, then they commenced to
mount the stairs. The building was four stories high, and Patricia
lived on the top floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We like the top floor because it's so airy,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>Arabella said nothing, but when they were seated cosily in the
corners of an old sofa, each with her package of candy, Arabella
was glad that she had come.</p>

<p>A few moments later Patricia's mother entered. She was showily
dressed, and her many pieces of jewelry made Arabella stare. She
did not know that those glittering rings and bangles were worth
very little money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Patricia, you know I don't like to have you buy so
much candy,&rdquo; whined Mrs. Lavine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven't <i>much</i> candy,&rdquo; replied Patricia,
&ldquo;that Arabella's got belongs to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella looked quickly at Patricia. Was not that a sort of fib?
Patricia had not <i>said</i> that Arabella had bought her package
of candy, but she had certainly intended her mother to think
so.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lavine took a book from the table, and sat down by the
window to read.</p>

<p>Soon Patricia became restless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's go out again,&rdquo; she said, and in a few moments
they were running down the stairs, and out into the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got a little more money, and we'll have some ice
cream,&rdquo; said Patricia.</p>

<p>Arabella wondered where she got her money, but dared not ask
her, and while she was thinking about it Patricia spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked you over to my house because I think I'd like you
for my best friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and because I've got
something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella stared at her through her glasses, but she said
nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're sort of old-fashioned,&rdquo; Patricia continued,
&ldquo;but I guess we can play together nicely, and you needn't be
provoked at what I said, for we're going to have a secret the very
first thing, and I'll tell it to you when we're having our ice
cream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They entered a tiny store which the sign stated was an
&ldquo;Ice Cream Parlor.&rdquo; There was room for but three little
tables, but Arabella thought it quite grand, for the wall-paper was
covered with gaudy flowers, and the ice cream was very pink.</p>

<p>They took tiny sips that the treat might last longer, and
Arabella watched Patricia, and waited to hear what she had to
tell.</p>

<p>At last Patricia lost patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you ask what the secret is?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you tell it if it's worth telling?&rdquo;
Arabella asked, coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>guess</i> it's worth telling,&rdquo; said Patricia.
&ldquo;Say, you'll be at Dorothy Dainty's party, won't
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I'll be there; my costume is 'most
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's it going to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, don't you remember we are not to tell any one what
we are to wear; not even the color of our dominoes?&rdquo; Arabella
asked in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we didn't promise not to tell,&rdquo; said
Patricia, &ldquo;and, anyway, I'm going to tell you. Ma has made me
a Spanish dress, all spangles, and red ribbons, and gold tinsel,
and my domino that will cover it for the first of the evening will
be bright yellow! I've told you, Arabella Corryville, because now
you'll know which I am, as soon as you see me, and you'll be just
mean if you don't tell me now what you're going to wear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dorothy wouldn't like to have us tell,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we needn't tell her we told, and what about
<i>me</i>? Here I've treated you to candy and ice cream, and told
you all about my costume. If you were half-nice, you'd think you
<i>ought</i> to tell me about yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia's voice sounded grieved, and Arabella wavered.</p>

<p>Ought she to tell? She knew she ought not, but Patricia urged
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I was going to say we could each wear a blue ribbon
on the third buttonhole of our dominoes, so we'd know each other
the minute we got there. And, say,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;have you ever been all over the stone house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in every room,&rdquo; said Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been in the observatory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>what?</i>&rdquo; asked Arabella.</p>

<p>Patricia was sure that she had made a mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The room where the flowers are?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the <i>conservatory</i>, you mean,&rdquo; Arabella
said, grandly. &ldquo;No, I haven't been in there, but I've seen
the flowers from the doorway, and they're lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they're twice as lovely when you're right in the
room with them. I <i>know</i>, because I've been in there!&rdquo;
said Patricia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>When?</i>&rdquo; queried Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last time I was there,&rdquo; Patricia replied,
&ldquo;and <i>now</i> I'll tell you something; there's something in
that room that I know about, and not another girl knows it but me.
I won't tell you what it is now, but at the party I'll do better
than <i>tell</i> you; I'll <i>show</i> you. We'll go out into the
hall when nobody is looking at us, and we'll go into the
what-you-call-it,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The conservatory,&rdquo; prompted Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The conservatory,&rdquo; repeated Patricia, &ldquo;and
then you'll see <i>what</i> you'll see! I <i>promise</i> to
surprise you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you tell if I tell you,&rdquo; said Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, '<i>ndeed</i>,&rdquo; Patricia agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Aunt Matilda said she wouldn't let me wear anything
<i>flighty</i>, so she's made me a dress like a Puritan, and my
domino is tan color.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella's curiosity forced her to tell all that Patricia longed
to know, because she was simply wild to visit the conservatory, and
find out what it was that Patricia could show.</p>

<p>With vows of secrecy they parted, Patricia walking slowly
homeward; Arabella running all the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Matilda'll say something, I guess, when she sees
me,&rdquo; she whispered as she ran, &ldquo;First thing she'll ask
where I've been, and oh, I never thought to take those horrid
pills! The bottle is in my pocket, and I've eaten candy and ice
cream! It's lucky she don't know <i>that</i>; if she did she'd say,
'I shouldn't wonder if that child had fits before morning!' She
don't know it, and p'r'aps I won't have the fits.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapVIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h3>

<h4>THE PARTY</h4>

<p class="chapone">Lights blazed from every window of the stone
house, the great garden was brilliantly lighted, even the twinkling
stars overhead seemed brighter than usual, as if they knew of the
party, and were laughing as they watched the little guests
arriving.</p>

<p>Lightly they stepped from their carriages, and flew up the steps
as if their feet had wings.</p>

<p>What was their surprise to see the manservant, at the door as
usual, to be sure, but in a fine old suit of livery that made him
look like an English serving-man of many, many years ago.</p>

<p>Yes, there was the maid in the hall in a cute Watteau costume, a
tiny lace cap on her head, and a kerchief over her flowered gown.
She presented her salver, and each little guest laid a card upon
it, with the name of the character which she represented. These
were merely to be kept as souvenirs, that later Dorothy might look
them over, and see what a variety of noted personages had called to
do her honor.</p>

<p>They were not to be announced, for while the names of the girls'
costumes would not tell <i>which</i> girl wore it, the characters
that the boys took would of course be male personages.</p>

<p>So the little guests tripped through the great hall, and into
the long drawing-room, where another surprise awaited them.</p>

<p>There stood handsome Mr. Dainty in royal robes, as a king, his
beautiful wife in velvet and ermine as his queen, and gentle Aunt
Charlotte as lady-in-waiting.</p>

<p>How quaint the little figures looked in their long, cloak-like
dominoes of red, blue, pink, green, white, lilac, and indeed every
known color and tint.</p>

<p>As they each extended a little hand, they peeped at host and
hostess through the eyeholes in their dominoes, and if they were
recognized, they did not know it.</p>

<p>Now and then a ripple of stifled laughter told how greatly they
enjoyed their disguise.</p>

<p>When all had been greeted, Mrs. Dainty raised her sceptre, and
when the little figures were all attention she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear little subjects, we are happy to have you with us,
and for a short time we wish you to wear the long dominoes which
keep us guessing who you are. And now we will listen to some music,
and while you listen you shall enjoy a wealth of royal
bonbons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a signal from the queen the little Watteau maid entered,
followed by five other maids in similar costumes, each bearing
trays of candies.</p>

<p>At the same moment sweet strains of music sounded through the
room, coming from behind a group of palms and flowering plants.</p>

<p>The bonbons were delicious, and the merry music set little feet
tapping beneath the long cloaks.</p>

<p>Two figures sat very close together. One wore a bright yellow
cloak, the other domino was a quiet tan color. They were Arabella
and Patricia, and while they sat eating their bonbons, they talked
softly, that no one might hear them. A little figure in a long red
cloak leaned against the wall, listening to the music, and at the
same time watching the two who talked together.</p>

<p>It was Reginald who watched them, and his eyes twinkled as he
whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just <i>know</i> that those two are girls, and they've
gone and told each other who they are. <i>I'd</i> like to know who
they are, too, and I guess I'll walk over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made his way across the room, and soon was standing just
behind them.</p>

<p>The musicians were playing a sprightly polka. A triangle marked
the measures, and Reginald's red shoe tapped the floor beneath his
long red cloak.</p>

<p>The two who sat upon the divan were talking in what they thought
to be a very low tone, but when suddenly the music ceased,
Patricia's voice could be plainly heard,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Arabella!&rdquo; she said, and then, surprised at
hearing her own voice, she said no more.</p>

<p>Reginald laughed softly, and Patricia turned to look at him, but
of course could not guess who the red-cloaked figure might be. Oh,
it was fun to be hiding behind the gay-colored dominoes! It was
almost like hide-and-seek.</p>

<p>And now the beautiful queen was speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will have a pretty march now,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;My king and I will lead, my lady-in-waiting will follow me,
while you, my merry subjects, shall form, two by two, and march to
grandest music. After the march, the dominoes shall be cast aside,
and then&mdash;&rdquo; she paused, then laughing gaily she
concluded, &ldquo;<i>then</i> I shall know who my guests
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trumpet's blare told all to be ready! The king and queen
came down from their red velvet throne, the stately lady-in-waiting
followed, and then the bright-hued figures, two by two, marched
like a moving rainbow after the tall figures who led.</p>

<p>Around the great drawing-room in graceful figures the gorgeous
little procession moved. How bright their colors appeared, the
light shimmering upon a pink cloak beside a blue one, a green cloak
walking with a yellow one, a scarlet one with a white, a buff one
with bright cherry-hued domino!</p>

<p>But the greatest excitement came when, after the march, the
colored cloaks were cast aside, and the laughing playmates were
revealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you guess who I was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know you were talking to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were the questions which they asked each other, and the
gracious king and queen looked down upon their merry courtiers, and
admired their brilliant costumes.</p>

<p>And what a variety there was! First of all, Dorothy, as an elf
in gauze and spangles, was a lovely sprite to look upon.</p>

<p>Near her stood Nancy, dressed as a shepherdess. Dorothy's
cousin, Russell Dalton, made a charming page, while his sister,
Aline, was a flower girl. Reginald strutted about in an early
Spanish costume, and he had chosen his own dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't look old enough for Ponce de Leon,&rdquo; he had
said, &ldquo;but I want a suit like the one he wears in the
painting that hangs in the hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wish had been granted, and he looked like a tiny cavalier
about to sally forth in search of fortune, or undiscovered
countries.</p>

<p>Mollie Merton made a pretty Red-riding-hood, while, as usual,
close beside her, stood Flossie Barnet as Little Bo-Peep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody'd know I'm Bo-peep, because I've this crook in my
hand,&rdquo; said Flossie, &ldquo;but look at Nina and Jeanette;
what are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We're Spring and Summer,&rdquo; Jeanette answered with a
laugh at Flossie's little puzzled face, &ldquo;I am a rose, and
she's a crocus,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and have you seen
Katie Dean yet? She's a lovely butterfly. There she is
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all turned to look at Katie as she came toward them. She
was indeed a dainty butterfly. Her frock of yellow gauze matched
her wings, which were edged with gold, and as she ran toward them,
she looked as if she might fly if she wished.</p>

<p>Arabella looked very demure as a little Puritan, and really,
Patricia's showy Spanish costume was becoming.</p>

<p>There were many more guests, and all were in beautiful costumes.
The room was alive with color, and when, later, they danced to
merry music, it seemed, indeed, a joyous carnival.</p>

<p>The games came next, and how they played! And of all the games
they found one very old one to be the most delightful. Some one
asked if they might play it, and thus it happened that the king
announced that the next would be &ldquo;A Journey to
Nubia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maids entered, and quickly placed two rows of chairs, back
to back, down the centre of the room, placing <i>one less</i> chair
than there were children.</p>

<p>When the music sounded they were to march around and around the
rows of chairs, but when the music should stop abruptly, they must
rush to get a seat. The one child who would be left standing must
pay a forfeit.</p>

<p>A stirring march was played, and the children walked around the
chairs, and every time that they came to the end of the line they
paused, believing that the music would cease, but the musicians
played on and on. The laughing children marched gaily, when, in the
middle of a lively strain, the music stopped, and they rushed for
seats.</p>

<p>It was Nancy who found no chair, and she knew that she must pay
a forfeit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she asked, and Russell, who liked
Nancy, asked if he might set the task for her.</p>

<p>He was given permission, and turning to her he said: &ldquo;I'll
ask something, Nancy, that I know you can do. I'll beg you to dance
for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you need not beg,&rdquo; Nancy said sweetly,
&ldquo;if they will play a waltz, I'll gladly dance for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Softly they played a bewitching melody, and Nancy, running out
to an open space, danced till those who watched her were wild with
delight. And when the dance was finished they crowded around her,
crying in wonder:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nancy, how can you do it so gracefully?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn't wonder if you only knew how long I studied,
and how many hours I practised,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn't dance like that if I practised for ten
years,&rdquo; said Russell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe he could,&rdquo; laughed his sister
Aline, &ldquo;his talent is surely not for dancing, for only the
other day he told me that at dancing-school, just as sure as he
tried not to step on his partner's toes, he always trod on his
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's just what I do,&rdquo; agreed Russell, joining in
the laughter that greeted Aline's words.</p>

<p>Again and again they marched around the double row of chairs,
and each time the one caught standing was made to pay a forfeit, to
the delight of all the others.</p>

<p>For the next game they clasped hands and formed a great ring.
Dorothy, in the centre, extended her arms as she sang this
verse:</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;As around you gaily dance,<br>
I must see if, just by chance,<br>
In your ring which has no end,<br>
You do hold my dearest friend.<br>
Yes, my truest friend I see,<br>
Nancy, dearest, come to me.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>Nancy ran into the circle, and the others, clasping hands,
danced around them singing gaily:</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;See the happy, merry two,<br>
One with brown eyes, one with blue,<br>
One is dark and one is fair,<br>
Which of us will join them there?&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>It was Nancy's turn now to choose a friend from the ring, and
she at once chose Flossie.</p>

<p>Flossie was the youngest of the little guests, and she was
delighted to be so soon chosen.</p>

<p>Unnoticed by the children, several new arrivals had entered the
room. They were a few of Mrs. Dainty's nearest neighbors who had
been invited to come in during the evening and see the
merrymaking.</p>

<p>As Flossie stood in the centre of the ring with Dorothy and
Nancy, she looked toward the playmates who circled around them, and
was about to choose Mollie, when she spied Uncle Harry, and she
laughed with delight. He was dressed as an English squire of an
early century. Quickly she whispered to Dorothy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I, oh, <i>may</i> I?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh, <i>do</i>,&rdquo; laughed Dorothy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I choose you, Uncle Harry,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;oh,
come quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never too dignified to have a bit of fun, and always ready to
please the children, he hurried forward and entered the ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if I'd lose a moment in joining three such charming
young ladies,&rdquo; he said, while the laughing children danced
yet faster around the merry four.</p>

<p>How handsome he looked as he stood among his little friends. A
brave, athletic young man he was, with a heart full of love for the
children, who returned his affection with interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Uncle Harry, it's your turn to sing,&rdquo; said
Flossie. &ldquo;Do you know the verse you ought to sing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe I do know the one which belongs in this
game, but I'll sing one of my own,&rdquo; he said with a laugh.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;You are so charming, all in a ring,<br>
Hardly I know of which siren to sing,<br>
Yet if I <i>must</i> choose, then it shall be<br>
Mollie, bright Mollie to come unto me.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>His was a fine voice, and he sang his improvised verse to the
music of one of his favorite songs, &ldquo;Beautiful
Dreamer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish you had to sing ever so many verses,&rdquo;
Jeanette said impulsively, and he bowed to her earnestly spoken
compliment.</p>

<p>They had paused for a moment to rest, and for a time their hands
were unclasped. Patricia thought that this was just her chance. She
touched Arabella's arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she whispered, and Arabella followed.</p>

<p>It happened that no one noticed that the two had left their
playmates, and soon they were flying around in a circle, singing
their verses, and choosing as before.</p>

<p>The conservatory was brightly lighted, and the perfume of the
flowers was rich and heavy. The fountain plashed in its shallow
basin, and it seemed like a glimpse of fairyland. Patricia looked
about to see if any one had followed them, but no one was near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now this is what I'm going to show you,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You see that one lovely fountain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, yes, Arabella saw that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there's <i>two</i> fountains, and <i>I</i> know
where the other one is. I'll let you try to find it first, and if
you can't find it, I'll show it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do <i>you</i> know where it is?&rdquo; questioned
Arabella.</p>

<p>Patricia looked very important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, because I <i>do</i> know,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Arabella looked into this corner, and peeped into that, and
between them they managed to tip over some small pots of valuable
plants, but the music and laughter in the drawing-room prevented
any sounds in the conservatory from being heard. At last Arabella
was disgusted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe there's two fountains,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I'll <i>show</i> you,&rdquo; said Patricia,
&ldquo;and I'll tell you how I know. Just see here,&rdquo; and she
pointed to the jet of water which flew high in air, letting fall a
veil of mist and spray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's where the butler turns the water on to set the
fountain playing. I was in here once when I saw him turn that
little thing round, and I saw the water fly right up in a
minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella watched Patricia closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where's the <i>other</i> fountain?&rdquo; she asked
impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you'll see in a second. Come over here,&rdquo;
Patricia said, laughing softly.</p>

<p class="illus"><a name="illus172" href="images/Illus172.jpg"
target="_blank"><img src="images/Illus172s.jpg" alt=
"'There! that's another fountain.'" width="339" height="423">
</a><br>
&ldquo;There! that's another fountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, pointing to a pipe that ran along
the floor beneath a shelf filled with flowering plants;
&ldquo;that's <i>another</i> fountain, and I should think they'd
have both playing when they have a party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's <i>not</i> a fountain!&rdquo; said Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I know, and so will you in a second, for
I'm going to set it going. See here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fizz-z-sss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cloud of steam filled the little conservatory, and the two
frightened girls screamed with terror, believing that nothing less
than an explosion had happened. The servants rushed in and quickly
turned off the steam, while Mrs. Dainty and Aunt Charlotte, who had
hastened to the rescue, tried to quiet the fear of the
mischief-makers.</p>

<p>Not a word was said of the beautiful plants which were now
completely ruined, and Mrs. Dainty's kindness made Patricia feel
ashamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; she whispered, and no one had ever
before heard her say that.</p>

<p>Arabella was fairly hysterical, laughing and crying at the same
time, but Aunt Charlotte at last succeeded in calming her, and when
the little banquet was announced, they joined the other children,
and were as happy as any of the merry party that marched out to the
great dining-room.</p>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapIX">CHAPTER IX</a></h3>

<h4>TWO SLEIGHRIDES</h4>

<p class="chapone">In the centre of the table was a huge round cake
encrusted with gorgeous frosting in the forms of beautiful flowers.
Around its sides were festoons of buds and blossoms, while here and
there a sugar butterfly was poised as if ready for flight.</p>

<p>There were flowers beside every plate, there were ices in
wonderful shapes, there were bonbons and nuts in abundance, while
great silver baskets were heaped with luscious fruits.</p>

<p>What a treat it was! How they laughed and talked as they enjoyed
the feast! How bright the lights, how sweet the scent of the lovely
flowers with which every room was decorated!</p>

<p>From the drawing-room the tender music floated in. Oh, it was
like a dream of fairyland!</p>

<p>Nina Earl watched Patricia closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you never saw a finer party than
<i>this</i>,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Patricia stared for a moment, then she said just what one might
have expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This <i>is</i> a lovely party, and I never saw a grander
one except one I went to when I was in N' York, where they had a
cake as big as this whole table, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the table to hold such a cake as that must have been
pretty big to get inside of any room!&rdquo; laughed Reginald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you didn't see it, so you can't know how grand it
looked,&rdquo; Patricia replied, and as that was quite true,
Reginald had nothing to say.</p>

<p>Lola Blessington sat beside Nancy, and many of the older guests
watched the two as they talked together, and thought how charming
they were, and how very unlike.</p>

<p>Lola's blue eyes were merry, and her sea-nymph's costume was
very becoming, while Nancy's fine dark eyes and graceful figure
never looked prettier than in her lovely shepherdess frock.</p>

<p>At Nancy's right sat Dorothy, and her beautiful little face
showed the joy that was in her heart. She was always happiest when
giving pleasure to others.</p>

<p>And when at last the feast had been enjoyed, more merry games
had been played, and tripping feet had danced to lively measures,
then the great hall clock hands pointed to the hour, and the guests
remembered that it was quite time to be thinking of home.</p>

<p>A surprise awaited the merrymakers, for when good-nights had
been said, and they stepped out into the crisp air, they shouted
with delight, for lo, while they had been in the warm,
flower-scented rooms, a snowstorm had been covering the steps, the
gardens, the avenue with a white velvet carpet!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Reginald, &ldquo;this is the first
snowstorm, and there'll be fun every day as long as it
lasts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Long icicles hung like diamond pendants from roof and balcony,
and still the snow-flakes like downy feathers were falling lazily,
as if they knew not whether to pause, or to continue to
descend.</p>

<p>And when the last carriage had rolled down the driveway Dorothy
turned, and clasping Nancy's hands, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there never was such a perfect party! We'll always
remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; said Nancy.</p>

<p>There were two thoughts, two pictures in her mind. She was
thinking of Dorothy's first party, when, as a little outcast, she
had climbed up into the branches of a tree which overhung the great
garden, that thus she might peep at the lovely children in their
beautiful frocks; now, as Dorothy's friend and playmate, she had
enjoyed this fancy dress party, in a costume as charming as that of
any guest.</p>

<p>She was happy now, and how dearly she loved Dorothy, how
grateful she was for her home and friends!</p>

<p>For days they talked of nothing but the party, and Aunt
Charlotte found it a little difficult to keep them from whispering
about it during school hours.</p>

<p>Three little guests who had intended to come, had, at the last
moment, been obliged to remain at home. They were Mr. Dainty's
nephews, and they had been much disappointed in losing a charming
visit in which a fine party was to have been included.</p>

<p>Patricia, with her usual lack of sweetness, told Arabella that
she did not believe that those three boys had ever <i>thought</i>
of coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, <i>we</i> were there, and we had a fine
time, but say,&mdash;there <i>weren't</i> two fountains after
all!&rdquo; said Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what a thing to say, when I showed you the second
one, only it didn't work right,&rdquo; Patricia replied. &ldquo;The
way I turned it made steam, so if I'd only just turned it the
<i>other</i> way it would have been water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know it would?&rdquo; Arabella asked in a
teasing voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know it <i>wouldn't?</i>&rdquo; Patricia
replied, and Arabella chose to make no reply.</p>

<p>After the little happening in the conservatory on the evening of
the party, Aunt Matilda spoke plainly to Arabella about her choice
of playmates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't approve of that Lavine girl,&rdquo; she had
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't know her,&rdquo; ventured Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't need to,&rdquo; was the curt reply. &ldquo;A girl
that can't go to a party without meddling with things, and getting
into mischief, is not the girl that I care to have you with, and
there's no reason why you should go to the other end of the town to
find a playmate; there are enough pleasant girls in your own
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda's words were true, but with Arabella's contrary
nature, the fact that her aunt did not approve of Patricia, made
her the most desirable of all her playmates.</p>

<p>She at once decided to spend the next Saturday with Patricia.
She did not dare to ask Patricia to call for her, because Aunt
Matilda, if exasperated, might send her home, and Patricia would
never overlook that. She had just decided to invite herself to
visit Patricia when something happened which delighted her.</p>

<p>It was after school, and they were talking of the coming
Saturday, and how it should be spent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've not seen you driving your pony for a long
time,&rdquo; said Katie Dean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going out with Romeo on Saturday,&rdquo; Dorothy
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's a lovely road where the great icicles hang from
the trees like fringe, and the groom says it's the finest road for
sleighing in Merrivale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia had not been to school, and had walked over to meet the
pupils of the little private class.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Nancy's going with you,&rdquo; Patricia
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she will,&rdquo; said Katie, &ldquo;don't you
just know that Dorothy wouldn't care for the ride if Nancy weren't
with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katie laughed as she said it, the others joining in the
merriment, for it was well known that while Dorothy cared very
truly for all her friends, Nancy was the dearest. Patricia knew how
handsome Romeo looked in his fine harness, and the trim little
sleigh with its soft fur robes made a nice setting for Dorothy and
Nancy as they spun over the glistening road. She determined to say
something which would impress all who listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll invite you to a sleighride with <i>me</i>,
Arabella,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>indeed</i>,&rdquo; said Arabella, &ldquo;what
time shall I be ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You be over at my house 'bout two, and we'll go as soon
as we want to,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Nina looked at Jeanette, and when Patricia had left them she
spoke the thought that was in her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't know Patricia Lavine had a horse and sleigh. Has
any one ever seen her driving?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't b'lieve she has,&rdquo; said Reginald.</p>

<p>Patricia had offended him that afternoon by calling him a
<i>little</i> boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn't say that,&rdquo; said Katie, who, being a
year older than her cousin Reginald, felt obliged to reprove him
when things that he said were just a little too naughty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just tell me, Katie Dean, do <i>you</i> b'lieve she
has?&rdquo; he asked, but Katie was talking to Mollie, and she
chose to let him think that she had not heard his question.</p>

<p>The day set for the two sleighrides was clear and crisp.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty and Aunt Charlotte were entertaining each other with
exchanging memories of Mrs. Dainty's school-days when with her
classmates she had been as popular as Dorothy now was, and Aunt
Charlotte had found it a task to keep them under good discipline
without quelling their high spirits.</p>

<p>The fire in the grate flamed higher and crackled merrily, and in
the glow the two ladies were enjoying tea, small cakes, and
bonbons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may go for a short sleighride, if you wish,&rdquo;
Mrs. Dainty said, &ldquo;if you and Nancy will dress very warmly
for the trip. Aunt Charlotte and I have decided to remain here
cosily by the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Romeo hasn't been out for days, and I don't mind the
cold. It'll be just gay out in the crisp air,&rdquo; Dorothy
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then surely you may go if it is to be so very gay,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Dainty, laughing, &ldquo;but remember what I said about
wearing warm wraps and furs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dorothy promised, and soon, with the groom riding behind them,
they were off over the road.</p>

<p>Romeo was as delighted as they, and sped along as if shod with
wings, his mane and tail floating gracefully as he almost flew
along.</p>

<p>Dorothy and Nancy, nestled in a white fur robe, felt only the
frosty touch of the sharp wind upon their cheeks, and they laughed
and talked as if it had been a summer day.</p>

<p>On the dry bushes by the roadside great flocks of tiny sparrows
hopped from twig to twig, chattering and twittering as they pecked
at the little dried berries. A great crow flew out from a bit of
woodland, making a noisy protest that any one should drive over the
quiet road, and thus disturb his musings.</p>

<p>The icicles were glittering in the sunlight, and the crust
sparkled as if powdered with diamond dust, while the rough bark of
the trees still held a coating of frost which the sunlight had not
been warm enough to melt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'll tell them how beautiful it looked when we get
home,&rdquo; said Dorothy, her eyes bright with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will take two of us to even <i>half</i> tell
it,&rdquo; laughed Nancy.</p>

<p>And while Dorothy and Nancy were gliding rapidly over the frosty
highway, Arabella was standing at Patricia's door, ringing the
bell, and wondering why no one replied. Then some one came around
the corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Ma's gone to spend the
afternoon with a friend, and I've just been out to see about our
sleigh, so nobody heard you ring. The sleigh'll be here in just a
minute; you come up with me and help me bring down some
shawls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without stopping to question, Arabella followed her up the three
flights of stairs, and such an array of shawls as Patricia brought
out!</p>

<p>&ldquo;These sofa cushions I'll throw downstairs, and we can
pick them up afterwards,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Over the baluster she flung cushion after cushion, until
Arabella's curiosity forced her to question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ever <i>are</i> you going to do with all those
cushions?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Patricia looked very wise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you'll see,&rdquo; she said, and when she had reached
the lower hall she peeped out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Arabella looked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that's an old <i>pung!</i>&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, who said it wasn't?&rdquo; Patricia replied
sharply; &ldquo;but it isn't an <i>old</i> one <i>now</i>, because
it has just been painted yellow. It's our grocer's, and the boy
that drives it is going to let us ride in it this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella hesitated. She knew that Aunt Matilda did not wish her
to be with Patricia at all, and she also felt that to ride in a
yellow pung, lettered, &ldquo;Fine Groceries, Butter, Cheese, and
Eggs,&rdquo; was surely not aristocratic, and yet, what <i>fun</i>
it would be!</p>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapX">CHAPTER X</a></h3>

<h4>THE PUNG RIDE</h4>

<p class="chapone">The grocer's boy had delivered all of his
parcels except two large paper bags which he had pushed over near
the dasher. Patricia began to bring out the cushions, and the boy
tossed them in upon the straw which lay upon the floor of the pung.
Then Patricia and Arabella climbed in, the boy cracked his whip,
the horse sprang forward with a surprising jolt, then settled down
to a comical amble.</p>

<p>How cold it was! Arabella had wondered at the number of shawls
which Patricia had taken. Now she was very glad to wrap two around
her, while Patricia wore the other two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;G'lang!&rdquo; shouted the boy, and again the horse gave
an amazing hop which sent the pung forward with a lurch, and rolled
the two girls over upon the straw. Patricia thought it a joke, but
Arabella, never very good-tempered, was actually angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O dear!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I think it's just horrid
to be shaken up so. Well, I don't think you're very nice to laugh
about it, Patricia. I wouldn't like to take any one out to a
sleighride, and have 'em banged around,&mdash;oh, o-o!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a &ldquo;thank-you-ma'am&rdquo; in the middle of the road
that caused Arabella's angry speech to end in a little shriek.</p>

<p>It was useless for Patricia to try to hide her merriment. She
could not help laughing. She rarely felt sorry for any one's
discomfort, and really Arabella did look funny.</p>

<p>In the shake-up, her hat had been pushed over to one side of her
head, but she did not know that, and her old-fashioned little face
looked smaller than usual, because of the two heavy shawls which
were crowded so high that she appeared to have no neck at all.
Small as her face was, it could show a great deal of rage, and as
she drew her shawls tighter around her, and glared at Patricia, she
looked odd enough to make any one laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look as if you'd like to spit like a cat,&rdquo;
laughed Patricia, and just at that moment the boy who was driving
turned to ask which way he should go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got ter take them bags over ter the big old house
what's painted the color er this pung, an' stands between a old
barn an' a carriage shed. Know where 'tis?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I don't,&rdquo; declared Patricia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wal, I was goin' ter say that I kin git there by two
different roads, an' I'd go the way ye'd like best ter go ef ye
knew which that was,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only know I want the ride, and this road is stupid and
poky. Go the way that has the most houses on it,&rdquo; Patricia
answered, and the boy turned into another avenue, and soon they
were passing houses enough, such as they were!</p>

<p>Small houses that were dingy, and held one family, and larger
ones that must have held three tribes at least, judging by the
number of washings which hung upon the dilapidated piazzas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;G'lang!&rdquo; shouted the boy, but the nag had heard
that too often to be impressed, and he only wagged one ear in
response, but took not a step quicker.</p>

<p>Arabella was cold and provoked that she had come. Patricia was
excited, and felt that she was having a frolic, and even Arabella's
glum face could not quiet her; indeed, the more she looked at her,
the more inclined was she to laugh.</p>

<p>Arabella felt aggrieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea of laughing at <i>me</i>,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;when I should think I might laugh at her for inviting me to
ride in a sleigh that is only a <i>pung!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then something happened which made Arabella forget that she was
provoked with Patricia, because she suddenly became so vexed with
some one else.</p>

<p>A short, stubby boy with a mass of hay-colored hair, ran out
from a yard that they were passing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! Look at the girlth a-havin' a ride out! Look at the
horthe! My, thee hith bonthe thtick out! Gueth they feed him on
thawdutht an' shavingth, don't they, Mandy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, look at 'em! Look at 'em! Them's some er the
<i>private</i> school; don't they look <i>grand</i> ridin' in Bill
Tillson's grocery wagin?&rdquo; shouted Mandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that horthe would jump if I fired a
thnowball?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't ye do it!&rdquo; shouted the driver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not, Chub!&rdquo; cried Mandy, thinking that
perhaps the fun had gone far enough.</p>

<p>The fact that he had been told not to made Chub long to do
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here's the place,&rdquo; said the driver, and, grasping
one of the bags, he jumped from the team and ran into the house
with the parcel. The reins lay loosely upon the horse's back.</p>

<p>Chub, who had kept pace with the team, now paused to choose the
most interesting bit of mischief. Should he make a grab at the
loose-lying reins, and by jerking them surprise the horse, or would
he be more frisky if the half-dozen snowballs which he had been
making were all hurled at him at once?</p>

<p>Before he could decide, the boy came out of the house, and
jumping into the pung, gathered up the reins, and attempted to turn
the team towards home. Chub thought if he were to have any fun, he
must get it quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Heighoh</i>! You Jumpin' Ginger!&rdquo; he shouted, at
the same time letting fly the six snowballs. The frightened nag
reared, and turning sharply about, tipped the pung, completely
emptying it of passengers and freight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That'th a <i>thpill!</i> Girlth an' <i>onionth!</i>
Girlth an' <i>onionth!</i>&rdquo; shouted Chub, but Mandy, who was
older, knew quite enough to be frightened, that is, frightened for
her own safety. If the little girls were hurt, would some one blame
her or Chub?</p>

<p>The driver had stopped the thoroughly terrified horse, the pung
was not injured, so he thought he might see if the children were
harmed.</p>

<p>Mandy had helped Arabella to her feet, and picked up her shawls,
which had fallen off. She was more frightened than hurt, but her
feelings were injured. Patricia, brushing the snow from her cloak,
spoke her thoughts very plainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chub's a perfectly horrid boy,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and we <i>might</i> have broken our necks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye <i>didn't</i>, though,&rdquo; said Mandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I shouldn't wonder if Ma had him put in the big
lock-up,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for scaring our horse, and tipping
us out on the road. We may get <i>reumonia</i> for being thrown
into the snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye can't 'rest Chub; he ain't nothin' but a big
baby,&rdquo; said Mandy, &ldquo;an' what's <i>reumonia</i>,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia would not reply. The driver helped them to pick up the
cushions, but the bag of onions, which he had forgotten to take to
the big house, he left where they lay in the road. They were too
widely scattered to be gathered up.</p>

<p>Chub found a huge one, and commenced to eat it as eagerly as if
it had been a luscious bit of fruit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thith ith <i>fine</i>,&rdquo; he said as he took a big
bite from the onion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Chub's a regular little pig,&rdquo; Patricia said,
as they rode off, but her words were not heard by Mandy or Chub,
for the youthful driver was shouting a loud warning to Chub to
throw no more snowballs for fear of a sound thrashing followed by
arrest, while Chub, afraid to throw the snowballs, hurled after the
pung the worst names that he could think of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That horthe ith thlow ath a old moolly cow! It'th an old
thlow-poke! What a thkinny nag! That horthe eath nothin' but
newthpaper and thtring!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Chub is just a horrid-looking child,&rdquo; said
Patricia, &ldquo;an' he's the Jimmy boy's brother, but nobody'd
ever think it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who's the Jimmy boy?&rdquo; Arabella asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, don't you know the boy that we see sometimes at
Dorothy Dainty's house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean the one that wears a cap with a gold band on it,
and a coat with brass buttons, and tries to walk like a man when
Mr. Dainty sends him out with parcels,&rdquo; explained
Patricia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; said Arabella, &ldquo;but <i>he's</i>
real <i>nice</i> looking, and Dorothy says her father thinks he's
smart. I shouldn't think he could be brother to that little pig or
that Mandy girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he is, and one thing Dorothy said one day I
couldn't understand. She said that one reason why her father was so
kind to Jimmy is because Jimmy helped to get Nancy Ferris home one
time when she was stolen from them. Did you ever hear 'bout that? I
don't see how just a boy could do that, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, Arabella did not see, nor had she heard the story, but she
had seen Jimmy, and she wondered that he belonged to such a family
as that which produced Mandy and Chub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye're 'most home,&rdquo; declared the driver, &ldquo;an'
soon's I've landed ye I'll hev ter scoot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you'll have to take Arabella home; she lives 'way
over the other side of the town,&rdquo; insisted Patricia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, he <i>won't!</i>&rdquo; said Arabella.
&ldquo;I'd rather walk all the way than have Aunt Matilda know that
I've been sleighing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how funny!&rdquo; and Patricia stared in
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's funnier now than it would be when Aunt Matilda found
it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Patricia asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Arabella, &ldquo;whenever I've been
out, and she thinks I've taken cold, she boils some old herb tea,
and makes me drink it hot, and I have to be bundled in blankets,
and she makes such a fuss that I wish I hadn't gone anywhere at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you'd better not tell her,&rdquo; Patricia
advised, to which Arabella replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just don't intend to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And while Dorothy and Nancy were standing before a blazing fire
in the sitting-room at the stone house, recounting the beauties of
the sky, the branches fringed with glittering icicles, the
squirrels that raced across the hard crust of snow, and indeed,
every lovely bit of road or forest which they had seen, Arabella,
shivering as she hurried along, saw the bright lights, and rushed
past the great gate, across the avenue and in at her own driveway.
She hoped that every one would be talking when she entered. She
intended to join in the conversation, and she thought if she could
manage to talk very, <i>very</i> fast, Aunt Matilda might not ask
where she had been. But she did.</p>

<p>Arabella had removed her hat and cloak, and trying very hard to
stop shivering, she pushed aside the porti&egrave;re, and stood in
the glow of the shaded lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Warmer weather to-morrow, the paper says, and I guess we
shall all be glad to have it,&rdquo; Aunt Matilda was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It w-would be f-fine to h-h-have it w-w-warmer,&rdquo;
said Arabella, her teeth chattering so that she thought every one
must hear them rattle.</p>

<p>Over her paper Aunt Matilda's bright eyes peered at the little
girl who shivered in spite of her effort to stand very still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been, Arabella? You're chilled through. I
say, where have you been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've just taken quite a long walk,&rdquo; Arabella
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you've taken a long walk as late as this in the
afternoon, you've come some distance. Have you been spending this
whole afternoon at that Lavine girl's house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No'm,&rdquo; said Arabella, &ldquo;I haven't been in her
house <i>any</i> of the afternoon; I've been
out-of-doors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda threw up her hands in amazement, as if a number of
hours in the open air ought to have actually killed Arabella,
whereas, she really was alive, but exceedingly chilly.</p>

<p>Then the very thing happened which Arabella had told Patricia
would happen.</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda had her old-fashioned notions regarding the care of
children, and Arabella was sent to bed, packed in blankets, after
having drank a pint bowl full of the worst-tasting herb tea which
Aunt Matilda had ever brewed.</p>

<p>She had thought that she might drink half of it, and then throw
the rest away, but as if guessing her intention, Aunt Matilda stood
close beside her to be sure that not a drop was wasted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's no use to make such an outrageous face,
Arabella,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;for the worse it tastes the
more good it's <i>sure</i> to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I'd 'most rather have a cold than take that
stuff,&rdquo; wailed Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's the time you don't have your choice,&rdquo; was
the dry reply.</p>

<p>And indeed she did not, for besides taking the despised herb
tea, she awoke the next morning with a heavy cold that kept her
away from school for the whole of the next week.</p>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapXI">CHAPTER XI</a></h3>

<h4>AN UNEXPECTED TRIP</h4>

<p class="chapone">The next Saturday proved to be warm and sunny,
and Mrs. Dainty had taken an early train for the city, intending to
spend the day in shopping.</p>

<p>It had been necessary that Dorothy should go with her, because
there was a new cloak to be &ldquo;tried on.&rdquo; Mrs. Dainty had
wished to have Mrs. Grayson with her, but both had thought that
Nancy would be lonely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were to spend the day in the stores, Nancy, I would
take you with me, because you always enjoy shopping,&rdquo; Aunt
Charlotte said, &ldquo;but I am to visit a friend who is ill, and
that would be very dull for you, and if you go with Dorothy, you
will think that the hours drag if you sit waiting while her cloak
is being fitted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I shall not mind being at home <i>this</i>
time,&rdquo; Nancy said, cheerfully; &ldquo;I shall play with
Flossie and Mollie all the forenoon,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the maid will serve your lunch at <i>my</i> house at
one,&rdquo; Dorothy said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I'll ask them both to come over to the cottage to
play with me this afternoon,&rdquo; Nancy continued, &ldquo;and
before we're done playing you'll return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the forenoon was quite as pleasant as she had thought it
would be. She had gone over to Mollie's, and found Flossie already
there, and they had played tag and hide-and-seek just as if it had
been a summer day. The sunlight was warm, the breeze soft and
sweet, and every bit of snow had vanished. It was like springtime,
and they played without ceasing until the hour for lunch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well come over to the cottage together this
afternoon,&rdquo; called Mollie, as Nancy hurried away towards the
stone house.</p>

<p>She knew that lunch was always served promptly as the hands upon
the dining-room clock pointed to the hour of one.</p>

<p>She was rather afraid of the burly butler, because he stood so
very erect, and never, <i>never</i> smiled even when the jokes told
at the table were very funny. But the maid's eyes often twinkled,
and Nancy hoped that it would be the maid who would serve her.</p>

<p>She was surprised to find that lunching alone in the great
dining-room was not very cheerful after all, and after a hasty
meal, she slipped from her chair, refusing to taste any more of the
dainties which the maid offered her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You've not had much lunch, Miss Nancy,&rdquo; the girl
said, &ldquo;you might take an orange, and eat it away from the
table if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy took the big orange, and after much coaxing, pushed it
into her pocket, and soon forgot that she had it. It was only
quarter-past one. She looked again at the clock. Yes, that was just
what it said; quarter-past one, and Mollie and Flossie were still
at lunch. She remembered that they rarely came out to play in the
afternoon before half-past two. She wondered where she would rather
spend the time. At the cottage she could play with the kitten, get
out the new game that Mrs. Dainty had given her, or read her newest
book, but Dorothy's books were up in the playroom of the stone
house, and she was always free to read them. No, she would not stay
indoors. She would go out and be ready to greet her playmates as
soon as she saw them running down the avenue.</p>

<p>She put on her cloak and hat, and walked slowly through the
hall, thus using up as much time as possible. The house stood high,
and from the doorway she could see the avenue. There was no one yet
in sight.</p>

<p>She strolled down the driveway, intending to wait at the great
gate for her playmates to appear.</p>

<p>The gates were wide open, and as Nancy looked out, some one
rushed past her. The plainly dressed young woman turned to look at
the little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nancy!&rdquo; she cried, and &ldquo;Why, Sue!&rdquo;
cried Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D'ye live in that el'gant place Nancy? Why, it looks like
er palace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Dainty lives there, and I'm there 'most all the time
playing with Dorothy. I live in that dear little stone cottage with
Aunt Charlotte,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;but Sue, how happened you
to be here? Aren't you working for the doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy, I come <i>purpose</i> ter see yer,&rdquo; said the
girl, bending to look into Nancy's face; &ldquo;I wondered if you'd
remember me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how <i>could</i> I forget you, Sue? It was you who
used to be kind to me when Uncle Steve was cross, and when I was
sick you sent my little note to Aunt Charlotte so that she and Mrs.
Dainty came for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I done what I could for yer, Nancy, an' now I've come ter
ax yer ter do somethin' that I'm 'fraid ye won't want ter
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eagerly Nancy looked up into Sue's honest face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd do <i>anything</i> for you, Sue, because you were
good to me when no one else was kind. You were working for Uncle
Steve, and you were as afraid of him as I was, but you helped me,
and you knew he'd be angry if he found it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye're a kind little thing; ye'd do it quick fer me, but
it ain't fer me I'm askin',&rdquo; Sue replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it for the doctor who helped me to get well? I'd do
something just as quick for him. Uncle Steve was going to
<i>make</i> me dance when I was sick, but the big doctor said I
shouldn't, and Uncle Steve didn't dare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke Nancy's clear brown eyes looked up into Sue's blue
ones, and Sue's cheek flushed. She looked down at the sidewalk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain't fer the doctor,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he's
gone ter Europe, but he's payin' my wages whilst he's gone, an' I'm
stayin' with a woman what I worked fer before. Nancy, it's yer aunt
I'm with, an' it's her that made me come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy started back in terror. With frightened eyes she stared a
moment at the girl, then turned to run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nancy, Nancy! Come here!&rdquo; cried Sue. &ldquo;Ye
don't understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy paused, but she did not take a step nearer.</p>

<p>Sue hastened towards her, and Nancy seemed about to run
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't run away, Nancy,&rdquo; pleaded the girl, &ldquo;I
know what ye think; ye think yer Uncle Steve's after yer, but ye
can be sure he ain't. Yer Uncle Steve's dead, an' I do'no's ye need
try ter be very sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy came back to where Sue was standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it <i>true?</i>&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honest an' true,&rdquo; said Sue, &ldquo;an' all yer aunt
wants me ter git yer fer is because she's sick, an' she wants ter
see yer. Oh, if yer could see her, Nancy, ye'd hate ter say
&lsquo;no.&rsquo; She keeps askin' fer yer all day, an' when I told
her I'd find yer, an' ask yer ter come an' jest let her look at
yer, she looked brighter'n she had fer days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I'm afraid to go to the city to see her,&rdquo; said
Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ain't in the city. She's in a town only a little ways
from here. Ye could go with me in just no time, an' ye'd do her so
much good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy asked the question in wonder. It seemed strange that her
aunt, who had never loved her, should now long to see her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's got something she wants ter give yer, an' she's got
something she wants ter say, an' she says she can't rest till she
sees ye. It's her worryin' that won't let her git well. Ef she
could see ye fer a little talk, an' tell ye what she wants ter
tell, I guess she'd git well right off. Seems ef ye'd <i>ought</i>
ter come with me, ef it'll do so much good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy's eyes were full of tears, and her sensitive lips
quivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I <i>wish</i> I knew what to do!&rdquo; she cried,
clasping her hands together very tightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, ask 'em ter let ye go,&rdquo; said Sue;
&ldquo;they'd let ye ef they knew yer Uncle Steve wasn't there, an'
yer aunt was jest pinin' ter see yer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm '<i>most</i> sure they would if they <i>knew</i>, but
everybody's away. If only Aunt Charlotte or Mrs. Dainty were here,
I'd ask them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can't ye write a note, an' leave it at the cottage where
yer Aunt Charlotte'll find it as soon's she gits home? Ye kin tell
her I took yer ter yer aunt what's sick, an' ef ye tell her 'bout
yer Uncle Steve, she won't worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An' I hate ter hurry yer,&rdquo; Sue urged, &ldquo;but
I'll <i>hev</i> ter be gittin' back ter yer aunt, so I must go with
yer, er else leave ye here, an' tell her I couldn't coax ye ter
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't tell her <i>that</i>. If she's wanting so much
to see me, I guess I <i>ought</i> to go,&rdquo; Nancy said, but her
voice trembled. Even although Sue had assured her that Uncle Steve
was not living, the old fear of <i>any</i> member of his family
made her hesitate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm so glad ter see ye agin, Nancy,&rdquo; coaxed Sue,
&ldquo;an' ye'd ought ter feel reel safe with <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll go,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;if you'll
<i>promise</i> to <i>bring</i> me <i>back!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="illus"><a name="illus219" href="images/Illus219.jpg"
target="_blank"><img src="images/Illus219s.jpg" alt=
"'I'll go if you'll promise to bring me back.'" width="332" height=
"419"></a><br>
&ldquo;I'll go if you'll promise to bring me back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I will,&rdquo; said Sue, and after a
moment's hesitating, Nancy ran over to the cottage, wrote a hasty
note, which she left upon the table, and then, with her heart
beating fast, and her lashes still wet with tears, she walked
swiftly down the avenue with Sue.</p>

<p>Sue was delighted to be with Nancy again, and she had no idea
that she was doing anything which could possibly cause Nancy's
friends any uneasiness.</p>

<p>She had intended to call at the house, and ask permission to
take Nancy to her aunt.</p>

<p>Having met Nancy at the gate, she had learned that there was no
one at home, but she had urged Nancy to leave a note at the cottage
telling where she had gone, and with whom, and she felt that that
made the whole affair open and honest. Nancy's loving little heart
was less light. She thought that it must be right to go with Sue,
and if her aunt was so <i>very</i> sick, why surely she ought not
to delay going to her, but if only dear Aunt Charlotte had been at
home she could have <i>asked</i> her; could have just asked
her.</p>

<p>Sue talked all the way, but Nancy said little, and when they had
nearly reached the depot she looked back, and as she looked,
wondered if, even then, she ought to run back to the cottage. Then
the thought of her aunt calling constantly for her caused her once
more to think that it must be right for her to go.</p>

<p>There were not many minutes in which to think about it, for when
Sue had bought their tickets, the whistle of a locomotive was heard
coming around a bend of the road, and almost before Nancy knew it
they were seated in the car, and spinning over the rails towards
the little town where her aunt was now living.</p>

<p>It was all like a dream. She saw the tall trees, the broad
fields now brown, yet bare of snow, because the warm sun had melted
it, the church spires of other villages standing out clearly
against the blue sky, but they blurred and became indistinct,
because she could not keep back the tears. She was not really
crying, but as fast as the tears were forced back, others would
come, and she turned from the window to hear what Sue was
saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say it's only three stations more, an' then we'll be
there, an' when ye see how much good it'll do yer aunt, ye'll be
glad ye come,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Nancy's eyes brightened. If it was to do so much good, then she
had done right. It must be that she really ought to be on her way
towards the little house, and Sue had promised to return with
her.</p>

<p>And now the train, which had been flying along, slackened its
speed, and a frowzy-haired brakeman thrust his head into the car
doorway, shouting something, Nancy could not tell what.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said Sue, as she rose to her
feet.</p>

<p>Nancy slipped from the seat, and together they left the car and
stepped out upon the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't ask ye ef ye wanted ter bring anything with
yer?&rdquo; said Sue. &ldquo;Ye could hev packed a little bag with
anything ye'd want while ye was here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what should I want to bring in a bag?&rdquo; Nancy
asked in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't know but you'd want a apron, a night-gown, or
something,&rdquo; Sue replied.</p>

<p>Nancy stood still in the middle of the road, and stared at
Sue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <i>night-dress!</i> Why, aren't you coming back with me
to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nancy, don't stop there. I thought I told ye that
yer aunt wanted yer ter visit her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said she wanted to look at me, and that she had
something to give me, and something to tell me, but that wouldn't
take long, and I ought to go home to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there's no train home ter-night, Nancy. This is a
little town, an' there's only two er three trains a day. Ye
<i>must</i> hev told in yer letter that ye was goin' ter
<i>visit</i> yer aunt, didn't yer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know whether I <i>said</i> visit or not, but
truly I didn't think you meant to stay over night,&rdquo; Nancy
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wal, I guess ye said so, an' here's the street. It's only
a lane, an' that little bit of a house where the cat sits on the
step is the one where yer aunt lives. It's kind er cosy, ain't
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy did not notice Sue's question. She was looking at the
little house, the tiny fruit-trees in the yard, and the white cat
that sat upon the upper step, washing its face in the sun.</p>

<p>The place looked very poor and small after the Dainty mansion
and the trim stone cottage. But small though it was, it looked far
better than the old house in the city where Steve Ferris had taken
her, when he had stolen her from her home and friends.</p>

<h3 class="chapbreak"><a name="chapXII">CHAPTER XII</a></h3>

<h4>THE NECKLACE</h4>

<p class="chapone">Nancy could not help making friends with the
white cat, and it purred with delight at being noticed. Sue slipped
a key into the lock, and opened the door. They entered the tiny
hall, and the white cat followed them, as they walked towards a
little room at the rear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Sue? Did ye see her? Did she come?&rdquo;
called a thin, tired voice.</p>

<p>Sue opened the door of the sitting-room and Nancy ran in, all
sympathy now for the aunt who was really ill.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferris lay upon an old carpet-covered lounge, and she
raised herself upon her elbow to look at Nancy as she stood before
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Set down on that little stool, Nancy,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;so I kin look at ye better. My! But ye look well an' strong
'side er what ye did when I last seen ye, whilst I've grown sick
an' tired. But seein' ye'll do me good, an' ter-morrer I'll talk
with ye. They's some things I <i>must</i> say, but I'll rest
ter-night, an' tell ye ter-morrer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy looked the fear that she felt, and Mrs. Ferris hastened to
reassure her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye're safe here, Nancy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There
ain't nobody here ter harm ye. Like 'nough Sue remembered ter tell
ye 'bout yer Uncle Steve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy nodded, and was about to speak when Mrs. Ferris
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want ter speak hard 'bout him now, an' I don't
hev ter. Ye was with us long 'nough ter know what yer Uncle Steve
was like, but I will tell ye one thing: we didn't hev no luck after
ye left us. Steve kept ye dancin' at the theatre, an' they paid
well fer dancin', too. Then ye was sick, an' them two ladies come
an' took yer home. After that we went from one place ter another,
Steve workin' when he felt like it, an' not workin' when he
<i>didn't</i> feel like it, which was most er the time. Since he's
went, I've worked hard at sewin', an' with a few boarders I've
managed ter save 'nough ter buy this little house. It didn't cost
much. It's in a out-er-the-way place, an' they's only four rooms in
it, but ef I kin git well agin I'll earn 'nough ter git
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lay back against the pillow as if telling the story had
tired her.</p>

<p>The clock upon the little mantel ticked loudly, and the white
cat blinked at it a moment, then sprang up into Nancy's lap. She
clasped her arms around it, and bending, laid her cheek against its
head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferris opened her eyes, and lay watching Nancy, as she
caressed the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like ter see ye here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;an'
ter-morrer I'll tell ye why I sent fer ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kitchen door opened, and the scent of brewing tea came in
with Sue as she entered with a little tray which she placed upon a
chair near Mrs. Ferris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's yer tea an' toast,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;an' ye
kin help yerself while me an' Nancy has some in the
kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And while Nancy sat beside Sue, and tried very hard to like the
coarse food offered her, her friends at the great stone house found
it impossible to taste the tempting dishes which graced their
table.</p>

<p>Mr. Dainty was away from home on important business, and Mrs.
Dainty had asked Aunt Charlotte to come to the house with Nancy,
and stay with her until he should return.</p>

<p>So when Mrs. Dainty's shopping was finished, and Aunt Charlotte
had left the house of her friend, they had met at the station, and
had found seats in the first car of the train. Their carriage was
waiting for them when they arrived at Merrivale, and all the way up
the avenue Dorothy talked of the gift which she had bought for
Nancy, and of Nancy's delight when she should see it.</p>

<p>But no Nancy ran out to greet them, nor was she in sight when
they entered the hall.</p>

<p>In sudden terror Dorothy had thrown herself down into a
cushioned chair, and no words of comfort could stop her sobbing or
stay her hot tears. That Nancy was stolen, never to return, she
earnestly believed, and although Mrs. Dainty tried to quiet her,
and to assure her that her playmate would doubtless soon be found,
she only shook her head, and cried at the thought that her Nancy
was not with her.</p>

<p>The maid was sent to the cottage to see if any accident had
befallen her which kept her there, while the butler, in the
interest which he felt, forgot his dignity and begged permission to
call at the homes of her little friends to learn if she were
there.</p>

<p>He soon returned with the news that Mollie and Flossie had
played with her all the forenoon, and had promised to go over to
the cottage after lunch; that they did so, but they found no one to
play with, and after waiting for some time, they ran unable to
understand why Nancy had not been waiting to greet them.</p>

<p>Then the maid entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ye please, Mrs. Grayson, I found this paper on yer
table. I do'no' what it is, fer I'd not be readin' what wa'n't writ
ter me, but wonderin' if it was writ by Miss Nancy, I've brought it
ter ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dorothy sat with wide eyes and pale cheeks, her slender fingers
tightly clasping the arms of the chair. Could the note be from
Nancy? Would it tell where she was?</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty leaned over Aunt Charlotte's chair, and together
they read the hastily pencilled note.</p>

<p class="thoughtbreak">&ldquo;Dear Aunt Charlotte:&mdash;I guess
you remember Sue, I've forgotten what her other name is, but she's
the girl that worked for Uncle Steve, and was so good to me when I
was sick. She called to-day, and says my aunt is sick and thinks
she <i>must</i> see me, and you needn't think I'm stolen, because
Uncle Steve is dead, so he couldn't steal me again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My aunt doesn't live in the city. Sue meant to ask you if
I could go, but you were away, and she said I ought to go so I did.
I'll be right home as soon as my aunt has told me what Sue says
she's <i>got</i> to tell.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Lovingly,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: right; font-variant: small-caps;">
&ldquo;Nancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="thoughtbreak">&ldquo;The dear child has not told us
<i>where</i> her aunt lives, only that she is <i>not</i> in the
city. What are we to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte's face was pale as she asked the question, and
the hand which held the note shook so that the bit of paper rustled
like a leaf as it lay against her silk gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can do nothing to-night,&rdquo; Mrs. Dainty replied,
&ldquo;but to-morrow at daybreak the search must commence. I try to
find comfort in the fact that the girl, Sue, seemed to be honest,
and certainly she was straightforward if she intended to ask us if
she might take Nancy to her aunt, and to insist that she write a
note explaining her absence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure that the girl's intentions are honest, but I am
<i>not</i> so sure of the woman who sent her to get Nancy. Steve
Ferris is dead, but while it was he who once stole Nancy, it was
his wife who helped him to keep her. I am frightened, and I can not
believe that she has sent for her only for the pleasure of seeing
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty turned quickly to see if Dorothy had heard what Aunt
Charlotte had said, but Dorothy was questioning the maid to learn
when she had last seen Nancy. Aunt Charlotte's words, which surely
would have frightened her, had passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>It was late before any member of the household could think of
sleeping, and when at last Dorothy lay dreaming of Nancy, her long
lashes were wet with tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty had tried to comfort and cheer her by telling her
that <i>this</i> time they knew with whom Nancy was staying, and
that Sue, who had once before helped them to find her, would,
doubtless, bring her back.</p>

<p>Dorothy had listened patiently, but when Mrs. Dainty kissed her
and said &ldquo;good night,&rdquo; Dorothy threw her arms about her
neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mamma, I know we have Nancy's note,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and Sue <i>was</i> good to her once, but how do we know what
her aunt will do? What if she means to make her dance at a theatre,
just as her Uncle Steve did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mrs. Dainty could find no words with which to comfort her,
because her own heart was filled with that very thought which made
Dorothy so unhappy.</p>

<p>And when the bright sunlight streamed in through the windows of
the stone house it found every one wide awake and full of
excitement, eager to be doing something towards finding Nancy, but
in doubt as to what to do first.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Dainty's calmness that stilled their excitement, her
cool head that directed their efforts, her firm will which chose to
guide, rather than command.</p>

<p>And while every effort was being made to find Nancy, and to
learn if she were safe, Nancy lay upon an old bed in the little
house in the country lane, and slept soundly, after having cried
herself to sleep the night before.</p>

<p>She awoke with a start when a stray sunbeam came in through the
tiny window and touched her cheek.</p>

<p>For a moment she stared at the glint of light which danced upon
the wall, then a puzzled look came into her brown eyes, and she
rubbed them as if in that way she might better see, and understand
her strange surroundings.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she remembered all about it. Why she was in so
shabby a room, and why she was there at all. Ah, yes, Sue had
brought her, and she had thought that she should return that
night.</p>

<p>Now the morning had come, and with it the hope that before night
she would be again in her own home, and with those who were dear to
her.</p>

<p>She listened. There was not a sound of any one stirring, nor was
there any slight noises out-of-doors which told of busy people up
and about at early morning. She had forgotten that they were not on
a public highway. In the little lane there was continual quiet
whether at dawn or at high noon, so that one might have thought the
whole town asleep, or at least napping.</p>

<p>And shabby as the bed was upon which Nancy lay, it was far more
comfortable than the old lounge which Sue had chosen to occupy.</p>

<p>She had tried to honor Nancy as her guest, and so had given her
the best resting-place which the cottage afforded.</p>

<p>Nancy wondered if Sue were yet awake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sue!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; whispered Sue in reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't it time to get up now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Sue, &ldquo;fer Mis' Ferris don't
hev her breakfast till 'bout ten, an' it ain't pleasant ter wander
'round a cold house when there ain't no reason fer it, an' she
don't want wood burned fer a fire until I use it ter git breakfast
with. Ye might try ter git ter sleep agin; they's nothin' else ter
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One glance around the dingy chamber would have told any one that
much could be done before a ten-o'clock breakfast, but Mrs. Ferris
wished the house to be quiet during the early hours of the
morning.</p>

<p>And in spite of the fact that she was very wide awake, Nancy did
go to sleep.</p>

<p>At first she amused herself by staring at the odd-shaped scrolls
and blossoms upon the paper. There were blue and yellow flowers
with bright green leaves, supported upon latticework of a queer
shade of brown.</p>

<p>Nancy thought the vines looked as if they were crawling, and
that the yellow blossoms were shaped like huge bugs. The longer she
looked at it the more it seemed as if those vines did really move
upon the wall. While she watched them she dropped to sleep and
dreamed that she was trying to dance, but could not do the graceful
steps which she so well knew, because those vines had come down
from the wall, and were tangled about her feet.</p>

<p>When she again awoke the sun was shining brightly, and she could
hear the rattling of dishes down in the little kitchen.</p>

<p>She sprang up, and hurriedly dressed, wondering why Sue had not
called her. There was frost upon the window-pane, and she shivered.
Each garment which she put on seemed colder than the one
before.</p>

<p>She searched the room for a button-hook, and finding none, ran
down to the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought I wouldn't call ye till we got a bit warmed
up,&rdquo; said Sue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's that? No. I ain't seen no button-hook in this
place, but ye jest set on that chair an' I'll fasten yer boots fer
ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took a huge, crooked hair-pin from her hair, and buttoned
Nancy's boots with wonderful speed, when the tool which she worked
with was considered.</p>

<p>And what a breakfast that was, which Nancy ate from a blue-edged
pie-plate that was badly crackled.</p>

<p>A small piece of very tough ham, an egg fried for ten minutes,
until it looked and tasted like leather, a boiled potato the color
of lead, and a biscuit of about the same hue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't s'pose ye're used ter drinkin' tea, but I guess
I'll give ye some ter wash yer bread down. That biscuit's kinder
dry,&rdquo; and she offered Nancy a cup of drink, which, from its
flavor, might have been tea&mdash;or anything else.</p>

<p>The little kitchen was dingy, and the food not at all like the
appetizing fare which she usually enjoyed, but she was hungry, and
Sue felt flattered that Nancy ate the breakfast which she had
served.</p>

<p>And after breakfast how the hours dragged!</p>

<p>Nancy was anxious to be starting for home, yet she could do
nothing to hasten the time when she could go. Sue was busy with the
ordinary work of the morning, and Mrs. Ferris had told her to tell
Nancy that she would talk with her after dinner. That she felt too
ill to see her until afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Tain't no use ter fret, Nancy,&rdquo; said Sue,
&ldquo;she ain't good fer much till after dinner, but I guess shell
talk with ye then fast 'nough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I'm wild to get back to the cottage,&rdquo; wailed
Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye couldn't git there ter-day, fer this is Sunday, and we
don't hev but two trains that stop here Sundays. One leaves here at
half-past seven in the morning, an' the other stops here at
half-past nine at night, but that one goes ter the city, an' that
would be going right away from Merrivale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy made no reply, but turned to look from the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow will be Monday, and I <i>must</i> get back to
school,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when Mrs. Ferris called Nancy to
listen to what she had to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I kin talk ter ye now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;an' first
I'll ask ye ef ye remember the old house in Merrivale where ye used
ter live before Mis' Dainty give ye a home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I <i>do</i>,&rdquo; said Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wal, 'twa'n't much of er livin' ye had, an' the woman
what took keer of ye was only yer <i>stepmother</i>. Did ye know
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the children told me,&rdquo; Nancy replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wal, did any one ever tell ye 'bout yer <i>own</i>
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy stared in round-eyed surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, if she was my <i>stepmother</i>, of course I must
have had an own mother once, but I never thought of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was a beauty, an' ye'll look like her when ye're a
young lady. Her hair was dark an' curly, an' her figger was
graceful. Her big dark eyes was melting, an' she could dance, oh,
how she could dance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mamma danced?&rdquo; questioned Nancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She danced like a fairy. She was a stage dancer; there's
where ye got yer nimble toes, but she died when ye wasn't a year
old, an' yer father married that other woman who wa'n't nobody at
all. Yer own ma was called &lsquo;Ma'm'selle Nannette&rsquo; on the
play-bills, an' she was a good woman, a sweet woman as ever
lived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I'd known her,&rdquo; Nancy said, her eyes filled
with tears at the thought of the beautiful young mother whom she
had never known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An' one thing I sent fer yer fer was this,&rdquo; and
Mrs. Ferris took a small box from beneath her shawl. &ldquo;What's
in this box belonged ter yer own ma, an' how Steve got hold of it I
don't know. I found it 'mong his things, an' when I see yer ma's
name on to it, I knew he'd no right ter hev it. I took an' hid it,
an' Steve tore 'round like mad a-tellin' that he'd been robbed, but
he didn't say anything ter the perlice, 'cause he knew it didn't
b'long ter him in the first place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She opened the box and held up a slender gold necklace set with
tiny brilliants.</p>

<p class="illus"><a name="illus248" href="images/Illus248.jpg"
target="_blank"><img src="images/Illus248s.jpg" alt=
"Nancy clasped her hands together, and gasped, 'Oh!--O--O!'" width=
"337" height="423"></a><br>
Nancy clasped her hands together, and gasped,
&ldquo;Oh!&ndash;O&ndash;O!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy clasped her hands together, and gasped,
&ldquo;Oh-o-o,&rdquo; in admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's the name on the clasp,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Ferris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I found it I wondered why he hadn't sold it when he
was hard up, which was often 'nough, goodness knows, but after I
hid it, he said he'd kept holdin' on to it fer the time when he'd
need the money more, but I think he was <i>'fraid</i> ter sell it.
Knowin' 'twa'n't his'n, he thought he <i>might</i> git 'cused er
hevin' stolen it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy took the pretty necklace, and held it so that it sparkled
like dewdrops.</p>

<p>It was truly a charming bit of jewelry, not costly, but
tasteful, and just what one might think would have shone
resplendent upon the white throat of the beautiful Nannette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's yours by good rights,&rdquo; Mrs. Ferris said,
&ldquo;an' I ain't like Steve was; I don't want nothin' that don't
b'long ter me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I've given that ter ye, I feel some better. I've felt
like a thief ever since I found it, an' knew who it b'longed ter.
They's a note in the little box, an' when ye've puzzled over the
flourishes done in fancy ink, ye kin read that that necklace was
presented ter Ma'm'selle Nannette by, I forgot who, fer her
beautiful dancin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy looked as if she listened in a dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An' one thing more I want ter tell ye. I never approved
er Steve's stealin' ye. I told him 'twa'n't right, but he wouldn't
listen, an' I couldn't help ye. I was as 'fraid er him as ye was,
an' he was so headstrong, I had ter let him do as he wanted ter.
I'm tired now, and ye'd better run out ter the kitchen with Sue. I
know I'll feel better now I've freed my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy hurried to Sue to tell the wonderful story, and to show
the necklace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here's her name on the large flat side of the
clasp,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Sue's eyes sparkled with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I didn't like to ask her how soon I could go home,
just when she'd given the pretty thing to me, but, Sue,&rdquo; she
continued, &ldquo;don't you think she means <i>surely</i> to let me
go as early as to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do'no' what she means ter do, that is, not
<i>exactly</i>, but p'raps ye won't hev ter ask her. Maybe she'll
tell ye 'thout any teasin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those who would like to see Dorothy and her many friends again,
and to learn what became of Nancy, may meet them all again in
&ldquo;Dorothy Dainty in the Country.&rdquo;</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
