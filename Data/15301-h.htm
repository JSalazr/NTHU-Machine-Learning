  <p>Some time ago a friend suggested that a selection of the most
  interesting naval shipwrecks might be made from the official
  documents of the Admiralty, in illustration of the discipline and
  heroism displayed by British seamen under the most trying
  circumstances of danger: permission to search the records was
  accordingly asked, and most kindly granted by the Lords
  Commissioners of the Admiralty, and the present volume is the
  result.</p>

  <p>The Author is well aware that the task of preparing these
  materials for publication might have fallen into better hands;
  and whilst he gratefully acknowledges his obligations to the
  Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, for allowing him to have
  access to their Records, he desires also to express his most
  cordial thanks for the assistance he has received from those
  friends, who have kindly revised and improved his pages as they
  passed through the press. Without such aid, his own literary
  inexperience would have left the work more defective than it is.
  He is especially indebted to some naval friends for
  correcting<a name="Page_-28" id="Page_-28"></a> his errors in the
  use of nautical terms and descriptions.</p>

  <p>A list of all the shipwrecks that have occurred in the Royal
  Navy since the year 1793 has been appended to this volume, in the
  hope that it may be useful as a table of reference. The ships are
  classed, first, under the initial letter of their names; and
  secondly, they are arranged in chronological order as regards the
  time of their wreck.</p>

  <h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a><a name="Page_-27" id=
  "Page_-27"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

  <p>At the request of my son, the Author of this volume, I have
  undertaken to write the Preface, and to say a few words on the
  very peculiar and noble traits of character, which distinguish
  the British seaman on all trying occasions, and especially in the
  terrible hour of shipwreck.</p>

  <p>Many circumstances have combined to make me take a warm
  interest in all that concerns the navy. In early life, having
  passed several months in a line-of-battle ship during the war
  with France, I was an eye-witness of scenes and events, which
  called forth some of those qualities that are illustrated in the
  following pages. For the restoration of my health, in the year
  1811, I was advised to try the effects of sea air and a change of
  climate, and was glad to accept the opportunity offered me, by
  the captain of an eighty-gun ship, to take a cruise with him off
  the southern parts of the French coast.</p>

  <p>On one occasion, in a severe tempest in the Bay of Biscay, a
  flash of lightning struck the ship and set her on fire. The
  calmness with which orders were given and obeyed, and the
  rapidity with which the fire was extinguished, without the least
  hurry or confusion, made a deep impression on me. This was
  afterwards increased by the conduct of the crew in a severe gale
  of wind, <a name="Page_-26" id="Page_-26"></a>when it was
  necessary to navigate one of the narrow channels, by which the
  squadron that blockaded Rochelle and Rochfort was frequently
  endangered. The vessel had to pass between two rocks, so near
  that a biscuit could have been thrown from the deck on either. An
  old quarter-master was at the wheel; the captain stood by to con
  and to direct his steering. At one fearful crisis, every blast
  threatened to shiver a sail, or to carry away a spar, and a
  single false movement of the helmsman, or the slightest want of
  steadiness or of obedience on the part of any man on duty, would
  have been fatal to the life of every one on board.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span>As they drifted on their path<br /></span> <span>There
      was silence deep as death,<br /></span> <span>And the boldest
      held his breath<br /></span> <span class="i4">For a
      time.<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>When the danger was over, the captain thanked the officers and
  men for their conduct, and gave a snuff-box with five guineas in
  it to the quarter-master, in admiration of his steady head and
  iron nerves.</p>

  <p>I mention these incidents in my early experience as a sort of
  apology for a landsman's presumption, in venturing to write this
  Preface to a series of nautical details. In after years, the
  death of a dear brother, a lieutenant in the navy, who lost his
  life in a generous attempt to save a vessel from shipwreck on the
  coast of Sussex, moved me to a still deeper concern for those
  whose employment is 'in the great waters.'</p>

  <p>My early observation of the hazards of a sailor's career, and
  my brother's sudden call to his last account, in the awful perils
  of a storm at sea, taught me to reflect with <a name="Page_-25"
  id="Page_-25"></a>painful solemnity on the many thousand
  instances, in which our naval protectors are summoned in a
  moment, prepared or unprepared, to stand before the throne of the
  Eternal. Often have I asked myself and others, Can nothing be
  done to elevate the hopes, and to place the fortitude of these
  men on a firmer foundation than that of mere animal courage, or
  the instinct of discipline? The present is an opportunity of
  pleading for the sailor which I should be sorry to lose, and of
  suggesting something, which may establish his good conduct on a
  basis more durable, and more certain, than even the well-known
  courage and discipline of a British tar.</p>

  <p>I shall begin by noticing the extraordinary displays of
  self-possession, self-devotion, and endurance, which shed lustre
  on our naval service; and I will close my remarks with hints for
  the improvement of these noble qualities.</p>

  <p>The intrepidity and mental resources of a brave man are more
  discernible in the hour of patient suffering, than in that of
  daring action: and the contents of this volume form a record of
  heroic doings and endurances, which exhibits the British seaman
  as a true specimen of the national character. Duty is his
  watchword, and the leading principle by which he is governed.
  Nelson knew the spirits he had to deal with, when he hoisted the
  memorable signal, 'England expects every man to do his duty.' He
  was well aware that the men who could patiently and calmly face
  the toil and danger of a blockading fleet, day and night, on the
  stormy waves of the Bay of Biscay, or on the lee shores of the
  Mediterranean, such as his fleet had had to encounter, wanted no
  other stimulus, in the presence of the enemy, than <a name=
  "Page_-24" id="Page_-24"></a>that which he so confidently
  applied. Napoleon found to his cost, on the field of Waterloo,
  that the word <i>Glory</i> had no longer any power to launch his
  battalions successfully against troops, who had learnt in the
  British school of duty and obedience to confront death, not only
  in the impetuous battle-charge, but in the more trying season of
  long endurance in the Lines of Torres Vedras. Men who can wait,
  and bear and forbear, and remain steadily at their post under
  every provocation to leave it, are invincible opponents. The cool
  determination which resisted the onset, and withstood the furious
  rush of the French Guards, was part and parcel of the same
  character which made heroes of the comrades of Nelson. To obey
  implicitly, and to feel that no quality is superior to that of
  obedience,&mdash;to wait for your commander's word,&mdash;to keep
  order,&mdash;to preserve presence of mind,&mdash;to consider
  yourself one of many, who are to follow the same rule, and to act
  in unison with each other,&mdash;to regulate your movements
  according to the demands of the common safety,&mdash;to consider
  your honour to be as much at stake in submitting to a command to
  remain stationary and not to stir, as to dash
  forward,&mdash;these are the peculiarities, which constitute the
  substantial excellence of the national character; and the
  shipwrecks of the Royal Navy illustrate this national character
  even more than the battles of the Nile and of Trafalgar. The
  perils of a shipwreck are so much beyond those of a battle, that
  the loss of life, when the St. George, the Defence, and the Hero,
  were wrecked in the North Seas, in 1811, was far greater than
  that on the part of the English in any naval action of late
  years. In order to <a name="Page_-23" id="Page_-23"></a>place the
  qualities of obedience and endurance&mdash;so characteristic of
  the British seaman&mdash;in the strongest light, and to show by
  contrast that the possession of them is the greatest security in
  danger, whilst the want of them ensures destruction, I commend
  the following statement to the attention of all who shall read
  this volume.</p>

  <p>In the year 1816 two stately vessels were sailing on the
  ocean, in all the pride of perfect equipment and of glorious
  enterprise. The one was an English frigate, the Alceste, having
  on board our ambassador to China; the other was a French frigate,
  the Medusa, taking out the suite of a governor for one of the
  colonies of France on the coast of Africa. The importance of the
  mission on which each ship was despatched, and the value of the
  freight, would seem to assure us that the Alceste and the Medusa
  were officered and manned by the best crews that could be
  selected. Two nations, rivals in science and civilization, who
  had lately been contending for the empire of the world, and in
  the course of that contest had exhibited the most heroic examples
  of promptitude and courage, were nautically represented, we may
  suppose, by the elite who walked the decks of the Alceste and the
  Medusa. If any calamity should happen to either, it could not be
  attributed to a failure of that brilliant gallantry, which the
  English and French had equally displayed on the most trying
  occasions.</p>

  <p>But a calamity of the most fearful nature did befal both, out
  of which the Alceste's crew were delivered with life and honour
  untouched, when that of the Medusa sank under a catastrophe,
  which has become a proverb and a bye-word to mariners. Both ships
  were <a name="Page_-22" id="Page_-22"></a>wrecked. For an account
  of the good conduct, of the calm and resolute endurance, and of
  the admirable discipline to which, under Providence, the
  preservation of the crew of the Alceste is to be attributed, see
  pages <a href="#Page_204">204-226</a> of this volume. A total
  relaxation of discipline, an absence of all order, precaution,
  and presence of mind, and a contemptible disregard of everything
  and of everybody but self, in the hour of common danger, filled
  up the full measure of horrors poured out upon the guilty crew of
  the Medusa. She struck on a sand-bank under circumstances which
  admitted of the hope of saving all on board. The shore was at no
  great distance, and the weather was not so boisterous as to
  threaten the speedy destruction of the ship when the accident
  first happened.</p>

  <p>There were six boats of different dimensions available to take
  off a portion of the passengers and crew: there was time and
  there was opportunity for the construction of a raft to receive
  the remainder. But the scene of confusion began among officers
  and men at the crisis, when an ordinary exercise of forethought
  and composure would have been the preservation of all. Every man
  was left to shift for himself, and every man did shift for
  himself, in that selfish or bewildered manner which increased the
  general disaster. The captain was not among the last, but among
  the first to scramble into a boat; and the boats pushed off from
  the sides of the frigate, before they had taken in as many as
  each was capable of holding. Reproaches, recrimination, and
  scuffling took the place of order and of the word of command,
  both in the ship and in the boats, when tran<a name="Page_-21"
  id="Page_-21"></a>quillity and order were indispensable for the
  common safety.</p>

  <p>When the raft had received the miserable remnant, one hundred
  and fifty in number, for whom the boats had no room, or would
  make no room, it was found, when it was too late to correct the
  evil, that this last refuge of a despairing and disorderly
  multitude had been put together with so little care and skill,
  and was so ill provided with necessaries, that the planking was
  insecure; there was not space enough for protection from the
  waves, and charts, instruments, spars, sails, and stores were all
  deficient. A few casks of wine and some biscuits, enough for a
  single meal only, were all the provision made for their
  sustenance. The rush and scramble from the wreck had been
  accomplished with so little attention to discipline, that the
  raft had not a single naval officer to take charge of her. At
  first, the boats took the raft in tow, but in a short time,
  though the sea was calm and the coast was known to be within
  fifteen leagues, the boats cast off the tow-lines: and in not one
  of the six was there a sufficient sense of duty, or of humanity
  left, to induce the crew to remain by the floating
  planks&mdash;the forlorn hope of one hundred and fifty of their
  comrades and fellow-countrymen! Nay, it is related by the
  narrators of the wreck of the Medusa, that the atrocious cry
  resounded from one boat to another, '<i>Nous les
  abandonnons</i>!'&mdash;'we leave them to their
  fate,'&mdash;until one by one all the tow-lines were cast off.
  During the long interval of seventeen days, the raft struggled
  with the waves. A small pocket compass was the only guide of the
  unhappy men, who lost even this in one of <a name="Page_-20" id=
  "Page_-20"></a>the reckless quarrels, which ensued every hour for
  a better place on the raft or a morsel of biscuit. On the first
  night twelve men were jammed between the timbers, and died under
  the agonies of crushed and mangled limbs. On the second night
  more were drowned, and some were smothered by the pressure
  towards the centre of the raft. Common suffering, instead of
  softening, hardened the hearts of the survivors against each
  other. Some of them drank wine till they were in a frenzy of
  intoxication, and attempted to cut the ropes which kept the raft
  together. A general fight ensued, many were killed, and many were
  cast into the sea during the struggle; and thus perished from
  sixty to sixty-five. On the third day portions of the bodies of
  the dead were devoured by some of the survivors. On the fourth
  night another quarrel and another fight, with more bloodshed,
  broke out. On the fifth morning, thirty only out of the one
  hundred and fifty were alive. Two of these were flung to the
  waves for stealing wine: a boy died, and twenty-seven remained,
  not to comfort and to assist each other, but to hold a council of
  destruction, and to determine who should be victims for the
  preservation of the rest. At this hideous council twelve were
  pronounced too weak to outlive much more suffering, and that they
  might not needlessly consume any part of the remaining stock of
  provisions, such as it was, (flying fish mixed with human flesh.)
  these twelve helpless wretches were deliberately thrown into the
  sea. The <i>fifteen</i>, who thus provided for their own safety
  by the sacrifice of their weaker comrades, were rescued on the
  seventeenth day after the wreck by a brig, sent out in quest of
  the wreck of the <a name="Page_-19" id="Page_-19"></a>Medusa by
  the six boats, which reached the shore in safety, and which might
  have been the means of saving all on the raft, had not the crews
  been totally lost to every sentiment of generosity and humanity,
  when they cast off the tow-lines.</p>

  <p>In fact, from the very first of the calamity which befel the
  Medusa, discipline, presence of mind, and every generous feeling,
  were at an end: and the abandonment of the ship and of the raft,
  the terrible loss of Life, the cannibalism, the cruelty, the
  sufferings, and all the disgraceful and inhuman proceedings,
  which have branded the modern Medusa with a name of infamy worse
  than that of the Gorgon,&mdash;the monster after which she was
  called,&mdash;originated in the want of that order and prompt
  obedience, which the pages of this volume are intended to record,
  to the honour of British seamen.</p>

  <p>In the history of no less than forty shipwrecks narrated in
  this memorial of naval heroism,&mdash;of passive heroism, the
  most difficult to be exercised of all sorts of
  heroism,&mdash;there are very few instances of misconduct, and
  none resembling that on board the Medusa.</p>

  <p>This contrast is marked and stated, not in an invidious spirit
  towards the French, but because there is no example on record,
  which furnishes such a comparison between the safety which
  depends on cool and orderly behaviour in the season of peril, and
  the terrible catastrophe which is hastened and aggravated by want
  of firmness, and confusion.</p>

  <p>'It is impossible,' said a writer in the <i>Quarterly
  Review</i>, of October, 1817, 'not to be struck with the
  extraordinary difference of conduct in the officers and <a name=
  "Page_-18" id="Page_-18"></a>crew of the Medusa and the Alceste,
  wrecked nearly about the same time. In the one case, all the
  people were kept together in a perfect state of discipline and
  subordination, and brought safely home from the opposite side of
  the globe; in the other, every one seems to have been left to
  shift for himself, and the greater part perished in the horrible
  way we have seen.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
  "FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class=
  "fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <p>I have brought the comparison between the two wrecks again
  under notice to show, that as certainly as discipline and good
  order tend to insure safety on perilous occasions, so,
  inevitably, do confusion and want of discipline lead to
  destruction. In the one case, intrepidity and obedience prompted
  expedients and resources: in the other case, consternation was
  followed by despair, and despair aggravated the catastrophe with
  tenfold horrors.</p>

  <p>It is not to be concealed, that occasional instances of
  insubordination and pusillanimity have occurred in the British
  navy. Some such appear in this narrative, and they invariably
  have produced their own punishment, by leading always to
  disaster, and often to death; and they serve as beacons to point
  out the fatal consequences of misconduct, under circumstances
  either of drunkenness, disobedience, panic, selfishness, or
  confusion.</p>

  <p>The selfish cowardice, noticed in page <a href=
  "#Page_94">94</a>, on the part of the men in charge of the
  jolly-boat of the Athenienne, and of some of the crew of the
  launch of the Boreas, (see p. <a href="#Page_136">136</a>,) and
  the tumult, intoxication, and desertion <a name="Page_-17" id=
  "Page_-17"></a>of the majority of the crew of the Penelope, which
  were followed by the prolonged sufferings and painful deaths of
  the culprits, (see pp. <a href="#Page_200">200-204</a>,) are but
  a few dark spots in the shipwrecks of the Royal Navy, to set off
  by contrast the many bright pages, which describe innumerable
  traits of character that do honour to human nature.</p>

  <p>As a direction to some of these noble traits, every one of
  which will make the reader warm to the name of a British sailor:
  and, if he be one himself, will bring the blood from his heart to
  his face in a glow of emulation and honest pride,&mdash;I ask him
  to turn for examples of perfect discipline to pages <a href=
  "#Page_13">13</a>, <a href="#Page_23">23</a>, <a href=
  "#Page_62">63</a>, <a href="#Page_70">70</a>, <a href=
  "#Page_71">71</a>, <a href="#Page_75">75</a>, <a href=

  "#Page_278">278</a>, <a href="#Page_279">279</a>, <a href=
  "#Page_280">280</a>. Here he will behold the portraits of men on
  the brink of destruction, steady, 'as if they were moving from
  one ship to another in any of the Queen's ports,' and unmoved by
  images of death under the most appalling forms; and he will say,
  'Lo! these are triumphs of order and subordination, and examples
  of such resolute defiance of the terrors of the last enemy, when
  covered with the shadow of death, that no exploits in battle can
  exhibit fortitude that will compare with them.'</p>

  <p>For instances of generous thought for others, of self-devotion
  and of disregard of personal safety, I refer the reader to pages
  <a href="#Page_58">58</a>, <a href="#Page_59">59</a>, <a href=
  "#Page_67">67</a>, <a href="#Page_67">68</a>, <a href=

  <p>In the long list of heroes, which these references to examples
  of indomitable courage and unhesitating self-devotion will
  unfold, it is almost wrong to mark out one more than another for
  observation, and yet the following <a name="Page_-16" id=
  "Page_-16"></a>stand so prominently forward in the front rank of
  heroism, that it is impossible to refrain from noticing them.
  Captain Lydiard sacrificed his life in his desperate endeavour to
  rescue a boy from the wreck of the Anson, (pp. <a href=
  "#Page_128">128</a>, <a href="#Page_129">129</a>.) Captain
  Temple, of the Crescent, and more than two hundred of his crew,
  displayed a noble disregard of themselves, when they permitted
  the jolly-boat, their own last hope of escape, to take off as
  many as it would hold, and leave them to perish. There was no
  rushing, no struggling, to get away from the sinking ship, but
  with orderly care they helped the boat to push off, bade her God
  speed, and calmly waited their fate, (p. <a href=
  "#Page_153">153</a>.) The resolution of Captain Bertram, of the
  Persian, to brave the danger of taking some men off a raft into
  his over-crowded gig, was generously followed by the crews of the
  other boats, who threw their clothing and provisions overboard to
  make room for the additional weight, (p. <a href=
  "#Page_191">191</a>.)</p>

  <p>I may refer also to the magnanimous contest between Captain
  Baker, of the Drake, and his officers and men, each insisting on
  being the last to make his way from the ship to a rock (p.
  <a href="#Page_231">231</a>), and which ended in Captain Baker
  refusing to stir until he had seen every man clear of the wreck.
  A second struggle for precedency in glorious self-devotion took
  place, when the same commander declared, that all his crew should
  pass from the rock to the mainland, by help of a line, before he
  himself would consult his own safety, (p. <a href=
  "#Page_233">234</a>.) The rope broke, and the last means of
  communication between the rock and the shore was severed, while
  the captain of the Drake and three of his companions were waiting
  their <a name="Page_-15" id="Page_-15"></a>turn to escape. They
  met their fate with intrepid composure, (p. <a href=
  "#Page_235">235</a>.) Lieutenant Smith, of the Magpie, offered
  another memorable example, when his schooner was upset in a
  squall, and he took to his boat with seven men. The boat
  capsized, and while the struggling crew were endeavouring to
  right her, they were attacked by sharks. The lieutenant himself
  had both his legs bitten off; but when his body was convulsed
  with agony, his mind retained and exercised all its energies, and
  his last words were expressive of dying consideration for others.
  'Tell the admiral, if you survive,' said he, to a lad named
  Wilson, 'that my men have done their duty, and that no blame is
  attached to them. I have but one favour to ask, and that is, that
  he will promote Meldrum to be a gunner,' (p. <a href=
  "#Page_270">270</a>.) And richly did Meldrum deserve the
  distinction. When all in the boat had perished but himself and
  another, a brig hove in sight, but did not seem to notice the
  speck on the ocean. Meldrum sprang overboard, and swam towards
  the ship, and was thus the means of saving his companion's life
  as well as his own.</p>

  <p>In a volume like this, 'the dangers of the seas' come before
  the reader in such rapid succession, that he has scarcely time to
  think of the many other awful perils and sufferings, besides
  those of wind and storm, which put the mariner's fortitude to the
  test. The narratives in pages <a href="#Page_1">2</a>, <a href=
  "#Page_1">3</a>, <a href="#Page_9">9</a>, <a href=
  "#Page_36">36</a>, <a href="#Page_69">69</a>, <a href=
  "#Page_70">70</a>, <a href="#Page_113">113</a>, <a href=
  "#Page_115">115</a>, present to view the horrors of a ship on
  fire.</p>

  <p>In pages <a href="#Page_12">12</a>, <a href=
  "#Page_169">169</a>, <a href="#Page_171">171</a>, <a href=
  "#THE_PENELOPE">196</a>, <a href="#Page_226">226</a>, <a href=
  "#Page_242">242</a>, we learn something of the terrible
  consequences of being exposed to fogs and mist, ice and snow. In
  page <a href="#Page_27">27</a>, we have a vivid picture of a
  combination of these terrors; and in <a name="Page_-14" id=
  "Page_-14"></a>pages <a href="#Page_217">217</a>, <a href=
  "#Page_267">268</a>, the most appalling of all the dangers a
  sailor has to encounter is brought in view.</p>

  <p>We will hope that the rigours and perils of the blockade
  system, which occasioned so fearful a loss of life at different
  periods of the late war, but especially in the disastrous year
  1811, are at end for ever. From page <a href="#Page_154">154 to
  159</a>, and from <a href="#Page_168">168 to 186</a>, the
  accounts of the loss of life in the Baltic and North Seas alone
  occur in fearful succession; and the magnanimity with which
  hundreds, nay, thousands of our bravest officers and men met
  death on that most perilous of all services, has rendered the
  names of British blockading ships memorable in the annals of
  hardship, hardihood, and suffering. Many invaluable lives
  perished from the inclemency of the weather; men were frozen to
  death at their posts. It is recorded of one devoted officer,
  Lieutenant Topping, that rushing on deck in anxiety for his ship,
  without giving himself time to put on his clothes, 'in fifteen
  minutes he fell upon the deck a corpse, stricken by the piercing
  blast and driving snow,' (p. <a href="#Page_169">169</a>.)</p>

  <p>In page <a href="#Page_174">174</a>, we read of the bodies of
  the dead, victims to the cold and tempest, piled up by the
  survivors in rows one above another, on the deck of the St.
  George, to serve as a shelter against the violence of the waves
  and weather. 'In the fourth row lay the bodies of the Admiral and
  his friend Captain Guion;' and out of a crew of 750, seven only
  were saved.</p>

  <p>The Defence, the consort of the St. George, was cast away in
  the same storm: out of her complement of 600, six was the small
  remnant of survivors. This ship might probably have escaped, but
  her gallant captain (Atkins) <a name="Page_-13" id=
  "Page_-13"></a>said, 'I will never desert my admiral in the hour
  of danger and distress,' (p. <a href="#Page_175">175</a>.)</p>

  <p>An instance of obedience and discipline, worthy of particular
  mention, occurred before the St. George went down. A few men
  asked leave to attempt to reach the shore in the yawl. Permission
  was at first granted, but afterwards withdrawn, and the men
  returned to their posts without a murmur. 'As if Providence had
  rewarded their implicit obedience and reliance upon their
  officers,' says the narrative (p. <a href="#Page_173">173</a>),
  'two of these men were of the few (seven) that were saved.'</p>

  <p>The question now arises, to what are we to attribute the
  extraordinary display of cool determination manifested by British
  seamen, in such trials of nerve as are described in the following
  pages? The series of shipwrecks extends from 1793 to 1847, a
  period of fifty-four years; and tragic scenes are described, many
  of them far exceeding the imaginary terrors of fiction, and all
  of them equal in horror to anything that the Drama, Romance, or
  Poetry has attempted to delineate.</p>

  <p>We rise from the perusal with scarcely any other impression
  upon our minds than that of wonder and admiration, at the
  extraordinary self-command exercised when death was staring every
  man in the face. Doubtless there are some instances of
  misbehaviour, and of lack of firmness: it could not be otherwise.
  'When the stormy wind ariseth, and they are carried up to the
  heaven and down again to the deep, their soul melteth because of
  their trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken
  man, and are at their wit's end.' But such examples are so few in
  the British navy, that we have little on this score wherewith to
  reproach our seamen.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_-12" id="Page_-12"></a>To what, then, are we to
  attribute the manly bearing of British seamen, when the planks of
  their ship tremble under their feet, and the waves are yawning to
  swallow them up!</p>

  <p>First.&mdash;To the early training which almost all our youth
  receive, in one way or other. It begins at school. The first
  principles of generosity, as of obedience and order, are taught
  in our schools: whether in the national and parochial schools, or
  at Westminster, Eton, and Harrow, and other schools of a higher
  order, where in his very games the boy learns to exercise
  presence of mind, daring, and self-command. In our streets and
  play-grounds, where the humblest or the proudest are at their
  sports, the germ of the manly spirit is discernible in emulous
  contention as to who shall bear and forbear, remain at his post,
  give and take, with most patience and good-humour.</p>

  <p>Foreigners have allowed that there is nothing like an English
  school to discipline a lad for the high places, or rough places,
  of after-life; and that our mixed schools of every grade are the
  seminaries, where one learns to lead, and another to follow, in
  the path of honour and duty.</p>

  <p>Secondly.&mdash;To the habit which prevails so universally in
  this country, of giving place to those to whom deference is due,
  and of looking up to those, who are above us in station, with
  ungrudging respect and confidence. This goes with the man into
  all the walks of life. Some attribute it to the aristocratic
  feeling, which is said to be stronger in England than elsewhere:
  but it maybe more justly traced to that good sense, which is at
  work in all <a name="Page_-11" id="Page_-11"></a>orders of our
  people, and which understands when to obey and to hearken. In the
  seaman it displays itself in a predisposition to regard his
  officer as one worthy of his confidence, and whom it is his
  safety as well as duty to obey in the hour of danger. And this
  confidence is justified by the almost unfailing manner, in which
  the officer shows himself deserving of the trust reposed in him,
  and takes the lead in the very front of danger, and exhibits in
  moments of doubt and difficulty all the resources of a cool and
  collected mind, at the very juncture when life and death depend
  upon his composure.</p>

  <p>The leadership to which a British tar is accustomed, and which
  ever responds to his own confiding spirit, is one of the primary
  causes of his endurance and daring. His officer is the first to
  advance, the foremost to encounter, the last to hesitate, and the
  most willing to take more than his share of danger and of
  suffering; and this inspires the men with an emulation to do
  likewise.</p>

  <p>Conduct such as that displayed by the captains and officers of
  the Queen Charlotte (pp. <a href="#Page_37">37</a> and <a href=
  "#Page_41">41</a>), of the Hindostan (p. <a href=
  "#Page_71">71</a>), of the Athenienne (p. <a href=
  "#Page_96">96</a>), of the Anson (p. <a href=
  "#Page_128">128</a>), of the D&aelig;dalus (p. <a href=
  "#Page_189">189</a>), could not fail of producing a sort of
  instinctive effect upon a ship's crew. Under the command of
  officers who never flinch from their duty, who share their last
  biscuit with the lowest cabin-boy, and who will not move from the
  vessel when it is sinking under them, until every other man has
  taken his seat in the boat, or planted his foot on the raft that
  is to carry him from the wreck, where can be the quailing heart
  or the unready hand?</p>

  <p>Thirdly.&mdash;The blockading service has had much to do
  <a name="Page_-10" id="Page_-10"></a>in training our seamen for
  passive heroism and enduring fortitude. During the long war with
  France, it was a service wherein all those qualities were called
  into action, which are of most value in sudden emergencies.
  Vigilance, promptitude, patience, and endurance, were tried to
  the utmost in the course of those wintry months, and tempestuous
  seasons, when single ships, squadrons, and fleets were cruising
  off the enemy's coast, and every man on board was perpetually
  exposed to something that put his temper or his nerves to the
  test. Then was the time to learn when to keep a sharp look-out,
  to be on the alert in handling the gear of a vessel, to respond
  to the word of command at the instant, to do things at the right
  point of time, to hold life at a moment's purchase, and to stare
  death in the face without flinching. It was a hard and rigorous
  school; but if proficiency in readiness and fortitude was to be
  attained anywhere, it was in the blockading service, and there
  the heart of oak was tried, and the seaman was trained for the
  exercise of that discipline, of which this Record of Naval
  Shipwrecks presents so complete a picture.</p>

  <p>But we will hope that the principal cause, to which we may
  ascribe the good conduct of our sailors in the trying hour, when
  there seems to be a span only between life and death, is the
  religious feeling which they bring with them to their ship from
  their homes, whether from the cabin on the sea-shore, or the
  cottage on the hill-side. The scene described in page 115, and
  the anecdote of the poor boy, in whose hand was found an open
  Bible when his corpse was cast on shore, show the power of
  religious feeling in the soul of the sailor. It may be a very
  imperfect feeling, <a name="Page_-9" id="Page_-9"></a>but the
  sailor has it; and even in its imperfection it has a strong hold
  on his mind. From the first outbreak of the Revolution; the
  French sailor entered the service of his country as a volunteer
  or a conscript, embued with infidel notions: or to say the least,
  with the religious indifference which had become so common in
  France. Not so the English sailor. He was not one of the fools to
  say in his heart. 'There is no God!' It is not easy to define the
  nature of that awe which fills the mind of a religions mariner;
  but most certainly those 'who see the works of the Lord and his
  wonders in the deep,' face danger more steadily, under the solemn
  belief that there is a ruling power to control the waters, and to
  say to the winds, 'Peace! be still.' They are predisposed to 'cry
  unto the Lord in their trouble,' and to implore Him to 'make the
  storm a calm, so that the waves thereof may be still:' and this
  fear of God, which is before their eyes, has its influence in
  making them willing to adopt every expedient proposed to them by
  their officers for their common safety. Under this higher
  impulse, the spirit of obedience works in them more confidingly;
  and humbled before the Supreme Power, they are prepared to yield
  submission to every intellect superior to their own. Now if there
  be a feeling of this kind already at work for good in the minds
  of our seamen, it is of the utmost importance to strengthen
  it,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to give it a sure
  direction, <a name="Page_-8" id="Page_-8"></a>and to make it run
  in a deeper and a broader channel, by all the appliances of
  instruction and education.</p>

  <p>To the credit of the official Boards, under whose
  administrative authority provision is made for the religious and
  educational improvement of men and boys in the Navy, very much
  has been done lately to secure this great object. Within my own
  memory few seamen could read, still fewer could write, but now
  the majority of them can do both, and they respond largely to the
  instruction they receive, by their intelligence and good conduct.
  There is no more imposing sight than that of the crew of a
  man-of-war, when assembled for divine service; and if the
  chaplain be a clergyman, who applies himself zealously to his
  duties, he has a congregation before him, who show by their
  attentive looks, that they are under the power of religious
  impressions. Almost all ships commanded by post-captains have
  chaplains and naval instructors, and where there is no chaplain,
  the commanding officer is expected to read prayers on Sundays. In
  <a name="Page_-7" id="Page_-7"></a>port the crews of the Queen's
  ships have the opportunity of observing the sacred day, either on
  board the flag-ship, the ordinary, or in the dockyard chapel. I
  believe every ship in the navy is provided with a library; and
  first, second, third, fourth, and fifth-rates have schoolmasters.
  To men and boys desirous of entering the service, the preference
  is given to those who can read and write; and an admirable
  regulation has lately been adopted, which will contribute further
  to advance our navy in the intellectual scale. Boys are entered
  as naval apprentices, to the number of one hundred each, at
  Devonport, Portsmouth, Sheerness, and Cork. They remain for one
  year on board the flag-ship, under a systematic course of
  education, and are then drafted into sea-going ships. The happy
  effects produced by mental cultivation were felt in an especial
  degree, when the Discovery ships, under Captain, now Sir Edward
  Parry, were blocked up with ice, and had to pass so many dismal
  days and nights in the Polar Sea. A school was established both
  in the Hecla and Fury, under able superintendence; and men, whose
  time would have hung heavily during their icy imprisonment, were
  kept in good humour and cheerfulness by the intellectual
  occupations in which they were engaged. Captain Parry's remarks
  in attestation of the moral effect produced by this means, and on
  the uninterrupted good order which prevailed among his men, are
  cited in page <a href="#Page_243">243</a> of this work.</p>

  <p>It would add greatly to the intellectual and spiritual
  improvement of our seamen, if a Chaplain-general were appointed
  to take the oversight of the religious instruction, and an
  <i>Examiner</i> to direct the secular instruction, <a name=
  "Page_-6" id="Page_-6"></a>of the Navy. The former should
  exercise authority similar to that of an archdeacon, and the
  functions of the latter should resemble those of her Majesty's
  Inspectors of Schools. The impulse given to parochial education
  by the latter is beyond all calculation; and the difference of
  ecclesiastical discipline in a diocese, where there are active
  archdeacons and where there are not, is a matter of well
  ascertained fact.</p>

  <p>The duties of a chaplain-general<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id=
  "FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class=
  "fnanchor">[3]</a> should be to visit the naval posts, and to go
  on board the Queen's ships, (especially before they are
  despatched on foreign service,) for the purpose of reporting and
  advising. He should look out for and recommend competent
  chaplains,&mdash;consult with admirals and captains on the best
  mode of securing the regular performance of the sacred
  offices,&mdash;make inquiry into the state of the ship-libraries,
  keep them well supplied with religious books and tracts, and
  direct observation generally to the spiritual wants of <a name=
  "Page_-5" id="Page_-5"></a>ships and ports. He would thus be of
  infinite use in making religion an object of more and more
  thoughtfulness to those, who take an interest in the comfort and
  good conduct of the Navy: two things which always go
  together.</p>

  <p>If an Inspector of all the naval schools and schoolmasters
  were appointed (Professor Mosely has now the inspection of the
  Dockyard Schools,) he should consider it to be part of his office
  to look to the libraries, and to recommend elementary books. His
  periodical examinations would be likely to stir up the same
  spirit of emulation on board ship, which has been the result in
  our towns and villages, where the schools are visited by persons
  appointed by the Committee of Privy Council on Education. I am
  satisfied with throwing out these suggestions without dwelling
  further upon them, under the persuasion that every practical hint
  of the kind will be well considered, and acted upon (if it
  commend itself to their judgment,) by those who preside over
  naval affairs, and who have at heart the mental improvement of
  our seamen.</p>

  <p>I have another suggestion to make, which is meant not for
  those only, who are officially interested in the condition of the
  navy, but for all who love and value it. The merchant service,
  the fisheries, and the coasting trade are the nurseries of the
  navy. Every shipmate and every boatman on the sea and on the
  river ought, therefore, to come in for a share of our sympathy,
  because he belongs to a class to which the Queen's ships must
  look for a supply of men. But none are exposed to more trials
  than they, and especially in the larger <a name="Page_-4" id=
  "Page_-4"></a>ports. Many of them come home from a voyage of
  danger and deprivation, full of excitement, and become victims of
  plunder and temptation; and the man who last week was impressed,
  by the perils of the tempest, with the terrors of the Lord, and
  was inclined to fear God and to serve him, is waylaid by
  unfeeling wretches, who first entice him into scenes of
  profligacy and blasphemy, and then cast him off, robbed of his
  money, seared in his conscience, and in a miserable condition of
  soul and body. Many benevolent efforts have been made to protect
  and fortify some of those who are thus beset, and to reclaim such
  as are not utterly lost; and associations have been formed for
  the purpose of affording temporary relief and instruction to
  seamen, who might otherwise become outcasts, and perish in want
  and ignorance. I allude to such institutions as the 'Sailor's
  Home,' or 'Destitute Sailor's Asylum,' in London, for the
  reception of seamen who have squandered or have been despoiled of
  their earnings after their return from a foreign voyage, or who
  are disabled for employment by illness, age, or accident. There
  is also. 'The Floating Chapel,' opened to invite and enable
  mariners to avail themselves of the opportunity of attending
  Divine service, (under the Thames Church Missionary Society,)
  which moves from one thickly populated sailors' locality to
  another. The establishment of a district church and minister in a
  large sea-port parish, like that of St. Mary's, Devonport, to
  relieve the necessities of a district crowded with mariners, and
  rife with all the snares and temptations which entrap a <a name=
  "Page_-3" id="Page_-3"></a>sailor, and endanger his bodily and
  spiritual safety, is another undertaking worthy of notice.</p>

  <p>Institutions like these must depend principally on public and
  voluntary support. There is much need for them in all our
  principal sea-ports; for who require them more than the men who
  are perpetually exposed to the double shipwreck of body and soul?
  The members of these and similar institutions are instrumental in
  preserving some from ruin&mdash;in restoring others to character
  and employment, to usefulness, to self-estimation, and to
  religious feeling; and in making both our merchant and naval
  service an example to the world of subordination and patient
  endurance.</p>

  <p>The promoters of these institutions are not satisfied with
  providing a remedy for the evil which exists, but they do much to
  prevent the ills of irreligion and immorality, by supplying
  seamen with instructive and devotional books, and by employing
  agents to go among them and to tell them where the offices of
  religion are performed. The countenance which admirals and
  captains, prelates and lords of the Admiralty, have given to
  them, are the best warrant for their necessity and usefulness. A
  short notice of 'The Swan' and its Tender, will not be thought
  out of place in this volume.</p>

  <p>'The Swan' is a large cutter of about 140 tons. On her bows
  she bears an inscription which describes her as 'The Thames
  Church.' She conveys a clergyman and a floating sanctuary from
  one pool in the river to another, to carry the Word of God to
  those who do not seek for it themselves. Hers is a missionary
  voyage. She is <a name="Page_-2" id="Page_-2"></a>freighted with
  Bibles and Testaments and Prayer-books, and religious tracts. She
  runs alongside colliers, outward-bound vessels, and emigrant
  ships especially, that the services, the consolation, and the
  instruction of the Church may be offered as a parting gift to
  those, who are taking a last leave of their native shores, and
  are saying farewell to weeping friends and kindred.</p>

  <p>There is also a Tender, called 'The Little Thames Church,'
  which sails lower down the river, as occasion may require,
  fraught on the same holy errand. One extract from the last Report
  of the 'Thames Church Mission Society,' which is patronized by
  the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishops of London and
  Winchester, will suffice to explain the nature of her
  mission.</p>

  <p>'Sunday, February 24, Long Reach. Morning service. The
  congregation was 128 seamen. Afternoon, Bible class, 62. Evening
  service, 132,&mdash;total 322. One of the captains observed that
  there was a great change for the better, which he was rejoiced to
  see: 'For,' said he, 'about four years ago I attended a service,
  and found that I was the only sailor that had come from the
  fleet; but this morning so crowded was the church, that I had
  some difficulty in getting a seat.''</p>

  <p>It is by means such as these, which as a Christian nation we
  are bound to provide, that we might hope, not only to keep alive,
  but to improve the noble spirit which distinguishes the British
  Navy.</p>

  <p>The discipline which now prevails would be established on the
  highest principle of obedience and action. The endurance, which
  now bears suffering with fortitude, would learn to submit to
  severer trials under the sanction of a <a name="Page_-1" id=
  "Page_-1"></a>higher teaching, and patience would have her
  perfect work. The courage and steadiness of a brave crew would
  receive an accession of energy from the hope that is set before
  them. The allegiance, which they owe to their Sovereign, would be
  strengthened by a sense of the more sacred duty which they owe to
  Him, by whom kings reign and rulers govern: and committing
  themselves habitually to the protection of Providence, they would
  face deprivation, fatigue, and danger with unshaken
  composure.&mdash;with a hand for any toil, and a heart for any
  fate.</p>

      which religious awe has on the minds of
      seamen:&mdash;'Yesterday (Monday) afternoon, the united
      crews, amounting to about thirty men, had a free passage to
      Ipswich by the River Queen. The scene on board was of the
      most extraordinary and affecting description. The rough,
      weather-beaten seamen, who had gone through the perils of
      that night with undaunted courage, were, in the review of it,
      completely overwhelmed with gratitude to God for His mercy in
      granting them deliverance. For the most part they were in the
      fore cabin of the steamer, and at one time all would be on
      their knees in devout prayer and thanksgiving to God, then a
      suitable hymn would be read, and the voices of those who had
      been saved from the yawning ocean would presently sound it
      forth in solemn thanks to God. From port to port they were
      entirely occupied in these devotional exercises, and the
      effect of them, and indeed the whole scene, upon several
      hardy sons of ocean who were on board, will never be

      of the Church of England, and for such others as may require
      the services of a Church of England clergyman; and having
      assembled them together, inquire as to the occurrences on the

      or daily service, whether there are children to be baptized,
      and a thousand other matters of a like nature, which it would

  <p>In the Preface to this work it has been stated that it is not
  our intention to give a detailed account of every wreck that has
  happened in the Royal Navy from the year 1793, to the present
  time, but only of a few of those which appear to be most
  interesting. We therefore pass over the first two years, giving
  only a catalogue of the wrecks that occurred during that time;
  because the calamities that befel the British Navy in 1793 and
  1794 were but slight in comparison with those of a later date.
  The first loss that we have to record is that of the BOYNE, of 98
  guns, bearing the flag of Vice-Admiral Peyton, and commanded by
  Captain George Grey. This ship took fire as she lay at anchor at
  Spithead, on the 1st of May, 1795.</p>

  <p>The origin of the fire has never been correctly ascertained;
  but it is supposed that some of the lighted paper <a name=
  "Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>from the cartridges of the marines, as
  they were exercising and firing on the windward side of the poop,
  flew through the quarter gallery into the admiral's cabin, and
  set fire to the papers or other inflammable materials that were
  lying there. Be this as it may, the flames burst through the poop
  before the fire was discovered, and, notwithstanding the united
  efforts of both officers and men, they soon wrapt the vessel in a
  blaze fore and aft.</p>

  <p>Upon the discovery of the fire, all the boats from the
  different ships put out to the Boyne's assistance, and the crew,
  with the exception of eleven, were saved.</p>

  <p>The Boyne's guns, being loaded, went off as they became
  heated, and much injury would have been done to the shipping and
  those on board, had not the Port-Admiral, Sir William Parker,
  made signals for the vessels most in danger to get under weigh.
  As it was, two men were killed, and one wounded on board the
  Queen Charlotte.</p>

  <p>About half-past one in the afternoon, the burning ship parted
  from her cables, and blew up with a dreadful explosion. At the
  time of the accident, Admiral Peyton and Captain Grey were
  attending a court martial in Portsmouth Harbour.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="THE_AMPHION" id="THE_AMPHION"></a>THE AMPHION</h2>

  <p>The next catastrophe which we have to describe, was of a far
  more appalling nature, and one which long threw a gloom over the
  inhabitants of Plymouth and the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>The AMPHION frigate had been obliged to put into Plymouth for
  repairs, and, on the 22nd Sept., 1796, was lying alongside of a
  sheer-hulk taking in her bowsprit, within a few yards of the
  dockyard jetty. The ship, being on the eve of sailing, was
  crowded with more than an hundred men, women, and children, above
  her usual complement. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon
  that a violent shock, like an earthquake, was felt at <a name=
  "Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>Stonehouse and Plymouth. The sky towards
  the dock appeared red, as if from fire, and in a moment the
  streets were crowded with the inhabitants, each asking his
  neighbour what had occurred. When the confusion had somewhat
  abated, it was announced that the Amphion had blown up, and then
  every one hastened to the dock, where a most heartrending scene
  presented itself. Strewed in all directions were pieces of broken
  timber, spars, and rigging, whilst the deck of the hulk, to which
  the frigate had been lashed was red with blood, and covered with
  mangled limbs and lifeless trunks, all blackened with powder. The
  frigate had been originally manned from Plymouth; and as the
  mutilated forms were collected together and carried to the
  hospital, fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters flocked to the
  gates, in their anxiety to discover if their relatives were
  numbered amongst the dying or the dead.</p>

  <p>From the suddenness of the catastrophe, no accurate account
  can of course be given; but the following particulars were
  collected from the survivors.</p>

  <p>The captain, Israel Pellew, was at dinner in his cabin, with
  Captain Swaffield of the Overyssel, a Dutch 64, and the first
  lieutenant of the Amphion, when in an instant they were all
  violently thrown against the carlings of the upper deck. Captain
  Pellew had sufficient presence of mind to rush to the cabin
  window before a second explosion followed, by which he was blown
  into the water; he was soon, however, picked up by a boat, and
  was found to have sustained but little injury.</p>

  <p>The first lieutenant, who followed his example, escaped in a
  similar manner. Unfortunately, Captain Swaffield perished, in all
  probability having been stunned either by the first blow he
  received against the carlings, or by coming in contact with some
  part of the hulk. His body was found a month afterwards, with the
  skull <a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>fractured, apparently
  crushed between the sides of the two vessels.</p>

  <p>At the moment of the explosion, the sentinel at the cabin door
  was looking at his watch, when it was dashed from his hands and
  he was stunned: he knew nothing more until he found himself safe
  on shore, and comparatively unhurt. The escape of the boatswain
  was also very remarkable; he was standing on the cathead,
  directing the men in rigging out the jib-boom, when he felt
  himself suddenly carried off his feet into the air: he then fell
  into the sea senseless; and on recovering his consciousness, he
  found that he had got entangled amongst the rigging, and that his
  arm was broken. He contrived to extricate himself, though with
  some difficulty, and he was soon picked up by a boat, without
  further injury.</p>

  <p>The preservation of a child was no less singular: in the
  terror of the moment, the mother had grasped it in her arms, but,
  horrible to relate, the lower part of her body was blown to
  pieces, whilst the upper part remained unhurt, and it was
  discovered with the arms still clasping the living child to the
  lifeless bosom.</p>

  <p>The exact complement of the Amphion was 215, but from the
  crowded state of her decks at the time of the accident, it is
  supposed that 300, out of 310 or 312 persons, perished with the
  ship.</p>

  <p>The captain, two lieutenants, a boatswain, three or four
  seamen, a marine, one woman, and the child were all that were
  saved.</p>

  <p>The cause of this unfortunate event was never clearly known;
  but it was conjectured that the gunner might have let fall some
  powder near the fore-magazine, which accidentally igniting, had
  communicated with the magazine itself. The gunner had been
  suspected of stealing the powder, and on that day he is said to
  have been intoxicated, and was probably less careful than usual.
  He was amongst the numbers who perished.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="THE_TRIBUNE" id="THE_TRIBUNE"></a>THE TRIBUNE</h2>

  <p>The loss of the TRIBUNE frigate, in November of the following
  year, is too interesting to be omitted.</p>

  <p>At about eight o'clock on the morning of the 16th of November,
  1797, the harbour of Halifax was discovered, and as a strong wind
  blew from the east-south-east, Captain Scory Barker proposed to
  the master to lie to, until a pilot came on board. The master
  replied that there was no necessity for such a measure, as the
  wind was favourable, and he was perfectly well acquainted with
  the passage. The captain confiding in this assurance, went below,
  and the master took charge of the ship.</p>

  <p>Towards noon they approached so near the Thrum Cape shoals,
  that the master became alarmed and sent for Mr. Galvin, one of
  the master's mates. The message was scarcely delivered, before
  the man in the main-chains <a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>sung
  out, 'By the mark five.' In a few minutes after the ship
  struck.</p>

  <p>Signals of distress were immediately made, and as speedily
  answered by the military posts, and the ships in the harbour.</p>

  <p>Some boats put out from the harbour to the assistance of the
  Tribune, and Mr. Rackum, boatswain of the Ordinary, succeeded in
  reaching her in a boat from the dockyard, but all the other boats
  were forced to put back,&mdash;the wind was blowing so hard
  directly against them.</p>

  <p>The ship continued to beat until eight o'clock, P.M., when all
  the guns having been thrown overboard (except one, retained for
  signals), and all means taken to lighten her, she began to heave,
  and in about an hour after she swung off the shoal,&mdash;not,
  however, without having lost her rudder.</p>

  <p>She was then found to have seven feet of water in the hold;
  the chain pumps were instantly manned, and every exertion made to
  save the vessel. At first these efforts seemed to be successful,
  but by ten o'clock the gale had increased to a frightful
  violence, and the water was gaining on them so fast that little
  hope remained. The ship was driving rapidly towards the rocky
  coast, against which she must have been dashed to pieces had she
  kept afloat a few minutes longer, but she gave a lurch and went
  down, rose again for an instant, and with another lurch sank, and
  all was over,&mdash;and there were nearly two hundred and fifty
  human beings struggling with the waves.</p>

  <p>Of all the crew twelve only were saved.</p>

  <p>Mr. Galvin, the master's mate, was below, directing the
  working of the pumps, when the ship went down; he was washed up
  the hatchway, and thence into the sea; he then struck out for the
  shrouds, but was seized by three of his drowning comrades. To
  extricate himself <a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>from their
  grasp, he dived for a few seconds, which caused them to let go
  their hold. He reached the shrouds, which were crowded with
  people, and then climbed to the main-top. Ten men had taken
  refuge in the foretop, and about a hundred persons altogether are
  supposed by Mr. Galvin to have been clinging to the shrouds,
  tops, and other parts of the rigging; but the long November
  night, the intense cold, and the fierce gale, finished the work
  that the waves had left undone; and one by one the poor creatures
  let go their hold, frozen or exhausted, and dropped into the
  foaming sea.</p>

  <p>About forty persons were clinging to the mainmast when it fell
  over, and all were lost, except Mr. Galvin and nine others, who
  had strength enough left to enable them to gain the top, which
  rested on the mainyard, being fortunately sustained by a part of
  the rigging. But of the ten who regained the main-top, four only,
  including Mr. Galvin, survived the night. Of the ten in the
  foretop, six perished, three from exhaustion, and three were
  washed way.</p>

  <p>Here we cannot refrain from relating an instance of the
  coolness which is so often characteristic of the British sailor.
  Amongst those who survived in the foretop were two seamen, Robert
  Dunlap, and Daniel Munroe; the latter disappeared in the night,
  and his companion concluded that he had been washed away with the
  others. About two hours, however, after he had been missed,
  Munroe, to the surprise of Dunlap, thrust his head through the
  lubber's hole. Dunlap asked where he had been.</p>

  <p>'Been.' said Munroe; 'I've been cruizing, d'ye see, in search
  of a better berth.'</p>

  <p>After swimming about the wreck for a considerable time, he had
  returned to the fore-shrouds, and crawling in at the
  cat-harpings, had been sleeping there more than an hour.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>When the morning dawned,
  there were only eight men still alive on the rigging, and no
  effort was made to rescue them until about eleven o'clock, A.M.,
  when a boy of thirteen years of age put out alone, in a small
  skiff from Herring Cove, to their assistance, thus setting a
  noble example of humanity and heroism to older and more
  experienced men, who should have been leaders, and not followers,
  on such an occasion. With great courage and skill, and at the
  peril of his life, he reached the wreck, and backing his skiff
  close to the foretop, carried off two of the people. Upon this
  occasion, also, a noble instance of the magnanimity of the true
  British tar was displayed.</p>

  <p>Munroe and Dunlap, who, during the night, had preserved their
  strength and spirits, and had done everything in their power to
  sustain their less fortunate comrades, refused to quit the wreck
  until the other two men, who were so exhausted as to be unable to
  make any effort for their own safety, were taken on shore. They
  accordingly lifted them into the skiff, and the gallant boy rowed
  them off in triumph to the Cove, and deposited them in safety in
  the nearest cottage.</p>

  <p>He again put off in his skiff, but this time all his efforts
  were unavailing, and he was obliged to return. His gallant
  example, however, had the effect of inducing others to make the
  attempt, and the six survivors were conveyed to the shore in
  large boats.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="THE_RESISTANCE" id="THE_RESISTANCE"></a>THE
  RESISTANCE</h2>

  <p>Before concluding this chapter, we will briefly relate another
  catastrophe, somewhat similar to that of the Amphion, but which
  affords a still more remarkable instance of the preservation of
  four individuals, from one of whom the following particulars were
  ascertained:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>It appears that the RESISTANCE, of 44 guns, Captain Edward
  Pakenham, had anchored in the Straits of Banca, on the 23rd of
  July, 1798. Between three and <a name="Page_9" id=
  "Page_9"></a>four o'clock in the morning of the 24th, the ship
  was struck by lightning: the electric fluid must have penetrated
  and set fire to some part of the vessel near to the magazine, as
  she blew up with a fearful violence a few moments after the
  flash. Thomas Scott, a seaman, one of the few survivors, stated
  that he was lying asleep on the starboard side of the
  quarter-deck, when being suddenly awakened by a bright blaze, and
  the sensation of scorching heat, he found his hair and clothes
  were on fire. A tremendous explosion immediately followed, and he
  became insensible. He supposed that some minutes must have
  elapsed before he recovered, when he found himself, with many of
  his comrades, struggling in the waves amongst pieces of the
  wreck. The Resistance had sunk, but the hammock netting was just
  above water on the starboard side, and with much difficulty Scott
  and the other survivors contrived to reach it. When they were
  able to look around them, they found that twelve men alone
  remained of a crew of above three hundred, including the marines.
  The calmness of the weather enabled the unfortunate sufferers to
  construct a raft with the pieces of timber that were floating
  about; but most of the men were so much bruised and burnt as to
  be unable to assist in the work. The raft was finished about one
  o'clock, P.M., but in a very rough and insecure manner. Part of
  the mainsail attached to the mast of the jolly-boat served them
  for a sail, and they committed themselves to the care of
  Providence upon this frail raft, and made for the nearest shore,
  which was the low land of Sumatra, about three leagues
  distant.</p>

  <p>About seven o'clock in the evening, a gale sprung up, the sea
  ran high, and the lashings of the raft began to give way, the
  planks which formed the platform were washed off, and in a short
  time the mast and sail were also carried away. An anchor-stock
  which formed part <a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>of the raft
  had separated, and was floating away; but although it was at some
  distance, Scott proposed to swim for it, and encouraging three
  others to follow his example, they all reached it in safety. In
  about an hour afterwards they lost sight of their companions on
  the raft, and never saw them more. The four men upon the

  their liberty. Thomas Scott returned with Major Taylor's

  <h2><a name="THE_PROSERPINE" id="THE_PROSERPINE"></a>THE
  PROSERPINE.</h2>

  <p>On Monday, January the 28th, 1799, His Majesty's frigate
  Proserpine, 28 guns, commanded by Captain James Wallis, sailed
  from Yarmouth to Cuxhaven. She had on board the Hon. Thomas
  Grenville, who was the bearer of important despatches for the
  Court of Berlin. On Wednesday, the 30th, the ship was off
  Heligoland, and there took in a pilot for the Elbe. The day being
  fine, with a fair wind from the N.N.E., the Proserpine's course
  was steered for the Red Buoy, where she anchored for the night.
  It was then perceived that the two other buoys at the entrance of
  the river had been removed: a consultation was therefore held
  with the pilots, in the pre<a name="Page_11" id=
  "Page_11"></a>sence of Mr. Grenville, as to the practicability of
  proceeding up the river in the absence of the buoys. The
  Heligoland pilot, and the two belonging to the ship, were
  unanimous in declaring that there was not the slightest
  difficulty or danger in ascending the river; they professed the
  most perfect knowledge of the passage, and assured Captain Wallis
  they had no fear of carrying the vessel to Cuxhaven provided only
  he would proceed between half ebb and half flood tide; for in
  that case they should be able to see the sands and to recognise
  their marks.</p>

  <p>The next morning (31st), the Proserpine was got under weigh,
  and proceeded up the river, having the Prince of Wales packet,
  which had accompanied her from Yarmouth, standing on ahead.</p>

  <p>At four o'clock in the afternoon, when they were within four
  miles of Cuxhaven, the weather became very thick, and some snow
  fell, so that Captain Wallis was obliged to anchor.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock, P.M., the wind changed to east by south,
  blowing a violent gale, accompanied by a heavy fall of snow,
  which made it impossible to see beyond a few feet from the ship;
  and what was still worse, the tide and the wind brought such
  large masses of ice against the ship, that, with all hands upon
  deck, it was with the greatest difficulty they prevented the
  cables being cut, and were able to preserve their station till
  daylight.</p>

  <p>By eight o'clock next morning, the flood tide had carried up
  most of the ice, and left a passage clear below the ship, while
  all above it was blocked tip. The Prince of Wales packet had gone
  on shore during the night; and, warned by her fate, Captain
  Wallis determined to retreat out of the Elbe. Mr. Grenville was
  very anxious to be put on shore as speedily as possible, his
  mission being of much importance; but the river was so completely
  blocked up above them, that there seemed no <a name="Page_12" id=
  "Page_12"></a>possibility of effecting a landing at Cuxhaven:
  Captain Wallis therefore got his ship under weigh, and stood out
  to sea, intending to land Mr. Grenville on the nearest part of
  the coast of Jutland, if it were practicable.</p>

  <p>The pilots were congratulating the captain on the frigate's
  getting safely out of the river, and clear of the sands, and the
  people had been allowed to go to breakfast, on the supposition
  that all danger was past, when the vessel struck upon Scharborn
  Sand, with Newark Island bearing south by east, at half-past nine
  o'clock, A.M.</p>

  <p>As it was blowing a very strong gale of wind, the Proserpine
  struck with great force, though she carried no other canvass than
  her foretopmast stay-sail. Upon sounding there was found to be
  only ten feet of water under the fore part of her keel.</p>

  <p>The boats were immediately lowered to carry out an anchor, but
  the ice was returning upon them so fast that this was found
  impossible, and the boats were hoisted on board again. All hands
  were then employed to shore the ship up, and make her heel
  towards the bank, to prevent her falling into the stream, which
  would have been certain destruction. Happily this object was
  effected; for as the tide ebbed, she lay towards the bank.</p>

  <p>The next tide, however, brought down such huge masses of ice
  that the shores were carried away&mdash;the copper was torn from
  the starboard quarter, and the rudder cut in two, the lower part
  lying on the ice under the counter.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding all these disasters, Captain Wallis still
  hoped to get the ship off at high water, and to effect this, they
  proceeded to lighten her by throwing most of her guns and part of
  her stores overboard, all of which were borne up on the ice. One
  party was employed in hoisting out the provisions, another in
  starting the casks of wine and spirits; and such were the
  <a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>good discipline and right
  feeling of the men, that not one instance of intoxication
  occurred.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock on Friday night, they abandoned all hope of
  saving the vessel; it was then high water, yet the heavy gale
  from the south-east so kept back the tide, that upon sounding,
  they found three feet less water than there had been in the
  morning, when the ship first struck.</p>

  <p>The situation of the crew was dreadful. When the tide ebbed,
  they expected every moment that the ship would be driven to
  pieces by the ice. The cold was intense, and the darkness such
  that it was almost impossible to distinguish one another upon
  deck; and the snow, falling very thick, was driven against their
  faces by the wind, and froze upon them as it fell.</p>

  <p>There was no possibility of keeping up warmth and circulation
  in their bodies, for the frozen snow and ice made the deck so
  slippery they could scarcely stand, much less walk about quickly,
  and all they could do was, to try to screen themselves as much as
  possible from the pitiless blast. Thus the night was spent in
  anxious fears for the future, and dread of immediate destruction.
  But morning came at last, though with little comfort to the
  sufferers, for the wind had increased, the ice was up to the
  cabin windows, the stern-post was found to be broken in two, and
  the ship otherwise seriously damaged.</p>

  <p>In this state they could not long remain. Mr. Grenville and
  some of the officers proposed to Captain Wallis that the crew
  should make an attempt to get over the ice to Newark Island, as
  the only means of preserving their lives.<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
  id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class=
  "fnanchor">[4]</a> <a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>At first,
  Captain Wallis was inclined to reject the proposal; he saw all
  the danger attending such an attempt; and it appeared to him,
  that they could scarcely expect to succeed in crossing the ice
  through a dense fog and heavy snow-storm, without any knowledge
  of the way, without a guide, and exhausted as they were by mental
  and bodily suffering, and benumbed with cold.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, he confessed that the plan presented a hope
  of safety, and that it was their only hope. The ship's company
  were unanimous in wishing to adopt it, and therefore Captain
  Wallis finally consented.</p>

  <p>The people then set heartily to work to consider the
  difficulties of the undertaking, and the best means of meeting
  them. It was determined that they should be divided into four
  companies, each headed by an officer; that the strongest of the
  men should carry planks, to be laid down in the most dangerous
  places by way of assistance to the less able and active of the
  party; and that others should hold a long line of extended rope,
  to be instantly available in case of any one falling between the
  blocks of ice.</p>

  <p>When all these measures were decided upon, and every man had
  provided himself with what was most essential for his safety and
  sustenance, they began their perilous journey at half-past one
  o'clock, P.M. By three o'clock, every one had left the ship,
  except Captain Wallis, and he then followed the party,
  accompanied by Lieutenant Ridley, of the Marines.</p>

  <p>To describe the dangers and difficulties the crew of the
  <a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>Proserpine had to encounter is
  almost impossible. The snow was still falling heavily, driving
  against their faces, and adhering to their hair and eyebrows,
  where in a few minutes it became solid pieces of ice. Sometimes
  they had to clamber over huge blocks of ice, and at other times
  were obliged to plunge through snow and water reaching to their
  middle.</p>

  <p>As the wind blew from the direction in which they were
  proceeding, the large flakes of snow were driven into their eyes,
  and prevented them from seeing many yards in advance. This caused
  them to deviate from their proper course, and to travel in a
  direction which, if continued, would have carried them off the
  shoal and field of ice into the sea, or at least have taken them
  so far from any place of shelter, as to have left them to perish
  in the ice and snow during the night.</p>

  <p>This dreadful calamity was, however, prevented, by one of the
  party having in his possession a pocket compass. Fortunately,
  bearings had been taken previous to their leaving the wreck. The
  course they were pursuing was examined, and to their surprise it
  was discovered that they had been deviating widely from the
  direct line which they ought to have pursued. This, however,
  enabled the party to correct the march, and after a toilsome
  journey of six miles, they at length reached Newark.</p>

  <p>In the course of their hazardous journey, a striking instance
  was afforded of the inscrutable ways of Providence. Two females
  were on board the Proserpine when she was stranded,&mdash;one a
  strong healthy woman, accustomed to the hardships of a maritime
  life: the other exactly the reverse, weak and delicate, had never
  been twelve hours on board a ship until the evening previous to
  the frigate's sailing from Yarmouth. Her husband had been lately
  impressed, and she had come on board for the purpose of taking
  farewell. Owing <a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>to a sudden
  change of the weather, and the urgency of the mission for which
  the Proserpine had been despatched, she had been unable to quit
  the ship. The poor creature was upon the eve of her confinement,
  and naturally being but ill prepared to combat with the
  inconvenience of a ship at sea, in the course of the day she was
  delivered of a dead child. The reader can well imagine the
  sufferings endured by this helpless woman, with but one of her
  own sex to tend her, in a vessel tossed about in the stormy seas
  of the Northern Ocean.</p>

  <p>But this was little compared with what she had yet to undergo.
  Before many hours the frigate stranded: the night was passed in
  torture of mind and body, and then was she compelled, with
  others, to quit the ship, and travel through masses of snow and
  ice, and to combat with the bitter north wind, hail, and
  sleet.</p>

  <p>It may well be supposed that her strength, already weakened by
  the sufferings she had undergone, was totally unprepared to bear
  up against a trial from which the strongest of the crew might
  have shrunk; but it turned out otherwise. The robust, healthy
  woman, with her feeble companion, left the wreck together, the
  former bearing in her arms an infant of nine months old. No doubt
  many a ready arm was stretched forth to assist them in their
  perilsome journey. But man could have done but little against the
  piercing winter's blast with which they had to contend. Before
  they had proceeded half the distance, the child was frozen in its
  mother's arms, and ere long the mother herself sunk on the snow,
  fell into a state of stupor, and died. Not so the delicate
  invalid; sustained by help from above, she still pursued her way,
  and ere long gained with others the hospitable shore. The
  inhabitants of the village received the strangers with great
  kindness, and did everything in their power to alleviate their
  sufferings. The ship's <a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>company
  were distributed amongst them for the night, but the poverty of
  the place afforded them little more than shelter.</p>

  <p>The next morning a general muster was made, and it was
  ascertained that, of the whole company, twelve seamen, a woman,
  and her child, only were missing; these had either been frozen to
  death, or had died from the effects of cold, and the loss was
  small when compared with the hardships they had suffered. Several
  men had their legs and fingers frozen, but through proper medical
  treatment they all recovered.</p>

  <p>The storm lasted without intermission till the night of the
  5th, and during that time the crew of the Proserpine were
  suffering much from the want of necessary food, clothing, &amp;c.
  Provisions were so scarce that they were all put upon short
  allowance; and their scanty store being nearly exhausted, it
  became absolutely necessary that part of them should proceed to
  Cuxhaven.</p>

  <p>They learnt that at low water it was possible to get to
  Cuxhaven on foot; and as some of the islanders offered their
  services as guides, and the tide served, it was settled that the
  first lieutenant and half the officers and men should start with
  the guides on the morning of the 6th.</p>

  <p>Mr. Grenville being very anxious to proceed on his mission to
  Berlin, determined to accompany the party, with the secretary to
  the embassy, and some of the servants; and they accordingly all
  set off at eight o'clock in the morning, the severity of the
  weather having somewhat abated.</p>

  <p>Great as had been the difficulties they had encountered in
  their passage from the Proserpine to Newark Island, the dangers
  of their present expedition, over sand and ice, were nearly as
  formidable. At one part of their journey they found themselves on
  the banks of a river. The guides had assured them it was only a
  very narrow <a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>stream, and would
  most probably be frozen over: it proved, however, to be a river
  of considerable width; the ice was broken and floating upon it in
  large masses; the tide, too, was rising, and altogether the
  passage presented a formidable appearance. There was little time
  for deliberation, so the word was given to push forward, and the
  next moment they were up to their waists in the water, struggling
  against the tide and the large flakes of ice, which swept against
  them with such force that they had great difficulty in keeping
  their footing.</p>

  <p>But through the mercy of Providence they all reached the
  opposite bank in safety, and before evening they arrived at
  Cuxhaven, without the loss of a single man. Many of them were
  more or less frost-bitten, but by rubbing the parts affected with
  snow, circulation was restored.</p>

  <p>We must now return to Captain Wallis and the officers and men
  who had remained with him at Newark, in hopes of being able to
  save some of the stores from the frigate.</p>

  <p>On Friday, the 8th, Mr. Anthony, the master, volunteered with
  a party to endeavour to ascertain the state of the vessel, and if
  possible to bring away some bread, of which they were in much
  need.</p>

  <p>They had great difficulty in reaching the ship, which they
  found lying on her beam ends, with seven feet and a half of water
  in her hold, having her quarter-deck separated six feet from her
  gangway, and apparently only-kept together by the vast quantity
  of ice which surrounded her.</p>

  <p>From this report, it was deemed unadvisable to make any more
  expeditions to the ship; but on the 10th, the clearness of the
  day induced Mr. Anthony, in company with the surgeon, a
  midshipman, the boatswain, and two seamen, to go off a second
  time.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>Those who remained at
  Newark anxiously expected the return of the party, but they came
  not. Evening advanced, the tide was flowing, and at last it was
  too late for them to cross the sands and ice till the next ebb.
  The watchers were obliged to content themselves with the hope
  that Mr. Anthony and his party had found it safe and practicable
  to remain on board the frigate till morning. But during the night
  a violent storm arose, which increased the anxiety of Captain
  Wallis for the safety of his people; and this anxiety became deep
  distress, when in the morning he gazed wistfully towards the
  wreck, and saw nothing but the foaming waters, and moving fields
  of ice. Not a vestige of the frigate was visible. We cannot
  better describe Captain Wallis's feelings on this occasion than
  by quoting his own words, when he communicated the intelligence
  to Vice-Admiral Archibald Dickson.</p>

  <p>'They got on board,' says Captain Wallis, 'but unfortunately
  neglected, until too late in the tide, to return, which left them
  no alternative but that of remaining on board till next day.
  About ten o'clock at night the wind came on at S.S.E., and blew a
  most violent storm; the tide, though at the neap, rose to an
  uncommon height, the ice got in motion, the velocity of which
  swept the wreck to destruction, (for in the morning not a vestige
  of her was to be seen,) and with it, I am miserably afraid, went
  the above unfortunate officers and men,&mdash;and if so, their
  loss will be a great one to the service, as, in their different
  departments, they were a great acquisition to it.</p>

  <p>'The only hope I have is, that Providence which has so
  bountifully assisted us in our recent dangers and difficulties,
  may be extended towards them, so as to preserve their lives, by
  means of boat or otherwise; but I am very sorry to say my hopes
  are founded on the <a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>most
  distant degree of human probability. This melancholy accident
  happening so unexpectedly, added to my other misfortunes, has
  given so severe a shock to my health and spirits, as to prevent
  me hitherto undertaking the journey to Cuxhaven, where the
  survivors of the ship's company now are, except a few who are
  here with me, with whom I shall set out as soon as we are
  able.'</p>

  <p>It is now necessary that we should follow the proceedings of
  Mr. Anthony and his party.</p>

  <p>They reached the wreck at ten o'clock on Sunday morning; but,
  being busily occupied in collecting what stores they could, they
  neglected to watch the tide, and whilst they were thus employed,
  the time passed over, and the waves rolling between them and
  their temporary home at Newark; they were obliged to wait till
  the next day's ebb. During the night, as we have stated, the wind
  changed to the S.S.E.: it blew a violent gale, and the tide rose
  to such an unusual height, that it floated the ship, and the ice
  that had stuck to her, without the men on board being aware of
  it. The next morning, to their horror and dismay, they found the
  vessel drifting out to the ocean. We can scarcely imagine a
  situation more terrible than that in which these unfortunate men
  were placed. They were in all six persons, four officers and two
  seamen, and these few hands had to manage a frigate of 28 guns,
  which was actually going to pieces, and it was impossible to
  conjecture how long she might swim. She was merely buoyed up on
  the sea by the fields of ice that surrounded her; and if the ice
  were to break away, in all probability she would not hold
  together for an hour.</p>

  <p>Mr. Anthony and his companions did not, however, give way to
  despair, nor lose time in useless repining. They set to work
  immediately, to avoid the danger as far as circumstances would
  permit.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>Their first care was to
  drop the lead between two of the masses of ice, and they found
  that the ship was floating in eleven fathoms. They then fired
  several guns, to give warning of their situation. By turns they
  worked at the pumps, and, in order to lighten the vessel, threw
  all the remaining guns, except four, overboard&mdash;a labour of
  no small magnitude for six men to perform.</p>

  <p>Their next object was to get up the tackles for hoisting out
  the boat, in case of their getting into clear water, or being
  obliged to quit the wreck.</p>

  <p>There was one advantage in all this hard labour, to which most
  of them were unaccustomed: it prevented their suffering so much
  as they otherwise must have done from the extreme cold; and in
  one respect they were better off than their comrades at Newark,
  for they had plenty of provisions on board. So passed the first
  day on the wreck.</p>

  <p>The next morning, Tuesday, the 12th, at about eleven o'clock,
  land was descried on their lee, on which they fired several guns,
  and hauled the colours on the main-rigging, union downwards, as a
  signal of distress. An hour afterwards the ship struck on a rock
  off the island of Baltrum, about a mile and a-half distant from
  the shore.</p>

  <p>Mr. Anthony and his companions then tried to launch the
  cutter, but they were obliged to give up the attempt, as the sea
  was not sufficiently clear of ice; they therefore remained on
  board another night.</p>

  <p>The next morning, however, they hoisted out the boat, and
  pulled towards the shore; but they had not gone more than half
  way, when they were surrounded by fields of ice, so that they
  were obliged to get upon the ice, and drag the boat with
  them.</p>

  <p>About noon they had reached to within a cable's length of the
  shore, and here they were compelled to leave the boat: they were
  all completely exhausted, and <a name="Page_22" id=
  "Page_22"></a>found it impossible to drag her any further. They
  themselves had to leap from one piece of ice to another, often
  falling into the water; and it was at the imminent risk of their
  lives that they at last gained the beach.</p>

  <p>They were tolerably well received by the inhabitants, who took
  them to their houses, and allowed them to seek that repose which
  they so much needed.</p>

  <p>The next day the islanders, unable to resist the temptation of
  plunder, took to their boats, and made off to the ship, which
  they ransacked, and carried off all the arms, stores, and
  provisions of every kind. In vain Mr. Anthony protested against
  this base conduct: it was as much as he could do to persuade them
  to spare some part of the provisions for himself and his
  friends.</p>

  <p>The party were obliged to remain at Baltrum amongst their
  rapacious hosts until Saturday, the 16th, when they deemed that
  the ice was sufficiently cleared away to allow of their sailing
  for Cuxhaven; they accordingly secured the cutter and took their
  departure. As there was not the remotest chance of getting the
  Proserpine afloat again, they abandoned her to the island
  plunderers. They reached Cuxhaven about the 22nd, and there they
  found Lieutenant Wright and those who had accompanied him from
  Newark.</p>

  <p>On the following day, Captain Wallis arrived, with the rest of
  the ship's company, the sick and wounded. We can imagine the joy
  and gratitude with which Captain Wallis received the announcement
  of the safe arrival of Mr. Anthony and his friends, whom he had
  deplored as lost.</p>

  <p>Thus were the crew of the Proserpine, with the exception of
  thirteen persons, brought once more together after three weeks
  endurance of innumerable hardships, and having been exposed to
  many perils. Never was the Almighty hand of Providence more
  visibly displayed <a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>than in the
  protection afforded to these gallant fellows; and never did men
  do more to help themselves than they did, We cannot but admire
  the calm courage they evinced throughout that long and dismal
  night when almost certain destruction awaited them; as well as
  their obedience and cheerful alacrity through their toilsome
  march from the wreck to Newark, and again from Newark to
  Cuxhaven. Nor must we forget the fortitude displayed by Mr.
  Anthony and his companions, when they were a second time wrecked
  in the Proserpine.</p>

  <p>Throughout the history of their dangers and sufferings from
  cold and hunger, and the other evils attending a shipwreck on
  such an inhospitable shore and in such a climate, there is no
  mention of one single instance of murmuring, discontent, or
  disobedience of orders.</p>

  <p>When the Elbe was again navigable and free from ice, the crew
  embarked in different packets and sailed for England, where they
  all arrived without further disasters.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_SCEPTRE" id="THE_SCEPTRE"></a><a name="Page_24"
  id="Page_24"></a>THE SCEPTRE.</h2>

  <p>Early in the spring of 1799, a large convoy of transports and
  merchantmen sailed from the Cape of Good Hope, with troops and
  stores for the siege of Seringapatam. The Sceptre, 64 guns,
  commanded by Captain Valentine Edwards, was appointed to the sole
  charge of the convoy, and to take Sir David Baird and the whole
  of the 84th regiment on board. The Sceptre may, perhaps, have
  been the only king's ship then at the Cape; it is certain that
  she had been an unusual length of time on that station, and had
  become so weak and leaky as to be hardly sea-worthy, when she was
  dispatched on this important service.</p>

  <p>Happily, the insecure state of the vessel induced extreme
  watchfulness on the part of both officers and men, and all went
  on well till she had made about two-thirds of her way, when one
  night a brisk gale sprung up, which increased in violence so
  rapidly, that the officers of the watch felt some anxiety on
  account of the unusual strain upon the ship. Captain Edwards
  ordered the well to be sounded, and the result confirming his
  apprehensions, the pumps were manned in an incredibly short time,
  every one on board being aroused to a sense of danger.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant the Honourable Alexander Jones had been relieved
  from the first watch, and had retired to his berth about an hour
  before without any misgivings. He was suddenly awakened by the
  alarming cry that the ship was sinking, and the call of 'all
  hands,' He sprang up, and in a few moments joined the group of
  officers, naval <a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>and military,
  assembled on the quarter-deck. Anxiety was depicted on every
  countenance; for although the pumps were worked incessantly, the
  soldiers taking their turn with the sailors, the water was still
  gaining on them fast; and even whilst the men relieved each
  other, it rose several inches. But when human efforts were
  unavailing, the hand of Providence was stretched out to save. The
  wind fell as suddenly as it had risen, and after many hours of
  hard labour, the water was got under, and the vessel was
  considered comparatively safe.</p>

  <p>Had the Sceptre gone down that night, hundreds and hundreds of
  England's best and bravest defenders must have sunk into a watery
  grave, and in all probability the enemy's ships, which were
  hovering upon the track of the convoy, would have got possession
  of the transports and merchantmen; and even the success of our
  arms in India might have been seriously affected.</p>

  <p>A few weeks after the gale we have mentioned, the Sceptre and
  her convoy arrived safely at Bombay. She was there put into dock
  and repaired, and was strengthened by having large timbers,
  technically termed riders, bolted diagonally on either side, fore
  and aft.</p>

  <p>When again fit for sea, she returned to Table Bay, and
  anchored there about the middle of October.</p>

  <p>On the 1st of November, the captain and officers gave a ball
  to the inhabitants of Cape Town, and on that night the ship
  presented an appearance of unusual gaiety; mirth and music
  resounded on all sides; in place of the stern voice of command,
  the laugh, the jest, and the soft tones of woman's voice were
  heard; whilst many a light footstep glided over the decks of the
  old ship.</p>

  <p>The night was calm and beautiful, and as the guests left the
  ship, little did they think of the fearful doom that was so soon
  to overwhelm many of those whose hands they had clasped for the
  last time.</p>

  <p>The weather continued perfectly calm till the evening of the
  4th of November, when some ominous looking clouds indicated an
  approaching storm.</p>

  <p>In addition to the Sceptre there remained in the Bay the
  Jupiter of 50 guns, the Oldenburg, a Danish 64 gun ship, and
  several other vessels. On the morning of the 5th, a strong gale
  blew from the north-west, but no danger was apprehended, and the
  ship, dressed in flags, and with the royal standard hoisted,
  fired her salute at noon in commemoration of the Gunpowder
  Treason.</p>

  <p>The gale had increased considerably by two o'clock, and as
  Table Bay affords no shelter from a north-west wind, the captain
  took every precaution to make all secure: the topmasts were
  struck, and the fore and main-yards were lowered to ease the
  ship. But half-an-hour had not elapsed before the violence of the
  storm was such, that the ship parted from her best bower cable;
  the sheet anchor was immediately let go, and the cable veered
  away to twenty-eight fathoms. The storm gathered strength, and at
  half-past six the whole fury of the elements seemed to be
  concentrated in one terrific blast.</p>

  <p>Orders were given to let go the anchor, with two of the
  forecastle guns attached; but even this proved insufficient to
  hold the ship.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>One of the boats was then
  hoisted out, in order to communicate with the Jupiter, and
  procure the end of a cable from her, but in a few minutes the
  boat upset and was lost, with all her crew. For some hours signal
  guns of distress had been fired, and the ensign had been hoisted
  downwards, but no help could reach the vessel: in that
  tempestuous sea no boat could live. Some of the officers who had
  gone on shore the previous evening were standing on the beach,
  unable to render any assistance to their comrades, and compelled
  to remain inactive spectators of the harrowing scene, and to
  behold their brave ship foundering at her anchors.</p>

  <p>About eight o'clock, loud above the howling of the tempest and
  the booming of the minute gun, arose the wild cry of <i>fire</i>:
  and thick smoke was discernible from the shore, issuing from the
  hatches. Now were the opposing elements of air, fire, and water
  combined for the destruction of the ill-fated ship. For an
  instant, all stood paralysed; but it was only for an instant.
  Again the voices of the officers were raised in command, and
  every man was ready at his post.</p>

  <p>The smoke came up from the hatches in such dense volumes, that
  all attempts to go below to extinguish the fire were abortive.
  Each man felt that his last hour was come,&mdash;there was not a
  shadow of hope that their lives could be saved; it was but a
  choice of death by fire or water: to quit the ship must be fatal;
  they had seen the boat and its crew swallowed up by the yawning
  waves, when the tempest raged less fiercely than now, and she was
  too far from the shore to afford even a ray of hope that the
  strongest swimmer might gain the beach. On the other hand, to
  remain on board was to encounter a still more terrible
  death&mdash;a burning funeral pile amidst the waters. While they
  hesitated in doubt and horror, <a name="Page_28" id=
  "Page_28"></a>one of their fears was relieved,&mdash;the heavy
  sea that washed incessantly over the wreck extinguished the fire.
  The ship continued to drive at the mercy of the waves till about
  ten o'clock, when she stranded, broadside to the shore, heeling
  on her port side towards the sea.</p>

  <p>The captain then ordered the main and mizen masts to be cut
  away, and the foremast soon afterwards went by the board. At this
  juncture, a man of the name of Connolly, a favourite with both
  officers and crew, volunteered to jump overboard with a deep-sea
  line attached to his body, in order to form a communication
  between the ship and the shore. He made but a few strokes ere he
  was borne away by the eddy and drowned.</p>

  <p>The ship being lightened by the falling of the masts, righted
  herself and got clear off the ground: there appeared some slight
  chance of preservation, and every heart was buoyed up with hope
  that she might be thrown high enough upon the beach to enable the
  people on shore to render them some assistance.</p>

  <p>She was driven nearer and nearer to the land&mdash;voices
  became more and more audible, so as even to be recognised&mdash;-
  in a few minutes more, the perishing crew might be
  safe&mdash;when a heavy sea struck the ship, the orlop deck gave
  way, and the port side fell in&mdash;many were swept
  away,&mdash;those who had the power to do so, retreated to the
  starboard side.</p>

  <p>A most heartrending scene must that have been! The people were
  so benumbed with cold and exhaustion, and paralysed by fear, that
  many of them could no longer cling to the ropes and spars for
  support, and every wave that broke over the wreck, washed away
  its victims.</p>

  <p>Many in despair leaped overboard, and attempted to swim to
  shore, but the eddy caused by the wreck was so <a name="Page_29"
  id="Page_29"></a>strong, that they were carried out to sea; and
  in spite of the attempts made by those on board to rescue them,
  they all perished. Mr. Tucker, a midshipman, lost his life in the
  endeavour to reach the bow of the ship.</p>

  <p>About half an hour later the poop was washed away, and carried
  towards the shore. Seventy or eighty men who were upon it seemed
  likely to be saved from the surrounding destruction. The people
  on the beach crowded to the spot where they would probably be
  driven, that they might render every possible assistance; but
  what was their horror to see a tremendous wave strike the poop,
  capsize it, and turn it over and over; whilst every one of those
  who clung to it perished!</p>

  <p>But the terrors of that awful night were not yet exhausted.
  The wreck, to which the remaining officers and men were clinging,
  heeled towards the shore; but when the gale increased and blew
  with redoubled force, it heeled off again, rent fore and aft, and
  parted in two places&mdash;before the main-chains, and abaft the
  fore-chains&mdash;and then all disappeared from the eyes of the
  awe-stricken spectators on the beach.</p>

  <p>High above the crash of timbers and the roaring of the blast,
  rose the despairing cry of hundreds of human beings who perished
  in the waters, and whose mutilated forms, with the fragments of
  the wreck, strewed the beach for miles on the following
  morning.</p>

  <p>Thirty or forty seamen and marines still clung to the bow, the
  sea breaking over them incessantly; they kept their hold,
  however, in the fond hope that the signal gun remaining, might by
  its weight prevent the bow from being capsized; but the timbers,
  unable to resist the fury of the tempest, suddenly
  parted,&mdash;the gun reeled from side to side, and the unhappy
  men shared the fate of their companions. It has been said that
  during that awful time, whilst threatened with instant death,
  many <a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>of these men were in a
  stupor, with their hands locked in the chain plates.</p>

  <p>Among the incidents connected with the wreck, it is related
  that Mr. Buddle, a midshipman, (one of the few who escaped,) was
  cast upon the waves almost insensible. He had not strength to
  strike out for the beach, and he therefore merely tried to keep
  himself above water. This proved to be the means of saving his
  life, for he floated in a direction parallel with the shore, and
  avoided the huge pieces of wreck by which all his companions who
  made directly for land (excepting three) were dashed to
  pieces.</p>

  <p>Mr. Buddle was nearly exhausted, when he caught hold of a
  small piece of timber that was floating near him; a nail which
  projected from it wounded him on the breast; he fainted, and did
  not recover his senses until he found himself lying on the beach
  upon a heap of dead bodies. He attempted in vain to rise; for
  though he felt no pain, his left leg was broken, his knee cut
  almost half through, and his body much bruised. In this state he
  was discovered, and carried by some persons to a large fire until
  further assistance could be obtained, and he was then conveyed to
  the hospital.</p>

  <p>One of the officers of the Sceptre, who is still alive, and
  who happened to be on shore at the time this terrible catastrophe
  occurred, declares, that nothing imagination could conceive ever
  equalled the horrors of that night. When the first signals of
  distress were made from the Sceptre, the whole population of Cape
  Town, with the officers and soldiers of the garrison, crowded
  down to the beach, in the vain hope of being able to afford some
  assistance. The night was bitterly cold; the wind blew with
  terrific violence, and the sea, lashed into fury, broke with a
  deafening roar upon the beach. As night approached, and darkness
  hid the vessel from their sight, <a name="Page_31" id=
  "Page_31"></a>the feelings of the agonized spectators became
  almost insupportable. The booming of the guns alone told that the
  ship still lived among the raging waters; whilst ever and anon a
  piercing shriek announced that the work of death had begun.</p>

  <p>All along the beach large fires were lighted, as beacons to
  guide those who might be cast upon the shore. At length the ship
  was driven nearer, and again she became visible from the land.
  She appeared, says an eye-witness (before mentioned), like a huge
  castle looming in the distance. The hopes of the spectators
  revived as she heeled on towards them, and they all stood ready
  to give assistance whenever it should be available. At one
  moment, a fearful crash was heard&mdash;next, a piercing shriek,
  and the flash of the torches waved in the air displayed the
  struggling forms of the drowning seamen, tossed to and fro upon
  the waves amongst masses of the wreck, which, in many instances,
  killed those whom the waters would have spared.</p>

  <p>The only help that the people on shore could render to the
  unhappy sufferers was, to watch the opportunity when the waves
  brought a body near to the land, and then to rush into the water,
  holding one another at arm's length, and to grasp the exhausted
  creature before he was borne back by the receding wave.</p>

  <p>In this manner forty-seven men were saved, together with Mr.
  Shaw, a master's mate, and two midshipmen, of the names of Spinks
  and Buddle, before-mentioned. Six officers had fortunately been
  on shore at the time; all the others, with the captain, were lost
  on the wreck, together with about three hundred and ninety-one
  seamen and marines.</p>

  <p>The people of Cape Town and the troops were employed the whole
  night in searching for the dead, amongst whom they discovered the
  son of Captain Edwards, with <a name="Page_32" id=
  "Page_32"></a>one hand grasping an open Bible, which was pressed
  to his bosom, the parting gift, perhaps, of a fond mother, who
  had taught the boy to revere in life that sacred volume, from
  which he parted not in death.</p>

  <p>Three waggon-loads of the dead were next morning taken to a
  place near the hospital, and there buried. About one hundred
  bodies, shockingly mangled, were buried in one pit on the beach.
  The remains of all the officers (with the exception of Captain
  Edwards) were found, and were interred the following Sunday with
  military honours.</p>

  <p>The reader may be interested by being informed of a few of the
  providential escapes which were experienced by Lieutenant Jones
  (now Rear-Admiral Jones), one of the few survivors of the
  catastrophe above described. This officer had been midshipman of
  the Providence, discovery-ship, commanded by Captain William
  Broughton, which vessel, after many dangerous vicissitudes, was
  finally wrecked among the Japanese islands. Mr. Jones having
  faced all the dangers consequent on such a trying position, with
  difficulty escaped a watery grave, by taking refuge, with the
  rest of the officers and crew, on board the tender which
  accompanied this ill-fated ship. This great addition to her small
  complement, and her want of accommodation, produced a virulent
  disease amongst the crew, from which Sir. Jones did not escape.
  On arrival at Macao, Mr. Jones was ordered a passage, with his
  surviving shipmates and crew of the Providence, to England, in
  the Swift, sloop of war, selected to convoy a large fleet of
  Indiamen. The evening before their departure, it was found that
  the accommodation in the Swift was not sufficient for the
  supernumeraries, and, consequently, Mr. Jones and Lord George
  Stuart (also a midshipman of the Providence) were, by order of
  Captain Broughton, distributed among the mer<a name="Page_33" id=
  "Page_33"></a>chant ships, the former to the Carnatic, the latter
  to the Duke of Buccleugh. The Swift and her convoy sailed on the
  morrow. They had not proceeded far, before a succession of
  violent typhoons overtook them, which scattered and disabled the
  Indiamen, most of which were obliged to return to India; but the
  Swift foundered: she was seen for a short time struggling with
  the elements, and making signals of distress&mdash;a moment more,
  and she disappeared for ever.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Jones, arriving at the Cape of Good Hope, was detained by
  Rear Admiral Pringle, and employed to communicate with his
  flag-ship, the Tremendous, then in a state of mutiny, the
  mutineers having put her officers ashore. His courage on this
  occasion was much lauded, as it was believed by all, and expected
  by himself, that he would have been thrown overboard. Harmony was
  at length restored on board the Tremendous, and six of the
  mutineers were executed. As a reward for his services, Mr. Jones
  was appointed acting lieutenant of the Sceptre: his preservation,
  and the part he acted on that occasion, have already been
  described.</p>

  <p>When lieutenant of the Ajax, attached to the fleet under Sir
  J. Borlase Warren, lying in Vigo Bay, he was sent with a boat's
  crew to the assistance of the Tartarus, sloop of war, which ship
  was then driving to leeward in a gale on a rocky shore. So
  inevitable appeared her destruction, that the officers and crew
  had abandoned her, after letting go an anchor, to retard her
  expected crash against the rocks. At this critical moment, whilst
  held by only one strand of the cable, Lieutenant Jones's boat
  (although nearly swamped by the frequent shipping of seas) neared
  the ship; and this officer, watching an opportunity, sprung on
  board with his intrepid crew, and, by almost superhuman
  exertions, succeeded in hauling her ahead. She had just reached
  the point of <a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>safety, when her
  officers and crew, who witnessed her more favourable position,
  brought about by Lieutenant Jones's courage and perseverance,
  returned on board, and Lieutenant Jones and his gallant followers
  rejoined their ship amidst the cheers of the fleet. For this
  service Lieutenant Jones was sent for by the commander-in-chief,
  and thanked by him on the quarter-deck of his flag-ship.</p>

  <p>As lieutenant of the Naiad, this officer had the misfortune to
  be involved in a serious quarrel with his superior officer
  (Lieutenant Dean), and on that person using very abusive, and
  unofficer-like language, Lieutenant Jones struck him. A court
  martial being held, Lieutenant Jones was sentenced to be hanged;
  but, in consideration of the very provoking language used by
  Lieutenant Dean, and Lieutenant Jones's previous irreproachable
  conduct, his Majesty George the Third was graciously pleased to
  pardon him, and restore him to his former position in the Navy,
  while Lieutenant Dean was dismissed the service.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_QUEEN_CHARLOTTE" id=
  "THE_QUEEN_CHARLOTTE"></a><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>THE
  QUEEN CHARLOTTE.</h2>

  <p>One of the greatest calamities that ever befel a ship
  belonging to the British Navy was the destruction of the Queen
  Charlotte of 100 guns, launched in 1790. She was the sister-ship
  to the Royal George, and was destined to a no less tragical fate.
  Her first cruise was with the fleet fitted out against Spain;
  Lord Howe, the commander-in-chief, being on board of her; and she
  carried his flag on the 1st of June.</p>

  <p>She was afterwards sent to the Mediterranean, under the
  command of Captain James Todd, and bearing the flag of
  Vice-Admiral Lord Keith. Before entering upon our narrative, we
  may be permitted to apologize for any inaccuracy, or lack of
  incident, that may be apparent in the following account, by
  stating that the official reports of the disaster are so vague
  and imperfect, that it is almost impossible to give the details
  of it as fully as we could wish; and so many years have elapsed
  since the event, that we cannot obtain information from private
  sources.</p>

  <p>On the 16th of March, 1800, Lord Keith, with Lieutenant
  Stewart, and four other persons, having landed at Leghorn,
  directed Captain Todd to proceed in the Queen Charlotte to
  reconnoitre the Island of Cabrera, about thirty miles from
  Leghorn, then in possession of the French, and which it was his
  lordship's intention to attack.</p>

  <p>At four o'clock on the morning of the 17th, the men who were
  washing the decks stowed some hay close aft to the admiral's
  cabin, near a match-tub, in which it was usual to keep a match
  burning, for the purpose of firing signals. At six o'clock, when
  the men were in the act of <a name="Page_36" id=
  "Page_36"></a>removing the hay, a portion of it was discovered to
  have ignited. Not a moment was lost in giving the alarm, and
  those at hand used every means in their power to extinguish the
  slumbering element; but the fire had been smouldering for some
  time before it was discovered. The water thrown upon it from the
  buckets was useless&mdash;the flames bursting forth with such
  violence that they baffled the most strenuous efforts to overcome
  them. Such was the posture of affairs when the captain, officers,
  and men, alarmed by the cry of fire, rushed from all parts of the
  ship to the scene of conflagration. It would be no easy task to
  describe the feelings of a number of human beings thus suddenly
  and awfully awakened to the perils of their situation. For the
  moment, no doubt, fear predominated over every other feeling, and
  a degree of confusion ensued. Nor can this be regarded with
  astonishment, when we remember that of all the dangers to which a
  sailor is familiarized in his hazardous profession, none is so
  fraught with horror as a fire at sea.</p>

  <p>The battle has no terror for him: he rushes to the conflict
  excited by the cheers of his comrades and the hopes of
  victory&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span>Though fore and aft the blood-stained
      deck,<br /></span> <span class="i2">Should lifeless trunks
      appear,<br /></span> <span>Or should the vessel float a
      wreck,<br /></span> <span class="i2">The sailor knows no
      fear.<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He glories in the stormy sea, and in 'the wild wind's roar:'
  they fill him with a fierce delight, while with steady hand and
  steadfast heart he obeys the voice of his commander; he trusts to
  his good ship, and 'laughs at the storm and the battle.'</p>

  <p>But how differently does he feel, when roused from his deep
  slumber by the cry of fire. He rushes upon deck, but half awake,
  to meet an enemy far more terrible than <a name="Page_37" id=
  "Page_37"></a>any he has yet encountered. He finds himself
  enveloped in a suffocating smoke&mdash;here and there gleams a
  lurid flame&mdash;the fire becomes gradually more vivid: it rises
  higher and higher; grows brighter and brighter. In vain he looks
  for help,&mdash;beneath, nothing meets his eye but the boundless
  waste of waters, that can avail so little to quench those flames;
  above, the pathless fields of air, that serve but to increase
  their fury. The insidious enemy quietly but surely creeps onward,
  and the sailor knows but too well, that if not speedily arrested,
  the flames must reach the powder magazine, and then a few
  smouldering fragments strewed upon the waters will alone remain
  of the gallant ship and her living freight.</p>

  <p>Such was the hideous form in which death presented itself to
  the minds of the crew of the Queen Charlotte, who now anxiously
  turned their eyes to their captain and officers, in the hope
  that, as on former occasions, their example and assistance might
  enable them to avert the threatened danger. Nor was their
  confidence misplaced.</p>

  <p>Captain Todd and his first lieutenant (Mr. Bainbridge) stood
  upon the quarter-deck, displaying a calmness and self-possession
  of which the effects were soon felt throughout the vessel, and
  restored order among the ship's company.</p>

  <p>They went among the people, calming their fears, and
  encouraging them to increased exertion, neither of them seeming
  for a moment to think of his own safety in comparison with that
  of his companions in danger.</p>

  <p>All that man could do in such a case was done; but human
  foresight and presence of mind were of no avail against the
  irresistible power of that relentless enemy.</p>

  <p>The flames darted up the mainmast, reached the boats upon the
  boom, and now wrapped in wreathing fires the <a name="Page_38"
  id="Page_38"></a>whole of the quarter-deck, from whence all had
  been driven save the captain and first lieutenant, who still
  nobly kept their posts.</p>

  <p>Amongst those who more particularly distinguished themselves
  on this occasion (where all did their duty) was Lieutenant the
  Hon. G.H.L. Dundas. This officer was roused from his sleep by the
  sentinel announcing to him that the ship was on fire. Springing
  from his cot, he hastily put on some clothes and attempted to
  ascend the after hatchway, but was driven back by the smoke. He
  then went to the main hatchway, and had almost reached the top of
  the ladder, when he was so overpowered, that he fell exhausted
  upon the middle deck.</p>

  <p>When he had in some degree recovered, he rushed to the fore
  hatchway and thence to the forecastle, where he found the first
  lieutenant, some petty officers, and the greater part of the
  ship's company. These were endeavouring to haul up the mainsail
  which was in flames. The carpenter, seeing Lieutenant Dundas,
  suggested that he might direct some of the men to sluice the
  lower decks, and secure the hatchways, to prevent the fire
  reaching that part of the ship.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dundas collected about seventy men, who volunteered to
  accompany him, and descended to the lower decks. The ports were
  opened, the cocks turned, and water thrown upon the decks. All
  the hammocks were cleared away, and as many people as could be
  spared were employed in heaving water upon the burning wood,
  rigging, and spars, which kept falling down the hatchways. The
  gratings were fastened down and covered over with wet blankets
  and hammocks. In this way the lower deck was kept free from fire
  for some time, until at length it broke out in both of the
  transom cabins, and burnt forward with great rapidity. Mr. Dundas
  and <a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>his party did not leave
  that part of ship, till several of the middle guns came through
  the deck.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock, finding it impossible to remain longer below,
  he got out of one of the starboard lower deck ports, and reached
  the forecastle, followed by most of the officers and men who had
  been with him. On the forecastle, about 250 men were drawing
  water, and throwing it upon the fire as far aft as possible.</p>

  <p>For nearly four hours every exertion was made to subdue the
  flames. Officers and men behaved with heroic courage and
  self-possession; but in spite of their almost superhuman efforts,
  the flames rolled on, and the destruction of the ship became
  inevitable.</p>

  <div class="poem">

  </div>

  <p>And many of that gallant company verified the poet's
  description: almost maddened by the intense heat, they sprung
  overboard and perished.</p>

  <p>Lieut. Archibald Duff, who had been alarmed by the firing of
  guns, attempted to get out of the ward-room door, but was driven
  back by the smoke. He at last succeeded in scrambling out of the
  quarter gallery, and reached the poop, from whence he jumped into
  the sea, and was picked up by the launch, when in the act of
  casting off the tow-rope. He had hardly left the ship when the
  mizenmast fell over the side, by which great numbers were thrown
  into the water, and left struggling in the waves; for, as the
  launch had only one oar, and <a name="Page_40" id=
  "Page_40"></a>neither sail nor mast, she drifted much faster than
  the men could swim, and many, whom those on board her would
  gladly have saved, perished within a few feet of the boat.</p>

  <p>At length a ray of hope dawned upon the anxious survivors:
  vessels and boats were seen coming towards them from Leghorn; and
  as they neared the ship, every heart beat quicker, and every hand
  was nerved with increased strength. But the boats' crews, alarmed
  by the explosion of the guns, which were most of them shotted,
  refused to approach nearer, and hove to. Seeing their hesitation,
  the crew of the Queen Charlotte gave them three cheers to
  encourage them. The English cheers seemed to have the desired
  effect, for again the boats pulled towards the hapless vessel;
  but it was afterwards discovered that this renewed activity was
  entirely owing to the persuasions of Lieut. Stewart and other
  English officers who were in the boats.</p>

  <p>Lord Keith, who was watching with intense anxiety the
  destruction of his noble ship, used every possible effort to
  induce the Tuscans to put to sea; but his entreaties, backed as
  they were by the commands of the governor and other authorities,
  had no influence save with a few only, and even these, when they
  did venture to the rescue, were with great difficulty prevailed
  upon to approach the vessel. A boat from an American ship
  presented a striking contrast. She was manned by three men only,
  who, in their generous ardour to save the lives of their
  fellow-creatures, came alongside too incautiously, so that the
  wretched sufferers from the burning deck leaped into the boat in
  such numbers that she capsized, and every one of them perished.
  The fire had now advanced so rapidly that it was impossible to
  bear the heat on the forecastle, and most of the people got on to
  the bowsprit and jib-boom. The latter, however, gave way under
  the <a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>pressure, and numbers were
  precipitated into the water and drowned.</p>

  <p>The boats, headed by Lieutenant Stewart, approached about ten
  o'clock, and the people continued dropping into them from the
  ship for some time. Captain Todd and Mr. Bainbridge continued to
  the last to give orders for the safety of those who remained
  alive.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Duff gives the following account of the closing
  scene:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Lieutenant Stewart's ardour in the cause of humanity was only
  equalled by his judgment in affording relief. When he reached the
  Queen Charlotte, he dropped his tartane under the bows, where
  almost all the remaining crew had taken refuge. Little more than
  an hour had elapsed, after this assistance was given, before the
  ship blew up. All that had been left unburnt immediately sunk
  down by the stern, but when the ponderous contents of the hold
  had been washed away, she for an instant recovered her buoyancy,
  and was suddenly seen to emerge almost her whole length from the
  deep, and then, turning over, she floated on the surface, with
  her burnished copper glistening in the sun.'</p>

  <p>Such was the fate of the Queen Charlotte, which, excepting the
  Ville de Paris, was the largest ship in the British navy.</p>

  <p>With the gallant vessel perished six hundred and seventy-three
  of her men and officers; amongst whom were Captain Todd and
  Lieutenant Bainbridge. These two officers, with heroic
  self-devotion, remained to share the fate of their ship, occupied
  to the last in endeavouring to save the lives of the men.</p>

  <p>Before Captain Todd fell a victim to the flames, he had the
  presence of mind to write the particulars of the melancholy
  event, and to give copies of his account to <a name="Page_42" id=
  "Page_42"></a>several of the sailors, charging them to deliver it
  to the admiral if they should be so fortunate as to
  escape.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>The following daring exploit is related of Lieutenant
  Bainbridge in James's <i>Naval History</i>. We transcribe it as
  affording a striking example of the union of undaunted courage
  with endurance in the character of a British sailor.</p>

  <p>"On the evening of the 21st of December, the British hired 10
  gun cutter, Lady Nelson, while off Carbareta Point, was
  surrounded and engaged by two or three French privateers, and
  some gun vessels, in sight of the 100 gun ship, Queen Charlotte,
  and the 36 gun frigate Emerald, lying in Gibraltar Bay.
  Vice-Admiral Lord Keith, whose flag was flying on board the
  former ship, immediately ordered the boats of the two to row
  towards the combatants, in the hope that it might encourage the
  Lady Nelson to resist, until she could approach near enough to be
  covered by the guns of the ships. Before the boats could get up,
  however, the Lady Nelson had been captured, and was in tow by two
  of the privateers.</p>

  <p>"Notwithstanding this, Lieutenant Bainbridge, in the Queen
  Charlotte's barge, with sixteen men, ran alongside, and boarded
  with the greatest impetuosity; and after a sharp conflict,
  carried the Lady Nelson, taking as prisoners seven French
  officers and twenty-seven men.&mdash;six or seven others having
  been killed or knocked overboard in the scuffle. Lieutenant
  Bainbridge was severely wounded in the head by the stroke of a
  sabre, and slightly in other places."</p>

  <p>We have seen how, a few months afterwards, this brave officer
  patiently anticipated death in a more terrible form on board the
  Queen Charlotte.</p>

  "Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>THE INVINCIBLE.</h2>

  <p>The Invincible, of 74 guns, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral
  Totty, and commanded by Captain Rennie, sailed from Yarmouth on
  the morning of the 16th of March, 1801, to join the fleet of
  Admiral Sir Hyde Parker in the Baltic.</p>

  <p>The master and the pilot were both considered very skilful
  mariners of those seas, and their orders were to navigate the
  ship into the North Sea, and to put her in the way of joining the
  fleet to the northward, as soon as she had cleared all the
  shoals.</p>

  <p>About half-past two o'clock, P.M., of the same day, the
  Invincible, going at the rate of nine knots an hour, struck
  violently upon a sand-bank, and before the sails could be furled,
  she was fast aground in little more than three fathoms water.</p>

  <p>The pilot and master assured Captain Rennie that there was no
  danger, and that the ship must have struck upon a lately formed
  knowl. In order to lighten her as much as possible, the yards and
  topmasts were struck, and some of the provisions thrown
  overboard, and then strong hopes were entertained that she would
  float off the bank with the next tide.</p>

  <p>During this time she lay tolerably quiet, and the water gained
  but little upon the pumps. Every means was used to draw the
  attention of vessels passing near&mdash;guns were fired, and
  signals hoisted; but they remained unanswered until about five
  o'clock, P.M., when a cutter was observed scudding towards
  Yarmouth Roads, as if to inform Admiral Dickson of the situation
  of the Invincible. As the ship remained easy, neither the
  officers nor men suspected that the danger was imminent, and
  <a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>they performed their duty with
  the same regularity as if the ship were proceeding under ordinary
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>All went on well until about half-past five, P.M., when the
  wind freshened, and the vessel began to beat the ground with such
  violence, that it was thought necessary to cut away the masts.
  The ship at this time dropped from three and a half into
  seventeen fathoms. She was then brought to with her bower anchor,
  and there appeared every probability of her getting safely off
  till about nine o'clock, when the flood-tide was making; she then
  lost her rudder, became unmanageable, and was driven back upon
  the rock.</p>

  <p>Fortunately a fishing-smack had come near the Invincible a
  short time before, and Admiral Totty learnt from her master that
  the ship had struck upon Hammond's knowl; whereupon the admiral
  requested that the smack might be anchored as near as possible,
  so as to be ready in case of emergency.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the ship continued to strike with increasing
  violence, and the water gained considerably upon the pumps. At
  ten o'clock, the wind rose, and again the ship swung off into
  deep water, and the only prospect of saving her was by pumping
  and baling till daylight. Both officers and men laboured
  incessantly at the pumps, but all to no purpose, for
  unfortunately the Invincible was an old ship (built in the year
  1766), and the water gained fast upon them in spite of all their
  efforts. Admiral Totty, seeing there was no hope of saving the
  ship, ordered Captain Rennie to send all the boys, and the least
  able of the crew and passengers, on board the smack, and to make
  arrangements for the rest of the crew to leave the ship at
  daybreak, or sooner, if possible.</p>

  <p>A boat was lowered, into which the admiral and his secretary
  immediately descended, with as many others as she would carry,
  and they reached the smack in safety. <a name="Page_45" id=
  "Page_45"></a>Two other boats were also lowered and filled with
  people, but they were less fortunate than the admiral's, for
  before they reached the smack, the tide being to windward and
  against them, they were carried out to sea, and all on board
  would inevitably have perished, if they had not been picked up by
  a collier, which conveyed them in safety to Yarmouth.</p>

  <p>The fishing-smack, with the admiral on board, remained at
  anchor during the night, without being able to afford the
  slightest assistance to the crew of the Invincible. At daybreak,
  as soon as the tide permitted, the cable of the smack was cut,
  and she stretched under the stern of the ship, endeavouring by
  all possible means to get alongside of her, but before that could
  be accomplished, the ill-fated vessel began to sink. About sixty
  men jumped into the launch, but they had only just time to clear
  the poop, when the gallant ship went down with four hundred
  men.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span>And first one universal shriek there rush'd,<br /></span>
      <span class="i2">Louder than the loud ocean, like a crash<br /></span>

      <span>Of billows: but at intervals there gushed,<br /></span>
      <span class="i2">Accompanied with a convulsive splash,<br /></span>
      <span>A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry<br /></span>
      <span class="i2">Of some strong swimmer in his agony.<br /></span>
      <span class="i16">LORD BYRON.<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>'The horror of the scene,' writes Admiral Totty, 'and the
  screams of the unhappy sufferers, at the moment the ship went
  down, exceed all power of description. Numbers who were
  struggling with the waves attempted to lay hold of the launch,
  but the boat was already overladen, and, for the safety of those
  who were in her, the drowning wretches were beaten off, and, soon
  exhausted, they perished in the waves.'</p>

  <p><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>Captain Rennie remained in
  his ship till she sank. He then attempted to swim to the launch,
  and by great exertion got within reach of her oars, when, too
  much exhausted to make any further effort, he was seen to raise
  his hands as if in supplication to Heaven, then putting them
  before his face, sank into his watery grave. All the other
  commissioned officers, with the exception of Lieutenants Robert
  Tucker and Charles Quart, perished.</p>

  <p>Captain Rennie had distinguished himself, when a lieutenant,
  at the Helder; and Admiral Mitchell had mentioned him in such
  high terms of commendation in his public despatches, that he was
  made a post-captain. After remaining for some time unemployed, he
  was appointed to the Invincible, and proud of his first command,
  full of life and hope, he had just put to sea when this
  melancholy catastrophe closed a career that held out such bright
  prospects for the future.</p>

  <p>We must not be supposed to have more feeling for an officer
  than for the men before the mast. If we dwell with peculiar
  sorrow upon the loss of a brave commander, like Captain Rennie,
  it is not that we are indifferent to the fate of the four hundred
  gallant men who perished with him; but there is something in
  human nature that compels even the most generous spirit to speak
  more of the loss of a man in a responsible station than others;
  and one reason for this may be, that our hopes under God, for the
  safety of our fleets and our armies, rest on our brave and
  efficient commanders.</p>

  <p>No one can read such records of British seamen, as appear in
  this volume, without joining heart and soul in the sentiment

  <p>Lieutenant Robert Tucker, who was saved in the launch,
  accompanied Rear-Admiral Totty to the Baltic and West Indies in
  the Zealous, 74. He was subsequently promoted, and appointed to
  the Surinam in 1803.</p>

  <p>Whilst the Surinam was on the West India station, Captain
  Tucker rendered good service to the French garrison at Jacquemel;
  and on returning from thence, his ship sprung her foremast, and
  was in other respects so much damaged, that he was obliged to put
  in at Cura&ccedil;oa. Whilst refitting, he received private
  information that Great Britain and Holland would ere long be
  declared enemies. He therefore made every effort to hasten his
  departure, and get his ship ready for sea; and he had warped her
  to the head of the harbour, when a prize schooner which he had
  despatched to Commodore Hood returned from that officer, with
  orders for his future guidance. The officer on board the schooner
  incautiously permitted his vessel to touch at the government
  wharf, when some of the crew, having the opportunity imprudently
  afforded them, jumped on shore, and reported that the British had
  already commenced hostilities.</p>

  <p>Upon this the Surinam was detained, and Captain Tucker was
  ordered on shore, and informed that he must consider himself a
  prisoner of war. At first he was not put under strict
  surveillance, and he therefore employed the weary hours in taking
  plans of the forts and batteries of the island. His occupation,
  however, was soon discovered, and highly disapproved by the
  authorities, <a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>who immediately
  placed him in close confinement in a room of the barracks.</p>

  <p>On the first night of his captivity two musket-balls were
  fired into his room, one of which struck a table at which he had
  been seated a few moments before. These murderous attempts were
  frequently repeated during his imprisonment, and he must
  inevitably have been shot in his bed, had he not taken the
  precaution of constantly moving its position, and thus baffled
  the treacherous designs of his cowardly assailants.</p>

  <p>A friendly warning was given to him, that where bullets
  failed, <i>poison</i> might succeed; and he was thenceforth
  obliged to watch most narrowly, lest it should be administered in
  his food. In this wretched state of suspense, he lingered for
  four months, when happily he and his officers were released in
  exchange for nine Dutch clergymen.</p>

  <p>We regret that our pen should have to record such treachery as
  that we have described. We ask, and others have asked, were these
  soldiers and gaolers free men and Christians, or were they slaves
  and heathens? It must, however, be remembered that politics ran
  very high at that time; and in this particular instance, at the
  outbreak of a war, men's minds were half frantic, and we must not
  judge of the character of a nation by the isolated acts of a
  petty colonial government.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_GRAPPLER" id="THE_GRAPPLER"></a><a name=
  "Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>THE GRAPPLER.</h2>

  <p>CHAUSSEY, or Choy&eacute;, is a group of islets lying off the
  coast of Normandy, about twenty miles from Jersey, and nine from
  Granville. They stretch north, east, and west, and cover a space
  of nearly twelve miles. The principal of them is called the
  Maitre Isle, and is the resort of a few French fishermen during
  the summer, but being only a rock, and totally devoid of
  vegetation, its inhabitants are entirely dependent on the
  neighbouring shores for all the necessaries of life, excepting
  what their nets may produce. At the time of which we are writing,
  the winter of 1803, this group of islets was in the hands of the
  English, and was the scene of the wreck of the Grappler in that
  year.</p>

  <p>On the 23rd December, 1803, Lieutenant Abel Thomas, commanding
  His Majesty's brig Grappler, then stationed at Guernsey, was
  directed by Admiral Sir James Saumarez to proceed, with some
  French prisoners on board, to Granville, in Normandy, and there
  to set them at liberty; after which he was to touch at the
  islands of Chaussey, on his return to Guernsey, in order to
  supply twelve French prisoners who were on the Maitre Isle with
  fifteen days' provisions.</p>

  <p>On the evening of the 23rd,&mdash;the same day that they
  sailed from Guernsey,&mdash;the Grappler anchored off the north
  side of Chaussey, but a heavy gale of wind which came on during
  the night rendered her position so dangerous, that Lieutenant
  Thomas thought it advisable either to return to Guernsey, or to
  run into one of the small harbours formed among the rocks, which
  afford a safe shelter during the severest gales, but are by no
  means easy of access, and are available only to small <a name=
  "Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>vessels, and with the aid of an
  experienced pilot. Into one of these natural harbours, Lieutenant
  Thomas, by the advice of his pilot, determined to run the
  Grappler, and succeeded in anchoring her in safety under the
  Maitre Isle. There they remained four or five days, keeping a
  sharp look-out by day from the top of one of the adjacent rocks,
  to guard against a surprise from the enemy's cruizers; while for
  their better security at night, a guard-boat was stationed at the
  entrance of the harbour. As the weather still continued too
  boisterous to trust the brig with safety on a lee shore, her
  commander determined to return to Guernsey, and offered his
  prisoners the alternative of returning with him, or remaining
  with their countrymen at Chaussey. As they all chose to remain,
  they were promptly landed, and furnished with a boat and a week's
  supply of provisions, in addition to what had already been left
  for the use of the inhabitants. To enable his prisoners to land
  with greater security at Granville, Lieutenant Thomas read aloud
  and sealed in their presence a letter, addressed by Sir James
  Saumarez to the Commissary of Marine at that port, containing an
  explanation of his reasons for liberating these
  Frenchmen,&mdash;with his hopes that the French authorities would
  act in the same manner towards any English who might fall into
  their hands,&mdash;and entrusted it to one of them, with another
  letter from himself, in which he stated how he had been prevented
  from conveying them to Granville in his own vessel, and begged
  that any English prisoners who chanced to be at that place might
  be sent to one of the Channel Islands. The sequel will show in
  what manner this courtesy and generosity were repaid by the
  French government.</p>

  <p>At six, A.M., December 30th, all was in readiness for the
  Grappler to leave the harbour. The anchor was up, and the vessel
  was riding between wind and tide, with a hawser <a name="Page_51"
  id="Page_51"></a>made fast to the rocks. Unfortunately, the
  hawser either broke or slipped while they were in the act of
  close reefing the topsails, and the brig cast to port. She
  drifted about three or four hundred yards, and struck at last on
  a half-tide rock, from which all their efforts were unavailing to
  haul her off again, and at low water she bilged, and parted in
  two abreast the chess tree.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Thomas, foreseeing the inevitable loss of the brig,
  had ordered the master to proceed with the cutter and eight men
  to Jersey for assistance; and he was directing the crew in their
  endeavours to mount some guns upon a small rocky islet, to which
  they had already carried the greater part of the provisions,
  small arms, and ammunition, when the look-out man, who had been
  stationed on the summit of the rock, reported that several small
  craft were steering towards them. Upon receiving this
  intelligence, the commander and pilot repaired to the high
  ground, and after carefully examining the appearance of the
  vessels, agreed that they were merely fishing boats, and
  considered that it would be imprudent to let them depart before
  assistance had been procured from Jersey, as, in case there were
  no ships of war at that place, these boats might possibly be
  hired to carry the men and stores to Jersey. With this object in
  view, Lieutenant Thomas pushed off in the jolly boat, accompanied
  by the French fishermen's small boat which had come to the
  assistance of the Grappler's crew.</p>

  <p>In order to approach the supposed fishing boats, it was
  necessary to double a point of the Maitre Isle; and this they had
  no sooner accomplished, than they came in sight of three chasse
  mar&eacute;es, which had been concealed behind the point. On the
  sudden appearance of the English boat, the men on board the
  chasse mar&eacute;es were thrown into some confusion, and
  Lieutenant Thomas <a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>determined
  to attack them before they had time to recover themselves. On
  communicating his intention to his boat's crew, they dashed
  forwards at once with a loud cheer, but had scarcely pulled a
  dozen strokes when a body of soldiers, who had been concealed
  behind some rocks on the Maitre Isle, poured in so severe a fire
  that Lieutenant Thomas, seeing the superiority of the French in
  point of numbers, thought it prudent to retreat. No sooner had he
  given orders to do so, than a shot struck him on the lower jaw
  and passed through his tongue, rendering him incapable of further
  exertion. A second volley of musketry riddled the boat, so that
  she began to fill with water, and finding that they had no
  alternative but to surrender, the English made a signal to that
  effect, which was either unobserved, or purposely disregarded, as
  the firing did not cease till the arrival of the officer in
  command of the French, when the little party were all made
  prisoners. Upon Lieutenant Thomas being carried on shore, he
  found that he had fallen into the hands of a Capitaine de
  Frigate, who commanded a detachment of fourteen boats and a
  hundred and sixty men. As soon as the captives were landed, a
  party of the French troops proceeded to the wreck of the
  Grappler, and made prisoners of the men who were on the adjacent
  rock, and after seizing all the stores and provisions, they blew
  up the remains of the brig.</p>

  <p>When Lieutenant Thomas had partially recovered from the
  faintness and insensibility caused by his wound, he handed his
  pocket-book to the French officer. After reading the orders of
  Sir James Saumarez, which it contained, this officer expressed
  much regret that Lieutenant Thomas had been so seriously wounded,
  and alleged that the troops had fired without his orders. Such
  was the apology of the French commander, but it certainly does
  not tell well for the discipline of his troops, nor is it easy
  <a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>to understand how so large a
  body of men could be left without a commissioned officer even for
  a moment, much less how they could have kept up a continued fire,
  which this seems to have been. Perhaps, however, it is not fair
  to comment too severely upon the conduct of the French on this
  occasion; the signal of surrender might not have been observed,
  and as the English had commenced the attack, the enemy may
  naturally have supposed that a larger force was shortly advancing
  to the support of their comrades. We should also bear in mind
  that the war had just broke out anew, after a short cessation of
  hostilities, and that national animosity was at its height.</p>

  <p>Thus far we may attempt to palliate the conduct of the French,
  but it might naturally be supposed that upon learning from his
  papers the errand of mercy upon which Lieutenant Thomas had been
  engaged, the French officer would have done all in his power to
  alleviate the sufferings of his prisoner, and have shown him
  every mark of courtesy and attention. However this may be, no
  sooner were all arrangements completed, than the prisoners were
  marched to the boats, and Lieutenant Thomas was handed over to
  the care of two grenadiers, with directions that every attention
  should be paid to him; but the officer's back was scarcely
  turned, when these grenadiers, assisted by some of their
  comrades, stripped poor Thomas of all his clothes, broke open his
  trunk, which had been restored to him, and appropriated to
  themselves every article of value that he possessed. Having
  secured their plunder, they dragged their unfortunate victim to
  the beach, regardless of his wound and sufferings, and after
  gagging him with a pocket-handkerchief, threw him on the deck of
  one of their boats.</p>

  <p>The wind blowing fresh on their passage to Granville, <a name=
  "Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>which was three leagues from Chaussey,
  the greater part of the soldiers were prostrated by sea-sickness,
  whilst the seamen were in such a state of intoxication, that had
  Lieutenant Thomas been able to rise, or to communicate with his
  fellow-prisoners, he might easily have overpowered the French,
  and gained possession of the vessel. If such an idea flashed
  across his mind, it was but for a moment: he could neither speak
  nor move, and lay for many hours exposed to the insulting jeers
  of the French, and the inclemency of the weather. It was late at
  night when they landed at Granville, but the naval and military
  staff waited upon Mr. Thomas the next morning, and told him that
  it was the intention of the authorities to send him back to
  England, in consideration of his kindness to the French
  prisoners. The expectation raised in the English officer's breast
  by these promises were, to the disgrace of the French government
  of that day, never realized. He was thrown into prison, and
  treated with the utmost severity; in vain did he protest against
  this injustice&mdash;in vain did he represent that he was engaged
  on no hostile expedition at the time of his capture, which,
  moreover, was not through the fortune of war, but through the
  violence of the elements. He was kept in close confinement at
  Verdun for ten years, and when he was at last released, liberty
  was scarcely a boon to him. The damp of his prison, and the
  sufferings attendant on his wound, had impaired his eyesight, and
  otherwise so injured his constitution, that he was no longer fit
  for active service. He was, however, promoted to the rank of
  commander immediately on his return to England: this rank he
  still holds, but the best years of his life had been spent in
  captivity, and his hopes of promotion were not realized till too
  late for the enjoyment of its honours, or for the service of his
  country.</p>

  id="Page_55"></a>THE APOLLO.</h2>

  <p>The following account of the loss of the Apollo is taken
  almost verbatim from the narrative of Mr. Lewis, clerk of the
  ship, an eye-witness of the occurrence. His narrative is too
  graphic to be suppressed:&mdash;'On Monday, the 26th of March,
  1804, His Majesty's ship Apollo sailed from the Cove of Cork in
  company with the Carysfort, and sixty-nine sail of merchantmen
  under convoy, for the West Indies. On the 27th, we were out of
  sight of land, with a fair wind blowing fresh from the
  west-south-west. At eight o'clock on the evening of Sunday, the
  1st of April, the wind shifted from south-west to south-east. At
  ten o'clock, we up mainsail and set mainstay-sail. At a quarter
  past ten, the mainstay-sail split by the sheet giving way. All
  hands were called upon deck. It blew strong and squally; we took
  in the foretop-sail and set the foresail. At half-past eleven the
  maintop-sail split; furled it and the mainsail. The ship was now
  under her foresails, the wind blowing hard, with a heavy sea.</p>

  <p>'At about half-past three on Monday morning, April 2nd, the
  ship struck the ground, to the astonishment of every one on
  board, and by the last reckoning, we conjectured we were upon an
  unknown shoal.</p>

  <p>'The vessel struck very heavily several times, by which her
  bottom was materially injured, and she made a great deal of
  water. The chain pumps were rigged with the utmost despatch, and
  the men began to pump, but in about ten minutes she beat and
  drove over the shoal, and on endeavouring to steer her, they
  found her rudder was carried away. The ship was then got before
  the <a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>wind, the pumps were kept
  going, but from the quantity of water shipped, there was every
  probability of her soon foundering, as she was filling and
  sinking very fast.</p>

  <p>'After running about five minutes, the ship struck the ground
  again with such violent shocks, that we feared she would go to
  pieces instantly; however, she kept striking and driving further
  on the sands, the sea washing completely over her. Orders were
  given to cut away the lanyards of the main and mizen rigging,
  when the masts fell with a tremendous crash over the
  larboard-side: the foremast followed immediately after. The ship
  then fell on her starboard-side, with the gunwale under water.
  The violence with which she struck the ground and the weight of
  the guns (those on the quarter-deck tearing away the bulwarks)
  soon made the ship a perfect wreck abaft, and only four or five
  guns could possibly be fired to alarm the convoy and give notice
  of danger.</p>

  <p>'On her drifting a second time, most pitiful cries were heard
  everywhere between decks; many of the men giving themselves up to
  inevitable death. I was told that I might as well stay below, as
  there was an equal likelihood of perishing if I got upon deck. I
  was, however, determined to go&mdash;and attempted, in the first
  place, to enter my cabin, but I was in danger of having my legs
  broken by the chests floating about, and the bulkheads giving
  way.</p>

  <p>'I therefore desisted and endeavoured to get upon deck, which I
  effected after being several times washed down the hatchway by
  the immense body of water incessantly pouring down. As the ship
  still beat the ground very heavily, it was necessary to cling
  fast to some part of the wreck to save oneself from being washed
  away by the surges, or hurled overboard by the concussions. The
  people held on by the larboard bulwark of the quarter-deck and in
  <a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>the main chains. The good
  captain stood naked upon the cabin skylight grating, making use
  of every soothing expression that suggested itself&mdash;to
  encourage men in such a perilous situation. Most of the officers
  and men were entirety naked, not having had time to slip on even
  a pair of trousers.</p>

  <p>'Our horrible situation became every moment more dreadful,
  until at daybreak, about half-past four o'clock, we discerned
  land at two cables' distance, a long sandy beach reaching to Cape
  Mondego, three leagues to the southward of us. On daylight
  clearing up, we could perceive between twenty and thirty sail of
  the convoy ashore, both to northward and southward, and several
  of them perfect wrecks. We were now certain of being on the coast
  of Portugal, from seeing the cape mentioned above,&mdash;though I
  am sorry to say no person in the ship had the least idea of being
  so near the coast. It was blowing very hard, and the sea was
  running mountains high, so that there was little hope of being
  saved. About eight o'clock, the ship seemed likely to go to
  pieces, and the after part lying lowest, Captain Dixon ordered
  every one forward,&mdash;a command it was difficult to comply
  with, from the motion of the mainmast working on the larboard
  gunwale, there being no other way to get forward. Mr. Cook, the
  boatswain, had his thigh broken in endeavouring to get a boat
  over the side. Of six boats not one was saved, all being stoved,
  and washed overboard with the booms, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>'Soon after the people got forward, the ship parted at the
  gangways. The crew were now obliged to stow themselves in the
  fore-channels, and from thence to the bowsprit end, to the number
  of 220,&mdash;for, out of the 240 persons on board when the ship
  first struck, I suppose twenty to have previously perished
  between <a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>decks and otherwise.
  Mr. Lawton, the gunner, the first who attempted to swim ashore,
  was drowned; afterwards, Lieutenant Witson, Mr. Runice, surgeon,
  Mr. McCabe, surgeon's mate, Mr. Staudley, master's mate, and
  several men, were also drowned (though they were excellent
  swimmers), by the sea breaking over them in enormous surges.
  About thirty persons had the good fortune to reach the shore upon
  planks and spars, amongst whom were Lieutenant Harvey and Mr.
  Callam, master's mate. On Monday night, our situation was truly
  horrible; the old men and boys were dying from hunger and
  fatigue; Messrs. Proby and Hayes, midshipmen, died also. Captain
  Dixon remained all night upon the bowsprit.</p>

  <p>'Tuesday morning presented no better prospect of relief from
  the jaws of death. The wind blew stronger, and the sea was much
  more turbulent. About noon, our drooping spirits were somewhat
  revived by seeing Lieutenant Harvey and Mr. Callam hoisting out a
  boat from one of the merchant ships to come to our assistance.
  They attempted several times to launch her through the surf; but
  she was a very heavy boat, and the sea on the beach acted so
  powerfully against them, they could not effect their purpose,
  though they were assisted by nearly one hundred of the merchant
  sailors and Portuguese peasants. This day, several men went upon
  rafts made from pieces of the wreck; but not one reached the
  shore: the wind having shifted, and the current setting
  <i>out</i>, they were all driven to sea, and amongst them our
  captain and three sailors. Anxious to save the remainder of the
  ship's company, and too sanguine of getting safe on shore, he had
  ventured upon the spar, saying, as he jumped into the sea, 'My
  lads, I'll save you all.' In a few seconds, he lost his hold of
  the spar, which he could not regain: he drifted to sea, and
  perished: and such <a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>was also
  the fate of the three brave volunteers who shared his
  fortune.</p>

  <p>'The loss of our captain, who had hitherto animated the almost
  lifeless crew, and the failure of Lieutenant Harvey and Mr.
  Callam, in their noble exertions to launch the boat, extinguished
  every gleam of hope, and we looked forward to certain death on
  the ensuing night, not only from cold, hunger, and fatigue, but
  from the expectation that the remaining part of the wreck might
  go to pieces at any moment. Had not the Apollo been a new and
  well-built ship, that small portion of her could not have
  resisted the waves, and held so well together, when all the
  after-part from the chess-tree was gone, the starboard bow under
  water, and the forecastle deck nearly perpendicular. The weight
  of the guns hanging to the larboard bulwark on the inside, and on
  the outside the bower and spare anchors, which it was not prudent
  to cut away, as they afforded a resting-place to a considerable
  number of men, added to the danger. It had become impossible to
  remain any longer in the head, or upon the bowsprit, the breakers
  washing continually over those places, so that one hundred and
  fifty men were stowed in the fore-channels and cat's-head, where
  alone it was possible to live.</p>

  <p>'The night drawing on, the wind increasing, with frequent
  showers of rain, the sea washing over us, and the expectation
  becoming every instant more certain, that the forecastle would
  give way and that we must all perish together, afforded a
  spectacle truly deplorable, and the bare recollection of which
  makes me shudder. The piercing cries of the people, this dismal
  night, as the sea washed over them every two minutes, were
  pitiful in the extreme. The water running from the head down over
  the body kept us continually wet. On that fearful night <a name=
  "Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>every man's strength was exerted for
  his own individual safety. From crowding so close together in so
  narrow a compass, and having nothing to moisten their mouths,
  several poor wretches were suffocated, like those in the black
  hole,&mdash;with this only difference, that we were confined by
  water instead of strong walls; and the least movement or
  relaxation of our hold would have plunged us into eternity.</p>

  <p>'Some unfortunate men drank salt water, several endeavoured to
  quench their raging thirst by a still more unnatural means; some
  chewed leather, myself and many others thought we experienced
  great relief by chewing lead, as it produced saliva.</p>

  <p>'In less than an hour after the ship had struck the ground,
  all the provisions were under water, and the ship a wreck, so
  that we were entirely without food. After a night of most intense
  suffering, daylight enabled us to see Lieutenant Harvey and Mr.
  Callam again endeavouring to launch the boat. Several attempts
  were made without success, and a number of men belonging to the
  merchant ships were much bruised and injured in their efforts to
  assist. Alternate hopes and fears possessed our wretched
  minds.</p>

  <p>'Fifteen men got safe on shore, this morning, on pieces of the
  wreck. About three, P.M., of Wednesday, the 4th, we had the
  inexpressible happiness of seeing the boat launched through the
  surf, by the indefatigable exertions of the two officers,
  assisted by the masters of the merchant ships, and a number of
  Portuguese peasants, who were encouraged by Mr. Whitney, the
  British Consul from Figuera.</p>

  <p>'All the crew then remaining on the wreck were brought safe on
  shore, praising God for this happy deliverance, from a shipwreck
  which never yet had its parallel.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>'As soon as I slipt out of
  the boat, I found several persons whose humanity prompted them to
  offer me refreshment, though imprudently, in the form of spirits,
  which I avoided as much as possible.</p>

  <p>'Our weak state may be conceived when it is remembered that we
  had tasted no nourishment from Sunday to Wednesday afternoon, and
  had been exposed all that time to the fury, of the elements.
  After eating and drinking a little, I found myself weaker than
  before, owing, I imagine, to having been so long without food.
  Some men died soon after getting on shore, from taking too large
  a quantity of spirits. The whole of the crew were in a very weak
  and exhausted state, and the greater part of them were also
  severely bruised and wounded.'</p>

  <p>Such is Mr. Lewis's account of the wreck of the Apollo, one of
  our finest frigates, and the loss of sixty of her men.</p>

  <p>The cause of this catastrophe seems to have been an error in
  the reckoning. At twelve o'clock on Sunday, the land was supposed
  to be thirty or forty leagues distant, nor were they aware of
  their true position when the vessel struck at three o'clock the
  following morning, on what was supposed to be an unknown shoal.
  Never, perhaps, in the annals of maritime disaster, was there a
  scene more rife with horror than that upon which the daylight
  broke on the morning of the 2nd of April.</p>

  <p>The frigate, which but a few hours before had been careering
  on her way with her gallant company full of life and energy, now
  lay a hapless wreck&mdash;her timbers crashing beneath the fury
  of the waves. The merchant vessels around were stranded in all
  directions, and the air resounded with the despairing shrieks of
  those on board. The destruction of the Apollo seemed inevitable;
  but in this hour of trial, the captain was firm and resolute,
  sustaining by words and example the courage of <a name="Page_62"
  id="Page_62"></a>his crew; and when no other means of escape
  presented themselves, he sacrificed his own life in the endeavour
  to obtain rescue for those under his charge.</p>

  <p>The narrator of this sad tale, has touchingly described in no
  exaggerated terms the sufferings of the wretched crowd who were
  exposed for nearly three days and nights to the worst of physical
  and mental evils&mdash;hunger, thirst, cold, and
  nakedness&mdash;in their most aggravated form, rendered still
  more painful by the almost utter hopelessness of their condition,
  while they watched the repeated failures of Lieutenant Harvey and
  Mr. Callam in their attempts to send a boat to their relief. We
  need not therefore dwell on this subject further than to observe
  that, under Providence, it was by the undaunted courage and
  perseverance of those two officers that the remainder of the crew
  of the Apollo were saved from destruction&mdash;for no one else
  had been found bold enough to attempt their rescue, although the
  Consul of Figuera had offered 100 guineas to any man that would
  take a boat to the wreck.</p>

  <p>No less than forty merchantmen were wrecked at the same time.
  Several sunk with all their crew, and the remainder lost from two
  to twelve men each. Yet Mr. Lewis describes the situation of
  these ships as not so dangerous as that of the frigate, because
  the merchantmen, drawing less water, were driven closer in to
  shore, and the men were enabled to land after the first
  morning.</p>

  <p>The Apollo's company received every mark of kindness and
  attention when they got on shore, from the masters of the
  merchant vessels, who had erected tents on the beach, and who
  shared with the sufferers whatever provisions they had saved from
  the wrecks.</p>

  <p>Dead bodies floated on shore for many days after, and pieces
  of wreck covered the beach, marking the scene of <a name=
  "Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>this sad calamity. Fortunately, the
  Carysfort, with part of the convoy, escaped the fate of her
  consort by wearing, and arrived safely at Barbadoes. The
  surviving officers and crew of the Apollo marched to Figuera, a
  distance of eighteen miles, from whence they were conveyed in a
  schooner to Lisbon, and brought by the Orpheus frigate to
  Portsmouth.</p>

  <p>On their arrival in England, they were tried by a court
  martial; and it is satisfactory to know that they were all fully
  acquitted.</p>

  <p>It is a principal object in this work to draw attention to the
  advantages of firm and steady discipline in all cases of
  emergency. We cannot, therefore, omit to show than when a spirit
  of insubordination breaks out under circumstances of danger, how
  surely it is attended with fatal results.</p>

  <p>In the course of the evidence adduced before the court of
  inquiry upon the loss of the Apollo, it was proved that about
  twenty of her men had broken into the spirit room; disorder, of
  course, ensued; and Lieutenant Harvey gave it as his opinion,
  that, if these men had remained sober, many lives might have been
  spared. There is so much cause for regret in the whole
  catastrophe, that we will not harshly impute blame to one party
  or another. We may see some palliation for the misconduct of the
  men in the awful situation in which they were placed&mdash;their
  fears, perhaps, made them forgetful alike of their duty to their
  king, their country, and themselves; but it is cheering to know
  that such cases are rare in the British Navy, and we are happy in
  having very few such to record: they are alluded to only in the
  hope that our seamen may learn from them to value that strict
  discipline and order, which, in a moment of danger, is their
  greatest safeguard.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>Lieutenant, now Rear
  Admiral, Harvey subsequently served in the Amethyst, Amaranthe,
  and Intrepid. His promotion to the rank of commander took place
  in 1808, when he was appointed to the Cephalus, in the
  Mediterranean, and there he captured four of the enemy's
  privateers, and several merchant vessels. His post commission
  bears date April 18, 1811, and he was employed off Corfu till the
  month of December following. His last ship was the Implacable,
  which he paid off in 1814. He obtained his flag as rear-admiral
  in December, 1847. This officer now holds the appointment of
  Admiral Superintendent of Malta Dockyard.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="THE_HINDOSTAN" id="THE_HINDOSTAN"></a>THE
  HINDOSTAN.</h2>

  <p>In the year 1804, the Government sent out the Hindostan, of
  1100 tons, laden with supplies for Lord Nelson, then
  commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean fleet. This ship was
  commanded by Captain Le Gros, with 259 persons on board,
  including passengers, women, and children.</p>

  <p>She arrived at Gibraltar in the month of March, and sailed
  again from thence in company with the Phoebe frigate, to join
  Lord Nelson off Toulon, but she was separated from her consort
  during a heavy gale of wind, in the Gulf of Lyons.</p>

  <p>On the 2nd of April, at about seven o'clock in the morning,
  the ship being then thirteen leagues to the south-east of Cape
  St. Sebastian, a thick smoke was observed to issue from the fore
  and main hatchways.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tailour, who was on the quarter-deck, heard the cry
  of "fire," and saw the people rushing up the <a name="Page_65"
  id="Page_65"></a>hatchway in the midst of volumes of smoke,
  coming from the orlop deck. He instantly called for the drummer
  and the mate of the watch, and desired the former to beat to
  quarters, and the latter to inform Captain Le Gros of what had
  occurred, whilst he himself would go below, and endeavour to
  ascertain the cause and the place of the fire.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tailour then went down into the orlop gratings, and
  penetrated some distance into each tier; the smoke was very thick
  in both, particularly forward. He next went to the sail room,
  where there was no appearance of either fire or smoke. He was
  then joined by Lieutenant Banks and several other officers, and
  they proceeded together to the hold. Here the smoke was very
  dense, and it affected the throat like that from hot tar. The
  officers were satisfied, upon inquiry, that there had not been
  either light or tar in the hold. They then tried to re-enter the
  tiers, but were driven back by the suffocating smoke. The absence
  of heat, however, convinced them that the fire was not in that
  part of the ship. A cry was heard that the fire was down
  forward,&mdash;but we will use Lieutenant Tailour's own words to
  describe the scene. He says,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'When I reached the fore-ladder, none being able to tell me
  where the fire was, I went down to examine, when at the orlop, I
  put my head over the spars which were stowed in the starboard
  side, then behind the ladder in the larboard side; the smoke came
  thickest in the starboard side from aft; feeling nothing like
  fire heat, I attempted to go down to the cockpit, but ere I
  reached the third or fourth step on the ladder, I felt myself
  overpowered, and called for help. Several men had passed me
  upwards on my way down, none I believe were below me. By the time
  I came up to the orlop ladder, some one came and helped me; when
  I reached <a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>the lower deck, I
  fell, but not, as many did that day, lifeless.'</p>

  <p>When Lieutenant Tailour recovered, he made strict inquiries,
  whether any fire had been discovered in the cockpit or
  store-rooms, and being assured that there had not, he ordered the
  lower deck to be scuttled.</p>

  <p>So energetic was this officer, that eight or ten minutes only
  had elapsed since the first alarm had been given, before the
  hammocks were all got on deck, and the ports opened, to give
  light and room below, until the place of fire could be
  discovered, and better means obtained for drawing water. Mr.
  Tailour did not recover from the suffocation so fast as he
  expected, and was obliged to go upon deck for air. There he found
  Captain Le Gros in consultation with the master, who, being of
  opinion that the fire was on the larboard side, gave orders to
  wear the ship, so as to allow the water which had been hove in to
  flow over her. Mr. Tailour differed from them, and said he was
  convinced that the fire was on the orlop starboard side. In a few
  minutes he again went below and assisted in working the engine,
  and giving directions for scuttling on the larboard side, where
  the smoke appeared most dense.</p>

  <p>The engine, however, proved of little avail, for the smoke
  increased to such a degree as to prevent the people working on
  the orlop deck; the hatches were, therefore, laid over, the ports
  lowered, everything covered up, and all means used to prevent the
  circulation of air. Having taken these precautions, Lieutenant
  Tailour reported to Captain Le Gros what had been done, and at
  the same time advised that the boats should be got out without
  loss of time. The captain seems to have objected to this, on the
  plea that if the boats were got out, the people would all crowd
  into them, and abandon the ship without an effort to save her. To
  this objection Mr. Tailour <a name="Page_67" id=
  "Page_67"></a>replied, that to save human life must be their
  first consideration, and that every moment's delay was fraught
  with peril and death. 'If we wait,' said he, 'till the last
  moment, it may not be possible to save any; we can get the
  marines under arms.' Captain Le Gros yielded the point; he
  directed the sergeant of marines to get his men under arms, with
  orders to load with ball, and to shoot without hesitation the
  first man who should attempt to go into the boats without
  permission. All hands were then turned up, and the command given
  to 'out boats.'</p>

  <p>The order was promptly executed, and as soon as the boats were
  out and secure for towing, the ship's head was pointed to the
  north-west, with the view of nearing the land, and in hopes that
  she might fall in with the Juno.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, a party was employed in getting the booms
  overboard for a raft, the fore and main gratings were laid up and
  covered over, and Lieutenant Banks was sent down to get the
  powder out of the magazine, and stow it away in the stern
  gallery. He could only partially accomplish this; for the smoke
  increased upon them so much that the men were obliged to desist.
  The powder they had got up was thrown overboard, and water was
  poured down to drown that which remained; but the task of filling
  the magazine was hopeless, and therefore abandoned. Many of the
  men were drawn up apparently lifeless, amongst whom were
  Lieutenant Banks and the gunner. Lieutenant Tailour then went
  below to ascertain how matters were going on; he found only the
  boatswain's mate in the cockpit, who was almost stupified by the
  smoke. Mr. Tailour assisted him to reach the deck, and then the
  gallant officer was preparing to return to the magazine, taking a
  rope with him by way of precaution, when Lieutenant Banks, with
  noble generosity, darted past him, also with a rope in his hand,
  and descended on the dangerous service; but in a <a name=
  "Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>short time he was drawn up in a state
  of insensibility. All hope of doing anything with the magazine
  was then given up; but although the smoke was so powerful below,
  it had not yet got possession of the after part of the lower
  deck.</p>

  <p>It was therefore proposed, and the proposition was immediately
  acted on, to cut scuttles through the starboard foremost cabin in
  the ward-room, and one under it in the gun-room, into the
  magazine. This was found more practicable than was at first
  supposed, as the cabins kept out the smoke. When they were
  cutting these scuttles, the smoke came up in such dense volumes
  through the after-hatchway, that it was necessary to shut it
  closely up, and the scuttle in the after-part of the captain's
  cabin was opened for a passage to the ward-room, and they began
  to haul up the powder, and heave it overboard out of the gallery
  windows. The ward-room doors, and every other passage for the
  smoke were carefully closed, and thus it was kept tolerably well
  under; yet many of the men employed in the duty were taken up to
  all appearance dead. Amongst them we again find Lieutenant Banks,
  and Mr. Pearce, the gunner. We cannot proceed without expressing
  the admiration we feel for the heroism and self-devotion
  displayed by officers and men. This is the third time we have
  seen Lieutenant Banks risk his life in the performance of his
  duty, and it was not the last of such efforts to save the vessel
  and the lives of his fellow-sufferers.</p>

  <p>For the present, we will again adopt the language of
  Lieutenant Tailour:&mdash;- 'About noon,' said he, 'I went aft
  upon the poop, where many were collected, but the marines were
  drawn up on duty upon the poop above. Francis Burke, the purser's
  steward, was lying dead on one of the arm chests, said to have
  been suffocated by the smoke below. Soon after this, my attention
  was <a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>drawn forward, where a
  vast body of smoke issued from the hatchway, gallery doors,
  funnels, and scuttles, which I soon saw were blown off; I rushed
  forward and got them secured again, and in coming aft found the
  hatches had all been blown off; the two foremost main-gratings
  had gone down the hatchway. The after one I assisted to replace,
  also the tarpaulin, which was excessively hot, and left the
  carpenter to get it secured on. I next thought of the magazine,
  where I dreaded some accident. On my way aft, I met some people
  again bringing Mr. Banks up in their arms. On reaching the
  ward-room, I saw through the windows the stern ladders filled
  with people; I broke a pane of glass, and ordered them on the
  poop, threatening instant death to any one who dared disobey. On
  their beginning to move up, I just took time to summons the men
  from the magazine, and went up to the poop to see every one was
  once more under the eye of the marines. This done, the smoke
  having in a great measure subsided, the maintop-sail was filled,
  and top-gallant sails set.'</p>

  <p>About two o'clock in the afternoon, when they had been seven
  hours contending with the fire and smoke, land was discerned
  through the haze, on the weather-bow, and it was supposed to be
  above Cape Creux.</p>

  <p>Captain Le Gros, fearing the signals might fall into the
  enemy's hands, hove them all overboard. The sight of land gave a
  turn to the men's thoughts, and spurred them on to greater
  exertion. The fire rapidly increased; but the efforts of the
  captain and his noble crew increased with the danger.</p>

  <p>Again they attempted to clear the magazine; but the smoke
  again drove the men from below, and rendered them powerless.
  Their courage was, indeed, kept up by the sight of land, though
  still five leagues distant; but there was still much to be
  done&mdash;many perils yet <a name="Page_70" id=
  "Page_70"></a>surrounded them.&mdash;and it was awful to feel
  that fire and water were contending for the mastery, and that
  they must be the victims of one of these elements, unless by the
  mercy of God the progress of the conflagration was stayed, and
  time allowed them to reach the distant shore. The fire was
  increasing fearfully; so much so, that Lieutenant Tailour
  describes the lower deck 'burning like the flame in an oven.' All
  communication was cut off from the fore-part of the ship. The
  flames flew up the fore and main hatchways as high as the lower
  yards, but still the brave crew remained firm to their duty; and
  by keeping tarpaulins over the hatchways, and pouring down water,
  they managed for a time to keep the fire from taking serious hold
  abaft.</p>

  <p>But the crisis was fast approaching when human skill and human
  fortitude could be of no avail. In defiance of all their
  exertions and precautions, the devouring element pursued its
  course. Every moment it was gaining aft; and had not officers and
  men been true to themselves and to each other, they must all have
  perished. The mizenmast was on fire in the captain's cabin, and
  the flames were bursting from all the lee-ports. It was now a
  quarter past five o'clock, and they were entering the Bay of
  Rosas. Could they venture to hold on their way, and still remain
  in the ship? A moment's glance around him sufficed for Captain Le
  Gros to decide the question. The now triumphant element was no
  longer smouldering and creeping stealthily onwards amidst smoke
  and darkness, but with a lurid glare, and a sullen roar, the
  flames rolled on. The word was given to launch the raft; it was
  obeyed, and in a few minutes more the vessel struck, about a mile
  from the beach, between the Fort of Ampurius and the Church of
  St. Pierre. She was now on fire both fore and aft.
  Self-preservation is the law of nature, it is said; but there
  <a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>is a stronger law governing
  the actions of the British seaman. Officers and men were of one
  mind. They all united in putting first the women and children,
  then the sick and the foreigners, into the launch. The two yawls
  and the jolly-boat took as many as they could carry from the
  stern, and put them on board some Spanish boats from La Escada,
  which had been sent to their assistance, but which neither
  threats nor entreaties could avail to bring near to the ship.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the people were then ordered on to the raft,
  and by the time it was covered, the flames came aft so thick,
  that it was necessary to send it off from the stern. All now had
  left the ill-fated vessel, except the gallant Captain Le Gros,
  Lieutenant Tailour, and the master. When they saw all the rest
  clear away, and not till then, did they descend by the stern
  ladders into one of the yauls and pulled towards the shore, which
  they had scarcely reached when she blew up.</p>

  <p>The value of this ship was estimated at 100,000<i>l.</i>, and
  the loss to Lord Nelson must have been incalculable. Yet it is
  said that he was much more distressed by the loss of the
  despatches, which were taken by the enemy, about the same time,
  in the Swift cutter.</p>

  <p>In a letter to Lord St. Vincent, dated the 19th of April,
  Admiral Nelson says, speaking of Captain Le Gros.&mdash;"If his
  account be correct (he was then upon his trial), he had great
  merit for the order in which the ship was kept. The fire must
  have originated from medicine chests breaking, or from wet
  getting down, which caused the things to heat. The preservation
  of the crew seems little short of a miracle. I never read such a
  journal of exertions in my whole life."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id=
  "FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class=
  "fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>The captain, officers, and
  ship's company were most honourably acquitted by the sentence of
  court-martial.</p>

  <p>Brenton, in his <i>Naval History</i>, remarks, 'In support of
  the reasonable conjectures of the Admiral (Lord Nelson), as to
  the origin of the fire, we might adduce many instances of ships
  in the cotton trade having been on fire in the hold during a
  great part of their voyage from China, owing to the cargo having
  been wet when compressed into the ship. Hemp has been known to
  ignite from the same cause; and the dockyard of Brest was set on
  fire by this means in 1757. New painted canvas or tarpaulin, laid
  by before it is completely dry, will take fire; and two Russian
  frigates were nearly burnt by the accidental combination of a
  small quantity of soot, of burnt fir wood, hemp, and oil, tied up
  with some matting,'</p>

  <p>Mr. Thomas Banks, acting-lieutenant of the Hindostan, was
  recommended to Lord Nelson for promotion, by the members of the
  court-martial, in consequence of his conduct on this occasion;
  and he was advanced to the rank of lieutenant on the 23rd of
  June, 1804. This gallant officer died in 1811. Lieutenant George
  Tailour was appointed to the Tigre in 1808, and was promoted for
  his gallant conduct in cutting out a convoy of transports which
  had taken refuge in this same Bay of Rosas, where, five years
  before, he had equally distinguished himself, under even more
  trying circumstances.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_ROMNEY" id="THE_ROMNEY"></a><a name="Page_73"
  id="Page_73"></a>THE ROMNEY.</h2>

  <p>'In the month of November, 1804,' writes Brenton, in his
  <i>Naval History</i>, 'the severity of blockading the Ports of
  the Texel was practically experienced in the loss of the Romney,
  of fifty guns, commanded by Captain the Hon. John Colville.'</p>

  <p>The Romney sailed from Yarmouth on the 18th of November, under
  orders to join Rear-Admiral Russel, off the Texel; but on the
  19th she went aground on the south-west part of the sand-bank off
  the Haaks. Regular soundings had been made during the run from
  Yarmouth; and a few minutes before the ship struck, the pilots
  were confident they were on the edge of the Broad Fourteens. They
  then sounded, and the pilots proposed standing in under
  double-reefed topsails, and foretopmast stay-sail, with the wind
  S.S.W., until they should be in ten or eleven fathoms. To this
  Captain Colville objected, as from the unsettled appearance of
  the weather, and the thickness of the fog, he deemed it would be
  imprudent to approach the shore. They were accordingly in the act
  of wearing, when they perceived, through the fog, a large ship
  bearing east by north. They stood towards her to make her out
  more plainly, and in four or five minutes they discovered that
  she was a large merchant vessel on shore.<a name="FNanchor_7_7"
  id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class=
  "fnanchor">[7]</a> Upon this, the pilots were anxious to haul off
  on the larboard tack; but before the ship could be brought to the
  wind, she struck. The wind was increasing, the fog very great,
  and a heavy sea rolling in. In spite of every exertion, the water
  <a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>gained upon the vessel so
  fast, that all hope of saving her was soon at an end; and had she
  been in deep water, she must have sunk immediately. The pilots
  supposed that the Romney would be dry at low water, the topmasts
  were therefore struck, and every preparation made to shore her
  up.</p>

  <p>The captain having done all in his power to save his ship,
  next turned his attention to the preservation of his officers and
  men, determined to use every possible means for their safety.
  Minute guns were fired, in the hope that they might attract the
  notice of some of our cruisers, and procure assistance.</p>

  <p>At this time it blew a gale from the south-west, and the sea
  ran so high, as to endanger the boats which were lowered in order
  to lighten the ship.</p>

  <p>The two cutters were sent to a galliot and a schuyt, that were
  in sight near the land, to ask for help, but they failed in
  obtaining it; and one of them in returning to the Romney was
  upset in the breakers, and a master's mate with her crew
  perished. Lieutenant Baker, who commanded the other cutter,
  finding it impossible to reach the ship again, bore up to the
  Texel, in hopes of being more successful in obtaining assistance
  there than he had been with the schuyt.</p>

  <p>On board the ship, in the meantime, the minute guns were
  fired, and officers and men looked anxiously for a responsive
  signal that would tell them of approaching succour&mdash;but they
  waited in vain; no help was at hand. The people were therefore
  set to work to make rafts, and three were soon finished. Between
  two and three o'clock in the afternoon the ship struck again,
  with such violence, that the rudder broke away, and she seemed
  likely to go to pieces immediately. The captain seized the first
  moment of the weather-tide slacking to order the masts to be cut
  away, which was promptly done, <a name="Page_75" id=
  "Page_75"></a>and fortunately without causing any injury in their
  fall. After this, the ship became more easy, although the sea
  still made a clean breach over her. Captain Colville saw that the
  slightest alteration in her position would be attended with
  imminent danger, and he therefore ordered the bower anchors to be
  let go&mdash;her head then swung to the wind, and this enabled
  her to settle gradually on the sand, where she lay comparatively
  easy. Darkness was fast gathering around, and the hearts of the
  crew were becoming dreary and hopeless.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span>Nor sail nor shore appeared in sight,<br /></span>
      <span>Nought but the heavy sea and coming night.<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>When the tide flowed, no part of the ship below the
  quarter-deck was accessible. To add to the misery of their
  situation, out of the four bags of bread which had been put for
  safety into the cabin, one only could be got upon deck, and that
  one was so soaked in salt water, that the bread could scarcely be
  eaten. This, with two cheeses, and a few gallons of wine,
  composed the whole of their stock of provisions, and during the
  day they had had no leisure to take refreshment of any kind.</p>

  <p>Such was the condition of the crew of the Romney, who passed
  that awful night on the quarter-deck, the starboard side of which
  was under water at high tide. The wind blew in violent gusts;
  sleet and rain were falling, and the sea dashed over the vessel
  every instant. Although the men were shivering with cold and
  hunger, not a murmur escaped their lips, not a whisper of
  complaint; but they patiently awaited the break of day. At length
  the morning dawned, and with it hope dawned upon the hearts of
  those patient sufferers, for the wind and the waves subsided, the
  clouds gradually dispersed, and the sun shone forth with glorious
  and invigorating light and warmth.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>All eyes were turned to the
  offing, but still no assistance appeared. Captain Colville then
  resolved to hoist the white flag on the stump of the mizen mast,
  in hopes that it might be seen from the shore, and that he might
  preserve the lives of his crew by surrendering to the enemy.</p>

  <p>This step was necessary, as it was the only means of rescue
  that remained to them. The barge had been swamped along side,
  soon after the masts were cut away, and three of the crew had
  been drowned. The launch, also, which was lying to leeward, had
  parted from her grapnel, and had been obliged to bear up for the
  Texel.</p>

  <p>At 11 o'clock A.M., Captain Colville asked the carpenter if he
  thought they could remain another night upon the wreck: the
  carpenter assured him that he considered it almost impossible to
  do so, and that the attempt would be attended with the greatest
  risk to all on board. The ship had already parted amidships, the
  main beam and several others being broken.</p>

  <p>Five rafts had been carefully instructed, each fitted with a
  mast and sail; and at the earnest entreaty of the crew, Captain
  Colville, on hearing the carpenter's report, allowed a part of
  the men to leave the wreck on these rafts.</p>

  <p>About noon, as the fifth and last raft was about to leave the
  ship, seven boats (one bearing a flag of truce) were seen coming
  towards them from the shore. The captain ordered the people to
  throw the quarter-deck guns, and all the arms and warlike stores
  overboard, which they did.</p>

  <p>When the boats arrived alongside, an officer hailed the wreck,
  and said that if Captain Colville was willing to secure the
  preservation of his officers and crew, by surrendering as
  prisoners of war, the whole company should be conducted in safety
  to the Helder. Captain <a name="Page_77" id=
  "Page_77"></a>Colville felt himself obliged to submit to the
  imperious dictates of necessity, and he accordingly accepted the
  proffered conditions, and surrendered himself to the Dutch, with
  all the ship's company that remained on the wreck.</p>

  <p>Before nightfall they were all landed. Only those who have
  been placed in similar circumstances can judge of the feelings of
  men so rescued from the awful contemplation of immediate and
  certain death. How happy now did they feel in occupying a
  position, which two days before they would have shrunk from with
  horror, and have shed their life's blood to avoid. But 'there is
  no virtue like necessity,'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span>All places that the eye of heaven visits,<br /></span>
      <span>Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.<br /></span>
      <span class="i16">RICHARD II.<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And the Romney's company were wise enough to rejoice, under
  the circumstances of their hard case, in finding themselves
  safely landed in an enemy's country as prisoners of war.</p>

  <p>Nine seamen had been drowned; thirteen others, who had left
  the wreck upon a raft of timber, were afterwards picked up and
  taken on board the Eagle; the others who had been saved by the
  boats and rafts joined Captain Colville at the Helder. The
  following extracts from Captain Colville's dispatches show the
  high estimation in which he held the services of his officers and
  crew:&mdash;'That every possible exertion was made to lessen the
  calamity, after having struck, I trust will appear from the
  minutes.' ... 'Under the uneasiness of mind which the loss of the
  ship I had the honour to command, naturally occasioned, I feel
  some alleviation in reflecting upon the zealous, active, and
  orderly conduct of my officers and crew in circumstances the most
  trying, and under which they endured the severest hardships with
  cheerfulness, <a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>and in perfect
  reliance on Divine Providence, whose interposition in our behalf
  was strongly evident.'</p>

  <p>Nothing could exceed the kindness and consideration shown by
  the Dutch admiral towards the crew of the Romney. Captain
  Colville, in a letter addressed to the Secretary of the
  Admiralty, does ample justice to a generous foe:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'We have experienced,' he says, 'from the Dutch Admiral
  Kirkhurt, every attention that our distressed situation made so
  necessary, and which his disposition seems incapable of
  withholding, even from an enemy. But the wants of my
  fellow-sufferers are great, for not an article of clothing or
  anything else was saved by any one from the general wreck. I hope
  the Dutch government will be disposed to alleviate, in some
  degree, their wants,&mdash;in clothing, particularly. And I have
  solicited the assistance of Rear-Admiral Russel in obtaining
  these necessaries.'.... 'I have reason to believe we shall be
  sent to Amsterdam, until exchanged.'</p>

  <p>Subsequently, the Dutch admiral, with noble generosity, sent
  Captain Colville, with eight of his officers, to Rear-Admiral
  Russel. It is always delightful to record such traits of
  magnanimity and kindness, and we feel that British sailors can
  well afford to do honour to those virtues in others, for which
  they have ever been so distinguished themselves.</p>

  <p>Admiral Russel handsomely acknowledged his obligation to the
  Dutch government in the following letter to Admiral
  Kirkhurt:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>H.B.M. Ship Eagle, Dec. 2, 1804.</p>

    <p>'Sir&mdash;I have this moment received your flag of truce,
    conveying to me the Honourable Captain Colville, late of his
    Majesty's ship, the Romney, (wrecked upon your coast,) with
    eight of his officers, whom you have first humanely saved from
    impending destruction, and whom <a name="Page_79" id=
    "Page_79"></a>your government, with its ancient magnanimity,
    has released and restored to their country and their friends,
    on their <i>parole d'honneur</i>. They are all, Sir, most
    sensibly affected with heartfelt gratitude to the Batavian
    government for their emancipation from captivity; to Admiral
    Kirkhurt for their preservation from the jaws of death, and to
    all the Dutch officers and inhabitants of the Texel, for their
    kindness and most humane attention.</p>

    <p>'This, Sir, is nobly alleviating the rigours of war, as the
    Christian heroes of your country and mine were wont to do in
    these seas, before a considerable portion of European intellect
    was corrupted by false philosophy. Captain Colville will
    communicate to the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of
    the Admiralty, your proposal for an exchange of prisoners.
    Accept my sincere thanks, and the assurance that I am, &amp;c.
    &amp;c.</p>

    <p>'(Signed) T.M. RUSSEL.'</p>
  </div>

  <p>On the 31st of December, Captain Colville, the officers and
  ship's company of H.M. (late) ship Romney were tried by a
  court-martial on board the Africaine at Sheerness, for the loss
  of their ship off the Tezel on the 19th of November.</p>

  <p>It appeared to the court, that the loss of the ship had been
  occasioned by the thickness of the fog and the ignorance of the
  pilots; that the utmost exertions had been used by the captain,
  officers, and crew, to save the vessel after she struck, and to
  prevent the ship's company becoming prisoners of war. The
  sentence of the court was to this effect: that the captain,
  officers and crew were fully acquitted of all blame, but that the
  pilots should forfeit all their pay, and be rendered henceforth
  incapable of taking charge of any of his Majesty's ships or
  vessels of war, and that they should be imprisoned in the
  Marshalsea&mdash;one for the space of twelve, and the other, of
  six months.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>In 1805, Captain Colville
  was appointed to the Sea Fencibles, at Margate. In 1807, he
  obtained the command of L'Hercule, a 74-gun ship, on the coast of
  Portugal, and subsequently commanded the Queen on the North Sea
  Station.</p>

  <p>He succeeded to his title (Lord Colville) on the death of his
  father in 1811, and was advanced to the rank of rear-admiral in
  1819. On the 10th of November, 1821, he hoisted his flag on board
  the Semiramis, as commander-in-chief on the Irish station. Lord
  Colville died an Admiral of the White, in 1849.</p>

  <p>We are aware that the foregoing narrative may appear deficient
  in novel and striking incidents, but we have introduced it for
  the sake of exhibiting some of the best and noblest attributes of
  the true-hearted sailor&mdash;courage, patience, and perfect
  obedience under the most trying circumstances, and generous
  kindness towards an unfortunate enemy. It is well to think of
  these things, and the more we read of the details of naval
  life&mdash;its sufferings, dangers, and trials, the more fully
  shall we be persuaded that <i>true</i> courage is ever generous
  and unselfish. In the words of the quaint old song&mdash;</p>

  <h2><a name="VENERABLE" id="VENERABLE"></a><a name="Page_81" id=
  "Page_81"></a>VENERABLE.</h2>

  <p>On Saturday, the 24th of November, 1804, the fleet under the
  command of Admiral the Hon. W. Cornwallis, lay at anchor in
  Torbay. As it was late in the year, and the night dark and
  stormy, orders were given for the fleet to put to sea.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, in fishing the anchor of the Venerable, 74-gun
  ship, the fish-hook gave way, and a man was precipitated into the
  sea. The alarm was immediately given, and one of the cutters was
  ordered to be lowered. Numbers of the crew rushed aft to carry
  the orders into effect, but in the confusion, one of the falls
  was suddenly let go, the boat fell by the run, filled, and a
  midshipman and two of the crew were drowned. In a few minutes
  another boat was lowered, which fortunately succeeded in picking
  up the man who first fell overboard.</p>

  <p>Owing to this delay, the Venerable fell off considerably
  towards Brixham, and getting sternway, was unable to weather the
  Berry Head. Every effort was made to stay her, but the ship
  refused; and, not having room to wear, she drove on shore, at the
  north part of the bay, on a spot called Roundem Head, near
  Paington.</p>

  <p>Orders were given to cut away the masts, in the hopes of their
  falling between the ship and the shore. This was found
  impracticable, as the ship, from her position on the declivity of
  the rock on which she struck, heeled to such an extent, as to
  render the falling of the masts in the desired direction quite
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Her commander, Captain John Hunter, however, with undaunted
  fortitude, continued to animate the crew with hope, and
  encouraged them to acts of further perseverance, with the same
  calmness and self-possession as if <a name="Page_82" id=
  "Page_82"></a>he were simply conducting the ordinary duties of
  his ship. From the moment the ship struck, not the least
  alteration took place in his looks, words, or manner; and
  everything that the most able and experienced seaman could
  suggest was done, but in vain. On signals of distress being made,
  H.M. cutter Frisk, Lieutenant Nicholson, immediately stood
  towards her, and hailing to know in what manner she could be
  useful, was requested to anchor as near as possible to receive
  the crew, with which her commander immediately complied, assisted
  by the boats of the Goliath and Impetueux.</p>

  <p>All hope of saving the Venerable being now abandoned, the only
  object that remained was to preserve the lives of the crew, who
  were told to provide for their own safety on board the boats
  which had been sent to their assistance, the captain and officers
  declaring their intention of remaining on board till all the men
  had quitted the wreck.</p>

  <p>At this time the sea ran tremendously high, and the men
  lowered themselves into the boats from the stern, this being the
  only accessible part of the ship. Most anxious was the situation
  of the officers and men who were left, during the absence of the
  boats. Many gave up all hopes of rescue, for every time the boats
  approached the ship, the attempt became more and more dangerous.
  The night still continued dark and foggy, with driving sleet and
  violent gusts of wind, which seemed to freshen every hour. In
  this forlorn and dismal state, the officers continued on the
  outside of the ship (for she was nearly on her beam ends),
  encouraging the men, and affording every assistance for their
  escape on board the boats.</p>

  <p>The Venerable was now a complete wreck, beating against the
  rocks, and was expected to go to pieces at <a name="Page_83" id=
  "Page_83"></a>every surge; yet all this time was she so near the
  shore that those on board were able to converse with the people,
  whom the report of the guns had brought in great numbers to the
  rocks. With much difficulty, they at last contrived to fling a
  line on shore, which, being secured there, some of the crew
  attempted to land themselves by it. The surf, however, broke with
  such violence between them and the shore, although they were
  scarcely twenty yards distant, that the poor fellows who made the
  attempt were either drowned or dashed to pieces.</p>

  <p>It was now past five o'clock on Sunday morning, the weather
  still growing worse. The crew, with the exception of seventeen,
  had succeeded in quitting the ship, and these nobly declared that
  they would remain to share the fate of their officers. The
  situation of the whole was indeed appalling, and sufficient to
  quail the boldest heart; the sea breaking over them, the fore
  part of the ship under water, and the rest expected momentarily
  to go to pieces. Under these circumstances, the officers, feeling
  that they could be of no further use on board, deemed it their
  duty to represent to the captain the necessity of endeavouring to
  save their lives, they having one and all resolved on sharing his
  fate.</p>

  <p>This point being arranged, the hopes of life began to revive;
  but a further difficulty presented itself, which seemed to render
  their safety more problematical than ever. This was, who was to
  lead the way. The pause had well nigh been fatal to them all. At
  length a junior lieutenant, long known on board, and celebrated
  for his courage, agreed to lead the way, the rest solemnly
  promising to follow. One after another they descended from the
  stern by a single rope, wet, cold, and benumbed; and in this
  condition they gained the boats, <a name="Page_84" id=
  "Page_84"></a>which were in perilous attendance below. About six
  o'clock they reached the Impetueux, where they were treated with
  every attention and kindness which their unfortunate position so
  loudly called for. They quitted the ship in a most critical time,
  for in a little more than an hour after they had left her, she
  parted amidships&mdash;that part on which they had been standing
  for the last five or six hours capsized and was buried in the
  surf. In sixteen hours from the time she first struck, the whole
  vessel had disappeared, under the action of a raging surf, lashed
  into fury by the violence of the gale.</p>

  <p>The conduct of the people on shore was most inhuman; not the
  slightest assistance was offered; not a single boat from Brixham
  or Torquay having put out to their assistance during the whole of
  this dreadful night. To add to this disgraceful conduct, the
  cowardly wretches were observed, when daylight broke, plundering
  everything of value as it floated ashore.</p>

  <p>The following is the tribute of praise which Captain Hunter so
  justly pays to Captain Martin and the officers and crew of the
  Impetueux:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"To Captain Martin, of the Impetueux, whose feelings as a
    man, as well as his zeal as an officer, were on this
    distressing occasion so conspicuous.&mdash;It is the desire of
    the officers and crew of the Venerable in this place to express
    the high sense they have of the obligations they are under to
    his personal exertions, as well as those of the officers and
    boats' crews whom he employed in this difficult and dangerous
    service,&mdash;for it is to their exertions they owe the life
    they now enjoy."</p>
  </div>

  <p>Captain Hunter also speaks of the conduct of his own ship's
  company in the highest terms. Their steadiness throughout was
  most remarkable, and to this, in a great measure, may be
  attributed the preservation of their own lives.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>One solitary instance of
  neglect of duty occurred; and when we consider the circumstances
  in which the men were placed, and the temptations which never
  fail to present themselves on such occasions, the highest praise
  is not only due to the crew, but also to the captain and
  officers, who, by their previous conduct, had gained the respect
  and confidence of those under them. It is in such moments of
  severe trial that the character of a ship's company is put to the
  test; and the good behaviour of the men who remained with their
  officers proves that, in order to maintain a proper degree of
  discipline, no undue severity need be practised.</p>

  <p>To a comparatively recent period, the captain of a man-of-war
  had the power of inflicting corporal punishment to an unlimited
  extent. This practice has of late years much diminished; owing,
  in a great measure, to the increased good feeling of naval
  officers, as also to the Admiralty discountenancing such strong
  measures, unless in most urgent cases. A captain of a man-of-war
  has, notwithstanding, and very properly so, an almost absolute
  power, and corporal punishment rests with him alone; but the
  humane officer, like Captain Hunter, punishes one man to save
  many others, and shares with the delinquent the pain which, for
  the sake of example, he is obliged to inflict. The discipline of
  a ship of course depends almost entirely upon the conduct of the
  captain; to him the officers look for guidance and example; and
  whilst they see that the men do their duty properly, they also
  learn from him to treat them with due consideration, having their
  happiness and comfort in view. As in the case of the Venerable,
  when the hour of danger arrives, each cheerfully performs the
  duties allotted to him, relying with confidence on those who,
  from their clemency, combined with firmness, they have been
  accustomed to look up to with respect.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>An additional interest
  belongs to the fate of this vessel, when we bear in mind that her
  crew, whilst serving under Lord Duncan, in 1797, remained
  untainted during the celebrated mutiny at the Nore.<a name=
  "FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"
  class="fnanchor">[8]</a> She also bore a conspicuous part in Lord
  Duncan's action with the Dutch fleet, in October of the same
  year, engaging the Vryheid, the flag-ship of the Dutch
  admiral.</p>

  <p>The account of this great battle, however, is too well
  recorded in the page of history to need repetition. It is
  sufficient to add, that the Vryheid, after a noble resistance,
  was ultimately obliged to strike, under the destructive fire of
  the Venerable, Triumph, Ardent, and Director.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_SHEERNESS" id="THE_SHEERNESS"></a>THE
  SHEERNESS.</h2>

  <p>In the afternoon of the 7th of January, 1805, His Majesty's
  ship Sheerness, of 44 guns, was lying at anchor in the Colombo
  Roads, Ceylon.</p>

  <p>It was one of those days of extreme stillness which often
  precede the frightful hurricanes that sweep the eastern seas. Not
  a breath of air stirred, not a cloud was to be seen; the ship lay
  motionless on the calm and glassy water. The ensign drooped in
  heavy folds from the stern, and many of the crew lay stretched on
  the decks in listless apathy, little anticipating the terrible
  convulsion of the elements which was so soon to arouse them in
  fear. The monotony on board was broken for a moment by the voice
  of the captain, Lord George Stuart, <a name="Page_87" id=
  "Page_87"></a>who ordered his gig to be manned that he might go
  on shore with his first lieutenant, Mr. Swan, and some other
  officers, whom he had invited to dine with him under a tent. The
  bustle of their departure from the ship was soon over, and again
  all was still. The captain and officers had scarcely landed and
  seated themselves at table, when a roaring sound was heard, at
  first distant, but becoming louder and louder every moment, and
  before they could conjecture the cause, the canvass of the tent
  was almost torn from its fastenings by the sudden violence of the
  wind.</p>

  <p>Every one thought first of the Sheerness, and rushing from the
  tent a scene presented itself to their gaze little calculated to
  diminish their alarm for the ship.</p>

  <p>The sea, which a few minutes before had been smooth as a
  polished mirror, now displayed a picture of terrific grandeur;
  the waves, crested with foam, rolled and tossed over one another
  in wild confusion, whilst the roaring of the winds, and the
  torrents of rain, added to the awful sublimity of the scene. Lord
  George, though aware of the imminent danger to which he exposed
  himself, determined at all risks to get on board his ship.
  Without a moment's delay he collected the crew of the gig, and
  pushed from the shore towards the vessel&mdash;himself steering
  the boat, whilst Lieutenant Swan pulled the bow oar. The wind had
  now increased to such a hurricane as is only known in tropical
  climates, and the waves threatened every instant to engulf the
  frail bark. As they advanced, the danger became more and more
  urgent; the sea broke over them continually; nevertheless, they
  persevered, and strained every nerve to effect their object.</p>

  <p>The stunning roar of the hurricane prevented any communication
  except by signs, and several times the wind caught the oars with
  such force that the men could <a name="Page_88" id=
  "Page_88"></a>scarcely retain their seats. In vain were all their
  efforts:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i4">The winds arise,<br /></span> <span>The
      thunder rolls, the forky lightning flies;<br /></span>
      <span>In vain the master issues out commands,<br /></span>
      <span>In vain the trembling sailors ply their
      hands,<br /></span> <span>The tempest, unforeseen, prevents
      their care,<br /></span> <span>And from the first they labour
      in despair.<br /></span> <span class=
      "i19">Dryden.<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The boat filled with water three times, and became so nearly
  unmanageable, that they saw it would be impossible to gain the
  ship, and they bore up to the west part of York Island, from
  whence they waded to the shore, but so exhausted from the fatigue
  they had undergone, that they could never have reached the land,
  had they not been assisted by some workmen who were on the
  spot.</p>

  <p>When they arrived, they found Mr. Warner, a midshipman, had
  just landed from the Sheerness, with a message to the effect that
  the ship had parted an anchor, but that she was riding in safety
  with two others. Mr. Warner had been sent in the launch, but in
  nearing the shore, she had been upset, and two of her crew were
  drowned; there was little hope, therefore, of any boat weathering
  the storm in an attempt to reach the ship.</p>

  <p>Lord George, however, would not give up the attempt, and he
  expressed so much anxiety to join his vessel, that it was
  proposed to go to the weathermost part of the bay. Thither they
  accordingly struggled on foot, with the utmost difficulty making
  head against the wind, and suffering acutely from the sand
  driving into their eyes. In addition to their personal
  sufferings, the spectacle around was one of such desolation and
  horror as no man can witness without pain. The shore, as far as
  the eye could reach, was covered with wrecks, and with the bodies
  of the dying and the dead, while the roaring of <a name="Page_89"
  id="Page_89"></a>the surf, and the howling of the tempest,
  mingled with the piercing cries of those on board the stranded
  vessels, who were yet struggling with their fate, added to the
  awfulness of the scene.</p>

  <p>At half-past six in the evening, exhausted with fatigue and
  suffering, they arrived at the head of the bay; but here they
  were again doomed to disappointment, for they found no one to
  assist them in launching the boat, although the crew of the
  launch had been directed to join them for that purpose.</p>

  <p>The ship was still in sight, but they found it would be
  impossible to reach her, and they therefore proceeded to the
  neighbouring town of Ostenberg, where they directed a soldier
  whom they met, to hasten to his commanding officer, and request
  that a party of soldiers with torches should be ordered out ready
  to save the crew of the Sheerness, in case of her driving on
  shore.</p>

  <p>Lord George and his companions then went to the master
  attendant's house, where they passed the night; but although they
  were worn out in mind and body, sleep never closed their eyes
  that night&mdash;they passed it in listening to the reports of
  the signal guns from the Sheerness, and in watching the rockets
  which from time to time illuminated the darkness, telling of
  distress and danger which they could not alleviate.</p>

  <p>When morning broke, they assembled all the workmen they could
  muster, and manning a cutter with the crew of the launch, they
  went off to the Sheerness, which had been driven on shore to the
  west of York Island.</p>

  <p>There a most distressing sight presented itself; two vessels
  had been driven on shore, one of which was totally lost. The
  Sheerness had parted her cables during the night, and for a time
  her situation was exceedingly perilous, it was impossible to
  stand upon deck till the main and mizen masts had been cut away.
  The water <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>rose above the orlop
  deck till it became level with the surface of the sea.</p>

  <p>Not a barrack-house or tree escaped the ravages of the storm;
  many were levelled with the ground, others extensively damaged,
  and the hospital was completely unroofed, which rendered the
  situation of the sick most deplorable. One of the patients was
  killed by the falling beams. Several Europeans fell a sacrifice
  to the storm, many of them being exposed to the torrents of rain
  without any place of shelter within reach.</p>

  <p>Lord George Stuart, the officers and crew of the Sheerness
  were acquitted of all blame respecting the loss of that vessel,
  it being the opinion of the court, that 'Every exertion was made
  for the preservation of the ship by the captain, officers, and
  crew upon that trying occasion; and that, owing to the violence
  of the hurricane, the loss of the ship was inevitable; and every
  subsequent attempt to get her afloat proved ineffectual, in
  consequence of the damage she had sustained in grounding when
  driven on shore, from the impossibility of keeping her free by
  means of the pumps.'</p>

  <p>Lord George Stuart entered the navy in the year 1793 as a
  midshipman on board the Providence, in which ship he had the
  misfortune to be wrecked in the year 1797.</p>

  <p>He received his post rank in 1804, and was almost constantly
  employed from that time until 1809, when he assumed the command
  of a light squadron at the mouth of the Elbe.</p>

  <p>Here he performed an important service in taking the town of
  Gessendorf, situated on the banks of the Weser, and in driving
  from the fortress a body of French troops who had made frequent
  predatory and piratical excursions in the neighbourhood of
  Cuxhaven.</p>

  <p>A few days after the defeat of the French, the gallant Duke of
  Brunswick also arrived on the opposite banks of <a name="Page_91"
  id="Page_91"></a>the Weser, after having almost succeeded in
  effecting his retreat through the heart of Germany. By the
  previous dispersion of the enemy and the destruction of the
  fortress, he succeeded in crossing the river and escaping his
  pursuers, who would otherwise, in all probability, have captured
  or destroyed the whole of his detachment.</p>

  <p>His Lordship was next appointed to the Horatio, a 38-gun
  frigate. Whilst cruizing on the morning of the 7th December,
  1813, off the Island of Zealand, he received a letter from a
  gentleman who had been in the British service, requesting his aid
  to drive the French from Zierick-Zee, the capital of Schowen. He
  at once complied with this request, and directed a detachment of
  seamen and marines to storm the batteries as soon as the tide
  would answer for the boats to leave the ship, which could not be
  done until nine P.M. In the meantime, a deputation arrived on
  board from the principal citizens, bearing a flag of truce from
  the French general, and requesting, that in order to save the
  effusion of blood, and to prevent the disorders which would in
  all probability arise, as the city was then in a state of
  insurrection, terms of capitulation should be granted, by which
  the French should be allowed to withdraw with their baggage to
  Bergen-op-Zoom. To this, Lord George Stuart gave a peremptory
  refusal, and summoned the French to surrender unconditionally.
  After a short delay, the signal of surrender was made, and thus,
  by the promptitude and decision displayed by the British officer,
  the French were compelled to evacuate the Island of Schowen
  without bloodshed, and the ancient magistrates of Zierick-Zee
  resumed their former functions.</p>

  <p>Lord George Stuart subsequently commanded the Newcastle, and
  was employed in the last American war. In 1815, he received the
  Order of the Companion of the Bath, and died as rear-admiral in
  1841.</p>

  <h2><a name="ATHENIENNE" id="ATHENIENNE"></a><a name="Page_92"
  id="Page_92"></a>ATHENIENNE.</h2>

  <p>The Athenienne, of 64 guns, commanded by Captain Robert
  Raynsford, with a crew of 470 men, sailed from Gibraltar on the
  16th of October, 1806, and at noon on the 20th, the Island of
  Sardinia was seen in the distance. The ship continued under a
  press of sail with a fair wind, and sped on her course towards
  Malta. At eight o'clock of the evening of the 20th, the first
  watch had been stationed, and the officer on duty had reported
  the ship's progress at nine knots an hour. The labours of the day
  were over, and all, save the few whom duty or inclination kept on
  deck, had gone below. Another hour passed away; the majority of
  the crew had retired to their berths to seek repose after the
  toils of the day, and to gain fresh strength for the
  morrow&mdash;that morrow which many of them were destined never
  to behold.</p>

  <p>One there was on board the Athenienne, to whose care the
  safety of the vessel and the lives of her crew had been
  entrusted, who appeared to have misgivings as to the course she
  was steering. The captain was seated in his cabin, looking over
  the chart with one of his officers, when he exclaimed, 'If the
  Esquerques do exist, we are now on them,' Scarcely were the words
  out of his mouth when the ship struck.</p>

  <p>For the information of our readers, we must state that the
  Esquerques, or Shirki, are a reef of sunken rocks lying about
  eighty miles west from Sicily, and about forty-eight from Cape
  Bon, on the coast of Africa. In 1806, the charts were not as
  accurate as they are in the present day, and the reef was not
  laid down in all of them; the very existence, indeed, of these
  rocks was <a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>positively denied by
  some navigators, though it was as positively asserted by
  others.</p>

  <p>It would be vain to attempt to describe the scene that
  followed the first shock, on the vessel's striking the rock. Upon
  the captain's hastening on deck, he found the crew rushing up
  from their berths, many of them in a state of nudity, and so
  stupified as to be utterly incapable of making the least effort
  for their own preservation. Some went below, and for the moment
  resigned themselves to despair, while others rushed to the poop
  for safety.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes, the officers had gathered round their
  captain. It needed no words to point out to them the imminence of
  their danger, and the necessity of their setting an example of
  steadiness and intrepidity to the men. They suffered no signs of
  dismay to appear in their demeanour, but immediately proceeded to
  consider what were the best steps to be taken to meet the
  impending danger. The calmness and courage thus displayed by the
  captain and his officers could not fail of having the desired
  effect upon the ship's company, who recovered from their panic,
  and seeing the necessity for instant exertion, held themselves in
  readiness to execute each order as it was issued.</p>

  <p>In order to prevent the ship falling on her broadside, the
  masts were cut away; but she continued to beat so violently upon
  the rocks, that in less than half-an-hour she filled with water
  up to the lower deck ports, and then fell over to larboard on her
  beam ends. Captain Raynsford, foreseeing the inevitable loss of
  his vessel, had ordered the boats to be hoisted out, with the
  idea that they would be useful in towing a raft, which he had
  caused to be constructed to leeward. This raft would probably
  have been the means of preserving a great <a name="Page_94" id=
  "Page_94"></a>many lives, had not the men in charge of the two
  jolly-boats pushed off, and left their unhappy comrades to their
  fate. Unfortunately, both the cutter and the barge, in hoisting
  out, were stove, and immediately swamped, no less than thirty men
  perishing with them. Several of the crew had been killed by the
  falling of the masts, and others were severely injured. Two
  midshipmen were crushed to death between the spanker boom and the
  bulwarks.</p>

  <p>Brenton has thus described the horrible scene on
  board:&mdash;'Nothing was to be heard but the shrieks of the
  drowning and the wailings of despair. The man who would
  courageously meet death at the cannon's mouth, or at the point of
  the bayonet, is frequently unnerved in such a scene as this,
  where there is no other enemy to contend with than the inexorable
  waves, and no hope of safety or relief but what may be afforded
  by a floating plank or mast. The tremendous shocks as the ship
  rose with the sea, and fell again on the rocks, deprived the
  people of the power of exertion; while at every crash portions of
  the shattered hull, loosened and disjointed, were scattered in
  dreadful havoc among the breakers. Imagination can scarcely
  picture to itself anything more appalling than the frantic
  screams of the women and children, the darkness of the night, the
  irresistible fury of the waves, which, at every moment, snatched
  away a victim, while the tolling of the bell, occasioned by the
  violent motion of the wreck, added a funereal solemnity to the
  horrors of the scene.'</p>

  <p>The fate of the hapless crew seemed fast approaching to a
  termination. When the vessel first struck, signal guns had been
  fired, in the hope that some aid might be within reach, but none
  appeared; the guns were soon rendered useless, and when the ship
  fell on her beam ends, the wreck, with the exception of the poop,
  was <a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>entirely under water. Here
  were collected all that remained of the ship's company, whose
  haggard countenances and shivering forms were revealed to each
  other, from time to time, by the glare of the blue lights, and by
  the fitful moonbeams which streamed from beneath the dark clouds,
  and threw their pale light upon the despairing group.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span>The sea-breached vessel can no longer bear<br /></span>
      <span>The floods that o'er her burst in dread
      career;<br /></span> <span>The labouring hull already seems
      half filled<br /></span> <span>With water, through an hundred
      leeks distilled;<br /></span> <span>Thus drenched by every
      wave, her even deck,<br /></span> <span>Stripped and
      defenceless, floats a naked wreck.<br /></span> <span class=
      "i16">FALCONER.<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Two boats only remained, one of which was useless, her side
  having been knocked in by the falling of the masts; and the
  other, the launch, was therefore the sole means of preservation
  left. She was already filled with men, but it was found
  impossible to remove her from her position on the booms; and even
  if she had floated, she could not have contained above one-fourth
  of the crew. For about half an hour she continued in the same
  position, (the men who were in her expecting every moment that
  her bottom would be knocked out by the waves dashing against the
  spars on which she rested,) when suddenly a heavy sea lifted her
  off the bows clear of the ship. Three loud cheers greeted her
  release, and the oars being ready, the men immediately pulled
  from the wreck, with difficulty escaping the many dangers they
  had to encounter from the floating spars and broken masts.</p>

  <p>These gallant fellows, however, would not desert their
  companions in misfortune, and although their boat already
  contained more than a hundred, they pulled towards the stern of
  the frigate; but so great was the <a name="Page_96" id=
  "Page_96"></a>anxiety of the poor creatures upon the poop to jump
  into the boat, that in self-defence they were obliged to keep at
  a certain distance from the wreck, or the launch would have been
  instantly swamped. They were therefore reduced to the terrible
  alternative, either of leaving their comrades to perish, or of
  throwing away their own lives. Nine of the men who had jumped
  overboard were picked up, but to have attempted to save any more
  would have been to sacrifice all. One of the officers left on
  board the wreck endeavoured by every argument to persuade Captain
  Raynsford to save himself by swimming to the launch, but all in
  vain. This intrepid man declared that he was perfectly resigned
  to his fate, and was determined not to quit his ship whilst a man
  remained on board. Finding that all entreaties were useless, the
  officer himself jumped overboard from the stern gallery into the
  sea, and swimming through the surf, gained the launch and was
  taken on board.</p>

  <p>The general cry in the boat was, 'Pull off!' and at twelve
  o'clock, as the moon sunk below the horizon, her crew took their
  last look of the Athenienne. The situation of the launch was of
  itself imminently perilous: she had neither sail, bread, nor
  water on board. Fortunately there was a compass, and for a sail
  the officers made use of their shirts and the frocks of the
  seamen. On the following morning they fell in with a Danish brig,
  which relieved, in some degree, their urgent necessities.
  Lieutenant John Little, a passenger in the Athenienne, with a
  party of seamen, went on board the brig, for the purpose of
  prevailing on her master to return with them to the wreck, in
  hopes of rescuing any of the crew who might be still alive; but
  this generous purpose was frustrated by violent and adverse
  winds.</p>

  <p>On the 21st, at four o'clock in the afternoon, the party
  reached Maritimo, having been sixteen hours in the open <a name=
  "Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>boat, and the next day they proceeded
  to Trepani, in Sicily. On the 24th, they arrived at Palermo; the
  news of the sad event had already been conveyed thither to Sir
  Sidney Smith, by a letter which had been written from Maritimo.
  The Eagle, of 74 guns, was instantly ordered to the Esquerques,
  but returned with the intelligence, that all who were left upon
  the wreck had perished, with the exception of two men, who had
  been picked up on a raft by some fishermen. They related that the
  poop had separated about eleven o'clock on the morning after the
  launch left them, and that they, together with ten others, clung
  to it, but all had either been washed off or died except
  themselves. There were also two other rafts, on one of which were
  three warrant officers, and on the other Captain Raynsford and
  Lieutenants Swinburne and Salter; but it was found impossible to
  disengage the rafts from the rigging to which they were attached,
  and the unfortunate men all perished.</p>

  <p>The existence of the Esquerques, as we have already stated,
  had been doubted, but from Captain Raynsford's exclamation,
  previous to the ship striking, we may infer that he himself was
  not sceptical on the subject. From whatever cause this fine
  frigate may have been lost, the gallantry, at least, and
  self-devotion of her commander, from the time the vessel first
  struck, will rescue his memory from reproach.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_NAUTILUS" id="THE_NAUTILUS"></a>THE
  NAUTILUS.</h2>

  <p>ONLY a few weeks after the loss of the Athenienne, and of so
  many of her crew, a shipwreck occurred in another part of the
  Mediterranean, attended by circumstances of most painful
  interest.</p>

  <p>His Majesty's sloop, Nautilus, commanded by Captain Palmer,
  left the squadron of Sir Thomas Louis in the Hellespont, on the
  morning of the: 3rd of January, 1807, bearing dispatches of the
  utmost importance for England.</p>

  <p>The wind blowing fresh from the north-east, the sloop
  continued her course through the Archipelago without danger or
  mischance, until the evening of the 4th, when she was off Anti
  Milo; the pilot then gave up his charge, professing himself
  ignorant of the coast they were now approaching. As the
  dispatches confided to Captain Palmer were of great moment, he
  determined to run every hazard rather than retard their delivery.
  He therefore sailed from Anti Milo at sunset, and shaped his
  course to Cerigotto. At midnight, the wind had risen to a gale;
  the night was dark and gloomy; torrents of rain were falling,
  accompanied by loud and incessant peals of thunder, whilst vivid
  flashes of lightning ever and anon illuminated for an instant the
  murky sky, and left all in obscurity more dismal than before.</p>

  <p>At two o'clock A.M., the tempest and the darkness having
  increased, the captain gave orders to close-reef <a name=
  "Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>topsails, and prepare for bringing-to
  until daybreak. A little after three o'clock, a bright flash of
  lightning discovered to them, the Island of Cerigotto right
  ahead, and about a mile distant. The captain considered his
  course to be now clear, and therefore directed all possible sail
  to be kept on the vessel without endangering the masts, at the
  same time he congratulated Lieutenant Nesbitt upon their escape
  from the threatened dangers of the Archipelago.</p>

  <p>He then went below, and was engaged with the pilot in
  examining the chart, when a cry was heard of 'Breakers ahead!'
  Lieutenant Nesbitt, who was on deck, ordered the helm a-lee; it
  was scarcely done, when the vessel struck. The shock was so
  violent, that the men below were thrown out of their hammocks,
  and they had difficulty in getting upon deck, for every sea
  lifted up the ship and then again dashed her upon the rocks with
  such force that they could not keep their feet. All was confusion
  and alarm. Every one felt his own utter helplessness.</p>

  <p>'Oh! my Lord,' writes Lieutenant Nesbitt to Lord Collingwood,
  'it draws tears from my eyes when I reflect on the complicated
  miseries of the scene! Heaven, now our only resource, was
  piteously invoked; and happy am I to say, our gallant crew left
  nothing untried which we imagined could save us&mdash;all
  cheerfully obeying the orders of the officers. An instant had
  hardly elapsed ere our main-deck was burst in, and a few minutes
  after the lee bulwark was entirely overwhelmed. A heavy sea broke
  entirely over us, and none could see the smallest aperture
  through which hope might enter, and enliven the chill and dreary
  prospect before us.'</p>

  <p>The only chance of escape for the crew was by the boats, and
  one only, a small whale-boat, got clear of the ship in safety,
  the others were all either stove or washed <a name="Page_100" id=
  "Page_100"></a>off the booms and dashed to pieces on the rocks by
  the raging surf. The boat that escaped was manned by the
  coxswain, George Smith, and nine others. When they got clear of
  the wreck, they lay on their oars, and those who had clothing
  shared it with others who were nearly naked. They then pulled
  towards the Island of Pauri, seeing that it was impossible for
  them to render any assistance to their wretched comrades, as the
  boat already carried as many as she could possibly stow.</p>

  <p>After the departure of the whale-boat, the ship continued to
  strike every two or three minutes, but as she was thrown higher
  on the rock, the men perceived that a part of it was above water;
  and as they expected the vessel to go to pieces at every shock,
  that lonely rock offered a safer refuge from the waves than the
  frail timbers to which they were clinging. The mercy of
  Providence soon provided them with the means of exchanging their
  perilous situation for one of less certain and instant danger.
  The mainmast fell over the side about twenty minutes after the
  vessel struck, and the mizen and foremasts followed. These all
  served as gangways by which the people passed through the surf
  from the wreck to the platform of the coral reef, and thus for
  the time were rescued from the certain death that awaited them if
  they remained on board.</p>

  <p>The rock, which they reached with difficulty, was scarcely
  above water; it was between three and four hundred yards long,
  and two hundred wide; and upon this spot, in the midst of the
  deep, nearly a hundred men were thrown together, without food,
  almost without clothing, and with very little hope that they
  should ever escape from the perils that surrounded them. They had
  only left the wreck in time to hear her dashed to pieces against
  the rocks; her timbers quivering, rending, and groaning, as they
  were riven asunder by the remorseless waves. <a name="Page_101"
  id="Page_101"></a>When day dawned upon the cheerless group, its
  light only revealed new horrors: the sea on all sides was strewed
  with fragments of the wreck; not a sail was visible on the
  waters, and many of their comrades were seen clinging to spars
  and planks, tossed hither and thither by the waves. The situation
  of the survivors was truly distressing; they were at least twelve
  miles from the nearest island, and their only chance of relief
  was in the possibility of a ship passing near enough to see the
  signal which they hoisted on a long pole fixed to the rocks.</p>

  <p>The day was bitterly cold, and with much difficulty the
  unfortunate men contrived to kindle a fire, by means of a knife
  and flint that were happily in the pocket of one of the sailors,
  and a small barrel of damp powder that had been washed on to the
  rock. They next constructed a tent with pieces of canvas, boards,
  and parts of the wreck, and so they were enabled to dry the few
  clothes they had upon them. And now they had to pass a long and
  dreary night, exposed to hunger, cold, and wet; but they kept the
  fire burning, hoping that it might be visible in the darkness,
  and be taken for a signal of distress. And so it proved; for the
  coxswain and crew of the whale boat, who were on the Island of
  Pauri, observed the fire in the middle of the night, and the next
  morning the coxswain and pilot, with four of the men, pulled to
  the rocks, in hopes that some of their comrades might be still
  living.</p>

  <p>They were beyond measure astonished to find so many survivors
  from the wreck, when they had scarcely dared to hope that any
  could have been saved except themselves. They had no food or
  water in their boat; for they had found nothing on the Island of
  Pauri (which was only a mile in circumference) but a few sheep
  and goats, kept there by the inhabitants of Cerigo, and a
  <a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>little rain-water that was
  preserved in a hole of the rock. The coxswain attempted to
  persuade Captain Palmer to come into the boat, but the intrepid
  officer refused. 'Never mind me,' was his noble reply; 'save your
  unfortunate shipmates.'</p>

  <p>After some consultation, the Captain ordered the coxswain to
  take ten of the people from the rock and make the best of his way
  to Cerigotto, and return as soon as possible with assistance.</p>

  <p>Soon after the departure of the boat, the wind increased to a
  gale, the waves dashed over the rock and extinguished the fire,
  and some of the men were compelled to cling to the highest part
  of the rock, and others to hold on by a rope fastened round a
  projecting point, in order to save themselves from being washed
  away by the surf; and thus a second night was passed, even more
  wretched than the first. Many of the people became delirious from
  the fatigue, hunger, thirst, and cold, which they had suffered,
  and several died during the night; some, apparently, from the
  effect of the intense cold upon their exhausted frames. Terrible
  was the scene which daylight presented: indiscriminately crowded
  together on a small spot, were the living, the dying, and the
  dead; and the wretched survivors unable to give any help to those
  whose sufferings might shortly be their own.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to be done, but to wait in hope for the
  return of the whale-boat, when, to the indescribable joy of all,
  a ship, with all sail set, hove in sight: she was coming down
  before the wind, and steering directly for the rock.</p>

  <p>This cheering sight infused vigour into the weakest and most
  desponding. Signals of distress were instantly made, and at last
  they were perceived by the vessel, which brought to, and then
  hoisted out her boat. Great <a name="Page_103" id=
  "Page_103"></a>was the joy of all the famishing creatures on the
  rock, to see their deliverance at hand; the strongest began to
  fasten spars and planks together to form rafts, on which they
  might get to the ship; the boat came within pistol-shot. She was
  full of men, who rested on their oars for a few minutes, as if to
  examine the persons whom they were approaching: the man at the
  helm waved his hat, and then the boat's head was put round and
  they pulled back again to the ship, and left the crew of the
  Nautilus to their fate.</p>

  <p>The transition from hope to despair was terrible,&mdash;all
  that day they watched in vain for the return of their own boat
  from Cerigotto; but hour after hour passed away, and they began,
  at length, to fear that she had been lost in the gale of the
  preceding night.</p>

  <p>Death, in its most horrible forms, now stared them in the
  face; the pangs of hunger and thirst were almost insupportable.
  There was&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Some, indeed, of the poor sufferers were desperate enough to
  allay their raging thirst with salt water, in spite of the
  entreaties and warnings of those who knew how terrible are its
  effects. In a few hours those who had drunk it were seized with
  violent hysteria and raving madness, which in many ended in
  death.</p>

  <p>Another night drew on, and they made their sad preparations
  for it by huddling together as closely as they could, to keep
  alive the little warmth that remained in their bodies, and
  covering themselves with the few ragged garments that were left.
  Happily the weather was more moderate, and they hoped to be able
  to get through the night; but worn out as they were, the ravings
  of some of their companions banished sleep from the eyes of the
  <a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>rest. In the middle of the
  night they were unexpectedly hailed by the crew of the
  whale-boat.</p>

  <p>The first cry from the rock was&mdash;'water! water!' but
  water they had none. They had found it impossible to procure
  anything but earthen vessels, and these could not be carried
  through the surf. The coxswain, however, informed them that next
  morning a large vessel would come to their relief; and in this
  hope of a speedy deliverance they were encouraged to further
  endurance. The morning broke at last, but no boat appeared; then
  came a reaction, and the heart-sickness of hope deferred. The
  scenes that occurred on that day were too dreadful to
  relate&mdash;it was the fourth on which they had not tasted
  food.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>Before evening death had
  made fearful ravages, and had numbered amongst its victims
  Captain Palmer and the first lieutenant.</p>

  <p>Another night came on; long and anxiously had they gazed upon
  the horizon&mdash;in vain had they strained their blood-shot eyes
  to see some vessel coming to their relief. The shades of night
  closed round them, and sadly they awaited the dawn of another
  day, resolving that if they lived to see it they would construct
  a raft and commit themselves to the waves, rather than remain to
  die of hunger and thirst. Accordingly, at daylight they began to
  put their plan into execution by fastening some of the larger
  spars together, and in a few hours the raft was completed. The
  eventful moment for launching it arrived, when with bitter grief
  and disappointment they beheld the work of their hands, which it
  had cost them so much labour to achieve, dashed to pieces in a
  few seconds and scattered adrift upon the waves. Some of the men,
  rendered desperate by seeing their last chance of escape thus
  snatched from them, rushed into the sea, grasping at such parts
  of the wreck as came within their reach; but they were all swept
  away by the current, and their unhappy comrades saw them no
  more.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon, the coxswain arrived in the whale-boat, but
  he came without bringing them any food or means of
  escape&mdash;for all his entreaties had been unavailing to
  persuade the Greek fishermen to put to sea whilst the gale
  continued. They had, however, promised to come to the relief of
  the sufferers the next day if the weather should be more
  favourable.</p>

  <p>This was the fifth day that these wretched men had passed
  without food of any kind except the disgusting morsel they had
  attempted to swallow. Many who were completely exhausted,
  stretched their weary limbs on the hard rocks and expired, and
  before night the greater <a name="Page_106" id=
  "Page_106"></a>part of the survivors were in a state of complete
  insensibility.</p>

  <p>On the sixth morning they were scarcely able to raise
  themselves from the rock to look once more upon the sea, when one
  less feeble than the rest exclaimed, 'the boats are coming.' And
  most welcome was the sight of four fishing vessels, and the
  whale-boat steering towards them. Such joy was theirs as can only
  be understood by those who have experienced a similar deliverance
  from the jaws of death. The boats reached the rocks; they
  contained a supply of water and food, which were distributed in
  moderation among the perishing seamen, who, when they were a
  little renovated, were taken on board the boats, and in a few
  hours landed on Cerigotto.</p>

  <p>The poor but hospitable inhabitants of the island received the
  strangers most kindly, and tended them with the utmost care. Out
  of one hundred and twenty-two, sixty-four only survived. And when
  we think of the complicated miseries they had so long endured, we
  may wonder that so many were spared.</p>

  <p>After remaining eleven days at Cerigotto, the remnant of the
  crew of the Nautilus went to Cerigo, and from thence they sailed
  to Malta.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Nesbitt and the survivors were tried by a
  court-martial at Cadiz for the loss of the Nautilus.</p>

  <p>The court gave it as their opinion, 'That the loss of that
  sloop was occasioned by the captain's zeal to forward the public
  dispatches, which induced him to run in a dark, tempestuous night
  for the passage between the Island of Cerigotto and Candia; but
  that the sloop passed between Cerigotto and Pauri, and was lost
  on a rock, on the south-west part of that passage, which rock
  does not appear to be laid down in Heather's Chart, by which the
  said sloop was navigated.</p>

  <p>'That no blame attaches to the conduct of Lieutenant <a name=
  "Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>Nesbitt, or such of the surviving
  crew of the Nautilus, but that it appears that Lieutenant Nesbitt
  and the officers and crew did use every exertion that
  circumstances could admit.'</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Nesbitt died in 1824.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_FLORA" id="THE_FLORA"></a>THE FLORA.</h2>

  <p>Early in January, 1807, H.M. ship Flora, of 36 guns, under the
  command of Captain Otway Bland, had been cruizing off the Texel,
  for the purpose of reconnoitring the ships of the enemy. This
  object having been effected, they shaped a course towards
  Harlingen, the captain ordering the pilots not to run the
  slightest risk, but to give the sands of the island sufficient
  berth, so as not to endanger the Flora; and so often did he
  reiterate these instructions, that the pilots appeared hurt that
  their nautical skill and knowledge of the track should be
  doubted. However, to the astonishment of all on board, and to the
  dismay of the pilots, the ship took the ground, and struck on the
  Shelling Reef, about noon on the 18th of January. It was only
  just past high water when she struck, and there was therefore no
  chance of getting her off till the next tide. In the meantime all
  weight was removed from aloft, and the topmasts were lowered over
  the side, to shore her up. Towards evening the wind increased to
  a gale, and a heavy swell came on, which prevented their getting
  out a bower anchor, although a raft was made for the purpose; but
  the night became so dark, and the sea so rough, they were obliged
  to relinquish the attempt, and resolved to wait with patience for
  high water, lightening the vessel as much as possible, <a name=
  "Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>by starting the water, and heaving
  most of the shot and other heavy articles overboard. All hands
  took their turn at the pumps, and worked vigorously; yet the
  water gained rapidly upon the vessel: this was partly
  attributable to her having struck amidships, and having a hole
  through her bottom, instead of her side, to supply the cistern.
  At about nine o'clock P.M., she began to heave, but as the tide
  made, the wind freshened, the sea rose, and she brought home the
  stream anchor, backed by the kedge, and forged on the sand. At
  half-past nine o'clock, a last effort was made to get her off, by
  letting go a bower anchor with a spring abaft, which brought her
  head round. They then made all sail and forced her over the reef.
  The ship once more floated in deep water: but this object was not
  attained without a most serious loss. The rudder had been carried
  away, and with it the launch and the jolly-boat, so that only one
  anchor and the worst boat were left for service. After those
  moments of breathless anxiety, and after giving utterance to a
  short but fervent expression of thankfulness that they had got
  clear of the reef, the men, almost worn out as they were, by so
  many hours of continued labour, again betook themselves to the
  pumps, in hopes of keeping the water under until they could reach
  an English port. But in spite of every exertion, in spite of
  continued bailing and pumping, and though a thrumbed sail was
  under the ship's bottom, the water gained to eight feet. As the
  danger increased, so did the vigour of the men. All was order,
  energy, and steady obedience throughout. The captain perceiving
  that it would be impossible to keep the vessel much longer
  afloat, gave orders to wear ship, and run her on the enemy's
  shore; nor could even this be done without much difficulty and
  danger, as it was necessary to let go their last anchor. Most of
  the guns were now thrown over<a name="Page_109" id=
  "Page_109"></a>board, and everything done to lighten the ship;
  and about half-past six A.M., on the 19th, her head was brought
  round, and, steered by the sails and a cable veered astern,
  towards the islands. The weather was becoming more gloomy and
  threatening, and before ten o'clock A.M. the vessel was so
  terribly shaken, that it became absolutely necessary to cut away
  the main and mizen masts, leaving the foremast standing, with
  sail set, to force the ship on as much as possible, and also to
  prevent her drifting off with the ebb, or with a change of wind.
  Although the dangerous situation of the Flora was clearly
  perceived by the people on shore, no boat put out to her
  assistance, the authorities having forbidden them to render such
  aid on pain of death.</p>

  <p>Captain Bland, during his cruize on these seas, had allowed
  the fishing-boats of the enemy to range unmolested, and had given
  strict orders that not a fish should be taken from them without
  payment; but even these boats now came near the labouring ship
  and passed on, leaving her and her crew to perish. About four
  o'clock in the afternoon when she seemed to be sinking, she took
  the ground and there remained, surrounded by breakers, the crew
  in vain firing guns, and making other signals of distress, which
  were totally disregarded. All hands that could be spared from the
  pumps had been employed in making rafts, and these were now
  launched into the surf, and about one hundred and thirty of the
  crew got upon them, and were fortunate enough to gain the high
  land.</p>

  <p>Captain Bland, with a few officers and men, pushed off in the
  barge, the only boat that was left, and after rowing for eighteen
  hours without any sustenance, they reached the Island of Amoland,
  where they were made prisoners.</p>

  <p>The rest of the crew, who had chosen to stay by the <a name=
  "Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>ship, remained on board for four
  days and nights, and, excepting nine, who perished from the
  severity of the weather, they all got safe on shore. The above is
  a plain, unvarnished account, taken from the narrative of Captain
  Bland: it is a true tale, and needs not the aid of romance to
  give it interest. For more than twenty-four hours the crew
  suffered the horrors of uncertainty; their vessel thrown upon a
  hostile shore, whose inhabitants were forbidden on pain of death
  to assist them, whilst of all their boats one only remained. Yet,
  even during this time of trial and danger, discipline was not for
  a moment abandoned; no man's heart appeared to fail him; each one
  performed his duty with cheerfulness and alacrity; and nobly did
  they all earn the praise bestowed on them by their commander.</p>

  <p>'I cannot help paying here,' said Captain Bland, 'the last
  tribute of praise to my crew; they behaved with order, respect,
  and perfect coolness to the last moment; nor would they quit the
  ship's side in the barge, though at the risk of her being dashed
  to pieces, till I took the place they had reserved for me.'</p>

  <p>The gallantry and seamanship displayed by Captain Otway Bland,
  when in command of the Espoir, 14-gun brig, in his attack and
  subsequent capture of a Genoese pirate, well deserve a place in
  these pages.</p>

  <p>On the 7th of August, 1798, the Espoir was sailing near
  Gibraltar in charge of part of a convoy, when a large vessel,
  which appeared to be a man-of-war, was seen steering apparently
  with the intention of cutting off some of the convoy. Captain
  Bland, notwithstanding the superiority of the force with which he
  had to contend, determined upon attacking the stranger, which
  proved to be the Liguria, mounted with 26 guns of various
  calibres.</p>

  <p>On approaching within hail, an officer on board the Liguria
  ordered the commander of the Espoir to sur<a name="Page_111" id=
  "Page_111"></a>render, or he would sink his ship, enforcing the
  demand by one shot, and afterwards by a whole broadside. The fire
  was returned in a spirited manner by the Espoir, and was kept up
  on both sides by the great guns and musketry for upwards of three
  hours, when the captain of the Liguria hailed the Espoir, begging
  her captain not to fire any more, as he was a Genoese. Upon this,
  Captain Bland desired him to lower his sails, and come on board.
  As no attention was paid to this demand, and the Genoese appeared
  to be attempting some manoeuvre, the Espoir poured in another
  broadside, which the Liguria returned; but on the Espoir tacking
  to fire her opposite broadside, her opponent surrendered.</p>

  <p>The crew of the Liguria consisted, of one hundred and twenty
  men of all nations, whilst that of the Espoir was but eighty men,
  of which the master was killed, and six men wounded.</p>

  <p>Captain Bland died in 1810.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_AJAX" id="THE_AJAX"></a>THE AJAX.</h2>

  <p>On the evening of the 14th of February, 1807, H.M. ship Ajax,
  74 guns, commanded by Captain the Hon. Sir Henry Blackwood, lay
  at anchor off the mouth of the Dardanelles, in company with the
  squadron of Vice-Admiral Sir John Duckworth. The wind, which
  during the day had been boisterous, was partially lulled, and in
  the clear moonlight every object was visible with a distinctness
  almost equal to that of day.</p>

  <p>The scene from the deck of the Ajax was one of surpassing
  beauty and interest. The bright moonbeams <a name="Page_112" id=
  "Page_112"></a>rested on the waters, and left a silvery track
  upon the waves. Ahead and astern, the lofty masts of the squadron
  tapered darkly towards the sky, whilst the outline of every rope
  and spar was sharply defined against the clear blue vault of
  heaven. Every man in the ship, from the commander to the youngest
  boy, could feel and understand this natural beauty; but there
  were many on board the squadron who had still higher enjoyment,
  as they gazed on those isles and shores which recalled the
  classic verse of Homer and of Virgil. For them every island,
  cape, river, and mountain was fraught with interest. There lay
  Tenedos, renowned of old; there the mountain isle of Imbros stood
  out in bold relief from the snow-clad summits of Samothracia. In
  the distance appeared Mount Ida, and at its foot lay stretched
  the plains of Troy, o'er which the 'gulfy Simois' wanders still
  as it did of old. There is Cape Sig&aelig;um, and on it the tomb
  of Patroclus, round which Achilles dragged the godlike Hector's
  corpse; there, too, the ashes of Achilles repose near those of
  his friend; and a little further north, on the Rhoetian
  promontory, is the tomb of 'mighty Ajax.' Homer, Euripides, and
  Virgil have, it is true, a very small share in the studies of a
  youthful sailor, as they do not form an essential ingredient of a
  nautical education; but an English gentleman, although his head
  be crammed with mathematics and equations, always contrives to
  pick up enough of classic lore to enable him thoroughly to enjoy
  such a scene as that we have attempted to describe. He is much to
  be pitied who cannot appreciate such enjoyment; but in these
  days, when the schoolmaster is aboard, and when, by the wise
  liberality of the Government, our ships are furnished with useful
  and interesting books, none need of necessity be deprived of the
  exquisite pleasure which is to be derived from visiting scenes
  which <a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>have been 'dignified
  either by wisdom, bravery, or virtue.' We are constantly reminded
  that 'knowledge is power;' but it might be well to impress upon
  youngsters, that '<i>knowledge</i> is enjoyment.' There is,
  indeed, no acquirement in literature or science that will not at
  some time or other be productive of real pleasure.</p>

  <p>We have lingered on this subject longer than we should have
  done, for we must now relate how soon the tranquillity of that
  fair scene was disturbed&mdash;how for a time another light,
  redder and fiercer than that of the moon, shone on the blue
  waters of the Hellespont.</p>

  <p>Soon after nine o'clock P.M., Captain Blackwood had received
  from his first lieutenant the report of the safety of the Ajax,
  and all, except the officers and men who were on duty, had
  retired to their berths. A very short time, however, had elapsed,
  before the stillness of the night was broken by the appalling cry
  of 'Fire!' It must be a fearful sound to hear&mdash;the cry of
  'Fire!' as awful as the voice of him who</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span>Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,<br /></span>
      <span>And would have told him half his Troy was
      burned.<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The officer of the watch instantly informed Captain Blackwood
  of the alarm. He hastened upon deck, and found too surely that
  flames were bursting from the after-part. He gave orders to beat
  to quarters&mdash;to fire the guns as signals of distress, and
  directed Lieutenant Wood and a midshipman to proceed in one of
  the boats to all the ships of the squadron to request
  assistance.</p>

  <p>These orders were promptly given, and promptly obeyed; but who
  can enter fully into the feelings of Captain Blackwood at that
  awfully critical moment. Here was his ship and six hundred men
  threatened with immediate destruction, and each one of that six
  hundred looked to him for direction and guidance.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>In order to inspire
  others with courage and confidence, he must display decision in
  every look and gesture. Whatever others might do, his lip must
  not tremble, nor his eyelid quiver&mdash;no look of apprehension
  must be seen on his brow. He must stand forth calm and
  undaunted&mdash;the recollection of tender ties and loving hearts
  might wring his soul with agony, but these thoughts must be
  banished; the safety of six hundred human beings depended, under
  God, on his firmness and exertion, and every eye was directed to
  him in anxious inquiry. When the ship's company had turned out,
  every man took his station calmly and in obedience to orders.</p>

  <p>The captain, followed by several of his officers, went down to
  the cockpit, from whence issued clouds of smoke. Every effort was
  made to extinguish the flames in that part of the ship, but they
  increased so rapidly, it soon became impossible for any one to
  remain below. Several of the men who were throwing down water
  fell from suffocation with the buckets in their hands. To give
  more air to the men so employed, the lower-deck ports were hauled
  up; but this rather increasing than diminishing the density of
  the smoke, they were closed again, and the after-hatchway shut
  down. The carpenter's attempt to scuttle the after-part of the
  ship was also ineffectual.</p>

  <p>Ten or fifteen minutes only had elapsed after the first alarm
  had been given, before the flames raged with such fury, that it
  was impossible to hoist out the boats; the jolly-boat had
  fortunately been lowered in obedience to the captain's orders
  when he first went upon deck. As the flames burst up the
  main-hatchway, dividing the fore from the after-part of the ship,
  the captain ordered all hands to the forecastle, and seeing that
  it was utterly beyond human power to prevent the destruction of
  the vessel, he desired every man to provide for his own
  safety.</p>

  <p>The luckless ship was now wrapped in flames from amidships to
  taffrail, and the scene of horror is beyond the powers of
  description. Hundreds of human beings were assembled together on
  the forecastle, bowsprit, and sprit-sail-yard. No boat had yet
  come to their assistance. Their perilous situation had levelled
  all distinction of rank; men and officers were huddled together,
  watching with despairing hearts the progress of the fiery
  element, which threatened to hurry them so quickly into eternity.
  Volumes of black smoke rose in huge pillars from all parts of the
  ship, whilst far above the hissing and crackling of the flames,
  as they ricked the masts and rigging, rose the shrieks and death
  yells of the hapless men, who, unable to gain the forecastle, had
  sought safety aloft, where the flames had now reached them.</p>

  <p>Some, rather than endure the horrible suspense, trusted
  themselves to the mercy of the waves, and by plunging overboard,
  ended their lives and sufferings in a watery grave. Many, in
  their agony, fell on their knees, imploring God for that help
  which they despaired of receiving from mortal agency. Perhaps
  these men would not have thought of prayer to heaven in face of a
  human foe, but now that the 'last enemy' glared upon them in so
  fearful a shape, they felt compelled to fly to Him who hath said,
  'Call upon me in the day of trouble.'</p>

  <p>The booming of the guns, as they exploded, echoed far and wide
  over the waters, and added to the horrors of that awful
  night.</p>

  <p>In the midst of his people stood the captain,
  endeavour<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>ing to sustain
  their sinking spirits, and exhorting them to be firm and to
  depend upon the boats which were now heaving in sight. He then
  bade them farewell, and sprung into the sea; he breasted the
  waves for a length of time, but his strength was nearly
  exhausted, when, happily, he was seen, and picked up by one of
  the boats of the Canopus.</p>

  <p>As the boats from the squadron neared the Ajax, the agonizing
  fears of the sufferers were changed into wild transports of joy;
  so sudden was the transition from despair to hope, that many of
  the crew lost all self-possession, and perished by jumping into
  the sea in their impatience to reach the boats.</p>

  <p>Such details as these, showing the effects of fear upon
  untutored minds, make us thankful that a great change for the
  better has been effected within the last forty years with respect
  to the religious and moral instruction of our sailors.</p>

  <p>Every ship's company is exposed to casualties similar to that
  which befel the crew of the Ajax,&mdash;to shipwreck, fire, and
  sudden destruction,&mdash;and no man will deny that in times of
  extreme peril, a calm and composed mind is the greatest of
  blessings&mdash;the want of it, the greatest misery. Few will be
  sceptical enough to deny, on the other hand, that the best
  security for such composure, in a moment of unforeseen danger, or
  of unlooked-for deliverance, is a firm and sure trust that there
  is a God above, who 'ruleth over all;' whom the winds and the sea
  obey, and who is 'mighty to save,' even in the hour of man's
  direst extremity. To instil this knowledge and trust into the
  hearts of our seamen, and by it to make them both better men, and
  better sailors, should be the chief object of every improvement
  in education.</p>

  <p>Lieut. Willoughby, of the St. George, had hastened in a cutter
  to assist the crew of the Ajax, and he very <a name="Page_117"
  id="Page_117"></a>soon rescued as many men as his boat could
  carry. Numbers, however, were still surrounding him, who, for the
  safety of those in the already overladen boat, were, with much
  reluctance, left to their fate. Fortunately some launches and a
  barge arrived in time to pick them up, and convey them to the
  different ships of the squadron.</p>

  <p>The Ajax all this time was drifting towards the island of
  Tenedos, with her stern and broadside alternately presented to
  the wind. The humane exertions of Lieutenant Willoughby had been
  twice crowned with success; his boat was, for the third time,
  nearly filled with people, when he observed the Ajax round to,
  and that several men were hanging by ropes under her head. He
  resolved, at all hazards, to rescue these poor fellows before she
  again fell off. Dashing, therefore, towards her, he succeeded in
  the first part of his object, but not until the vessel was again
  before the wind, flames issuing from every part of both hull and
  rigging, and with the cutter across her hawse.</p>

  <p>To extricate himself from this perilous situation was almost
  impossible, for every moment increased the speed with which the
  Ajax was surging through the water, and the sea thrown up from
  her bows threatened his small boat with instant destruction.</p>

  <p>We will now take up the account as given by Marshall, in his
  <i>Naval Biograghy</i>:<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id=
  "FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class=
  "fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

  <p>'Whilst the Ajax was propelling the cutter in the above
  alarming manner, the flames reached the shank, painter, and
  stopper, of her remaining bower anchor, and it fell from her
  bows, nearly effecting the destruction of the boat at its first
  plunge into the water. The cable caught her outer gunwale, over
  which it ran, apparently <a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>one
  sheet of fire; orders, exertion, and presence of mind were now of
  no avail. Death to all in the cutter appeared inevitable. The
  sole alternative was either to be burned or drowned, for they
  were all too much exhausted to be able to save themselves by
  swimming.</p>

  <p>'The boats at a distance saw that the cutter was enveloped in
  flames, and therefore considered it impossible to assist her. All
  that Lieutenant Willoughby and his companions could do while the
  cable was running out and binding their boat more firmly to the
  ship, was to keep the sparks and flames as much as possible from
  the uncovered parts of their persons. Providentially, however,
  although the inner portion of the cable had been burnt through,
  the anchor took the ground, and gave the ship's head a check to
  windward, before the less consumed part had entirely left the
  tier; and thus the very event which had seemed to seal the doom
  of the cutter was in all respects ordained by the Almighty for
  her preservation. The change in the ship's position enabled the
  boat to get clear, but not before every individual in her was
  more or less severely scorched, and the heat was no longer
  endurable.'</p>

  <p>The wreck drifted on shore on the north side of the island of
  Tenedos, where, at five o'clock in the morning, she blew up with
  an explosion which might be felt on the adjacent shores of Europe
  and of Asia; and all that remained of the Ajax were a few smoking
  spars, which rose to the surface of the sea.</p>

  <p>Such was the fate of this noble ship, destroyed by a
  conflagration more rapid than had ever been known, and of which
  the cause has never been clearly ascertained. It appears,
  however, certain that, contrary to orders, there had been a light
  in the bread-room; for when the first lieutenant broke open the
  door of the surgeon's cabin, the after bulk-head was already
  burnt down; and <a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>as the
  purser's steward, his assistant, and the cooper, were among the
  missing, it is but reasonable to suppose that the fire had been
  occasioned by their negligence.</p>

  <p>'I trust,' says Captain Blackwood, in his defence before the
  court of inquiry, 'that I shall be able to prove to the
  satisfaction of this court, that I had instituted a regulation,
  which obliged the first lieutenant, the warrant officers, and
  master at arms, in a body to visit all the quarters, store-rooms,
  wings, &amp;c, and report to me at eight o'clock on their
  clearness and safety; and that I had also received at nine
  o'clock the report of the marine officer of the guard.'.... 'I
  trust this court will consider that in ordering the first
  lieutenant and warrant officers to visit all parts of the ship,
  whose report, as well as that of the master at arms, I had
  received at a few minutes past eight o'clock, I had very fully
  provided for every want, and might with perfect confidence have
  considered my ship in a state of perfect safety with respect to
  fire.'</p>

  <p>Captain Blackwood, his surviving officers and men, were all
  most honourably acquitted of any blame respecting the loss of the
  Ajax.</p>

  <p>Out of six hundred men, three hundred and fifty were saved by
  the boats of the squadron; but two hundred and fifty perished
  that night by fire or water.</p>

  <p>Amongst the lost were Lieutenants Reeve and Sibthorpe; Captain
  Boyd, Royal Marines; Mr. Owen, surgeon; Mr. Donaldson, master;
  twenty-five midshipmen; two merchants of Constantinople, and a
  Greek pilot.</p>

  <p>The melancholy fate of the gunner must not be passed over
  unnoticed.</p>

  <p>This poor man had two sons on board, whom he was bringing up
  to his own profession.</p>

  <p>When the first alarm of fire was given, he had rushed below,
  and was soon seen emerging from the smoke with one of the boys in
  his arms.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>He threw the lad into the
  sea and the jolly-boat picked him up; but on going down for the
  other, the unfortunate father fell a victim to his paternal
  affection, and either perished in the flames, or was
  suffocated.</p>

  <p>Of three women who were on board, one saved herself by
  following her husband down a rope from the jib-boom, and was
  received into a boat.</p>

  <p>Captain Blackwood served as a volunteer in the subsequent
  operations of the squadron in forcing the passage of the
  Dardanelles, and his services then were most highly spoken of in
  a letter from Sir J. Duckworth to Lord Collingwood. He had
  distinguished himself on many previous occasions. He was in the
  memorable action of 1st of June, 1794; and he commanded the
  Euryalus at the battle of Trafalgar.</p>

  <p>When Sir Henry Blackwood bade farewell to Nelson, on leaving
  the Victory to repair on board his own ship, before the
  commencement of the action, Lord Nelson said, with prophetic
  meaning, 'God bless you, Blackwood; I shall never see you
  again.'</p>

  <p>In 1810, he commanded the inshore squadron off Toulon, and for
  his gallant conduct on that station he received the thanks of the
  commander-in-chief, Sir Charles Cotton.</p>

  <p>In 1814, Captain Blackwood was advanced to the rank of
  rear-admiral, and in 1819 he was appointed commander-in-chief in
  the East Indies.</p>

  <p>He died a vice-admiral in 1832, and his name is enrolled among
  the first class of naval heroes who have fought under the British
  flag.</p>

  <p>The memory of Blackwood is still held in veneration by the old
  weather-beaten tars of the Nelsonian school.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Willoughby, whom we have seen displaying so much
  gallantry in his efforts to save the crew of the Ajax, entered
  the service in the year 1790.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>Before big promotion to
  the rank of lieutenant, in the year 1798, he distinguished
  himself on more than one occasion by that promptitude of action
  for which his after career was so remarkable.</p>

  <p>In 1801, he served on board the Russel, at the battle of
  Copenhagen. The gallant manner in which he boarded the Provestein
  block ship, excited so much admiration, that the Russel's crew
  gave him three cheers upon his return to the ship. We next find
  this young officer performing a most important service when the
  French forces capitulated at Cape Fran&ccedil;ois, St. Domingo,
  in 1803.</p>

  <p>He was at this period serving on board the Hercule, flag-ship
  to Sir John Duckworth. According to the terms agreed upon, the
  French men-of-war were to keep their colours hoisted until they
  got outside of the harbour, when they were each to discharge a
  broadside in return to a shot fired athwart their bows, by one of
  the British ships, and then to make the usual signals of
  submission.</p>

  <p>The Clorinde frigate, in going out of the harbour, grounded
  under Fort St. Joseph, at the moment when the launch of the
  Hercule, commanded by Mr. Willoughby, was entering the harbour.
  When Mr. Willoughby saw the critical position of the Clorinde,
  and the danger which menaced all on board of her (for he knew
  that even if they succeeded in gaining the shore, which was
  doubtful, no quarter would be given them by the blacks), he
  pulled towards the frigate, and when he came alongside, he
  proposed terms to General La Poyne (who was on board of her) by
  which the safety of the crew would be secured.</p>

  <p>Mr. Willoughby promised, that if the frigate would hoist
  English colours, he (Mr. Willoughby) would wait upon General
  Dessalines, and demand that the British flag should be respected;
  and in the event of the Clorinde going to pieces during the
  night, the crew and passengers should be considered prisoners of
  war.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>General La Poyne readily
  accepted the proposed terms, and accordingly, Mr. Willoughby
  proceeded to negotiate with General Dessalines, who promised
  compliance with his request.</p>

  <p>The boats of the Hercule were sent to the assistance of the
  Clorinde, and they succeeded in heaving her off.</p>

  <p>Thus by the timely exertions of this zealous young officer,
  some hundreds of lives were saved, and the British navy obtained
  a frigate which, for many years, was one of the finest of the
  38-gun class.</p>

  <p>At the attack on Cura&ccedil;oa, in 1804, Mr. James relates,
  that for the sake of encouraging his men, Mr. Willoughby used to
  take his meals sitting in a chair upon the breast-work of a
  battery, while the earth was ploughed up all around; and one man,
  we believe, was killed on the spot; but still the table and
  chair, and the daring officer who sat there, remained
  untouched.</p>

  <p>In the following year, the Hercule had captured a merchant
  schooner, and one of the prisoners gave notice that a Spanish
  corvette of twenty guns, was lying in St. Martha, South America.
  Mr. Willoughby thereupon volunteered to attack her; and on the
  4th of July, he took the command of the prize, and parted company
  with his ship, accompanied by three midshipmen and thirty
  volunteers. On the 6th, they entered the harbour of St. Martha;
  Captain Samuel Roberts, then a midshipman, was at the helm, with
  a check shirt on, his head covered with a French kerchief, and
  his face blackened. The rest of the men were below, except a
  black, and a mulatto.</p>

  <p>The schooner being well known, the deception was perfectly
  successful, and she passed the batteries without interruption;
  but, to the disappointment of all on board, no corvette was to be
  found.</p>

  <p>Mortified in the extreme, they put about, but not in <a name=
  "Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>time to escape detection. The enemy
  had found out the trick that had been played upon them; and the
  batteries from the island and harbour opened upon the schooner a
  volley of no very gentle reproaches. However, she luckily avoided
  the danger, and returned in safety to the Hercule, without
  receiving a single shot.</p>

  <p>In 1807, Mr. Willoughby was appointed to the Royal George. We
  have already alluded to his humane exertions to save the crew of
  the Ajax, while the squadron was off the Dardanelles. He soon
  afterwards received a severe wound whilst he was taking more
  thought for others' safety than for his own. Upon the return of
  the squadron from Constantinople, an attack was made upon a large
  building on the island of Prota.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Willoughby perceiving that three men were very much
  exposed to the enemy's fire, called out to them, desiring them to
  stoop. At that moment, he was himself struck by two pistol balls;
  one entered his head, just above the right jaw, and took a
  slanting direction upwards&mdash;and has never been extracted;
  the other shot cut his left cheek in two; For some minutes he lay
  apparently lifeless, but fortunately the movement of an arm
  indicated enough of life to awaken hope in his companions; and
  they carried him on board the Royal George.</p>

  <p>In 1808, he was promoted to the rank of commander, and
  appointed to the Otter sloop, then employed in cruizing off the
  Isle of France. Here he distinguished himself in cutting out some
  vessels under the protection of the batteries of the Black River;
  and for his services at the capture of St. Paul, he was appointed
  to the Xereide.</p>

  <p>In 1810, he made an attack upon Jacotel: he thought this a
  somewhat dangerous enterprise; and, therefore, to inspire his men
  with more than usual courage and <a name="Page_124" id=
  "Page_124"></a>ardour, he headed them himself, in full uniform.
  After a desperate resistance on the part of the enemy, he
  succeeded in spiking the guns of the fort, and taking prisoner
  the commanding officer. For this service he was promoted to the
  rank of captain.</p>

  <p>In the course of the same year, 1810, a musket burst in the
  hands of one of the men, so near to the place where Captain
  Willoughby stood, that his jaw was fractured, and the windpipe
  laid bare, so that his life was despaired of.</p>

  <p>He had hardly recovered from this wound, before he was engaged
  in an attack upon Port Louis, Isle de France. The disasters which
  befel the squadron upon this occasion have now become a matter of
  history, and they need not be recounted here,&mdash;suffice it to
  say, that Captain Willoughby continued to keep up an unequal
  conflict until nearly all on board the Nereide were either killed
  or wounded. Nor did he surrender, although he had entirely lost
  one of his eyes, and the other was much injured, 'until (to use
  the words of Vice-Admiral Bertie) after a glorious resistance,
  almost unparalleled even in the brilliant annals of the British
  navy,'</p>

  <p>Upon his return to England, Captain Willoughby had a pension
  of 550<i>l</i>. per annum awarded to him in consideration of his
  wounds.</p>

  <p>Having no immediate prospect of employment at home, he
  repaired to St. Petersburg, and offered his services to the
  Czar.</p>

  <p>In his very first engagement in his new career, Captain
  Willoughby was taken prisoner by the French.&mdash;falling a
  victim to his own generosity. During the action, he saw two
  Prussian soldiers severely wounded,&mdash;dismounting himself,
  and desiring his servant to do the same, he placed the wounded
  men upon his own horses, and attended them on foot. They were
  quickly over<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>taken by some
  French cavalry, and Captain Willoughby was made prisoner. He was
  soon afterwards informed that if he would sign a paper, pledging
  himself to hasten to France by a certain route, he would be
  allowed to travel alone.</p>

  <p>He gladly consented to this; but to his astonishment, after
  signing the required paper, he was ordered to march with the
  other prisoners. In vain he protested against this breach of
  faith&mdash;he was obliged to proceed. His sufferings from cold
  and hunger whilst crossing the deserts of Russia and Poland were
  intense. After witnessing the heartrending scenes of Moscow, he
  at length reached Mayence. Thence he was removed to Metz, and he
  had scarcely reached the town, before an order came for his
  confinement in the Chateau of Bouillon, where he remained a close
  prisoner for nine months. He was then taken to Peronne, and there
  he continued until the arrival of the Allies at Chalons, when he
  contrived to make his escape.</p>

  <p>Soon after his arrival in England, Captain Willoughby received
  the Order of the Bath,&mdash;an honour scarcely commensurate with
  the many and valuable services he had performed for his country.
  It may safely be asserted that no officer living has been engaged
  in so many hard-fought actions, or has received so many dangerous
  wounds. From his first entrance into the service, to the end of
  the late war, all his energies were devoted to the service of his
  country; and now that his services are no longer required, with a
  constitution shattered by age and wounds, he is employing the
  remainder of his days in deeds of charity and kindness towards
  his fellow-creatures.</p>

  <p>The year 1807 was most disastrous to the British navy: during
  that period, we lost no less than twenty-nine ships of war, and,
  unhappily, the greater part of their crews. Some of these vessels
  foundered at sea, others were wrecked or accidentally burnt, and
  it was at the close of this eventful year that a calamity
  occurred which equalled, if it did not surpass, any previous
  disaster.</p>

  <p>The Anson, of 40 guns, under the command of Captain Charles
  Lydiard, after completing her stores for a few months' cruise,
  sailed from Falmouth on the 24th of December, to resume her
  station off Brest. The wind was adverse, blowing very hard from
  the W.S.W., until the morning of the 28th, when Captain Lydiard
  made the Island of Bas, on the French coast. As the gale was
  increasing rather than subsiding, he determined to return to
  port, and accordingly shaped his course for the Lizard. At three
  o'clock P.M. land was discovered, apparently about five miles
  west of the Lizard, but owing to the thickness of the fog, there
  was a difference of opinion as to the land that was seen, and
  therefore the ship was wore to stand out to sea. She had not been
  long on this tack before land was descried right ahead.</p>

  <p>It was now evident that their position was extremely
  dangerous,&mdash;the ship was completely embayed, and the wind
  raged with increasing fury. Every exertion was made to keep the
  Anson off shore, but without success, and it was not until she
  was fearfully near to the rocks that she could be brought to an
  anchor, in twenty-five fathoms, with the best bower anchor veered
  away to two cables' <a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>length.
  The top-gallant masts were lowered upon deck, and in this state
  she rode from five o'clock P.M., when she anchored, till four
  o'clock the next morning, when the cable suddenly parted. During
  the night, the gale was tremendous, and the sea ran mountains
  high; they had nothing now to depend upon for the safety of the
  ship but a small bower anchor, which was immediately let go, and
  this held until eight o'clock, when it also parted. The ship was
  no longer an object of consideration; Captain Lydiard felt that
  he had done his utmost to save her, but in vain, and that now
  every energy must be put forth for the preservation of human
  life. The tempest raged with such fury that no boat could
  possibly come to their aid, nor could the strongest swimmer hope
  to gain the shore. It appeared to Captain Lydiard that the only
  chance of escape for any of the crew was in running the ship as
  near the coast as possible. He gave the necessary orders, and the
  master run the vessel on the sand which forms the bar between the
  Loe Pool and the sea, about three miles from Helstone. The tide
  had been ebbing nearly an hour when she took the ground, and she
  broached to, leaving her broadside heeling over, and facing the
  beach.</p>

  <p>The scene of horror and confusion which ensued on, the Anson
  striking against the ground, was one which baffles all
  description. Many of the men were washed away by the tremendous
  sea which swept over the deck; many others were killed by the
  falling of the spars, the crashing sound of which, as they fell
  from aloft, mingled with the shrieks of the women on board, was
  heard even amidst the roar of the waters and the howling of the
  winds. The coast was lined with crowds of spectators, who watched
  with an intense and painful interest the gradual approach of the
  ill-fated vessel towards the shore, and witnessed the subsequent
  melancholy catastrophe.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>Calm and undaunted amidst
  the terrors of the scene, Captain Lydiard is described as
  displacing in a remarkable degree that self-possession and
  passive heroism, which has been so often the proud characteristic
  of the commander of a British ship of war under similar harassing
  circumstances. Notwithstanding the confusion of the scene, his
  voice was heard, and his orders were obeyed with that habitual
  deference which, even in danger and in death, an English seaman
  rarely foils to accord to his commanding officer.</p>

  <p>He was the first to restore order, to assist the wounded, to
  encourage the timid, and to revive expiring hope. Most
  providentially, when the vessel struck, the mainmast, in falling
  overboard, served to form a communication between the ship and
  the shore, and Captain Lydiard was the first to point out this
  circumstance to the crew. Clinging with his arm to the wheel of
  the rudder, in order to prevent his being washed overboard by the
  waves, he continued to encourage one after another as they made
  the perilous attempt to reach the shore. It was fated that this
  gallant officer should not enjoy in this world the reward of his
  humanity and his heroism. After watching with thankfulness the
  escape of many of his men, and having seen with honor many others
  washed off the mast, in their attempts to reach the land, he was
  about to undertake the dangerous passage himself, when he was
  attracted by the cries of a person seemingly in an agony of
  terror. The brave man did not hesitate for a moment, but turned
  and made his way to the place whence the cries proceeded; there
  he found a boy, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his own, whom he had
  entered on board the Anson only a few months before, clinging in
  despair to a part of the wreck, and without either strength or
  courage to make the least effort for his own preservation.
  Captain Lydiard's resolution was instantly <a name="Page_129" id=
  "Page_129"></a>taken,&mdash;he would save the lad, if possible,
  though he might himself perish in the attempt. He threw one arm
  round the boy, whilst he cheered him by words of kind
  encouragement, with the other arm he clung to the spars and mast
  to support himself and his burthen. But the struggle did not last
  long; nature was exhausted by the mental and physical sufferings
  he had endured; he lost his hold, not of the boy, but of the
  mast, the wild waves swept over them, and they perished
  together.</p>

  <p>It must not be supposed that the people on the shore were
  unconcerned spectators of the fearful tragedy that was enacted
  before their eyes. British fishermen are proverbial for their
  daring and intrepidity. Inured from childhood to the dangers and
  hardships attendant on their perilous calling, with very few
  exceptions our fishermen have always been ready to succour the
  wrecked and tempest-tossed mariner. There is not, we believe, a
  fishing village between the Land's End and the Orkneys, that
  cannot produce its true <i>heroes</i>&mdash;men who have risked,
  and are willing again to risk, their own lives to save others.
  Our fisheries are the best nurseries for our navy. Englishmen may
  be justly proud of the boatmen, from amongst whom spring those
  'hearts of oak' which have so long rendered our fleets
  pre-eminent over those of every other country in the world. But,
  besides the generous disposition to assist any perishing fellow
  creature, there were in this instance more powerful motives to
  exert every effort to save the crew of the Anson. This ship had
  been stationed for some time at or near Falmouth, so that
  acquaintances, friendships, and still dearer ties, had been
  formed between the inhabitants of the neighbouring towns and
  villages, and the people of the unfortunate vessel. But a few
  days before they had witnessed a far different scene, when she
  left their shores in all the pride of a well-ordered and
  well-dis<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>ciplined man-of-war,
  amidst the shouts, and cheers, and blessings of the multitude,
  who now beheld her lying within a few fathoms of them a helpless
  wreck, her masts gone, her bulwarks broken in, the waves sweeping
  over her, and breaking up her timbers.</p>

  <p>The surf ran so high, it was impossible that any boat could
  reach the wreck. The life-boat, in 1807, had not been brought to
  the state of perfection it has attained in our day; and the many
  inventions which science and art have since introduced for the
  preservation of life, were for the most part unknown in the times
  of which we are now writing.</p>

  <p>Several men attempted to swim to the ship, but without
  success; they were all, one after another, cast back exhausted
  upon the beach, and many of them without sense or motion. At
  last, when there seemed no hope left of affording aid to the
  sufferers, Mr. Roberts, of Helstone, seized hold of a rope, and
  boldly struck out in the direction of the Anson. He was a
  powerful swimmer, and his courageous efforts were watched from
  the shore and from the wreck with intense interest, and many a
  heartfelt prayer was breathed for his safety and success. Tossed
  on the foaming waters, at one moment lost to sight, and almost
  suffocated in the spray, and at another rising on the top of a
  huge wave, he at last reached the ship, and was hailed as a
  deliverer by those who were still clinging to the spars and
  rigging. The rope which Mr. Roberts had taken with him was made
  fast to the wreck, and this formed a communication with the
  shore, by which many a poor wretch was saved who must otherwise
  have perished.</p>

  <p>Another instance of heroic self-devotion was exhibited by a
  Methodist preacher, a little later in the day, when, as no one
  appeared on the ship's side, it was supposed <a name="Page_131"
  id="Page_131"></a>that every one had either come on shore, or had
  been drowned; but this brave and good mail thought that there
  might be some still left on board who were unable to make an
  effort to save themselves, and, under this impression, he
  ventured his life through the surf, followed by a few other
  daring spirits like himself. With great difficulty they gained
  the wreck, where, as they had anticipated, they found several
  persons lying below, all too much exhausted to get upon deck.
  Some, in terror and despair, called upon God for mercy; others,
  in hopeful trust, seemed resigned to their fate; and others were
  so weak as to be indifferent to the horrors around them. Two
  women and two children were of the number. The preacher and his
  gallant comrades had the happiness of saving the women and some
  of the men, but the children were lost.</p>

  <p>Sixty men, amongst whom were Captain Lydiard and his
  first-lieutenant, perished in the wreck of the Anson. The
  survivors of the crew were conveyed to Helstone, where they
  received every attention and kindness which their unfortunate
  condition required. The body of Captain Lydiard, which was washed
  on shore, was interred at Falmouth with military honours.</p>

<p><br /></p>

  <p>We feel assured that the following particulars of the life of
  Captain Lydiard will not be unacceptable to the reader.</p>

  <p>He entered the navy in the year 1780, in the flag-ship of
  Admiral Darby, who then commanded the channel fleet, and from
  that time served as a midshipman under several commanders on
  various stations, both at home and abroad, during thirteen years.
  In 1794, he was appointed a lieutenant of the Captain, of 74
  guns, in which ship he served in two general engagements in the
  <a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>Mediterranean. In July of
  the following year he removed to the Southampton frigate,
  commanded by Captain Shields, and afterwards by Captain
  Macnamara.</p>

  <p>On the evening of the 9th of June, 1796, the Southampton was
  stationed with the fleet under Sir John Jervis, off Toulon, when
  a French cruizer was discovered working up to Hieres Bay. The
  commander-in-chief called the captain of the Southampton on board
  the Victory, and pointing out the ship, directed him to make a
  dash at her through the Grand Pas. Accordingly, the Southampton
  weighed, and, in order to delude the French into the supposition
  that the ship was either a neutral or a French frigate, hauled up
  under easy sail close to the batteries at the north-east of
  Porquerol. The stratagem succeeded; for before the enemy were
  aware of the approach of the Southampton, the ship was alongside
  of the French cruizer. Captain Macnamara cautioned her commander
  not to make a fruitless resistance; but he replied by snapping
  his pistol, and pouring in a broadside. In a moment, the English
  boarded, led on by Lieutenant Lydiard, with an impetuosity that
  nothing could withstand. After ten minutes' spirited resistance
  on the part of the French captain and a hundred of his men under
  arms, the 'Utile' surrendered, but not before the death of her
  gallant commander, who fell at the beginning of the onset.</p>

  <p>Lydiard was instantly promoted, and appointed to the command
  of the ship he had so gallantly captured. In the year 1801, he
  was advanced to the rank of post-captain, and though frequently
  soliciting employment did not succeed in obtaining a command
  until 1805, when he was appointed to the Anson.</p>

  <p>These pages will not admit of our recounting the many
  instances in which this officer's gallantry was conspicuous.
  Before concluding, however, we cannot refrain <a name="Page_133"
  id="Page_133"></a>from laying before our readers the following
  account of the last enterprise in which Captain Lydiard was
  engaged, and which is related by his biographer in <i>The Naval
  Chronicle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id=
  "FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class=
  "fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <p>'No sooner had the Anson been refitted, than she was again
  selected, with three other frigates, under the command of Captain
  Brisbane (as Commodore), of the Arethusa, to reconnoitre, and, if
  possible, to sound the minds of the inhabitants of Cura&ccedil;oa
  upon the suggestion of an alliance with this country; but the
  gallant Brisbane, and his equally gallant partner in this
  expedition, soon formed a plan for curtailing this mode of
  proceeding, and determined, at all risks, by a <i>coup de
  main</i>, either to capture the island, or to perish in the
  attempt.</p>

  <p>'With this resolution, having arranged their plan of attack,
  they proceeded in their course for the island, and they reached
  the entrance of the harbour just at the dawn of day, on the 1st
  of January, 1807.</p>

  <p>'In order to inform the reader, who may not be acquainted with
  the amazing strength of Cura&ccedil;oa on the sea face, we will
  give some account of the difficulties which they had to contend
  with; and, at the same time, shall avail ourselves of such
  statements of the facts as the different official and other
  communications upon the subject will furnish us with.</p>

  <p>'The harbour was defended by regular fortifications of two
  tier of guns. Fort Amsterdam alone mounting sixty-six pieces of
  cannon; the entrance only fifty yards wide, and so circumstanced,
  that it is impossible for a ship to return by the same wind that
  takes it in. Athwart the entrance of the harbour was the Dutch
  frigate Kenaw Hatslau, of 36 guns, and the Surinam, of 22 guns,
  with <a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>two large schooners of
  war; a chain of forts was on Mesleberg heights, and that almost
  impregnable fortress, Fort Republique, within the distance of
  grape-shot, enfilading the whole harbour. The cool determined
  bravery of British seamen perceives obstacles only to surmount
  them; and with this determination the squadron entered the
  harbour, the Arethusa, Captain Brisbane, leading, followed in
  close line by the Latona, Captain Wood; Anson, Captain Lydiard;
  and Fisguard, Captain Bolton.</p>

  <p>'When the headmost ship got round the point of the harbour's
  mouth, the wind became so unfavourable that she could not fetch
  in; but to return was impossible&mdash;it was too late. What a
  trying moment! At that instant, however, there came on a squall,
  in which the wind shifted two points in their favour, and they
  proceeded close together.</p>

  <p>'The enemy were panic-struck at such unexpected gallantry, and
  all was confusion. A severe and destructive cannonade now
  commenced, and the Dutch frigate was boarded by Captain Brisbane,
  when the Latona instantly warped alongside and took possession,
  and Captain Brisbane proceeded to the shore. The Surinam was
  boarded from the larboard bow of the Anson, while her starboard
  guns were firing at the batteries; and Captain Lydiard, upon
  securing the Surinam, went immediately on shore, and landed at
  the same moment with Captain Brisbane. Immediately debarking
  their respective officers and ship's companies, they proceeded to
  storm the forts, citadel, and town, which were by seven o'clock
  completely in their possession, and at ten o'clock the British
  flag was hoisted on Fort Republique. Captains Brisbane and
  Lydiard were the first upon the walls of Fort Amsterdam. Indeed,
  too much cannot be said in praise of the almost unparalleled
  bravery dis<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>played by the
  officers and men of all the ships on this occasion. It may be
  truly said to be 'perfectly in union with everything glorious in
  the past, and an example of everything glorious to the
  future.''</p>

  <p>The same year that opened so brilliantly upon the career of
  Captain Lydiard, witnessed, at its close, the total destruction
  of the Anson, and the untimely fate of her brave commander.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_BOREAS" id="THE_BOREAS"></a>THE BOREAS.</h2>

  <p>In the afternoon of the 21st of November, 1807, the Boreas, of
  22 guns, Captain George Scott, proceeded in search of a
  pilot-boat, which had been blown off the coast of Guernsey in a
  gale of wind.</p>

  <p>This boat was picked up and taken in tow, when about six
  o'clock P.M. it was discovered that the ship was near the Hannois
  rocks, about two miles to the south-west of Guernsey. Orders were
  immediately given by the pilot to put the helm down, but whilst
  in stays, the ship struck on the larboard bow; and although every
  exertion was made to get her off, it was found impossible to do
  so. The point of a rock was reported to be through the well,
  rendering the pumps useless. The ship then heeled on her larboard
  broadside, and the captain gave orders to cut away the masts.</p>

  <p>The moment the ship struck, the pilots basely deserted her,
  and made off in their own boat, without even offering assistance
  to those who had encountered this danger and disaster in their
  service. Had the pilots returned to Rocquaine, only two miles
  distant, they might have procured aid for the Boreas, and
  preserved the lives of her <a name="Page_136" id=
  "Page_136"></a>crew. When Captain Scott was convinced that there
  was no chance of saving his ship, he ordered an allowance of
  spirits to be served round, and the gig, the launch, and cutter
  to be prepared for lowering.</p>

  <p>The gig, with Lieutenant Bewick, a lieutenant of marines, and
  six men, was sent to give information, and obtain assistance. The
  launch, with the gunner, and some others, was ordered to take on
  board the sick, and land them at Hannois Point, and then to
  return to the ship; and the cutter, with the boatswain, and a few
  men, was despatched on the same service. Captain Scott, with
  noble intrepidity, remained to share the fate of his vessel.</p>

  <p>The launch, under the orders of the gunner, succeeded in
  reaching the Hannois Rocks, as did also the cutter; but the
  greater part of the crew of the launch abandoned her as soon as
  they touched the land. In vain did the gunner use every
  persuasion to induce the men to return with him to the assistance
  of their comrades who were left on board the Boreas; they were
  deaf to his entreaties, and he was obliged to put off again with
  only four men. The wind and tide were so strong, and so much
  against them, that the utmost exertion was necessary to enable
  them to make their way towards the ship, and when they got within
  two hundred yards of the back of the rocks, the launch was half
  filled with water. They then tried to make the land again; but
  before they could reach it the boat was swamped, and the men were
  saved with difficulty by Mr. Simpson, the boatswain, in the
  cutter. There is little doubt that if the launch had not been
  deserted by the greater part of her crew, she might have reached
  the Boreas, and have saved many valuable lives. And here, in
  justice to the majority of the ship's company, we must observe,
  that those who manned the launch were chiefly smugglers and
  privateer's men lately <a name="Page_137" id=
  "Page_137"></a>impressed, and were not to be considered as part
  of the regular crew of the ship.</p>

  <p>In addition to the boats we have already mentioned as having
  left the ship, was a small cutter, (containing two midshipmen, of
  the names of Luttrell and Hemmings, and two men,) which was
  lowered into the sea by order of the first lieutenant, whose
  humanity induced him to take this expedient for saving the lives
  of the two boys. The current was so strong that in a few moments
  the cutter drifted away from the ship, but the generous feelings
  of the boys forbade them to desert their comrades in distress,
  and with great exertion they pulled back to the vessel; they
  called for a rope, but were ordered to keep off, and again their
  little boat was carried away by the current. Once more they
  attempted to get back, but their strength was unequal to the
  task, and they were carried out into the open sea. Their
  situation was in many respects little better than that of the
  friends whom they had left upon the wreck,&mdash;the night was
  pitch dark, the boat had neither mast nor sail, and the sea ran
  so high that they could do nothing with the oars. Every now and
  then the flash of a gun, seen across the black distance, told
  them that the Boreas still held together, and that she was making
  signals of distress; but no sound reached their ears save the
  roar of the winds and the waves. Even the booming of the guns was
  lost in that dismal roar.</p>

  <p>The little party scarcely expected to survive the night; they
  were drenched to the skin, and suffering intensely from the cold;
  the waves broke over the bows of their frail boat, and threatened
  each minute to overwhelm it; but their brave hearts did not sink
  in utter despair; they did their utmost to keep themselves
  afloat, by incessantly baling out the water with their hats and
  hands. They thought the night would never end, <a name="Page_138"
  id="Page_138"></a>and that they should never see the morrow; but
  day dawned upon them at last, and then with what anxious eyes did
  they sweep the horizon. But in vain they looked; not a sail was
  to be seen. An hour passed away; they shipped such a quantity of
  water that their imperfect attempts to bale it out were almost
  useless. The boat sank deeper and deeper, and their hearts sank
  too. Suddenly a ship hove in sight, and she seemed to be bearing
  towards them. Hope and fear struggled for the mastery in their
  breasts; hope urged them to renewed efforts to keep themselves
  from sinking, whilst, in breathless anxiety, they watched the
  vessel. She came nearer and nearer; the watchers felt sure they
  were perceived; then a boat was lowered, and they thanked God for
  their deliverance. In a few minutes they were received on board
  H.M. ship Thalia, more dead than alive, after so many hours'
  endurance of cold, hunger, and dismay.</p>

  <p>We must now return to Captain Scott and his companions on the
  wreck. The men were mustered by the officers on the quarter-deck;
  they numbered ninety-five or ninety-seven, and they had been all
  actively employed in making rafts, and lashing together spars and
  other materials, by which they hoped to save themselves, in the
  event of the ship going to pieces before assistance should
  arrive. Hour after hour passed away, and no help came; by the
  noise of the vessel grinding against the rocks they knew that she
  could not hold together much longer. Captain Scott continued to
  issue his commands with coolness and decision, and they were
  promptly obeyed by both officers and men. About four o'clock in
  the morning, the quarter-deck being no longer tenable, all the
  crew were obliged to betake themselves to the main and mizen
  chains. They had <a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>already
  suffered severely from the cold, but they had now to endure it in
  greater intensity. In their exposed situation the waves
  frequently washed entirely over them, and their limbs were so
  benumbed with cold that it was with the utmost difficulty they
  could hold on to the wreck, so as to save themselves from being
  swept into the abyss of waters that seemed yawning to receive
  them. By degrees, even the cries and the complaints of the
  sufferers became hushed: not a word was spoken; in awful silence
  they listened to the groaning of the timbers, and the sullen roar
  of the waves dashing against the rocks.</p>

  <p>In this state they had remained another hour, when a hollow
  sound was heard below them; still they spoke not a word, for from
  the captain to the youngest boy, every one knew what that sound
  foretold, and that the last struggle was at hand,&mdash;for many,
  the last hour of existence. Then a universal tremor was felt
  through the wreck, and the boldest heart responded to that
  shudder. The very timbers seemed to dread their impending doom:
  with a mighty crash they yielded to the force of the waves; for a
  moment the ship righted, and then sank beneath the foaming
  waters.</p>

  <p>The pen is powerless when we attempt to describe an event like
  this, for we cannot penetrate into the secret recesses of the
  heart, nor can we delineate the agonies of conscience which too
  often increase the anguish of such scenes, when the near approach
  of death unveils to men, truths they have been unwilling to learn
  or to believe. Many a cry for pardon and mercy is raised in the
  hour of shipwreck, from lips that never prayed before. The best
  and bravest then bow their heads in awe, however well they may be
  prepared for the dangers that are incident to their profession;
  and though from childhood 'these men see the works of the Lord,
  and His wonders in the <a name="Page_140" id=
  "Page_140"></a>deep,' yet it must be an appalling moment when the
  plank they have been wont to tread in calm security, is torn from
  beneath their feet, and they are left as helpless as infants, to
  be the sport of the wild billows!</p>

  <p>The moment the vessel sunk, many of the men struck out for the
  plank nearest to them; a few of the strongest and best swimmers
  gained the raft, but others who were benumbed with cold, or
  otherwise unable to swim, perished immediately. The
  quarter-master was one of those who reached the raft, and he
  found the captain, the doctor, and some others, already upon it.
  Captain Scott was so much exhausted by the mental and bodily
  sufferings he had endured, that the doctor and the quarter-master
  were obliged to support him on the raft. He became gradually
  weaker, and lingered but a short time ere he expired in their
  arms; and a few minutes afterwards a huge wave swept over the
  raft, and bore with it the body of the lamented commander of the
  Boreas. About eight o'clock in the morning, a number of boats put
  out from Guernsey to the relief of the survivors, and carried
  them safely on shore.</p>

  <p>We have already mentioned the cowardly and inhuman conduct of
  the pilots in deserting the Boreas, and it is also a matter of
  surprise, that although twenty guns were fired as signals, and
  several rockets and blue lights burned, no help of any kind was
  sent from the shore till the next morning. One of the witnesses
  on the court-martial affirmed, that a pilot on shore had heard
  the guns firing, and had inquired of a soldier on guard whether
  it was an English or French man-of-war! On the soldier replying
  that he thought it was an English vessel, the man refused to put
  to sea, saying, by way of excuse, that 'it blew too hard.'</p>

  <p>Through the exertions of Lieut. Colonel Sir Thomas Saumarez,
  about thirty seamen and marines were taken <a name="Page_141" id=
  "Page_141"></a>off the rocks of the Hannois at daylight, making
  the entire number saved about sixty-eight; whilst the loss
  amounted to one hundred and twenty-seven.</p>

  <p>The following is an extract from the dispatch of Vice-Admiral
  Sir James Saumarez:&mdash;'The greatest praise appears due to
  Captain Scott and his officers and men, under such perilous
  circumstances&mdash;in a dark and tempestuous night, in the midst
  of the most dangerous rocks that can be conceived, and I have
  most sincerely to lament the loss of so many brave officers and
  men, who have perished on this melancholy occasion.</p>

  <p>'Captain Scott has been long upon this station, and has always
  shown the greatest zeal and attachment to his Majesty's service,
  and in him particularly his country meets a great loss, being a
  most valuable and deserving officer.'</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_HIRONDELLE" id="THE_HIRONDELLE"></a>THE
  HIRONDELLE.</h2>

  <p>The Hirondelle, a 14-gun brig, had been originally a French
  privateer. She was taken by the boats of the Tartar in the year
  1804, when attempting to escape from that vessel through a narrow
  and intricate channel between the islands of Saona and St.
  Domingo. The Tartar finding from the depth of the water that she
  could not come up with the schooner, despatched three of her
  boats under the command of Lieutenant Henry Muller, assisted by
  Lieutenant Nicholas Lockyer and several midshipmen, all
  volunteers, to endeavour to bring her out. The instant the boats
  put off, the Hirondelle hoisted her colours, fired a gun, and
  warped <a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>her broadside towards
  them. As they advanced, the privateer opened a fire from her
  great guns, and as they drew nearer, from her small arms also. In
  spite of this, and of a strong breeze directly on the bows of the
  boats, Lieutenant Muller intrepidly pulled up to the privateer,
  and after a short but obstinate resistance, he boarded and
  carried her, with the loss only of one seaman, and one marine
  wounded.'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id=
  "FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class=
  "fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p>Such was the first introduction of the Hirondelle into the
  British navy. Her career in it was of short duration, and its
  conclusion fearfully sudden and disastrous, as the following
  account, given by the survivors, will show.</p>

  <p>On the 22nd of February, 1808, the Hirondelle, commanded by
  Lieutenant Joseph Kidd, sailed from Malta, bound to Tunis, with
  dispatches on board. On Wednesday evening they steered a course
  towards Cape Bon, but unfortunately they got within the action of
  the strong current that sets eastward along the Barbary Coast, so
  that, instead of making the Cape as she intended, the brig fell
  some few leagues short of it to the eastward, and run aground. As
  soon as the alarm was given, all hands were turned up; the night
  was so dark it was impossible to ascertain the exact position of
  the ship, but they distinctly heard the breakers on the shore.
  Every effort was made to bring the vessel up, by endeavouring to
  anchor, but without effect; while this was going on, the cutter
  had been manned with ten or twelve men, and she might have been
  the means of saving many lives, but she was no sooner lowered,
  than the people rushed into her in such numbers that she was
  almost immediately swamped, and all who were on board her
  perished, except one man, who regained the deck of the
  Hirondelle. The commander now saw that the loss <a name=
  "Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>of his ship was inevitable, and he
  therefore desired his crew to provide for their own safety. The
  order was scarcely uttered, no one had had time to act upon it,
  when suddenly the brig gave a lurch and went down; the sea washed
  over her, and of all her men, four only were left to tell the sad
  tale. Happily for them they were clinging to the wreck, and so
  escaped the fate of their companions who were swept overboard;
  and by aid of some of the spars they succeeded in gaining the
  shore.</p>

  <p>This account is necessarily brief: so short a time elapsed
  between the unexpected striking of the ship and her going to
  pieces, that there is no incident to relate. The commander and
  officers of the Hirondelle seem to have done all in their power
  to extricate her from her unfortunate position; indeed, it would
  appear that had they attended less anxiously to the preservation
  of the ship, many lives might have been saved.</p>

  <h2><a name="BANTERER" id="BANTERER"></a>BANTERER.</h2>

  <p>His Majesty's ship Banterer, of 22 guns, under the command of
  Captain Alexander Shephard, was lost on the 29th October, 1808,
  between Port Neuf and Point Mille Vache, in the River St.
  Lawrence, whilst in the execution of orders, which Captain
  Shephard had received from Sir John Borlase Warren, directing him
  to proceed to Quebec, with all possible despatch, to take a
  convoy to England.</p>

  <p>The following is the account of this disastrous affair, as
  given by Captain Shephard:&mdash;</p>

  <p><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>'Being as far as the
  Island of Bie in pursuance of orders, through rather an intricate
  navigation, with foul winds the greater part of the time, where
  the charge of the ship devolved upon myself, and the only chart I
  could procure of the navigation in question being on a very small
  scale, I felt myself relieved from much anxiety by receiving a
  branch pilot on board on the 28th October last, on which night at
  eight P.M. we passed between that island and the south shore,
  with the wind north by west, and very fine weather; at nine, the
  wind coming more round to the westward, we tacked for the north
  shore, in order, as the pilot said, not only to be ready to avail
  himself of the prevailing northerly winds in the morning, but
  because the current was there more in our favour. At midnight we
  tacked to the southward, and at two A.M. again laid her head to
  the northward; and at four A.M. the pilot having expressed a wish
  to go about, the helm was accordingly put down, and on rising
  tacks and sheet, it was discovered that the ship was aground. As
  we had then a light breeze at west, the sails were all laid
  aback, the land being in sight from the starboard-beam,
  apparently at some distance, I immediately ordered the master to
  sound round the ship, and finding that the shoal lay on the
  starboard quarter and astern, ordered the sails to be furled, the
  boats hoisted out, the stream anchor and cable to be got into the
  launch, and the boats to tow her out two cables' length,
  south-west from the ship, where we found the deepest water; but
  by this time the wind had suddenly increased to such a degree
  that the boats could not row ahead, and latterly having lost our
  ground, we were obliged to let the anchor go in fifteen fathoms,
  about a cable's length W.S.W. from the ship, on which, having got
  the end of the cable on board, we hove occasionally as the flood
  made, and in the meantime got our spare topmasts over <a name=
  "Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>the side, with the intention of
  making a raft to carry out a bower anchor should it moderate; but
  the intense cold, and the still increasing gale rendered it
  impossible.</p>

  <p>'About half-past eleven A.M. the stream cable being then taut
  ahead, the wind W.S.W., with a very heavy sea, the ship canted
  suddenly with her head to the southward, where we had deep water;
  we immediately set our courses, jib and driver, and for some time
  had the must sanguine hopes of getting her off, but were
  unfortunately disappointed, and as the ebb made we were obliged
  again to furl sails.</p>

  <p>'As the ship was then striking very hard, with a heavy sea
  breaking over her in a body, we cut away the topmasts, not only
  to ease her, but to prevent their falling upon deck; we also
  endeavoured to shore up the ship, but the motion was so violent
  that four and six parts of a five-inch hawser were repeatedly
  snapped, with which we were lashing the topmasts as shores,
  through the main-deck ports. At about eight P.M., fearing the
  inevitable loss of the ship, as the water was then gaining on the
  pumps, I availed myself of the first favourable moment to land
  the sick, and a party of marines and boys with some
  provisions,&mdash;this could only be effected at a certain time
  of tide, even with the wind off shore,&mdash;and employed those
  on board in getting upon deck what bread and other provisions
  could be come at.</p>

  <p>'Though the water was still gaining on the pumps as the flood
  made, the wind coming more round to the northward, we again set
  our foresail, but without the desired effect. As the stream
  anchor had, however, come home, the wind was too doubtful to
  attempt to lighten the ship.</p>

  <p>'On the morning of the 30th, it being moderate, with the wind
  off shore, we hove our guns, shot, and everything that could
  lighten the ship, overboard, reserving <a name="Page_146" id=
  "Page_146"></a>two on the forecastle for signals. As the flood
  made, we again set what sail we could, and hove on the stream
  cable,&mdash;though, with all hands at the pumps, we found the
  water increase in the hold as it flowed alongside; and it was the
  prevailing opinion that the ship would have foundered if got off.
  Being now convinced, from concurring circumstances, as well as
  the repeated representations of the carpenter, that the ship
  could not swim, the water having flowed above the orlop deck, and
  much sand coming up with the pumps, we desisted from further
  attempts to get her off the shoal, and continued getting such
  stores and provisions as we could upon deck.</p>

  <p>'Towards the afternoon, the wind again increasing from the
  W.S.W., and the water being on the lower deck, I judged it proper
  to send some provisions, with such men as could be best spared,
  on shore, that, in the event of the ship going to pieces, which
  was expected, the boats might be the better able to save those
  remaining on board; and on the morning of the 31st, conceiving
  every further effort for the preservation of the ship unavailing,
  it then blowing strong, with every appearance of increasing, I
  felt myself called on, by humanity as well as duty to my country,
  to use every effort in saving the lives of the people intrusted
  to my care, and accordingly directed the boats to land as many of
  them as possible, keeping the senior lieutenant and a few others
  on board with me.</p>

  <p>'The whole of this day there was little prospect of saving
  those who remained with the wreck, as the surf was so great that
  the boats could not return to us; several guns were fired, to
  point to those on shore our hopeless situation, and stimulate
  them to use every possible effort to come to our relief; but they
  could not effect it, notwithstanding every exertion on their
  part, which we were most anxiously observing. As the only
  <a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>means which then occurred to
  me of saving the people on board, I directed a raft to be made
  with the spars left on the booms, which was accomplished, with
  much difficulty, in about six hours; the sea then breaking over
  the ship with great violence, and freezing as it fell with such
  severity, that even the alternative adopted presented little
  prospect of saving any one left on the wreck. During this state
  of awful suspense, we had every reason to think that the ship was
  completely bilged, and were apprehensive, from the steepness of
  the bank, that she would fall with her decks to the lee, as the
  ebb made, in which case all on board must have inevitably
  perished.</p>

  <p>'About half-past eleven P.M., the barge came off; and as the
  lives of the people were now the primary consideration, I sent as
  many of them on shore by her as possible, as well as by the
  launch, when she was able to come off; and at two A.M., on the
  1st November, having previously succeeded in sending every other
  person on shore, I left the ship with regret, in the jolly boat,
  and landed, with some difficulty, through the surf. About eight
  A.M., the same morning, I attempted to go off in the barge to
  save as much provisions and stores as possible, but found it
  impracticable, as the boat was nearly swamped. All this and the
  succeeding day, the gale continuing, we could not launch the
  boats, and were employed carrying such provisions and stores as
  were saved, to some empty houses which were discovered about six
  miles to the eastward of where we landed. Finding that with all
  our exertions we had only been able to save three days' bread,
  the officers and crew were put upon half allowances, with the
  melancholy prospect of starving in the woods.</p>

  <p>'On Thursday, the 3rd November, the weather moderating, we
  launched the boats before daylight, and dispatched the jolly
  boat, with the purser, to a village <a name="Page_148" id=
  "Page_148"></a>called Trois Pistoles, about forty-five miles
  distant, on the opposite side of the river, that he might find
  his way to Quebec, to procure us assistance and relief, there
  being no possibility of communicating with any inhabited quarter
  from where we were but by water.</p>

  <p>'During our stay near the wreck, we had repeated gales of
  wind, both to the eastward and westward; and so violent, and with
  so much sea, that the mizenmast was thrown overboard, all the
  upper deck beams broken, and the ship's bottom beaten out.</p>

  <p>'We embraced every intervening opportunity of going off to
  save stores by scuttling the decks, which were covered with ice,
  the ship on her broadside, and the water flowing over the
  quarter-deck. On these occasions we were generally away ten or
  twelve hours, exposed to the wet and cold, without nourishment;
  from which, and fatigue, I had to lament seeing the people every
  day become more sickly, and many of them frost-bitten from the
  severity of the weather. By the indefatigable exertions of the
  officers and crew, we succeeded in saving all our spare sails,
  cables, and stores, to a considerable amount; though the cables
  were frozen so hard, that we were obliged to cut and saw them as
  junk.</p>

  <p>'On the 7th, I again sent a boat with the second lieutenant,
  to Trois Pistoles, in the hope of procuring, if possible, some
  temporary supplies; but the wind increasing to a violent gale
  from the eastward, with a heavy fall of snow, they got frozen up
  on the opposite shore, and did not return till the 12th, having
  then only procured three hundred weight of flour, a few potatoes,
  and some beef&mdash;two men having deserted from the boat.</p>

  <p>'At this period, I had a respectful request made me from the
  people, to be allowed to go to Trois Pistoles, that they might
  shift for themselves whilst the weather <a name="Page_149" id=
  "Page_149"></a>would admit of it, dreading the consequences of
  remaining longer where we were; but out boats would not have
  carried above one-third, and I conceived the public service would
  have suffered from allowing them to separate. We had, also,
  several desertions&mdash;in consequence, I believe, of hunger,
  and the melancholy prospect before them; two of the deserters
  were brought back, and one returned delirious, after five days'
  absence, with his feet in a state of gangrene, having had only
  one small cake to eat during that time. Those still missing must
  have perished in the woods, from the accounts of the men who were
  brought back.</p>

  <p>'On Sunday, the 20th November, we were relieved from the most
  painful state of anxiety by the arrival of a small schooner, with
  a fortnight's provisions, from Quebec, and information that a
  transport had been procured, and was equipping for us, which
  nothing but the ice setting in would prevent coming down; and on
  the 24th I had the satisfaction of receiving a letter by the
  government schooner, announcing a further supply of provisions,
  with some blankets for the people; it, however, then blew so
  hard, with a heavy fall of snow, that she was obliged to take
  shelter under Bie. On the 25th the schooner returned, when we
  embarked, and were carried to the opposite side of the river,
  where the transport was expected,&mdash;the pilot conceiving it
  unsafe to bring the ship nearer to us at that season of the
  year.'</p>

  <p>'Captain Shephard concludes his narrative in paying the
  following tribute to the discipline and good conduct of his
  crew:&mdash;</p>

  <p>In justice to the officers and crew, it now becomes my duty,
  and a very pleasing part thereof, to bear testimony to the
  particular perseverance with which they bore the cold, hunger,
  and fatigue, whilst endeavouring to save the ship; and when that
  idea was given up, in <a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>saving
  the stores with the dire prospect before them of being cut off
  from all supplies had the winter set in, the ice rendering all
  communication impracticable during that season of the year.'</p>

  <p>The sufferings and privations endured by the officers and crew
  of the Banterer, during such trying circumstances, have been ably
  described in the above narrative of Captain Shephard. From the
  29th of October, to the 24th of November, a period of
  twenty-seven days, these men, with little hopes of succour, had
  borne, with almost unexampled fortitude, not only hunger and
  cold, but, to use the words of the surgeon, 'a considerable
  number of the crew were affected with inflammation of the
  extremities, which in nearly twenty cases produced partial
  mortification, and one extensive gangrene on both feet, attended
  with delirium and other dangerous symptoms.'</p>

  <p>Captain Shephard died, as rear-admiral, in 1841.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_CRESCENT" id="THE_CRESCENT"></a>THE
  CRESCENT.</h2>

  <p>His Majesty's Ship Crescent, of 36 guns, Captain John Temple,
  sailed from Yarmouth about four o'clock in the afternoon of the
  29th of November, 1808, for Gottenburg. When she left Yarmouth,
  the wind blew fresh from the south-west, and it continued
  favourable till the following afternoon, when the weather became
  overcast, and the wind increased to a gale. The vessel proceeded
  on her course for some days, and at daylight, on the 5th of
  December, the coast of Norway was discernible from the deck. At
  one o'clock, P.M., they sounded in twenty-five fathoms, on the
  coast of Jutland; an hour later they sounded in eighteen fathoms,
  <a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>and at three o'clock they
  were in thirteen fathoms. The pilots in charge of the Crescent
  requested the master to inform Captain Temple that they desired
  that the ship should be hove to, with her head to the southward,
  and the topsails close reefed. The advice of the pilots was
  immediately acted upon, and they at the same time assured the
  captain that they were well acquainted with the soundings, and
  they had no doubt the ship would drift with safety. Suddenly she
  did drift into ten fathoms, and remained in that depth until
  eight o'clock, P.M.</p>

  <p>Captain Temple felt anxious for the safety of his ship and her
  crew, and he inquired of the pilots if any alteration could be
  made with advantage. They replied that none was necessary; but
  that the Crescent should be kept on the same tack till daylight.
  The vessel drifted till ten o'clock, P.M. when she struck. A boat
  was immediately lowered to sound. The men reported the current
  setting to eastward at the rate of two and a-half or three miles
  an hour.</p>

  <p>As the sails were now only forcing the ship further on the
  shoal, orders were given to furl, and to hoist out all the boats
  except the jolly-boat and gig&mdash;both of these orders were
  promptly obeyed. At this time, the current was taking the ship on
  the larboard bow, and canting her round. In order to draw her
  off, the sails were loosed; but this, instead of having the
  desired effect, hove her round into a worse position than before.
  The sails were again furled, and an anchor and cable were got
  into the launch. The boats then took the launch in tow, and
  endeavoured to pull her out; but the force and rapidity of the
  current rendered it impossible to do so. The situation of the
  Crescent became every instant more perilous; the gale had
  increased, and the wind, which had veered round to the
  north-west, blew direct <a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>on
  shore, forcing the vessel further on the shoal. As a last attempt
  to save the ship, the captain directed that the bower anchor
  should be let go, and the ship lightened by heaving the guns,
  shot, balls, &amp;c., overboard. Little good resulted from this
  step; and then the water was started and the provisions thrown
  overboard out of the fore and aft holds. Pumping now became
  useless, as the water had risen to the hatches; and when at last
  the cable parted, all hopes of saving the vessel were abandoned,
  and at half-past six in the morning of the 6th of December the
  masts were cut away by the captain's orders, and she lay a
  helpless wreck. The boats which, until this time, had been lying
  off in tow, broke their hawsers; and when the people on board
  found it impossible to regain the ship, from the force of the
  current, they made for the shore, and fortunately all succeeded
  in reaching it, with the exception of one of the cutters, which
  was lost with all her crew. Lieutenant Henry Stokes, who was in
  one of the other boats, fearing that she would be capsized,
  jumped overboard, and attempted to swim on shore, but had not
  strength to buffet with the waves, and was drowned. The storm
  continued to increase as the day advanced, and the men on board
  the wreck being completely exhausted, they piped to breakfast,
  and a dram was served round. At one o'clock, P.M., a raft was
  commenced, and in about an hour it was completed and launched,
  and placed under the charge of Lieutenant John Weaver, of the
  Marines, Mr. Thomas Mason, clerk, and Mr. James Lavender,
  midshipman. The crew of the raft was composed chiefly of the
  sick, or those least capable of exerting themselves for their own
  preservation. When the raft left the ship, the captain and
  gallant crew of the Crescent gave three hearty cheers to their
  companions, whom they were never likely to behold again. It is
  hard to say which of <a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>the
  parties was in greatest peril, or nearest to destruction; but in
  all such cases, those who are obliged to wait for the awful
  moment, are subjected to more intense mental suffering than those
  who act, and are enabled to take any measures, however perilous,
  for saving their lives. The people upon the raft returned the
  farewell cheer, and as each wave dashed over them, and they again
  floated on the surface, they announced their safety with another
  and another shout. They had little hope indeed of reaching the
  shore alive; they were standing up to their middle in water, and
  every billow that rolled over them carried away one or more of
  their number. Happily some of those who were washed off the raft,
  succeeded in regaining it; but seven of them perished, the rest
  were safely landed, and to the constant exertions of the officers
  to keep up the spirits of the men, they were greatly indebted for
  their preservation.</p>

  <p>A second raft was begun on board the Crescent, but it was
  never completed; the sea made a clear breach over her; the
  quarter-deck became filled with water, and it was therefore
  necessary to launch the jolly-boat in order to save as many lives
  as possible, though she could scarcely be expected to live in
  such a sea. Once more, Captain Temple and above two hundred men
  and officers said farewell to the companions of their toils and
  dangers&mdash;once more they bade God speed to the frail
  bark&mdash;their own last chance of escape&mdash;and watched it
  as it was now borne aloft on the crested wave, now buried in the
  briny furrow. For a time they forgot their own danger in anxiety
  for the others; but they were soon recalled to what was passing
  around them&mdash;the groaning of the timbers, as every sea
  struck the wreck with an increasing shock, forewarned them that
  she could not long resist that mighty force. There were two
  hundred and twenty human beings entirely helpless to save
  themselves. <a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>None may know
  the agonies of that hour, when even hope itself had
  fled&mdash;when nothing intervened between the soul and the
  unseen world. The Crescent went to pieces a short time after the
  departure of the jolly-boat, and every one left on board
  perished, to the number of two hundred and twenty, out of a crew
  of two hundred and eighty. Amongst the lost were the captain,
  three lieutenants, a lieutenant of marines, nine midshipmen, the
  surgeon, purser, carpenter, and gunner; two pilots, one
  passenger, six women, and a child.</p>

  <p>The surviving officers and crew of the Crescent were tried by
  a court martial, at Sheerness, for the loss of the vessel, when
  the court was of opinion that 'the loss of the Crescent proceeded
  from the ignorance and neglect of the pilots, and that the master
  was blameable, inasmuch that he did not recommend to the captain
  or pilots either coming to an anchor, or standing on the other
  tact, for the better security of H.M. late ship Crescent.'</p>

  <p>'The court was further of opinion that every exertion was made
  on the part of the remaining officers and crew for the safety of
  the Crescent.'</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_MINOTAUR" id="THE_MINOTAUR"></a>THE
  MINOTAUR.</h2>

  <p>His Majesty's Ship Minotaur, of 74 guns, Captain John Barrett,
  was ordered by Admiral Sir James Saumarez to protect the last
  Baltic fleet, in the year 1810.</p>

  <p>After seeing the convoy through the Belt, the ship sailed from
  Gottenburg about the 15th December, and, with a strong breeze
  from the east, shaped her course alone for the Downs.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>At eight o'clock, in the
  evening of the 22nd, Lieutenant Robert Snell took charge of the
  watch; the wind was then blowing hard from the south-east, the
  weather thick and hazy, and the ship, under close-reefed
  topsails, and courses, was going at the rate of four knots an
  hour.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock, the captain gave orders that soundings should
  be taken every hour, under the immediate direction of the pilot
  of the watch. At midnight, the pilot desired that the vessel
  might be put on the other tack, and all hands were instantly
  turned up to carry out his directions, and Lieutenant Snell was
  in the act of informing the captain of what was going on, when
  the ship struck.</p>

  <p>The helm was ordered to be put up, but the first shock had
  carried away the tiller; fruitless attempts were then made to
  back the ship off, but she had struck with such force upon the
  sand that it was impossible to move her. The carpenter now
  reported fifteen feet water in the hold; and it increased so
  rapidly that in a few minutes it rose above the orlop deck. The
  officers and the whole of the ship's company were assembled upon
  deck, and the universal question passed from mouth to
  mouth&mdash;'On what coast have we struck?'</p>

  <p>The pilot of the watch maintained that they were on some shoal
  in the English coast; the other pilot, however, was of opinion
  that they were upon the North Haacks, and this proved to be
  actually the case.</p>

  <p>For a few minutes after the ship first struck there was some
  degree of confusion on board; but this soon subsided; order and
  tranquillity were restored, and the men all exerted themselves to
  the utmost, although she struck the ground so heavily, it was
  almost impossible for them to keep their feet.</p>

  <p>The masts were cut away, and other means taken to lighten the
  ship; and guns were fired as signals of <a name="Page_156" id=
  "Page_156"></a>distress, but no aid was afforded to them during
  that long and dismal night. The darkness was so intense, it was
  impossible to see beyond a few yards, and they could only judge
  of their proximity to land, by the sullen roar of the breakers as
  they dashed upon the shore. In this state of uncertainty and
  dread, the night passed away; and daylight at last discovered to
  the crew of the Minotaur the horrors of their situation. The ship
  was firmly imbedded in sand, and had gradually sunk till the
  water covered the forecastle. All the boats excepting the launch
  and two yauls were destroyed, either by the falling of the masts,
  or the waves breaking over them.</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock, A.M., the Minotaur parted amidships, and the
  sea made a clear breach over her. The gunner, seeing that she
  could not hold together much longer, volunteered to go off in the
  yard, and endeavour to obtain assistance from the shore. Captain
  Barrett at first refused the offer, as he thought it impossible
  the boat could live in such a sea; but upon further
  consideration, he gave his consent; and the gunner, with
  thirty-one of the crew, succeeded in launching the yaul, and
  getting clear of the wreck.</p>

  <p>The ship now presented a most distressing scene&mdash;portions
  of her timbers and spars were floating about in all directions,
  with casks of spirits and provisions which had been washed up
  from the hold. Crowded together on the poop and the quarter-deck
  were officers and men watching with eager anxiety the progress of
  the boat. After two hours of breathless suspense they saw her
  reach the shore. Their comrades' success was hailed with joy by
  the shipwrecked crew as a happy omen for themselves&mdash;it
  inspired them with hope and confidence, and some of them
  immediately attempted to lift the launch into the sea. They
  fortunately succeeded in getting her afloat, and numbers then
  rushed to get <a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>into her,
  amongst whom was Lieutenant Snell. He failed in his first
  attempt, and then swam to the foretop, near which he knew the
  launch must pass, to enable her to clear the wreck. He watched
  his opportunity, and when the boat approached, jumped into the
  sea, and was taken on board.</p>

  <p>In the course of an hour, the launch gained the shore, where,
  instead of receiving the assistance they expected, and the
  kindness their unfortunate circumstances demanded, the crew were
  met by a party of French soldiers, and immediately made
  prisoners. In vain, they implored the Dutch officers, who were
  also on the beach, to send boats to the aid of their unhappy
  comrades on the wreck, their earnest entreaties were met by a
  cold refusal.</p>

  <p>During the morning, Captain Barrett, and about a hundred men,
  attempted to reach the shore in the second yaul, but she was
  swamped and all were lost. At two o'clock in the afternoon, the
  after-part of the ship turned bottom up, and the remainder of the
  crew perished.</p>

  <p>The fate of Lieutenant Salsford was distinguished by a
  singular circumstance. A large tame wolf, caught at Aspro, and
  brought up from a cub by the ship's company, and exceedingly
  docile, continued to the last an object of general solicitude.
  Sensible of its danger, its howls were peculiarly distressing. It
  had always been a particular favourite of the lieutenant, who was
  also greatly attached to the animal, and through the whole of
  their sufferings kept close to his master. On the breaking up of
  the ship both got upon the mast. At times they were washed off,
  but by each other's assistance regained it. The lieutenant at
  last, became exhausted by continual exertions, and benumbed, with
  cold. The wolf was equally fatigued, and both held occasionally
  by the other to retain his situation. When within a short
  distance of <a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>the land,
  Lieutenant Salsford, affected by the attachment of the animal,
  and totally unable any longer to support himself, turned towards
  him from the mast, the beast clapped his fore paws round his
  neck, while the lieutenant clasped him in his arms, and they sank
  together.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id=
  "FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class=
  "fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  <p>Such was the fate of the Minotaur, her captain, and four
  hundred of her crew. There is not the slightest doubt but that,
  had the Dutch sent assistance, the greater part of the ship's
  company would have been saved; and it would appear by the
  following extract from a letter, written on the subject by
  Lieutenant Snell, that the risk attending such a humane attempt,
  on the part of the Dutch, would not have been great. Lieutenant
  Snell says:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'The launch which had brought on shore eighty-five men, was of
  the smallest description of 74 launches, with one gunwale
  entirely broken in, and without a rudder. This will better prove
  than anything I can say how easy it would have been for the Dutch
  admiral in the Texel to have saved, or to have shown some wish to
  have saved, the remaining part of the crew.'</p>

  <p>On the other hand, we have the report from the chief officer
  of the marine district of the North coast, addressed to the
  Minister of Marine, in which he states, that 'Captain Musquetie,
  commander in the Texel Roads, sent, at daylight on the 23rd, two
  boats to reconnoitre the Minotaur, but the wind and sea prevented
  them approaching the vessel.'</p>

  <p>It is to be hoped, for the honour of the Dutch officers, that
  they <i>did</i> really put out to the relief of the Minotaur, and
  that they considered the attempt an impossibility, which a
  British sailor deemed one of little risk. It is evident that
  there must have been considerable danger <a name="Page_159" id=
  "Page_159"></a>for boats, from the fact of the second yaul being
  lost, and Captain Barrett's hesitation before he allowed the
  gunner to leave the ship in the first yaul; and in charity we
  must give the Dutch the benefit of this evidence. At the same
  time, we have the equally conclusive testimony of the safe
  landing of two boats from the Minotaur, that it was not
  'impossible' for even a somewhat crazy boat to live on such a
  sea. At daylight, on the 24th, the survivors of the Minotaur's
  crew were marched off as prisoners to Valenciennes. From which
  place, the gunner, Mr. Bones, contrived to make his escape on the
  3rd of February. After suffering the greatest privations,
  concealing himself in barns and stables by day, and travelling by
  night, on the 17th of March he got on board a smuggling lugger,
  about a mile from Ostend, the Master of which agreed to land him
  in England for the sum of &pound;50.</p>

 <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <p class="c">NOTE BY A NAVAL FRIEND.</p>

  <p>The loss of the Minotaur may be attributed to their not
  knowing their position; the pilot's desire to put the ship on the
  starboard tack at twelve o'clock at night, with the wind from the
  south-east, showed that he thought himself on the English coast.
  This fatal error in the navigation of the ship is not easily
  accounted for; it arises in a great measure from the dread of
  approaching the dangerous shoals on our own coast, many of them
  far off the land, such as the Leman, and Ower, Smith's Knowl, the
  Ridge, and others further in shore. Great fear of these shoals is
  felt by all hands, and no doubt the man at the helm would be
  cautioned not to bring the ship to the westward of her course,
  and he would therefore be apt to err on the other
  side&mdash;currents also may <a name="Page_160" id=
  "Page_160"></a>have carried her to the eastward. I am tempted to
  offer this opinion from having experienced a similar danger. In
  the year of the Battle of Copenhagen, I was in the Lynx sloop of
  war on her return from the Baltic, and when we supposed ourselves
  in mid-channel, between Yarmouth and the Texel, about two
  o'clock, in the middle watch, we touched the ground in broken
  water; happily the weather was moderate, and, by hauling to the
  westward we soon got into deep water again. The following
  morning, about ten o'clock, we spoke a lugger, and were informed
  that we were seven or eight leagues from the coast of Holland.
  The distance ran from the time we struck, told us that we must
  have been on the Haacks. A happy escape!</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_PALLAS_AND_THE_NYMPH" id=
  "THE_PALLAS_AND_THE_NYMPH"></a>THE PALLAS AND THE NYMPH.</h2>

  <p>In the month of December, 1810, the Pallas, a 32-gun frigate,
  commanded by Captain Paris Monke, was returning, in company with
  the Nymph, Captain Edward Sneyd Clay, from a month's cruise on
  the coast of Norway, and was steering for Leith, with a prize in
  tow. She had not got far to the southward, when, on Tuesday
  morning, the 18th, between nine and ten o'clock, land was
  discovered, but the weather was so thick, it could not be clearly
  defined. The pilot, however, gave it as his opinion that they
  were north of the Red-head. Towards the middle of the day they
  fell in with some fishing-boats, and Captain Monke having
  requested one of the fishermen to come on board the frigate, he
  learnt from this man that the ship was at that time off Stonehive
  and the Tod Head. At four o'clock, P.M., the usual <a name=
  "Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>order to pipe to supper was given;
  the wind was blowing from the north-west, and the vessel going at
  the rate of four knots an hour. Supper being over, the drum beat
  to quarters, and the captain, having received the usual reports,
  ordered the watch to be called. At six o'clock, in compliance
  with the wish of the pilot, the course was altered from
  south-west to south-south-west. For the last quarter of an hour
  the ship had been increasing her rate of sailing from five and a
  half to six knots an hour; the top-gallant scudding sails were
  therefore taken in, and the royal and top-gallant stay sails
  hauled down, as also the jib and the spanker. Soon after this the
  pilot, pointing towards the coast, said to the captain, 'There's
  Lunan Bay;' and shortly afterwards he said, 'There's the Red
  Head;' but it was too dark, then, to see the land, much less
  could the outline of the coast be distinguished. The captain
  inquired if they should not soon see the Bell Rock Light, and he
  was answered in the affirmative. He then ordered the officer of
  the watch to hail the forecastle, and direct the men to keep a
  vigilant look-out for the Bell Rock Light.</p>

  <p>Ere many minutes had elapsed after the order was given, a
  light was perceived before the starboard beam, which the pilot
  declared to be a signal hoisted on the pier at Arbroath to show
  that there was water enough for vessels to enter the harbour. The
  captain then went below to consult the book of sailing
  directions, and when he returned upon deck, he said to the pilot,
  'If that light be on Arbroath pier, as you suppose, we ought most
  certainly to be in sight of the light on the Bell Rock.' The
  pilot replied, 'We shall soon see it;' and Captain Monke repeated
  to the officer of the watch his order to keep a sharp look
  out.</p>

  <p>As the light on the Bell Rock did not appear, the captain
  became exceedingly anxious; the more so, as he <a name="Page_162"
  id="Page_162"></a>was convinced, by reckoning the distances from
  the Tod Head to the Red Head, and from the Red Head to the Bell
  Rock, and comparing their sum with the run from four o'clock,
  that the ship had run as many miles to the southward as would
  bring her up to the Bell Rock. To ascertain exactly the position
  of the ship, he desired the master to work off the run by the log
  up to eight o'clock, P.M., and in a short time the master
  reported that by his calculation the light which they saw was no
  other than the floating light of the Bell Rock, and that they had
  now only to bear up and shape a course for the Isle of May.</p>

  <p>The captain had been upon deck for more than five hours, and
  was so much fatigued that he went down to the gun-room to get
  some refreshment, at a little after ten o'clock, leaving positive
  orders with the officer of the watch and the master to be most
  attentive to the ship's course; and he was so anxious for her
  safety, that he had scarcely sat down in the gun-room before he
  sent for the pilot-book of sailing directions, that he might
  ascertain more exactly the position of the Bell Rock, and the
  course and distance from thence to the Isle of May. In a few
  minutes, the officer of the watch went down to report that the
  May light was in sight, and Captain Monke was in the act of going
  upon deck, when the vessel struck the ground. He instantly rushed
  upon deck, and inquired of the master where he supposed the ship
  had grounded. The reply was a startling one:&mdash;'I am afraid,'
  said he, 'that we are on the Bell Rock, and not a soul will be
  saved, unless we can forge her over it.' How they could possibly
  be upon the Bell Rock, when the master had himself so confidently
  declared they were running from it for some hours, appeared a
  mystery: but this was no time for arguing the matter. Captain
  Monke saw the danger both to the ship and all on board: <a name=
  "Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>he ordered the drum to beat to
  quarters, and the men were soon on deck and each at his post
  Having assured himself that the rudder was not damaged, the
  captain ordered the foretack to be hauled on board, and the yards
  to be braced with the larboard brace, which was done without loss
  of time. The lead was cast, to ascertain the depth of water,
  which the quarter-master reported to be twelve feet. The ship,
  which at first had taken the ground easily, now began to strike
  with great violence; and when they found that she did not forge
  ahead, the yards were braced aback, but to no better purpose, for
  she remained hard and fast as before.</p>

  <p>Land was now seen to leeward, and the master changed his
  opinion, and imagined that the frigate had struck on the Isle of
  May; but the pilot thought they were on shore in St. Andrew's
  Bay, and blamed the master for having hauled too soon. As the
  tide was falling, there was little hope of getting the ship
  afloat, although this was so far fortunate, that it afforded a
  better chance of escape for the crew.</p>

  <p>Orders were given to man the pumps, and the people obeyed with
  alacrity, and worked by turns throughout the night with the
  utmost vigour. The ship seemed to come up easier for a time, and
  the carpenter reported twelve feet water in the hold. When the
  moon rose, the position of the frigate with regard to the land
  was discovered; and as the tide ebbed, her larboard bow appeared
  to be but a short distance from the nearest rocks. From the time
  of the ship's striking, guns had been fired as signals of
  distress, to arouse the attention of the inhabitants of the
  coast, and these signals were soon answered by lights displayed
  along the shore, and large fires kindled on the beach. The glare
  of the torches moving to and fro on the shore denoted the
  inclination of the people to render assistance to the <a name=
  "Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>unfortunate vessel. Voices were
  heard hailing the ship, but it was impossible to distinguish the
  words. The boatswain and carpenter, and some others, declared
  that the men said, 'You are in St. Andrew's Bay&mdash;come on
  shore,' Upon this, the boatswain and gunner volunteered to land
  with two men in a small prize skiff, for the purpose of
  reconnoitring the beach. This proposition was immediately
  rejected by the captain, who assembled the principal officers on
  the forecastle and declared to them his determination not to
  suffer a single boat to be lowered during the night&mdash;but
  that they should all stick to the ship until daylight, as the
  only chance of preserving their lives.</p>

  <p>Happily the captain's orders were obeyed, though doubtless
  many would feel tempted to risk a landing. The Pallas became more
  and more uneasy&mdash;her rudder was carried away, and the sea
  broke completely over her. The men were each served with a dram,
  and were still kept at the pumps until three o'clock A.M., when
  the main beam broke and the others began to give way in
  succession. In order to lighten the vessel, the mainmast was cut
  away. At first, this did not appear to have the desired
  effect&mdash;but in all probability it would have fallen of
  itself and have done injury to the people; it now hung over the
  side, and promised to serve as a raft in case of necessity. The
  foremast was then cut away, and the mizenmast was doomed to
  follow&mdash;but the axe and tomahawk, which had been carried
  forward, were lost, or washed away. The ship by this time had
  fallen upon her beam ends, and the sea was making breaches over
  her, so that every individual had enough to do to keep himself
  from being washed overboard.</p>

  <p>About four o'clock in the morning, the spirits of the crew
  were revived by seeing a boat appear between the wreck and a
  large fire that had been kept burning imme<a name="Page_165" id=
  "Page_165"></a>diately opposite. This was a welcome sight, and it
  was hailed by three loud and hearty cheers from the Pallas.</p>

  <p>Many of the men by this time were suffering much from cold,
  hunger, and fatigue, and those who were able, got into the
  weather chains for safety and shelter. Daylight discovered to
  them the real position of the ship; the light which had been
  supposed to be on the Isle of May was that of a lime-kiln on the
  main land, and as the Bass and North Berwick Law were plainly
  visible, it was evident from their bearings that the frigate was
  on shore near to Dunbar. She was now a total wreck&mdash;the
  bottom had separated to some extent amidships from her upper
  works; a considerable portion of her floor timber was lying about
  ten yards to windward of the rest of the hull, and the iron
  ballast within this frame of timber was thus open to view. It was
  now time for every man to provide as far as possible for his own
  safety. A Portuguese sailor, an excellent swimmer, was the first
  to quit the wreck and swim on shore; several men attempted to
  follow his example, but five of them perished. The life-boat from
  Dunbar, which had been launched with great difficulty on account
  of the heavy surf beating on the rocks, reached the ship at ten
  o'clock in the morning of the 19th, and she took off a boat-load
  from the wreck and landed them in safety.</p>

  <p>This success encouraged the people to try to employ the boats
  of the Pallas, but they were all found to be stove, or otherwise
  rendered useless, with the exception of a sixteen-oared cutter.
  The cutter was launched without material injury, and fortunately
  reached the land with as many as she could carry. The life-boat
  again neared the ship, and made a second successful landing with
  a number of officers and men; and a third time she touched the
  wreck, and was again crowded with people, but unfortunately the
  rope which she carried as a <a name="Page_166" id=
  "Page_166"></a>hauling line was too short to reach between the
  ship and the shore, and this time she had scarcely put off from
  the quarter before she filled and upset. By this accident, six of
  the crew of the Pallas were drowned, and one of the bravest
  fellows belonging to the life-boat The other thirteen men who
  manned the boat, and several people from the wreck, were saved
  with great difficulty; a small fishing-boat, which had been
  opportunely launched through the surf, picked them up. Amongst
  others so rescued from a watery grave were Captain Monke, and Mr.
  Walker, the first lieutenant. The crew of the fishing-boat
  persevered with great courage and good judgment in their efforts
  to save the rest of the crew. They procured a small tow-line,
  which being held by one end on the beach, they made fast to the
  mizen chains of the ship. The boat was then hauled to and fro
  until, in eight or ten trips, she had cleared the wreck of all
  the people; and, with the exception of Mr. Tomlinson, the
  boatswain, and ten or twelve others who perished, the whole of
  the ship's company were saved.</p>

  <p>The kindness and hospitality exercised by the inhabitants of
  Dunbar and the surrounding country were beyond all praise. The
  sufferers, many of whom were insensible when carried on shore,
  and unconscious of the manner in which their lives had been
  preserved, were lodged, fed, and clothed. Captain Monke, who was
  much bruised, was carried by Captain Maitland to the house of his
  father, Lord Lauderdale, at Dunbar. The first lieutenant, Mr.
  Walker, who was picked up apparently lifeless, was conveyed to
  Broxmouth, the seat of the Duchess of Roxburgh, where he was,
  under Providence, indebted for his restoration to the unremitting
  attentions of the duchess and her husband, Mr. Manners.</p>

  <p>The humblest of the crew were equally well cared for. <a name=
  "Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>The duchess went from room to room,
  ministering to the wants of the sufferers, and seeing that every
  comfort was provided for them.</p>

  <p>It is gratifying to record that a handsome pecuniary reward
  was given by government to the fishermen and other inhabitants of
  Dunbar who so nobly risked their lives for the sake of their
  fellow-countrymen; and the widow of the man who was lost in the
  life-boat had a pension of &pound;25 per annum settled upon
  her.</p>

  <p>'I am persuaded,' writes Captain Monke, in his narrative,
  'that this court will participate in my feelings, and would think
  me most forgetful, if I did not here publicly express my grateful
  sense I shall ever retain of the humane and liberal conduct of
  the Duchess of Roxburgh and Mr. Manners, who in their hospitable
  mansion at Broxmouth administered every sort of comfort and
  medical relief to the far greater part of the suffering officers
  and people of the Pallas, many of whose lives were thereby
  preserved to their country. In justice to my own feelings, I
  cannot close my narrative without declaring to this honourable
  court that no men under similar circumstances could behave better
  than did the crew of the Pallas. So far from being dismayed by
  their perilous situation, they manifested equal firmness and
  subordination; and, in fact, from the first moment of the ship
  striking the ground, to the time when necessity compelled every
  individual to consult his own safety, they obeyed all the orders
  with as much alacrity as cheerfulness, and (what is more) without
  either noise or confusion. Hence, sir, I consider myself
  justified in asserting that, notwithstanding the number
  victualled on board at the time was reduced to one hundred and
  sixty, if any human exertion could, in the first instance, have
  got the Pallas afloat, she would not have been irrecoverably lost
  to the service. I must also beg leave to <a name="Page_168" id=
  "Page_168"></a>add, that the officers set every example; and that
  from Mr. Walker, the first-lieutenant, I derived, throughout this
  trying scene, the most effectual support and assistance.'</p>

  <p>The Nymph, which we have mentioned as being in company with
  the Pallas, got on shore the same night, on a rock called the
  Devil's Ark, near Skethard, misled by some irregularity in the
  lights on the Bell Rock and Isle of May.</p>

  <p>The crew of the Nymph were all saved, but the fine frigate was
  lost.</p>

  <p>Among the many services in which the fleets of Great Britain
  were engaged during the last war, none was more rife with perils
  and hardships than that on which the Baltic Fleet was employed.
  During the long winter nights the crews were continually exposed
  to intense cold, and the ships were often enveloped in such
  impenetrable fogs, that sometimes even the pilots were deceived
  as to their true position, and those lamentable consequences
  ensued of which the loss of the Minotaur was an example, (see
  page 154), her officers conceiving they were on the coast of
  England, when they were actually stranded on the opposite
  shore.</p>

  <p>We will briefly mention two instances, which may give the
  reader some idea of the severity of the climate in the Northern
  Seas.</p>

  <p>On the 23rd of December, 1808, the Fama (which had sailed from
  Carlscrona the previous day, in consort with some other
  men-of-war, and a convoy of merchantmen,) struck upon the Island
  of Bornholm, in the midst <a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>of
  such dense darkness, and so blinding a fall of snow, that it was
  impossible to discern any of the surrounding objects. The moment
  the ship struck, Lieutenant Topping, her commander, sprung from
  his berth and rushed upon deck, without giving himself time to
  put on his clothes. In his anxiety for the safety of his ship,
  and of those who were on board, he continued to give his orders,
  without any other protection from the piercing blast and driving
  snow than a blanket, which one of his men had thrown over his
  shoulders; '<i>in fifteen minutes from the time the vessel first
  struck, he fell upon the deck a corpse</i>.' One man and a woman
  shared the same fate, the rest of the crew survived the night,
  and were next morning saved by the Danes.</p>

  <p>The circumstances attending the loss of the Pandora were still
  more horrible. She struck on the Scaw Reef, a shoal on the coast
  of Jutland, on the night of the 13th of February, 1811, and in
  three hours her rudder was carried away, and the hold nearly
  filled with water. The wind was bitterly cold, and, as the men
  were unable to get below, they were in danger of being either
  washed overboard, or frozen to death, before morning. In this
  dreadful state they remained until daybreak, when it was
  discovered that several of them had perished from the inclemency
  of the weather. The survivors contrived to cut a hole in the side
  of the deck which was above water, through which they crept
  below, one by one, to seek protection from the cold. During the
  day, some boats attempted to put out to their assistance, but the
  sea ran so high that it was impossible to approach the wreck. The
  unhappy crew, disappointed in their hopes of relief, endeavoured
  to launch the boats; but these were so encased in ice, that they
  resembled large blocks of marble, and it was impossible to move
  them. In the course of the night the wind and sea abated, and the
  <a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>Danes succeeded in rescuing
  the people of the Pandora from their perilous situation, but not
  before twenty-nine had perished from the intense cold.</p>

  <p>The month of November, 1811, was most disastrous to the Baltic
  Fleet. The British ships of war had already suffered so severely
  from attempting the dangerous navigation of the Northern Seas too
  late in the year, that the commander-in-chief on the station
  received orders on no account to delay the departure of the last
  homeward-bound convoy beyond the 1st of November. In obedience to
  these instructions, Rear-Admiral Reynolds sailed with a convoy
  from Hano on that day, having hoisted his broad pendant on board
  the St. George, of 98 guns, Captain Daniel Oliver Guion; but
  owing to severe gales he was compelled to put back on three
  several occasions, and the weather did not permit him finally to
  leave the anchorage until the 12th of the month. On the 15th the
  St George and convoy arrived off the Island of Zealand, where
  they anchored to wait for a favourable wind, having met with very
  rough weather in their passage from Hano, and several of the
  convoy having foundered, without its being possible for the
  others to render them the least assistance. In the course of the
  night of the 15th the wind increased to a hurricane, and all
  hands on board the St. George were summoned to give the ship
  cable. Before this could be accomplished the sea poured through
  the hawse-holes, carried everything away, and rendered it
  impossible for many of the men to stand to their duty. They were
  still in the act of veering away the cable, when a large merchant
  vessel, which had been seen looming through the darkness, drifted
  down upon them, its hull coming violently in collision with the
  bows of the St. George, and severing her cables;&mdash;one
  piercing shriek followed,&mdash;the merchantman gave a lurch, and
  the next instant was engulfed in the raging billows.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>However appalling the
  sight of this fearful tragedy might have been to the crew of the
  St. George, their own danger was too imminent to allow them much
  time for reflection, for on heaving the lead they found only
  fourteen fathoms, though they had anchored in twenty. The best
  bower anchor was at once let go, as the ship appeared to be fast
  drifting towards the shore; but such was the force of the wind
  and sea, that its massive ring broke off as if it had been only a
  piece of wire. Upon this it was resolved to wear her off the
  land, and the jib and foretopmast stay-sail were loosed, but
  before they could be set the sails were wrenched from the
  bolt-ropes, and borne away by the blast. The lead being cast
  again, eight fathoms were reported; the sheet anchor was let go,
  in hopes that it would hold, but, like the other anchor, it made
  no impression on the ship, and broke short off. As a last
  resource, the men began to cut away the masts, when, just as they
  fell, a heavy sea lifted the vessel and hurled her with violence
  upon a sand bank, where she remained fast, the masts having by
  good fortune fallen clear of her sides.</p>

  <p>There was but little hope now of saving the ship, yet the crew
  behaved with the most admirable steadiness, and obeyed with
  cheerful alacrity when they were ordered to man the pumps.
  Towards daybreak the rudder was torn from its fastenings, and it
  was only the discovery that the water did not gain on the ship
  that sustained the drooping spirits of the seamen, exhausted as
  they were with their arduous exertions and long exposure to the
  biting cold and constant fall of sleet and snow. At half-past six
  the long-wished-for dawn appeared, when, to their dismay, they
  found themselves on a sand bank, four miles from the shore. As
  the wind and sea gradually abated, the rest of the squadron
  attempted to render them assistance, but did not venture <a name=
  "Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>to approach too close to the shoal.
  The St. George continued to strike heavily until twelve that
  night, when her head swung round to the land, and, contrary to
  all expectations, the water was found to have risen three feet
  since eight o'clock in the evening. By ten the next morning
  (Sunday, the 17th of November) she was clear of all danger, and
  having fitted up jury-masts, with a rudder supplied from the
  Cressy, she arrived in safety at Gottenburg, about the 2nd of
  December.</p>

  <p>Having partially repaired damages, Admiral Reynolds weighed
  anchor on the 17th December, and proceeded, in consort with the
  Defence and Cressy, to convoy a homeward-bound fleet of
  merchantmen.</p>

  <p>On the 23rd, another north-westerly gale was encountered, on
  the coast of Jutland. At midnight, signals were made to wear, but
  owing to the disabled state of the St. George, this was found
  impossible. In the hope of bringing her head round to the wind,
  an anchor was let go, but the hawser, catching under her keel,
  tore away the temporary rudder, and snapped itself with the
  strain, and again the ship fell off. The captain gave orders to
  strike the lower yards and topmasts, and to lighten the vessel.
  Between five and six in the morning of the 24th, the report of a
  gun was heard from the Defence, which was supposed to have got on
  shore about two miles and a half off. A short time after, the St.
  George struck, and drifted towards the shore, and from this
  moment all hope of saving the ship vanished.</p>

  <p>Upon examining the well, the carpenter reported ten feet water
  in the hold; and this rose so rapidly, that in the space of half
  an hour it reached the lower deck, driving the people to the main
  deck. Admiral Reynolds and the captain used every effort to
  encourage the men to remain steady to their duty, as the only
  chance of preserving their lives. At ten o'clock, the sea swept
  the <a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>main deck, so that all
  hands were obliged to seek refuge on the poop. All the boats,
  except the yawl, had either been stove or washed overboard. As an
  instance of the obedience and discipline of the crew of the St.
  George, three or four men came forward, and asked permission to
  attempt to reach the shore in the yawl: this request was at first
  granted, but as they were about to lower her into the sea, it was
  considered impossible that the boat could live, and the men were
  directed to return to their posts. Without a murmur, they
  instantly obeyed; and as if Providence had rewarded this implicit
  obedience and reliance upon their officers, two of these men were
  of the few that were saved.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to describe the suffering of the helpless
  crew. Their numbers, originally about seven hundred and fifty,
  had been terribly thinned by the severity of the weather, and the
  surging of the waves, which every instant burst over them. At
  eight o'clock in the evening of the 24th, fourteen men took the
  boat and attempted to pull from the wreck, but they had not gone
  many yards when she upset, and her crew perished. The mizenmast
  still stood, and orders were given for its being cut away, but as
  no axes could be found, the men were obliged to use their knives
  to cut the lanyards of the rigging; at this moment, a sea struck
  the mast, carrying away the poop, and the men who were upon it.
  As the poop was swept away from the wreck, it bore not only the
  living but the dead. The latter far outnumbered the former, and
  it became necessary for the general preservation to cast
  overboard the bodies of their dead comrades. But their strength,
  already weakened by previous suffering, was unequal to the
  performance of this painful duty; and while thus employed, a sea
  swept over the poop, scattering the men upon the foaming billows.
  Five regained it, but were again washed off, and again succeeded
  in <a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>reaching their former
  position. Of these, two died, and the other three were washed on
  shore.</p>

  <p>The scene on board was one of the most harrowing description.
  Mingled together were the living, the dying, and the dead. The
  bodies were piled up by the survivors in rows one above another,
  as a shelter from the violence of the waves, which broke
  incessantly over them.</p>

  <p>In the fourth row lay the admiral and his friend Captain
  Guion; whilst the groans of the dying, mingling with the roar of
  the tempest, unnerved the hearts of those who had hitherto shown
  an unappalled front to the perils surrounding them.</p>

  <p>There still remained about two hundred men, who were employed
  in constructing a raft, as the last chance of saving their lives.
  After considerable labour, this was effected, by lashing together
  a topsail yard and a cross-jack yard, the only spars that
  remained.</p>

  <p>Upon this, ten men left the wreck, but the timbers being
  improperly secured, they broke adrift, and the first sea that
  came washed five men off; the others gained the shore, one of
  whom died.</p>

  <p>According to all accounts, even the few who survived would
  have perished, had it not been for the humane conduct of the
  Danes who came to their assistance; these, at the risk of their
  own lives, succeeded in rescuing from the raft the seven
  exhausted sufferers who survived, out of the crew of seven
  hundred and fifty men.</p>

  <p>The St. George, as has been already mentioned, was in company
  with both the Cressy and Defence. Captain Pater, who commanded
  the former, seeing the impossibility of rendering any assistance
  to the St. George, and the imminent risk to his own ship if he
  remained longer on the starboard tack, wore, and escaped the
  danger.</p>

  <p>The master of the Defence reported to Captain Atkins that the
  St. George had gone on shore, and that the <a name="Page_175" id=
  "Page_175"></a>Cressy had veered and was standing to the
  southward,&mdash;at the same time pointing out the great danger
  the ship was in, and recommending that he should follow the
  example of the Cressy. The captain inquired whether the admiral
  had made the signal to part company; upon being answered in the
  negative, he replied, 'I will never desert my admiral in the hour
  of danger and distress.'</p>

  <p>At about six o'clock A.M., the hands were turned up to wear
  ship, but before this could be accomplished she struck, the sea
  made a breach over her, and washed several men overboard.</p>

  <p>The captain gave orders to fire minute guns, and cut away the
  masts. Five or six guns only had been fired, before they broke
  adrift, so that it was impossible to fire any more; but
  providentially these had been heard by the look-out men on shore,
  to whose assistance may be attributed the preservation of the few
  lives that were saved.</p>

  <p>The waves swept over the vessel, forcing numbers of the crew
  down the hatchways, the guns and other heavy articles had broken
  loose, killing some, breaking the arms and legs of others, whose
  agonizing cries served only to add to the horrors of a scene
  scarcely within the power of description.</p>

  <p>The captain at this time stood on the poop, holding on only by
  a howitzer that was lashed before the mizenmast, the officers and
  crew clinging to other parts of the wreck. The boats were all
  stove, except the pinnace, in which about twenty men had
  collected, when a sea, breaking over the wreck, washed her
  overboard, capsized her, and all perished.</p>

  <p>Another sea struck the Defence with such excessive violence as
  to lift a spare anchor from its berth, throw it up on end,
  killing in its fall upon the forecastle about thirty men. The
  booms were washed away, and with <a name="Page_176" id=
  "Page_176"></a>them nearly one hundred men, who were clinging to
  the different spars.</p>

  <p>The following account of the escape of one of her crew is so
  interesting, that it has been thought better to leave it as
  nearly as possible in his own words, than to alter it for the
  sake of brevity:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'I got on one side of the booms that were floating among the
  rest of the wreck. At that time every man, except two, John Platt
  and Ralph Teasel, two of the men who were saved, were washed off.
  Myself and several more were at the same time swept off the
  mizen-top. I then made the best of my way from one spar to
  another, until I got on one side of the booms. At this time about
  forty men regained their position upon the booms, when another
  sea washed all off except four. I got on the booms a second time,
  and spoke to John Brown, and told him I thought we were
  approaching the shore. There were then about twenty men on them,
  but when we reached the shore there were only six left.</p>

  <p>'Two Danes on the beach came to our assistance; my foot got
  jammed in amongst the small spars, and my comrades, seeing that I
  was unable to get off the raft, were coming to my help, when the
  Danes made signs to them to be quiet. One Dane made three
  attempts before he succeeded in reaching the raft, and the third
  time he was nearly exhausted; he managed to get hold of my foot,
  and wrenched it out, and carried me on shore. I was then taken up
  to a shed to wait for some carts which were coming for us, most
  of us being unable to walk. In about ten minutes a number of
  gentlemen arrived on horseback, and some carts came down upon the
  beach. We were then placed in them, and driven to a small village
  called Shelton. On the road the man who drove the cart spoke to a
  woman, and asked her if she had any liquor. She replied by
  drawing a bottle <a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>from her
  pocket, and made each of us take a dram, which I believe was in a
  great measure the saving of our lives.</p>

  <p>'We soon arrived at the houses in the village, where we were
  stripped and put to bed, and treated by the inhabitants with the
  greatest hospitality and kindness. When I awoke, I found another
  seaman had been placed in the same bed with me; he had come on
  shore some time after myself upon a piece of wreck. He said, just
  as he reached the shore the poop and forecastle were capsized,
  and not a man to be seen, except a few upon pieces of wreck. In
  the evening, a gentleman who spoke English came to our bedside,
  and told us that an officer had been brought up to the house. He
  also told us that there was another ship on shore to the
  southward of us, which appeared to be a three-decker, lying with
  her stern on shore. We knew directly it could be no other than
  the St. George.</p>

  <p>'He inquired if we were able to get up, and go and look at the
  body of the officer, and see if we knew him. We answered yes,
  and, with the assistance of the people, went into the barn, and
  recognised our captain. We then returned to bed again, being too
  exhausted to stand. The gentleman told us that medical assistance
  could not be procured that night, but that we should have every
  nourishment the house could afford. He then took his leave,
  promising that he would return in the morning, when we might be
  better able to speak to him.</p>

  <p>'He accordingly came in the morning, and inquired what force
  our ship was.</p>

  <p>'We told him a 74-gun ship, with a company of 600 men. Upon
  our inquiring if any more of our shipmates had reached the shore,
  he answered no; and we returned most hearty thanks to the
  Almighty for our deliverance!</p>

  <p>'On Sunday, the 29th, we put our captain into a coffin, and
  buried him in Shelton Church-yard, with two seamen alongside of
  him.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>'It was some time,
  through the bitterness of the cold and the bruises we had
  received, before we were able to walk about. As soon as we had
  gained sufficient strength, we went down to the beach, where we
  saw, scattered for about two miles along the beach, the wreck of
  the Defence, but not a corpse was to be seen. We supposed they
  had drifted away to the southward and westward, a strong current
  setting that way. This opinion was in a great measure confirmed
  by seeing our officers' things sold, and other articles belonging
  to the ship, six miles to the southward of where we were cast
  away, when we went to join the few who were saved from the St.
  George. On the 13th January, our captain was taken up again, and
  carried to Rinkum Church, and placed in a vault with the honours
  of war.'</p>

  <p>Such was the unhappy fate of the St. George and Defence; only
  six men from the latter ship being saved, out of a crew of 600.
  Two days afterwards, when the gale had abated, a Danish boat,
  with two of the English sailors, went on board the St. George to
  bring away the corpses of the admiral and others, but they found
  the decks had been entirely swept away. Nothing could exceed the
  hospitality and kindness with which the Danes treated the few who
  were thrown upon their shore. Nor was the Danish government
  backward in generosity. The dead were buried with military
  honours, and the survivors were sent to England without exchange.
  The following letter from Major General Tellequist, given in his
  own language, sufficiently shows the deep commiseration felt by
  the Danish government, as well as by himself, for the lamentable
  catastrophe which befel the St. George and Defence.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>'Randus, the 21st of January, 1812.</p>

    <p>'Sir,&mdash;Though the grievous misfortune which has
    happened his great Britannic Majesty's ships of war <a name=
    "Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>
    on the Danish coast perhaps already may be known to your
    Excellency; nevertheless, whereas the opposite case may be
    possible, I will not omit hereby to make you acquainted with
    the sorrowful accident, assuring you that I am very
    compassionating.</p>

    <p>'The 24th of last month, in the night, the English ships of
    the line, St. George and Defence, are splitted upon the western
    coast of Jutland, and the violent waves made it impossible to
    bring the wretched crews any assistance. From both ships are
    saved but thirteen persons, who are cast on shore by the sea
    with goods of wreck. Some of them are sick, and at present
    under care. A part of the dead bodies are driven to land, and
    interred with as much ceremony as the circumstances would
    admit.</p>

    <p>'All possible pains have been taken to find out the bodies
    of the officers, in order to show them military honours, by the
    obsequies upon the churchyard.</p>

    <p>'Two bodies of officers were found, and buried with military
    honours. Among these was the body of Captain Atkins, commanding
    the Defence, which is deposited in a church till I receive the
    further ordaining from my most gracious sovereign.</p>

    <p>'I complain much that the body of Admiral Reynolds has not
    yet been found, for all the pains which are taken on this
    purpose.</p>

    <p>'Agreeably to the charitable sensibility of the Danish
    nation, the inhabitants have been very grieved to see the
    English warriors in such a distress without being able to
    assist them; and I am very sorry, Sir, that I cannot give your
    Excellency of this accident an account less sorrowful.</p>

    <p>'With great esteem, I remain, Sir,</p>

    <p>'To Governor Maurice.'</p>
  </div>

  <p><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>The body of Rear Admiral
  Reynolds was found a few days after the date of the above letter,
  and deposited with military honours near that of Captain Atkins,
  in Rinkum Church.</p>

  <p>The surviving officers and men of the St. George were tried by
  a court-martial at Sheerness, and were acquitted of all blame
  with reference to the loss of that vessel.</p>

  <p>With respect to the loss of the Defence, the court was of
  opinion that she was lost by getting on shore on the western
  coast of Jutland, in company with his Majesty's late ship St.
  George, in consequence of the noble and heroic determination of
  the captain to stay to the last by his admiral, at a moment of
  extreme danger and distress, conduct which, in the opinion of the
  court, will reflect immortal honour on the memory of Captain
  Atkins.</p>

  <p>Rear Admiral Reynolds was an officer of considerable
  experience, and had distinguished himself on several occasions
  previous to his melancholy fate on board the St. George.</p>

  <p>In the year 1797, he commanded the Amazon, a 36-gun frigate,
  and was cruizing the 13th of January off Ushant, in company with
  the Indefatigable, Captain Sir Edward Pellew, when a large ship
  was descried, steering under easy sail for France. This was a
  little after twelve o'clock at noon; chase was immediately given,
  and at four in the afternoon, the stranger was discovered to be a
  French two-decker, the Droits de l'Homme, of 74 guns.</p>

  <p>She had on board, exclusive of her crew of 700 men, about 1050
  troops, which, with 50 English prisoners, made 1800 souls.</p>

  <p>At a little past five o'clock, the Indefatigable closed with
  the enemy and began the action; this had lasted about an hour,
  when the Indefatigable unavoidably shot ahead, on which the
  Amazon took her place and nobly <a name="Page_181" id=
  "Page_181"></a>continued the battle. The Indefatigable, having in
  the meantime repaired her rigging, again joined in the attack,
  the British ships placing themselves one on each quarter of their
  opponent. A continued fire was kept up for upwards of five hours,
  when they found it absolutely necessary to sheer off, in order to
  secure their masts. During the action the sea is described as
  having run so high, that the men on the main decks of the
  frigates were up to their middles in water. As soon as the masts
  were secured, the attack was again resumed, and notwithstanding
  the crews of both ships were almost exhausted with their
  exertions, it was prolonged for five hours more, when, late in
  the night, the fire ceased on both sides. The Amazon had now
  nearly three feet of water in the hold, and was in other respects
  most severely damaged. The enemy had suffered still more; her
  foremast was shot away, and the main and mizen-masts left
  tottering, the decks being strewed with the dead and dying.</p>

  <p>At about four o'clock in the morning, an officer on board the
  Indefatigable reported breakers ahead, and the loss of all three
  vessels appeared almost inevitable.</p>

  <p>The Indefatigable was then close under the starboard quarter
  of the Droits de L'Homme, and the Amazon as near to her on the
  larboard bow. The Indefatigable was fortunate enough to avoid the
  danger by being able to make sail to the southward, and she
  escaped.</p>

  <p>When daylight broke, a terrible spectacle was presented. The
  Droits de L'Homme had drifted towards the land&mdash;broadside
  on&mdash;a tremendous surf beating over her. The position of the
  Amazon was as precarious, notwithstanding every effort was made
  by her officers and crew to work her off shore, all proved
  unavailing, and she struck the ground. The ship's company, with
  the exception of six men, gained the shore, which proved to be
  Audierne Bay, where they were all made prisoners.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>The melancholy fate of
  the Droits de L'Homme is described in James's <i>Naval
  History</i>. Already 900 souls had perished, when the fourth
  night came with renewed horrors,&mdash;'weak, distracted, and
  wanting everything,' says one of the prisoners, a British
  officer, in his narrative, 'we envied the fate of those whose
  lifeless corpses no longer needed sustenance. The sense of hunger
  was already lost, but a parching thirst consumed our vitals.'....
  'Almost lost to a sense of humanity, we no longer looked with
  pity on those who were the speedy forerunners of our own fate,
  and a consultation took place, to sacrifice some one to be food
  to the remainder. The die was going to be cast, when the welcome
  sight of a man-of-war brig renewed our hopes. A cutter speedily
  followed, and both anchored at a short distance from the wreck.
  They then sent their boats to us, and by means of large rafts,
  about 150, out of nearly 400 who attempted it, were saved by the
  brig that evening; 380 were left to 'endure another night's
  misery,&mdash;when, dreadful to relate, about one half were found
  dead next morning!'</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="HERO" id="HERO"></a>HERO.</h2>

  <p>We have next to relate the still more tragical fate of the
  Hero, of 74 guns. This vessel was lost on the Northern Haaks,
  under nearly the same circumstances as the Minotaur in the
  preceding year, but with more fatal results, as every soul on
  board perished.</p>

  <p>The following particulars are derived from the accounts taken
  from the evidence of Captain Fanshawe, of the Grasshopper, and
  from the journals of the day.</p>

  <p>The Grasshopper sailed from Wingo Sound on the <a name=
  "Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>18th of December, 1811, in company
  with the Hero, Egeria, and Prince William, and a convoy of about
  120 merchantmen. The weather, at the time they commenced their
  voyage, was stormy and tempestuous. The Egeria and Prince William
  parted company on the 20th, and on the 23rd the Grasshopper was
  left in company with the Hero, and about eighteen
  merchantmen.</p>

  <p>At about half-past eleven o'clock, Captain Newman, of the
  Hero, made signal to the Grasshopper to come within hail;
  conceiving that they were on the Silver Pitts, he directed the
  course to be altered to the south-west, which was accordingly
  done. They continued their course until ten o'clock at night,
  when the signal was made to alter it two points to port.</p>

  <p>The Grasshopper was at this time going at the rate of nine
  knots an hour; four of the convoy had been kept in view up to
  this period, but were soon lost sight of in the heavy squall of
  snow and sleet. At half-past three o'clock all hands were turned
  up, when the ship being in broken water, she struck with great
  violence, and suddenly fell into three fathoms water. The best
  bower was let go, and she was brought to an anchor. In a few
  minutes the ship struck again, and continued to do so as long as
  she remained in that position.</p>

  <p>The crew of the Grasshopper had now their attention called to
  the situation of the Hero. It was first supposed that she was at
  anchor, although she fired several guns, and burnt blue lights,
  which in about half-an-hour ceased. At daylight it was discovered
  that both the ships were inside the Northern Haaks, about five or
  six miles from the Texel Island. About a mile from the
  Grasshopper was the Hero&mdash;a complete wreck&mdash;lying on
  her starboard broadside. The ship's company were all crowded
  together upon the poop and forecastle; the sea making clean
  breaches over her. An attempt was made by the crew <a name=
  "Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>of the Grasshopper to reach the
  Hero, but the surf ran so high that it prevented all
  communication, and they were under the imperious necessity of
  seeing their comrades perish, without the slightest possibility
  of being able to render them assistance.</p>

  <p>The Hero had hoisted a flag of truce, and fired a gun: in a
  short time these signals of distress were answered, by several
  vessels putting out from the Texel to her relief; but owing to
  the flood-tide, and the strong gale of wind then blowing, the
  boats were unable to get nearer than three miles.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding that those on board the Grasshopper were
  themselves in a most precarious position, from the repeated
  shocks the ship had sustained by striking against the ground,
  their attention was completely diverted from themselves, in their
  anxiety for the fate of the Hero. The waves burst with relentless
  fury over the doomed vessel, every moment snatching a victim from
  the now almost deserted decks.</p>

  <p>As the night was approaching, and the weather still continued
  boisterous, Captain Fanshawe, having taken the opinion of the
  officers, judged that there was no other alternative for saving
  the lives of his crew than by surrendering to the enemy. At four
  o'clock the cable was cut, and they made sail for the Helder
  Point, where they surrendered to the Dutch Vice-Admiral, De
  Wintner.</p>

  <p>The Hero went to pieces during the night: in the morning not a
  vestige of her was to be seen. Every exertion was made by the
  Dutch squadron to save the crew, but the weather was so stormy,
  that all their efforts proved abortive, and thus every soul on
  board perished.</p>

  <p>In the year 1798, Captain Newman distinguished himself by a
  most gallant action which he fought off the coast of Ireland. He
  was then in command of the <a name="Page_185" id=
  "Page_185"></a>Mermaid, 32-gun frigate, and was cruising in
  consort with the Revolutionnaire, of 38 guns, Captain Twysden,
  and the Kangaroo, gun-brig, commanded by Captain Brace. On the
  15th October, when near Black Cod Bay, two very large French
  frigates were seen and pursued, but they were lost sight of
  during the night. The next morning, however, the Mermaid and
  Kangaroo made out one of the Frenchmen, and the Kangaroo came up
  with her the same afternoon, but was speedily disabled by the
  heavy fire of her opponent, and compelled to drop astern. The
  Mermaid kept on in chase, and engaged the French vessel, which
  proved to be the Loire, 46-gun frigate, on the morning of the
  17th October. Early in the action the French attempted to board,
  but were frustrated by the skilful handling of the Mermaid, which
  enabled her to close within pistol-shot of the Loire, when the
  latter's foretopmast was soon shot away, and the fire from her
  great guns nearly silenced, though a continuous storm of musketry
  was still kept up from her decks. Upon attempting to rake her
  opponent, the Mermaid's mizenmast unfortunately went by the
  board, so that she fell off, and the maintop-mast almost
  instantly followed. By this time the rigging of the English
  frigate was completely cut to pieces, and her boats destroyed;
  she was also making a great deal of water, having received
  several shots between wind and water. In this crippled condition,
  Captain Newman had no other alternative but to discontinue the
  action. This was done without any attempt on the part of the
  Loire to renew the engagement, the French being no doubt only too
  glad to get rid of her spirited antagonist, though she was only
  half the size of their own vessel.</p>

  <p>On the following day the Loire fell in with the Anson and
  Kangaroo, and surrendered to the British flag. Subsequently
  Captain Newman was appointed to the <a name="Page_186" id=
  "Page_186"></a>Loire, having the proud satisfaction of commanding
  the vessel in whose capture he had so gallantly assisted.</p>

  <p>In 1808, our officer received the command of the unfortunate
  Hero, which ship, in 1810, formed part of the squadron under Sir
  James Saumarez, employed for the protection of commerce in the
  North Sea. Here he continued in the unpleasant duty of convoying
  merchant vessels backwards and forwards from Dar's Head, the
  south entrance of the Great Belt, to Sproe Island. On the 25th of
  September, Captain Newman, in company with the Mars, 74, arrived
  off Yarmouth, having in charge between five and six hundred
  merchantmen, the largest convoy that had ever sailed from the
  Baltic. He again returned to his former station in March, 1811,
  where he remained until the latter end of the year, when his ship
  was selected, with others, to convoy the homeward-bound fleet. On
  this occasion, he appears to have had sad misgivings as to the
  prudence of sending ships home at so late a period of the year,
  through the dangerous navigation of the northern seas. On the day
  previous to the sailing of the squadron from Wingo Sound, he
  observed, 'I cannot help thinking that we have been detained too
  long, and it is well if some of us do not share the fate of the
  Minotaur.'<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id=
  "FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class=
  "fnanchor">[14]</a> His words were but too prophetic; and, ere
  long, he and two thousand of our brave defenders perished on a
  foreign strand.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_DAEDALUS" id="THE_DAEDALUS"></a><a name=
  "Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>THE D&AElig;DALUS.</h2>

  <p>His Majesty's ship D&aelig;dalus, of 38 guns, Captain Murray
  Maxwell, sailed from Spithead on the 27th of January, 1813, in
  charge of an East Indian convoy, and made the island of Ceylon,
  near the Pointe de Galle, on the 1st of July. She passed Dondra
  Head at sunset, and then steered east by north during the night,
  in order to pass well outside the Basses. In the morning, the
  ship's head was pointed to the north, to get near land, a good
  look-out being kept both from the deck and mast-head for rocks
  and breakers. The atmosphere was so clear that a ripple might
  have been seen upon the water for miles around. Nothing appeared
  to indicate danger; the vessel was supposed to be seven or eight
  miles off the land, and the master was pointing out to Captain
  Maxwell her position upon the chart, when they felt her take the
  ground abaft; but so very easily, that many people on board were
  not aware that she had touched. Signals were immediately made to
  warn the convoy of their danger, but before the signals could be
  answered, the D&aelig;dalus swung off into deep water. All sail
  was set, and strong hopes were entertained that she was not
  materially injured; but her frame was too slight to sustain any
  shock whatever without damage, the lower part of the stern-post
  had given way, occasioning a leak of such magnitude, that
  although the pumps were instantly manned; and worked with
  unceasing energy, the water could not be kept under. A signal was
  made for the convoy to bring to, and to send all their carpenters
  on board the D&aelig;dalus, which was immediately done, but the
  combined efforts of the whole were unavailing to reduce the leak.
  The rudder worked <a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>so much
  that it was found necessary to unship it from the broken part of
  the stern-post, and bring it alongside; and in order to relieve
  the ship from the pressure aft, the guns and other heavy things
  were carried forward; this, however, was of so little avail, that
  the guns and anchors were soon thrown overboard. They then
  prepared a sail with oakum and tar, and got it over the stern, in
  order, by passing it under the keel, to stop the leak. For a time
  this seemed to have the desired effect, and hopes were
  entertained that they might be able to carry the ship to
  Trincomalee; but these hopes were of short duration. In spite of
  the indefatigable exertions of every officer and man on board,
  the water gained upon them till it rose two feet above the
  orlop-deck. The men had now been working without intermission for
  eight hours, and their strength and spirits began to fail, when,
  notwithstanding all their efforts, they saw the water rising to
  the level of the lower deck.</p>

  <p>Captain Maxwell now knew that there was not a chance of saving
  his ship, and he felt the painful necessity of leaving her as
  soon as possible, in order to preserve the lives of his men,
  whilst there was yet time. He ordered the boys, idlers, and two
  divisions of seamen and marines to get into the boats which were
  alongside, while the remaining men were employed at the pumps to
  keep the ship afloat, The good order and discipline which
  prevailed during this scene are beyond all praise. 'The men
  behaved,' to use the words of the captain, 'as if they were
  moving from one ship to another in any of the king's ports.'</p>

  <p>Such conduct is highly creditable, not only to the ship's
  company, but likewise to the captain and officers, in whom the
  crew must have reposed most perfect confidence, or such real good
  order could not have been maintained at such a time.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>The ship was settling
  fast, when the boats returned to carry away the remainder of the
  officers and men, they left the pumps and embarked in the boats,
  taking with them the hammocks and clothes belonging to the ship's
  company. The last man who stood upon the deck of the sinking ship
  was her captain. When all others had gone, he too with a heavy
  heart stepped into the boat which bore him from her side; sadly
  and sorrowfully he fixed his gaze upon the wreck of 'his home on
  the waters.' In a few minutes the ship gave a lurch, and, falling
  on her beam ends, remained in that position for the space of a
  minute, then she righted, showing only her quarter-deck ports
  above water, and then gently and majestically sunk into the bosom
  of the deep blue sea.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="THE_PERSIAN" id="THE_PERSIAN"></a>THE PERSIAN.</h2>

  <p>The Persian, an 18-gun brig, commanded by Captain Charles
  Bertram, was lost on the Silver Keys, St. Domingo, in the West
  Indies, on the 26th of June, 1813. It appears from Captain
  Bertram's statement, that the Keys were laid down on the chart
  too far to the southward, or that the ship was carried in that
  direction by a strong current not mentioned in any of the charts.
  The Persian struck about five o'clock P.M., by running stem on,
  upon one of the rocks; she was at the time going at the rate of
  three or four knots an hour. Everything was done to back her off;
  the water was started, most of the guns thrown overboard, the
  boats were got out, and the anchors cut from the bows. These
  measures for the moment seemed to have the desired effect; but in
  paying off, she struck on another rock, and from this it was
  <a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>impossible to move her.
  Again the same means were resorted to; the remainder of the guns,
  spars, &amp;c, were thrown overboard, but to no purpose. The
  pumps had been kept in active play from the first moment of
  alarm, but the water gained on them so fast, there was little
  hope of the vessel keeping afloat till daylight. The Captain,
  therefore, resolved to prepare for the worst, and he directed a
  large raft to be made for the safety of some of the ship's
  company. About seven o'clock, two hours after she first struck,
  Captain Bertram perceived that she was gradually sinking; he
  therefore ordered as many of the ship's company as the boats
  would hold, to get into the two cutters and the jolly-boat; the
  cutters were placed under the command of Mr. Norris, the second
  lieutenant, and Mr. Nicholls, the master; and the jolly-boat
  under the superintendence of the gunner. These boats were ordered
  to remain near the ship, in case anything should occur to render
  it necessary for the people to return on board.</p>

  <p>About half-past nine P.M., Lieutenant Price and the rest of
  the ship's company, excepting two or three who remained on board
  with the captain, took their places upon the raft, which was
  veered by a hawser to leeward of the brig, and directed to remain
  in that position until the morning. At two o'clock in the morning
  Captain Bertram, convinced that there was no hope of saving his
  ship, got into his gig with the men who had stayed with him, and
  he had scarcely left the side of the Persian ere she slipped off
  the rock, fell over on the larboard side, and sunk into about
  seven fathoms water, the tops of the masts only being visible
  above the waves.</p>

  <p>At daylight, Captain Bertram, with the other boats, bore up
  for the raft, which had broken from the hawser during the night
  and drifted to some distance. They found her and her crew in a
  very deplorable state,&mdash;the <a name="Page_191" id=
  "Page_191"></a>lashings had been cut through by the rocks, and
  many of the timbers were broken, so that they scarcely held
  together, and the men had had great difficulty in keeping her
  from being dashed to pieces against the rocks, and in preserving
  themselves from being carried away by the surf which washed over
  them continually.</p>

  <p>Here was a great difficulty to be overcome; the raft was
  evidently so insecure that it could not be depended upon for an
  hour, and the only means of saving the men was by distributing
  them amongst the boats, which were already so over-crowded, that
  it would be imminently perilous to add to their freight. However,
  Captain Bertram did not hesitate to brave the danger, but set the
  example by first taking four men from the raft into his own gig,
  and directing the other boats to receive the rest amongst them in
  their relative proportions. His commands were instantly and
  cheerfully obeyed, but to carry them into effect the boats' crews
  were obliged to throw overboard the few articles of clothing they
  had saved, and the greater part of the provisions, in order to
  enable the boats to bear the additional weight.</p>

  <p>It was now between five and six o'clock in the morning; the
  wind was blowing fresh from the east; the nearest part of St.
  Domingo was, as far as they could judge, about twenty-five
  leagues distant, to reach which they supposed they must go
  through the Mona passage, the most dangerous in the West
  Indies.</p>

  <p>One of the cutters had forty-five men on board, the other
  forty-two, the jolly-boat twenty-two, and the gig fourteen; in
  all, a hundred and twenty-three persons. The wind increased as
  the day advanced, and became so violent that it seemed almost by
  a miracle that the boats were enabled to resist the fury of the
  storm. In the afternoon the danger increased, and the men were
  obliged to heave overboard the remainder of their bread <a name=
  "Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>and water, and never for an instant
  could they relax in their efforts to keep the boats free from
  water. God in His mercy preserved those who had shown such trust
  in Him; for we can scarcely suppose that such noble acts of
  humanity, courage, and self-sacrifice as were evinced by these
  men could arise from other than the highest and holiest
  principles.</p>

  <p>Before the evening closed in, they caught a glimpse of the
  land, but too distant for them to make out what part of the coast
  it was. The boats were hove to for the night, and a dreary night
  it was to these poor men. They were without food, almost without
  clothing, weak from want of nourishment, and exhausted by
  fatigue; and in this miserable state they awaited the break of
  day, the rain falling in torrents, and the sea breaking over the
  boats.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 28th, they again made sail, and landed
  the same evening in a small cove of a bay between Vieux Cap
  Fran&ccedil;ois and Cap Cabron. Here, to their bitter
  disappointment, they could get nothing to eat&mdash;not even a
  spring of fresh water could be found,&mdash;and all the
  nourishment they had that night was a few limpets, and the rain
  water that had remained in the holes of the rocks,&mdash;sorry
  fare for men who had been exposed to the inclemency of the
  weather for two days and two nights, in open boats, without
  food.</p>

  <p>However, it was a great thing to be on shore; for many of the
  people had suffered severely from being so closely stowed in the
  bottom of the boats, and their limbs had been terribly cramped.
  They now wisely endeavoured to make themselves as comfortable as
  circumstances allowed, by lighting a fire to keep off the
  insects, and to dry their clothes, and then they composed
  themselves to sleep, which they much needed. The next morning,
  being somewhat refreshed, they started across the bay to a place
  called Margante, which they reached <a name="Page_193" id=
  "Page_193"></a>about eight o'clock. Here they found the people
  well disposed towards them, and they were able to purchase some
  beef and plantains, and plenty of good water, of which they all
  gladly partook. The inhabitants informed them that it was
  probable they might find a vessel at Port Plata that could take
  them to St. Thomas's, that being the nearest port where they were
  likely to fall in with any of His Majesty's ships. On the 30th of
  June, they departed from Margante, taking with them a pilot, to
  guide them to Port Plata. In order to ease the boats, Captain
  Bertram and part of the ship's company walked along the shore.
  Towards evening, the people had gone upwards of twenty miles, and
  were so exhausted, they were obliged to put into a small bay
  called Scott's Bay (B. Ecossaise), where they came on shore and
  erected a tent, with the sails of the boats and a few logs of
  mahogany. With the help of some turtle, the whole of the ship's
  company were supplied with food; and they remained on shore till
  the next morning, when the boats were again launched, and all the
  party embarked in them, as there was no way along the beech. They
  arrived safely at Port Plata at eleven o'clock that night, and
  were received with great kindness and humanity. Three houses were
  provided for the men and one for the officers, and everything was
  done that could alleviate their sufferings. Unfortunately there
  was no vessel at Port Plata large enough to convey them to St.
  Thomas's. With some difficulty, a boat was procured, in which
  Lieutenant Price was despatched to Turk's Island, with a letter
  to the naval officer there, describing the situation of the crew
  of the Persian, and requesting that assistance might be afforded
  to Lieutenant Price to enable him to hire a vessel to take the
  crew to St. Thomas's.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Price made a successful voyage, and returned to
  Port Plata on the 10th of July, with the <a name="Page_194" id=
  "Page_194"></a>government schooner Swift, and a hired sloop.
  Three days were spent in fitting out these vessels with the
  necessary stores, and on the evening of the 13th, the ship's
  company, to the number of 112, embarked in them, and arrived at
  St. Thomas's on the 22nd. The crew was by this time in a very
  sickly state; the crowded state of the ships had engendered a
  complaint of which the surgeon died an hour after they cast
  anchor; and there is little doubt that had they been forty-eight
  hours longer on their passage, many others would have fallen
  victims to the same disease. At St. Thomas's, the sufferers
  received the care and attention they required, and were sent home
  to England.</p>

  <p>We cannot conclude this account without quoting the following
  passage from the narrative of Captain Bertram:&mdash;'I most
  justly attribute the preservation of the ship's company to very
  great coolness and persevering exertions of both officers and
  men, in keeping the boats free from the water they shipped, and
  their great attention in steering before the sea. I am happy to
  say that every man behaved with a regularity that is seldom found
  on similar occasions: in fact, when the little clothing the
  people had saved, and the remaining bread and water, were from
  necessity ordered to be thrown overboard, there was not a
  murmur,&mdash;they vied with each other who should obey the order
  first.'</p>

  <p>In the year 1808, Captain Bertram, then a lieutenant, was
  appointed to the Emerald, a 36-gun frigate, commanded by Captain
  the Honourable Frederick Maitland. On the 13th of March, they
  were off the harbour of Vivero, when a large French schooner was
  discovered at anchor, under the protection of the batteries.
  Captain Maitland determined to attempt to capture or destroy her,
  and accordingly he stood in for the harbour at about five o'clock
  in the evening. The first fort, which <a name="Page_195" id=
  "Page_195"></a>mounted eight 24-pounders, opened on the ship, as
  did also another fort about a mile higher up, as soon as the
  frigate came within range. As it was impossible to place the ship
  in a position to act upon both batteries, Captain Maitland
  ordered Lieutenant Bertram, with a party of marines and seamen,
  to storm the outer fort, whilst he took the ship as near the
  inner fort as the water would allow. Mr. Bertram succeeded in
  driving the enemy from the battery, and spiking the guns; he then
  made the best of his way by the shore to take possession of the
  schooner, which had been run upon the rocks. He was joined by Mr.
  Baird, a midshipman, who had been sent with a party for the same
  purpose. On the road they were met by a part of the schooner's
  crew, consisting of about sixty men. These were speedily assailed
  by the two young officers and their men, and put to flight.
  Lieutenant Bertram then advanced towards the schooner, which
  proved to be L'Apropos, of twelve 8-pounder carronades, and he
  persevered for several hours in his attempts to get her afloat,
  under a galling fire of musketry from the shore. All his efforts,
  however, were of no avail, as she had gone on shore at high
  water; it therefore became necessary to set her on fire, which
  was done; and the lieutenant returned with his party to the
  Emerald.</p>

  <p>In this gallant exploit, nine men belonging to the Emerald
  were killed, and Lieutenant Bertram and several others
  wounded.</p>

  <p>Captain Bertram, has lately accepted the rank of Retired
  Rear-Admiral.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_PENELOPE" id="THE_PENELOPE"></a><a name=
  "Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>THE PENELOPE.</h2>

  <p>We have now to relate the painful statement of a wreck, which
  was not only one of the most disastrous, but the most disgraceful
  in its consequences, of any that we have had to describe.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the loss of the ship is not the darkest side of
  the picture; and the insubordination of the crew of the Penelope
  in the hour of danger was as fatal to themselves as it was rare
  in its occurrence.</p>

  <p>The Penelope, troop-ship, Commander James Galloway, sailed
  from Spithead for Canada on the 31st of March, 1815, and had a
  favourable passage to the Banks of Newfoundland. Here she fell in
  with large masses of ice, fogs, and strong south-east winds, so
  that the captain considered it unsafe to run in for the land
  until the weather cleared up. On the 24th of April, they made the
  Island of Mequilon, and at the same time encountered a very heavy
  gale from the north-west. On the following day they were
  surrounded with ice, and were frozen up for nearly twelve hours.
  When the ice gave way, all sail was set, and the ship entered the
  Gulf of St. Lawrence, and for the next few days she continued her
  course in a north-easterly direction, and passed between the
  Islands of Brion and Magdalen. The frost during this time was so
  severe, that the furled sails were frozen into a solid body.</p>

  <p>On the 29th, they met with large quantities of field ice,
  which gave the sea the appearance of one entire sheet of ice, but
  it was not strong enough to stop the ship's way. In the afternoon
  of that day, the land about Cape Rozier, on the coast of Lower
  Canada, was visible.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>On the 30th, the weather
  was more moderate, though cloudy; at noon they steered an
  eastward course, until the ship broke off about three points,
  when at sunset they tacked, and stood in for the land, which was
  set by the first lieutenant and the master, at three or four
  leagues distance.</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock, they sounded in seventy-one fathoms; the
  vessel broke off to the west by north, and the captain ordered
  the master to go round the ship, and caution the men forward to
  keep a good look out,&mdash;at the same time desiring him on no
  account to leave the deck. The captain then sent for the
  first-lieutenant into his cabin, and was in the act of pointing
  out to him the supposed situation of the vessel on the chart; the
  line was at the same moment passing forward for another cast of
  the lead, when the ship took the ground.</p>

  <p>'I cannot describe my feelings,' writes Captain Galloway, 'at
  that moment; for having, for a long time, been almost deprived of
  my eyesight by night, and also afflicted with rheumatic pains and
  other complaints, I was unable to judge correctly of the extent
  of our danger.' The helm was immediately put down, and the sails
  thrown aback. One boat was then hoisted out to sound, and found
  two and a half fathoms forward, and about three and a half
  fathoms aft, having six fathoms a little on the starboard
  quarter.</p>

  <p>All the boats were immediately lowered, and the stream-anchor
  and cable, with part of the messenger bent on to it, stowed in
  the pinnace, which, from the strength of the current, was with
  great difficulty towed to leeward by the other boats, and dropped
  into five and a-half fathoms water.</p>

  <p>On heaving round, the anchor came home, which it continued to
  do until more than half of the cable was run in, when it held
  fast, but without altering the posi<a name="Page_198" id=
  "Page_198"></a>tion of the vessel. The captain then gave orders
  to heave overboard the guns, and cut away the anchors from the
  bows; but all these attempts to lighten the vessel were of no
  avail. The wind, which had been moderate when she first struck,
  had increased to a gale, and the ship beat with such violence
  upon the rocks, that it appeared impossible that she could hold
  together many hours.</p>

  <p>In this condition they were obliged to remain until daylight,
  exposed to a cold north-east wind, and a pitiless storm of sleet
  and snow. The officers did all in their power to sustain the
  courage of the men, but unfortunately in many instances without
  success. Already symptoms of insubordination had exhibited
  themselves, several had skulked below to their hammocks, where
  they remained in defiance of every command and entreaty of their
  officers.</p>

  <p>The topmasts were got over side to shore the ship up, but the
  motion was so violent that the lashings gave way. At daylight, as
  the weather did not moderate, and there was no prospect of saving
  the ship, orders were given to get up the provisions. This,
  however, had been delayed until it was too late; the water had
  risen over the orlop deck, and in a short time gained the lower
  deck. All that was saved was thirty bags of biscuits, and these
  so damaged by the salt water, that they were totally unfit for
  use.</p>

  <p>The masts were about this time cut away, in order to ease the
  ship as much as possible; they fell towards the shore about a
  cable's length from the beach. The master was sent in the cutter
  to try to fasten a rope to the shore, but the surf ran so high
  that the boat was stove, and the crew with difficulty gained the
  beach.</p>

  <p>In this condition, with very little prospect of saving the
  lives of the crew, the captain, anxious for the <a name=
  "Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>preservation of the public dispatches,
  entrusted them to the purser, who, with Captain Moray
  (aide-de-camp to Lieut. General Sir George Murray), in charge of
  the military dispatches, embarked in the life-boat, to which a
  small line was attached. They had, however, no better success
  than the other boat, for as soon as they reached the surf, the
  boat capsized, and the two officers swam to the shore with the
  dispatches tied round their necks.</p>

  <p>Another cutter was then sent off in hopes that she would be
  more successful, but she filled almost immediately; and the rope
  which was fastened to her was obliged to be abandoned.</p>

  <p>By this time it was impossible to stand upon the deck, the sea
  made a fair breach over the ship, and the water having rushed
  into the cabin, the few bags of bread that had been stowed there
  for protection were destroyed.</p>

  <p>The captain being unable from ill health to make any great
  exertion to save his life, was lowered into the pinnace, into
  which were already crowded as many men as she could hold, and
  they took another rope on board, to make a last attempt to form a
  communication with the shore. The boat had scarcely left the side
  of the ship before a sea struck and upset her. The captain,
  supported by two men, made his way through the surf with great
  difficulty and got on shore, followed by the rest of the boat's
  crew, who, some by swimming and others by help of oars and spars,
  saved themselves from destruction. The gig was now the only boat
  left on board; she was lowered from the stern, and the first and
  second lieutenants, with eighteen men, jumped into her. They were
  all fortunate enough to reach the shore, and some of the men
  gallantly returned to the vessel, and succeeded in landing about
  twenty others. Again, the gig repaired to the wreck, and took off
  some more of <a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>the crew, but
  this time she was unfortunately upset in the surf, though no
  lives were lost.</p>

  <p>When the men left on the wreck saw themselves thus deprived of
  the last chance of escape, they raised the most piteous cries for
  assistance, although they knew that their comrades had no means
  of affording it. It has been said that 'man is a bundle of
  inconsistencies,' and here was a proof of the assertion. These
  were in all probability the very men who had betaken themselves
  to their hammocks a short time before, and had refused to assist
  in providing for their own safety; they had disobeyed orders, and
  despised discipline, and now we find them imploring others for
  that deliverance which they had neglected to provide for
  themselves. Most of them had been drinking the spirits, and were
  so stupified that they were incapable of taking advantage of the
  floating spars and planks to which they might have clung, and so
  gained the land.</p>

  <p>By drunkenness the bed of the ocean has been rendered a foul
  and gloomy charnel house, where the bones of thousands of our
  fellow-men await the summons of the Archangel's trumpets, when
  'the sea shall give up her dead.' The reckless seamen, though
  unprepared for another world, hurry themselves into the presence
  of their Judge, to meet the drunkard's doom.</p>

  <p>It has been related that upon one occasion, when the shipwreck
  of a large packet seemed inevitable, the sailors grew tired of
  working at the pumps, and shouted 'to the spirit-room!' They saw
  death staring them in the face, and to drown their terror for the
  moment, they desired to die drunk. A post-captain in the navy,
  who was on board the packet, knowing what would be the result if
  they got at the spirits, took his stand at the door of the
  spirit-room, with a pistol in each hand, and declared in the most
  solemn manner, that he would shoot the first man who attempted to
  enter. The men seeing them<a name="Page_201" id=
  "Page_201"></a>selves defeated, returned to the pumps, and by the
  blessing of God, the vessel was brought in safe with all her
  crew.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

  <p>Unfortunate as was the situation of the helpless creatures on
  the wreck of the Penelope, it was only a few degrees more
  wretched than that of the officers and men on the shore. They had
  been cast at the base of a steep mountain, bruised and benumbed
  by the cold; their clothes were actually freezing on their backs,
  and they were without provisions of any kind. Their first care
  was to search for wood and kindle fires, which they at last
  succeeded in doing, and then they dried their clothes&mdash;but
  before they could derive any benefit from the fire, the intensity
  of cold had caused many of them extreme suffering; they were
  frost-bitten in the hands and feet, and several lost their toes.
  Some of the people were employed in constructing a tent with
  branches of trees and blankets, others were searching for
  provisions and securing such articles as were washed on shore
  from the ship. In the evening, they found about sixty pieces of
  pork,&mdash;and with this and some melted snow they satisfied the
  cravings of hunger and thirst. Later in the evening several casks
  of wine, which had been stowed in the ward-room, were washed on
  shore; but this, which might have proved a blessing to all, was
  seized by a party of the men,&mdash;who broke open the casks and
  drank to such an excess that they fell asleep, and were found
  almost frozen to death. During the whole of the day the unhappy
  men upon the wreck had never ceased supplicating their more
  fortunate comrades to go to their assistance, but this was
  impossible; no human effort could save them. As night drew on,
  their cries were redoubled, and were still heard far above the
  <a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>howling and roaring of the
  tempest, when darkness had hidden the ill-fated vessel from view.
  About twelve o'clock three fearful crashes were followed by a
  still more fearful sound&mdash;the last agonized shriek of many
  perishing creatures.</p>

  <div class="poem">

      wild and remorseless dash<br /></span> <span>Of billows.

  </div>

  <p>At daylight, the remains of the Penelope were again visible,
  but in three separate pieces; all that were left on board had
  perished, save one man, who was washed on shore nearly
  lifeless.</p>

  <p>The sufferings of these poor wretches must have been awful in
  the extreme, for their agonies of mind appear to have surpassed
  those of the body, and to have prolonged their lives by
  preventing them falling into the torpor which precedes death from
  cold. So severe was the frost, that the wreck had the appearance
  of huge masses of ice; and on shore nothing but the very large
  fires that were kept burning could have preserved the existence
  of the rest of the crew.</p>

  <p>Upon the ship breaking up, the spirits floated on shore, when
  there ensued such a scene of tumult and insubordination as,
  happily for the honour of the service, seldom occurs in the
  British navy. The men broke open the casks, and before the
  officers were aware of it, scarcely a man was to be seen sober.
  This brought with it its own punishment; many had drank to such a
  degree that they fell lifeless in the snow. The officers then
  caused the remainder of the rum to be stove, excepting a certain
  quantity placed under their own care; but when discipline is once
  broken, it is not easily restored. The next day, forty-eight men
  deserted, after plundering several of their shipmates, and
  breaking open every trunk that was washed up. These paid the
  <a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>penalty of their crimes, for
  many of them were found dead in the woods by the Canadians.</p>

  <p>We cannot do better than take up the account which is thus
  given by one of the surviving officers:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'With the remaining part of the crew the boats were hauled up,
  which we began to repair the best way we could. Sails were made
  from a lower and topmast studding-sail, which were fortunately
  washed ashore; a cask of flour was also found, a part of which
  was made into dough, and preparations were made to proceed to
  Quebec.</p>

  <p>'On the third day, a Canadian boat was passing, when the
  captain ordered her to be detained to proceed to that port. With
  the assistance of the cooking utensils found in the Canadian
  boat, all the pork that could be found was cooked and served out
  to the different boats, which was a very short allowance for two
  days.</p>

  <p>'On the sixth day of our misery, the weather moderated, the
  boats were launched, and all hands embarked; sixty-eight persons
  in all, including two women. The wind was favourable, but light;
  with rowing and sailing, we got to Great Fox River that night, at
  which place we were hospitably entertained with potatoes and salt
  at a Canadian hut. Next morning we sailed for Gasper Bay, and
  reached Douglas Town in the evening.</p>

  <p>'The captain and officers were accommodated at Mr. Johnston's,
  and the crew lodged at the different huts around the place. After
  three days' rest, we walked nine miles over the ice to where the
  transports lay; leaving the sick at Douglas Town. The captain
  hoisted his pendant on board the Ann, transport, and put a
  lieutenant in each of the others, and an equal number of men.
  When the ice broke up, which was seven days after we got on
  board, we dropped down to Douglas <a name="Page_204" id=
  "Page_204"></a>Town, and embarked the sick, one of whom died, and
  two deserted. The next morning we sailed for Quebec, where we
  arrived on the 28th, many of us not having a change of clothes of
  any description.'</p>

  <p>In concluding the above narrative of the loss of this vessel,
  we will quote the language of Captain Galloway, who thus
  deprecates, in strong terms, the disgraceful conduct of the
  majority of the crew of the Penelope:&mdash;'I feel it my duty,'
  he says, 'to state to you the infamous conduct of the whole of
  the crew, with a very few exceptions. From the time that the ship
  struck, their behaviour was not in the character of British
  seamen in general; they had neither principle nor humanity; some,
  in consequence, have suffered severely, and several died from
  drunkenness.'</p>

  <p>Captain Galloway died in 1846.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_ALCESTE" id="THE_ALCESTE"></a>THE ALCESTE.</h2>

  <p>At the close of 1815, the Court of Directors of the East India
  Company having represented to the British Government the
  impediments thrown in the way of our trade with China, by the
  impositions practised by the local authorities at Canton, it was
  determined to send an embassy to the court of Pekin.</p>

  <p>Lord Amherst was selected to undertake the mission, and Mr.
  Henry Ellis was appointed secretary to the embassy.</p>

  <p>The Alceste, a frigate of 46 guns, under the command of
  Captain, afterwards Sir Murray Maxwell, was fitted up for the
  reception of the ambassador and his suite.</p>

  <p>On the 9th of February, 1816, the expedition sailed <a name=
  "Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>from Spithead, and arrived in the
  China seas about the middle of July following. It is not in our
  province to give any account of the proceedings of the embassy,
  which have already been so ably described, and are well
  known.</p>

  <p>His excellency, having accomplished the object of his mission,
  took his departure from China on the 9th of January, 1817,
  arrived at Manilla on the 3rd of February, and finally sailed
  from thence in the Alceste, on the 9th of the same month.</p>

  <p>Captain Maxwell directed the ship's course to be steered
  towards the Straits of Gaspar, in preference to those of Banca,
  as affording, at that period of the monsoon, the most convenient
  and speedy egress from the China seas; and though this passage is
  not so often taken as that of Banca, the Gaspar Straits appeared
  by the plans and surveys laid down in the Admiralty charts, as
  well as in those of the East India Company, to be, not only
  wider, but to have a much greater depth of water, and to offer
  fewer difficulties to navigation.</p>

  <p>Early on the morning of the 18th of February, they made the
  Island of Gaspar, and in a short time, Pulo Leat, or Middle
  Island, was descried from the mast-head. The weather was
  remarkably fine and clear,&mdash;a mild breeze blowing from the
  north-west, and the surface of the water gently agitated by the
  current, which perpetually sets through the straits, either to
  the south-east or south-west, according to the monsoon.</p>

  <p>The sea, which is usually so clear in these climates, had been
  greatly discoloured that morning by a quantity of fish spawn, a
  circumstance of not unfrequent occurrence in those seas; and the
  navigation being thus rendered more dangerous, unusual
  precautions were taken for ensuring the safety of the ship. A man
  was stationed at the foretopmast head, and others at the <a name=
  "Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>fore-yardarms. Captain Maxwell, with
  the master and other officers, was upon deck, 'steering, under
  all these guarded circumstances,' (writes an eye-witness,) 'the
  soundings corresponding so exactly with the charts, and following
  the express line prescribed by all concurring directions, to
  clear every danger,&mdash;and it was the last danger of this sort
  between us and England,&mdash;when the ship, about half-past
  seven in the morning, struck with a horrid crash on a reef of
  sunken rocks, and remained immoveable.' 'What my feelings were,'
  says Captain Maxwell, 'at this momentary transition from a state
  of perfect security to all the horrors of a shipwreck, I will not
  venture to depict; but I must acknowledge, it required whatever
  mental energy I possessed to control them, and to enable me to
  give with coolness and firmness the necessary orders preparatory
  to abandoning the ship,&mdash;which a very short period of hard
  working at all the pumps showed the impracticability of
  saving.'</p>

  <p>The carpenter very soon reported the water above the tanks in
  the main hold, and in a few minutes more, over the orlop
  deck.</p>

  <p>The quarter boats had been instantly lowered to sound, and
  reported deep water all round the reef, ten fathoms immediately
  under the stern, and seventeen about a quarter of a cable further
  off,&mdash;so that it was but too evident that the preservation
  of the crew depended solely upon the vessel's remaining fast
  where she was.</p>

  <p>The first care of Captain Maxwell was for the safety of Lord
  Amherst and his suite; the boats were quickly hoisted out, and
  before half-past eight, he had the melancholy satisfaction of
  seeing the ambassador and all his attendants safely embarked in
  them.</p>

  <p>For the better protection of the embassy, an officer was sent
  in the barge, with a guard of marines, to conduct them to Pulo
  Leat, between three and four miles <a name="Page_207" id=
  "Page_207"></a>distant, and from which it was hoped that plenty
  of water and abundance of tropical fruits might be procured.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the officers and men exerted themselves most
  indefatigably to save some of the provisions,&mdash;a task by no
  means easy of accomplishment, as the holds and everything in them
  were submerged in water. Towards the afternoon, the boats
  returned from the shore, and the men reported that they had had
  great difficulty in landing his excellency, from the mangrove
  trees growing out to a considerable distance in the water; and it
  was not until they had pulled three or four miles from the place
  where they first attempted to land that they were enabled to
  reach terra firma. They also stated that neither food nor water
  could be discovered on the island. Unpromising as appearances
  were, there was no alternative but to seek shelter on the
  inhospitable shore. Accordingly, every preparation was made, and
  by eight o'clock P.M., the people were all landed, excepting one
  division, who remained on board the wreck, with the captain,
  first lieutenant, and some other officers.</p>

  <p>About midnight, the wind had greatly increased, and the ship
  became so uneasy from her heeling to windward, that fears were
  entertained for the safety of those on board. To prevent her
  falling further over, the topmasts were cut away, and as the wind
  became more moderate towards daylight, the ship remained
  stationary, and all apprehensions were removed. The boats did not
  return to the wreck till between six and seven o'clock in the
  morning, and they brought no better tidings as to the
  capabilities of the island to furnish food and other necessaries
  for the subsistence of so many human beings.</p>

  <p>A raft had been constructed during the previous day, upon
  which the small quantity of provisions they had been able to
  collect, together with some of the bag<a name="Page_208" id=
  "Page_208"></a>gage of the embassy, and clothes and bedding of
  the officers and men, had been transported to the shore.</p>

  <p>In the course of the forenoon, Captain Maxwell thought it
  right to confer with Lord Amherst as to his further movements; he
  accordingly quitted the wreck, and went on shore. He left the
  vessel in charge of Mr. Hick, the first lieutenant, with orders
  that every effort should be made to get at the provisions and the
  water, and that a boat should remain by the wreck for the safety
  of the men in case of any emergency. Captain Maxwell reached the
  shore about half-past eleven A.M., and we may imagine the
  bitterness of his distress on finding the ambassador, surrounded
  by his suite, and the officers and men of the Alceste, in the
  midst of a pestilential saltwater marsh.</p>

  <p>The scene is well described by Mr. McLeod. 'The spot in which
  our party were situated was sufficiently romantic, but seemed, at
  the same time, the abode of ruin and of havoc. Few of its
  inhabitants (and among the rest the ambassador) had now more than
  a shirt or a pair of trousers on. The wreck of books, or, as it
  was not unaptly termed, 'a literary manure,' was spread about in
  all directions; whilst parliamentary robes, court dresses, and
  mandarin habits, intermixed with check shirts and tarry jackets,
  were hung around in wild confusion on every tree.'</p>

  <p>The situation in which Captain Maxwell was placed was, indeed,
  a most trying one, and such he felt it to be, for, from the
  lowest seaman to the ambassador himself, every one looked to him
  for relief and direction in his perilous position. Captain
  Maxwell was fully competent to meet the emergency; and, said he,
  'I had the consolation left me, to feel with confidence that all
  would follow my advice, and abide by my decision, whatever it
  might be.'</p>

  <p><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>His first care was for
  the safety of Lord Amherst; and in a short conference with his
  excellency and Mr. Ellis, the second commissioner, it was
  arranged that the embassy should proceed to Batavia in the barge
  and cutter, with a guard of marines to defend the boats from any
  attack of the pirates. Mr. Ellis promised that if they arrived
  safely at Batavia, he would himself return, in the first vessel
  that should put off, to the assistance of those who remained on
  the island.</p>

  <p>A small quantity of provisions, and nine gallons of water, was
  all that could be spared from their very scanty store; but at
  sunset every heart was exhilarated by hope and sympathetic
  courage, on seeing the ambassador strip, and wade off to the
  boats, with as much cheerfulness as if he had stepped into them
  under a salute. At seven o'clock, the barge, under the charge of
  Lieutenant Hoppner, and the cutter, commanded by Mr. Mayne, the
  master, containing in all forty-seven persons, took their
  departure for Batavia, accompanied by the anxious thoughts and
  good wishes of their fellow-sufferers, who were left to encounter
  new dangers.</p>

  <p>Captain Maxwell's first order was to direct a party to dig in
  search of water. The men had begun to suffer greatly from thirst,
  as for the last two days they had had scarcely a pint of water
  each&mdash;one small cask only having been saved from the ship.
  The next step was to remove their encampment to higher ground,
  where they could breathe a purer air, and be in greater safety in
  case of attack.</p>

  <p>In a short time the island presented a scene of bustle and
  activity strangely at variance with the dreary solitude it had
  exhibited two days before; and the once silent woods resounded
  with the voices of men, and the strokes of the axe and the
  hammer. One party was employed in cutting a path to the summit of
  the hill, <a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>another in
  removing thither their small stock of provisions. A few men were
  on board the wreck, endeavouring to save every article that might
  prove of general use.</p>

  <p>About midnight, the men who had been employed for so many
  hours on a most fatiguing and harassing duty, and exposed to the
  burning rays of a vertical sun, began to suffer most painfully
  from increased thirst, and it was at that moment when they were
  almost bereft of hope that they experienced one of the many
  merciful interpositions of Providence by which the Almighty
  displays His tender care for His creatures: a plentiful shower of
  rain fell, which the people caught by spreading out their table
  cloths and clothes; and then, by wringing them, a degree of
  moisture was imparted to their parched lips, and their hearts
  were revived, and prepared to hear the joyful news, which was
  communicated by the diggers soon after midnight, that they had
  found water in the well, and a small bottle of this most dearly
  prized treasure was handed to the captain. So great was the
  excitement of the people on receiving the announcement, that it
  became necessary to plant sentries, in order to prevent their
  rushing to the well and impeding the work of the diggers.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 20th, the captain called all hands
  together, and pointed out to them the critical nature of their
  position, and the absolute necessity of their uniting as one man
  to overcome the difficulties by which they were surrounded. He
  reminded them that they were still amenable to the regulations of
  naval discipline, and assured them that discipline would be
  enforced with even greater rigour, if necessary, than on board
  ship; and that in serving out the provisions the strictest
  impartiality should be observed, and all should share alike until
  the arrival of assistance from Lord Amherst.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>During this day, the well
  afforded a pint of water to each man; the water is said to have
  tasted like milk and water, and when a little rum was added to
  it, the men persuaded themselves it resembled milk-punch, and it
  became a favourite beverage with them.</p>

  <p>The people were employed during the 20th much in the same
  manner as on the previous day, but very few things could be
  obtained from the ship, every article of value being under
  water.</p>

  <p>On Friday, the 21st, the party stationed on board the wreck
  observed a number of proahs full of Malays, apparently well
  armed, coming towards them. Being without a single weapon of
  defence, they could only jump into their boats without loss of
  time, and push for the land. The pirates followed closely in
  pursuit but retreated when they saw two boats put out from the
  shore to the assistance of their comrades. The Malays then
  returned to the ship and took possession of her. In an instant
  all was activity and excitement in the little camp.</p>

  <p>'Under all the depressing circumstances attending shipwreck,'
  writes Mr. McLeod, 'of hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and menaced
  by a ruthless foe, it was glorious to see the British spirit
  stanch and unsubdued. The order was given for every man to arm
  himself in the best manner he could, and it was obeyed with the
  utmost promptitude and alacrity. Rude pike staves were formed by
  cutting down young trees; small swords, dirks, knives, chisels,
  and even large spike nails sharpened, were firmly fixed to the
  ends of these poles, and those who could find nothing better
  hardened the end of the wood in the fire, and bringing it to a
  sharp point, formed a tolerable weapon. There were, perhaps, a
  dozen cutlasses; the marines had about thirty muskets and
  bayonets; but we could muster no more than seventy-five ball
  cartridges among the whole party.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>'We had fortunately
  preserved some loose powder, drawn from the upper deck guns after
  the ship had struck (for the magazines were under water in five
  minutes,) and the marines, by hammering their buttons round, and
  by rolling up pieces of broken bottles in cartridges, did their
  best to supply themselves with a sort of shot that would have
  some effect at close quarters, and strict orders were given not
  to throw away a single discharge until sure of their aim.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Cheffy, the carpenter, and his crew, under the direction
  of the captain, were busied in forming a sort of abattis by
  felling trees, and enclosing in a circular shape the ground we
  occupied; and by interweaving loose branches with the stakes
  driven in among these, a breast-work was constructed, which
  afforded us some cover, and must naturally impede the progress of
  any enemy unsupplied with artillery.'</p>

  <p>The Malays had taken possession of some rocks, at no great
  distance from where the crew of the Alceste were encamped, and
  here they deposited the plunder they had taken from the wreck. It
  now became necessary for Captain Maxwell to prepare against an
  attack. With a very small stock of provisions, which, even if
  husbanded with the greatest care, could last only a few days, he
  had to contend, with a handful of men, many of them unarmed,
  against a host of savages, perhaps the most merciless and inhuman
  that are to be found in any part of the world.</p>

  <p>In the evening a general muster was called, and a rude and
  motley group presented itself to the eye of the commander. But
  rough as was the exterior, he well knew that there was that
  within which would bid defiance to danger and outrage so long as
  life should last.</p>

  <p>So stanch and resolute was the spirit diffused through all the
  little band, that Mr. McLeod says,&mdash;'Even the <a name=
  "Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>boys had managed to make fast
  table-forks on the end of sticks for their defence. One of them,
  who had been severely bruised by the falling of the masts, and
  was slung in his hammock between two trees, had been observed
  carefully fixing, with two sticks and a rope yarn, the blade of
  an old razor. On being asked what he meant to do with it, he
  replied, 'You know I cannot stand, but if any of these fellows
  come within reach of my hammock, I'll mark them.'</p>

  <p>The officers and men were divided into companies, and every
  precaution adopted to secure the slender garrison from being
  taken by surprise. The boats were hauled closer up to the
  landing-place, and put under the charge of an officer and
  guard.</p>

  <p>On Saturday morning, the 22nd, every effort was made to induce
  the Malays to come to an amicable conference, but without
  success. Mr. Hay, the second lieutenant, was, therefore, ordered
  to proceed to the ship, with the barge, cutter, and gig, (armed
  in the best manner possible under the circumstances,) and to gain
  possession of her by fair means or by force. No sooner did the
  pirates see the boats put out towards the wreck, than they left
  the vessel, though not before they had set fire to her, thus
  performing an act which was of great service to the crew of the
  Alceste; for by burning her upperworks and decks, everything
  buoyant could float up from below and be more easily laid hold
  of. The ship continued to burn during the night, and the flames,
  as they darted from her sides, shed a ruddy glare upon the wild
  scenery around, and breaking through the shade of the thick and
  lofty trees rested upon a landscape worthy of the pencil of
  Salvator Rosa.</p>

  <p>Upon the summit of a hill, and under the spreading branches of
  the majestic trees, was a rude encampment, formed by the erection
  of a few wigwams; whilst here <a name="Page_214" id=
  "Page_214"></a>and there, collected together in groups and
  reclining in different attitudes, were parties of men armed with
  pikes or cutlasses, in their ragged, unwashed, and unshorn
  appearance, resembling rather a gang of banditti, than the crew
  of a British ship of war.</p>

  <p>It was with the most painful feelings that both officers and
  men witnessed the gradual destruction of the gallant ship, which
  had been their home for so many months.</p>

  <p>No one but a sailor can understand the devotion with which a
  brother sailor regards his ship, and we cannot better describe it
  than in the words of Captain Basil Hall:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'We do truly make the ship our home, and we have no other
  thoughts of professional duty or of happiness, but what are
  connected with the vessel in which we swim; we take a pride in
  her very looks, as we might in those of a daughter; and bring up
  her crew to honourable deeds, as we should wish to instruct our
  sons. The rate of sailing of each ship in a fleet is a subject of
  never-ending discussion amongst all classes of officers,
  midshipmen, and crews, every one of whom considers his own
  individual honour involved in all the ship does or is capable of
  doing.</p>

  <p>'This is true almost universally, but it is most striking, no
  doubt, in our first ship, which like our first love, is supposed
  to drink up from our opening feelings the richest drops of
  sentiment, never to be outdone, or even equalled by future
  attachments.</p>

  <p>'I owe, indeed, much good companionship, and many sincere
  obligations to other vessels; yet I am sure that if I live to be
  Lord High Admiral, the old Leander must still be nearest and
  dearest to my nautical heart. I remember every corner about her,
  every beam, every cabin, every gun.'</p>

  <p>The same feeling, no doubt, existed in the breast of <a name=
  "Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>every man and boy who now stood
  watching, with painful interest, the fate of the old ship; all
  had been too actively employed from the time the vessel first
  struck to think of anything save of providing means for their own
  preservation; but now, in the dead hour of night, thrown upon a
  strange shore, and surrounded by enemies, the thought, perhaps,
  that they might never again see their native land or their
  beloved kindred, might steal over their hearts, and fill them
  with sad forebodings. By degrees the fire became less and less
  vivid; for an instant, at times, a brighter flame illuminated the
  sky, throwing up a shower of golden sparks&mdash;then all was
  darkness,&mdash;a darkness which was felt by all; for it told
  that nought remained of their old home, save a smouldering
  hull,&mdash;that thus was severed, perhaps, the last link between
  them and England.</p>

  <p>During the night that followed this sad scene, an incident
  occurred which, though it occasioned considerable alarm at the
  time, became a source of amusement afterwards.</p>

  <p>A sentry, startled by the approach of a very suspicious
  looking personage, who was making towards him, levelled his
  musket and fired. In an instant the whole camp was alive with
  excitement, supposing that they were attacked by the savages,
  when; behold, the enemy turned out to be a large baboon, one of a
  race that abounded in the island. These creatures became very
  troublesome; they were most audacious thieves, and even carried
  away several ducks which had been saved from the wreck; till at
  last the poor birds were so frightened that they left their
  little enclosure and voluntarily sought for safety and protection
  amongst the people.</p>

  <p>From the morning of Sunday, the 23rd, till Wednesday, the
  26th, the men were busied in saving whatever they could from the
  hull of the Alceste, and they <a name="Page_216" id=
  "Page_216"></a>were fortunate enough to obtain several casks of
  flour, a few cases of wine, and a cask of beer, besides between
  fifty and sixty boarding-pikes, and eighteen muskets, all of
  which proved most acceptable.</p>

  <p>A second well had been sunk, which supplied clearer water, and
  in great abundance, so that they possessed one of the chief
  necessaries of life in plenty.</p>

  <p>Everything now wore a more favourable aspect. The Malays had
  retired behind a little island (called Palo Chalacca, or
  Misfortune's Isle), about two miles distant; and although they
  were expected to return speedily with a reinforcement, the crew
  of the Alceste were better prepared for them. The gunner had been
  actively employed in forming musket cartridges; and, by melting
  down some pewter basons and jugs, with a small quantity of lead
  obtained from the wreck, balls had been cast, in clay moulds,
  which not a little increased their confidence and feeling of
  security.</p>

  <p>Under the able command of Captain Maxwell, the greatest
  regularity and order prevailed amongst the people. Every man
  appeared happy and contented with his lot; for each man, from the
  highest to the lowest, encouraged his neighbour by his own good
  conduct, whilst he in turn received encouragement from the
  example of those above him. The provisions were served out with
  the strictest impartiality. 'The mode adopted by Captain
  Maxwell,' (writes Mr. M'Leod,) 'to make things go as far as
  possible, was to chop up the allowance for the day into small
  pieces, whether fowls, salt beef, pork, or flour, mixing the
  whole hotch-potch, boiling them together, and serving out a
  measure to each publicly and openly, and without any distinction.
  By these means no nourishment was lost: it could be more equally
  divided than by any other way; and although necessarily a scanty,
  it was by no means an unsavoury mess.'</p>

  <p><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>Early on Wednesday
  morning, Lieutenant Hay, who had charge of the boats, observed
  two pirate proahs nearing the island, as if to reconnoitre; he
  immediately made a dash at them, with the barge, cutter, and gig.
  The barge closed with the Malays first, and a desperate conflict
  ensued. There was only one musket in the boat, which Mr. Hay used
  to some purpose, for he killed two of the savages with his own
  hand. In the meantime, the other two boats had come up to the
  assistance of their comrades. One more pirate was shot dead, and
  another knocked down with the butt-end of a musket; yet the rest
  continued to fight with savage ferocity, until, seeing that
  resistance was fruitless, they jumped into the sea and drowned
  themselves, choosing to perish rather than yield. During the
  engagement, an officer who was on the beach, observed a canoe,
  which had been cut away from one of the proahs, drifting not many
  yards from the spot where he stood; and as he thought the prize
  worth securing, he entered the water, and swam towards it. He had
  nearly attained his object, when those who watched him from the
  shore perceived an enormous shark hovering about. They were
  almost petrified with horror; anxious to make their friend aware
  of his danger, yet not daring to call out to warn him, lest a
  sudden perception of the perils of his situation, and of the
  proximity of his formidable enemy, should unnerve him, and thus
  deprive him of the slight chance of escape that remained.
  Breathless and silent then they stood, and marked the movements
  of the shark with trembling anxiety. He seemed to be so sure of
  his prey, that he was in no haste to seize it, but swam leisurely
  about, crossing and recrossing betwixt the doomed victim and the
  shore, as if gloating himself, and sharpening his appetite by
  gazing on the anticipated feast. The officer, too, seemed to be
  luxuriating in the refreshing coolness <a name="Page_218" id=
  "Page_218"></a>of the water, calmly approaching the canoe,
  happily unconscious of his danger; but the shark followed him
  closely: his life depended upon a swimmer's stroke, or the whim
  of a moment. The anxiety of the spectators became agony; but that
  moment was decisive&mdash;the swimmer struck out once
  more&mdash;the canoe was gained, and he was saved.</p>

  <p>Then, and then only, did he become aware of the horrible fate
  that had threatened him, and of the merciful interposition of
  Providence in his behalf.</p>

  <p>In the course of this day fourteen proahs and smaller boats
  were observed standing towards the island, from the Banca side,
  and every heart bounded with joy in the full anticipation that it
  was a party sent by Lord Amherst from Batavia, to their relief.
  Their joy, however, did not last long, for they soon found that
  the boats had come only to gather a kind of sea-weed much
  esteemed by Chinese epicures, who use it, as they do birds'
  nests, in their soup.</p>

  <p>Consultations were held that night as to the policy of
  negotiating with these people, so as to induce them, by promises
  of reward, to convey part of the crew of the Alceste to
  Java&mdash;the four remaining boats would then be sufficient for
  the transport of the rest.</p>

  <p>But the morning dawn put all such plans to flight, and
  revealed the true character of the Malays. No sooner did they
  perceive the wreck, than they started off to her and plundered
  the hull of everything they could carry away. No assistance was
  to be expected from these rapacious thieves; and as the time had
  elapsed which was required to bring succour from Batavia,
  measures were taken to repair the launch and to construct a raft
  to enable the people to leave the island before their provisions
  should be completely exhausted.</p>

  <p>Matters now began to assume a more formidable <a name=
  "Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>aspect, for on Saturday, the 1st of
  March, the Malay force was increased by the arrival of several
  proahs, who joined in breaking up the remains of the wreck.</p>

  <p>At daybreak on Sunday, the 2nd, the camp was alarmed, and all
  were called to arms by the yells of the savages, who, firing
  their partereroes, and beating their gongs, advanced with about
  twenty of their heaviest vessels towards the landing-place, and
  anchored within a cable's length of the shore.</p>

  <p>After a short deliberation, a boat full of men armed with
  creeses approached the shore, and was met by a canoe containing
  an officer and party with a letter from Captain Maxwell,
  addressed to the chief authority at Minto, stating the situation
  of the Alceste's crew, and praying that assistance might be sent
  to them.</p>

  <p>The officer placed this letter in the hands of the Malays,
  repeatedly pronounced the word Minto, and showed them a dollar,
  to intimate that they would be well rewarded if they returned
  with an answer. They appeared to understand the mission, and to
  be willing to execute it; but, as may be supposed, the service
  was never performed.</p>

  <p>Meantime the Malay forces continued to increase; no less than
  fifty proahs and boats of different sizes were collected, and, on
  a moderate computation, they had 500 men on board. Their
  mischievous intentions were too evident; they drew closer and
  closer to the shore, prevented the escape of any of the ship's
  boats, and even had recourse to stratagem in order to gain
  possession of the much-desired booty. One party declared that all
  the Malays except themselves were hostile, and urged that they
  might be allowed to go to the camp to guard the crew of the
  Alceste. This kind offer was of course refused. 'We can trust to
  ourselves,' was the reply. The plot began to thicken; the odds
  seemed fearfully <a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>against the
  heroic little band, who, badly armed, and worse provisioned, had
  to make good their position against a multitude of
  foes&mdash;matchless amongst savages in cunning and cruelty. But
  in proportion to the imminence of the danger rose the courage of
  our countrymen.</p>

  <p>Mr. M'Leod relates that, in the evening, when Captain Maxwell
  had assembled, as usual, the men under arms, for the purpose of
  inspecting them, he addressed them in these words: 'My lads, you
  must all have observed this day, as well as myself, the great
  increase of the enemy's force (for enemies we must now consider
  them), and the threatening position they have assumed. I have, on
  various grounds, strong reason to believe they will attack us
  this night. I do not wish to conceal our real state, because I
  think there is not a man here who is afraid to face any sort of
  danger. We are now strongly fenced in, and our position in all
  respects is so good, that armed as we are, we ought to make a
  formidable defence even against regular troops; what, then, would
  be thought of us, if we allowed ourselves to be surprised by a
  set of naked savages with their spears and their creeses?</p>

  <p>'It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot
  act here; I have not observed that they have any matchlocks or
  muskets; but if they have, so have we!</p>

  <p>'I do not wish to deceive you as to the means of resistance in
  our power. When we were first thrown together on shore we were
  almost defenceless. Seventy-five ball-cartridges only could be
  mustered; we have now sixteen hundred. They cannot, I believe,
  send up more than five hundred men, but, with two hundred such as
  now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand&mdash;nay, fifteen
  hundred of them! I have the fullest confidence that we shall beat
  them. The pikemen standing firm, <a name="Page_221" id=
  "Page_221"></a>we can give them such a volley of musketry as they
  will be little prepared for, and when we find they are thrown
  into confusion, we'll sally out among them, chase them into the
  water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. Let every man,
  therefore, be on the alert with his arms in his hands; and should
  these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall
  convince them that they are dealing with Britons!'</p>

  <p>This short but spirited appeal had its full effect upon the
  hearts to whom it was addressed. It was answered by three wild
  hurras, which were taken up by the piquets and outposts, and
  resounded through the woods. The British cheer struck the savages
  with terror; they no doubt thought it preceded an attack, and
  they were observed making signals with lights to some of their
  tribe behind the islet.</p>

  <p>The night passed undisturbed, and daylight discovered the
  pirates in the same position, their force increased by ten
  proahs, making their number at least six hundred men. The
  situation of Captain Maxwell and his party became hourly more
  critical; the provisions could not last long&mdash;something must
  be done&mdash;some plan must be decided on. They had but little
  choice; they must either make a dash at the pirates, and seize
  their boats, with the certainty of being all butchered should
  they not succeed,&mdash;and the odds were fearfully against
  them,&mdash;or they must maintain their present position, in the
  hope that aid might be sent from Java, in time to save them from
  a scarcely less horrible fate&mdash;the lingering death of
  famine.</p>

  <p>Under these depressing circumstances, the spirits of the men
  never for a moment seemed to flag. True 'hearts of oak,' their
  courage increased with their difficulties, and the prevailing
  desire amongst them was, to rush upon the enemy and get
  possession of their boats, or perish in the attempt.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>But for this day, at
  least, they were ordered to remain passive; perhaps in coming to
  this decision, the wise and brave commander of the party may have
  remembered another captain who was 'in a great strait,' and who
  said, 'Let us fall now into the hands of the Lord, for His
  mercies are great, and let me not fall into the hand of man,' The
  decision, then, was to wait; and the hours rolled on till
  afternoon, when an officer ascended one of the loftiest trees,
  and thence he thought he descried a sail at a great distance. The
  joyful news seemed too good to be true.</p>

  <p>A signal-man was sent up with a telescope, to sweep the
  horizon. The eager and intense anxiety that pervaded the little
  band, until he could report his observations, may be better
  imagined than described. At last, he announced that the object
  was indeed a brig, or a ship, standing towards the island under
  all sail. The joy was unbounded and overpowering. Men felt as if
  awaking from some horrible dream; and, doubtless, many an honest
  heart was uplifted in thankfulness to the Almighty, for the mercy
  vouchsafed in delivering them from what had appeared, a few
  minutes before, to be certain destruction.</p>

  <p>There remains little more to be told; the vessel proved to be
  the Ternate, which Lord Amherst had sent to their assistance. The
  pirates took to flight as soon as they discovered the ship, but
  not before they had received a volley from the Alceste's people,
  unfortunately without effect.</p>

  <p>It was not till Friday, the 7th of March, that all were
  embarked on board the Ternate. They arrived safely at Batavia on
  the 9th, and were most kindly received by Lord Amherst, who
  converted his table into a general mess for the officers, as well
  as the embassy; comfortable quarters were also provided for the
  men; and in their <a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>present
  enjoyment they all soon forgot the hardships they had
  suffered.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, we will quote the following passage from the
  pen of Mr. M'Leod:&mdash;'It is a tribute due to Captain Maxwell
  to state (and it is a tribute which all will most cheerfully pay)
  that, by his judicious arrangements, we were preserved from all
  the horrors of anarchy and confusion. His measures inspired
  confidence and hope, while his personal example in the hour of
  danger gave courage and animation to all around him.' Nor ought
  we to omit the high and well deserved praise which Captain
  Maxwell bestowed upon the ship's company in his examination
  before the court martial.</p>

  <p>'I should be trespassing far too long upon the time of this
  court,' said Captain Maxwell, 'were I to bring all before them
  whose conduct merited applause; but I can with great veracity
  assure the court, that from the captain to the smallest boy, all
  were animated by the spirit of Britons; and, whatever the cause
  was, I ought not to regret having been placed in a position to
  witness all the noble traits of character this extraordinary
  occasion called forth; and having seen all my companions in
  distress fairly embarked, I felt in walking off to the boat that
  my heart was lifted up with gratitude to a kind Providence that
  had watched over us.'</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Captain Murray Maxwell commenced his naval career under the
  auspices of Vice-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood, and obtained his first
  commission as lieutenant in 1796, and was subsequently promoted
  to the command of the Cyane, in December, 1802.</p>

  <p>In the following year he was appointed to the Centaur, and
  received his post commission on the 4th of August, in the same
  year. In 1804, Captain Maxwell distinguished himself at the
  capture of Surinam, and for his <a name="Page_224" id=
  "Page_224"></a>conduct on that occasion was highly mentioned in
  the dispatches.</p>

  <p>This officer was constantly employed in the late war, and
  distinguished himself on so many occasions, that we can only
  briefly allude to one or two instances where his gallantry was
  most conspicuous. In 1806, he was appointed to the Alceste, and
  on the 4th of April, 1808, whilst that vessel, in company with
  the Mercury, Captain James Alexander Gordon, and the Grasshopper,
  18-gun sloop, lay at anchor near Cadiz, a large convoy under the
  protection of several gun-boats, was seen coming close in shore
  from the northward.</p>

  <p>Captain Maxwell determined to attempt their capture, and
  accordingly, the Alceste and Mercury attacked the gun-boats,
  whilst the Grasshopper, stationed close to the batteries of Rota,
  by a well directed fire, succeeded in driving the Spaniards from
  their guns. The gun-boats being thrown into confusion, the
  first-lieutenant of the Alceste, Mr. Allen Stewart, and
  Lieutenant Watkin Owen Pell of the Mercury, volunteered to board
  the enemy in the boats. They accordingly dashed in among the
  convoy, boarded and brought out seven tartans from under the very
  muzzles of the enemy's guns, though supported by several armed
  boats sent from Cadiz to their assistance.</p>

  <p>Captain Maxwell was actively employed on the coast of Italy
  until 1811, when we find him cruizing in the Adriatic, in company
  with the Active, Captain James Alexander Gordon, and a 36-gun
  frigate, the Unit&eacute;, Captain Edward Henry Chamberlain. On
  the morning of the 28th of November, the little squadron was
  lying in Port St. George, Island of Lissa, when signals were made
  that there were three suspicious sail south. The three frigates
  immediately got under weigh, and on the morning of the 29th came
  within sight of the strange vessels, which proved to be the
  Pauline, a 40-gun frigate, <a name="Page_225" id=
  "Page_225"></a>the Pomone, frigate, and 26-gun ship, Persanne.
  The French commodore, finding the English force greater than he
  expected, bore up to the north-west, and the Persanne separated,
  and stood to the north-east. The Unit&eacute; was then despatched
  in chase of the Persanne, and the Alceste and Active continued in
  pursuit of the French frigates.</p>

  <p>In the course of a couple of hours the Alceste commenced
  action with the Pomone, but an unlucky shot soon afterwards
  brought down the main-topmast of the Alceste, and she was
  compelled to drop astern. The Active speedily ranged alongside of
  the Pomone, and after a spirited conflict, the latter ship was
  compelled to haul down her colours and surrender.</p>

  <p>The Pauline, in the meantime, tacked, and poured her fire into
  the Alceste, no doubt anticipating an easy victory from her
  disabled state; but in this she was disappointed, for the fire
  was returned with such effect, that after a warm conflict of two
  hours and twenty minutes, the commodore made off to the westward,
  which, from the crippled state of the Alceste, Captain Maxwell
  was unable to prevent. In this action the Alceste lost twenty
  killed and wounded, the Active thirty-five, and Pomone fifty. The
  gallant captain of the Active had the misfortune to lose his leg,
  and his first lieutenant, William Bateman Dashwood, had his right
  arm shot away: the command therefore fell upon the second
  lieutenant, George Haye, who fought the action, until her
  opponent surrendered.</p>

  <p>In 1813, Captain Maxwell had the misfortune to be wrecked in
  the D&aelig;dalus, and in 1815 was again reappointed to the
  Alceste. On his passage home, after the loss of that vessel, he
  touched at St. Helena, and had an interview with Napoleon
  Buonaparte, who, reminding him of the capture of the Pomone, said
  'Vous &eacute;tiez tr&egrave;s m&eacute;chant. Eh bien! your
  government <a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>must not blame
  you for the loss of the Alceste, for you have taken one of my
  frigates.'<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id=
  "FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class=
  "fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

  <p>Captain Maxwell was nominated a C.B. in 1815, and received the
  honour of knighthood in 1818.</p>

  <p>He died in June, 1831.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <h2><a name="THE_DRAKE" id="THE_DRAKE"></a>THE DRAKE.</h2>

  <p>The Drake, a small schooner, under the command of Captain
  Charles Baker, had been despatched by the commander-in-chief on
  the Newfoundland station, upon special duty to Halifax.</p>

  <p>Having accomplished the object of her mission there, she set
  sail again to return to St. John's, on the morning of Thursday,
  the 20th of June, 1822. The weather was unusually fine, the wind
  favourable, and everything promised a short and prosperous
  voyage.</p>

  <p>Nothing occurred to retard the progress of the vessel until
  Sunday morning, when the increasing thickness of the atmosphere
  betokened the approach of one of those heavy fogs which so
  frequently hover over the coast of Newfoundland.</p>

  <p>There are few things more perplexing to the mariner than to
  find himself suddenly enveloped in one of these thick mists: it
  is impenetrable gloom; night and day are both alike; the sails,
  saturated with the watery vapour, hang heavily, and flap against
  the masts with a sad foreboding sound, whilst every heart on
  board feels more or less oppressed by the atmospheric influence,
  <a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>and every countenance
  expresses languor or discontent. But these discomforts are minor
  evils compared with other attendants upon a Newfoundland fog. It
  often happens that, in spite of every precaution on the part of
  the men on the look-out, the bows of the vessel run across some
  unfortunate fishing boat; and before a single voice can be raised
  in warning, a sudden shock, a smothered cry, a gurgling of the
  waves, tell the sad tale! One moment, and all is silent; the ship
  pursues her course, and no trace is left of the little vessel and
  her crew, for whom many days and nights will anxious love keep
  watch; but those objects of a mother's tenderness and of a wife's
  affection will never more gladden the eyes of the watchers, till
  'the sea shall give up her dead.'</p>

  <p>Would that such calamities were of less frequent occurrence.
  There is one curious characteristic of these fogs, which in some
  degree mitigates the evil of them: they sometimes do not extend
  beyond a few miles, having the appearance of a huge wall of dense
  cloud or mist. A vessel, after beating about for hours, will
  suddenly emerge from almost total darkness, the clouds break
  away, and all hearts are gladdened by finding themselves once
  more beneath the rays of the glorious sun.</p>

  <p>Captain Basil Hall gives an amusing instance of such an
  occurrence. The Cambrian 'had run in from sea towards the coast,
  enveloped in one of these dense fogs. Of course they took it for
  granted that the light-house and the adjacent land&mdash;Halifax
  included&mdash;were likewise covered with an impenetrable cloud
  of mist; but it so chanced, by what freak of Dame Nature I know
  not, that the fog on that day was confined to the deep water, so
  that we who were in the port could see it at the distance of
  several miles from the coast, lying on the ocean like a huge
  stratum of snow, with an abrupt face fronting the shore.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>'The Cambrian, lost in
  the midst of this fog-bank, supposing herself to be near land,
  fired a gun. To this the light-house replied; and so the ship and
  the light-house went on pelting away gun for gun during half the
  day, without seeing one another.</p>

  <p>'The people at the light-house had no means of communicating
  to the frigate, that if she would only stand on a little further,
  she would disentangle herself from the cloud, in which, like
  Jupiter Olympus of old, she was wasting her thunder. At last, the
  captain, hopeless of its clearing up, gave orders to pipe to
  dinner; but as the weather, in all respects except this
  abominable haze, was quite fine, and the ship was still in deep
  water, he directed her to be steered towards the shore, and the
  lead kept constantly going. As one o'clock approached, he began
  to feel uneasy, from the water shoaling, and the light-house guns
  sounding closer and closer; but being unwilling to disturb the
  men at their dinner, he resolved to stand on for the remaining
  ten minutes of the hour. Lo and behold! however, they had not
  sailed half a mile further before the flying gib-boom end emerged
  from the wall of mist, then the bowsprit shot into daylight, and
  lastly, the ship herself glided out of the cloud into the full
  blaze of a bright and 'sunshine holiday.' All hands were
  instantly turned up to make sail: and the men, as they flew on
  deck, could scarcely believe their senses when they saw behind
  them the fog-bank&mdash;right ahead the harbour's mouth, with the
  bold cliffs of Cape Sambro on the left&mdash;and further still,
  the ships at their moorings, with their ensigns and pendants
  blowing out light and dry in the breeze.'</p>

  <p>But to return to our sad tale. Towards noon, the weather
  cleared up for about a quarter of an hour, allowing just
  sufficient time to get a good observation of the latitude, which,
  according to Captain Baker's reckoning, <a name="Page_229" id=
  "Page_229"></a>made their position to be about ninety-one miles
  from Cape Race, and fifty-one from Cape St. Mary's.</p>

  <p>They continued to steer east till about six o'clock in the
  evening, when the breeze rather freshening, and the ship having
  run sixty miles since noon, she was hauled off to south-east.</p>

  <p>The fog was then so dense that the men could not see more than
  twenty yards beyond the ship, but as Captain Baker's orders were
  to use the utmost dispatch, he determined to make the best of his
  way. Every precaution was taken, by using the lead, and by
  keeping a vigilant look-out from every part of the ship. In this
  manner they proceeded, carefully feeling the way, until about
  half-past seven o'clock, when the look-out man shouted, 'Breakers
  ahead! Hard a-starboard!' The ship was instantly hauled to the
  wind, but not being able to clear the danger on that tack, every
  effort was made to stay the vessel, but from the heavy sea, and
  whilst in stays, her stern took the breakers, and she immediately
  fell broadside on, the sea breaking completely over her.</p>

  <p>At the moment the ship struck, every man was on deck, and
  there was such a universal feeling of confidence in the
  commander, that notwithstanding their extreme peril, not the
  slightest confusion ensued. Captain Baker's first order was to
  cut away the masts, so as to lighten the vessel, and perhaps
  afford means of saving some of the crew. The order was promptly
  executed, but unhappily without producing the desired result, for
  in a few moments the ship bilged, and the destruction of the
  whole crew appeared to be inevitable.</p>

  <p>Captain Baker then ordered the cutter to be launched, but they
  had scarcely got her over the gangway before she sank. It was a
  time of terrible anxiety for both officers and men; for, from the
  denseness of the fog, they could not form a conjecture as to
  their actual <a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>position,
  whilst the crashing of the masts, the strain of the vessel upon
  the rocks, and the roar of the waters, as they swept over the
  decks, added to the horrors of the scene.</p>

  <p>Captain Baker was as calm and self-possessed as if nothing
  unusual had occurred, whilst the eyes of the men were fixed upon
  him, and they were ready to obey every command with the same
  promptitude as when performing the usual routine of ship's
  duty.</p>

  <p>Fortunately a small rock was discerned through the mist, and
  as it seemed to be at no great distance, it presented a means of
  escape from the most pressing danger. Without a moment's
  hesitation, a man of the name of Lennard sprang forward, and
  seizing a lead-line, jumped into the sea; but the current setting
  directly against him to the northward, his efforts were
  unavailing, and with difficulty he was dragged on board
  again.</p>

  <p>It might be supposed that Lennard's failure would have damped
  the spirits of the men, and deterred them from a second attempt.
  But it seems to have had a contrary effect, and to have stirred
  them up to renewed exertion. A consultation was held as to the
  next steps to be taken. The only hope that remained was in the
  gig, (the jolly-boat having been washed away,) when Turner, the
  boatswain, as brave a fellow as ever breathed, volunteered to
  make the attempt. He secured a rope round his body, and was then
  lowered into the boat. The tackling was let go, the men gave a
  cheer, and the boat, with its occupant, was borne away by the
  current.</p>

  <p>With intense anxiety the men on the wreck watched the progress
  of Turner, who had been carried in the boat to within a few feet
  of the rock; then the watchers saw it balanced upon the crest of
  a huge wave, and the next moment it was dashed to pieces upon the
  rock; the boatswain, however, retained his presence of mind; he
  <a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>kept hold of the rope when
  dashed out of the boat, and succeeded in scrambling up the
  cliff.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the waves were making heavy breaches over the
  ship; the crew clung by the ropes on the forecastle; each
  succeeding wave threatened them all with destruction; when a
  tremendous sea lifted her quarter over the rock on which she had
  at first struck, and carried her close to that on which the
  boatswain stood. The forecastle, which up to this time had been
  the only sheltered part of the ship, was now abandoned for the
  poop; and as Captain Baker saw no chance of saving the vessel, he
  determined to remove the people from her if possible.</p>

  <p>Calling around him his officers and men, he communicated to
  them his intentions, and pointed out the best means of securing
  their safety. He then ordered every man to make the best of his
  way from the wreck to the rock. Now, for the first time, his
  orders were not promptly obeyed; all the crew to a man refused to
  leave the wreck unless Captain Baker would precede them. There
  was a simultaneous burst of feeling that did honour alike to the
  commander and the men. To the former, in that he had so gained
  the affection and respect of his people; and to the latter,
  inasmuch as they knew how to appreciate such an officer.</p>

  <p>Never was good discipline displayed in a more conspicuous
  manner. No argument or entreaty could prevail on Captain Baker to
  change his resolution. He again directed the men to quit the
  vessel, calmly observing that his life was the least, and last
  consideration. The men, upon hearing this reiterated command,
  stepped severally from the poop to the rock with as much order as
  if they had been leaving a ship under ordinary circumstances.
  Unhappily, a few of them perished in the attempt; amongst these
  was Lieutenant Stanley, who, being benumbed with cold, was unable
  to get a firm <a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>footing, and
  was swept away by the current, his companions, with every
  inclination, had not the power to save him; he struggled for a
  few moments&mdash;was dashed with irresistible force against the
  rocks, and the receding wave engulfed its victim.</p>

  <p>When he had seen every man clear of the wreck, and not till
  then, did Captain Baker join his crew.</p>

  <p>As soon as they had time to look about them, the ship's
  company perceived that they were on an isolated rock, separated
  from the mainland by a few fathoms. The rock rose some feet above
  the sea, but to their horror they perceived that it would be
  covered at high-water. It seemed as if they were rescued from one
  fearful catastrophe, only to perish by a more cruel and
  protracted fate. They watched the waters rise inch by inch around
  them, appalled by the feeling that those waters must sooner or
  later close over them for ever, and that nothing could save them
  except the outstretched arm of Him who could bid the waves be
  stayed, and say to the stormy winds, be still. Every man is more
  or less courageous under circumstances of danger, when it is
  attended by excitement,&mdash;such as that of the battlefield.
  There is a courage which springs from companionship in danger,
  and a courage derived from the fear of shame; but the test of
  true valour is a scene like that we have described. <i>There</i>
  was no room for a display of the adventitious bravery which often
  becomes in reality the thing it strives to appear. No man
  <i>there</i> could reproach his neighbour if his cheek should
  blanch and his lip quiver; all are alike appalled, but the
  well-regulated mind rises superior to the rest. Such was the case
  with Captain Baker. Although he could not conceal from himself
  that their condition was almost hopeless, he continued with his
  voice to encourage the timid, and by his arm to support the
  weak.</p>

  <p>By degrees the fog had partially dispersed, and as the
  <a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>dawn began to break, a
  dreary prospect was displayed. The haggard countenances and
  lacerated limbs of the men told the sufferings they had endured,
  whilst the breakers, which they had only heard before, became
  distinctly visible. Still the devoted crew, following the example
  of their commander, uttered no complaint. They were ready to meet
  death, yet they felt it hard to die without a struggle. The tide
  was rising rapidly, and if anything was to be done, it must be
  done instantly. The boatswain, who had never lost hold of the
  rope, determined at all hazards to make another effort to save
  his comrades, or to perish in the attempt.</p>

  <p>Having caused one end of the rope to be made fast round his
  body, and committing himself to the protection of the Almighty,
  he plunged into the sea, and struck out in the direction of the
  opposite shore.</p>

  <p>It was an awful moment to those who were left behind; and in
  breathless suspense they waited the result of the daring attempt.
  All depended upon the strength of his arm. At one moment he was
  seen rising on the crest of the wave, at the next he disappeared
  in the trough of the sea; but in spite of the raging surf, and of
  every other obstacle, he reached the shore, and an inspiring
  cheer announced his safety to his comrades.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had recovered his breath and strength, he went
  to the nearest point opposite the rock, and, watching his
  opportunity, he cast one end of the line across to his
  companions. Fortunately it reached the rock, and was gladly
  seized, but it proved to be only long enough to allow of one man
  holding it on the shore, and another on the rock, at arm's
  length. It may be imagined with what joy this slender means of
  deliverance was welcomed by all. The tide had made rapid
  advances; the waves, as if impatient for their prey, threw the
  white surf aloft, and dashed over the rock.</p>

  <p>Would that we could do justice to the noble courage <a name=
  "Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>and conduct displayed by the crew of
  the Drake. Instead of rushing to the rope, as many would have
  done under similar circumstances, not a man moved until he was
  commanded to do so by Captain Baker. Had the slightest hesitation
  appeared on the part of the commander, or any want of presence of
  mind in the men, a tumultuous rush would have ensued, the rope,
  held as it was with difficulty by the outstretched hand, would
  inevitably have been lost in the struggle, and then all would
  have perished.</p>

  <p>But good order, good discipline, and good feeling triumphed
  over every selfish fear and natural instinct of
  self-preservation, and to the honour of British sailors be it
  recorded, that each individual man of the crew, before he availed
  himself of the means of rescue, urged his captain to provide for
  his own safety first, by leading the way. But Captain Baker
  turned a deaf ear to every persuasion, and gave but one answer to
  all&mdash;'I will never leave the rock until every soul is
  safe.'</p>

  <p>In vain the men redoubled their entreaties that he would go;
  they were of no avail; the intrepid officer was steadfast in his
  purpose. There was no time for further discussion or delay. One
  by one the men slipped from the rock upon the rope, and by this
  assistance forty-four out of fifty succeeded in gaining the
  opposite shore. Unfortunately, amongst the six who remained, one
  was a woman. This poor creature, completely prostrate from the
  sufferings she had endured, lay stretched upon the cold rock
  almost lifeless. To desert her was impossible; to convey her to
  the shore seemed equally impossible. Each moment of delay was
  fraught with destruction. A brave fellow, in the generosity of
  despair, when his turn came to quit the rock, took the woman in
  his arms, grasped the rope, and began the perilous transit. Alas!
  he was not permitted to gain the desired shore. When he had made
  about half the distance, the rope parted&mdash;<a name="Page_235" id=
  "Page_235"></a>not being strong enough to sustain the additional
  weight and strain, it broke; the seaman and his burden were seen
  but for an instant, and then swallowed up in the foaming eddies.
  With them perished the last means of preservation that remained
  for Captain Baker and those who were with him on the rock. Their
  communication with the mainland was cut off; the water rose, and
  the surf increased every moment; all hope was gone, and for them
  a few minutes more must end 'life's long voyage.'</p>

  <p>The men on shore tried every means in their power to save
  them. They tied every handkerchief and available material
  together to replace the lost rope, but their efforts were
  fruitless; they could not get length enough to reach the rock. A
  party was despatched in search of help. They found a farm-house;
  and while they were in search of a rope, those who stayed to
  watch the fate of their loved and respected commander and his
  three companions, saw wave after wave rise higher and higher. At
  one moment the sufferers disappeared in the foam and spray; the
  bravest shuddered, and closed his eyes on the scene. Again, as
  spell-bound, he looked; the wave had receded&mdash;they still
  lived, and rose above the waters. Again and again it was thus;
  but hope grew fainter and fainter. We can scarcely bring our
  narrative to an end; tears moisten our page; but the painful
  sequel must be told. The fatal billow came at last which bore
  them from time into eternity&mdash;all was over. When the party
  returned from their inland search, not a vestige of the rock, or
  of those devoted men, was to be seen.</p>

  <p>We feel how inadequate have been our efforts to depict the
  self-devotion of Captain Baker, and the <a name="Page_236" id=
  "Page_236"></a>courage and constancy of his crew. The following
  letter, addressed to Lieutenant Booth, formerly an officer of the
  Drake, will go farther than any panegyric we can offer, to
  display the right feeling of the ship's company, and their just
  appreciation of their brave and faithful commander.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>'SIR,&mdash;Your being an old officer of ours in a former
    ship, and being our first lieutenant in H.M. ship Drake, leads
    us to beg that you will have the goodness to represent to our
    Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the very high sense of
    gratitude we, the surviving petty officers and crew of his
    Majesty's late ship Drake, feel due to the memory of our late
    much lamented, and most worthy commander, who, at the moment he
    saw death staring him in the face on one side, and the
    certainty of escape was pointed out to him on the other, most
    stanchly and frequently refused to attempt procuring his own
    safety, until every man and boy had been rescued from the
    impending danger. Indeed, the manliness and fortitude displayed
    by the late Captain Baker on the melancholy occasion of our
    wreck was such as never before was heard of. It was not as that
    of a moment, but his courage was tried for many hours, and his
    last determination of not crossing from the rock, on which he
    was every moment in danger of being washed away, was made with
    more firmness, if possible, than the first. In fact, during the
    whole business he proved himself to be a man whose name and
    last conduct ought ever to be held in the highest estimation by
    a crew who feel it their duty to ask from the Lords
    Commissioners of the Admiralty that, which they otherwise have
    not the means of obtaining, that is, a public and lasting
    record of the lion-hearted, generous, and very unexampled way
    in which our late noble commander sacrificed his life in the
    evening of the 23rd of June.'</p>
  </div>

  monument erected to the memory of Captain Baker, in the chapel of
  the Royal Dockyard at Portsmouth.</p>

  <h2><a name="FURY" id="FURY"></a>FURY.</h2>

  <p>In the year 1824, notwithstanding the repeated failures which
  had attended the expeditions to the Polar Seas, the British
  government determined to make another attempt to discover a
  passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; for this purpose
  Captain, now Sir Edward Parry was appointed to the command of the
  Hecla, and a second vessel was commissioned by Captain Hoppner,
  who was directed to put himself under the orders of the
  beforenamed officer.</p>

  <p>The vessels being fully equipped and furnished with provisions
  and stores for two years, sailed from England on the 16th of May.
  Their progress had been unexpectedly slow, from the quantity and
  magnitude of the ice, which had kept the people constantly
  employed in heaving, warping, or sawing through it, so that they
  did not arrive at the entrance of Lancaster Sound until nearly
  the middle of September.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the more than ordinary difficulties
  which they encountered in crossing the barrier of ice in Baffin's
  Bay was owing to a season of very unusual severity; indeed,
  Captain Parry was of opinion, that but for Phillips's capstan,
  the Hecla and Fury would have been obliged to winter in the
  middle of Baffin's Bay.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>The season was now too
  far advanced to give any hopes of the ships being able to
  penetrate to the westward, according to their instructions,
  during the present year; Captain Parry determined, therefore, to
  push on as far as the present season would permit, and devote the
  whole of the next summer to the fulfilment of the object of the
  expedition.</p>

  <p>It is not our intention to enter into a detailed description
  of the many difficulties which they met in their passage; it is
  enough to say that their toils were incessant, and nothing but
  the most unwearied vigilance and perseverance could have
  prevented the ships being materially damaged by the enormous
  pressure of the ice.</p>

  <p>Both officers and men were constantly employed, one time in
  getting out the boats to tow or cut through the ice, at another,
  at what is termed 'sallying,' or causing the ship to roll, by the
  men running in a body from side to side, so as to relieve her
  from the adhesion and friction of the young ice. It sometimes
  happened, also, that their labour was in vain; for during the
  night a westerly wind would spring up, and that, combined with a
  strong current, would drive the vessels several leagues to
  eastward, thus compelling them to recommence their work over
  again.</p>

  <p>On the 27th of September they found themselves in a tolerably
  open sea, and assisted by a fine working breeze they reached Port
  Bowen, in Regent's Inlet. Here Captain Parry determined to make
  his winter harbour, being convinced that it would be safer to
  remain there, than run the risk of any further attempt at
  navigation during the present year.</p>

  <p>'To those who read,' writes Sir Edward Parry, 'as well as
  those who describe, the account of a winter passed in these
  regions can no longer be expected to afford the interest of
  novelty it once possessed; more especially in <a name="Page_242"
  id="Page_242"></a>a station already delineated with tolerable
  geographical precision on our maps, and thus, as it were, brought
  near to our firesides at home.'</p>

  <p>Here it may be perhaps asked, why tell a thrice-told
  tale?&mdash;why go over ground that has been so often trod
  before? The answer is, we are not only writing for the
  information of the general reader, but also for the seaman, in
  the hope that these examples may afford encouragement to him, if
  ever thrown under similar circumstances to those which befel the
  crews of the Hecla and Fury.</p>

  <p>In a short time, the ships became embedded in ice, and in this
  remote part of the globe were they destined to remain, in all
  probability, for nine months, during the greater part of which
  they would not see the light of the sun.</p>

  <p>To the seaman, whose happiness is dependent upon a life of
  excitement and adventure, such a change must be almost
  insupportable. As far as the eye could reach, nothing was to be
  seen but trackless wilds of snow; an awful stillness reigned
  around; even the indigenous animals had for a time fled; and out
  of his ship, which is the world to him, not a living creature
  breathed in this dreary desert. In order to procure occupation
  and amusement for the men, it was necessary to hit upon some
  expedient to keep their spirits from flagging. This was found, by
  a proposal from Captain Hoppner, that they should attempt a
  masquerade, in which both officers and men should join. The happy
  thought was at once seized upon, the ship's tailor was placed in
  requisition, admirably dressed characters were enacted, and mirth
  and merriment rang through the decks of the Hecla. These
  r&eacute;unions took place once a month, alternately on board
  each ship, and not one instance is related of anything occurring
  which could interfere with the regular discipline of the ship, or
  at all weaken the respect of the men towards their superiors. But
  an occupation which <a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>was of
  benefit as much to the mind as to the body, was found in the
  establishment of a school on board each of the ships. These were
  superintended by Mr. Hooper, in the Hecla, and Mr. Mogg, in the
  Fury. The men gladly seized this opportunity of instruction which
  was afforded them, and in many a long winter evening the lower
  deck was made a scene of rational employment, which was not only
  a lasting benefit to themselves, but assisted materially in
  passing away the time, which otherwise would have hung heavily on
  their hands.</p>

  <p>We cannot refrain here from offering a few observations upon
  the good results of education to the seaman.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of the present century, and even in a much
  later date, the majority of our seamen could neither read nor
  write; in the present day it is quite the reverse. We may affirm,
  without exaggeration, that two-thirds of them are more or less
  educated. Experience has taught those placed at the head of naval
  affairs the advantages arising from the improvement of the minds
  of the seamen of our navy; every ship has now a seaman
  schoolmaster, and a well selected library; and there is no doubt
  that the moral effect thus produced, adds in no small degree to
  the preservation of that discipline which is so necessary for the
  comfort and welfare of a ship's company.</p>

  <p>In corroboration of the above, we cannot do better than quote
  the words of Sir Edward Parry:&mdash;'And I do not speak lightly
  when I express my thorough persuasion that to the moral effect
  thus produced upon the minds of the men were owing to a very high
  degree the constant yet sober cheerfulness, the uninterrupted
  good order, and even in some measure the extraordinary state of
  health which prevailed among us during winter.'</p>

  <p>With the amusement before mentioned, varied now and then, as
  the days grew longer, by the excitement of <a name="Page_244" id=
  "Page_244"></a>killing a bear, entrapping foxes, or shooting
  grouse, the men continued to pass the winter months. To the
  officers, higher and more intellectual enjoyments were afforded
  by making observations, studying astronomy, and witnessing the
  brilliant appearance of the Aurora Borealis.</p>

  <p>About the end of March, or beginning of April, 1825, thin
  flakes of snow, lying upon painted wood or metal, exposed to the
  sun's direct rays, began to melt. These signs of returning spring
  were hailed as indications of their approaching deliverance from
  their winter quarters. Towards the middle of June, information
  was brought that the sea was clear of ice about twenty miles from
  Port Bowen. On the 12th of July, the ice began to break away,
  leaving the ship about one mile and a quarter from the open sea.
  All hands were set to work to saw through this barrier, the men
  being employed from seven in the morning, till seven in the
  evening. On the 19th, after the most incessant labour, which was
  performed with the greatest cheerfulness and alacrity, Captain
  Parry had the satisfaction of seeing the two vessels once more
  floating in their proper element.</p>

  <p>After a winter of unusual severity, but of unprecedented good
  health, they sailed out of Port Bowen on the 20th of July, the
  expedition being in every respect in the most perfect condition,
  and the season remarkably forward and fine. Pushing over to the
  west coast of Prince Regent's Inlet, which it was Captain Parry's
  intention to coast northward and then westward, till they could
  strike off to the continental shore, the prospect seemed as
  favourable as could possibly be expected. The season continued
  unusually warm, and channels of open water always occurred along
  the shore with particular winds. The ice was entirely detached
  from the shores, very much broken up, and lighter than they had
  yet navigated.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>Proceeding as usual,
  taking advantage of every opening, and sheltering the ships on
  shore when the ice closed, the Fury, on the 1st of August, was
  unfortunately pressed by the ice in such a manner, while she also
  took the ground, that her main keel, stern-post, and cutwater
  were immediately broken, and four pumps were necessary to keep
  her free.</p>

  <p>It was now evidently impossible to proceed without heaving the
  Fury down to repair, her officers and men being in a few days
  almost exhausted with excessive fatigue; the men's hands having
  become so sore from the constant friction of the ropes, that they
  could hardly handle them any longer without the use of
  mittens.</p>

  <p>The shore being a straight and exposed one, the principal
  difficulty consisted in securing the ship from the inroads of the
  ice during the operation. There was little hopes of discovering a
  harbour for this purpose, and the only alternative was to
  endeavour to make one. This was done by passing lower cables
  round grounded masses of ice, and setting them up to anchors
  buried on the beach, so as to form a basin for the reception of
  the ships.</p>

  <p>We have now arrived at the period when the labour of heaving
  down the Fury commenced; and, for the better information of the
  reader, we will at once lay before him the account of the future
  proceedings, as related by Sir Edward Parry.<a name=
  "FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

  <p>'The ice remaining quite close, on the 6th every individual in
  both ships, with the exception of those at the pumps, was
  employed in landing provisions from the Fury, together with the
  spars, boats, and everything from <a name="Page_246" id=
  "Page_246"></a>off her upper deck. The ice coming in in the
  afternoon with a degree of pressure which usually attended a
  northerly wind on this coast, twisted the Fury's rudder so
  forcibly against a mass of ice lying under her stern, that it was
  for some hours in great danger of being damaged, and was, indeed,
  only saved by the efforts of Captain Hoppner and his officers,
  who, without breaking off the men from their other occupations,
  themselves worked at the ice-saw.</p>

  <p>'On the following day, the ice remaining as before, the work
  was continued without intermission, and a great quantity of
  things landed. The two carpenters, Messrs. Pulfer and Fiddis,
  took the Fury's boats in hand themselves, their men being
  required as part of our physical strength in clearing the ship.
  The armourer was also set to work on the beach in forging bolts
  for the martingales of the outriggers. In short, every living
  creature among us was somehow or other employed, not even
  excepting our dogs, which were set to drag up the stores on the
  beach, so that our little dockyard soon exhibited the most
  animated scene imaginable. The quickest method of landing casks,
  and other things not too weighty, was that adopted by Captain
  Hoppner, and consisted of a hawser secured to the ship's mainmast
  head, and set up as tight as possible to the anchor on the
  beach,&mdash;the casks being hooked to a block traversing on this
  as a jack stay, were made to run down with great velocity. By
  this means, more than two were got on shore for every one handed
  by the boats; the latter, however, being constantly employed in
  addition. The Fury was thus so much lightened in the course of
  the day, that two pumps were now nearly sufficient to keep her
  free, and this number continued requisite until she was hove
  down. Her spirit room was now entirely clear, and on examination
  the water was found to be rushing <a name="Page_247" id=
  "Page_247"></a>in through two or three holes that happened to be
  in the ceiling, and which were immediately plugged up. Indeed it
  was now very evident that nothing but the lightness of the Fury's
  diagonal ceiling had so long kept her afloat, and that any ship
  not thus fortified within could not possibly have been kept free
  by the pumps.</p>

  <p>'At night, just as the people were going to rest, the ice
  began to move to the southward, and soon after came in towards
  the shore, again endangering the Fury's rudder, and pressing her
  over on her side to so alarming a degree, as to warn us that it
  would not be safe to lighten her much more in her present
  insecure situation.</p>

  <p>'One of our bergs also shifted its position by this pressure,
  so as to weaken our confidence in the pier heads of our intended
  basin; and a long 'tongue' of one of them, forcing itself under
  the Hecla's fore-foot, while the drift-ice was also pressing her
  forcibly from astern, she once more sewed three or four feet
  forward at low water, and continued to do so, notwithstanding
  repeated endeavours to haul her off, for four successive tides,
  the ice remaining so close, and so much doubled under the ship,
  as to render it impossible to move her a single inch.</p>

  <p>'Notwithstanding the state of the ice, however, we did not
  remain idle on the 8th, all hands being employed in unrigging the
  Fury, and landing all her spars, sails, booms, boats, and other
  top weight.</p>

  <p>'The ice still continuing very close on the 9th, all hands
  were employed in attempting, by saws and axes, to clear the
  Hecla, which still grounded on the tongue of ice every tide.
  After four hours' labour, they succeeded in making four or five
  feet of room astern, when the ship suddenly slided down off the
  tongue with considerable force, and became once more afloat. We
  then got on shore the Hecla's cables and hawsers for the
  accommodation of the Fury's men in our tiers during the heaving
  <a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>down; struck our topmasts,
  which would be required as shores and outriggers; and, in short,
  continued to occupy every individual in some preparation or
  other.</p>

  <p>'These being entirely completed at an early hour in the
  afternoon, we ventured to go on with the landing of the coals and
  provisions from the Fury, preferring to run the risk which would
  thus be incurred, to the loss of even a few hours in the
  accomplishment of our present object. As it very opportunely
  happened, however, the external ice slackened to the distance of
  about a hundred yards outside of us, on the morning of the 10th,
  enabling us by a most tedious and laborious operation, to clear
  the ice out of our basin piece by piece. The difficulty of this
  apparently simple process consisted in the heavy pressure having
  repeatedly doubled one mass under another, a position in which it
  requires great power to move them, and also by the corners
  locking in with the sides of the bergs.</p>

  <p>'Our next business was to tighten the cables sufficiently by
  means of purchases, and to finish the floating of them in the
  manner and for the purpose before described. After this had been
  completed, the ships had only a few feet in length, and nothing
  in breadth to spare, but we had now great hopes of going on with
  our work with increased confidence and security. The Fury, which
  was placed inside, had something less than eighteen feet at low
  water; the Hecla lay in four fathoms, the bottom being strewed
  with large and small fragments of limestone.</p>

  <p>'While thus employed in securing the ships, the smoothness of
  the water enabled us to see, in some degree, the nature of the
  Fury's damage; and it may be conceived how much pain it
  occasioned us, plainly to discover that both the stern-post and
  fore-foot were broken and turned up on one side with the
  pressure. <a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>We could also
  perceive, as far as we were able to see along the main-keel, that
  it was much torn, and we had therefore reason to conclude that
  the damage would altogether prove very serious. We also
  discovered that several feet of the Hecla's false keel were torn
  away abreast of the fore chains, in consequence of her grounding
  forward so frequently.</p>

  <p>'The ships being now as well secured as our means permitted
  from the immediate danger of ice, the clearing of the Fury went
  on with increased confidence, though greater alacrity was
  impossible, for nothing could exceed the spirit and zealous
  activity of every individual, and as things had turned out, the
  ice had not obliged us to wait a moment except at the actual
  times of its pressure. Being favoured with fine weather, we
  continued our work very quickly, so that on the 12th every cask
  was landed, and also the powder; and the spare sails and clothing
  put on board the Hecla.</p>

  <p>'On the 13th, we found that a mass of heavy ice which had been
  aground with the Fury, had now floated alongside of her at high
  water, still further contracting her already narrow basin, and
  leaving the ship no room for turning round. At the next high
  water, therefore, we got a purchase on it, and hove it out of the
  way, so that at night it drifted off altogether.</p>

  <p>'The coals and preserved meats were the principal things now
  remaining on board the Fury, and these we continued landing by
  every method we could devise as the most expeditious. The tide
  rose so considerably at night, new moon occurring within an hour
  of high water, that we were much afraid of our bergs floating;
  they remained firm, however, even though the ice came in with so
  much force as to break one of our hand-masts, a fir spar of
  twelve inches in diameter. As the high tides, and the lightening
  of the Fury, now gave us suf<a name="Page_250" id=
  "Page_250"></a>ficient depth of water for unshipping the rudders,
  we did so, and laid them upon the small berg astern of us, for
  fear of their being damaged by any pressure of the ice.</p>

  <p>'Early on the morning of the 14th, the ice slackening a little
  in our neighbourhood, we took advantage of it, though the people
  were much fagged, to tighten the cables, which had stretched and
  yielded considerably by the late pressure. It was well that we
  did so, for in the course of this day we were several times
  interrupted in our work by the ice coming with a tremendous
  strain on the north cables, the wind blowing strong from the
  N.N.W., and the whole 'pack' outside of us setting rapidly to the
  southward. Indeed, notwithstanding the recent tightening and
  re-adjustment of the cables, the bight was pressed in so much, as
  to force the Fury against the berg astern of her, twice in the
  course of the day. Mr. Waller, who was in the hold the second
  time that this occurred, reported that the coals about the
  keelson were moved by it, imparting the sensation of part of the
  ship's bottom falling down; and one of the men at work there was
  so strongly impressed with that belief, that he thought it high
  time to make a spring for the hatchway. From this circumstance,
  it seemed more probable that the main keel had received some
  serious damage near the middle of the ship.</p>

  <p>'From this trial of the efficacy of our means of security, it
  was plain that the Fury could not possibly be hove down under
  circumstances of such frequent and imminent risk. I therefore
  directed a fourth anchor, with two additional cables, to be
  disposed, with the hope of breaking some of the force of the ice,
  by its offering a more oblique resistance than the other, and
  thus by degrees turning the direction of the pressure from the
  ships. We had scarcely completed this new defence, when the
  largest floe we had <a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>seen
  since leaving Port Bowen came sweeping along the shore, having a
  motion to the southward of not less than a mile and a half an
  hour, threatened to overturn it, and would certainly have
  dislodged it from its situation but from the cable recently
  attached to it.</p>

  <p>'A second similar occurrence took place with a smaller mass of
  ice about midnight, and near the top of an unusually high spring
  tide, which seemed ready to float away every security from us.
  For three hours about the time of this high water, our situation
  was a most critical one, for had the bergs, or, indeed, any one
  of them, been carried away or broken, both ships must inevitably
  have been driven on shore by the very next mass of ice that
  should come in. Happily, however, they did not suffer any further
  material disturbance, and the main body keeping at a short
  distance from the land until the tide had fallen, the bergs
  seemed to be once more firmly resting on the ground. The only
  mischief, therefore, occasioned by this disturbance was the
  slackening of our cables by the alteration in the position of the
  several grounded masses, and the consequent necessity of
  employing more time, which nothing but absolute necessity could
  induce us to bestow, in adjusting and tightening the whole of
  them afresh.</p>

  <p>'The wind veering to the W.N.W. on the morning of the 15th,
  and still continuing to blow strong, the ice was forced three or
  four miles off the land in the course of a few hours, leaving us
  a quiet day for continuing our work, but exciting no very
  pleasant sensations, when we considered what progress we might
  have been making had we been at liberty to pursue our object.</p>

  <p>'The land was indeed so clear of ice to the southward, that
  Dr. Neill, who walked a considerable distance in that direction,
  could see nothing but an open channel in shore to the utmost
  extent of his view. We took <a name="Page_252" id=
  "Page_252"></a>advantage of this open water to send the launch
  for the Fury's ironwork, left at the former station; for though
  the few men thus employed could very ill be spared, we were
  obliged to arrange everything with reference to the ultimate
  saving of time; and it would have occupied both ships' companies
  more than a whole day to carry the things round by land.</p>

  <p>'The Fury being completely cleared at an early hour on the
  16th, we were all busily employed in 'winding' the ship, and in
  preparing the outriggers, shores, purchases, and additional
  rigging. Though we purposely selected the time of high water for
  turning the ship round, we had scarcely a foot of space for doing
  it, and indeed, as it was, her fore-foot touched the ground; and
  loosened the broken part of the wood so much as to enable us to
  pull it up with ropes, when we found the fragments to consist of
  the whole of the gripe, and most of the 'cutwater.' The strong
  breeze continuing, and the sea rising as the open water increased
  in extent, our bergs were sadly washed and wasted; every hour
  producing a sensible and serious diminution in their bulk. As,
  however, the main body of ice still kept off, we were in hopes,
  now that our preparations were so near completed, we should have
  been enabled in a few hours to see the extent of the damage, and
  repair it sufficiently to allow us to proceed.</p>

  <p>'In the evening we received the Fury's crew on board the
  Hecla, every arrangement and regulation having been previously
  made for their personal comfort, and for the preservation of
  cleanliness, ventilation, and dry warmth throughout the ship. The
  officers of the Fury, by their own choice, pitched a tent on
  shore for messing and sleeping in, as our accommodation for two
  sets of officers was necessarily confined. On the 17th, when
  every preparation was completed, the cables were found <a name=
  "Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>again so slack, by the wasting of
  the bergs, in consequence of the continued sea, and possibly also
  in part by the masses being moved somewhat in shore, that we were
  obliged to occupy several hours in putting them to rights, as we
  should soon require all our strength at the purchases. One berg
  also had, at the last low water, fallen over on its side, in
  consequence of its substance being undermined by the sea, and the
  cable surrounding it was thus forced so low under water as no
  longer to afford protection from the ice should it again come in.
  In tightening the cables, we found it to have the effect of
  bringing the bergs in towards the shore, still further
  contracting our narrow basin; but anything was better than
  suffering them to go adrift.</p>

  <p>'This work being finished at ten P.M., the people were allowed
  three hours' rest only, it being necessary to heave the ship down
  at, or near, high water, as there was not sufficient depth to
  allow her to take her distance at any other time of tide. Every
  preparation being made, at three A.M., on the 18th, we began to
  heave her down on the larboard side; but when the purchases were
  nearly a-block, we found that the strops under the Hecla's
  bottom, as well as some of the Fury's shore-fasts, had stretched
  or yielded so much, that they could bring the keel out of water
  within three or four feet. We immediately eased her up again, and
  re-adjusted everything as requisite, hauling her further in shore
  than before by keeping a considerable keel upon her, so as to
  make less depth of water necessary; and we were then in the act
  of once more heaving her down, when a snow storm came on, and
  blew with such violence off the land, as to raise a considerable
  sea. The ships had now so much motion as to strain the gear very
  much, and even to make the lower mast of the Fury bend in spite
  of the shores. We were, therefore, most unwillingly compelled
  <a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>to desist until the sea
  should go down, keeping everything ready to recommence the
  instant we could possibly do so with safety. The officers and men
  were now literally so harassed and fatigued as to be scarcely
  capable of further exertion without some rest; and on this and
  one or two other occasions, I noticed more than a single instance
  of stupor amounting to a certain degree of failure in intellect,
  rendering the individual so affected quite unable at first to
  comprehend the meaning of an order, though still as willing as
  ever to obey it. It was, therefore, perhaps, a fortunate
  necessity which produced the intermission of labour which the
  strength of every individual seemed to require.</p>

  <p>'The gale rather increasing than otherwise, during the whole
  day and night of the 18th, had, on the following morning, when
  the wind and sea still continued unabated, so destroyed the bergs
  on which our sole dependence was placed, that they no longer
  remained aground at low water; the cables had again become slack
  about them, and the basin we had taken so much pains in forming
  had now lost all its defences, at least during a portion of every
  tide. It will be plain, too, if I have succeeded in giving a
  distinct description of our situation, that independently of the
  security of the ships, there was now nothing left to seaward by
  which the Hecla could be held out in that direction while heaving
  the Fury down, so that our preparations in this way were no
  longer available.</p>

  <p>'After a night of most anxious consideration and consultation
  with Captain Hoppner, who was now my mess-mate in the Hecla, it
  appeared but too plain that, should the ice again come in,
  neither ship could any longer be secured from driving on shore.
  It was therefore determined instantly to prepare the Hecla for
  sea, making her thoroughly effective in every respect; so that we
  <a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>might at least push her out
  into comparative safety among the ice, when it closed again,
  taking every person on board her; securing the Fury in the best
  manner we could, and returning to her the instant we were able to
  do so, to endeavour to get her out, and to carry her to some
  place of security for heaving down. If, after the Hecla was
  ready, time should still be allowed us, it was proposed
  immediately to put into the Fury all that was requisite, or at
  least as much as she could safely carry, and towing her out into
  the ice, to try the effect of 'foldering' the leaks, by sails
  under those parts of her keel which we knew to be damaged, until
  some more effectual means could be resorted to.</p>

  <p>'Having communicated to the assembled officers and ships'
  companies my views and intentions, and moreover given them to
  understand that I hoped to see the Hecla's top-gallant yards
  across before we slept, we commenced our work, and such was the
  hearty good-will and indefatigable energy with which it was
  carried on, that by midnight the whole was accomplished, and a
  bower-anchor and cable carried out in the offing, for the double
  purpose of hauling out the Hecla when requisite, and as some
  security to the Fury if we were obliged to leave her. The people
  were once more quite exhausted by these exertions, especially
  those belonging to the Fury, who had never thoroughly recovered
  their first fatigues. The ice being barely in sight, we were
  enabled to enjoy seven hours of undisturbed rest; but the wind
  becoming light, and afterwards shifting to the N.N.E., we had
  reason to expect the ice would soon close the shore, and were,
  therefore, most anxious to continue our work.</p>

  <p>'On the 20th, therefore, the re-loading of the Fury commenced
  with recruited strength and spirits, such articles being in the
  first place selected for putting on board as were essentially
  requisite for her re-equipment; <a name="Page_256" id=
  "Page_256"></a>for it was my full determination, could we succeed
  in completing this, not to wait even for rigging a topmast, or
  getting a lower yard up, in the event of the ice coming in, but
  to tow her out among the ice, and there put everything
  sufficiently to rights for carrying her to someplace of security.
  At the same time, the end of the sea-cable was taken on board the
  Fury, by way of offering some resistance to the ice, which was
  now more plainly seen, though still about five miles distant. A
  few hands were also spared, consisting chiefly of two or three
  convalescents and some of the officers, to thrum a sail for
  putting under the Fury's keel; for we were very anxious to
  relieve the men at the pumps, which constantly required the
  labour of eight to twelve hands to keep her free. In the course
  of the day several heavy masses of ice came drifting by with a
  breeze from the north-east, which is here about two points upon
  the land, and made a considerable swell. One mass came in contact
  with our bergs, which, though only held by the cables, brought it
  up in time to prevent mischief. By a long and hard day's labour,
  the people not going to rest till two o'clock on the morning of
  the 21st, we got about fifty tons weight of coals and provisions
  on board the Fury, which, in case of necessity, we considered
  sufficient to give her stability.</p>

  <p>'While we were thus employed, the ice, though evidently
  inclined to come in, did not approach us much; and it may be
  conceived with what anxiety we longed to be allowed one more
  day's labour, on which the ultimate saving of the ship might
  almost be considered as depending. Having hauled the ships out a
  little from the shore, and prepared the Hecla for casting by a
  spring at a moment's notice, all the people except those at the
  pumps were sent to rest, which, however, they had not enjoyed for
  two hours, when, at four A.M. <a name="Page_257" id=
  "Page_257"></a>on the 21st, another heavy mass coming violently
  in contact with the bergs and cables, threatened to sweep away
  every remaining security. Our situation, with this additional
  strain,&mdash;the mass which had disturbed us fixing itself upon
  the weather-cable, and an increasing wind and swell setting
  considerably on the shore,&mdash;became more and more precarious;
  and indeed, under circumstances as critical as can well be
  imagined, nothing but the urgency and importance of the object we
  had in view&mdash;that of saving the Fury, if she was to be
  saved&mdash;could have prevented my making sail, and keeping the
  Hecla under way till matters mended. More hawsers were run out,
  however, and enabled us still to hold out: and after six hours of
  disturbed rest, all hands were again set to work to get the
  Fury's anchors, cables, rudder, and spars on board, these things
  being absolutely necessary for her equipment, should we be able
  to get her out. At two P.M. the crews were called on board to
  dinner, which they had not finished, when several not very large
  masses of ice drove along the shore near us at a quick rate, and
  two or three successively coming in violent contact either with
  the Hecla or the bergs to which she was attached, convinced me
  that very little additional pressure would tear everything away,
  and drive both ships on shore. I saw that the moment had arrived
  when the Hecla could no longer be kept in her present situation
  with the smallest chance of safety, and therefore immediately got
  under sail, despatching Captain Hoppner, with every individual,
  except a few for working the ship, to continue getting the things
  on board the Fury, while the Hecla stood off and on. It was a
  quarter-past three P.M. when we cast off, the wind then blowing
  fresh from the north-east, or about two points on the land, which
  caused some surf on the beach. Captain Hoppner had scarcely been
  an hour on board <a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>the Fury,
  and was busily engaged in getting the anchors and cables on
  board, when we observed some large pieces of not very heavy ice
  closing in with the land near her; and at twenty minutes after
  the Hecla had cast off, I was informed, by signal, that the Fury
  was on shore. Making a tack in shore, but not being able, even
  under a press of canvass, to get very near her, owing to a strong
  southerly current which prevailed within a mile or two of the
  land, I perceived that she had been apparently driven up the
  beach by two or three of the grounded masses forcing her onwards
  before them, and these, as well as the ship, seemed now so firmly
  aground, as entirely to block her in on the seaward side. We also
  observed that the bergs outside of her had been torn away, and
  set adrift by the ice. As the navigating of the Hecla with only
  ten men on board required constant attention and care, I could
  not at this time with propriety leave the ship to go on board the
  Fury. This, however, I the less regretted, as Captain Hoppner was
  thoroughly acquainted with all my views and intentions, and I
  felt confident that, under his direction, nothing would be left
  undone to endeavour to save the ship. I, therefore, directed him
  by telegraph, 'if he thought nothing could be done at present, to
  return on board with all hands until the wind changed;' for this
  alone, as far as I could see the state of the Fury, seemed to
  offer the smallest chance of clearing the shore, so as to enable
  us to proceed with our work, or to attempt hauling the ship off
  the ground.</p>

  <p>'About seven P.M., Captain Hoppner returned to the Hecla,
  accompanied by all hands, except an officer with a party at the
  pumps, reporting to me that the Fury had been forced aground by
  the ice pressing on the masses lying near her, and bringing home,
  if not breaking, the seaward anchor, so that the ship was soon
  found <a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>to have swerved from
  two to three feet fore and aft. The several masses of ice had,
  moreover, so disposed themselves, as almost to surround her on
  every side where there was sufficient depth of water for hauling
  her off. With the ship thus situated, and masses of heavy ice
  constantly coming in, it was Captain Hoppner's decided opinion,
  as well as that of Lieutenants Austin and Ross, that to have laid
  out another anchor to seaward would have only been to expose it
  to the same danger as there was reason to suppose had been
  incurred with the other, without the most distant hope of doing
  any service, especially as the ship had been driven on shore by a
  most unfortunate coincidence, just as the tide was beginning to
  fall. Indeed, in the present state of the Fury, nothing short of
  chopping and sawing up a part of the ice under her stern could by
  any possibility have effected her release, even if she had been
  already afloat. Under such circumstances, hopeless as, for the
  time, every seaman will allow them to have been, Captain Hoppner
  judiciously determined to return for the present, as directed by
  my telegraphic communication; but being anxious to keep the ship
  free from water as long as possible, he left an officer and a
  small party of men to continue working at the pumps, so long as a
  communication could be kept up between the Hecla and the shore.
  Every moment, however, decreased the practicability of doing
  this; and finding, soon after Captain Hoppner's return, that the
  current swept the Hecla a long way to the southward while
  hoisting up the boats, and that more ice was drifting in towards
  the shore, I was under the painful necessity of recalling the
  party at the pumps, rather than incur the risk, now an inevitable
  one, of parting company with them altogether. Accordingly Mr.
  Bird, with the last of the people, came on board at eight o'clock
  in the evening, having left eighteen inches <a name="Page_260"
  id="Page_260"></a>water in the well, and four pumps being
  requisite to keep her free. In three hours after Mr. Bird's
  return, more than half a mile of closely packed ice intervened
  between the Fury and the open water in which we were beating, and
  before the morning this barrier had increased to four or five
  miles in breadth.</p>

  <p>'We carried a press of canvas all night, with a fresh breeze
  from the north, to enable us to keep abreast of the Fury, which,
  on account of the strong southerly current, we could only do by
  beating at some distance from the land. The breadth of the ice
  inshore continued increasing during the day, but we could see no
  end to the water in which we were beating, either to the
  southward or eastward. Advantage was taken of the little leisure
  now allowed us to let the people mend and wash their clothes,
  which they had scarcely had a moment to do for the last three
  weeks. We also completed the thrumming of a second sail for
  putting under the Fury's keel, whenever we should be enabled to
  haul her off the shore. It fell quite calm in the evening, when
  the breadth of the ice inshore had increased to six or seven
  miles. We did not, during the day, perceive any current setting
  to the southward, but in the course of the night we were drifted
  four or five leagues to the south-westward, in which situation we
  had a distinct view of a large extent of land, which had before
  been seen for the first time by some of our gentlemen, who walked
  from where the Fury lay. This land trends very much to the
  westward, a little beyond the Fury Point, the name by which I
  have distinguished that headland, near which we had attempted to
  heave the Fury down, and which is very near the southern part of
  the coast seen in the year 1819. It then sweeps round into a
  large bay, formed by a long, low beach, several miles in extent,
  afterwards joining higher land, and running in a south-easterly
  direction to <a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>a point which
  terminated our view of it in that quarter, and which bore from us
  S. 58&deg; W., distant six or seven leagues. This headland I
  named Cape Garry, after my worthy friend, Nicholas Garry, Esq.,
  one of the most active members of the Hudson's Bay Company, and a
  gentleman most warmly interested in everything connected with
  northern discovery. The whole of the bays which I named after my
  much esteemed friend, Francis Cresswell, Esq., as well as the
  land to the southward, was free from ice for several miles; and
  to the southward and eastward scarcely any was to be seen, while
  a dark water-sky indicated a perfectly navigable sea in that
  direction; but between us and the Fury there was a compact body
  of ice eight or nine miles in breadth. Had we now been at liberty
  to take advantage of the favourable prospect before us, I have
  little doubt we could, without much difficulty, have made
  considerable progress.</p>

  <p>'A southerly breeze enabling us to regain our northing, we ran
  along the margin of the ice, but were led so much to the eastward
  by it, that we could approach the ship no nearer than before
  during the whole day. She appeared to us, at this distance, to
  have a much greater heel than when the people left her, which
  made us still more anxious to get near her. A south-west wind
  gave us hopes of the ice setting off from the land, but it
  produced no good effect during the whole of the 24th. We
  therefore beat again to the southward, to see if we could manage
  to get in with the land anywhere about the shores of the bay; but
  this was now impracticable, the ice being once more closely
  packed there. We could only wait, therefore, in patience for some
  alteration in our favour. The latitude at noon was 72&deg; 34'
  57", making our distance from the Fury twelve miles, which by the
  following morning had increased to at least five leagues, the ice
  continuing to pack between us and the shore. <a name="Page_262"
  id="Page_262"></a>The wind, however, now gradually drew round to
  the westward, giving us hopes of a change, and we continued to
  ply about the margin of the ice in constant readiness for taking
  advantage of any opening that might occur. It favoured us so much
  by streaming off in the course of the day, that by seven P.M. we
  had nearly reached a channel of clear water which kept open for
  seven or eight miles from the land. Being impatient to obtain a
  sight of the Fury, and the wind becoming light, Captain Hoppner
  and myself left the Hecla in two boats, and reached the ship at
  half-past nine, or about three-quarters of an hour before high
  water, being the most favourable time of tide for arriving to
  examine her condition.</p>

  <p>'We found her heeling so much outward, that her main-channels
  were within a foot of the water; and the large floe-piece which
  was still alongside of her, seemed alone to support her below
  water, and to prevent her falling over still more considerably.
  The ship had been forced much farther up the beach than before,
  and she had now in her bilge above nine feet of water, which
  reached higher than the lower-deck beams. On looking down the
  stern-post, which, seen against the light-coloured ground, and in
  shoal water, was now very distinctly visible, we found that she
  had pushed the stones at the bottom up before her, and that the
  broken keel, stern-post, and dead wood had, by the recent
  pressure, been more damaged and turned up than before. She
  appeared principally to hang upon the ground abreast the gangway,
  where, at high water, the depth was eleven feet alongside her
  keel; forward and aft, from thirteen to sixteen feet; so that at
  low tide, allowing the usual fall of five or six feet, she would
  be lying in a depth of from five to ten feet only. The first
  hour's inspection of the Fury's condition too plainly assured me,
  that, exposed as she was, and forcibly pressed up upon an open
  and <a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>stony beach; her holds
  full of water, and the damage of her hull, to all appearance and
  in all probability, more considerable than before, without any
  adequate means of hauling her off to the seaward, or securing her
  from the incursions of the ice, every endeavour of ours to get
  her off, or <i>if</i> got off, to float her to any known place of
  safety, would at once be utterly hopeless in itself, and
  productive of extreme risk of our remaining ship.</p>

  <p>'Being anxious, however, in a case of so much importance, to
  avail myself of the judgment and experience of others, I directed
  Captain Hoppner, in conjunction with Lieutenants Austin and
  Sherer, and Mr. Pulfer, carpenter, being the officers who
  accompanied me to the Fury, to hold a survey upon her, and to
  report their opinions to me. And to prevent the possibility of
  the officers receiving any bias from my own opinion, the order
  was given to them the moment we arrived on board the Fury.</p>

  <p>'Captain Hoppner and the other officers, after spending
  several hours in attentively examining every part of the ship,
  both within and without, and maturely weighing all the
  circumstances of her situation, gave it as their opinion that it
  would be quite impracticable to make her sea-worthy, even if she
  could be hauled off, which would first require the water to be
  got out of the ship, and the holds to be once more entirely
  cleared. Mr. Pulfer, the carpenter of the Fury, considered that
  it would occupy five days to clear the ship of water; that if she
  were got off, all the pumps would not be sufficient to keep her
  free, in consequence of the additional damage she seemed to have
  sustained: and that, if even hove down, twenty days' work, with
  the means we possessed, would be required for making her
  sea-worthy. Captain Hoppner and the other officers were therefore
  of opinion, that an absolute necessity existed for abandoning
  <a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>the Fury. My own opinion
  being thus confirmed as to the utter hopelessness of saving her,
  and feeling more strongly than ever the responsibility which
  attached to me of preserving the Hecla unhurt, it was with
  extreme pain and regret that I made the signal for the Fury's
  officers and men to be sent for their clothes, most of which had
  been put on shore with the stores.</p>

  <p>'The Hecla's bower-anchor, which had been placed on the beach,
  was sent on board as soon as the people came on shore; but her
  remaining cable was too much entangled with the grounded ice to
  be disengaged without great loss of time. Having allowed the
  officers and men an hour for packing up their clothes, and what
  else belonging to them the water in the ship had not covered, the
  Fury's boats were hauled up on the beach, and at two A.M. I left
  her, and was followed by Captain Hoppner, Lieutenant Austin, and
  the last of the people in half an hour after.</p>

  <p>'The whole of the Fury's stores were, of necessity, left
  either on board her or on shore; every spare corner that we could
  find in the Hecla being now absolutely required for the
  accommodation of our double complement of officers and men, whose
  cleanliness and health could only be maintained by keeping the
  decks as clear and well ventilated as our limited space would
  permit. The spot where the Fury was left is in latitude 72&deg;
  42' 30"; the longitude by chronometers is 91&deg; 50' 05"; the
  dip of the magnetic needle, 88&deg; 19' 22"; and the variation
  129&deg; 25' westerly.'</p>

  <p>There now remains little more to be told&mdash;the accident
  that befel the Fury, the lateness of the season, and the crowded
  state of the Hecla, deprived Sir Edward Parry of all hopes of
  being able that season of accomplishing the object for which the
  expedition had been despatched.</p>

  <p>Under all these untoward circumstances, he determined <a name=
  "Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>to return to England, and on the 2nd
  of September the crew of the Fury were taken on board the Hecla,
  the boats hoisted up, the anchor stowed, and the ship's head put
  to the north-eastward.</p>

  <p>After a prosperous voyage, the whole of the Hecla and Fury's
  crews, with but two exceptions, returned in safety to their
  native country, arriving at Sheerness on the 20th of October, in
  as good health as when they quitted England eighteen months
  before.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant, now Captain Austin has, since these pages were
  written, been appointed to the command of an expedition in search
  of Sir John Franklin and his brave companions.</p>

  <p>Captain Sir Edward Parry at present holds the appointment of
  Superintendent of the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard, and Haslar

  <h2><a name="THE_MAGPIE" id="THE_MAGPIE"></a>THE MAGPIE.</h2>

  <p>It is a common and no less apposite remark that truth is
  stranger than fiction, and the longer we live, the more are we
  convinced of the force of the above axiom.</p>

  <p>The story which we are about to relate is one of the most
  remarkable incidents in a sailor's life, and, as a tale of
  horror, cannot be exceeded even in the pages of romance.</p>

  <p>In the year 1826, the Magpie, a small schooner under the
  command of Lieutenant Edward Smith, had been despatched in search
  of a piratical vessel, which had committed serious depredations
  on the western shores of the Island of Cuba.</p>

  <p>In the prosecution of this object, she was cruizing <a name=
  "Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>on the 27th of August, off the
  Colorados Roads, at the western extremity of the Island. The day
  had been extremely sultry, and towards the evening the schooner
  lay becalmed, awaiting the springing up of the land breeze, a
  blessing which only those can appreciate who have enjoyed its
  refreshing coolness after passing many hours beneath the burning
  rays of a tropical sun.</p>

  <p>About eight o'clock a slight breeze sprung up from the
  westward, and the vessel was standing under reefed mainsail,
  whole foresail, and topsail, and jib. Towards nine, the wind
  shifted to the southward, and a small dark cloud was observed
  hovering over the land. This ominous appearance, as is well
  known, is often the precursor of a coming squall, and seems as if
  sent as a warning by Providence.</p>

  <p>The lurid vapour did not escape the practised eye of the mate
  of the watch, who immediately reported the circumstance to Mr.
  Smith. All hands were turned up, and in a few minutes the
  schooner was placed in readiness to encounter the threatened
  danger.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the cloud had gradually increased in size and
  density. The slight breeze had died away, and a boding stillness
  reigned around. Suddenly a rushing, roaring sound was heard, the
  surface of the water, which a moment before was almost without a
  ripple, was now covered with one white sheet of foam, the
  schooner was taken aback; in vain her commander gave the order to
  cut away the masts&mdash;it was too late, and in less than three
  minutes from the first burst of the squall, the devoted vessel
  sunk to rise no more.</p>

  <p>At this fearful juncture, a vivid flash of lightning darted
  from the heavens, displaying for a moment, the pale faces of the
  crew struggling in the water; the wind ceased as suddenly as it
  had begun, and the ocean, as if <a name="Page_267" id=
  "Page_267"></a>unconscious of the fearful tragedy that had so
  lately been enacted upon its surface, subsided into its former
  repose.</p>

  <p>At the moment of the vessel going down, a gunner's mate, of
  the name of Meldrum, struck out and succeeded in reaching a pair
  of oars that were floating in the water,&mdash;to these he clung,
  and having divested himself of a part of his clothing, he awaited
  in dreadful anxiety the fate of his companions.</p>

  <p>Not a sound met his ear, in vain his anxious gaze endeavoured
  to pierce the gloom, but the darkness was too intense. Minutes
  appeared like hours, and still the awful silence remained
  unbroken; he felt, and the thought was agony, that out of the
  twenty-four human beings who had so lately trod the deck of the
  schooner, he alone was left. This terrible suspense became almost
  beyond the power of endurance, and he already began to envy the
  fate of his companions, when he heard a voice at no great
  distance inquiring if there was any one near. He answered in the
  affirmative, and pushing out in the direction from whence the
  sound proceeded, he reached a boat, to which seven persons were
  clinging; amongst whom was Lieutenant Smith, the commander of the
  sloop.</p>

  <p>So far this was a subject of congratulation; he was no longer
  alone; but yet the chances of his ultimate preservation were as
  distant as ever.</p>

  <p>The boat, which had been placed on the booms of the schooner,
  had fortunately escaped clear of the sinking vessel, and if the
  men had waited patiently, was large enough to have saved them
  all; but the suddenness of the calamity had deprived them of both
  thought and prudence. Several men had attempted to climb in on
  one side,&mdash;the consequence was, the boat heeled over, became
  half filled with water, and then turned keel upper<a name=
  "Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>most; and when Meldrum reached her,
  he found some stretched across the keel and others hanging on by
  the sides.</p>

  <p>Matters could not last long in this way, and Mr. Smith, seeing
  the impossibility of any of the party being saved, if they
  continued in their present position, endeavoured to bring them to
  reason, by pointing out the absurdity of their conduct. To the
  honour of the men, they listened with the same respect to their
  commander, as if they had been on board the schooner; those on
  the keel immediately relinquished their hold, and succeeded, with
  the assistance of their comrades, in righting the boat. Two of
  their number got into her and commenced baling with their hats,
  whilst the others remained in the water, supporting themselves by
  the gunwales.</p>

  <p>Order being restored, their spirits began to revive, and they
  entertained hopes of escaping from their present peril; but this
  was of short duration, and the sufferings which they had as yet
  endured, were nothing in comparison with what they had now to
  undergo.</p>

  <p>The two men had scarcely commenced baling, when the cry was
  heard of&mdash;'A shark! a shark!' No words can describe the
  consternation which ensued: it is well known the horror sailors
  have of these voracious animals, who seem apprised by instinct
  when their prey is at hand. All order was at an end, the boat
  again capsized, and the men were left struggling in the waters.
  The general safety was neglected, and it was every man for
  himself; no sooner had one got hold of the boat, than he was
  pushed away by another, and in this fruitless contest more than
  one life was nearly sacrificed.</p>

  <p>Even in this terrible hour, their commander remained cool and
  collected; his voice was still raised in words of encouragement,
  and as the dreaded enemy did not make <a name="Page_269" id=
  "Page_269"></a>its appearance, he again succeeded in persuading
  them to renew their efforts to clear the boat. The night had
  passed away&mdash;it was about ten o'clock on the morning of the
  28th; the baling had progressed without interruption; a little
  more exertion, and the boat would have been cleared, when again
  was heard the cry of&mdash;'The sharks! the sharks!' But this was
  no false alarm; the boat a second time capsized, and the unhappy
  men were literally cast amongst a shoal of these terrible
  monsters.</p>

  <p>The men, for a few minutes, remained uninjured, but not
  untouched; for the sharks actually rubbed against their victims,
  and, to use the exact words of one of the survivors, 'frequently
  passed over the boat and between us, whilst resting on the
  gunwale,' This, however, did not last long; a shriek soon told
  the fate of one of the men; a shark had seized him by the leg,
  dying the water with his blood; another shriek followed, and
  another man disappeared.</p>

  <p>But these facts are almost too horrible to dwell upon; human
  nature revolts from so terrible a picture; we will therefore
  hurry over this part of our tale.</p>

  <p>Smith had witnessed the sufferings of his followers with the
  deepest distress; and although aware that in all probability he
  must soon share the same fate, he never for a moment appeared to
  think of himself. There were but six men left, and these he
  endeavoured to sustain by his example, cheering them on to
  further exertions. They had once more recommenced their labours
  to clear out the boat, when one of his legs was seized by a
  shark. Even whilst suffering the most horrible torture, he
  restrained the expression of his feelings, for fear of increasing
  the alarm of the men. But the powers of his endurance were doomed
  to be tried to the utmost; another limb was scrunched from his
  body, and uttering a deep groan, he was about to let go his hold,
  when he <a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>was seized by two of
  his men, and placed in the stern sheets.</p>

  <p>Yet when his whole frame was convulsed with agony, the
  energies of his mind remained as strong as ever, his own pain was
  disregarded, he thought only of the preservation of his crew.
  Calling to his side a lad of the name of Wilson, who appeared to
  be the strongest of the remaining few, he exhorted him, in the
  event of his surviving, to inform the admiral that he was going
  to Cape Ontario in search of the pirate when the unfortunate
  accident occurred; 'Tell him,' he continued, 'that my men have
  done their duty, and that no blame is attached to them. I have
  but one favour to ask, and that is, that he will promote Meldrum
  to be a gunner.'</p>

  <p>He then shook each man by the hand, and bade them farewell. By
  degrees his strength began to fail, and at last became so
  exhausted, that he was unable to speak. He remained in this state
  until the sunset, when another panic seized the men, from a
  reappearance of the sharks. The boat gave a lurch, and the
  gallant commander found an end to his sufferings in a watery
  grave.</p>

  <p>Thus perished an officer, who, if it had pleased Providence to
  preserve, would, in all probability, have been one of the
  brightest ornaments of the service. His character combined the
  three great qualities which are essential for an officer and a
  seaman&mdash;courage, coolness, and decision: opportunity only
  was wanting to display these parts. If he had succeeded in
  capturing the pirate, promotion would without doubt have
  followed, and a bright and honourable career have been open to
  him. But the ways of Providence are inscrutable; it was ordained
  that he should undergo sufferings from which the bravest would
  have shrunk with horror. Had he fallen in battle, his name would
  have been recorded in <a name="Page_271" id=
  "Page_271"></a>history. We hope that our feeble efforts to rescue
  the memory of this brave seaman from sinking into oblivion will
  not have been in vain, and that his name may find an honourable
  place with others who have died in the performance of their
  duty.</p>

  <p>The death of their commander was sensibly felt by all, for
  they had long known his kindness and courage, and when his body
  sank below the waves, their hopes sank also. Mr. Maclean, a mate,
  and now the commanding officer, took upon himself to direct the
  efforts of his comrades, and did all that lay in his power to
  revive their spirits; he assured them that if they once succeeded
  in righting the boat, that there was every chance of falling in
  with some vessel. But twenty hours of constant fatigue, hunger,
  and thirst had made fearful ravages upon the strength of the men.
  Night was again approaching, and Maclean could not conceal from
  himself, that when darkness came on, the chances of their being
  seen by any vessel passing near were further removed than ever.
  The sharks had for a time taken their departure, but they might
  return at any moment; for having once tasted blood, they were not
  likely to be debarred from making another attack. Two more of the
  men, either worn out from fatigue, or anxious to escape from
  further suffering, threw themselves from their support, and were
  drowned.</p>

  <p>The burning sun again set beneath the horizon, but as yet no
  sail had been seen upon the waters. Again the land-breeze passed
  over the ocean, but it brought no refreshing coolness; it only
  reminded them of the weary hours that had elapsed since it was so
  anxiously expected, though its results were then far different
  from what they had hoped.</p>

  <p>There were but four men left&mdash;Maclean, Meldrum, (the
  gunner's mate,) Wilson, and another man. These had, by their
  united efforts, almost managed to clear the <a name="Page_272"
  id="Page_272"></a>boat of water, when, about three o'clock in the
  morning, the two latter became delirious, sprung overboard, and
  were either seized by the sharks or drowned. It will be
  remembered, that it was Wilson who was selected by poor Smith to
  convey his last message to the admiral.</p>

  <p>The two survivors for a time forgot their own sufferings in
  the horrible scene which they had just witnessed; but this did
  not last long; their thoughts soon returned to the necessity of
  preserving their own lives. They once more resumed their labours,
  and, though nearly exhausted, did not desist until the boat was
  almost dry. They then lay down to rest, in comparative security,
  and, let us hope, with their hearts filled with gratitude for the
  mercies which had already been vouchsafed to them, and
  remembering those words of our beautiful Liturgy: 'That it may
  please Thee to succour, help, and comfort all that are in danger,
  necessity, or tribulation.'</p>

  <p>It is said that sometimes the criminal, the night before his
  execution, forgets the fate that awaits him in a deep and
  refreshing slumber. These two men, in spite of the horrors they
  had undergone, fell into a sound sleep, from which they did not
  awake until the sun was high in the heavens; when the horrors of
  their situation broke upon them, rendered doubly painful by the
  temporary oblivion of the last few hours.</p>

  <p>The sun darted its scorching rays upon the two solitary
  beings, who had planted themselves, one in the bows, and the
  other in the stern of the boat, with neither oars, mast, sail,
  nor provisions of any kind. In vain they strained their gaze in
  every direction; nothing was to be seen but a boundless expanse
  of waters. Their eyes met, but it needed no words to tell the
  hopeless despair which was gnawing at their hearts. No longer was
  the loss of their companions regarded with horror; <a name=
  "Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>they envied the fate which had
  spared them the torture which they themselves were doomed to
  suffer:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span>Famine, despair, cold, thirst, and heat had
      done<br /></span> <span>Their work on them by turns.
      BYRON.<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Death at that moment would have been welcome.</p>

  <p>Hour after hour passed away, but still the boat remained
  motionless on the waters. Neither spoke; their hearts were too
  full for utterance: in rapid succession, every thought and action
  of their lives passed across their minds; home, kindred, friends,
  all would be remembered, only again to be banished by the pangs
  of hunger and thirst.</p>

  <p>Towards eight o'clock in the morning, the energies of Maclean
  and his companion had almost sunk under the accumulated load of
  suffering; it was more in despair than with any expectation of
  success, that they once again cast their eyes around. But this
  time it was not in vain; a white speck was seen in the distance:
  both exclaimed, 'A sail! a sail!' and the extravagance of joy was
  now equal to their former despair. Still the vessel was several
  miles distant, and unless those on board kept a vigilant
  look-out, it was more than probable that they would escape
  observation.</p>

  <p>Of all the ills to which the human frame is liable, the agony
  of suspense is the most intolerable. Hope and fear rose
  alternately in their breasts; at one moment, the ship appeared to
  be nearing, at another, she seemed further off than ever. The
  vessel sped slowly on its course, but to their excited minds the
  time seemed interminable. First the white canvas was seen, then
  the dark hull became visible; but as yet no signs gave token that
  those on board were aware of their proximity.</p>

  <p>The brig, for such she now appeared, could not have been above
  half a mile distant, when she suddenly altered <a name="Page_274"
  id="Page_274"></a>her course. In vain they both hailed at once,
  and waved their jackets as a signal, but no notice was taken;
  then, indeed, every hope was dispelled, and the bitterness of
  despair returned with redoubled force.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, Meldrum resolved, at all hazards, to attempt
  to swim to the vessel. If he remained in the boat, certain death
  would be the fate of himself and his companion: on the other
  hand, he might perish in the sea, but if he reached the brig,
  both would be saved. Without a moment's hesitation, he
  communicated his design to Maclean, and then, committing himself
  to the pretection of the Almighty, sprang overboard.</p>

  <p>The idea of solitude is so repugnant to human nature, that
  even death would be preferable. It can be therefore easily
  imagined that it was with feelings almost amounting to agony that
  Maclean saw himself separated from his last friend. His first
  impulse was to follow his companion, but better judgment
  prevailed, and he determined to await the result. Never for a
  single instant did his eyes turn from the bold swimmer: they
  followed his every stroke. At one time, he thought he had sunk;
  at another, the ripple of a wave appeared to his distorted
  imagination like the fin of a shark. Anxiety for the fate of his
  companion kept his mind on the stretch until distance rendered
  the object no longer visible. 'Then, indeed, did he feel that he
  was alone.'</p>

  <p>Meldrum was naturally a good swimmer, and every nerve was
  strained in this last struggle for life; buoyed up by hope, he
  had accomplished about two-thirds of his weary task when his
  strength began to fail, his dying eyes turned towards the brig,
  and with one last effort he raised his voice. He was heard: a
  boat was lowered from the brig, and he was taken on board. The
  perilous situation of his comrade was made known; and thus by his
  <a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>gallant exertions were
  preserved the lives of the two survivors, of the ill-fated
  Magpie.</p>

  <p>This tale might almost be discredited, but the facts from
  which it was taken bear the signature of the officers composing
  the court-martial who sat upon the two remaining men. Mr. Maclean
  is at the present moment alive, and is now serving as a
  lieutenant in the coast-guard. Meldrum was promoted for his
  gallantry to the rank of gunner, and died two years ago.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_THETIS" id="THE_THETIS"></a>THE THETIS.</h2>

  <p>His Majesty's ship, Thetis, Captain Samuel Burgess, sailed
  from Rio Janeiro on the evening of the 4th of December, 1830,
  having a large amount of treasure on board. The weather was so
  thick, that as they worked out of the harbour, the islands at its
  entrance were not visible; but as the evening was tolerably fine,
  with the exception of the fog, Captain Burgess determined to
  persevere in his course. The following morning the fog dispersed,
  but it was soon succeeded by such heavy rain, that the obscurity
  was nearly as great as before. The ship continued her course with
  the wind upon the starboard tack, until half-past one in the
  afternoon, when, from the reckoning, they supposed Cape Frio to
  be about thirty-eight miles distant, lying north 36&deg; east.
  From the hour of their departure from Rio Janeiro, till the time
  of which we speak, neither sun, moon, nor stars had been visible.
  On account of the cross sea, which appeared to impede the
  progress of the vessel, and the lightness of the wind, her course
  was kept east by north until two o'clock, when it was changed
  <a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>to E.N.E. At four o'clock
  P.M. it was calculated that they had run about nineteen miles,
  and that they must be nearly abreast of Cape Frio, and about
  twenty-four miles distant from it. The weather clearing up at
  that time, they discovered a large ship, with all sail set,
  standing in shore, and no land being visible, they concluded that
  they were still further from land than they had reckoned, and
  therefore they changed their course again to N.E. by E. At five
  o'clock the people were mustered at quarters, and then a looming
  of land was seen to the N.N.W., which, according to their
  calculation, was the direction Cape Frio would bear; and there
  being no land near it that could have the same appearance, the
  reckoning was considered correct, and a prudent proportion of
  sail was made, regard being had to the state of the weather, and
  the course they were steering. Between six and seven o'clock P.M.
  the rain again began to fall; the fog returned, and became
  gradually so thick, that it was impossible to see the length of
  the ship.</p>

  <p>At eight P.M. the watch was mustered, and the men placed at
  their stations to keep a vigilant look-out, while the officer of
  the watch went forward himself to see that the sails were well
  trimmed, and that every one was on the alert. At half-past eight,
  when the captain had retired to his cabin, and was waiting for
  the usual evening report from the master, a midshipman entered
  with the startling intelligence that land had been seen close
  ahead, the ship at the time going at the rate of eight or nine
  miles an hour.</p>

  <p>Captain Burgess was on deck in a moment; he ordered the helm
  to be put 'hard a-port,' and was told it had been done. The next
  instant the jib-booms and bowsprit were heard to crash; the
  captain hastened to the gangway, and was just in time to see the
  foremast go. Scarcely had he called to the men to stand clear,
  when <a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>all the three masts
  fell aft, one after the other, covering the deck with masts,
  yards, sails, and rigging, and in their fall killing some and
  dreadfully mangling others. Within a few feet of the ship rose a
  stupendous black rock, against which the surf was raging
  violently. The rock was so perpendicular, that both the fore and
  main yardarms were (before they fell) scraping against the
  granite cliff. The hull, however, did not appear to come in
  contact with the rock; but, as if answering the helm, her head
  turned off shore, and as she swung round, the larboard quarter
  boat was completely smashed between the ship's side and the rock.
  Nothing could exceed the alarm that prevailed on board for a few
  minutes after the sudden crash. The decks were covered with spars
  and rigging, lying pell-mell upon the bodies of those who had
  been injured by their fall. The man at the helm had been killed
  at his post, and the wheel itself was shivered to atoms; whilst
  the darkness of the night, and the roar of the breakers against
  the cliff, added to the horrors of a catastrophe of which the
  suddenness alone was sufficient to paralyse the energies of the
  men.</p>

  <p>Captain Burgess saw that everything depended upon promptitude
  and decision: he quickly rallied his people, and order was soon
  restored: he then gave directions that the well should be
  sounded, and that the men should stand by the small bower
  anchor.</p>

  <p>A sentinel was placed to guard the spirit-room, and two small
  sails were run up the fore and main-masts, the stumps of which
  were from twelve to fifteen feet above the deck, and the helm was
  put to starboard. The winches were next manned, and guns,
  rockets, and blue lights let off in rapid succession.</p>

  <p>The well was reported dry; orders were given for the small
  bower anchor to be let go, but it was found covered with the
  wreck of the bowsprit, and it was necessary to <a name="Page_278"
  id="Page_278"></a>cut away the best bower in order to keep the
  ship off shore; and for the same purpose every spar that could be
  obtained was made use of to bear her off the rocky cliffs, but in
  vain, for from the depth of the water, the anchor did not reach
  the bottom, and the stern tailed upon a shelving rock in spite of
  all their efforts. The men were next ordered to clear away the
  boats and get them ready&mdash;but they were found totally
  destroyed. Those on the quarters had been smashed by the rocks,
  and those on the booms and stern by the falling of the masts.
  During the whole of this anxious period, the conduct of the men
  was most exemplary. Aware that all depended upon individual
  exertion, each one appeared to emulate the example set by his
  officers, and worked with hearty good will; not a single instance
  of anything like bad conduct occurred.</p>

  <p>Their condition was most disheartening; the boats were no
  longer available; the water was gaining on the vessel; and the
  rockets and blue lights, as they darted into the air, served but
  to show them the rugged face of the high rocks, which appeared to
  afford no footing by which the summit could be gained, even if
  they should be so fortunate as to reach them at all.</p>

  <p>Whilst all on board were weighing these chances of destruction
  or of safety, the vessel's head had gone round off, and a few
  succeeding heavy surfs threw her again with her starboard quarter
  upon the rock, and whilst she was in this position, there
  appeared a possibility of getting some of the people on shore.
  Captain Burgess, therefore, ordered Lieutenant Hamilton to do
  everything in his power to facilitate such a proceeding, and
  shortly afterwards that officer, Mr. Mends, midshipman, and about
  seventy others, effected a landing by jumping either from the
  broken end of the mainyard, which was lying across the ship, or
  from the hammock <a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>netting
  abaft the mizenmast; several others who attempted to land in the
  same way were less fortunate; some were crushed to death, and
  some drawn back by the recoil of the surf and drowned.</p>

  <p>From the time the ship first struck, the current had been
  carrying her along the cliffs at the rate of at least a quarter
  of a mile an hour; it now carried her off the rock, and she
  drifted along shore, a helpless wreck, at the mercy of the winds
  and waves. The captain saw that nothing more could be done for
  the vessel, and therefore he directed all his energies to the
  preservation of the crew. The marine who had been appointed to
  guard the spirit-room still remained at his post, and never left
  it till commanded to do so by his superior officer, even after
  the water had burst open the hatch. We mention this as an
  instance of the effect of good discipline in times of the
  greatest peril.</p>

  <p>The vessel, or rather the wreck, was now carried towards a
  small cove, into which she happily drifted; she struck heavily
  against the rocks, then gave some tremendous yauls, and gradually
  sunk until nothing was left above water but the bows, the broken
  bowsprit, and the wreck of the masts as they laid on the
  booms.</p>

  <p>All on board deemed that the crisis of their fate had
  arrived,&mdash;and they prepared for the final struggle between
  life and death. There were some moments of awful suspense, for
  every lurch the ill-fated vessel gave, was expected to be the
  last; but when she seemed to sink no deeper, there came the hope
  that her keel had touched the bottom, and that they should not
  all he engulfed in a watery grave.</p>

  <p>Before she sunk, the frigate's bows had gone so close into the
  rocks as to enable some sixty or seventy people to jump on shore;
  and a hawser was got out and fixed to a rock, by which several
  others were saved; but by a <a name="Page_280" id=
  "Page_280"></a>tremendous surge, the piece of rock to which the
  hawser was fastened was broken away, and for a time all
  communication with the land was suspended. They tried every means
  that could be devised to convey a rope from the ship to the land,
  but for a long time without success, until Mr. Geach, the
  boatswain, swung himself on the stump of the bowsprit, and by
  making fast two belaying pins to the end of a line, he succeeded
  in throwing it on shore. To this a stronger cable was bent, and
  it was dragged through the surf by the people on the rocks, who
  then kept it taut.</p>

  <p>Although a few words only are required to describe the mode by
  which a communication was established between the ship and the
  shore, yet it had been a work of toil, time, and danger. The
  boatswain had more than once nearly lost his life by being washed
  away by the waves as they swept over the wreck; the captain, who
  directed his proceedings, was standing up to his middle in water,
  upon one foot only, frequently losing his hold, and with great
  difficulty regaining his position.</p>

  <p>The boatswain, when the preparations were completed, suggested
  that, in order to test the strength of the cable, a boy should be
  the first to make a trial of it; accordingly, a young lad was
  firmly secured to a sort of cradle or bowling knot, and drawn on
  shore in safety. The success of the attempt was announced by a
  loud cheer from the strand, and the captain then took upon
  himself to direct the landing of the rest of the crew by the same
  means. He stationed himself on the knight head, so as to prevent
  a general rush being made; he then called each man separately,
  and one by one they slung themselves upon the rope and were swung
  on shore. Nothing could exceed the good conduct displayed by the
  whole of the ship's company, every order was promptly obeyed, and
  the utmost patience and firmness exhibited by every
  individual.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>When the greater part of
  the people had quitted the wreck, there still remained several
  who could not be induced even by the earnest and repeated
  entreaties of their commander to leave their <i>dry</i> position
  on the yards. The strength of the captain and boatswain was
  almost exhausted, and as they could not persuade any more of the
  men to avail themselves of the proffered means of safety, they
  were obliged, though very reluctantly, to leave them on the
  wreck, and they themselves joined the crew on the rocks.</p>

  <p>In the course of an hour or two, however, the party who had
  stayed by the wreck, took courage and ventured upon the rope; but
  as the stump of the bowsprit, which was over the larboard
  cathead, rendered it extremely hazardous to come forward, they
  did not all get on shore till daylight. In the morning, Captain
  Burgess's first care was to muster his men, and a melancholy
  spectacle presented itself. Sixteen were missing, and of those
  who were gathered around him, many had been dreadfully bruised
  and lacerated in their efforts to reach the shore. Amongst those
  who perished was a fine spirited lad, the son of Captain Bingham,
  late commander of the Thetis. But a few months before, Captain
  Bingham himself had been drowned in the Guayaquil: thus father
  and son lay far from their native land, beneath the western
  flood.</p>

  <p>The crew of the Thetis had now time to look around them, and
  to consider what was next to be done. The <a name="Page_282" id=
  "Page_282"></a>prospect was a sad one. Before them, and almost
  hidden by the white foam, lay the once noble frigate, now a
  complete wreck; the cove into which she had drifted was bound by
  lofty and precipitous crags, arising abruptly from the sea, and
  varying in height from 80 to 194 feet. The men and officers were
  perched in groups on points of the rocks; few of them had
  clothing enough to cover them, and scarcely any had shoes. There
  seemed to be no means of ascending the precipice; but to do so
  must be their first object; and anxiously they sought for some
  part which might offer a surer footing, and a less perilous and
  perpendicular ascent. At last they succeeded in casting a rope
  round one of the projecting crags, and by help of this some of
  the strongest of the party climbed the giddy height, and then
  assisted in hauling up their weaker comrades.</p>

  <p>To give some idea of the difficulties which they had to
  surmount, and their almost miraculous escape, we subjoin the
  following description of the place from the pen of Captain
  Dickenson:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'The coast is formed of rugged and almost perpendicular rocks,
  varying from 80 to 194 feet in height, a peak rising at each
  point, and another in nearly the centre of the north-eastern
  side.</p>

  <p>'On viewing this terrific place, with the knowledge that at
  the time of the shipwreck the wind was from the southward, I was
  struck with astonishment, and it appeared quite a mystery that so
  great a number of lives could have been saved; and indeed it will
  never cease to be so, for that part on which the crew landed is
  so difficult of access, that (even in fine weather) after being
  placed by a boat on a rock at the base, it required considerable
  strength and agility, with the assistance of a man-rope, to climb
  the precipitous face of the cliff, and I am certain that in the
  hour of extreme peril, when <a name="Page_283" id=
  "Page_283"></a>excess of exertion was called forth, there must
  have been a most extraordinary display of it by a few for the
  benefit of the whole.'</p>

  <p>When the party were all safely landed on the top of the rocks,
  they perceived that they were on an island without inhabitants,
  and affording no shelter, except a few huts, that had been
  erected for the convenience of the natives curing fish.
  Fortunately these huts contained a considerable quantity of salt
  fish and farina. This was placed in charge of the purser, and
  immediately distributed amongst the ship's company, who stood in
  great need of refreshment. As soon as the men were sufficiently
  recovered from their fatigues, they were despatched in parties in
  all directions, to discover means of communicating with the
  mainland, from which the island was a few miles distant. Most of
  them soon returned with the tidings that no means of transport
  could be procured. This was a very disheartening announcement;
  but its effects were quickly dispelled by the appearance of a
  canoe coming into the little cove where the huts were
  situated.</p>

  <p>The seamen made signals to the men in the canoe, inviting them
  to approach, which they did; and when they came up, they
  communicated the welcome intelligence, that round a point to the
  left, on the mainland, there was a village which afforded all
  kinds of accommodation.</p>

  <p>Captain Burgess then ordered Lieutenant Hamilton to go in a
  canoe, with two or three of his men, to this village, and there
  to make arrangements for proceeding to the commander-in-chief at
  Rio Janeiro, and to send off as many canoes as he could procure
  to convey the ship's company to the mainland.</p>

  <p>In a short time several canoes arrived at the island, and Mr.
  Drake, the purser of the Thetis, was amongst <a name="Page_284"
  id="Page_284"></a>the first sent off to the village, with
  directions to despatch a sufficient quantity of provisions for
  the people on the rock; but after making two or three trips
  between the parties, Mr. Wilson, the master's assistant, returned
  in one of the canoes to say, that the natives refused to come
  again without being paid. In this dilemma, Captain Burgess went
  across himself, and by dint of persuasion and promises of
  payment, he at last induced some of the natives to go to the
  assistance of his people; and in the course of a few hours as
  many were conveyed to the village as was deemed prudent. It was
  necessary to leave some men to look after the wreck; and to this
  duty Lieutenant Otway, Mr. Mends, midshipman, the gunner,
  carpenter, four marines, and thirty-three seamen, were appointed:
  they therefore remained on the island; and before night Captain
  Burgess had the satisfaction of seeing all the rest of his crew,
  if not very comfortably lodged, at least safe and under shelter.
  In the evening, Lieutenant Hamilton set out overland to Rio
  Janeiro to apprise the commander-in-chief of the loss of the
  Thetis, and the distressing situation of her men.</p>

  <p>The following morning the people had great difficulty in
  hiring canoes, and only one could be obtained, in which
  Lieutenant West and the boatswain went off to the wreck, where
  they were for several days actively employed. None of the men
  were allowed to be idle, for they had full occupation in carrying
  wood and water, which were only to be found at a great
  distance.</p>

  <p>The behaviour of the local authorities was disgraceful in the
  extreme; although fully aware of the destitute condition of the
  Englishmen who had been cast upon their shores, they denied them
  the most trifling assistance, and turned a deaf ear to every
  entreaty and remonstrance.</p>

  <p>Money! money! was the constant cry. In vain <a name="Page_285"
  id="Page_285"></a>Captain Burgess assured them that the little he
  had saved was almost expended; but that as soon as assistance
  should arrive from his countrymen, every article should be paid
  for. All his arguments and promises were thrown away upon the
  natives, whose rapacity knew no bounds; they would give nothing
  without payment, and their charges were exorbitant.</p>

  <p>Captain Burgess was so exasperated at one of these natives,
  who had agreed to let the crew have a small bullock, but, upon
  finding there was no money to pay for it, had driven it away,
  that he thought it almost justifiable to desire his men to help
  themselves. There was, however, one bright exception to this
  universal hard-heartedness. A sergeant, named Antonio das Santos,
  who commanded a small fort of three guns, seeing the
  unwillingness of the natives to render any aid to the strangers,
  came forward and asked if anything was wanted that he could
  supply. Captain Burgess replied, that both his officers and men
  stood in great need of food, and that a loan of money for present
  use would be very acceptable. The sergeant immediately placed in
  the captain's hands forty milreas in copper, and most generously
  put at his disposal everything he possessed. The example of this
  noble-hearted fellow had no effect on the conduct of the rest;
  their great object seemed to be to make as much gain as possible
  by the misfortunes of their fellow-creatures, and they went so
  far as to plunder the wreck, breaking open the chests, and taking
  possession of their contents whenever an opportunity
  occurred.</p>

  <p>In order to attract the notice of vessels passing near, two
  flag-staffs had been erected upon the heights, with the ensign
  downwards; but day after day passed on, and no friendly sail
  appeared. The cupidity of the natives was insatiable, and
  provisions became more and more <a name="Page_286" id=
  "Page_286"></a>scarce. It was not until the 15th of December, ten
  days after the loss of the Thetis, that a vessel was seen in the
  offing. She proved to be the Algerine, which arrived most
  opportunely, when they were almost reduced to extremity, and
  brought them the articles of which they were in greatest
  need.</p>

  <p>The next day, just after the Algerine had entered the harbour
  of Cape Frio, Admiral Baker arrived with a necessary supply of
  money. He had attempted the sea-passage from Rio Janeiro, for
  three days, in his barge, but had been obliged to put back on
  account of the current, and had then performed the journey of
  seventy miles overland in forty-eight hours. From the admiral,
  Captain Burgess had the satisfaction of hearing that the Druid,
  Clio, Adelaide, and a French brig of war might be hourly
  expected.</p>

  <p>These all arrived in due course, and took on board the
  officers and men of the late Thetis, who were safely landed at
  Rio Janeiro on the 24th of December.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, we cannot refrain from noticing the firmness
  and presence of mind evinced by Captain Burgess under the most
  appalling circumstances. After having adopted every available
  means for saving the ship without effect, he superintended for
  many hours the disembarkation of the crew, and during all that
  tedious process he was standing in a heavy surf up to the middle
  in water; nor could he be persuaded to quit the wreck until not
  one more of his officers or men would consent to go before him.
  Respecting the conduct of the officers and men, we cannot do
  better than lay before our readers Captain Burgess's own estimate
  of its merits.</p>

  <p>'I owe,' he says, 'to the whole of my officers and men (and
  which most sincerely and unreservedly I render,) the meed of
  praise due to the conduct of every one, without exception. It was
  their prompt obedience to <a name="Page_287" id=
  "Page_287"></a>all my orders, and the firmness, fortitude, and
  alacrity which they perseveringly as well as patiently displayed
  amidst their great perils, sufferings, and privations, through
  the whole of this trying scene, that contributed, under
  Providence, to the saving of so many of their lives.</p>

  <p>'Their subsequent orderly and excellent conduct on shore as
  much bespeaks my approbation; and, in truth, the general
  character of their conduct throughout has induced an esteem in me
  which it is impossible can ever cease but with my life.'<a name=
  "FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href=

  <p>Captain Samuel Burgess entered the navy in 1790, and served on
  board the Impregnable at the victory of the 1st of June, 1794. He
  was almost constantly employed from that time until the year
  1804, when he was appointed a lieutenant on board the Prince, of
  98 guns, in which ship he was present at the battle of
  Trafalgar.</p>

  <p>He next served on board the Dreadnought, 98, and subsequently
  was appointed to the command of the Pincher, a 12-gun brig,
  employed in the North Sea and Baltic. Whilst in command of this
  vessel, Lieutenant Burgess distinguished himself on many
  occasions, particularly in assisting Lord George Stuart in
  reducing the batteries of Cuxhaven and Bremerleke. His next
  appointment was to the Vixen gun-brig; and although he might well
  have expected promotion for his services, he remained lieutenant
  until the year 1816, when he was appointed to the Queen
  Charlotte, in which ship he <a name="Page_288" id=
  "Page_288"></a>served as flag-lieutenant to Lord Exmouth at the
  bombardment of Algiers. Upon the arrival of the dispatches in
  England, Lieutenant Burgess was promoted to the rank of
  commander. He received his post rank on the 27th November, 1830,
  when he took the command of the Thetis. A more lengthened
  statement of the services of this officer will be found in
  O'Byrne's <i>Naval Biography</i>, to which work we are indebted
  for the above sketch.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_FIREFLY" id="THE_FIREFLY"></a>THE FIREFLY.</h2>

  <p>The Firefly, a small schooner, with a crew of about fifty men,
  was proceeding on her voyage from Belize to Jamaica, on the 27th
  of February, 1835. The wind had been moderate during the day, and
  as they were steering a course laid down in the chart, no danger
  was anticipated.</p>

  <p>Between nine and ten o'clock at night, the greater part of the
  crew, with the exception of those whose duty it was to be upon
  deck, had retired below, when the seaman in charge of the watch
  reported to the commander, Lieutenant Julius McDonnell, that it
  was very dark ahead. He instantly went upon deck, when the sound
  of surf breaking upon rocks was distinctly heard. The helm was
  put down, under the hopes of staying the vessel, but as the wind
  was light, and a heavy swell setting in at the time, she did not
  come round, but getting stern-way, struck with a shock which made
  every timber vibrate, and appeared to threaten instant
  destruction to the vessel. All were in a moment upon deck; the
  sweeps were got out on the larboard side, the best <a name=
  "Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>bower anchor let go, and the boats
  hoisted out, and ordered to sound, whilst the cutter was sent to
  carry out the stream anchor. The cable was then held taut, but
  snapped almost immediately: the best bower came home, and the
  small bower was let go. In the meantime, the wind had shifted to
  the northward, and was blowing in heavy squalls, and their small
  bower anchor, which was their sole dependence, came home.</p>

  <p>Everything that could be done was put into practice to save
  the vessel, but all in vain; and when daylight broke, her
  commander saw that there was nothing now left him but to take
  measures for preserving the lives of the crew.</p>

  <p>For this purpose, all the officers and men were set to work to
  construct rafts, as the boats were not sufficient to contain the
  whole of the crew. Between six and seven o'clock in the morning,
  one raft was completed, and the cutter and gig prepared to
  receive the men. The vessel was all this time rapidly breaking
  up; the bolts of her keelson and the stempost had started; the
  deck was broken in, and there was but little hope of her holding
  together many hours.</p>

  <p>One officer, Mr. Nopps, the master's assistant, had been
  placed in the cutter, to prevent the men from taking away
  anything save the clothes they had on. Eighteen were already in
  the boat, including Captain West (an engineer officer) and his
  son, and fifteen were mustered in the raft, which was lashed to
  the larboard of the wreck, when from some accident the raft got
  adrift, and was carried away by the current. This proved most
  unfortunate, as the raft was their great resource; and all on
  board of her would inevitably have perished, had not the cutter
  pushed out to their assistance. A rope was fastened to the raft,
  and they attempted to tow her back to the schooner; but as the
  cutter had only <a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>four oars,
  and the wind set so strong to the southward, they were unable to
  reach the schooner.</p>

  <p>Those who remained upon the wreck had only the gig left; and
  as this could contain but a few, Lieutenant McDonnell thought it
  advisable to direct an officer to take on board the sick, and
  proceed for assistance to Belize, and if he fell in with the
  cutter to send her back to the schooner. The gig accordingly
  shoved off, but again returned, in consequence of an accident
  having happened to the mast; this being remedied, she again
  pulled away from the wreck and having fallen in with the cutter,
  communicated the orders of Mr. McDonnell for her return. This, as
  has before been shown, was impossible, and the gig having taken
  on board Captain West and his son, parted from the cutter, with
  the intention of proceeding to Belize.</p>

  <p>When Lieutenant McDonnell saw that the cutter did not return,
  he directed and assisted the men who remained upon the wreck to
  construct a second raft. This, after considerable labour, was
  completed by the following morning: it was then launched
  overboard, and made fast to the rocks within the reef. As the
  wreck still held together, Mr. McDonnell considered it prudent to
  remain by her as long as possible, in the hope that some
  assistance might arrive from Belize: but in this he was
  disappointed. In the meantime, another and stronger raft had been
  formed from the after part of the quarter-deck, which had been
  broken up by the sea; this also was launched, and brought forward
  under the bows. The men almost hoped against hope, but yet no
  assistance arrived. Fortunately, the weather was partially
  moderate, but still the sufferings, from exposure to the weather,
  and the deprivation of proper food, were severely felt; and
  Lieutenant McDonnell determined, under all these circumstances,
  to wait no longer, and on <a name="Page_291" id=
  "Page_291"></a>the 4th of March everything was in readiness to
  quit the wreck. A small barrel of bread was placed on the raft,
  but this was immediately washed off into the sea. A beaker
  one-third full of rum was then fastened more securely, and this
  was the only thing that they could take with them.</p>

  <p>All having embarked, they started with the intention of
  steering towards a cay which was in sight, but the current proved
  too strong, and the raft was swept into deep water. The sail was
  then set, and they steered in the direction of what was supposed
  to be a wreck, or vessel, in the same situation as themselves;
  but on nearing, it proved to be a sand-bore, on which people were
  distinctly seen walking to and fro. They immediately conjectured
  that these must be the crew of one of the boats, a supposition
  which afterwards proved to be correct. Every effort was made to
  gain the bank, but the current was too strong, and they found it
  impossible to reach any part of the reef.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant McDonnell, who had been suffering some days from
  ill health, was now so exhausted that he was obliged to be
  supported upon the raft. He was, therefore, unable to give any
  commands; and, after a short consultation, it was considered best
  to stand out to sea, in the hopes of falling in with some vessel.
  The night had set in, and they steered a course westward. On the
  following morning a white bottom was seen, but immediately
  afterwards the raft was again in deep water. All this time they
  had nothing to eat; their sole subsistence being a small quantity
  of rum, which was served out at stated intervals.</p>

  <p>The following morning, about eight o'clock, land was observed
  right ahead, and they endeavoured to steer in that direction; but
  their progress, from the heavy construction of the raft, was
  necessarily very slow, and it <a name="Page_292" id=
  "Page_292"></a>was not until sunset that they found themselves
  about nine or ten miles from the shore. All the next night they
  stood in the same direction; and about four or five o'clock in
  the morning, as near as they could guess, they were cast by the
  surf upon the beach. Utterly prostrate with the fatigues they had
  undergone, they threw themselves upon the sand, and soon found in
  sleep a brief forgetfulness of their past cares and troubles.
  They did not awake for many horn's, when, upon looking around,
  they discovered that the commander was absent. This, however,
  gave them no uneasiness, as it was supposed that he had gone in
  search of assistance. The first object was to proceed in quest of
  water, of which they stood in most need. They had gone for more
  than a mile without finding anything to moisten their lips, or
  any signs of habitation, when one of the men discovered a
  cocoa-nut tree: here was both food and drink, and with avidity
  they seized upon the fruit, and found relief from their most
  urgent wants.</p>

  <p>Amongst the party who were cast on shore were Mr. Malcolm, a
  master's assistant, and Mr. Price, a merchant; these, with the
  rest of the men, proceeding a little further into the woods,
  became so fatigued that they were obliged to return to the place
  where they were first cast, whilst their companions prosecuted
  the search for Lieutenant McDonnell, whose continued absence had
  given the greatest alarm.</p>

  <p>About one o'clock, some of the men returned, but brought no
  tidings of the commander; they said that the rest of the men had
  determined to walk round the cay, as they conjectured the place
  on which they were cast was Ambegris Cay, and more especially as
  Mr. Price, who had been long a resident at Honduras, had assured
  them that to the south-east there was a plantation belonging to
  one of his friends.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>About two hours
  afterwards the men returned, but neither their endeavours to find
  a habitation nor any traces of Lieutenant McDonnell had been
  successful. They said that it had been their intention to walk
  round the cay, but from the appearance of the coast, they did not
  think it was possible to do so that day. It was then proposed
  that they should rest where they were during night, and renew
  their search at an early hour next morning.</p>

  <p>Whilst they were sitting on the beach, one of the men thought
  he saw Mr. McDonnell running in the surf, about half a mile
  distant. Ritchie, the gunner's mate, immediately proceeded in the
  direction where he was supposed to be, and found that unfortunate
  officer in a state of delirium. He endeavoured to persuade him to
  come down to where the rest of the men were assembled, but a few
  incoherent words were his only reply. Ritchie was, therefore,
  obliged to return to his comrades for assistance; and having
  communicated the sad condition of their officer, they all
  proceeded together to the spot where he was last seen, but found
  no traces of the commander. Search was made in every direction,
  but in vain; and as night was approaching, they were reluctantly
  obliged to return to the place which they had fixed upon as their
  rendezvous. In their way thither they gathered some more
  cocoa-nuts, and having satisfied their hunger and thirst, lay
  down to rest, under the canopy of heaven, and with no softer bed
  than what the sandy beach afforded.</p>

  <p>The next morning the men again declared their intention of
  walking in search of the plantation mentioned by Mr. Price. Mr.
  Malcolm, who had become the senior officer in the absence of Mr.
  McDonnell, advised them to remain where they were, and to build a
  hut, and dig a well for water; he assured them that, as long as
  there was <a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>a plentiful supply
  of cocoa-nuts, they could not starve, and that the chances were,
  assistance would arrive. All was, however, to no purpose; they
  would not listen to any argument, and even disregarded his
  authority. It was as much as he could do to insist upon their
  first going in search of their commander.</p>

  <p>After a long time employed for this purpose, they discovered
  Mr. McDonnell asleep beneath a parmetta tree. Upon hearing
  footsteps approaching, he awoke, but in such a feeble state that
  he was unable to rise without assistance, and from the wildness
  of his manner, there was too much reason to fear that his reason
  had fled. They gave him some cocoa-nut milk, which he eagerly
  drank, and this appeared to give him some relief. With difficulty
  they made him comprehend that they intended to proceed to the
  plantation for assistance, but he refused to join them, alleging
  that a boat was coming for him. In a short time he appeared a
  little more collected, and agreed to join the expedition. There
  still remained a small supply of rum, and a portion of this being
  poured into some empty cocoa-nuts, it was distributed equally
  amongst the men, and they all commenced their journey, the men
  about 200 yards ahead, and Mr. McDonnell, supported by Malcolm
  and Mr. Price, brought up the rear.</p>

  <p>After proceeding in this way about two miles, Mr. McDonnell's
  strength utterly failed, and he sank down upon the ground,
  declaring that he could go no further; every entreaty was urged
  to persuade him to make another effort, but both the powers of
  the mind and body had deserted the unfortunate officer, and
  Malcolm and his companion were at a loss to know what course to
  pursue. After a brief consultation they determined to leave Mr.
  McDonnell, and as soon as they reached the plantation, which Mr.
  Price declared could not be far distant, return with
  assistance.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>They then once more
  resumed their journey, the men proceeding ahead as before; in the
  middle of the day they stopped to rest, and again resumed their
  march until about an hour before sunset, when they arrived at two
  cocoa-nut trees; and as these formed not only a place of shelter,
  but also a means of procuring food, they determined to remain
  there for the night. The men who had climbed up the trees, and
  were gathering fruit, descried a pond, or creek, in the wood,
  about half a mile distant. Mr. Price then observed, if that was
  the case, they were on the mainland, and not on Ambegris Cay.</p>

  <p>They were now in a great dilemma, for they were uncertain
  which way to proceed, and Mr. Malcolm endeavoured to persuade the
  men to return to the beach, assuring them that it was quite
  useless their proceeding any further, for they did not know where
  they were going; but they turned a deaf ear to every argument,
  declaring that they would walk as long as they were able. Mr.
  Price, the merchant, agreed with the rest of the men, and urged
  them to continue their journey, in the hopes that they might be
  seen by some coasting boats going to Belize. This was Saturday
  night; and after toiling all day, they had only walked ten miles
  from where they had left Mr. McDonnell. The next morning Mr.
  Malcolm again entreated the men to remain, but it was of no
  avail, and they recommenced their march.</p>

  <p>The men continued to walk together until Tuesday evening,
  subsisting upon cocoa-nuts, which they gathered on their way,
  when Malcolm was obliged to be left behind, as he was unable to
  walk any further. The next morning he was found by some natives,
  and taken to Ambegris Cay, where the men had arrived the previous
  evening.</p>

  <p>We must now return to the fate of the cutter, which <a name=
  "Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>it will be remembered left the wreck
  on the morning of the 28th of February, taking the raft in tow.
  They endeavoured to return to the schooner, but the current
  proving too strong, they were obliged to abandon the attempt, and
  ran before the wind until they made a sand-bore, on the south end
  of the reef, about an hour afterwards.</p>

  <p>They then cut the raft adrift, and landed the men that were in
  the cutter, sending the boat back with two men to carry the rest
  off the raft, as it was impossible to bring the raft to the
  sand-bore. It was about seven o'clock in the evening when they
  were all safely landed, the cutter being at this time in such a
  condition, that she could not have floated, even in smooth water,
  without baling.</p>

  <p>They then dragged the boat up the beach, where they remained
  until daylight next morning, the 1st of March. Mr. Nopps,
  master's-assistant, who was the commanding officer of the party,
  determined to leave the majority of the men on the sand-bore, and
  proceed to the wreck; he accordingly started with five men in the
  cutter, in hopes of reaching the schooner, but as it blew
  strongly from the northward, and the boat had no jib or mizen,
  and the mainmast and sprit sprung, they found it impossible to
  beat to windward. In this condition, as there was no appearance
  of the wind abating, and nothing to eat except some salt pork,
  and only two beakers of water, one of which had been drunk during
  the night, Mr. Nopps considered it his duty to take the boat with
  these five men, and run for the first place they could fetch,
  hoping to reach Belize, which was nearly before the wind.</p>

  <p>For two days they scudded before the wind, without being able
  to set any sail, and had passed at least forty miles to the
  southward of Belize, before the wind abated; during this time
  they suffered severely from want of <a name="Page_297" id=
  "Page_297"></a>water, the last beaker having been finished, and
  the salt pork increasing their thirst. It was not until twelve
  o'clock on Tuesday, the 3rd of March, that they arrived in Belize
  roads, and were taken on board the Fly.</p>

  <p>Here they received every attention that was necessary, and Mr.
  Rogers, the master of the Fly, accompanied by Mr. Nopps, was
  despatched in the Governor's schooner to the assistance of the
  men who were left on the sand-bore, and of the others who were
  still supposed to be upon the wreck.</p>

  <p>On the following Friday, the 6th of March, they reached the
  sand-bore, and having taken off the men, proceeded to the wreck,
  where they found only two men, from whom they learnt that
  Lieutenant McDonnell, and the rest of the people, had quitted the
  wreck two days previously. Pilot boats were then sent in search,
  and another party explored the coast; and after visiting Long
  Bay, without hearing any tidings, returned to Belize.</p>

  <p>In the course of two days, a boat arrived with the eight men
  who had been with McDonnell, who reported that they had left that
  officer, almost dead, in the wood.</p>

  <p>Mr. Nopps again departed in a pilot-boat in search of his
  commander, but when he reached Ambegris Cay, the boat was unable
  to beat up outside the breakers, and it came on to blow so
  violently during the night, that they were prevented from
  landing; the following day they were more successful, and Mr.
  Nopps walked up the coast. For two days his search proved
  useless, but on the third he had the pleasure of finding Mr.
  McDonnell still alive, in a hut, under the care of some Indians.
  After the lapse of two days, he was so far recovered as to be
  taken on board the pilot-boat, and arrived next morning at Belize
  Bay.</p>

  <p>It would have been happy if all connected with the <a name=
  "Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>Firefly had been equally fortunate.
  The gig, which had been sent from the wreck to Belize for
  assistance, was found several days afterwards cast upon the
  beach, broken in two, and all in her must have perished.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant McDonnell was promoted to the rank of commander in
  1846, and at present is unemployed.</p>

  <h2><a name="THE_AVENGER" id="THE_AVENGER"></a>THE AVENGER.</h2>

  <p>The Avenger, a steam frigate, with an armament of 6 heavy guns
  and 280 men, sailed from Gibraltar on the afternoon of the 17th
  of December, 1847. As her commander, Captain Charles G.E. Napier,
  was anxious to spare the coal, the steam was reduced to the least
  possible degree, leaving sufficient to work the wheels up to the
  rate of sailing. On Monday, the 20th, the steamer was running
  with square yards, at the rate of eight or nine knots an hour,
  steering about east by south, under double-reefed topsails and
  reefed foresail. At eight o'clock in the evening the usual watch
  was placed, with directions to keep a careful look-out. The night
  was dark and squally, with a high sea running, and occasionally
  loud peals of thunder were heard, accompanied with vivid flashes
  of lightning.</p>

  <p>Most of the officers were collected in the gun-room, with the
  exception of the captain, who had retired to his sleeping cabin.
  He had directed his steward to request the attendance of the
  master, and of Mr. Betts, the second master, who soon joined him
  in the cabin, where they remained for a few minutes examining the
  charts. The captain's steward relates, that the above officers
  went <a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>upon deck, when Captain
  Napier desired him to take away the light, and to leave a small
  lamp burning in the fore-cabin, which was always kept alight at
  sea during the night. He accordingly did so, and returned to his
  berth. In about half-an-hour afterwards he heard some one come
  down from the quarter-deck, and go into the captain's cabin. In
  about five minutes the captain went upon deck, where he remained
  for a short time, and again returned to his cabin, but had
  scarcely closed the door, before he was summoned upon deck by the
  officer of the watch.</p>

  <p>The officers in the gun-room were upon the point of retiring
  to their berths, when they were startled by a sudden jerk, which
  they at first supposed to be a gun broken adrift, but the next
  moment the ship gave a heavy lurch, as if filling, and her whole
  frame appeared shaken, and every beam loosened. It would be in
  vain to attempt to describe the dismay of the crew of the
  ill-fated Avenger, when thus roused from a sense of comparative
  security, to find themselves in an instant upon the verge of
  destruction. Already the deck was crowded with people, most of
  them only partially clothed, and the rest almost naked. On the
  bridge between the paddle-boxes stood the captain and master; Mr.
  Ayling, the master's assistant, the quarter-master, and two
  seamen were at the wheel. In another minute the ship gave a heavy
  lurch to starboard, and the sea poured over the forecastle. The
  captain then gave the order, 'Out boats&mdash;lower away the
  boats.' These were his last words, for he was immediately
  afterwards washed overboard and drowned.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Rooke, who never appears to have lost his presence
  of mind, immediately went forward to assist in lowering the
  boats, but under the firm impression that <a name="Page_300" id=
  "Page_300"></a>the ship was fast sinking, and with little hope
  that there was time enough to get out the boats, or even if
  lowered, that they could live in such a heavy sea. He saw,
  however, if anything was to be done, it must be done immediately;
  he therefore went amongst the men endeavouring to persuade them
  to lower the starboard cutter; Mr. Betts, the second master, at
  the same time attempted to lower the port one. Every entreaty and
  persuasion that Lieutenant Rooke could use was, however, of no
  avail; the men seemed paralysed with the sudden panic and the
  apparent helplessness of their situation. Instead of affording
  assistance, they clustered together, exclaiming, 'Oh, my God,
  Sir, we are lost&mdash;we are lost!' Mr. Rooke, finding that all
  his arguments were of no avail, crossed the deck to the port side
  for the purpose of helping Mr. Betts in lowering the port cutter.
  In his way he met Larcom, the gunner, who had just come from
  below, with his clothes under his arm, having been in bed when
  the ship struck. Hastily acquainting him with his intention, they
  made the best of their way to the cutter, where they were joined
  by Dr. Steel, the surgeon, Mr. Ayling, master's-assistant, John
  Owen, a stoker, James Morley, a boy, and W. Hills, captain's
  steward. At this moment, Lieutenant Marryat made his appearance,
  his manner calm and self-possessed; he was in the act of
  addressing himself to one of the party, when the ship gave a
  heavy lurch to starboard, and the gallant young officer lost his
  footing, and was washed overboard.</p>

  <p>Whilst they were in the act of lowering the cutter, an
  accident occurred, which was nearly proving fatal to all their
  hopes of preservation.</p>

  <p>In lowering the boat, the foremost fall got jammed, and the
  after one going freely, the boat had her stern in the water, and
  her bows in the air; at this moment, Dr. <a name="Page_301" id=
  "Page_301"></a>Steel threw in his cloak, which fortunately got
  into the sleave-hole of the after fall, and stopped it.</p>

  <p>Just as the boat touched the water, and before the tackles
  were unhooked, the ship struck again heavily, and began swinging
  broadside to the sea, falling over to starboard at the same time,
  which, from the cutter being the port one, made her crash with
  great violence against the ship's side; however, by dint of great
  exertion, the boat was got free from the tackles, and pulled
  clear of the ship.</p>

  <p>The Avenger now lay broadside to the sea, with her head
  towards Africa, falling at the same time to windward, with her
  deck exposed; the foremast, mainmast, and mizen topmast falling
  over the starboard side, and the funnel on the gangway, no doubt
  killing many of the crew as it fell. As the boat left the ship's
  side, some one attempted to burn a blue-light, but it went out
  immediately. The sea was now occasionally seen to break over the
  forecastle and quarter, and Mr. Rooke, in the hope of saving some
  of the crew, gave orders to lie on their oars, and keep the
  boat's bow to the ship, to be ready to pick up any of the
  survivors in the event of the ship's falling to pieces.
  Lieutenant Rooke and his little party<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id=
  "FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class=
  "fnanchor">[19]</a> remained by the ship for about an hour and a
  half, the moon at intervals shining out brightly from behind the
  heavy clouds, and discovering the Island of Galita, apparently at
  about ten or twelve miles distant. The weather now became more
  tempestuous; the rain poured in torrents; and all being almost
  exhausted with pulling against a strong current, and being
  gradually drawn <a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>away from
  the ship, Lieutenant Rooke considered it most advisable to run
  under the lee of Galita, and there, if possible, remain on their
  oars until there was daylight sufficient to land, and seek
  assistance for the ship, in the event of the island being
  inhabited.</p>

  <p>All being of the same opinion, the boat's head was turned
  towards Galita, and they took a last look of the Avenger, which
  appeared to be firmly fixed, and likely to hold together for some
  time.</p>

  <p>The weather grew worse and worse; the boat, under a
  close-reefed mizen on the bumpkin stepped as a foremast, was
  steered with an oar by the second master. When they had arrived
  within about two miles of the island, the wind shifted to a very
  severe squall, accompanied with lightning, thunder, and a heavy
  hail-storm. Mr. Larcom, the gunner, now took the place of the
  second master in steering the boat, which was scarcely got round,
  before the wind caught her with such violence, that it seemed
  impossible the boat could live.</p>

  <p>The squall continued without intermission for two hours and a
  half, when the moon again emerged from the clouds, and the Island
  of Galita was discovered on the port quarter. Some in the boat
  exclaimed, 'That is the island!' which, at the time, they
  supposed to be long out of sight, as the boat appeared to be
  going rapidly through the water; this naturally led to a
  conjecture that a strong current set to the northward and
  eastward. The wind still continued to veer about, and at one time
  they thought that they must have passed the ship, but the night
  was too dark to enable them to discern anything clearly many
  yards beyond the boat.</p>

  <p>In this manner they passed the long hours of night, exposed to
  cold, hunger, and exhaustion; and, as Lieutenant Rooke afterwards
  observed, with the full expecta<a name="Page_303" id=
  "Page_303"></a>tion that they would be unable to survive until
  morning. The second master appeared to have lost all reason. Upon
  being questioned as to whereabouts they were, or in what
  direction it was necessary to steer, he seemed to be scarcely
  aware that he was addressed. The doctor, the master's assistant,
  and the boy Morley, were lying at the bottom of the boat during
  the whole night, and the stoker, John Owen, was wrapped in his
  jacket, and appeared, if possible, in a worse condition than the
  second master. When asked to do anything, he only replied by
  vacant answers, and before morning became an idiot. At last the
  wished-for day broke, and the coast of Africa was discerned about
  eight or nine miles distant. As Lieutenant Rooke considered that
  the boat could not be kept above water much longer, he determined
  upon attempting a landing, and accordingly he himself steered her
  towards a small spot of sand, apparently clear of the rocks, and
  slightly sheltered by a reef running out into the sea.</p>

  <p>This officer, from the time the boat quitted the Avenger, had,
  notwithstanding his own personal sufferings, set a noble example
  to his comrades, by exerting every effort to sustain their
  drooping spirits. As he approached the shore, he exclaimed in a
  cheerful voice, 'This is something like Don Juan's shipwreck; I
  only hope we shall find a Haidee.' It must not be supposed that
  this was said out of bravado, or because he was not perfectly
  aware of the danger, but from the necessity of his duty, as their
  commanding officer, to infuse a new spirit into his exhausted
  crew, and to encourage them in the approaching struggle, which he
  well knew would he 'life or death.' On hearing the above words,
  poor Steel, the doctor, exclaimed, 'Rooke! Rooke! there are other
  things to think of now.' The words were prophetic, for <a name=
  "Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>before many minutes had elapsed, he
  had ceased to exist. As they approached the shore, the sail was
  shifted from the port side to the starboard, and the sheet which
  had been held by Hills, the captain's steward, for ten hours, was
  fastened to the thwarts.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rooke now again resigned his place as steerer to Larcom,
  the gunner, and assisted the others in baling out the boat, which
  had shipped a heavy sea on the quarter. The boat was steered
  within about one hundred and fifty yards of the beach, when the
  rollers caught her, first lifting her upright, and, as there was
  not water enough to float her whole length, she filled and
  capsized. Larcom, Lieutenant Rooke, Hills, the captain's steward,
  and the boy Morley, succeeded in gaining the beach, but the rest
  of their unfortunate comrades perished.</p>

  <p>We should here mention that this was the second occasion on
  which the boy Morley narrowly escaped a watery grave.</p>

  <p>When the Avenger was at Lisbon, the boy fell overboard, and
  would have perished, had it not been for Lieutenant Marryat, who,
  at the risk of his own life, sprung into the sea, and rescued the
  boy.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes a Bedouin Arab, who had been watching the
  boat from some high ground, came toward them and conducted them
  to his hut, where he supplied them with some milk; and having
  lighted a fire, they were enabled to dry their clothes.</p>

  <p>They remained with their hospitable entertainer during that
  day, and in the evening made a supper of maize-cake and sour
  milk. In the meantime, Mr. Rooke had made the Arab understand
  their situation, and their wish to get to Tunis; and after some
  trouble and promise of reward, he agreed to conduct them next
  morning to Biserta. The wearied men then threw <a name="Page_305"
  id="Page_305"></a>themselves on the ground, where they passed the
  night in company with dogs, cows, and goats, exposed to a violent
  wind and pouring rain.</p>

  <p>Their subsequent proceedings are thus related by Lieutenant
  Rooke:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Wednesday, December 22nd.&mdash;At about 9 A.M. we started.
  Our road lay at first over a ridge of high hills, from which we
  saw nothing of the ship. We then crossed a sandy plain covered
  with the cactus, which severely wounded my feet. Afterwards
  passed through some wooded ravines, and over an extensive marsh
  intersected with brooks. Towards the evening a horseman overtook
  us, who seeing the tired condition of the steward, his feet
  bleeding, and also suffering from a gash on his head, received
  whilst landing, carried him for about four miles, and when his
  road lay in a different direction, gave our guide his gun, and a
  piece of silver for us.</p>

  <p>'The night being now dark, and all of us exhausted, we stopped
  at a Bedouin encampment, and asked for shelter, which after some
  time was granted. We had been walking about ten hours, and got
  over more than thirty miles of broken ground, having stopped once
  for a few minutes to pick the berries off some arbutus trees,
  being our only food since breakfast till late that night. We were
  wet, coverless, and all except myself shoeless.</p>

  <p>'They gave us some maize-cake and milk. Seeing horses, I made
  them understand that they would be well paid if they let us have
  them to take us on to Biserta that night, when they made signs
  that the gates were locked, but that we should have them in the
  morning.</p>

  <p>'Thursday, December 23rd.&mdash;At daylight we set out, but
  none of us could walk from swollen feet. After a <a name=
  "Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>ride of about fifteen miles,
  sometimes fording streams, and at others nearly up to our horses'
  knees in mud, we arrived about ten A.M., at Biserta, and went to
  the house of our consular agent, an Italian, whom I immediately
  asked to prepare a boat for Tunis.</p>

  <p>'The boats here were all too small to send to the wreck, and
  for which the wind was foul, with a fresh breeze. About 1 P.M. I
  started for Tunis, and arrived about 11 P.M. at the Goletta,
  where I landed, and sent to our Vice-Consul, who after some
  difficulty, owing to the port regulations, came to see me, and
  tried to pass me through the gates, but did not succeed. He
  promised to get two vessels ready, as unfortunately there were no
  steamers here at the time of our arrival. In one I meant to have
  sent Mr. Larcom to Galita, and the other I intended to take to
  the wreck.</p>

  <p>'Friday, December 24th.&mdash;At daylight, when the gates
  opened, I entered a carriage, and drove up to our consul-general,
  who ordered his agent to forward my views in every way, sending
  his son to hurry matters, whilst he communicated with the Bey,
  who ordered his squadron to sea.</p>

  <p>'Whilst my boat was preparing (a Maltese speronara, with a
  crew of twelve men, selected for their knowledge of the coast,) I
  wrote two letters, one to Malta, and the other to Lisbon, stating
  the loss of the ship. Not having slept for four nights, and being
  thoroughly tired, would account for the vague statement I sent. I
  then breakfasted, and started about two P.M., having put on board
  such provisions as my hurried departure admitted of&mdash;tea,
  coffee, biscuits, and spirits, in case I should be fortunate
  enough to save anybody.</p>

  <p>'Saturday, December 25th, on my passage, and at daylight on
  Sunday I was close to the spot where the <a name="Page_307" id=
  "Page_307"></a>Avenger was wrecked, although there was no broken
  or discoloured water to mark it. I cruised about till satisfied
  she had either broken up or sunk. Whilst here I saw two steamers
  (Lavoisier and Pasha) come up and cruise about Galita together: a
  merchant ship, and a gun-boat of the Bey's, with which I
  communicated, asking them to take me to Galita, which I wished to
  examine personally, as also to speak the steamers, my own crew,
  with whom I had great trouble, refusing to do so. They declined,
  when I asked them to take half my crew out, and lend me two men,
  to which request I also received a negative; so I returned to
  Tunis, arriving at about 1 A.M. on the morning of Tuesday,
  December 28th. Sir Thomas Reade took all to his house, and made
  it a home for us. I went on board the French steamer Lavoisier,
  to thank the captain for his assistance, and also waited on the
  governor for the same purpose.'</p>

  <p>During the summer of the present year, the French government
  directed Captain Bouchet Rivi&egrave;re to make a survey of the
  Sorelle. In conclusion, therefore, we will give the following
  extract from that officer's letter, as it throws some light upon
  the circumstances which led to the loss of the
  Avenger:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'The English frigate, Avenger, was lost on the two Sorelle; I
  saw between the two heads of rocks, which are aptly named
  'Sisters,' her entire engine, two anchors, a shell gun, and some
  loose parts of the wreck. I recovered and took on board some
  pieces of iron from the bed of the engine, and a boarding
  cutlass. The engine lies in a medium depth of ten metres
  (thirty-three feet).</p>

  <p>'From information which has been given me by boats which saw
  the Avenger at sea the day of her loss, and adding the
  observations which I was enabled to make <a name="Page_308" id=
  "Page_308"></a>on the spot itself, I have every reason to believe
  that the event happened in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'The Avenger had, during the day, run along the coast of
  Algeria, but on the approach of night, being then north of Calle,
  and the weather having suddenly become very bad, with a great
  deal of wind from the north-west, the captain of the Avenger
  altered her course immediately to the northward, in order not to
  be caught in the middle of a dangerous channel. As soon as he
  thought that the ship had passed the parallel of the Sorelle, he
  resumed his course to the eastward, satisfied that he would pass
  several miles to the northward of them. He had not calculated on
  the currents which I have found at this dangerous spot, and
  which, with a north-west wind, set to the south-eastward with a
  rapidity of about 3 miles an hour. The track of the Avenger must
  have been materially altered by this cause. When she steered
  east, she was only in the latitude of the Sorelle, and was
  shortly afterwards, on a very dark night, shattered against these
  rocks. The first shock must have been dreadful. It took place on
  the point south-east of the north-west rock; when she cleared
  this rock, which is at this spot thirteen feet below the surface,
  leaving a large white furrow, she ran a hundred and sixty feet
  further, and struck on the south-east rock, which is only about
  four feet (one metre twenty centimetres) below the surface. She
  again marked the rock very distinctly. The sea, which is often
  very rough on this spot, has left nothing remaining but the
  massive part of the engine, where it can be perceived between the
  two rocks, covered with thick weed.</p>

  <p>'The dangerous Sorelle are formed by two tables of rocks,
  distant about a hundred and sixty feet from each other, and
  separated by a channel of a medium depth of thirty-nine to
  forty-nine feet (twelve to fifteen metres). <a name="Page_309"
  id="Page_309"></a>These two tables of rocks extend from the
  north-west to the south-east. The north-west one has a diameter
  of 66 English feet (twenty metres), its highest point is to the
  eastward, 16 feet under water (five metres). The southeastern has
  a diameter of 197 feet (sixty metres), and its highest point is
  only at a depth of 4 feet. This last point is situated, according
  to my observations, which agree with the position laid down in
  the chart of Admiral Berard, in 37&deg; 24' of north latitude,
  and 6&deg; 16' 25" of east longitude from Paris, (or 8&deg; 36'
  45" east of Greenwich); 17'.4 miles S. 65&deg; 15' W. of the east
  point of the Island of Galita, and 27'.3 miles N. 0&deg; 30' E.
  of Cape Roux.'</p>

  <p>The fate of the Avenger leads to many sad reflections. The
  last of the wrecks described in this volume, one of yesterday, as
  it were, was more disastrous than many others. It is painful to
  contemplate the scene of dismay, when the ship struck, so unlike
  the presence of mind and calm deportment which we have recorded
  on similar occasions. But every allowance is to be made for the
  panic which followed a catastrophe so sudden and so overwhelming.
  The night was dark and tempestuous, the sea was running high, and
  all the elements were in a state of uproar. The paralyzing effect
  of this accumulation of horrors appears in the fact, that even
  after the small party of eight had so far secured their
  preservation as to be in possession of the cutter, and were
  within sight of the Island of Galita, two of them were found to
  be bereft of their reason.</p>

  <p>The first crash, and the rapid plunge of the ship into the
  gulf that opened for her, and the loss of their captain among the
  first that perished, left the crew without that guidance and
  control to which seamen are in the habit of looking for
  support.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>But though we have to
  regret the consternation that prevailed, there was no gross
  neglect or misconduct to throw a darker shade over the last hours
  of the Avenger. Captain Napier had been in consultation in his
  cabin with the master and second-master, examining the charts,
  and had also been on deck, giving directions to the officer of
  the watch, but a short time before the first alarm. When the
  panic was at its height, there was no act of dastardly
  selfishness for personal preservation, to the disregard of the
  safety of others. The officers are not accused of losing their
  composure. Lieut. Marryat is stated to have been 'calm and
  self-possessed;' and Mr. Rooke's strenuous efforts to lower the
  cutter, and his manly resolution to remain by the ship, as long
  as there was any chance of saving the lives of some of the
  survivors, attest his devotion to his duty to the very last.</p>

  <p>The French officer, Captain Bouchier Rivi&egrave;re, who made
  a survey of the Sorelle after the wreck, and who deliberately
  considered all the circumstances, imputes no blame to the
  officers of the Avenger, but generously accounts for the
  misfortune by referring to the dangers of the spot, the force of
  the currents, the wildness of the weather, and the darkness of
  the night. 'The first shock,' says he, 'must have been
  dreadful.'</p>

  <p>It would have been humiliating and afflicting, had this record
  of the Shipwrecks of the Royal Navy, in which there is so much to
  admire, been closed with the details of a calamity in any way
  disgraceful to the service. Truth has required that the words
  '<i>dismay</i>' and '<i>panic</i>' should be used in the
  foregoing relation; but the terrible suddenness of the event, the
  instantaneous shock which broke up the Avenger in a moment,
  without the preparatory warning of 'breakers ahead,' or the
  previous notice of rocks or shoals in sight, will more than
  account <a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>for the helplessness
  to which the crew were reduced. They had not time to brace up
  their shattered nerves. The noble bearing of the two lieutenants,
  Rooke and Marryat, cool as they were, and in full command of
  their energies in the midst of crashing timbers and perishing
  men, places the character of the British seaman in its title
  light, and winds up our narrative with two more examples of naval
  heroism.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

<pre>
*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
