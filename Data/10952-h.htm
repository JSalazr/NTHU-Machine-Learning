<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>A memorial to SIMON DE MONTFORT has been unveiled at Evesham,
where he fell in 1265. A pathetic inquiry reaches us as to whether
SIMON is yet demobilised.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We are informed that the project of adding a "Silence Room" to
the National Liberal Club is to be resuscitated.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Small one piece houses of concrete," says <i>The National
News</i>, "are now quite common in America." The only complaint, it
appears, is that some of them are just a trifle tight under the
arms.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We hope that the proposed revival by a well-known theatre
manager of <i>The Sins of David</i> so shortly after the General
Election is not the work of a defeated Candidate.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Some of the discredited Radical organs," says a contemporary,
"are already toying with Bolshevism." A case of "<i>Soviet qui
peut</i>."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The report that a number of distinguished Irish Unionists have
been ordered to choose between the LORD-LIEUTENANT's Reconstruction
Committee and the O.B.E. is causing anxiety in Dublin Club
circles.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Weymouth Council has decided to change the name of Holstein
Avenue. We deprecate these attempts to force the Peace Conference's
hand.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. HENRY FORD's new paper is called <i>The Dearborn
Independent</i>. Most independent papers, it is noticed, are
that.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Why has the Government raised the price of new sharps?" asks
"FARMER" in <i>The Daily Mail</i>. They may cost more, but they
look to us like the same old sharps.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Sensation-mongering" is the public's verdict on the startling
report circulated last week that a Civil Servant had been seen
running.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The National Potato Exhibition, it is announced, will in future
be held at Birmingham. The League of Political Small Potatoes, on
the other hand, has moved its permanent headquarters to
Manchester.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There were 21,457 fewer paupers in London last week compared
with the same period in 1915, it is stated. All we can say is, it
isn't London's fault.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A correspondent, writing to a contemporary, thinks it should be
illegal for one taxi-driver to talk to another in the streets. It
would be interesting under these circumstances to see what happened
if two rival cabs collided.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>With reference to the Upper Norwood gentleman who is reported to
have arrived home early one night last week, it is not true that he
travelled by tube. He walked.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>One thing after another. No sooner is influenza on the wane than
we read of a serious outbreak of Jazz music in London.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We gather from the interviews appearing in the papers that Mr.
PHILIP SNOWDEN is of the opinion that his defeat was due to the
General Election.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We are asked to deny the rumour that the KAISER has offered to
compete for <i>The Daily Mail</i> trans-Atlantic flight and has
offered to forgo the prize.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Scientists are agreed, says <i>Tit-Bits</i>, that there is
nothing to prevent people living for five hundred or even one
thousand years. We feel, however, that in the case of certain very
objectionable persons exemption might be given at the age of about
forty years.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Blwyddyn Newydd Dda i bawb Ohonynt" was the reported greeting
sent by Mr. LLOYD GEORGE to his election agent. Other delegates to
the Peace Conference are talking in the same truculent strain.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>One of the men for whom our heart goes out in sympathy is a
South Carolina farmer who has been in the habit of doctoring
himself with the help of a medical book. When only fifty-five years
of age he died of a misprint.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A prisoner charged at London Sessions with stealing was
described as "one of a most daring and clever gang of thieves." It
is said that he has asked counsel for permission to use this
excellent testimonial on his note-headings.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An Irish farmer aged one hundred-and-four years, who took a
prominent part in the General Election, has just died. This should
be a lesson to people who meddle with politics.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The current open secret in Society," says <i>The Star</i>, "is
the engagement of Lady DIANA MANNERS, but when it will be announced
only she herself will decide." This is extraordinary. A few weeks
ago the decision would have rested with the newspapers.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There were 523 fewer books published last year than in the year
before. This, we understand, is explained by the fact that Mr.
CHARLES GARVICE and Mr. E. PHILLIPS OPPENHEIM each went to the
theatre one night in the early autumn.</p>

<h2>THE RHYME OF THE "RIO GRANDE."</h2>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>By Salthouse Dock as I did pass one day not long ago,</p>
<p>I chanced to meet a sailorman that once I used to know;</p>
<p>His eye it had a roving gleam, his step was light and gay,</p>
<p>He looked like one just in from sea to blow a nine months'
pay;</p>
<p>And as he passed athwart my hawse he hailed me long and
loud:</p>
<p>"Oh, find me now a full saloon where I may stand the crowd;</p>
<p>I'm out to rouse the town this night as any man may be</p>
<p>That's just come off a salvage job, my lad, the same as
me....</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i>, her as used to
be</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Crack o' Moore</i>, Mackellar's Line, back in
ninety-three;</p>
<p class="i2">First of all the 'Frisco fleet, home in
ninety-eight,</p>
<p class="i2">Ninety days to Carrick Roads from the Golden
Gate;</p>
<p class="i2">Thirty shellbacks used to have all their work to
do</p>
<p class="i2">Hauling them big yards of hers, heaving of her to</p>
<p class="i2">Down off Dago Ramirez, where the big winds blow,</p>
<p class="i2">Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> twenty years
ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"We picked her up one morning homeward bound from Portland,
Maine,</p>
<p>In a nine-knot grunting cargo tramp, by name the <i>Crown o'
Spain</i>;</p>
<p>The day was breaking cold and dark and dirty as could be,</p>
<p>It was blowin' up for weather as we couldn't help but see.</p>
<p>Her crew was gone the Lord knows where&mdash;and Fritz had left
her too;</p>
<p>He must have took a scare and quit afore his job was
through;</p>
<p>We tried to pass a hawser, but it warn't no kind o' good,</p>
<p>So we put a salvage crew aboard to save her if we could....</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> and her freight
as well,</p>
<p class="i2">Half-a-score of steamboatmen cursin' her like
hell,</p>
<p class="i2">Flounderin' in the flooded waist, scramblin' for a
hold,</p>
<p class="i2">Hangin' on by teeth and toes, dippin' when she
rolled;</p>
<p class="i2">Ginger Dan the donkeyman, Joe the 'doctor's'
mate,</p>
<p class="i2">Lumpers off the water-front, greasers from the
Plate,</p>
<p class="i2">That's the sort o' crowd we had to reef and steer and
haul,</p>
<p class="i2">Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i>&mdash;ship and
freight and all.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Our mate had served his time in sail, he was a bully boy,</p>
<p>It'd wake a corpse to hear him hail 'Foretopsail yard ahoy!'</p>
<p>He knew the ways o' squaresail and he knew the way to swear,</p>
<p>He'd got the habit of it here and there and everywhere;</p>
<p>He'd some samples from the Baltic and some more from
Mozambique;</p>
<p>Chinook and Chink and double-Dutch and Mexican and Greek;</p>
<p>He'd a word or two in Russian, but he learned the best he'd
got</p>
<p>Off a pious preachin' skipper&mdash;and he had to use the
lot....</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> in a seven-days'
gale,</p>
<p class="i2">Seven days and seven nights, the same as JONAH'S
whale,</p>
<p class="i2">Standard compass gone to bits, steering all
adrift,</p>
<p class="i2">Courses split and mainmast sprung, cargo on the shift
...</p>
<p class="i2">Not a chart in all the ship left to steer her by,</p>
<p class="i2">Not a glimpse of star or sun in the bloomin' sky
...</p>
<p class="i2">Two men at the jury wheel, kickin' like a mule,</p>
<p class="i2">Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> up to
Liverpool.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The seventh day off South Stack Light the sun began to
shine;</p>
<p>Up come an Admiralty tug and offered us a line;</p>
<p>The mate he took the megaphone and leaned across the rail,</p>
<p>And this or something like it was the answer to her hail:</p>
<p>He'd take it very kindly if they'd tell us where we were,</p>
<p>And he hoped the War was going well, he'd got a brother
there,</p>
<p>And he'd thought about their offer and he thanked them kindly
too,</p>
<p>But since we'd brought her up so far, by God we'd see it
through....</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> (and we done it
too),</p>
<p class="i2">Courses split and mainmast sprung&mdash;half a watch
for crew&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> and her freight
as well,</p>
<p class="i2">Half-a-score of steamboatmen cursing her like
hell&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Her as led the grain fleet home back in
ninety-eight,</p>
<p class="i2">Ninety days to Carrick Roads from the Golden
Gate&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Half-a-score of steamboatmen to steer and reef and
haul,</p>
<p class="i2">Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i>&mdash;ship and
freight and all."</p>

<h2>HELPFUL HOME HINTS</h2>
<h4>(<i>With acknowledgments to the Weekly Papers</i>).</h4>
<p>To keep moth from a haggis, sprinkle well with prussic acid or
cayenne pepper. Repeat three times daily. (This method has never
been known to fail.)</p>
<p>An excellent germicide for wire-worm can be made with two parts
carbolic acid and three parts castor-oil. Rub over the wire-worm
with a soft rag and polish with a clean duster.</p>
<p>To remove dust from whiskers, soak whiskers in paraffin or
petrol for half-an-hour and singe gently with lighted taper.</p>
<p>To clean a carpet, take a small wet tea-leaf and roll it well
over the carpet. Then remove the tea-leaf and store in a dry place.
Take the carpet to the cleaners and you will be surprised at the
result.</p>
<p>An excellent trousers press can be made in the following manner:
Get the local monumental mason to supply you with two slabs of
granite measuring about six feet by two feet and weighing about
seven hundredweight each. Place the trousers on top of one block of
granite, place the other block on top of the trousers and secure
with a couple of book-straps. Finish off with blue
ribbon.&mdash;AUNT SADIE.</p>

<h2>THE NECROMANCERS.</h2>
<p>The other day, while I was out for a ride, I happened to run up
against my two Chinese acquaintances, Ah Sin and Dam Li, and I
stopped to have a chat with them. After the usual greetings Dam Li
remarked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Hon'lable officer lookee too muchee sad."</p>
<p>"Allee same like littlee dog when 'nother big dog stealum bone,"
supplemented Ah Sin.</p>
<p>"I wasn't aware of it," I said shortly, a little hurt at the
comparison.</p>
<p>"P'haps hon'lable officer losee lations allee same little dog,"
suggested Dam Li.</p>
<p>"Well," I admitted, "I <i>have</i> lost something&mdash;at least
the Mess has. Only it isn't rations; it's a milk-jug."</p>
<p>This, our only article of plate, was a battered piece of
treasure-trove salved from the ruins of a derelict village.</p>
<p>Dam Li was all sympathy.</p>
<p>"You talkee China boy. Him findum one time plenty quick," he
announced confidently.</p>
<p>"All right," I said; "only you won't get anything just for
trying, mind. You'll have to succeed."</p>
<p>"China boy no wantchee nothing," replied Dam Li
reproachfully.</p>
<p>"Him only wantchee officer smile allee same like dog waggee tail
when lations come back," added Ah Sin by way of embroidery.</p>
<p>"Thank you," I said gravely. "And when do you propose to start
replacing my smile?"</p>
<p>Apparently there was no time like the present, so back we went
to the Mess and they set to work. Their opening move was somewhat
startling, even to me who knew them of old.</p>
<p>"Giveum China boy one piecee blead," commanded Dam Li.</p>
<p>"What for?" I demurred.</p>
<p>"China Boy eatum blead and talkee plenty good player [prayer],"
said Ah Sin. "Then thief-man too muchee flighten' an' giveum back
jug plenty dam quick."</p>
<p>"But why should he be afraid?" I asked.</p>
<p>Ah Sin was very patient with me.</p>
<p>"Players plenty stlong language talkee," he said. "S'pose
thief-man not giveum back jug, belly get plenty too muchee fat
..."</p>
<p>"An' go bang allee same air-dlagon bomb," broke in Dam Li,
rubbing his hands together at the prospect.</p>
<p>"Very well, you may have your loaf," said I, capitulating; and
then rashly I added, "Is there anything else you'd like?"</p>
<p>"Beer makee players plenty much worser for thief-man," said Ah
Sin ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>In the end I produced the beer as well as the bread and the
incantations commenced. They consisted in getting outside my bread
and beer, and in filling the intervals between mouthfuls with a
copious barrage of Chinese, occasional prostrations and a
considerable amount of laughter. This last aroused my suspicions
and I asked what it meant.</p>
<p>"Thief-man keepee plenty big pain here," explained Dam Li,
indicating the region to which the bread and beer had by now all
descended. "Him topside mad this minute."</p>
<p>"Giveum back jug to-mollow," prophesied Ah Sin. "China boy come
an' see," he added as he got up to go.</p>
<p>The morrow arrived and so did the Chinamen, but not the
milk-jug. This seemed to cause Ah Sin and Dam Li the greatest
surprise.</p>
<p>"Thief-man No. 1 stlong man," asserted the former.</p>
<p>"Wantchee extla double-lation players," agreed his
companion.</p>
<p>"Hon'lable officer giveum China boy 'nother piece blead,"
suggested Ah Sin.</p>
<p>"An' baer," added Dam Li hastily.</p>
<p>Nosing an obvious conspiracy I at first refused. However I at
length gave way on the understanding that there was on no account
to be a third imposition. The rites of the day before were
thereupon repeated.</p>
<p>When they were over Dam Li suddenly professed himself to be
inspired.</p>
<p>"China boy seeum jug," he announced.</p>
<p>"Where?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Seeum box, plenty too muchee big," Dam Li went on in sepulchral
tones; "jug inside box."</p>
<p>Ah Sin now joined in.</p>
<p>"Where isum box?" he asked excitedly.</p>
<p>"No savvy," replied Dam Li, shaking his head.</p>
<p>Ah Sin gazed wildly around. Seeing a box in the distance he
rushed at it. Dam Li waved him back.</p>
<p>"That box no dam use," he stated.</p>
<p>Ah Sin tried again.</p>
<p>"P'haps him in dirty box," he suggested.</p>
<p>Dam Li rolled his eyes inwards, as one who consulted an oracle
within.</p>
<p>"Jug inside dirty box," he agreed ultimately, pointing in its
direction.</p>
<p>"Oh, in the dust-bin," I said. "Well, there's no harm in
looking."</p>
<p>So look we did, and there, sure enough, it was. I picked it out
and did some quick thinking.</p>
<p>"Now, when did you two ruffians put it there?" I asked
sternly.</p>
<p>"Thief-man put it there," protested Dam Li, with a magnificent
look of injured innocence.</p>
<p>"I know," said I. "Come on, now, tell me why you stole it, and,
as you've brought it back again, I <i>may</i> let you off."</p>
<p>"China boy's lations too muchee few, him plenty hungly," said Ah
Sin, seeing that the game was up.</p>
<p>"S'pose him sellum jug, buy plenty beer," confided Dam Li
unblushingly.</p>
<p>"But hon'lable officer lookee too muchee sad, so China boy dam
solly. Fetchee back jug," resumed Ah Sin.</p>
<p>As I had often gone out of my way to do the pair a good turn I
was naturally pained at their ingratitude. Taking the jug, I turned
away in silence and left them. Ah Sin pursued me.</p>
<p>"Hon'lable officer likee jug?" he asked.</p>
<p>Dam Li, who had followed, answered for me.</p>
<p>"Likee jug allee same China boy likee lations," he

<h2>MORE REPRISALS.</h2>
<p>That ass Ellis is a poor creature, and, like the poor, he is
always with me. I think he is a punishment inflicted upon me for
some past error.</p>
<p>A short time ago I caught the "flu." Naturally the first person
I suspected was Ellis, but I am bound to confess that I have not
been able to prove it. Indeed, when he followed me to hospital two
days later and was put in the next bed, I felt justified in
exonerating him altogether.</p>
<p>The first remark that he made, when he reached that stage of the
complaint where you feel like making remarks, illustrates just the
kind of man he is. He accused <i>me</i> of giving the thing to
<i>him</i>!</p>
<p>I answered his outburst with the scorn it deserved.</p>
<p>"Preposterous," I said.</p>
<p>I added a few apposite remarks, to which he responded as best he
could. But, medically speaking, I was two days senior to him, so
that when the Sister heard the uproar and bustled up it was he who
was forbidden to speak. She then proceeded to clinch the matter by
inserting a thermometer in his mouth. I defy any man to argue under
such a handicap.</p>
<p>I finished all I had to say and relapsed into an expectant
silence. The Sister returned after a time, read the instrument and
retired without a word. As she passed my bed I saw out of the
corner of my eye that Ellis was watching feverishly. An inspiration
seized me. I stopped her, and in a low voice asked if she had fed
her rabbits. Sister isn't allowed to keep rabbits, but she does. As
I hoped, she put a finger to her lips, nodded and walked away.</p>
<p>"Poor old man," I murmured vaguely to the ward in general. "A
hundred-and-seven and still rising! Poor old Ellis!"</p>
<p>Ellis gave a little moan and collapsed under the bedclothes.</p>
<p>An hour later Burnett went his round. Burnett isn't the doctor,
at least not the official one. I must tell you something about
Burnett.</p>
<p>He is the grandfather of the ward. Though quite a young man he
has grown fat through long lying in bed. He entered hospital, I
understand, towards the end of 1914, suffering from influenza.
Since then he has had a nibble at every imaginable disease, not to
mention a number of imaginary ones as well. Regularly four times a
day he would waddle round the ward in his dingy old dressing-gown,
discussing symptoms with every cot. In exchange for your helping of
pudding he would take your temperature and let you know the answer,
and for a bunch of grapes he would tell you the probable course of
your complaint and the odds against complete recovery. No one
seemed to interfere with him. You see, Burnett was no longer a
case; he was an institution.</p>
<p>He spent a long time by Ellis's bedside. I suspect Ellis wasn't
feeling much like pudding at the moment. I couldn't hear very well
what was going on, but Ellis was chattering as only Ellis can, and
the comfortable Burnett was apparently soothing him with an
occasional "All right, old man. I'll see what I can do for
you."</p>
<p>At length the grapes were all consumed and the huge form of
Burnett loomed above me.</p>
<p>"Why, Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;," said the soothing voice, "I don't
want to alarm you, but really&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Really what?" I cried, starting up in bed at the gravity of his
tone.</p>
<p>"Well, you know&mdash;your colour; I perhaps&mdash;"</p>
<p>He fumbled in the folds of his voluminous gown and produced a
small metal mirror. Then he seemed to change his mind and put it
back again.</p>
<p>"I'd better not," he said softly to himself, and then louder to
me, "Have you got a wife&mdash;or perhaps a mother?"</p>
<p>I am no coward, but I confess I was trembling by this time.</p>
<p>"Why?" I cried. "Do you think I ought to send for them?"</p>
<p>"Send for them?" he echoed. "<i>Send for them?</i> And you in
the grip of C.S.M.! It would be sheer madness&mdash;murder!"</p>
<p>The cold sweat stood out upon my brow but I kept my head.</p>
<p>"Have an apple, won't you, Mr. Burnett?"</p>
<p>He selected the largest and began to munch it in
silence&mdash;silence, that is, as far as talking was
concerned.</p>
<p>"Tell me," I stammered; "wh&mdash;what is C.S.M.? And may I have
a look at myself?"</p>
<p>He cogitated. "Shall I?" he muttered. "Yes, I think he ought to
know." Then quite quietly, accompanied by the core of the apple,
there fell from his lips the fatal words "Cerebro-spinal
meningitis."</p>
<p>At the same time he handed me the glass and selected the next
best apple.</p>
<p>I looked at myself. My hair stood straight on end; my face was
whitish-yellow, my eyes blazed with unmistakable fever. A
three-days' beard enhanced the horrible effect.</p>
<p>"Have you any pain&mdash;there?" One of his large soft hands
gripped my side and pinched it hard, the other selected the third
best apple.</p>
<p>"Yes," I groaned, "I <i>had</i> pain there."</p>
<p>"Ah!" he shook his head. "And there?" He sat down heavily on my
right ankle. He is a ponderous man.</p>
<p>"Agony," I moaned.</p>
<p>"Ah! And something throbbing like a gong in the brain?" he
inquired, tapping me on the head with the metal mirror.</p>
<p>I nodded dumbly. He rose, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>"All the symptoms, I'm afraid. That's just how it took poor old
Simpson. He had this very cot&mdash;let me see, back in '16, I
suppose. I had it very slightly afterwards&mdash;it was touch and
go; I was the only one they pulled through&mdash;but I only had it
<i>very</i> slightly, you understand&mdash;not like that. But cheer
up, old man. I've been told that a fellow got through it in the
next ward&mdash;of course he's an idiot now, but he didn't
<i>die</i>. I don't suppose you'll be wanting the rest of these
apples, will you? All right, don't mention it;" and he passed on to
the next cot.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg
39]</span>
<p>When the proper doctor came round a few minutes later (Burnett
says) he found his own thermometer quite inadequate and had to
borrow the one that registers the heat of the ward. When he took it
out of my mouth it wasn't far short of boiling-point, and he wrote
straight off to <i>The Lancet</i> about it; also they had to get
one of those lightning calculator chaps down to count my pulse.</p>
<p>Long before I came to, Ellis had been discharged, the ward had
filled up with fresh cases (except Burnett, of course), and the
armistice had been signed.</p>
<p>When I was well enough they handed me a letter which Ellis had
left for me.</p>
<p>"DEAR L&mdash;&mdash;" (it ran),&mdash;"Yes, the rabbits have
had their food. The biggest of them swallowed it all most
satisfactorily.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER HEATHEN CHINEE.</h2>
<p>We were discussing "slim" practices and the prevalence of the
basic desire to get something for nothing.</p>
<p>"If honesty," said one of the company, "is truly the best
policy, then there is a surfeit of the worst politician."</p>
<p>"Yes," said another, "and not only in the West. I assure you,
speaking as the director of an insurance concern in Shanghai, that
you have no monopoly in inventive chicanery. Insurance people must
always be on their guard, but never more so than among the
guileless Celestials. I can give you a case in point. Not long ago
we received a visit from the wife of one of our policy-holders,
saying that her husband was dead and claiming the money.</p>
<p>"'Certainly,' we said, 'the payment will be made, but only after
the usual investigations,' and sent her back to her village. It is
not that we were more suspicious of her than of anyone else, but
such formalities are essential. In this case they turned out to be
peculiarly necessary, for her husband was no more dead than you
are.</p>
<p>"When she got back to him and explained that there is always 'a
catch somewhere' in the insurance business, he took alarm. A
prosecution might be awkward, and at any cost must be evaded. He
therefore played a masterly card by writing the company a personal
letter of explanation, which he pretended was despatched before his
wife's return. The original is in Chinese, but I have an English
translation in my pocket-book."</p>
<p>The pursuit of odd examples of the epistolary art being one of
the principal occupations of my life, I secured a copy of the
document, which in English runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>To the &mdash;&mdash; Insurance Company</i>,
<i>Shanghai</i>.</p>
<p>"DEAR SIR,&mdash;When I died of a disease that came on suddenly
an intelligent doctor was at once asked for. He forced some fluid
into my mouth and made some injection on my body. He thus succeeded
in bringing me to life again.</p>
<p>"The beneficiary came to your place yesterday. What did she say?
Everything will be discussed after her return.</p>
<p>"Kindly give me your valuable assistance and reply by post.</p>
<p>"Yours faithfully, TSIN KOH."</p>

<h2>JOSHUA.</h2>
<p>On July 1st, 1916, the regiment, in company with several other
regiments and sundry pieces of ordnance, attacked the Hun in the
neighbourhood of the river Somme. A fortnight later the officers of
B Company found themselves in a dug-out in a certain wood. It is
now time to introduce Joshua.</p>
<p>Joshua was at that time our junior subaltern, and we called him
Joshua after Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS, on account of his artistic
attainments, though portraits by the hand of our Joshua tended
rather more in the direction of caricature than those I have seen
by his illustrious namesake. Upon the wall of that dug-out in that
wood, for instance, was displayed a crude though unmistakable
portrait of our revered Brigadier, a fact of which we were but too
conscious when our revered Brigadier paid us one night an
unexpected visit.</p>
<p>A short conversation ensued, during which the Brigadier gave
rein to a reprehensible passion he had for inquiring into the
<i>vie intime</i> of junior officers. Just as he was leaving he
turned to Joshua.</p>
<p>"Why do they call you 'Joshua'?" he asked. Joshua hesitated. His
eyes rested for an infinitesimal moment on the portrait on the
wall, then on the face of the Brigadier. He cursed me inwardly (as
he told me afterwards) for having addressed him by this name in
such strident tones just as the Brigadier was entering the dug-out;
but for the credit of the British Officer I am happy to say that
Joshua kept his head and showed that ready wit in an emergency
which is the soldier's greatest virtue.</p>
<p>"Well, Sir," he said, "I&mdash;I think it's because JOSHUA was a
great warrior."</p>
<p>"Ah, I hadn't thought of that," said the Brigadier as he took
his departure, while I subsided in a fainting condition on to the
floor of the dug-out and asked for brandy.</p>
<p>That night Joshua stopped a piece of shell with his head. We
managed to get him back, but I did not like the look of him and I
quite thought that his number was up. Before we pushed on next day
I took down the portrait of the Brigadier and slipped it into my
pocket-book. I had liked old Joshua well, and I thought I would
keep this as a memento not only of his art but of his ability in
spontaneous untruth.</p>
<p>That was, as I have said, in 1916. Much water had flowed between
the banks of the river Somme before, in August, 1918, Joshua and I
found ourselves in that neighbourhood once more.</p>
<p>But we did find ourselves there, for Joshua's head had proved
tougher than we thought, and with an enthusiasm beyond praise he
had recently wangled his return to the old regiment from a cushy
Base job, and was helping to hasten what we hoped and firmly
believed was Fritz's final "strategical retirement."</p>
<p>We had had three strenuous days, and now, while others carried
on the good work, we were resting by chance in that very wood of
which I have already spoken. I wandered forth at eventide over the
familiar ground, which had lain for some time well within the
German lines, and came suddenly upon the entrance to our old
dug-out! I went down into it and found that, apart from a litter of
empty ration-tins, it was unaltered. Then suddenly I bethought me
of the caricature which still lay in my pocket-book. I had never
told Joshua that I had kept it. It seemed a maudlin thing to have
done and moreover might have given him an exaggerated idea of my
opinion of his art. I took out the picture and looked at it. It had
weathered two years of warfare fairly well. Then with an indelible
pencil I scrawled below it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Sehr gute Bilde. F. Biermeister, 3 Preuss. Gard,</i>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a hazy recollection of school-German leading me to believe that
"<i>Sehr gute Bilde</i>" meant "Very good picture." Then I pinned
it up on the wall and went in search of Joshua.</p>
<p>"Do you remember that dug-out we used two years ago?" I asked
when I had found him.</p>
<p>"I do," said Joshua. "It was there that I told old Turnips I was
called Joshua after the O.C. Israelites at Jericho."</p>
<p>"That's the place," said I. "It's somewhere round here." And I
led him unostentatiously in the right direction.</p>
<p>"There it is," he cried. "It all comes back to me. Got a
flash-lamp?"</p>
<p>He disappeared below and I sat down and waited&mdash;waited for
sounds of astonishment and joy from the bowels of the earth. But I
waited in vain. Silence reigned. Then Joshua's head was thrust
upwards.</p>
<p>"Biermeister!" he called. "You, Biermeister of the 3rd Prussian
Guard, come away below here! There is one, Sir Joshua Reynolds, an
artist, would have a word with you."</p>
<p>I shook my head sadly. Another of my little jokes had proved a
dud. But I did not go below. Joshua is so rough sometimes.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>There is a race of gentle folk</p>
<p class="i2">Who dwell in Chiswick, well content</p>
<p>In houses ag&eacute;d as the oak,</p>
<p class="i2">But not unpleasing at the rent;</p>
<p>They look across the sunny stream</p>
<p class="i2">As Dr. JOHNSON used to look,</p>
<p>And all their lives are one long dream,</p>
<p class="i2">Though <i>none</i> of them has got a cook,</p>
<p>And there are whispers in the camp,</p>
<p>"It's jolly, but it <i>is</i> so damp."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But they are <i>not</i> exciting. No;</p>
<p class="i2">And you would find that Chiswick Mall</p>
<p>At half-past nine at night or so</p>
<p class="i2">Is far from being Bacchanal;</p>
<p>For, though there come from Chiswick Eyot</p>
<p class="i2">Soft sounds of something going on</p>
<p>Where the wild herons congregate</p>
<p class="i2">And revel madly with the swan,</p>
<p>You might suppose the people dead.</p>
<p>You mustn't; they have gone to bed.</p>

<p class="i2">A strange degrading thing occurred;</p>
<p>A startled Chiswick woke to hear</p>
<p class="i2">Such noise as she has never heard,</p>
<p>The sound of dance and singing at</p>
<p>About eleven. O my hat!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Yes, it was bad. But what is worse</p>
<p class="i2">They know not yet who broke the code,</p>
<p>And the dread Chiswick Fathers' curse</p>
<p class="i2">Still hovers sadly, unbestowed</p>
<p>Nay, there are wild false tales about</p>
<p class="i2">And hideous accusations made;</p>
<p>Men say old Piper led the rout</p>
<p class="i2">With that young fellow from "The Glade,"</p>
<p>While old maids murmur with a tear,</p>
<p>"I'm told it was the Rector, dear."</p>
</div>

<h2>THE OPIUM HOUND.</h2>
<p>Philip is a solicitor whose solicitations are confined to
Hongkong and the Far East generally. Just now he is also a special
constable, for the duration. He is other things as well, but the
above should serve as a general introduction.</p>
<p>In his capacity as special constable he keeps an eagle eye upon
the departing river steamers and the passengers purposing to travel
in them, his idea being to detect them in the act of attempting to
export opium without a permit, one of the deadly sins.</p>
<p>A little while ago Philip came into the possession of a dog of
doubtful ancestry and antecedents, but reputed to be intelligent.
It was called "Little Willie" because of its marked tendency to the
predatory habit. His other leading characteristic was an inordinate
craving for Punter's "Freak" biscuits.</p>
<p>One day Philip had a brain-wave. "I will teach Little Willie,"
he said, "to smell out opium concealed in passengers' luggage, and
I shall acquire merit and the Superintendent of Imports and Exports
will acquire opium." So he borrowed some opium from that official
and concealed it about the house and in his office, and by-and-by
what was required of him seemed to dawn on Little Willie, and every
time he found a <i>cache</i> of the drug he was rewarded with a
Punter's "Freak" biscuit.</p>
<p>At last his education was pronounced to be complete and Philip
marched proudly down to the Canton wharf with the Opium Hound.
There was a queue of passengers waiting to be allowed on board, and
the ceremony of the examination of their baggage was going on.
Little Willie was invited to take a hand, which he did in a rather
perfunctory way, without any real interest in the proceedings.
Indeed, his attention wandered to the doings of certain
disreputable friends of his who had come down to the wharf in a
spirit of curiosity, and Philip had to recall him to the matter in
hand.</p>
<p>On a sudden a wonderful change came over the Opium Hound. A
highly respectable old lady of the <i>amah</i> or domestic servant
class came confidently along, carrying the customary round
lacquered wooden box, a neat bundle and a huge umbrella. She was
followed by a ragged coolie bearing a plethoric basket, lashed with
a stout rope, but bulging in all directions. Little Willie sniffed
once at the basket and stiffened. "Good dog," said Philip; "is that
opium you have found?" The hound's tail wagged furiously, and he
scratched at the basket in a paroxysm of excitement. The coolie
dropped it and ran away. The <i>amah</i> waxed voluble and attacked
Little Willie with the family umbrella. The hound grew more and
more enthusiastic for the quest. Philip issued the fiat, "Open that
basket, it contains opium," and struck an attitude.</p>
<p>The basket was solemnly unlashed amid the <i>amah's</i> shrill
expostulations, and the contents soon flowed out upon the floor of
the examination-hut. There was the usual conglomeration: Two pairs
working trousers (blue cotton), two ditto jackets to match, one
suit silk brocade for high days and holidays, two white aprons,
three pairs Chinese shoes, three and a half pairs of Mississy's
silk stockings, several mysterious under garments (from the same
source); one cigarette tin containing sewing materials, buttons of
all sorts and sizes <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id=
"page46"></a>[pg 46]</span> nine empty cotton-reels, three spools
from a sewing-machine, one pair nail-scissors (broken); one
cigar-box containing several yards of tape (varying widths),
cuttings of many different materials, one button-hook, one
tin-opener and corkscrew combined, one silver thimble, one ditto
(horn), one Chinese pipe; one packet of tea, one ditto sugar, one
tin condensed milk (unopened), half a loaf of bread (very stale),
two empty medicine bottles&mdash;but no opium!</p>
<p>Little Willie was nearly delirious by this time, and tried to
get into the basket, which was now all but empty. The search
continued, and two rolls of material were lifted out: five and a
quarter yards of white calico and three yards of pink silk. This
exposed the bottom of the basket, where lay a tin! Ah, the opium at
last. Philip stepped forward and prised off the lid
triumphantly.</p>
<p>The contents consisted solely of Punter's "Freak" biscuits.</p>
<p>Little Willie has been dismissed from his position as Opium
Sleuth-hound.</p>

<h2>HOW TO DINE WISELY&mdash;BUT NOT TOO WELL.</h2>
<p>We are exceedingly pleased to note that our contemporary, <i>The
Pall Mall Gazette</i>, preaches frugality in the most practical
manner by providing a daily <i>menu</i> card, with helpful comments
on the preparation of the viands. The time for an unrestricted
dietary is still far off, and it is a work of national importance
to encourage the thrifty use of what our contemporary calls
"left-overs." Herein we are only following ancient and honourable
precedent, one of the earliest lyrics in the language informing us
that</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"What they did not eat that day</p>
<p>The Queen next morning fried."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Our only fault with the <i>P.M.G.</i>'s <i>chef</i> is that he
is inclined to err on the side of generosity. The dinner for
January 6th, for instance, is composed of no fewer than four
dishes, of which only one is a "left-over." The bill of fare opens
with "Kipper meat on toast"; it proceeds with a fine
<i>crescendo</i> to "Beef <i>&aacute; la jardini&egrave;re</i>,"
followed by "Fried macaroni," and declining gracefully on "Cabinet
pudding."</p>
<p>"Left-over meat," as our contemporary remarks, "is more of a
problem nowadays than ever before, for, being generally imported,
it is not so tender as the pre-war home-grown meat to begin with,
and the small amounts that can be saved from the rationed joint
rarely seem sufficient for another meal." An excellent plan,
therefore, would be to provide all the members of the family with
magnifying-glasses. It is easy to believe a thing to be large when
it looks large. Also there is great virtue in calling a thing by a
nutritious name. "Kipper on toast" is not nearly so rich in
carbohydrates, calories and aplanatic amygdaloids as "Kipper
<i>meat</i>." As for the preparation of "left-overs" in such a way
as to render them both appetising and palatable, "all that need be
done is to add a few vegetables and cook them over again." And
herein, as our instructor most luminously observes, "lies one
solution of the problem of quantity, for the amount of vegetables
used, if not the meat, can be measured by the size of the family
appetite." Once more the wisdom of the ancients comes to our help,
for, as it has been said, "the less you eat the hungrier you are,
and the hungrier you are the more you eat. Therefore the less you
eat the more you eat." The instructions for the preparation of a
sauce for the "Beef <i>&aacute; la jardini&egrave;re</i>" seem to
us rather lavish. It is suggested that we should give the whole a
good brown colour by dissolving in it "a teaspoonful of any beef
extract." Walnut juice is just as effective. If the "left-over" is
made of "silver-side," the silver should be carefully extracted and
sent to the Mint. The choice of the vegetables must of course
depend on the idiosyncrasies of the family. In the best families
the prejudice against parsnips is sometimes ineradicable. But if
chopped up with kitten meat and onions their intrinsic savour is
largely disguised. Fried macaroni, as the <i>P.M.G. chef</i>
remarks in an inspired passage, is delicious if properly prepared
with hot milk and quickly fried in hot fat. But, on the other hand,
if treated with spermaceti or train-oil it loses much of its
peninsular charm.</p>
<p>Cabinet pudding, if a "left-over," should perhaps be called
"reconstruction pudding." Here again the amount of egg and sugar
used must vary in a direct ratio with the size of the family
appetite. Prepared to suit that of the family of the late Dr.
TANNER, such a dinner as the above is not merely inexpensive, it
costs nothing at all.</p>

<h2><i>L&Egrave;SE-MAJEST&Eacute;.</i></h2>
<p>Our triumphal march into Germany having been arrested just west
of the Meuse, Sir DOUGLAS HAIG (through the usual channels) gave me
ten days' leave to visit the historic town of St. Omer. As I only
asked for seven-days and he gave me ten I knew there was a catch
somewhere. It appeared that the ten days was worked out on the idea
that it would take me five days to get there and five to get back.
Needless to say I ignored trains, which are a snare and delusion in
these days. I lorry-hopped. Most people would think many times
before lorry-hopping from Charleroi to Lille <i>vi&acirc;</i>
Brussels and Tournai, but there is nothing that a man with a leave
warrant in his pocket will not do&mdash;except perhaps save
money.</p>
<p>It was during this leave that I barged right into GEORGE,
"George" being our very own King, besides being Emperor of
India.</p>
<p>To bridge the apparent gap between my arrival and the perturbing
catastrophe referred to, it is only necessary to add that if you
enter from the main route from Hazebrouck you will find just off
the road a convoy of some sixty dear things seeing as much life as
can be beheld while groping into the insides of the Red Cross motor
ambulance which it is their job to feed, wash, coax and drive.</p>
<p>I have the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> here (except when the relentless
Miss Commanding Officer chases me out for breaking the
two-and-a-half rules which govern the place), and when I admitted
incautiously that the only place on the Front that I had not seen
or been frightened at was Passchendaele, they smiled pityingly and
promised to take me there on Sunday for a joy ride. Shades of 1917!
What whirligigs of circumstance time and the armistice have brought
us! It was in the joy ride we nearly upset a dynasty.</p>
<p>To accomplish the journey in greater comfort, Vee and her hut
companion Sadie got hold of a perfectly good Colonel man who had a
perfectly good car and had, moreover, a perfectly good excuse to go
to Passchendaele (he was really going to Boulogne), but wanted to
get a good flying start, and we set off. We were a perfectly
organised unit, consisting of four sections (including two No. 2
Brownie Sections), A.S.C. complement (one lunch basket), Aid Post
(bandage and thermometer, carried as a matter of course by Sadie,
who thinks of these things), a Scotch dog (mascot) and a flask of
similar nationality (medical comforts for the troops).</p>
<p>On our arrival at Ypres the traffic man held up his hand. That
in itself would not have been important, for we have it on great
authority that the blind eye may be employed on really special
occasions, but the fellow stood determinedly in the middle of the
road, and even traffic men, we have always insisted, should not be
run over except on great provocation.</p>
<p>"All traffic stopped between 12 and 2," he said; "the KING is
passing by."</p>
<p>We looked blankly at one another. I have an extraordinary
respect for HIS MAJESTY, but I did wish that he did more of his
work by aeroplane at times.</p>
<p>We ate sandwiches, selected and sited positions for sniping the
royal progress with our No. 2 Brownies and photographed everything
we saw, including an American cooker, the historic "Goldfish
Chateau," and a Belgian leading a little pig, with the inscription,
"The only good Bosch in the country"; but on the whole Ypres on a
Sunday afternoon is hardly more exciting than the "great commercial
centre" of Scotland.</p>
<p>At intervals the Staff dashed up and spoke a word or two to the
traffic man, but they departed again and nothing happened. We
<i>all</i> had a turn at that traffic man, and what we don't know
about his home life, pre-war and probable post-war troubles, isn't
worth putting on any demobilisation paper. And each time we tackled
him we got a different idea of the KING'S movements&mdash;HIS
MAJESTY must have had an extraordinarily complex journey that
day.</p>
<p>Suddenly we were free! The KING was going to lunch near the
Cloth Hall and would not be by till 2.30 P.M. Knowing that
<i>any</i> order emanating from a Staff is liable to instant
cancellation we rushed back to the car and told the driver to "Go!"
with the "G" hard, as in shell fire. Whether we went round or over
the traffic man I don't know, but we slid with terrific speed into
Ypres. Traffic was a little congested round the ruined cathedral,
and we barged right up against a panting Ford, which had one lung
completely gone and the other seemingly a little porous. A stream
of traffic was coming down our side of the road; no matter, we must
get on. Urged on by our advice the driver pulled out from behind
the dying Ford and tried to pass. It was fearfully exciting. Some
Staff on the bank began to wave to us. Thinking perhaps they knew
some of us, or thought the girls looked nice, I smiled and nodded
back. More Staff waved more arms. We were awfully pleased with our
reception. Still three abreast on the road, the Ford having
flickered up before death, we reached the crossroads as a large car
with a flag on it came round the corner. The car stopped dead. So
did we. The two cars glared at each other. The Ford writhed forward
hideously in its death agony. I thought I felt funny, and when Vee
whispered something about "the Royal Standard" I knew why. Royal
Standard? Good Lord! I had visions of three laboriously acquired
pips being torn from my sleeves by outraged authorities. The air
was rent by my wild yell to our driver to go on&mdash;<i>go on</i>
and carry the Ford with us on our bonnet if necessary.</p>
<p>What happened next is not very clear in my memory. I have a hazy
picture of purple A.P.M.'s, of our GEORGE sitting calmly in a Rolls
Royce, of irrepressible woman poking a No. 2 Brownie against the
window of our car and trying to find a perfectly good king in a
small viewfinder; of the Colonel on my right saluting, with a
fearful waggle of the hand, without his hat on, that article having
been simply swept off by my own tremendous
"circular-motion-thumb-close-to-the-forefinger-touching-the-peak-of-the-cap,
etc., etc." Through the haze I saw HIS MAJESTY graciously return
our salute and I seem to recollect Vee taking his salute as a
personal compliment to the feminine element in the car, and smiling
back delightedly in return.</p>
<p>The next thing I remember was that the car had passed, the
traffic man was gazing reproachfully at us, the Ford had expired
and our chauffeur had stopped his engine. I don't know what Sadie
did all this time, but since, from her position, she must have seen
the whole thing in better perspective, I don't wonder the girl
looked white.</p>
<p>Returning to consciousness I heard Vee utter a tremendous sigh
of intense satisfaction.</p>
<p>"I <i>sniped</i> him," she said, and cuddled the No. 2 Brownie
affectionately.</p>
<p>"Did you turn it round after the last one?" I asked
suddenly.</p>
<p>"No, didn't you?"</p>
<p>And of course we hadn't. And there, in the undeveloped spool
lies HIS MAJESTY superimposed on the back of the Bosch piglet we
had photographed outside Ypres. Isn't that just the hardest of
luck?</p>
<p>I'm going to ask if I can develop the film without running the
risk of losing my commission. After all it's not so very
inappropriate, is it?</p>

<h3>THE RULE OF THE ROAD.</h3>
<p>I admire all poilus, and especially did I admire Pierre. Once
only did I find him at fault. It was one of my functions on a
hospital ship plying between &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; to
wheel about the more fortunate of the patients. On the occasion on
which I met Pierre he was journeying to his mother in London and
was temporarily engaged in the same pursuit. I beheld him
approaching with his charge and immediately ported my helm. He bore
down on his, keeping to his right, and we collided.</p>
<p>"Keep to your left, you fool!" I cried as the crash came.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais non! le droit, M'sieur.</i>"</p>
<p>Here was a deadlock indeed. It was an English ship, therefore
the English rule of the road should be maintained. On the other
hand, the fact that we were still in French waters was in his
favour. But my stubborn British will would not give way, and Heaven
knows how long we should have remained there had not one of the
invalids grunted, "Caan't thee keep t' the rule o' the waater?" and
I saw a dignified way out of the difficulty. I withdrew to the
right, and we passed on with no animosity towards one another.
Still, it was a near thing for the Entente.</p>

<h2>THE NEW GAME.</h2>
<p>If Hubbard were not my friend I should describe him as one of
the most amiable and most muddle-headed of mankind. Under the
influence of his mind things that are quite clear become confused
and lose themselves in long vistas of statement and sub-statement
and sub-sub-statement, and a plain tale is darkened until at the
end nothing is left of what it originally was. If you don't believe
me listen to what follows.</p>
<p>We were sitting in the drawing-room one evening recently; the
various topics of the day having been more or less exhausted,
somebody proposed a round game as a diversion. Hubbard saw his
chance and dashed in. "Yes, by Jove," he said, "let's have the new
game of 'Likenesses;' it's a perfectly ripping game. I played it
the other day and never laughed so much in my life."</p>
<p>"How do you play it?" I said.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Hubbard, "it's one of the easiest games in the world.
All you have to do is to keep your mind clear and remember what you
are driving at."</p>
<p>"Right," I said. "But what are you driving at?"</p>
<p>"Well," said Hubbard, "one of us goes out or stops his ears and
the rest choose somebody."</p>
<p>"There's nothing very new about that," I said; "I've played it a
thousand times."</p>
<p>"Wait a bit," said Hubbard, "and don't be so ready to plunge. I
tell you this is an entirely new and original game."</p>
<p>"Let him," said somebody else, "get on with it in his own way or
we shall be here till past midnight. Go ahead, Hubbard."</p>
<p>"Well," said Hubbard, "you choose somebody to be a likeness.
When your man comes in again he begins to ask questions."</p>
<p>"Vegetable, animal or mineral," said Butterfield, "I knew it
was."</p>
<p>"No, it isn't," said Hubbard. "The man who has gone out and has
come in says to you, What food does the person you've chosen remind
you of? and you say tapioca pudding or beef-steak and kidney
pie."</p>
<p>"But," I said, "there's nobody in the whole wide world who
reminds me of either of those things."</p>
<p>"Well, you can choose your own food," said Hubbard. "If you
don't like tapioca pudding you can answer scrambled eggs. Only
scrambled eggs must remind you of the person you have in your mind.
Then you go on to the next man, and you ask him what cloth he
reminds you of, and he answers tweed or Irish frieze or best
Angola."</p>
<p>"Can anybody," said Butterfield, "tell me what 'best Angola'
means? I've seen it often in my tailor's bills; mostly, I think, as
waistcoats, but I've never known what it really is. If I had to
guess now I should say it is something composed in equal parts of
fancy waistcoats, tapioca pudding and scrambled eggs."</p>
<p>"Well, you'd be wrong," said Hubbard; "it's nothing of the sort.
When you have got as far as scrambled eggs your man ought to begin
to have a faint glimmering&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But," I said, "there's the tapioca pudding. What are you going
to do with that? You can't be allowed to play fast and loose with
that."</p>
<p>"Don't you see," said Hubbard, "that that's a mere example and
now done with? Do please remember that we have got on to Irish
frieze. You must allow me to explain the game in my own way. Now
your man tackles the next person in turn. What building, he asks,
does he remind you of? and the answer is Cologne Cathedral or the
Bank of England."</p>
<p>"It would be difficult to choose anyone who reminded me of
either of those celebrated structures," I said, "but I'll take the
Bank of England for choice."</p>
<p>"But," said Hubbard, "you don't <i>take</i> either of them, you
see it in a flash and it's gone."</p>
<p>"What do you see in a flash?" I said.</p>
<p>"The building that the man who has gone out and is asking
questions in order to guess the person everybody is thinking of
reminds you of," said Hubbard.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. That makes it absolutely clear," said Butterfield.
"Let's get to work. Personally I haven't got beyond scrambled
eggs."</p>
<p>"And I am lost in tapioca," I said. "Let's get to bed." That's
as far as Hubbard ever got with the explanation of his game. We
left him struggling and went to bed.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>).</h4>
<p>Battle-books have already come to wear (even in so short a time)
a strangely archaic aspect. But <i>Through the Hindenburg Line</i>
(HODDER AND STOUGHTON) is, as its name tells you, nearer to date
than most. The writer, Mr. F.A. MCKENZIE, was a Canadian war
correspondent whom the Canadian Staff, believing (as he himself
says) "that the right place for a war correspondent is where he can
see what he is supposed to describe," allowed to live among the
troops in the front line. As a result of this unusual privilege,
his pictures of the great fights in the last stages of the War have
the reality of personal experience. The actual smashing of the
Line, for example, is an epic of heroism and achievement still
hardly realised by people at home, who cling to an idea that the
final victories were gained over an enemy enfeebled and at
disadvantage. There are other chapters in the record that may
perhaps hardly be welcomed at this moment by those amiable
sentimentalists who would have us treat the enemy as a Bosch and a
brother. The hospital raid at Etaples is one of them; when, even
after the light of the burning huts had made ignorance impossible,
the gentle Hun, swooping low, swept with machine-gun fire the
nurses and doctors who were attempting to remove the wounded. That,
I think, is a memory that will linger. Another picture, queerly
disproportionate in the anger it excites, is that of the fruit
garden in a great country house, with its wealth of famous old
peach and pear trees still in place along the walls, but every one
methodically sawn through. By comparison a trifling crime, but
somehow I may forget other things more easily. One would welcome
the revised judgment of Dr. SOLF upon this particular expression of
the German spirit.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>To those who have been persuaded by writers like Mr. H.G. WELLS
that the horse has not and ought not to have any part in modern
warfare, Captain SIDNEY GALTREY'S <i>The Horse and the War</i>
("COUNTRY LIFE") will come as a revelation. Mr. WELLS has said that
the sight of a soldier wearing spurs makes him sick, or words to
that effect; yet so neglectful were our military authorities of Mr.
WELLS'S opinions and teaching that they went on steadily adding
horses, many of them cavalry horses, to the Army. We began the War
with twenty-five thousand horses, and we finished it with
considerably more than a million, to say nothing of the mules, who
diffused an air of cynical amusement over the military proceedings
in which they were compelled to bear a part. This may conceivably
be one more proof in Mr. WELLS'S eyes of our incurable stupidity.
But those who have watched the work of our armies at close quarters
will be the last to agree with him. Captain GALTREY in fact proves
his case. He has an enthusiasm for horses and has written a most
interesting book. The illustrations are excellent and appropriate,
and the book is admirably got up.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Valour is apt to get the better of discretion in any novel that
attempts to be quite up to date with a political subject. Mrs.
TWEEDALE places <i>The Veiled Woman</i> (JENKINS) in some vague
period later than August, 1914, largely in order to decry a
Government that really by now one fails to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> identify,
and to let off sundry feminist squibs and crackers which, in view
of the present position of woman suffrage, can only be described as
fireworks half-price on the 6th of November. Further, to get all my
grumbles frankly over, she so constantly makes sweeping assertions
against the other sex that even the most chivalrous of male
reviewers may be inclined to kick. To hear a lady pronounce once or
twice that the males of the species are obviously diminishing in
stature and strength, or that the whole programme of the earth's
return to the highest ideals is in woman's hands, may be good for
the masculine soul, but after a while it brings up vividly BESANT'S
story of <i>The Revolt of Man</i>&mdash;what happened then and just
why. The claim to a monopoly of self-sacrifice in particular comes
very badly in war-time. All the same, if you cut out this
top-hamper the story of <i>The Veiled Woman</i> on its personal
side is distinctly a good one. I wished the heroine had not spoiled
her fine enthusiasms by mixing them so freely with a personal
vendetta; but after all it is not the characterisation that
intrigues one here. The plot&mdash;which I will not spoil by giving
it away&mdash;goes excellently, and works up to a capital
climax.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. BOYD CABLE is the literary liaison officer between the
Infantry and the Air Force. In the wonderful stories contained in
<i>Airmen O' War</i> (MURRAY) his object is to make the armies on
the ground understand what they owe to the armies of the air. If
they suffer from a lack of understanding, this is not, I gather,
likely to be removed by the airmen themselves, for they have
evidently imbibed some of the spirit of our Navy and are
magnificently reluctant to talk about their achievements. But this
reticence has its dangers, and Mr. BOYD CABLE has set to work to
remove them. Here he has written nothing for which he cannot find
"an actual parallel fact." I honestly believe him and commend his
book both to those who have a passion for tales of high adventure
and also to those&mdash;if there are such&mdash;who need authentic
instances of what our Airmen O' War have done for us.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The best I can honestly say of <i>Tony Heron</i> (COLLINS) is
that it has all the makings of a good novel, but unfortunately
stops there, unmade or rather unvitalized. It is the tale of a
boy's upbringing by a sternly antagonistic father, of his growth to
maturity, his love affairs, and in due course his relations with
his own son. All the events happen that are proper to a scheme of
this type; but somehow, despite the fact that Mr. C. KENNETT BURROW
wields a practised and often picturesque pen, the whole affair
remains a literary exercise and declines to come alive. Perhaps in
justice I should except two characters, <i>Roland</i>, the
sturdy-son born out of wedlock to <i>Tony</i>, and <i>Phil</i>,
weakling child of old <i>Heron</i> by a second marriage. Both these
and the relation of the pair to each other furnish a pleasant
contrast to the an&aelig;mia which seems to affect the rest of the
tale. Stay, there is yet another, <i>Kenrick</i>, the private tutor
of <i>Tony</i>, whose treatment by the author is at least vigorous.
I found him just a little surprising. A creature, we are told, over
fond of good food and wine, who, dining with his pupil on the
latter's sixteenth birthday and attempting convivial airs, is shown
his place with a promptitude recalling the best manner of the
eighteenth century. Subsequently, one gathers, he took to chronic
alcoholism, combined with amateur blackmail; and a final appearance
shows the fellow dribbling wine over the evening shirt, to whose
wear the author is at pains to tell us he was unused. Clearly a low
race, these tutors, about whom I seem hitherto to have been
strangely misinformed.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Captain ROBERT B. ROSS has made excellent business of <i>The
Fifty-First in France</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON). In any case there
could be no doubts about the merits of this famous Scottish
territorial division; it is one of the very many British divisions
which has proved itself the best of all. I recall its first
appearance at the Front as a constituted unit, and can speak to it
that the impression its arrival caused was welcome and comforting.
But our author is not only a soldier; he has also the literary art.
Clearly he appreciates that a fine subject is not all that is
wanted to make a good book; that one needs, for instance, the gift
of observation, the power of conveying an impression, and a reserve
of humour always ready at need. All these are his in abundance. His
book treats of two earlier periods of the war; the second, the
long-drawn offensive of the Somme, will make the most intimate
appeal to men of his own and the other divisions involved. To those
who knew the affair at first hand the story will recall much that
they saw and felt themselves; often they will recognise a
map-reading or will come across the name of a humble billet which
they too regarded as a paradise replete with every modern comfort.
Upon those who now learn it for the first time a deep and enduring
impression will be produced. Captain Ross writes always with a due
respect for the serious nature of his subject; but there are times
when he breaks away from his military and literary discipline.
There is for example, a moment when he dines well, "no more wisely
than was desirable, no less wisely than was excusable." It must be
added that the accompanying sketches are, if not of an ambitious
order, yet of a certain merit. At any rate they assist.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
