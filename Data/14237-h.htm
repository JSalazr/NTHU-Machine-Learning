<h2 class="dgp">Preface.</h2>

<p class="noindent">It is a fact conceded by all, that the constitution of the
Christian family, and its social and spiritual relations, are
not as fully developed as they should be. In this age of
extreme individualism, we have almost left out of view the
mission of home as the first form of society, and the important
bearing it has upon the formation of character. Its interests
are not appreciated; its duties and privileges are neglected;
husbands and wives do not fully realize their moral
relation to each other; parents are inclined to renounce their
authority; and children, brought up in a state of domestic
libertinism, neither respect nor obey their parents as they
should. The idea of human character as a development
from the nursery to the grave, is not realized. Home as a
preparation for both the state and the church, and its bearing,
as such, upon the prosperity of both, are renounced as
traditionary, and too old and stale to suit this age of mechanical
progression and "young Americanism."</p>

<p class="dgp">As a consequence, the influence of home is lost; the lambs
of the flock are neglected, grow up in spiritual ignorance,

and become a curse both to themselves and to their parents.
The vice and infidelity which prevail to such an alarming extent
in the present day, may be ascribed to parental neglect
of the young. The desolating curse of heaven invariably
accompanies neglect of domestic obligations and duties; it
was this that constituted that dreadful degeneracy which preceded
the coming of the Messiah. The parents were alienated
from the children, and the children from their parents.
And the only way in which the Jews could avert deserved
and impending ruin, was by "turning the heart of the fathers
to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers."</p>

<p class="dgp">We must adopt the same method. We need in the present
day a deeper and more scriptural sense, both in the state
and church, of the importance of the family, and of its position
in the sphere of natural and religious life. The attention
of the people should be directed to the nature, the influences,
the responsibilities, the prerogatives, duties and blessings
of the Christian home.</p>

<p class="dgp">Any work which contributes to this end is worthy of our
high regard and subserves a noble purpose; for it is only
when the details of home-life are given to the public, that
proper interest in them will be developed, and we can hope
for a better state of things in this first form of associated
life.</p>

<p class="dgp">The following work is an humble contribution to this important
cause. It is intended to excite interest in the religious
elements of family life, and to show that the development
of individual character and happiness in the church
and state, in time and in eternity, starts with, and depends

upon, home-training and nurture. The author, in presenting
it to the public, is fully conscious of its many palpable imperfections;
yet, as it is his first effort, and as it was prepared
amid the multiplied perplexities and interruptions of his professional
life, he confidently expects that it will be received
with charitable consideration. It is now published as an introduction
to a work on the historical development of home,
to which his attention has for years been directed. If this
unassuming volume should be instrumental in the saving of
one family from ruin, we shall feel ourself fully compensated.</p>

<div class="div" id="c1Section1">
<a name="toc_4"></a>
<h3 class="dgp">Section I.&mdash;Home In The Sphere Of Nature.</h3>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"My home! the spirit of its love is breathing</p>
<p class="l">  In every wind that plays across my track,</p>
<p class="l">From its white walls the very tendrils wreathing</p>
<p class="l">  Seem with soft links to draw the wanderer back.</p>
<p class="l">There am I loved&mdash;there prayed for!&mdash;there my mother</p>
<p class="l">  Sits by the hearth with meekly thoughtful eye,</p>
<p class="l">There my young sisters watch to greet their brother;</p>
<p class="l">  Soon their glad footsteps down the path will fly!</p>
<p class="l">And what is home? and where, but with the loving?"</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="hi" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Home!</span> That name touches every fibre of the
soul, and strikes every chord of the human heart
as with angelic fingers. Nothing but death can
break its spell. What tender associations are
linked with home! What pleasing images and
deep emotions it awakens! It calls up the fondest
memories of life, and opens in our nature

the purest, deepest, richest gush of consecrated
thought and feeling.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Home! &#8217;tis a blessed name! And they who rove,</p>
<p class="l">Careless or scornful of its pleasant bonds,</p>
<p class="l">Nor gather round them those linked soul to soul</p>
<p class="l">By nature&#8217;s fondest ties,...</p>
<p class="l">  But dream they&#8217;re happy!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But what <em>is</em> home,&mdash;home in the sphere of nature?
It is not simply an ideal which feeds the
fancy, nor the flimsy emotion of a sentimental
heart. We should seek for its meaning, not in
the flowery vales of imagination, but amid the
sober realities of thought and of faith.</p>

<p class="dgp">Home is not the mere dwelling place of our
parents, and the theater upon which we played
the part of merry childhood. It is not simply a
habitation. This would identify it with the lion&#8217;s
lair and the eagle&#8217;s nest. It is not the mere mechanical
juxtaposition of so many human beings,
herding together like animals in the den or stall.
It is not mere conventionalism,&mdash;a human association
made up of the nursery, the parlor, the
outward of domestic life, resting upon some
evanescent passion, some sensual impression and
policy. These do not make up the idea of home.</p>

<p class="dgp">Home is a divine institution, coeval and congenital
with man. The first home was in Eden; the
last home will be in Heaven. It is the first form
of society, a little commonwealth in which we first
lose our individualism and come to the consciousness
of our relation to others. Thus it is the

foundation of all our relationships in life,&mdash;the
preparation-state for our position in the State and
in the Church. It is the first form and development
of the associating principle, the normal relation
in which human character first unfolds itself.
It is the first partnership of nature and of life; and
when it involves "the communion of saints," it
reaches its highest form of development. It is
an organic unity of nature and of interest,&mdash;the
moral center of all those educational influences
which are exerted upon our inward being. The
idea of the home-institution rests upon the true
love of our moral nature, involving the marriage
union of congenial souls, binding up into itself
the whole of life, forming and moulding all its
relations, and causing body, mind and spirit to
partake of a common evolution. The loving
soul is the central fact of home. In it the
inner life of the members find their true complement,
and enjoy a kind of community of
consciousness.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Home&#8217;s not merely four square walls,</p>
<p class="l">Though with pictures hung and gilded;</p>
<p class="l">Home is where affection calls&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Filled with shrines the heart hath builded."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Home may be viewed in a two-fold aspect, as
simply physical, and as purely moral. The former
comes finally to its full meaning and force only
in the latter. They are interwoven; we cannot
understand the one without the other; they are
complements; and the complete idea of home as

we find it in the sphere of nature, lies in the
living union of both.</p>

<p class="dgp">By the physical idea of home, we mean, not
only its outward, mechanical structure, made up
of different parts and members, but that living
whole or oneness into which these parts are
bound up. Hence it is not merely adventitious,&mdash;a
corporation of individual interests, but that
organic unity of natural life and interest in which
the members are bound up. By the moral idea
of home, we mean the union of the moral life and
interests of its members. This explodes the infidel
systems of Fourierism, Socialism, Mormonism,
and "Woman&#8217;s Rights." These forms of
Agrarianism destroy the ethical idea and mission
of home; for they are not only opposed to revelation
and history, but violate the plainest maxims
of natural affection.</p>

<p class="dgp">Love is an essential element of home. Without
this we may have the form of a home, but
not its spirit, its beating heart, its true motive
power, and its sunshine. The inward stream
would he gone, and home would not be the oneness
of kindred souls. Home-love is instinctive,
and begets all those silken chords, those sweet
harmonies, those tender sympathies and endearments
which give to the family its magic power.
This home-love is the mother of all home delights,
yea, of all the love of life. We first draw
love from our mother&#8217;s breast, and it is love
which ministers to our first wants. It flashes
from parent to parent, and from parent to child,

making-up the sunshine and the loveliness of
domestic life. Without it home would have no
meaning. It engenders the "home-feeling" and
the "home-sickness," and is the moral net-work
of the home-existence and economy. It is stronger
than death; it rises superior to adversity, and
towers in sublime beauty above the niggardly
selfishness of the world. Misfortune cannot suppress
it; enmity cannot alienate it; temptation
cannot enslave it. It is the guardian angel of the
nursery and the sick-bed; it gives an affectionate
concord to the partnership of home-life and interest.
Circumstances cannot modify it; it ever
remains the same, to sweeten existence, to purify
the cup of life, to smooth our rugged pathway
to the grave, and to melt into moral pliability
the brittle nature of man. It is the ministering
spirit of home, hovering in soothing caresses
over the cradle and the death-beds of the household,
and filling up the urn of all its sacred
memories.</p>

<p class="dgp">But home demands not only such love, but ties,
tender, strong, and sacred. These bind up the
many in the one. They are the fibres of the
home-life, and cannot be wrenched without causing
the heart to bleed at every pore. Death may
dissect them and tear away the objects around
which they entwine; and they will still live in
the imperishable love which survives. From
them proceed mutual devotions and confiding
faith. They bind together in one all-expanding
unity, the perogatives of the husband, and the

subordination of the wife, the authority of the
parent and the obedience of the child.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"O, not the smile of other lands,</p>
<p class="l">  Though far and wide our feet may roam,</p>
<p class="l">Can e&#8217;er untie the genial bands</p>
<p class="l">  That knit our hearts to home!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The mother is the angel-spirit of home. Her
tender yearnings over the cradle of her infant
babe, her guardian care of the child and youth,
and her bosom companionship with the man
of her love and choice, make her the personal
center of the interests, the hopes and the happiness
of the family. Her love glows in her
sympathies and reigns in all her thoughts and
deeds. It never cools, never tires, never dreads,
never sleeps, but ever glows and burns with
increasing ardor, and with sweet and holy incense
upon the altar of home-devotion. And
even when she is gone to her last rest, the
sainted mother in heaven sways a mightier
influence over her wayward husband or child,
than when she was present. Her departed spirit
still hovers over his affections, overshadows his
path, and draws him by unseen cords to herself
in heaven.</p>

<p class="dgp">Our nature demands home. It is the first essential
element of our social being. The whole
social system rests upon it: body, mind and
spirit are concerned in it. These cannot be
complete out of the home-relations; there would
be no proper equilibrium of life and character

without the home feeling and influence. The
heart, when bereaved and disappointed, naturally
turns for refuge to home-life and sympathy. No
spot is so attractive to the weary one; it is the
heart&#8217;s moral oasis; there is a mother&#8217;s watchful
love, and a father&#8217;s sustaining influence; there is
a husband&#8217;s protection, and a wife&#8217;s tender sympathy;
there is the circle of loving brothers and
sisters,&mdash;happy in each other&#8217;s love. Oh, what
is life without these? A desolation!&mdash;a painful,
glooming pilgrimage through "desert heaths
and barren sands." But home gives to life its
fertilizing dews, its budding hopes, and its blossoming
joys. When far away in distant lands
or upon the ocean&#8217;s heaving breast, we pine
away and become "home-sick;" no voice there
like a mother&#8217;s; no sympathy there like a
wife&#8217;s; no loved one there like a child; no
resting place there like home; and we cry
out, "Home! sweet, sweet home!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus our nature instinctively longs for the
deep love and the true hearts of home. It has
for our life more satisfaction than all the honors,
and the riches and the luxuries of the world.
We soon grow sick of these, and become sick
for home, however humble it may be. Its endearments
are ever fresh, as if in the bursting
joys of their first experience. They remain unforgotten
in our memories and imperishable in
our hearts. When friends become cold, society
heartless, and adversity frowns darkly and heavily
upon us, oh, it is then that we turn with fond assurance

to home, where loved ones will weep as
well as rejoice with us.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Oh, the blessing of a home, where old and young mix kindly,</p>
<p class="l">The young unawed, the old unchilled, in unreserved communion!</p>
<p class="l">Oh that refuge from the world, when a stricken son or daughter</p>
<p class="l">May seek with confidence of love, a father&#8217;s hearth and heart;</p>
<p class="l">Come unto me, my son, if men rebuke and mock thee,</p>
<p class="l">There always shall be one to bless,&mdash;for I am on thy side!"</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Section II.&mdash;Home In The Sphere Of The Church.</h3>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "A holy home,</p>
<p class="l">Where those who sought the footprints of the Lord,</p>
<p class="l">  Along the paths of pain, and care, and gloom,</p>
<p class="l">Shall find the rest of heaven a rich reward."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What is the <em>Christian</em> home? Only in the
sphere of christianity does the true idea of
home become fully developed. Home with the
savage is but a herding, a servitude. Even
among many of the Jews it was little better

than a Mahommedan seraglio. The most eminent
of the heathen world degrade the family
by making it the scene of lust, and introducing
concubinage and polygamy. Plato, one of the
most enlightened of the heathen, had base conceptions
of home, and abused its highest and
holiest prerogatives by his ideas of polygamy.
We find too that in the ethics of Aristotle, the
most lovely and sacred attributes of the family
are totally discarded. The home which he holds
up to view is unadorned with chastity and virtue.
And Sophocles follows in the same path, stripping
home of all that is sacred and essential to
its true constitution. And when we come down
to the present age, and view this divine institute
in the light of Mormonism and Socialism, who
will say that here we have unfolded its true idea
and sacred character?</p>

<p class="dgp">How different is the true Christian home!
Here the marriage union is preserved "honorable,"
held sacred, and woman is raised to her
true position. In the sphere of the Christian
church, home is brought fairly and completely
into view. Here it rises above the measure of
natural affection, and temporal interest. It enters
the sphere of supernatural faith, and becomes
the adumbration of our home in heaven.</p>

<p class="dgp">The Christian home is a true type of the
church. "The husband is the head of the
wife, as Christ is of the church." The love of
the family is self-denying and holy, like that
between Christ and His church. The children

are "the heritage of the Lord;" the parents are
His stewards. Like the church, the Christian
home has its ministry. Yea, the church is in
the home, as the mother is in her child. We
cannot separate them; they are correlatives.
The one demands the other. The Christian
home can have existence only in the sphere of
the church. It is the vestibule of the church,
bound to her by the bonds of Christian marriage,
of holy baptism, and of the communion
of saints, leading to her in the course of moral
development, and completing her life only in
the church-consciousness.</p>

<p class="dgp">Home is, therefore, a partnership of spiritual
as well as of natural life. The members thereof
dwell "as being heirs together of the grace of
life." "Heavenly mindedness," "the hidden
man of the heart," and a "hope full of immortality,"
are the ornaments of the Christian home.
Hers is "the incorruptibility of a meek and quiet
spirit;" her members are "joint heirs of salvation;"
they are "one," not only in nature, but
"in Christ." They enjoy a "communion in
spirit," that their "joy might be full." "What
God, therefore, hath joined together, let not man
put asunder."</p>

<p class="dgp">Such a home, being "right with God," must
be "full of good fruits, without partiality and
without hypocrisy." Here the Christian shows
his real character. In the sphere of the church,
the family reaches its highest excellence and its
purest enjoyment. Says the learned D&#8217;Aubigne,

"Without the knowledge and the love of God, a
family is but a collection of individuals who may
have more or less of natural affection for one
another; but the real bond,&mdash;the love of God
our Father, in Jesus Christ, our Lord,&mdash;is wanting."</p>

<p class="dgp">We, therefore, abuse the idea of home when
we divest it of the religious element. As the
family is a divine institute and a type of the
church and of heaven, it cannot be understood
in its isolation from christianity; it must involve
Christian principles, duties, and interests;
and embrace in its educational functions, a preparation,
not only for the State, but also for the
church. The church gives to home a sacred
religious ministry, a spiritual calling, a divine
mission; investing it with prophetic, priestly
and kingly prerogatives, and laying it under
religious responsibilities.</p>

<p class="dgp">This gives to the Christian home its true
meaning, and secures for its members&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"A sacred and home-felt delight,</p>
<p class="l">A sober certainty of waking bliss."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Such was the home of Abraham, who "commanded
his children and his household to keep
the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment,"&mdash;of
Joshua, who with "his house served
the Lord,"&mdash;of David, who "returned to bless
his household,"&mdash;of Job, who "offered burnt-offering
according to the number of his sons,"&mdash;of
Cornelius, who "feared God with all his

house,"&mdash;of Lydia, and Crispus, and the jailor
of Philippi, who "believed in the Lord with all
their house."</p>

<p class="dgp">How many Christian parents practically discard
this attribute of home! While all their
temporal interests cluster around their home,
and their hearts are fondly wedded to it as
their retreat from a cold and repulsive world,
they never think perhaps that God is in their
family, that He has instituted it, and given those
cherished ones who "set like olive plants around
their table." They are faithful to all natural
duties, and make ample provision for the temporal
wants of their offspring; the mother bends
with untiring assiduity over the cradle of her
babe, and ministers to all its wants, watching
with delight every opening beauty of that bud
of promise, and willingly sacrificing all for its
good. With what rapture she catches its first
lispings of mother! The father toils from year
to year to secure it a fair patrimony, a finished
education, and an honorable position in life.
How unremittingly these parents watch over
the sick-bed of their children and of each
other; and oh, what burning tears gush forth
as the utterance of their agonizing hearts, when
death threatens to blight a single bud, or lay
his cold hand upon a single member!</p>

<p class="dgp">This is all right, noble, and faithful to the
natural elements of home. Natural affection
prompts it, and it is well. But if this is all;
if Christian parents and their children are governed

only by the promptings of nature; if they
are bound together by no spiritual ties and interests
and hopes; if they are not prompted by
faith to make provision for the soul, and for
eternity; then we think they have not as yet
realized the deepest and holiest significance of
their home.</p>

<p class="dgp">The Christian home demands the Christian
consciousness,&mdash;the sense of a spirit-world with
all its obligations and interests and responsibilities.
Oh, is it not too often the case that even
the Christian mother, while she teaches her babe
the accents of her own name, never thinks of
teaching it to lisp the name of Jesus,&mdash;never
seeks to unfold its infant spirit,&mdash;never supplies
it with spiritual food, nor directs its soul to the
eternal world! In the same way the pious wife
neglects her impenitent husband; and the pious
husband, his reckless wife. There is too much
such dereliction of duty in the homes of church
members.</p>

<p class="dgp">Our homes give us an interest in, and bind us
by peculiar bonds to, the eternal world; those
loved ones who have gone before us, look down
from heaven upon those they have left behind;
though absent from us in body, their spirits are
still with us; and they come thronging upon
glowing pinions, as ministering spirits, to our
hearts. Mother! that little babe that perished
in your arms, hovers over thee now, and is the
guardian angel of your heart and home. It
meets thee still! And oh, how joyful will your

home-meeting be in heaven! Children! the
spirit of your sainted mother lingers around
your home to minister in holy things to thee.
She has left you in body; she lies mouldering
now in the humid earth; but she is with thee in
spirit. Your home, dwelling in the sphere of
the church on earth, has a spiritual communion
with the sainted ones of the church in heaven.
Thus, as the home-feeling can never he eradicated,
so the home-meetings can never be broken
up. Even the dead are with us there; their
seats may be empty, and their forms may no
longer move before us; but their spirits meet
with us, and imprint their ministrations upon
our hearts. The dead and the living meet in
home!</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter II.&mdash;The Mission Of The Christian Home.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"If in the family thou art the best,</p>
<p class="l">Pray oft, and be mouth unto the rest;</p>
<p class="l">Whom God hath made the heads of families,</p>
<p class="l">He hath made priests to offer sacrifice."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The home is a divine institution, and includes
the religious element, moving in the sphere of
nature and of the church, then its calling must
be of God; its mission is divine; it is designed
to subserve a spiritual purpose; it has a soul-mission.
This was the view of David when he
"returned to <em>bless</em> his household." To him his
family was a church in miniature, and he its
priest. Thus too Joshua felt that his service of
God must include family worship.</p>

<p class="dgp">What then is the mission, of the Christian
home? It is two-fold,&mdash;the temporal and eternal
well-being of its members. It is the mission
of home to provide for the temporal well-being
of its members. They are parts of one great
whole. Each must seek the welfare of all the
rest. This involves obedience to the law of co-operation;

and has special reference to that provision
which the heads of families should make
for the wants of those who are placed under
their protection. As the parent sustains a
physical, intellectual and moral relation to the
child, it is his mission to provide for its physical,
mental and moral wants. "He that provideth
not for his own house hath denied the faith, and
is worse than an infidel." Natural affection will
prompt to this. Children are in a state of utter
helplessness. The infant is at the mercy of the
parent. Instinct impels the parent to provide for
its wants. Even the brute does this.</p>

<p class="dgp">That it is a part, therefore, of the home mission
to provide for the physical wants of the dependents
there, is very evident. To refuse to
fulfill it is a crime against nature. This part of
the home-mission includes the education of the
body, by properly unfolding and directing its
powers, and providing it with appropriate nutriment,
raiment and shelter. In a word, we should
make proper provision for the development and
maturity of the physical life of our children.
This is the mission of the parent until the child
is able to provide for itself. This, says Blackstone,
"is a principle of natural law;" and, in
the language of Puffendorf, is "an obligation
laid on parents, not only by nature herself, but
by their own proper act in bringing them into
the world." The laws of the land also command
it. The child has a legal claim upon the parent
for physical sustenance and education.</p>



<p class="dgp">It is another part of the home-mission to provide
for the intellectual wants and welfare of the
child. Children have mind as well as body. The
former needs nourishment and training as well as
the latter. Hence it is as much the mission of
the family to minister to the well-being of the
mind of the child, as to that of its body. Civil
law enforces this. Children have a legal as well
as a natural claim to mental culture. In a word,
it is the home-mission to provide for the child
all things necessary to prepare it for a citizenship
in the state.</p>

<p class="dgp">Parents abuse this mission in two ways, either
when they by their own indolence and dissipation
compel their children to support them; or, on the
other hand, when they become the willing slaves
of their children, labor to amass a fortune for
them, and, in the anticipation of that, permit
them to grow up in ignorance, idleness, and
prodigality, fit only to abuse and spend the fruit
of parental servitude. In this way the misapplied
provision made by parents often becomes a
curse, not only to the members of the family, but
to the state and church.</p>

<p class="dgp">Another part of the home-mission is, the spiritual
and eternal well-being of its members. This
is seen in the typical character of the Christian
family. It is an emblem of the church and of
heaven. According to this, parents are called to
administer the means of grace to their household,
to provide for soul as well as for body, to prepare
the child for a true membership in the church, as

well as for a citizenship in the state, to train for
heaven as well as for earth.</p>

<p class="dgp">Parents are "priests unto their families," and
have the commission to act for them as faithful
stewards of God in all things pertaining to their
everlasting welfare. Their souls, as well as their
bodies, are committed to their trust, and God
says to them,&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Go nurse them for the King of Heaven,</p>
<p class="l">And He will pay thee hire."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is their great mission, and corresponds with
the conception of the Christian home as a spiritual
nursery. The family is "God&#8217;s husbandry;"
and this implies a spiritual culture. As its members
dwell as "being heirs together of the grace
of life," it is the function of each to labor to
make all the rest "fellow-citizens with the saints,
and of the household of God." Parents should
provide for the religious wants of their children.
Mere physical maintenance and mental
culture cannot supersede the necessity of spiritual
training. Children have a right to such
training.</p>

<p class="dgp">This religious provision is twofold; their moral
and spiritual faculties should be developed; and
their moral nature supplied with appropriate nutriment.
All the wants of their moral nature are
to be faithfully provided for. The home-mission
involves the business of education of body, of
mind, and of spirit;&mdash;of preparation for the
state, for the church, for eternity. It is this

which makes it so sacred and responsible. Strip
the Christian family of its mission as a nursery
for the soul; wrest from the parents their high
prerogative as stewards of God; and you heathenize
home, yea, you brutalize it! Tell me,
what Christian home can accomplish its holy
mission, when the soul is neglected, when religion
is left out of view, when training up for God
is abandoned, when the church is repudiated, and
eternity cast off? You may provide for the body
and mind of your children; you may amass for
them a fortune; you may give them an accomplished
education; you may introduce them into
the best society; you may establish them in the
best business; you may fit them for an honorable
and responsible position in life; you may
be careful of their health and reputation; and
you may caress them with all the tender ardor
of the parental heart and hand; yet if you provide
not for their souls; if you seek not their
salvation; if you minister only to their temporal,
and not to their eternal welfare, all will be
vain, yea, a curse both to you and to them.
Husband and wife may love each other, and
live together in all the peace and harmony of
reciprocated affection; yet if the religious part
of their home-mission remain unfulfilled, their
family is divested of its noblest attraction; its
greatest interests will fall into ruin; its highest
destiny will not be attained; and soon its
fruits will be entombed in oblivion; while their
children, neglected and perishing, will look back

upon that home with a bitterness of spirit which
the world can neither soothe nor extract!</p>

<p class="dgp">How many such homes there are! Even the
homes of church members are too often reckless
of their high vocation. Their moral stewardship
is neglected; their dedications, formal and heartless.
No prayers are heard; no bible read; no
instructions given; no pious examples set; no
holy discipline exercised. Their interests, their
hopes and their enjoyments; their education,
their labor and their rest, are all of the world,&mdash;worldly.
The curse of God is upon such a
home!</p>

<p class="dgp">The importance and responsibility of the home-mission
may be seen in its vicarious character, and
in its influence upon the members. The principle
of moral reproduction is manifest in all the
home-relations. What the parent does is reproduced,
as it were, in the child, and will tell upon
the generations that follow them. Those close
affinities by which all the members are allied, give
to each a moulding influence over all the rest.
The parents live, not for themselves alone, but
for their children, and the consequence of such a
life is also entailed upon their offspring. "The
iniquity of the fathers shall be visited upon the
children unto the third and fourth generation."
If the parent "sow to the flesh," the child, with
him, "shall of the flesh reap corruption;" but if
he "sow to the spirit," his offspring, with him,
shall "of the spirit reap life everlasting."</p>

<p class="dgp">Sacred and profane history proves and illustrates

this great truth. Did not God punish
the first born of Israel, because their fathers had
sinned? And is it not a matter of daily observation
that the wickedness of the parent is entailed
upon the child? Such is indeed the affinity between
them that the child cannot, unless by some
special interposition of Providence, escape the
curse of a parent&#8217;s sin. "If one member suffer,
all the members suffer with it."</p>

<p class="dgp">The guilt and condemnation of unfaithfulness
to the home-mission may be inferred from its
importance and responsibility. Those who are
unfaithful are guilty of "blood." We see the
curse of such neglect in that deterioration of
character which so rapidly succeeds parental delinquency.
They must answer before God for
the loss which the soul, the state, and the church
sustain thereby. "It shall be more tolerable for
Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment
than for them."</p>

<p class="dgp">The Christian home should be qualified for
this mission. There can be no such qualification,
however, where the marriage alliance involves
inequality&mdash;one of the parents a Christian,
the other not; for they cannot "dwell together
as heirs of the grace of life," neither can they
effectually dispense that grace to their offspring.
When thus "the house is divided against itself,
it must fall." "Be ye not, therefore, unequally
yoked together." If one draws heavenward and
the other hellward, there will be a halting between
Baal and God, and the influence of the

one will be counteracted by that of the other.
What communion hath light with darkness?
"What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?
What part hath he that believeth
with an infidel?" Thus divided, their
home will be unfit for its high vocation. Hence
parents, in their marriage alliance as well as in
their individual character, should qualify themselves
for the responsible mission of home. Can
the ungodly wife or husband fulfill this mission?
Can the irreligious parent bring up his offspring
"in the nurture and admonition of the Lord?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Many parents disqualify themselves for their
home-mission by devoting too much attention
to society,&mdash;by spending more time abroad, at
parties, theaters and masquerade balls, in gossiping
and recreation, than at home with each
other and with their children. They commit
their children, with all the family interests, to
nurses and servants. They regard their offspring
as mere playthings to be dandled upon the knee,
brought up like calves in the stall, and then
turned out to shape their own destiny.</p>

<p class="dgp">This is a sad mistake! There is no substitute
for home,&mdash;no transfer of a parent&#8217;s commission,
no adequate compensation for a parent&#8217;s loss.
None can effectually take the parent&#8217;s place.
Their influence is overwhelming and absolute.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "With what a kingly power their love</p>
<p class="l">Might rule the fountains of the new-born mind!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Not even the dark villainies which have disgraced

humanity can neutralize it. Gray-haired
and demon guilt will weep in his dismal cell over
the melting, soothing memories of home. Their
impressions are indelible, "like the deep borings
into the flinty rock." To erase them we must
remove every strata of their being. They give
texture and coloring to the whole woof and web
of the child&#8217;s character. The mother especially
preöccupies the unwritten page of its being, and
mingles with it in its cradle dreams, making thus
a deathless impress upon its soul.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The mother in her office, holds the key</p>
<p class="l">Of the soul; and she it is who stamps the coin</p>
<p class="l">Of character, and makes the being who would be a savage</p>
<p class="l">But for her cares, a Christian man!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What a folly and a sin, therefore, for Christian
parents to give over their holy mission to another,
while they immerse themselves in the forbidden
pleasures and recreations of the world! Oh, if
you are loving, faithful parents, you will love the
society of your household more than the fashions
and the fashionable resorts of the world;
you will not substitute the "nurse" and the
"boarding school" for the more efficient ministrations
of the Christian home.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"If ye count society for past time,&mdash;what happier recreation</p>
<p class="l">  than a nursling,</p>
<p class="l">Its winning ways, its prattling tongue, its innocence and mirth?</p>
<p class="l">If ye count society for good,&mdash;how fair a field is here,</p>
<p class="l">To guide these souls to God, and multiply thyself in heaven!"</p>
</div>



<p class="dgp">"Walk, therefore, worthy of the vocation
wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and
meekness." "Magnify your office." Be faithful
to your home-mission. Draw your pleasure
from it. Souls are committed to your trust
and hang upon your hire. Your regard for
the temporal and eternal welfare of your children
should prompt you to faithfulness to the
holy mission of your family. You love your
children, and desire their welfare and happiness.
But do what you will for them, if you
are unfaithful to their souls, you wrest from
them the means of safety and of happiness;
you aid in their misery in this and in the world
to come. You are more cruel to them than
was Herod who slew the bodies of children.
You murder their souls. He murdered the
children of others; you murder your own;
he employed others to do it for him; you do
the work of slaughter yourself! If, then, you
love your children; if their souls are committed
to you; if your unfaithfulness to them may
result in their ruin; if God blesses the holy
mission of your home to their temporal and
eternal welfare; if its fulfillment by you be
"like words spoken in a whispering-gallery,
which, will be heard at the distance of years,
and echoed along the corridors of ages yet to
come;" and if it will prove to them in life
like the lone star to the mariner upon the dark
and stormy sea,&mdash;should you not be faithful to
your home-vocation!</p>



<p class="dgp">Not only so, but your regard for your own
comfort and happiness here and hereafter should
impel you to this faithfulness. Do you love
yourself? Do you regard your own comfort
and welfare? Would you avoid painful solicitude,
bitter reflection, heart-burning remorse,
dreadful foreboding? Then be faithful to the
home-mission. If you are, God will bless you
for it through your children. What a comfort
it will be to you to see them become Christians,
enter the church, and, at their side around the
Lord&#8217;s Table, hold communion with them in the
joys of faith and in the anticipations of heaven!
And should God remove them from you by death,
you will be cheered amidst the agonies of separation
by their dying consolation. The hope of a
speedy reunion with them in heaven would afford
a sweet solace to your bereaved heart.</p>

<p class="dgp">Or should you be taken before them, what a
comfort would they afford you in your last moments!
With the glow of Christian faith and
hope, they would whisper to you the consolations
of the gospel, and bless you for your faithfulness
to them. And when you and they shall
meet at the bar of God, they will rise up and
call you blessed.</p>

<p class="dgp">But, on the other hand, should you neglect
them; and, as a consequence, they grow up in
wickedness and crime; oh, what a source of
withering remorse they would cause you! No
sin more heavily punishes the guilty, and mingles
for him a more bitter cup, than the sin of

parental neglect. What if after the lapse of a
few years, your neglected child be taken from you,
and consigned to the cold grave, think you not that
when you meet it before the bar of God, it will rise
up as a witness against you, and pour down its
curses upon your head!</p>

<p class="dgp">But suppose that child grows up, unprovided
for by you in its early life; and profligacy mark
his pathway, and demon guilt throw its chains
around him in the prison cell; and he trace back
the beginning of his ruin to your unfaithfulness,
oh, with what pungency would the reflection
send the pang of remorse to your soul!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Go ask that musing father, why yon grave</p>
<p class="l">So narrow, and so noteless, might not close</p>
<p class="l">Without a tear?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Because of the bitter and heart-stricken memories
of a neglected, ruined child that slumbers
there!</p>

<p class="dgp">Or suppose that you die before your neglected
children, think you not that the recollection
of your past parental unfaithfulness will
plant thorns in your pillow, and invest with
deeper shades of horror your descent to the
dark valley of death? And oh, when you
meet them before the bar of the avenging
judge, most fearful will be your interview
with them. Tell me, how will you dare to
meet them there, when the voice of their
blood will cry out from the hallowed ground
of home against you! And then, eternity, oh,

eternity! who shall bring out from the secrets
of the eternal world, those awful maledictions
which God has attached to parental unfaithfulness?</p>

<p class="dgp">Provide, therefore, for your family as the
Lord commands. Remember that if you do
not, you "deny the faith and are worse than
an infidel;" and in the day of Judgment "it
shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah
than for you."</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter III.&mdash;Family Religion.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Lo! where yon cottage whitens through the green,</p>
<p class="l">The loveliest feature of a matchless scene;</p>
<p class="l">Beneath its shading elm, with pious fear,</p>
<p class="l">An aged mother draws her children near,</p>
<p class="l">While from the Holy Word, with earnest air,</p>
<p class="l">She teaches them the privilege of prayer.</p>
<p class="l">Look! how their infant eyes with rapture speak;</p>
<p class="l">Mark the flushed lily on the dimpled cheek;</p>
<p class="l">Their hearts are filled with gratitude and love,</p>
<p class="l">Their hopes are centered in a world above!"</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">The Christian home demands a family religion.
This makes it a "household of God."
Without this it is but a "den of thieves." It
is "the one thing needful."</p>

<p class="dgp">What is "family religion?" It is not an exotic,
but is indigenous to the Christian home.
It is not a "new measure," but an essential ingredient
of the home-constitution,&mdash;coëxistent
with home itself. The first family "began to

call upon the name of the Lord;" the first parent
acted as high-priest of God in his family.</p>

<p class="dgp">It is not individual piety as such, not simply
closet devotion, but family service of God,&mdash;religion
taken up in the home-consciousness and life.
Hence a family, and not simply a personal religion.</p>

<p class="dgp">Such religion, we say, is as old as the church.
We find it in Eden, in the tents of the patriarchs
and in the wilderness of the prophets.
We find it in the tent of Abraham in the
plains of Mamre, in the "house" of Moses, in
the "service" of Joshua, in the "offerings"
of Job, and in the palace of David and Solomon.
It is also a prominent feature of the
gospel economy. The commendation bestowed
by Paul upon Timothy, was that "from a child"
he enjoyed the "unfeigned faith" of his mother
Eunice and his grandmother Lois. Paul exhorts
Christians thus: "Rule well your own houses;
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs." The same family religion was
a prominent feature of the homes of the primitive
Christians. With them, every house was a
sanctuary, and every parent a minister in holy
things to its members. The bible was not only a
parlor ornament, but a lamp to their feet and a
guide to their path, used, meditated upon, prayed
over. Says Turtullian of its members, "They
are united in spirit and in flesh; they kneel down
together; they pray and fast together; they teach,
exhort and support each other with gentleness."</p>



<p class="dgp">How, alas! have Christian homes degenerated
since then in family piety! They received
a reviving impulse in the Reformation; yet even
this was meteor-like, and seemed but the transient
glow of some mere natural emotion. The
fire which then flashed so brilliantly upon the
altar of home, has now become taper-like and
sepulchral; and the altar of family religion, like
the altar of Jehovah upon Mt. Carmel, has been
demolished, and forsaken. Only here and there
do we find a Christian home erect and surround
a Christian altar. Parents seem now ashamed
to serve the Lord at home. They have neither
time nor inclination. Upon the subject of religion
they maintain a bashful, sullen, wonderful
silence before their families. They seem to be
impressed with the strange idea that their wives
and children put no confidence in their piety,
(and may they not have reason for it?) and that
it would, therefore, be vain for them to pray, or
exhort their households. "Many walk thus,"
says Paul, "of whom I have told you often, and
now tell you even weeping, that they are the
enemies of the cross of Christ!" Upon them
shall be answered the prayer of Jeremiah, "Oh
Lord, pour out thy fury upon the families that
call not upon thy name!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus, therefore, we see that the Christian
home demands a family religion. The private
devotion of the individual can be no effectual
substitute for it.</p>



<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The parents pair their secret homage,</p>
<p class="l">And offer up to heaven the warm request,</p>
<p class="l">That He who stills the raven&#8217;s clamorous nest,</p>
<p class="l">  And decks the lily fair in flowery pride,</p>
<p class="l">Would, in the way His wisdom sees the best,</p>
<p class="l">  For them and for their little ones provide."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Family religion includes parental bible instruction,
family prayer, and religious education, government,
discipline and example. These involve
the parent&#8217;s position in his household as a prophet,
priest, and king. "Thou shalt teach my words
diligently unto thy children, and talk of them
when thou sittest in thy house."</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Daily let part of Holy Writ be read,</p>
<p class="l">Let as the body, so the soul have bread.</p>
<p class="l">For look! how many souls in thy house be,</p>
<p class="l">With just as many souls God trusteth thee!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus felt and acted our primitive fathers. By
every winning art, they sought to fill their children
with the knowledge of God&#8217;s Word. The
entire range of nursery instruction and amusement
was comprised in scripture pictures and
hieroglyphics. They intermingled religion with
all their home pursuits, and entwined it with
their earliest and purest associations of childhood.
If Christian parents would follow their
example now, in these days of parental delinquency,
we would not behold so many of their
children grow up in religious ignorance and indifference.</p>

<p class="dgp">The same may be said of the family altar and

prayer. A prayerless family is an irreligious,
godless family. Says Henry, "They who daily
pray in their houses do well; they that not only
pray, but read the scriptures, do better; but they
do best of all, who not only pray and read the
scriptures, but sing the praises of God."</p>

<p class="dgp">Besides, the religion of home implies that we
"command our children and household to keep
the way of the Lord,"&mdash;that we "bring them
up in His nurture and admonition," and "train
them up as He would have them go;" and that
in things pertaining to their spiritual welfare we
"go in and out" before them as their pattern
and example, bidding them to "follow us even
as we follow Christ," and living in their midst as
"the living epistles of Christ, known and read"
of them all.</p>

<p class="dgp">Family religion must "show itself by its works"
of Christian charity and benevolence to the poor,
the sick and the distressed. We should "lay by"
a certain amount each year of what God bestows,
for the support of the church and the propagation
of the gospel. Oh, how little do Christians now
give to these benevolent objects! A penurious,
close-fisted, selfish home cannot be a religious
household. Family religion must be reproductive,
must return to God as well as receive from
Him. But as these characteristic features of the
Christian home will be considered hereafter, we
shall not enlarge upon them here. Suffice it to
say that the mission of home demands family religion.
Its interests cannot be secured without it.

Let our homes be divorced from piety, and they
will become selfish, sensual, unsatisfactory, and
unhappy. Piety should always reign in our
homes,&mdash;not only on the Sabbath, but during
the week; not only in sickness and adversity,
but in health and prosperity. It must, if genuine,
inspire and consecrate the minutest interests
and employments of the household. It must appear
in every scene and feeling and look, and in
each heart, as the life, the light, the hope, and
the joy of all the members.</p>

<p class="dgp">The necessity of family religion is seen in the
value of the soul. The soul is the dearest treasure
and the most responsible trust of home.
What shall it profit the family if its members
gain the whole world and lose their own souls?
What would Christian parents give in exchange
for the souls of their little ones? Is it not more
important that they teach them to pray than to
dance, to "seek the kingdom of heaven" than
the enjoyment of "the pleasures of sin for a
season?" Oh, what is home without a title to,
and personal meetness for, that kingdom? It
is a moral waste; its members move in the
putrid atmosphere of vitiated feeling and misdirected
power. Brutal passions become dominant;
we hear the stern voice of parental despotism;
we behold a scene of filial strife and
insubordination; there is throughout a heart-blank.
Domestic life becomes clouded by a
thousand crosses and disappointments; the solemn
realities of the eternal world are cast into

the shade; the home-conscience and feeling become
stultified; the sense of moral duty distorted,
and all the true interests of home appear in a
haze. Natural affection is debased, and love is
prostituted to the base designs of self, and the
entire family, with all its tender cords, ardent
hopes, and promised interests, becomes engulfed
in the vortex of criminal worldliness!</p>

<p class="dgp">But reverse the picture! See what home becomes
with religion as its life and rule. Human
nature is there checked and moulded by the amiable
spirit and lovely character of Jesus. The
mind is expanded, the heart softened, sentiments
refined, passions subdued, hopes elevated, pursuits
ennobled, the world cast into the shade,
and heaven realized as the first prize. The great
want of our intellectual and moral nature is here
met, and home education becomes impregnated
with the spirit and elements of our preparation
for eternity.</p>

<p class="dgp">The relations of home demand family religion.
These are relations of mutual dependence, involving
such close affinity that the good or evil
which befalls one member must in some degree
extend to all the other members. They involve
"helps." Each member becomes an instrument
in the salvation or damnation of the others.
"For what knowest, O wife, whether thou shalt
save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man,
whether thou shalt save thy wife?"&mdash;1 Cor. vii.,
16. "If one member Suffer, all the members
suffer with it." They stimulate each other either

to salvation or to ruin; and hence those children
that go to ruin in consequence of parental unfaithfulness,
will "curse the father that begat
them, the womb that bare them," and the day
they entered their home.</p>

<p class="dgp">Many parents seek to excuse themselves from
the practice of family religion, upon the ground
that they have not the capacity nor the time. If
so, you should not have married. But if you are
Christians, you have the capacity, and you will
take the time.</p>

<p class="dgp">But some are ashamed to begin family religion.
Ashamed of what? of your piety? of your children?
of the true glory and greatness of your
home? Then you are ashamed of Jesus! You
should rather blush that you have not begun this
good work.</p>

<p class="dgp">The great defect of family religion in the present
day is, that it is not educational. Parents
wait until their children have grown up, and
established habits of sin, when they suppose that
the efforts of some "protracted meeting" will
compensate for their neglect in childhood. They
overlook the command of God to teach them
His words. The influence of this defect and delusion
has been most destructive. Many Christian
homes are now altogether destitute of religious
appliances. If the angel that visited the
homes of Israel were to visit the Christian homes
of this age, would he not be tempted to say, as
Abraham said to Abimelech, "Surely the fear of
God is not in this place!"</p>



<p class="dgp">One great reason, perhaps, why there are so
many such homes is, that there are now so many
irreligious marriages, where husband and wife are
"unequally yoked together," one a believer and
the other not. "How can two walk together except
they be agreed?" Can there be family religion
when husband and wife are traveling to
eternity in opposite roads? No! There will be
hindrances instead of "helps." If they marry
not "in the Lord," religion will not be in their
home. Says the pious Jay, "I am persuaded
that it is very much owing to the prevalence of
these indiscriminate and unhallowed connections,
that we have fallen so far short of those men of
God, who are gone before us, in the discharge of
family worship, and in the training up of our
households in the nurture and admonition of the
Lord."</p>

<p class="dgp">Family religion is implied in the marriage relation
and obligation. It is included in the necessities
of our children, and in the covenant promises
of God. The penalties of its neglect, and the rewards
of our faithfulness to it, should prompt us
to its establishment in our homes. Its absence is
a curse; its presence a blessing. It is a foretaste
of heaven. Like manna, it will feed our souls,
quench our thirst, sweeten the cup of life, and
shed a halo of glory and of gladness around our
firesides. Let yours, therefore, be the religious
home; and then be sure that God will delight to
dwell therein, and His blessing will descend, like
the dews of heaven, upon it. Your children shall

"not be found begging bread," but shall be like
"olive plants around your table,"&mdash;the "heritage
of the Lord." Yours will be the home of love
and harmony; it shall have the charter of family
rights and privileges, the ward of family interests,
the palladium of family hopes and happiness.
Your household piety will be the crowning
attribute of your peaceful home,&mdash;the "crown of
living stars" that shall adorn the night of its tribulation,
and the pillar of cloud and of fire in its
pilgrimage to a "better country." It shall strew
the family threshold with the flowers of promise,
and enshrine the memory of loved ones gone before,
in all the fragrance of that "blessed hope"
of reunion in heaven which looms up from a
dying hour. It shall give to the infant soul its
"perfect flowering," and expand it in all the fullness
of a generous love and conscious blessedness,
making it "lustrous in the livery of divine knowledge."
And then in the dark hour of home separation
and bereavement, when the question is put
to thee, mourning parents, "Is it well with the
child? is it well with thee?" you can answer with
joy, "It is well!"</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter IV&mdash;The Relation Of Home To The Church.</h2>

<p class="noindent">The Christian home sustains a direct relation to
the church. This relation is similar to that which
it sustains to the state. The nature and mission
of home demand the church. The former is the
adumbration of the latter. The one is in the
other. "Greet the church that is in thine house."
The church was in the house of Aquila and Priscilla,
in the tent of Abraham, and in the palace of
David. It must be in every Christian home, and
every Christian home must be in the church. In
a word, our families must be churchly.</p>

<p class="dgp">This relation is vital and necessary,&mdash;a relation
of mutual dependence. The family is a preparation
for the church, subordinate to it, and must,
therefore, throw its influence in its favor, be
moulded by it, and labor With direct reference
to the church in the way of training up for membership
in it. As the civil and political relations
of home involve the duty of parents to train up
their children for efficient citizenship in the state,

so its moral and religious relations involve the
duty of education for the church. Hence the
Christian home is churchly in its spirit, religion,
education, influence, and mission.</p>

<p class="dgp">Family religion is an element of home, not only
as a mere fact or principle in its subjective form,
but in the form and force of the church. In its
unchurchly form it is powerless. It must be experienced
and administered in a churchly spirit
and way, not as something detached from the
organic embodiment of Christianity. The relation
of the church to the family forbids this.
The church pervades all the forms of society. It
includes the home and the state. It gives to each
proper vitality, legitimate principles, proper direction,
and a true destiny.</p>

<p class="dgp">But home is not only a preparation for the
church, but completes itself in the church,&mdash;never
out of the church. By the "mystery"
of marriage and the sacrament of holy baptism,
home and the church are bound up into each
other by indissoluble bonds. The one receives
the mark and superscription of the other; the
one is the type or emblem of the other.</p>

<p class="dgp">The church, through her ordinances, ministry
and means of grace, is brought directly "into the
house," and operates there constantly as a spiritual
leaven. It is the purpose of God that our
homes be entrenched within the sacred enclosures
of His church. The former, in its relation to the
latter, is like "a wheel within a wheel,"&mdash;one of
the parts which make up the great machinery of

the kingdom of grace, operating harmoniously
and in its place with all the rest, and for the
same end. The former is built upon the latter,&mdash;receives
her dedication and sanctity from it.
They are correlatives. The one demands the
other. Hence they cannot be divorced. The
individual passes over to the church through the
Christian home. The one is the step to the
other. They have the same foundation. Home
is not erected upon a quicksand, but reared upon
the same rock upon which the church is built.
Like the church, it rises superior to all the fluctuations
of civil society, and will live and flourish
in all its tender charities, in all its sweet enjoyments,
and in all its moral force, in the humble
cottage as well as in the costly palace, under the
shadow of liberty as well as under the frowns of
despotism, in every nation, age, and clime. Like
the church of which it is the type, it can never
be made desolate; break it up on earth, and you
find it in heaven. Its nuptial union with the
church is like that between the latter and Christ.
Nothing can throw over our homes a higher sanctity,
or invest them with greater beauty, or be to
them a greater bulwark of strength, than the
church. Home is the nursery of the church.
"Those who are planted in the house of the
Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God,
and shall bring forth fruit in old age."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus, therefore, we see that the relation between
the Christian home and the church is one
of mutual dependence. The latter, as the highest

form of religious association, demands the
former, and the former looks to the latter as its
completion. Where the religion of the family
does not move in the element of the church, it is
at best but sentimentalism on the one hand, and
rationalism on the other. It is a spurious pietism.
To be genuine it must be moulded by the church.
Without this it is destitute of sterling principle,
of a living-faith, of well-directed effort and lofty
aims. The family which does not move in the
element of the church is a perversion of the true
purpose of God in its institution. It will afford
no legitimate development of Christian doctrine,
and the whole scheme of its religion will rest for
its execution upon unreliable agencies extraneous
to home itself. Hence we find that the piety of
those families or individuals that isolate themselves
from the church, is at best but ephemeral
in its existence, contracted in spirit, moving and
operating by mere impulse and irregular starts,
and withal destitute of vitality and saving influence.
A death-bed scene may awaken a transient
and visionary sense of duty; adversity may startle
the drowsy ear, and cause the parents to turn for
the time to the souls of their children; but these
continue only while the tear and the wound are
fresh, and the apprehensions of the eternal world
are moving in their terrible visions before them!</p>

<p class="dgp">The efficacy of the Christian home, therefore,
depends upon its true relation to the church.
The members should be conscious of this. Then
both parents and children Will appreciate the religious

ministrations of home. Then the former
will not grow weary in well doing, but will have
something to rest upon, something to look to;
and the latter will love the church of their fathers,
and venerate the family as its nursery.</p>

<p class="dgp">But the relation between the Christian home
and the church implies reciprocal obligations and
duties. The former should not only exist under
the patronage of the latter, but in the spirit of a
true subordination. Parents should teach and
rule and appropriate the means of grace under
the supervision of the church. They should take
their household, with them to her public service,
send their children to her schools, and in all respects
bring them up in her nurture and admonition.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus the family should exist as the faithful
daughter of the church; and as the latter in the
wilderness "leaned upon her beloved," so the
former should repose itself upon her who is "the
mother of us all," and in whom, as the "body of
Christ," shall "all the families of the earth be
blessed." As her loving and confiding daughter,
the family should live under her government and
discipline, listen to her maternal voice, and be led
by her maternal hand. The minister in his pastoral
functions, is the representative of the church
in each of the families of his flock; and should,
therefore, be received, loved, confided in and
obeyed, as such. The home that repels his proffered
ministrations in the name and according to
the will of the church, throws off its allegiance to

the latter, and through it, to Christ,&mdash;her glorious
head, and is hence unworthy of the name of
Christian home. The true Christian home yearns
after the church, loves to lean upon it, to look up
to it, to consecrate all to it, to move and develop
its interests in the sphere of the church, and to
labor to complete itself in it.</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter V&mdash;Home Influence.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"By the soft green light in the woody glade,</p>
<p class="l">On the banks of moss, where thy childhood play&#8217;d;</p>
<p class="l">By the gathering round the winter hearth,</p>
<p class="l">When the twilight call&#8217;d unto household mirth,</p>
<p class="l">By the quiet hour when hearts unite</p>
<p class="l">In the parting prayer and the kind &#8217;Good night;&#8217;</p>
<p class="l">By the smiling eye and the loving tone,</p>
<p class="l">Over thy life has the spell been thrown,</p>
<p class="l">And bless that gift, it hath gentle might,</p>
<p class="l">A guarding power and a guiding light!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Christian home has an influence which is
stronger than death. It is a law to our hearts,
and binds us with, a spell which neither time nor
change can break. The darkest villainies which
have disgraced humanity cannot neutralize it.
Gray-haired and demon guilt will make his dismal
cell the sacred urn of tears wept over the
memories of home; and these will soften and
melt into penitence even the heart of adamant.</p>

<p class="dgp" style="text-align: center"><img src="images/image2.png" alt="Maternal Influence"><br />Maternal Influence</p>

<p class="dgp">The home-influence is either a blessing or a
curse, either for good or for evil. It cannot be
neutral. In either case it is mighty, commencing

with our birth, going with us through life, clinging
to us in death, and reaching into the eternal
world. It is that unitive power which arises out
of the manifold relations and associations of domestic
life. The specific influences of husband
and wife, of parent and child, of brother and
sister, of teacher and pupil, united and harmoniously
blended, constitute the home-influence.</p>

<p class="dgp">From this we may infer the character of home-influence.
It is great, silent, irresistible, and permanent.
Like the calm, deep stream, it moves
on in silent, but overwhelming power. It strikes
its roots deep into the human heart, and spreads
its branches wide over our whole being. Like
the lily that braves the tempest, and "the Alpine
flower that leans its cheek on the bosom of eternal
snows," it is exerted amid the wildest storms
of life, and breathes a softening spell in our
bosom even when a heartless world is freezing
up the fountains of sympathy and love. It is
governing, restraining, attracting and traditional.
It holds the empire of the heart, and rules the
life. It restrains the wayward passions of the
child, and checks him in his mad career of ruin.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Hold the little hands in prayer, teach the weak knees their kneeling,</p>
<p class="l">Let him see thee speaking to thy God; he will not forget it afterward;</p>
<p class="l">When old and gray, will he feelingly remember a mother&#8217;s tender piety,</p>
<p class="l">And the touching recollection of her prayers shall arrest the strong man in his sin!"</p>
</div>



<p class="dgp">Home-influence is traditional. It passes down
the current of life from one generation to another.
Its continuity is preserved from first to
last. The homes of our forefathers rule us even
now, and will pass from us to our children&#8217;s children.
Hence it has been called the "fixed capital"
of home. It keeps up a continuous stream
of home-life and feeling and interest. Hence the
family likeness, moral as well as physical,&mdash;the
family virtues and vices,&mdash;coming from the family
root and rising into all the branches, and developing
in all the elements of the family history.</p>

<p class="dgp">Home-influence is attractive. It draws us to
home, and throws a spell around our existence,
which we have not the power to break.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The holy prayer from my thoughts hath pass&#8217;d,</p>
<p class="l">The prayer at my mother&#8217;s knee&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Darken&#8217;d and troubled I come at last,</p>
<p class="l">Thou home of my boyish glee!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Home-influence may he estimated from the immense
force of first impressions. It is the prerogative
of home to make the first impression
upon our nature, and to give that nature its first
direction onward and upward. It uncovers the
moral fountain, chooses its channel, and gives
the stream its first impulse. It makes the "first
stamp and sets the first seal" upon the plastic
nature of the child. It gives the first tone to
our desires, and furnishes ingredients that will
either sweeten or embitter the whole cup of life.
These impressions are indelible, and durable as

life. Compared with them, other impressions are
like those made upon sand or wax. These are
like "the deep borings into the flinty rock." To
erase them we must remove every strata of our
being. Even the infidel lives under the holy influence
of a pious mother&#8217;s impressions. John
Randolph could never shake off the restraining
influence of a little prayer his mother taught him
when a child. It preserved him from the clutches
of avowed infidelity.</p>

<p class="dgp">The promises of God bear testimony to the
influence of the Christian home. "When he
grows old he will not depart from it!" History
confirms and illustrates this. Look at those
scenes of intemperance and riot, of crime and
of blood, which throw the mantle of infamy
over human life! Look at your prisons, your
hospitals, and your gibbets; go to the gaming-table
and the rum-shop. Tell me, who are those
that are there? What is their history? Where
did they come from? From the faithful Christian
home? Had they pious fathers and mothers?
Did they go to these places under the holy influence
of devout and faithful parents? No! And
who are they that are dying without hope and
without God? Who are they that now throng
the regions of the damned? Those who were
"trained up in the way they should go?" No!
if they are, then the promises of God must fail.
You may perhaps find a few such. But these are
exceptions to a general law. The damning influence
of their unfaithful home brought them there.

Could they but speak to us from their chambers
of wo, we should hear them pouring out curses
upon their parents, and ascribing the cause of
their ruin to their neglect. On the other hand,
could we but listen to the anthems of the redeemed
in heaven, we should doubtless hear sentiments
of gratitude for a mother&#8217;s prayer and a
father&#8217;s counsel.</p>

<p class="dgp">Let us now briefly advert to the objects of
home-influence. It is exerted upon the members
of home, especially upon the formation of
their character and destiny. It moulds their
character. The parents assimilate their children
to themselves to such an extent that we can judge
the former by the latter. Lamartine says that,
when he wants to know a woman&#8217;s character, he
ascertains it by an inspection of her home,&mdash;that
he judges the daughter by the mother. His judgment
rests upon the known influence the latter
has over the former. It gives texture and coloring
to the whole woof and web of character. It
forms the head and the heart, moulds the affections,
the will and the conscience, and throws
around our entire nature the means and appliances
of its development for good or for evil.
Every word, every incident, every look, every
lesson of home, has its bearing upon our life.
Had one of these been omitted, our lives would
perhaps be different. One prayer in our childhood,
was perhaps the lever that raised us from
ruin. One omission of parental duty may result
in the destruction of the child. What an influence

home exerts upon our faith! Most of our
convictions and opinions rest upon home-teaching
and faith. A minister was once asked, "Do you
not believe christianity upon its evidences?" He
replied, "No; I believe it because my mother
taught me!"</p>

<p class="dgp">The same may be said of its influence upon
our sympathies, and in the formation of habits.
It draws us by magnetic power to home, and develops
in us all that which is included in home-feeling
and home-sickness.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"I need but pluck yon garden flower,</p>
<p class="l">  From where the wild weeds rise,</p>
<p class="l">To wake with strange and sudden power,</p>
<p class="l">  A thousand sympathies!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In this respect how irresistible is the influence of
a mother&#8217;s love and kindness! Her very name
awakens the torpid streams of life, gives a fresh
glow to the tablets of memory, and fills our hearts
with a deep gush of consecrated feeling.</p>

<p class="dgp">Our habits, too, are formed under the moulding
power of home. The "tender twig" is there
bent, the spirit shaped, principles implanted, and
the whole character is formed until it becomes a
habit. Goodness or evil are there "resolved into
necessity." Who does not feel this influence of
home upon all his habits of life? The gray-haired
father who wails in his second infancy, feels the
traces of his childhood-home in his spirit, desires
and habits. Ask the strong man in the prime of
life, whether the most firm and reliable principles

of his character were not the inheritance of the
parental home. What an influence the teaching&#8217;s
and prayers of his mother Monica had upon
the whole character of the pious Augustine! The
sterling worth of Washington is a testimony to
the formative power of parental instruction. John
Quincy Adams, even when his eloquence thundered
through our legislative halls, and caused a nation
to startle from her slumber, bent his aged
form before God, and repeated the prayer of his
childhood. "How often in old age," says Bishop
Hall, "have I valued those divine passages of experimental
divinity that I heard from the lips of a
mother!" Dr. Doddridge ever lived under the influence
of those scripture instructions his mother
gave him from the Dutch tiles of her fireside.
He says, "these lessons were the instruments of
my conversion." "Generally," says Dr. Cumming,
"when, there is a Sarah in the house, there
will be an Isaac in the cradle; wherever there is a
Eunice teaching a Timothy the scriptures from a
child, there will be a Timothy teaching the gospel
to the rest of mankind." By the force of this
same influence, the pious wife may win over to
Christ her ungodly husband, and the godly child
may save the unbelieving parent. "Well," said a
mother one day weeping, "I will resist no longer!
How can I bear to see my dear child love and read
the scriptures, while I never look into the bible,&mdash;to
see her retire and seek God, while I never pray,&mdash;to
see her going to the Lord&#8217;s table, while His
death is nothing to me! I know she is right, and

I am wrong. I ought to have taught her; but I
am sure she has taught me. How can I bear to
see her joining the church of God, and leaving me
behind&mdash;perhaps forever!"</p>

<p class="dgp">The Christian home has its influence also upon
the state. It forms the citizen, lays the foundation
for civil and political character, prepares the
social element and taste, and determines our national
prosperity or adversity. We owe to the
family, therefore, what we are as a nation as well
as individuals. We trace this influence in the
pulpit, on the rostrum, in the press, in our civil
and political institutions. It is written upon the
scroll of our national glory.</p>

<p class="dgp">The most illustrious statesmen, the most distinguished
warriors, the most eloquent ministers, and
the greatest benefactors of human kind, owe their
greatness to the fostering influence of home. Napoleon
knew and felt this when he said, "What
France wants is good mothers, and you may be
sure then that France will have good sons." The
homes of the American revolution made the men
of the revolution. Their influence reaches yet
far into the inmost frame and constitution of our
glorious republic. It controls the fountains of
her power, forms the character of her citizens and
statesmen, and shapes our destiny as a people.
Did not the Spartan mother and her home give
character to the Spartan nation? Her lessons to
her child infused the iron nerve into the heart
of that nation, and caused her sons, in the wild
tumult of battle, "either to live behind their

shields, or to die upon them!" Her influence
fired them with a patriotism which was stronger
than death. Had it been hallowed by the pure
spirit and principles of Christianity, what a power
for good it would have been!</p>

<p class="dgp">But alas! the home of an Aspasia had not the
heart and ornaments of the Christian family.
Though "the monuments of Cornelia&#8217;s virtues
were the character of her children," yet these
were not "the ornaments of a quiet spirit."
Had the central heart of the Spartan home
been that of the Christian mother, the Spartan
nation would now perhaps adorn the brightest
page of history.</p>

<p class="dgp">But the family, whether Christian or heathen,
exerts an overwhelming influence over the state.
It is on the family altar that the fire of patriotism
is first kindled, and often, too, by a mother&#8217;s hand.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"It hath led the freeman forth to stand</p>
<p class="l">In the mountain battles of his land;</p>
<p class="l">It hath brought the wanderer o&#8217;er the seas,</p>
<p class="l">To die on the hills of his own fresh breeze."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The same, too, may be said of the influence of
home on the church. It is the nursery of the
church, lays the foundation of her membership,
and conditions the character of her members.
The most faithful of her ministers and members
are those generally who have been trained up in
the most faithful families. Wherever there is the
greatest number of such homes, there the church
enjoys the greatest prosperity.</p>



<p class="dgp">What a fearful responsibility must rest, therefore
upon the Christian home! If its influence
is for good or for evil, for weal or for woe, for
heaven or for hell; if it is either a powerful emissary
of Satan for the soul&#8217;s destruction, or an efficient
agent of God for the soul&#8217;s salvation, then
how responsible are those who wield this influence!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Upon thy heart is laid a spell,</p>
<p class="l">Holy and precious&mdash;oh! guard it well!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Are you not, Christian parents, responsible to
God for the exercise of such sovereign power
over the character and well-being of your dear
children? And will not the day soon come when
you must "give an account of your stewardship?"
Oh! what if it be exerted for the ruin
of your loved ones, and they "curse the day you
begat them?" What if, in the day of final reckoning,
you find your hands drenched in the blood
of your offspring, and hear the voice of that blood
cry out from the hallowed ground of home against
you, saying, "How long, oh Lord, holy and true,
dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them
that dwell on earth?" Oh see, then, that your influence
be wielded for good.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"For round the heart thy power hast spun</p>
<p class="l">  A thousand dear mysterious ties;</p>

<p class="noindent">The Christian home is a stewardship. The parents
are stewards of God. A steward is a servant
of a particular kind, to whom the master commits
a certain portion of his interest to be prosecuted
in his name and by his authority, and according
to his laws and regulations. The steward must act
according to the will of his master, in his dealing
with what is committed to his care. Such was
Eliezer in the house of Abraham; and such was
Joseph in the house of Potiphar. One of the specific
duties of a steward was to dispense portions
of food to the different members of the household,
to give servants their portion in due season, and to
superintend the general interests of the master&#8217;s
household.</p>



<p class="dgp">In a religious sense, a steward is a minister of
Christ, whose duty is to dispense the provisions
of the gospel, to preach its doctrines and to administer
its ordinances. It is required of such
that they be found faithful.&mdash;1 Cor., chap. iv.</p>

<p class="dgp">In its application to the Christian home, it expresses
its relation of subordination to God, and
the kind of services which the former must render
to the latter. The stewardship of home is that
official character with which God has invested the
family. In this sense the proprietorship of parents
is from God. They are invested only with delegated
authority. Their home is held by them only
in trust. It belongs to them in the same sense in
which a household belongs to a steward. It is not
at their absolute disposal. It is the "household of
the Lord," and they are to live and rule therein as
the Lord directs. They are to appropriate it and
dispose of its interests according to the known law
and will of their divine Master, and in this sense,
yield, with their whole household, a voluntary subordination
to His authority.</p>

<p class="dgp">As a stewardship, God has entrusted the Christian
home with important interests. He has committed
to her trust, body and soul, talents and
means of grace. He has entrusted to the parents
the training of their children both for time and
for eternity. These children are the heritage of
the Lord; they are not at the absolute disposal
of their parents; but merely entrusted to their
care to be educated and dealt with according to
the will of God.</p>



<p class="dgp">There is one great peculiarity in this stewardship
of the Christian family,&mdash;the absolute identity
of interest between the Master and the steward.
The interest of the former is that also of the
latter; and the latter, in promoting the interest of
his Lord, is but advancing his own welfare. Such
is the economy of the gospel, and it is this which
makes the servitude of the Christian so delightful.
Faithfulness to God is faithfulness to our
own souls. Parents who are thus faithful to God
must be faithful to themselves and to their children.
Thus, then, the interest of God in our families
is the welfare of all the members. When
we act towards our children as God directs, we
are but promoting their greatest welfare. This
is one prominent feature of God&#8217;s mercy towards
us in all His dealings with us. He identifies His
interest with the interest of His people. This is
a powerful incentive to parental integrity, and is
beautifully exemplified in the mother of Moses.
When the daughter of Pharaoh said to her, "Take
this child and nurse it for me, and I will pay thee
thy wages," was not the interest of the queen
and the nurse the same? In nursing him for the
queen, that devoted mother nursed him also for
herself; and in doing this, she was also promoting
the welfare of her son, and executing the will
of God concerning him. This illustrates the principle
of stewardship in the Christian home. Of
every child, God says to its parent,&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Go nurse it for the King of heaven,</p>
<p class="l">And He will pay thee hire."</p>
</div>



<p class="dgp">Here is the important trust; here, too, is the duty
of the steward. It is a trust from God, and the
nursing is for God. The child is a tender plant,
an invaluable treasure, more priceless than gold,
or pearls, or diamonds. Your duty as a steward, is
to nurse it, to cultivate it, to polish the lovely gem,
to take care of it. And in doing this for God, are
you not also doing it for the child,&mdash;yea, if you
are Christian parents,&mdash;for yourselves? Will not
even natural affection, as well as the discerning
eye of faith, like that of the mother of Moses,
detect in this stewardship an identity between
the interest of the Master and that of the steward?
It was not the simple compensation which
stimulated the mother of Moses to accede to the
proposition of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter. What cared
she for the "hire," if she could but save her son!
This was her great reward.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus the interest of the child should be the
reward of the parent. God will, it is true, reward
the faithful steward of the family; but He
specially rewards and blesses parental faithfulness
in making His purposes concerning home,
identical with the parent&#8217;s and the children&#8217;s welfare.
In this domestic stewardship,</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Like warp and woof, all interests</p>
<p class="l">Are woven fast;</p>
<p class="l">Locked in sympathy like the keys</p>
<p class="l">Of an organ vast."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father&#8217;s
good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Who,

then, is that faithful and wise steward whom his
Lord shall make ruler over his household, to
give them their portion of meat in due season?
Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He
cometh, shall find so doing. Of a truth I say
unto you, that He will make him ruler over all
he hath. But and if that servant say in his heart,
my Lord delayeth His coming, and shall begin
to beat the men-servants and maidens, and to eat
and drink, and to be drunken; the Lord of that
servant will come in a day when he looketh not
for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and
will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his
portion with the unbelievers. And that servant
which knew his Lord&#8217;s will and prepared not
himself, neither did according to His will, shall
be beaten with many stripes."</p>

<p class="dgp">Here, then, we have the character and duties
of the steward in the Christian home, the rewards
of their faithfulness, and the penalties of
their unfaithfulness. As the stewards of God,
we must be faithful, giving the souls as well as
the bodies of our children "their meat in due
season;" we must not "waste the goods" of our
Lord, but be "blameless, not self-willed, not soon
angry, not given to filthy lucre, but a lover of
hospitality, sober, just, holy, temperate, holding
fast the faithful word as we have been taught."
As the faithful stewards of God, we should dedicate
our household in all respects to Him, and
make it tributary to His glory. "Seek ye first
the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall

be added unto you." The unjust steward will
first seek the world and the things of the world,
its gold, its pleasures and its honors; and after
that seek the kingdom of heaven. But this is
reversing the order of procedure as prescribed
by the Master; it is running counter to His will,
and, consequently, wasting His goods.</p>

<p class="dgp">But the greatest trust committed to parents is,
the souls of their children; and hence their most
responsible duty, as the stewards of God, is to attend
to their salvation. You should "give them
the bread of life in due season." It will be of
no avail for you to inquire, "What shall they eat,
and what shall they drink, and wherewithal shall
they be clothed;" if you neglect this their highest
interest and your greatest trust? "What shall
a man give in exchange for his soul?" It is not
the wealth, nor the magnificence of life which
will make your home happy; these are but the
outward and fleeting ornaments of the world, and
are too often the gaudy drapery in which demon
guilt and misery are clothed.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The cobwebbed cottage, with its ragged wall</p>
<p class="l">Of mouldering mud, is royalty to me,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">if souls are there "fed upon the sincere milk of
the word," and "trained up in the ways of the
Lord." The training of the soul for heaven
is both the duty and the glory of our homes.
What if parents lay up affluence here for their
children, and secure for them all that the world
calls interest, while they permit their souls to

famish, and do nothing for their redemption!
Will not such parents be denounced in the day
of judgment as unjust and unfaithful stewards?
And yet alas! how many such Christian parents
there are who prostitute this highest interest of
home either at the altar of mammon or of fashion!
The precious time and talents with which
God has entrusted them, they squander away in
things of folly and of sin, leaving their children
to grow up in spiritual ignorance and wickedness,
while they resort to balls and theaters and
masquerades, in pursuit of unhallowed amusement
and pleasure.</p>

<p class="dgp">Such are unnatural parents as well as unjust
stewards, and their homes will ere long be made
desolate. Other parents prostitute the holy trust
of home to money. They are "self-willed" stewards,
"given to filthy lucre," who, for the sake of a
few dollars, will "waste the goods" of their Lord,
make their homes a drudgery, and work their
children like their horses, bring them up in ignorance,
like "calves in the stall," and contract their
whole existence, and all their capacities, desires
and hopes, in the narrow compass of work and
money.</p>

<p class="dgp">We would direct the attention of such parents
to our last thought upon the stewardship of the
Christian home, (the practical view of which we
shall consider in the next chapter,) viz., that it
involves the principle of accountability. It implies
a settlement, a time when the Master and
his steward shall meet together to close accounts.

"Give an account of thy stewardship; for thou
mayest be no longer steward." That time will
be when "the dead, both small and great, shall
stand before God." Then He will examine into
your stewardship. He will ask you how you employed
your talents, and to what purpose you appropriated
those interests He committed to your
trust; and whether you were faithful to those
souls which "hung upon your hire;" whether
you "nursed them for him," and whether you
provided them with "their meat in due season."
And if you can answer, "Yea, Lord, here are
those talents which thou hast given me; behold
I have gained for thee five other talents. Here,
Lord, are those children whom thou hast given
me; I have brought them up in thy nurture, and
trained them in thy ways." Your Lord will then
answer, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant,
thou hast been faithful over a few things;
behold I will make thee ruler over many things;
enter thou into the joy of thy Lord!"</p>

<p class="dgp">But if you have been unfaithful as stewards,
and have made your household unproductive for
God, then you shall hear from his lips the dreadful
denunciation, "Thou wicked and slothful servant!"
"Take the talent from him, and cast
ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness;
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth;
for unto every one that hath shall be given, and
he shall have abundance; but from him that hath
not shall be taken away even that which he hath!"</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter VII&mdash;Responsibilities Of The Christian Home.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "What a holy charge</p>
<p class="l">Is theirs!&mdash;with what a kingly power their love</p>
<p class="l">Might rule the fountains of the new-born mind!</p>
<p class="l">Warn them to wake at early dawn, and sow</p>
<p class="l">Good seed before the world has sown its tares."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">From the potent influence and moral stewardship
of the Christian home, we may infer its
responsibility. The former is the argument for
the latter. The extent of the one is the measure
of the other. "To whom much is given, of them
much will be required." Our responsibilities are
thus commensurate with our abilities. If the
latter are properly devoted, we have our reward;
if not, our curse. God will hold us accountable
for the achievements we make by the abilities he
has given us. If he gives us a field to cultivate,
seed to sow, plants to train up, then we are responsible
for the harvest, just in proportion to our
agency in its production. If there is not a harvest
of the right kind, because we neglected to

cultivate the soil, to sow the proper seed, and to
train up the plants, then He will hold, us accountable,
and "we shall not come out thence till we
have paid the uttermost farthing."</p>

<p class="dgp">This is an evident gospel principle. Who will
doubt its application to the Christian home? The
family is such a field; the seed of good or evil the
parents can sow therein; their children are young
and tender plants, entrusted to their care; their
mission from God is to "bring them up in his
nurture" and to "train them in his ways." And
where God gives the command, he also gives the
power to obey.</p>

<p class="dgp">If, then, by their neglect, these tender plants
are blighted, grow up in the crooked ways of folly
and iniquity, and the leprosy of sin spread its
dreadful infection over all the posterity of home;
if, as a consequence of their unfaithfulness, the
family becomes a moral desolation, and the anathemas
of unnumbered souls in perdition, rise up in
the day of judgment against them; or if, on the
other hand, as the fruit of their faithful stewardship,
blessings and testimonials of gratitude are
now pouring forth from the sainted loved ones in
glory, is it not plain that a responsibility rests upon
the Christian home, commensurate with, those
abilities which God has given her, and with those
interests he has entrusted to her care?</p>

<p class="dgp">Let us look at the objective force of this. The
family is responsible for the kind of influence she
exerts upon her members Look at this in its
practical light. There is a family. God has

given children to the parents. How fondly they
cling to them, and look up to them for support
and direction. They inherit from their parents a
predisposition to evil or to good; they imitate
them as their example, in all things, take their
word as the law of life, and follow in their footsteps
as the sure path to happiness. These
parents are members of the church, and, as such,
have dedicated their children to the Lord at the
altar of baptism, and there in the presence of God
and a witnessing assembly, they vowed to bring
them up in the nurture of their divine Master,
and to minister in spiritual things to their souls.</p>

<p class="dgp">Yet in this home, no prayer is offered up, no
bible instructions given, no holy example set, no
Christian government and discipline instituted, no
religious interests promoted. But on the other
hand, sin is overlooked, winked at, and the world
alone sought. These children behold their parents
toil day after day to provide for their natural life;
they notice the interest they take in their health
and education, and the self-denial with which
they seek to secure for them a temporal competency.
And from all this they quickly and very
justly infer that their parents love their bodies
and value this world, and by the force of filial
imitation they soon learn to do the same, and
with their parents, neglect their souls and kneel
at the altars of Mammon rather than bow in
prayer before God. And thus they go on from
one step in departure from God to another, until
they die without hope and without salvation.</p>



<p class="dgp">Tell me now, will not God hold these parents
responsible for the ruin of their children? Will
not the "blood of their destruction rest upon
them?" Will not the "voice of that blood" cry
out from their family against them? If, as a consequence
of their negligence and of the unholy
influence they exerted upon them, they become
desperadoes in crime and villainy, and at last
drench their hands in a brother&#8217;s blood; and expiate
their guilt upon the gibbet, and from there
go down to the grave of infamy and to the hell
of the murderer, will not their blood, "cry unto
them," and will not the woes and anathemas of
Almighty God come in upon them like a flood?</p>

<p class="dgp">Home-responsibility may be inferred from the
relation of the family to God as a stewardship.
We have seen that parents are stewards of God in
their household, and that as such they are placed
over their children, invested with delegated authority.
God entrusts them to the care of their
parents. Their nature is pliable, fit for any impression,
exposed to sin and ruin, entering upon
a course of life which must terminate in eternal
happiness or misery, with bodies to develop, minds
to educate, hearts to mould, volitions to direct,
habits to form, energies to rule, pursuits to follow,
interests to secure, temptations to resist, trials to
endure, souls to save! Oh, how the parental heart
must swell with emotions too big for utterance,
when they contemplate these features of their important
trust. What a mission this, to superintend
the character and shape the destiny of such

a being! Such is the plastic power you exert
upon it, that upon your guidance will hinge its
weal or its woe; and yours, therefore, will be the
lasting benefit or the lasting shame. What you
are now doing for your children is incorporated
with their very being, and will be as imperishable
as their undying souls. As the stewards of God,
your provision for them will be "either a savor
of life unto life or a savor of death unto death."</p>

<p class="dgp">We have seen that God has given to you the
ability and means of making them subservient to
his glory; and hence from you he will require
them as entrusted talents. If you have been unfaithful
to them, your punishment will be in proportion
to the wretchedness entailed upon your
children. If, instead of the bread from heaven,
you feed their souls with the husks of life,
and lead them on by the opiates of bastard joys;
if, "when they ask of you bread, you give them a
stone, or for a fish, you give them a serpent," will
it not be "more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah
in the day of judgment than for you?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus, therefore, you see, christian parents,
how your responsibility is measured, by the magnitude
of those interests committed to your care,
by the kind of influence you exert over them,
and by the enormity of that guilt and wo which
are consequent upon your unfaithfulness. Let
this be an incentive to parental integrity. The
day is rapidly approaching when you must give
an account of your stewardship. Oh, what, if
in that day you behold your children "fit for the

eternal burning," and remember that that fitness
is but the impress of a parent&#8217;s hand!</p>

<p class="dgp">Though it is painful to lose a child here; bitter
tears are shed; pungent agonies are felt;
there are heart-burnings kindled over the grave
of buried love. But oh, how much more agonizing
it is to bend over the dying bed of an impenitent,
ruined child! And especially if, in that
terrible moment, he turns his eyes, wild with
despair and ominous of curses, upon the parents,
and ascribes his ruin to their neglect! Let me
ask you, would not this part of that sad drama
add to your cup of bitterness, give a fearful emphasis
to all your sighs, and burnings to your
flooding tears? God would also speak to you,
and say as he did to Cain, "the voice of thy"
children&#8217;s "blood crieth unto me!" "And now
thou art cursed from the earth which hath opened
her mouth to receive thy" children&#8217;s "blood
from thy hand."</p>

<p class="dgp">But the scene would not close at the death-bed
of your child; the second act would open at the
bar of God. The maledictions of that ruined
one would there be poured out with increased
fury upon you. Parents of my home on earth!
I am lost&mdash;lost forever! Soon I shall go where
"the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
Had you, in the home of my childhood,
but instructed me, and been as faithful to my
soul as you were to my body, I might stand here
with a palm of victory in my hand, a crown of
glory on my head, the joy of the redeemed in

my heart, and with hosannas of praise upon my
lips, rise upward to the untold felicities of God&#8217;s
eternal throne! But you did not! You fed my
body, but you starved my soul, and left it to perish
forever! Cursed, be the day in which you
begat me, and the paps that gave me suck!
Cursed be the years that I lived under your roof,&mdash;cursed
be you! Oh, parents, such rebuke
would leave an undying worm in your souls;
and would cry unto you from the very depths of
hell.</p>

<p class="dgp">This is no over-wrought picture. It is but the
scripture prospectus of that terrible scene which
shall be enacted "in the terrible and notable day
of the Lord," when every Christian home shall
be called to give an "account of her stewardship,"
and be dealt with "according to the deeds
done in the body."</p>

<p class="dgp">And let me say too, that a similar and corresponding
responsibility rests upon those children
who enjoy the benefits of a faithful Christian
home. They must answer to God for every
blessing there enjoyed. If they turn a deaf ear
and a cold heart to all the entreaties of their
parents, and resist those saving influences which
are brought to bear upon them, and as a consequence,
become outcasts from society and from
heaven, then let me warn them that, every prayer
they heard at the family altar, every lesson given,
every admonition delivered, and every holy example
set them, by their pious parents, will be
ingredients in that bitter cup which it will take

eternity for them to exhaust! Oh, children of
the Christian home! think of this, and remember
the responsibility of enjoying the precious
benefits of a pious, faithful parent. They will be
your weal or your woe,&mdash;your lasting glory or
your lasting shame!</p>

<p class="dgp">And, ye parents, be faithful to those little ones
that are growing up "like olive plants around
your table," so that in the day of judgment, you
may say with joy, in the full assurance of reward,
"Here are we, Lord, and the children
whom thou hast given us!" And your reward
shall be, "Well done, thou good and faithful
servant! Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord!"</p>

<p class="noindent">The family bible! What sweet and hallowed
memories cling like tendrils around that book of
books! How familiar its sacred pages! How
often in the sunny days of childhood, we were
fed from its manna by the maternal hand! It
was our guide to the opening path of life, and a
lamp to the feeble, faltering steps of youth.
Who can forget the family bible? It was the

household oracle of our grandfathers and grandmothers,&mdash;of
our dear parents. It bears the record
of their venerated names; their birth, their
baptism, their confirmation, their marriage, are
here; and</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Though they are with the silent dead,</p>
<p class="l">Here are they living still!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">How joyfully they gathered around the cheerful
hearth to read this book divine. How often
their hearts drew consolation from its living
springs! What a balm it has poured into bleeding
and disconsolate hearts. It has irradiated
with the glories of eternal day, the darkest chamber
of their home. What brilliant hopes and
promises it has hung around the parental heart!
And here too are the names of our parents,&mdash;long
since gathered with their fathers. Here too are
our names, and birth, and baptism, written by
that parental hand, long since cold in death!</p>

<p class="l">  What thronging memories come?</p>
<p class="l">Again that little group is met</p>
<p class="l">  Within the halls of home!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That old family bible! Do we not love it?
Our names and our children&#8217;s names are drawn
from it. It is the message of our Father in heaven.

It is the link which connects our earthly
with our heavenly home; and when we open its
sacred page, we gaze upon words which our loved
ones in heaven have whispered, and which dwell
even now upon their sainted lips; and which
when we utter them, there is joy in heaven! We
would, therefore, say to the infidel, of this "family
tree," as the returning child said to the woodsman,
of the old tree which sheltered the slumbers
and frolics of his childhood, "I&#8217;ll protect it now."</p>

<p class="dgp">The old family bible! What an inheritance
from a Christian home! Clasp it, child, to thy
heart; it was the gift of a mother&#8217;s love! It
bears the impress of her hand; it is the memento
of her devotedness to thee; and when just before
her spirit took its flight to a better land, she gave
it as a guide for her child to the same happy
home:</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"My mother&#8217;s hand this bible clasped;</p>
<p class="l">She, dying, gave it me!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And the spirit of that sainted mother shall still
whisper to me through these sacred pages. In
the light of this lamp I follow her to a better
home. With this blessed chart I shall meet her
in heaven.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"With faltering lip and throbbing brow,</p>
<p class="l">I press it to my heart."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Every Christian home has a family bible. It
is found in the hut as well as in the palace. It is
an indispensable appendage to home. Without

it the Christian home would be in darkness;
with it, she is a "light which shineth in darkness."
It is the chart and compass of the parent
and the child in their pilgrimage to a better
home.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Therein thy dim eyes</p>
<p class="l">Will meet a cheering light; and silent words</p>
<p class="l">Of mercy breathed from heaven, will be exhaled</p>
<p class="l">From the blest page into thy withered heart."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Like an ethereal principle of light and life, its
blessed truths extend with electric force through
all the avenues and elements of the home-existence,
"giving music to language, elevation to
thought, vitality to feeling, intensity to power,
beauty and happiness."</p>

<p class="dgp">The bible is adapted to the Christian home.
It is the book for the family. It is the guardian
of her interests, the exposition of her duties, her
privileges, her hopes and her enjoyments. It exposes
her errors, reveals her authority and government,
sanctions her obedience, proclaims her
promises, and points out her path to heaven. It
makes sacred her marriages, furnishes names for
her children, gives the sacrament of her dedication
to God, and consecrates her bereavements.
It is the fountain of her richest blessings, the
source of her true consolation, and the ground of
her brightest hope. It is, therefore, the book of
home. She may have large and splendid libraries;
history, poetry, philosophy, fiction, yea, all
the works of classic Greece and Rome, may

crowd upon her shelves; but of these she will
soon grow wearied, and the dust of neglect will
gather thick upon their gilded leaves; but of
the bible the Christian home can never become
weary. Its sufficiency for all her purposes will
throw a garland of freshness around every page;
its variety and manifoldness; its simplicity and
beauty; its depth of thought and intensity of
feeling, adapt it to every capacity and to every
want, to every emergency and to every member,
of the household. The little child and the old
man, hoary with the frost of many winters, find
an equal interest there. The rich and the poor,
the learned and the ignorant, the high and the
low, are alike enriched from its inexhaustible
treasury.</p>

<p class="dgp">It is a book for the mind, the heart, the conscience,
the will and the life. It suits the palace
and the cottage, the afflicted and the prosperous,
the living and the dying. It is a comfort to "the
house of mourning," and a check to "the house
of feasting." It "giveth seed to the sower, and
bread to the eater." It is simple, yet grand;
mysterious, yet plain; and though from God, it is
nevertheless, within the comprehension of a little
child. You may send your children to school to
study other books, from which they may be educated
for this world; but in this divine book they
study the science of the eternal world.</p>

<p class="dgp">The family bible has given to the Christian
home that unmeasured superiority in all the dignities
and decencies and enjoyments of life, over

the home of the heathen. It has elevated woman,
revealed her true mission, developed the true idea
and sacredness of marriage and of the home-relationship;
it has unfolded the holy mission of the
mother, the responsibilities of the parent, and the
blessings of the child. Take this book from the
family, and she will degenerate into a mere conventionalism,
marriage into a "social contract;"
the spirit of mother will depart; natural affection
will sink to mere brute fondness, and what we
now call home would become a den of sullen selfishness
and barbaric lust!</p>

<p class="dgp">The bible should, therefore, be the text-book
of home-education. Where it is not, parents are
recreant to their duty. It is the basis of all teaching,
because it reveals "the truth, the way and the
life," because it is God&#8217;s testimony and message,
and is "profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,
for instruction in righteousness," and was
written "for our learning, that we, through patience
and comfort of the scriptures, might have
hope," and be made "wise unto salvation."</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"While thou wert teaching my lips to move</p>
<p class="l">  And my heart to rise in prayer,</p>
<p class="l">I learned the way to a home above;</p>
<p class="l">  And thou shalt meet me there!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Its invaluable treasures, its manifoldness, its
beautiful simplicity, its striking narrative, its
startling history, its touches of home-life, its expansive
views of human nature, of this life and
of that which is to come, its poetry, eloquence,

and soul-stirring sympathies and aspirations,
make it the book for home-training. These features
of its character will develop in beautiful
harmony the whole nature of your child. Do
you wish to inspire them with song? What songs
are like those of Zion? Do you wish them to
come under the influence of eloquent oration?
What orations so eloquent as those of the prophets,
of Christ, and of his apostles? Do you desire
to refine and elevate their souls with beauty
and sublimity? Here in these sacred pages is a
beauty ever fresh, and a sublimity which towers
in dazzling radiance far beyond the reach of human
genius. This is evident from the fact that
tributes of admiration have been paid to the bible
by the most eminent poets, jurists, statesmen,
and philosophers, such as Milton, Hale, Boyle,
Newton and Locke. Erasmus and John Locke
betook themselves solely to the bible, after they
had wandered through the gloomy maze of human
erudition. Neither Grecian song nor Roman
eloquence; neither the waters of Castalia, nor the
fine-spun theorisms of scholastic philosophy, could
satisfy their yearnings. But when they wandered
amid the consecrated bowers of Zion, and drank
from Siloah&#8217;s brook, the thirst of their genius was
quenched, and they took their seats with Mary at
the feet of Jesus, and like little children, learned
of him!</p>

<p class="dgp">Even deists and infidels have yielded their tribute
of praise. What says the infidel Rosseau?
Hear him: "The majesty of the scriptures strikes

me with astonishment. Look at the volumes of
the philosophers, with all their pomp, how contemptible
do they appear in comparison with this!
Is it possible that a book at once so simple and
sublime, can be the work, of men?" Thus</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Learning and zeal, from age to age,</p>
<p class="l">Have worshiped, loved, explored the page."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">How often is this precious book abused! In
many would-be Christian homes, it is used more
for an ornament of fashion than for a lamp to the
Christian&#8217;s path. We find the bible upon their
parlor table, but how seldom in the family room!
They make it a part of their fashionable furniture,
to be looked at as a pretty, gilded thing. Its
golden clasps and beautiful binding make it an
attractive appendage to the parlor. Hence they
buy the bible, but not the truth it contains. They
place it upon the table as such; and indeed many
do not even give it that prominence, but, yielding
to the taste of fashion, place it under the parlor
table, and there it rests, unmolested, untouched
and unread even for years. In many professedly
religious families this is their family bible! Ah!
it is not so heartsome as that well-marked and
long-used old bible which lies upon the table of
the nursery room, speaking of many year&#8217;s service
in family devotion! The other unused bible
seems like a stranger to the home-heart, and lies
in the parlor just to show their visiting friends
that they have a bible! Go into the nursery and
other private apartments of that home, and you

see no bible, while you behold piles of romance
and filthy novels,&mdash;those exponents of a vitiated
taste and a corrupt society, suited to destroy the
young forever;&mdash;whose outward appearance indicates
a studied perusal by both parents and children,
and shows perhaps that they have been
wept over; and whose inward substance must
ever nauseate healthy reason, as well as poison
the heart of youth, leading them from the sober
realities of life into a world of nonentities.</p>

<p class="dgp">But upon the family bible you cannot trace
the hand of diligent piety. It is shoved back into
some part of the room, as a worthless thing, obsolete
and superfluous. And see! it is not even
kept in decent order. The dust of many day&#8217;s
neglect has gathered thick upon its lids. Oh,
Christian parents, when you thus close up the
wells of salvation by the trash of degenerate
taste and vitiated morals, you are despising the
testimonies of the Lord, and leading your children
step by step to the verge of destruction.
You may buy them splendid, bibles, gilt and
clasped with gold, and have their names labeled
in golden letters upon its lid; but if the good old
family bible is neglected, and the yellow covered
literature of the day substituted in its stead; if
you permit them to buy and read love-sick tales
in preference to their bible, and they see you do
the same, you are but making a mock of God&#8217;s
Word, and must answer before Him for your
children&#8217;s neglect of its sacred pages.</p>

<p class="dgp">Let me, therefore, affectionately admonish you

to be faithful to that precious book you call the
family bible. Read it to your children every day.
From its sacred pages teach them the way to live
and the way to die. Let it be an opened, studied
family chart to guide you and them in visions of
untold glory to the many mansions of your
Father&#8217;s offered home in heaven. It will soothe
your sorrows, calm your fears, strengthen your
faith, brighten your hopes, and throw around the
graves of the loved and the cherished dead, the
light and promise of reunion in heaven!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"A drop of balm from this rich store,</p>
<p class="l">Hath healed the broken heart once more.</p>
<p class="l">Like angels round a dying bed,</p>

<p class="l">And hovering on celestial wings,</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter IX&mdash;Infancy.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"A babe in a house is a well-spring of pleasure, a messenger of</p>
<p class="l">  peace and love;</p>
<p class="l">A resting place for innocence on earth; a link between angels and men;</p>
<p class="l">Yet it is a talent of trust to be rendered back with interest;</p>
<p class="l">A delight, but redolent of care, honey sweet, but lacking not the bitter,</p>
<p class="l">For character groweth day by day, and all things aid it in unfolding,</p>
<p class="l">And the bent unto good or evil may be given, in the hours of infancy."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The birth of each child constitutes a new era
in the Christian home, and multiplies its cares, its
pleasures and its responsibilities. The first-born
babe, like</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "The first gilt thing</p>
<p class="l">That wears the trembling pearls of spring,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">throws the rainbow colors of hope and joy over
the bowers of home, and awakens in the bosom

of parents, emotions and sympathies, new-born
and never before experienced; cords in the heart,
before untouched, now begin to thrill with new
joy; sympathies, before unfelt, now swell the
bosom. Sleep on, thou little one, in thy "rosy
mesh of infancy," in the first buddings of thy
being! These hours of thy innocence are the
happiest of thy life. Thou art "the parent&#8217;s
transport and the parent&#8217;s care." Blessings are
fondly poured upon thy head. Rest thee there
in thy little bed, thou happy emblem of the loved
and pure in heaven!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Visions sure of joy</p>
<p class="l">Are gladdening his rest; and ah, who knows</p>
<p class="l">But waiting angels do converse in sleep</p>
<p class="l">With babes like this!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">imparting to his infant soul unutterable things,
whispering soft of bliss immortal given, and pouring
into his new-born senses the dreams of opening
heaven.</p>

<p class="dgp">What charms and momentous interests surround
the cradle of infancy! When the first
wailing of dependence reaches the listening ear,
what new-born sympathies spring up in the parent&#8217;s
bosom! What a thrill of rapture the first
soft smile of her babe sends to the mother&#8217;s
heart! It is this, the parents&#8217; likeness unsullied
by their faults and cares; it is this, their living
love in personal being,&mdash;their love breathing and
smiling before them, lisping their names; it is
this,&mdash;their new-born hope and care,&mdash;that gives

to infancy such a charm, such a never-dying interest,
and causes the parent to cling to it with
such fond tenacity. "Can a mother forget her
sucking child?" Never, while she claims a mother&#8217;s
heart! The couch of her babe is the depository
of all those fond hopes and joys and cares and
memories to which a mother&#8217;s heart is sacred.</p>

<p class="dgp">The infant is the most interesting member of
the Christian home. It is the first budding of
home-life, disclosing every day some new beauty,
"the father&#8217;s lustre and the mother&#8217;s bloom," to
gladden the hearts of the family. "As the dewy
morning is more beautiful than the perfect day;
as the opening bud is more lovely than the full
blown flower, so is the joyous dawn of infant
life more interesting than the calm monotony of
riper years." It is the most interesting, because
the purest, member of the household. It is the
connecting link which binds home to its great
antitype above. "Ye stand nearest to God, ye
little ones," nearer than those who have tasted
the bitter cup of actual sin. They are the
budding promises, the young loves, the precious
plants of home; they are its sunshine, its progressive
interest, its prophetic happiness, the first
link in the chain of its perpetuity. Like the
purple hue of the wild heath, throwing its gay
color over the rugged hill-side, they cast a magic
polish over the spirit of the parent, causing the
home-fireside to glow with new life and cheerfulness.</p>

<p class="dgp">Infants are emblems of the loved and sainted

ones in heaven. "Of such is the kingdom of
heaven." "Except ye become as this little child,
ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven."
This is based upon proper principles. The heart
of the child is purely devotional and confidential.
It is a helpless dependent upon the parent. It
abdicates its self-will with joy; silently do the
laws of home control it; its reverence and love
are the melody of its being; its life is an exchange
of obedience for protection. Its path is
chosen for it by the lamp of parental experience,
and the calm pure light of a mother&#8217;s love. How
close it keeps to the heart that loves it, and to the
hand that leads it! It looks without doubt or
suspicion in the parent&#8217;s eye, and makes the parent&#8217;s
home and interest its own.</p>

<p class="dgp">Here is a picture of the true child of God in
his tent-home on earth, and in his eternal home
in heaven. For this they are given to us. As
they are to us, their parents, so should we be to
our Father in heaven, and so are all those loved
and sainted ones who have gone before us.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Little children, flowers from heaven,</p>
<p class="l">  Strewn on earth by God&#8217;s own hand,</p>
<p class="l">Earnest emblems to us given,</p>
<p class="l">  From, the fields of angel-land!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Hence it was that Jesus loved little children,
took them in His arms, blessed them, and regarded
them as "the lambs of His flock." "He shall
gather the lambs with His arm." He gazed with
pleasure into their sweet faces, invited their parents

to bring them unto Him, and held them up
as the type of the spirit and character of the admitted,
into heaven. And the aged John, having
in view this typical character of children, addressed
his followers as his little children!</p>

<p class="dgp">Infants are helpless dependents upon others for
subsistence and protection. If abandoned at their
birth, their first breath would soon be succeeded
by their last. Hence they demand all the attention
which maternal love and tenderness can bestow.
They live like the tender bud or the opening
blossom, exposed to the blight of a thousand
fortuitous events. Hence their existence is very
precarious; in a moment they may sink like the
frosted flower in its lovely blush. This may be
said of the soul as well as of the body and mind.
What an argument, therefore, we have here for
parental diligence and promptness in duty to the
eternal as well as to the temporal well-being of
the child.</p>

<p class="dgp">The infant is the first prophecy of the man. It
is the germ of manhood. It is the man in a state
of involution. It is the undeveloped man. Infancy
is the twilight of life,&mdash;the first morning of
an endless being, the age of germ and of mere
sense. As the first dawn of spring is the season
of the undeveloped harvest, so childhood is manhood
in possibility. The infant is the vernal bud
of life; it is a being of promise and of hope,&mdash;the
prophecy of the future man. Hence the
age of education. The mother, in the nursery,
is ever evolving into the strength of maturity

those powers of her child which will be wielded
for happiness or for misery. Her babe is an "embryo
angel, or an infant fiend." We behold in
that fragile form, the bud of the strong man,&mdash;the
possibility of one who may in a few years
arouse with his thrilling eloquence a slumbering
nation, or with the torch and sword of revolution,
overturn empires and dethrone kings, or
with his feet upon the walls of Zion, and the
words of life upon his lips, overthrow the strongholds
of Satan, and bring the rebel sinner in penitence
to the feet of Jesus. Yea, we see in that
wailing infant of a week, the outspringing of an
immortal spirit which may soon hover on cherub-pinion
around the throne of God, or perhaps, in a
few years, sink to the regions of untold anguish.
Oh, it is this which gives to the cradle of infancy
such a thrilling interest. The star of those new-born
hopes, which hangs over it, will set in eternal
night, or rise with increasing splendor, till it
is lost in the full blaze of eternal day!</p>

<p class="dgp">Infants are a great, a dangerous and responsible
trust. They are the property of God,&mdash;"an
heritage from the Lord," given to their parents
as a loan, a "talent of trust to be rendered back
with interest." The infant is especially the mother&#8217;s
trust.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Though first by thee it lived, on thee it smiled,</p>
<p class="l">Yet not for thee existence must it hold,</p>
<p class="l">For God&#8217;s it is, not thine!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Given by its Creator in trust to her, it is her task

to bring it up for God. Here especially do we
see the holy mission of the mother. None but
the mother&#8217;s heart and love can give security for
this trust. The father is unfit by nature for the
delicate training of infancy. The mother&#8217;s hand
alone can smooth the infant&#8217;s couch, and her voice
alone can sing him to his rosy rest. Her never-wearied
love alone can watch beside him "till the
last pale star had set,"</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"While to the fullness of her heart&#8217;s glad heavings</p>
<p class="l">His fair cheek rose and fell; and his bright hair</p>
<p class="l">Waved softly to her breast."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">She is the ministering angel of infancy, and the
priestess of the nursery of home. She sets the
first seal, makes the first stamp, gives the first
direction, supplies the first want, and soothes the
first sorrow. To her is committed human life in
its most helpless and dangerous state. Touch it
then with the rude hand of parental selfishness;
let it grow up in a barren soil, amid noxious weeds,
under the influence of unholy example; and the
delicate tints of this blossom will soon fade; the
blush of loveliness will soon give way to the blight
of moral deformity.</p>

<p class="dgp" style="text-align: center"><img src="images/image3.png" alt="TEACHING THE SCRIPTURES. J. Porter"><br />TEACHING THE SCRIPTURES. J. Porter</p>

<p class="dgp">Hence every babe will be the parent&#8217;s glory or
the parent&#8217;s shame, their weal or their woe. If
entrusted to them, God will hold them responsible
for its moral training. He will require it from
them with interest. Their trust involves the eternal
happiness or misery of their child. The productions
of art will perish; the sun will be blotted

out, and all the glory and magnificence of the
world will vanish away, but your babe will live
forever. It will survive the wreck of nature, and
either shine as a diadem in the Redeemer&#8217;s crown
of glory, or dwell in the blackness and darkness
of perdition forever.</p>

<p class="dgp">To you, Christian parents, as the stewards of
God, this precious being is entrusted. The care
of its body, mind and spirit is committed to you;
and its character and destiny in after life will be
the fruit of your dealings with it. It looks to you
for all things. It confides in you, draws its confidence
from your protection, relies on your known
love, takes you as the pattern of its life, imitates
you as its example, learns from you as its teacher,
is ruled by you as its governor, is measured by
you as its model, feels satisfied with you as its
sufficiency, and rests its all upon you as its all and
in all.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus you are the very life and soul of its being,
and hence in its maturity, it will be a fair exponent
of your character. You are the center
around which its life revolves, the circumference
beyond which it never seeks to go. What, therefore,
if you are unfit to move and act in its presence!
What, if in its imitation of you, its life
be a progressive departure from God! Oh, what,
if in the day of judgment, it be an outcast from
heaven, and, as such, bear the impress of a parent&#8217;s
hand! God will then hold you accountable
for every injury you may have done your
child.</p>



<p class="dgp">Begin, therefore, the work of training that
infant, now, while its nature is pliable, susceptible,
yet tenacious of first impressions. "With
his mother&#8217;s milk the young child drinketh education."
What you now do for your child will
be seen in all future ages. "Scratch the green
rind of a sapling, or wantonly twist it in the
soil, the scarred and crooked oak will tell of
thee for centuries to come." "It will not depart
from the ways in which you train it." If,
therefore, you would be a blessing to your child,
and avert those terrible judgments of God which
rest upon parental delinquency, begin now, while
your infant is in the cradle, to sow the seeds of
life. Prune well the tender olive plants, and
direct its evolving life in the way God would
have it go.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Soon as the playful innocent can prove</p>
<p class="l">A tear of pity or a smile of love,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">teach it to lisp the name of Jesus and to walk in
His commandments. But alas! how many Christian
parents are recreant to this duty! How many
destroy their children by the over-indulgence of a
misdirected love and sympathy, and by procrastinating
the period of home-education. Forgetful
of the power of first impressions, they wait until
their children are established in sin, and the seeds
of evil are sown in their hearts.</p>

<p class="dgp">This is the reason why so many reckless and
wicked children come out of Christian homes.
Their parents permit their misdirected fondness

to absorb all their thoughts and apprehensions of
danger and responsibility. Their love for the
body and mind of their children seems to repel
all love for, or interest in, their soul. The former
they tenderly nurse, fondly caress, and zealously
direct. But the soul of the infant is unhonored,
unloved and uncared for. It is blighted in its
first bursting of beauty. Oh, cruel and unthinking
parents! why will you thus abuse the loveliest
and noblest part of your child? Why make that
babe of yours a mere plaything? If "out of the
mouths of babes and sucklings God has perfected
praise," then why not train them up to praise
Him? "Take heed that ye despise not one of
these little ones, for I say unto you, that in heaven
their angels do always behold the face of my Father
which is in heaven." Oh, you who are the
nurse of infant innocence, have you ever thought
of the deep curse that will attend your neglect of
the babe which God has given you! Have you,
pious mother, as you pressed your child to your
bosom, ever thought that it would one day be a
witness for or against you? Far better for thee
and it that it were not born and you never revered
as mother, than that you should nourish it for spiritual
beggary here, and for the eternal burnings
hereafter! Oh, look upon that babe! It is the
gift of God&mdash;given to thee, mother, to nurse for
Him. Look upon that cherished one! See its
smile of confidence turned to you! It is a frail
and helpless bark on the tumultuous sea of life;
it looks to you for direction,&mdash;for compass and

for chart; your prayers for it will be heard; your
hand can save it; the touch of your impressions
will be a savor of life unto life, or of death unto
death.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Then take the heart thy charms have won,</p>
<p class="l">And nurse it for the skies!"</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter X&mdash;Home Dedication.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The rose was rich in bloom on Sharon&#8217;s plain,</p>
<p class="l">When a young mother with her first born thence</p>
<p class="l">Went up to Zion, for the boy was vowed</p>
<p class="l">Unto the Temple-service; by the hand</p>
<p class="l">She led him, and her silent soul, the while,</p>
<p class="l">Oft as the dewy laughter of his eye</p>
<p class="l">Met her sweet serious glance, rejoiced to think</p>
<p class="l">That aught so pure, so beautiful, was hers,</p>
<p class="l">To bring before her God!"</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Beautiful thought, and thrice beautiful deed,&mdash;fresh
from the pure fount of maternal piety!
The Hebrew mother consecrating her first-born
child to the Temple-service,&mdash;dedicating him to
the God who gave him! What visions of unearthly
glory must have been before her, as she
led her little boy before the altar of the "King
of kings!" Happy mother! thou hast long since
gone to thy great reward. And happy child! to
be led by such a mother. Ye are now together
in that temple "not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens," and with united voice swelling

those anthems of glory which are poured from
angelic lips and harps to Him who sitteth upon
the throne.</p>

<p class="dgp">What an example is this for the Christian parent!
God is the Father of every home. From
Him cometh down every good and perfect gift;
and hence to Him should all the interests and the
loved ones of the household, be dedicated. This
is essential to the very conception of a Christian
home.</p>

<p class="dgp">But especially should the children be dedicated
to the Lord. That infant over which the mother
bends and watches with such passionate fondness,
is "an heritage of the Lord," given to her only
in trust, and will again be required from her.
As soon as children are given they should be
devoted to Him; for "the flower, when offered
in the bud, is no mean sacrifice." Then and
then only will parents properly respect and value
their offspring, and deal with them as becometh
the property of God. By withholding them, the
parents become guilty of the deed of Ananias
and Sapphira. Like the Hebrew mother, every
Christian parent will gratefully devote them to
Him, and rejoice that they have such a pure
oblation to "bring before their God."</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"My child, my treasure, I have given thee up</p>
<p class="l">To Him who gave thee me! Ere yet thine eye</p>
<p class="l">Rested with conscious love upon thy mother,</p>
<p class="l">Long ere thy lips could gently sound her name,</p>
<p class="l">She gave thee up to God; she sought for thee</p>

<p class="l">One boon alone, that thou mightest he His child;</p>
<p class="l">His child sojourning on this distant land,</p>
<p class="l">His child above the blue and radiant sky,</p>
<p class="l">&#8217;Tis all I ask of thee, beloved one, still!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here is a dedication worthy of a Christian
mother. Natural affection and human pride
might lead the fond mother to dedicate her
child at the altar of Mammon, to gold, to fame,
to magnificence, to the world. But no, every
wish of the pious mother&#8217;s heart is merged in
one great wish and prayer, "that thou may&#8217;st
be His child."</p>

<p class="dgp">The dedication of our children to the Lord is
one of the first acts of the religious ministry of
home. All the means of grace will be of no
avail without it. What will the acts of the gospel
minister avail if they are not preceded by an
offering of himself to the Lord who has called
him? His holy vocation demands such an offering.
It is his voluntary response to and acceptance
of his calling of God. Thus with
Christian parents. What will baptism avail,
so far as the parents are concerned, without this
dedication of their children to Him in whose
name they are baptised? No more than the
form apart from the spirit. It would be but a
mockery of God.</p>

<p class="dgp">We have a beautiful example and illustration
of this dedication, in the family of the faithful
Abraham. "By faith Abraham, when he was
tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received
the promises offered up his only begotten son."

We might at first view regard this act of his as
an evidence of his want of parental sympathy
and tenderness. But not so; it is rather an evidence
of these. What he did was the prompting
of a true faith, yielding implicit obedience to the
Lord, and offering as an obligation to Him, what
he loved most upon earth. Had he not loved
him so dearly, God would not have chosen him
as a means of testing his father&#8217;s religious fidelity.
Hence this oblation of his son was the best
evidence of his supreme love to God, and that all
he had was consecrated to his service. This act
called for the subordination of natural affection
to Christian faith and love. "Take now thine
only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee
into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for
a burnt offering!"</p>

<p class="dgp">What a startling command was this! How it
must have stirred up the soul of that parent, and
for the time caused a bitter conflict between natural
affection and Christian faith! "Take thy
son,"&mdash;had it been a slave, the command would
not have been so stirring; but a son, an only son,
the joy of his heart, and the pride and hope of
his age,&mdash;the son he so much loved,&mdash;oh it was
this that harrowed up such a revulsion in his
soul, and, for the moment doubtless, caused him
to shrink from the very thought of obedience.
But the command was imperious,&mdash;it was from
God; and though the parent shrunk from the
deed, yet the faith of the faithful servant gained
a signal triumph over all the protestations of natural

affection, and silenced all its rising murmurs;
for "Abraham rose up early in the morning, and
saddled his ass, and took two of his young men
with, him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood
for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto
the place of which God had told him." There
he built an altar, laid the wood in order, bound
Isaac, and laid him upon the wood on the altar.
But when with uplifted sacrificial knife, he was
about to slay his son, just at the point where God
had the true test of his faith, a ministering angel
stayed his hand, and prevented the bloody form
in which he was about to offer his only son to
God; "for now I know that thou fearest God,
seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only
son, from me!" He needed now but dedicate
him in the moral sense to God.</p>

<p class="dgp">The case of Samuel is another instance of the
offering of children unto the Lord. His mother
had asked him of the Lord, and vowed, as she
prayed, to "give him unto the Lord all the days
of his life."&mdash;1 Sam. I., 11. Her prayer was answered,
and in obedience to her holy vow, she
took him, when very young, with her to the
Temple, where she offered him up as an oblation
to the Lord. "For this child I prayed, and the
Lord hath given me my petition which I asked
of him; therefore also have I lent him to the
Lord; as long as he liveth shall he be lent unto
the Lord!" David also consecrated all that he
had to the Lord,&mdash;his possessions as well as his
children. When he built a house, he dedicated

it to the Lord, and prepared "a psalm and song
at the dedication of the house."</p>

<p class="dgp">Here in these examples of Old Testament family
offerings to God, we have a type and illustration
of the oblations of the Christian home. The
Lord does not ask the Christian parent, as he did
Abraham, to build an altar upon the summit of
some lofty cliff, and there to thrust a sacrificial
knife to the heart of his child, and offer his quivering
flesh and bleeding body a burnt offering to
him; but he commands him to bring his child to
the altar of baptism in his church, and there dedicate
his life, his talents, his all, as a living sacrifice
"holy and acceptable unto God," vowing
before witnessing angels and men that, as the
steward of God and the representative of the
child, he will hold it sacred, as the property of the
Lord, given to him only in trust; that he will
consult and faithfully execute the will of the
Lord concerning the child, and that in all his relations
to it, he will seek to make it subserve his
purposes and reflect his glory.</p>

<p class="dgp">This is the most precious and acceptable oblation
of the parent&#8217;s heart and home,&mdash;more precious
than gold or pearls, than rivers of blood, or
streams of oil; and where there is a corresponding
dedication of all that belongs to home, it promotes
and preserves the highest privileges and
the greatest well-being of the child. With the
deep and sublime feelings of faith we should,
therefore, take our little ones, in infancy, before
the Lord, as the free-will offering of the Christian

home; and in all subsequent periods of their life
under the parental roof, we should eagerly watch,
in each expanding faculty, in each growing inclination,
in the bent of each tender thought, in the
warm glow of each feeling and desire, for some
indications of the will of God concerning their
mission in this life.</p>

<p class="dgp">This leads us to remark finally, that, in the
dedication of our children to the Lord, we should
have reference to the highest function within the
calling of man, viz: the christian ministry; or in
other words, we should offer our sons to God
with the hope and prayer that He may call them
to the work of the ministry, and every indication
of His answer to our prayer, given in their mental
and moral fitness, should encourage the parent
to train them up with special reference to that
sacred office.</p>

<p class="dgp">This, the state of the church and the many destitute
and waste places of the earth, imperiously
demand. Like the Hebrew mother, we should at
least devote one of our sons to the Temple-service,
direct his attention to it, favor it by all our intercourse
with him, and use all proper means for his
preparation for it. And you may be assured that
God will answer your prayer. Your offering, if
holy, will be acceptable.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Even thus, of old, a babe was offered up&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Young Samuel, for the service of His Temple;</p>
<p class="l">Nor He refused the boon, but poured on him</p>
<p class="l">The anointing of all gifts and graces meet</p>
<p class="l">For his high office."</p>
</div>



<p class="dgp">But alas! how many parents refuse thus to
yield their sons unto God! They will formally
and outwardly dedicate their children to Him in
holy baptism; but afterwards obstruct their way
to the ministry, yea, even discourage it for reasons
the most worldly and infidel. They will
remind them of its arduous duties and self-denials;
they will remind them that it affords no
money speculations, that the salary of ministers
is so small, no wealth can be amassed by preaching,
and besides, they will have to remove so far
from home. And thus by urging such frivolous
objections, they beget in their sons a prejudice
against the ministry,&mdash;yea, a contempt for it.
Ah, if preaching were a money-making business;
if it opened the door to luxury and affluence
and worldly ease, then I am sure every
parent would show the outward piety of dedicating
his sons (and daughters too) to the ministry.
Here we see how natural affection, misdirected
by the love of worldly gain, neutralizes
the promptings of faith. Had Abraham lived
under the same influence, he would not have
obeyed the edict of God. It is because of the
dominant spirit of worldliness in the Christian
home, that the laborers upon the walls of Zion
are inadequate to the great work to be done, that
they are insufficient for the great harvest of
souls. And this will ever continue so long as
Christian parents refuse to make an offering of
their sons to God, and turn their homes into a
den of thieves.</p>



<p class="dgp">Such parental reservation of children for filthy
lucre and the pleasures of sin for a season, involves
a guilt which no redeeming attribute can
mitigate. If God gave his only Son to suffer
and die upon the accursed tree, shall we, his
professed followers, not give in turn our sons
to Him, to proclaim the glad news of a purchased
and offered redemption? Think of this,
oh ye who profess to be the parents of a Christian
home, and have with the lip had your children
dedicated to God in baptism! Think that
the gift of God has bought them with a price,
and that as they belong to Him, you rob God
when you withhold them, and deal with them
as your own property, leaving out of view the
great law of stewardship. Mistaken parents!
methinks you would give your children to all
save to God; you would devote them to any
thing but religion. You fit them for this life,
choose their occupation, labor to leave them a
large inheritance, and rejoice when they rise to
eminence in the world.</p>

<p class="dgp">But in all this, God, religion and eternity are
cast into the shade; you act towards them as if
God had no claim upon them, and you were
under no obligations to meet that claim. Think
of this, ye who have been recreant to your duty,&mdash;ye
who have not followed Abraham to the
mount of oblation, nor brought up your sons as
an offered Samuel. Oh think, that God will
demand of you these children, and that if they
are not now devoted to the Lord, you will not

have them to return to Him in the great day of
final reckoning. May the momentous interests
and responsibilities of that coming day bring
you with your children around the altar of consecration,
and constrain you there to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"I give thee to thy God&mdash;the God that gave thee,</p>
<p class="l">A well-spring of deep gladness to my heart!</p>
<p class="l">  And precious as thou art,</p>
<p class="l">And pure as dew of Hermon, He shall have thee,</p>
<p class="l">My own, my beautiful, my undefiled!</p>

<p class="noindent">What delightful associations cluster around the
baptismal altar! How tenderly does the pious
mother fold her babe to her yearning heart, as she
devoutly approaches that consecrated spot, and
there dedicates in and through this holy sacrament,
the child of her love and hope, to Him
who gave it! What a holy charge she there
assumes; what a sacred vow she there makes;
what a solemn promise she there gives; what a
momentous interest is entrusted to her there;
what a weight of responsibility is there laid upon
her!</p>



<p class="dgp">Her charge is an infant soul; her vow is to be
faithful to it; her promise is to train it up for
God; and her&#8217;s will be the lasting glory or the
lasting shame! These very engagements and
trusts elevate the pious parents; diffuse a tenderness
and sympathy over all the domestic relations,
and make better husbands, better wives,
better parents, and better children, by the deep
insight which is given to their faith in those mysterious
relations and mutual obligations which
bind them together. As the consecrated water
falls upon the face of the devoted child, the parents
feel the solemn vow sink deep into the soul,
and realize the weight of that responsibility which
God lays upon them.</p>

<p class="dgp">God commands us not only to dedicate our children
to Him, but to do so in the way He has appointed,
viz., in and through Christian baptism.
In this way we bring our children into the church,
and train them up in a churchly way. We bring
them to God through the church. In their baptism
we have, as it were, a confirmation of their
dedication by "the mighty Master&#8217;s seal." It is
the link which binds our children to the church,
the rite of their initiation into the kingdom of
Christ, the sign and seal of their saving relation
to the covenant of grace. By it they are solemnly
set apart to the service of God, enrolled among
the members of His kingdom, entitled to its privileges
and guardian care, and placed in the appointed
way of salvation and eternal life, receiving
the seal and superscription of the Son of God.

This is indispensable to the demands of the Christian
faith. To deny that infants are thus included
in the covenant of grace, destroys the purity and
spiritual unity of the Christian compact, and subverts
the foundations and harmony of the Christian
home.</p>

<p class="dgp">It is revolting to the parent&#8217;s faith to forbid
his little ones the privilege of the church, and to
treat them as aliens from the covenant of promise.
Does the gospel place them under such a ban
of proscription? Surely not! He who instituted
the family relation had special regard to the family
in all the appointments of his grace. His command
is like that of Noah, "Come thou and all
thy house into the ark." "The promise is unto
you and your children." This is the comfort of
the parent, that his children are planted by the
ordinance of God into the soil of grace, where
they may grow up as a tender plant in the likeness
of His death, and be "like a tree planted by
the rivers of water, that shall bring forth his fruit
in his season; his leaf shall not wither, and whatsoever
he doeth shall prosper."</p>

<p class="dgp">Baptism in the Christian home is eminently
infant baptism. Take this away, and you sever
the strongest cord that binds church and home.
As the Jew was commanded to circumcise his
child, and thus bring it into proper relations
to the theocratical covenant, so the Christian has
a similar command from Christ to bring his
children, through the holy sacrament of baptism,
to Him. It is not our purpose to discuss

the baptistic question. When we shall have
thrown sufficient light upon it to convince the
Christian parent, that it is a duty to have little
children dedicated to God in baptism, our plan
shall be fully executed. We must either admit
infant baptism, or deny that the Christian covenant
includes children, and that the parent is
bound to dedicate them to God. Hence the objection
brought against infant baptism can, with
equal propriety, be urged against circumcision;
for the latter is the type of the former. In baptism
Christ places Himself in true organic relations
to the child, and thus opens up to it the
sources from which alone the Christian life can
proceed and develop itself.</p>

<p class="dgp">The baptism of our children is grounded in
their need of salvation at every age and stage of
development. It is also based upon the very idea
of Christ Himself; upon primitive christianity;
upon the extent and compass of the Christian
covenant; and upon those vital relations which
believing parents sustain to their offspring. It
might be proven from the commission given by
Christ to His disciples to "preach the gospel to
every creature;" from His language and conduct
in reference to children; from the usage of the
Apostles and of the apostolic church. The idea
and mission of Christ Himself, we think, would
be a sufficient argument in favor of infant baptism.
He included in His life the stage of childhood,
and came to save the child as well as the
man. His own infancy and childhood are securities

for this. He entered into and passed through
all the various states and stages of man&#8217;s development
on earth, and thus became adapted to the
wants of every period of our life,&mdash;man&#8217;s infancy
as well as man&#8217;s maturity. Ireneus says, "Christ
Jesus became a child to children, a youth to youth,
and a man to man." The fact, too, that the blessings
of the covenant of grace are extended to the
children of believing parents, is sufficient to prove
the validity of infant baptism. Peter said on the
day of Pentecost, when he called upon his hearers
to be baptized: "for the promise is to you,
and your children, and all that are afar off, even
as many as the Lord our God shall call."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus His gospel excludes none, neither is it
restricted to a certain age or capacity. As the
child, as well as the man, fell and died in the
first Adam, so the child, as well as the man,
can be made alive in the second Adam. As
infants, therefore, are subjects of grace, why not
subjects also of baptism? As they are included
in the covenant, why not enter it by the divinely
constituted sacrament of initiation? As they are
included in the plan of salvation, why not receive
it in a churchly way? If Christ is the Saviour of
infants, why not bring them to Him through baptism?</p>

<p class="dgp">Besides, the idea of following Christ reaches its
full meaning only through infant baptism. His
own infancy, as we have already seen, is a warrant
of this. Without it He cannot penetrate and rule
in every natural stage of human life. Hence a

denial of infant baptism is a subversion of the
fundamentals of Christian doctrine. The very
constitution of the Christian family, its unity and
mission must be overthrown; for infant baptism
is incorporated with the nature of christianity
itself, with the conception and necessities of the
individual Christian life, and of the Christian
family life.</p>

<p class="dgp">And yet with the plainest teachings of the gospel
before them, is it not strange that there are so
many virulent enemies to infant baptism? Their
rejection of it seems to rest mainly upon the untenable
position that baptism has meaning and
force only when it is the fruit of an antecedent,
self-conscious faith on the part of the subject, and
that it is but the outward demonstration of a separate
and prior participation of some inward grace.
As infants have not a self-conscious faith, it is believed,
therefore, that they are not, of course, fit
subjects of baptism.</p>

<p class="dgp">There is a cunning sophistry in all this. It
goes upon the supposition that faith necessarily
demands the prior development of self-consciousness.
It assumes that faith is bound to a particular
age, and can be exercised only after the full
and complete development of the logical consciousness,
and is dependent upon it; it also assumes
that this faith must necessarily be exercised
by the subject of Christian baptism.</p>

<p class="dgp">Now this is all mere assumption. There is no
scripture for it. In all this, the distinction is not
made between faith in its first bud, and faith in

its ripe fruit. The first may exist in the unconscious
infant, just as undeveloped reason exists
there; because natural powers do not generate
supernatural faith. Faith is the gift of God;
and its existence does not depend upon any particular
stage of mental development. The enemies
of infant baptism can see nothing in baptism.
They can see no objective force in that holy sacrament;
but regard it as something merely external,
extraneous, unproductive,&mdash;a mere unmeaning
form in which a prior faith is pleased to express
itself, as the conclusion of a work already
accomplished. The great error here lies just in
this, that they mistake it as an act of faith, whereas
it is an act of Christ. They think it is the
formal rite through which they elect and receive
Christ; whereas it is the sacrament in which
Christ elects and receives them.</p>

<p class="dgp">If, in church worship, man placed himself in a
relation to God, without God placing Himself in
a relation to man, then we might reject infant
baptism. But this is not so. God, in baptism,
places Himself in a relation to the subject, receives
the subject until it become a part of the
organism of grace in its subjective and objective
force, and is recognized as a member of the
church of Christ. Now the falsity of the position
assumed by the enemies of infant baptism
lies just here, that only the subjective side of
baptism is held up, while its objective, sacramental
character is left altogether out of view.
It reverses the relative positions of faith and baptism,

making the former to take the place of the
latter, and holding that any one dissociated with
the church, can receive and exercise a true living
faith, which overthrows the very idea of the
church itself. It makes faith first, baptism second,
entering the church third; whereas baptism
comes before the conscious faith of the subject.
If so, then why object to infant baptism?</p>

<p class="dgp">Baptism is that sacrament by means of which
the order of divine grace is continued. It generates
faith, and its development is from authoritative,
to free, personal faith. "What the personal
election of Christ was to the first circle
of disciples, that baptism is for the successive
church, the divine fact through which Christ
gives to His church its true and eternal beginning
in the individual." If so, then is it not
plain that baptism goes before the self-conscious
faith of the subject? And if this church-founding
sacrament brings your child into a living and
saving relation to the church, then why deny it
that baptism? Dare you reverse the divine procedure
which God has ordained for the salvation
of His people? And if Christ is related to the
individual only through the general; if He is related
to the members only through the body, and
having fellowship with them only as the Head of
that body, then is it not plain that your children,
in order to come to Him as such, to be incorporated
with Him and related to Him in a saving
way, must come to Him through the church,&mdash;must
become a member of it, and that too in the

manner and through the medium He has prescribed,
viz., baptism?</p>

<p class="dgp">He who, for the reason, therefore, that children
can have no self-conscious faith, refuses to have
them baptized, but exposes his ignorance of the
divine procedure of grace as developed in the
church, of the true moral relation between parent
and child, and of the scripture idea of the
Christian home. Why not for the very same reason
refuse to teach them, to have them pray, to
bring them up to church service? Yea, why not
deny to them salvation itself? For the very same
reason for which you reject infant baptism, you
must also reject infant salvation; for faith is held
up in the Word of God as a qualification for salvation
with more emphasis than as a qualification
for baptism. Hence if you say that infants cannot
be baptized because incapable of faith, you
must also say, by a parity of reasoning, that infants
cannot be saved, because incapable of faith.</p>

<p class="dgp">This is a dilemma, and to avoid it, some enemies
to infant baptism have even confessed that
they see no hope for the salvation of children.
Thus Dr. Alexander Carson says, "The gospel
has nothing to do with infants. It is good news,
but to infants it is no news at all. None can
be saved by the gospel who do not believe it!
Consequently by the gospel no infants can be
saved!" But if out of Christ there is no salvation,
then tell me, how will infants be saved?
We have no answer from these enemies, yea,
there is no answer!</p>



<p class="dgp">Christian parents! what think you of this?
When bending over the grave of a beloved child,
with the cherished hope of meeting it in heaven,
how would such intelligence as this startle you
from your dream of reunion there, and cast a deep
pall of desolation around your sorrowing hearts?
Does not the parent&#8217;s faith forbid the intrusion of
a doctrine so revolting as this? Though you have
been in your home, the divinely appointed representative
of your child, and in its baptism exercised
faith in its behalf, on the ground of those
natural and moral relations which the Lord has
constituted between you and your child, yet in
this startling dogma of the enemies of its baptism,
you find a virtual denial of the existence of
such moral relations and parental vicarage; yea,
a denial of parental stewardship and of the religious
ministry of the Christian home. The revulsion
with which the Christian heart receives such
a denial of infant baptism is at least a presumptive
evidence against it. But we think enough
has been said to lay the foundation of some practical
comments upon the subject of Christian baptism.</p>

<p class="dgp">If it is a fact that infants are proper subjects of
baptism, then it is the duty of Christian parents
to have them baptized. It is not only a duty, but
a delightful privilege, to consecrate them to God
in a perpetual covenant never to be forgotten,
regarding them as the members of the kingdom
of Christ, and so called to be God&#8217;s children by
adoption and grace.</p>



<p class="dgp">Their baptism involves many parental duties
and responsibilities. If it is both a sign and a
seal of the covenant of grace, and a means of
grace, so that the parent&#8217;s faith, in their baptism,
places the child in covenant relation to the Incarnate
Word, through the life-giving Spirit, then it
is plain that the parent is bound to secure for the
child those blessings which that baptism contemplates,
and which hang upon the exercise of a receiving
faith. This sacrament gives the child a
churchly claim upon parental interposition in its
behalf, in all things pertaining to its spiritual culture,&mdash;in
a true religious training, in a proper
direction in the use of the means of grace, in
a holy Christian example. Here it is the parent&#8217;s
duty to represent the church, to act for the
church in religious ministrations to the child, to
be the steward of the church in the Christian
home, to rear up the child for a responsible membership.</p>

<p class="dgp">No parent, therefore, who neglects the baptism
of the child, can have "the answer of a good conscience
towards God." If we are satisfied to have
our homes separate from the church; if we are
satisfied with individualistic, disembodied, unassociated
christianity,&mdash;a religion that owns no
church, but which has its origin, root and maturity
in the self-conscious activity of the individual,
we may then neglect this duty. But in
doing so, to be consistent, we must also discard the
sister ordinance of the Lord&#8217;s supper, yea, all the
churchly means of grace; yea, the church itself;

for why repudiate one ordinance,&mdash;one idea of
associated Christianity, and not all the others?</p>

<p class="dgp">That baptism is greatly abused and neglected,
none will deny. It is often abused by neglect of
the proper time of its administration. The earliest
period of infancy is the proper time; for then
there will be a proper correspondence in time
between the dedication and the baptism. In this
we have an example from Jewish circumcision.
The pious Jew took the infant when it was but
eight days old, and had it circumcised. But
many Christian parents defer the baptism of
their children until late childhood, while their
vows of dedication are left in mere naked feeling
and resolution, having no sacramental force and
expression; and as a consequence will grow cold
and indifferent. When parents thus delay having
their children brought within the fold of God
and the bosom of the church, they presume to be
wiser than God, and oppose their own weak
reason to His word and promises.</p>

<p class="dgp">Baptism is often abused, also, by being used
as a mere habit, an unmeaning form, without a
proper sense of its significance, importance, duties
and responsibilities. It is administered because
others do the same,&mdash;because customary
among most church members, and because perhaps
it looks like an adherence to the outward
of christianity and the church at least. When
they have thus obeyed the law of habit, and girded
themselves with the formula of parental duty,
they feel they have done enough; and perhaps

neither their children nor the vows they assumed
at their baptism ever after recur to them
as objects of specific duty.</p>

<p class="dgp">But we would remind such parents, that habit
is not always duty, and our adherence to habit
does not prove our sincerity and the truthfulness
of our purpose. It does not always imply "the
answer of a good conscience towards God." If
having our children baptized is simple obedience
to the law of habit, it is not the performance of
a parental duty, but the abuse of a blessed privilege;
there is in it all no living churchly expression
of willing vows. In this way we only reach
its outward form, and we do that, not because of
its inherent worth, not because of a duty and
privilege; but because we desire to cope with
others, and decorate our religion in the popular
dress of other people&#8217;s habits.</p>

<p class="dgp">Baptism is also abused by mistaking the object
and design of its administration. Why do
many parents have their children baptized? Because
they wish to express their vows of dedication
in that sacramental form and way which
God has appointed? Because they desire to
bring them into the fold and bosom of the
church, and place them in saving relations to
the means of grace? Alas, no! but too often
because they make their baptism the mere occasion
of giving them, in a formal, public way,
their Christian names. They christen their
children to give them a name; and often with
them this holy sacrament is as empty as the

name. Their baptism, in their view, is but the
sealing and confirming the name they had before
chosen for the child; and when this is done they
have no more thought of the baptism. With
them the baptism of their children is the ordinance
of name-giving. Before it takes place
they are busied about getting a name from the
most approved, and fashionable novels of the
day. This takes the place of dedication. Their
prior thoughts are all absorbed in getting a
strange, new-fangled name,&mdash;such an one as will
carry you away by association to some love-sick
tale, or remind you of the burning of Rome, or
some other deed which has disgraced humanity.
And then as soon as this is done, they fix upon
some auspicious occasion when either in the
church or in the presence of a select company
at home, (for children cry now-a-days too much
to bring them to church) they have their pastor
to baptize them.</p>

<p class="dgp">Perhaps a great feast is prepared; godfathers
and godmothers (if they have the warrant of
some valuable presents) are chosen; and then
in all the glare and parade of fashion, they have
the ordinance administered. And what then is
the first joyful cry of the fond parents, after the
solemn ceremony is ended? Why "now, dear,
you have your name!" And this is the end,&mdash;yes,
the finale of the vows there made before
God,&mdash;the end of all until God shall call them
to account!</p>

<p class="dgp">It requires but very little discrimination to see

that in all this the nature, design, and obligations
of Christian baptism are left totally out of view.
They do not here appreciate this ordinance as a
channel for the communication of God&#8217;s grace to
their children. When baptized they do not regard
them as having been received into gracious
relation to God, as plants in the Lord&#8217;s vineyard,
as having put on Christ, and as having their ingrafting
into Him not only signified but sealed.
Thus being undervalued, it is, as a consequence,
abused and neglected.</p>

<p class="dgp">The great neglect of Christian baptism is doubtless
owing to the low, unscriptural views of its
nature and practical importance; for if they realized
its relations to the plan of salvation, and its
office in the appropriation of that salvation to
their children, they would not permit them to
grow up unbaptized, neither would they be recreant
to the solemn duties which are binding
upon the parent after its administration. But
upon the subject of baptism itself, we have seen
that there is great laxity of feeling and opinion.</p>

<p class="dgp">The spirit of our fathers upon this point is becoming
so diluted that we can scarcely discern
any longer a vestige of the good old landmarks
of their sacramental character. Instead of walking
in them, Christians are now falling a prey to a
latitudinarian spirit of the most destructive kind.
They are, in leaving these old landmarks, falling
into the clutches of rationalism and radicalism,
which will ere long leave their homes and their
church</p>



<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"A wreck at random driven,</p>
<p class="l">Without one glimpse of reason or of heaven!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Even ministers themselves seem to grow indifferent
to this wide-spread and growing evil. They
hardly ever utter a word of warning from the pulpit
against it. Their members may be known by
them to neglect the baptism of their children; and
yet by their silence they wink at this dereliction;
and when they have occasion to speak of this ordinance,
many advert to it as a mere sign, as something
only outward, not communicating an invisible
grace, not as a seal of the new covenant,
ingrafting into Christ. No wonder when this
holy sacrament is thus disparagingly spoken of,
that Christian parents will neglect it practically,
as a redundancy in the church,&mdash;as a tradition
coming in its last wailing cry from ages and forms
departed,&mdash;as a church rite marked obsolete, as
an old ceremonial savoring of old Jewish shackles,
embodying no substantial grace, and unfit for this
age of railroad progression and gospel libertinism.</p>

<p class="dgp">Will any one deny the extent of such a spirit in
the church and homes of the present day? Let
him refer to church statistics, where he may receive
some idea of the magnitude of this evil. In
them we can see the extent to which parents have
neglected the baptism of their children. We take
from a note in the "Mercersburg Review" the
following statistical items: "The presbytery of
Londonderry reports but one baptism to sixty-four
communicants; the presbytery of Buffalo city, the

same; the presbytery of Rochester city, one to
forty-six; the presbytery of Michigan, one to
seventy-seven; the presbytery of Columbus, one
to thirty. In the presbytery of New Brunswick,
there are three churches which report thus: one
reports three hundred and forty-three communicants,
and three baptisms; another reports three
hundred and forty communicants, and two baptisms.
In Philadelphia, one church reports three
hundred and three communicants, and seven baptisms;
another, two hundred and eighty-seven
communicants, and one baptism."</p>

<p class="dgp">These statistics speak volumes. They tell us
how Christian parents neglect the baptism of
their children, and also how the church winks
at it. And from this neglect we can easily infer
their indifference to it. If we refer to the statistics
of all other churches, we shall witness a
similar neglect. No branch of the church now
is free from the imputation of such neglect. It
is now difficult indeed, to induce parents to have
their children baptized, because they think it is
no use! "Let them wait," say they, "till they
grow up, and then they will know more about
it!" This shows us where the parent stands,
viz., in an unchurchly state, and radical to the
very core. It shows us what that influence is,
which is at work upon his mind. "He will
know more about it!"&mdash;just as if that in religion
is worthless until we know all about it. Baptism
then is not worth anything until the child
understands all about it! In that parental utterance

we hear the wildest shout of triumphant
rationalism!</p>

<p class="dgp">But again, baptism is often abused by parental
unfaithfulness to its obligations. In the baptism
of their children, parents solemnly vow to bring
them up in the nurture of the Lord, to train
them up in His holy ways, to teach them by
precept and example, to pray for them and teach
them the privilege of prayer. And yet how
grossly are these solemn vows left unperformed,
and even never thought of in all after life! Perhaps
the very opposite course is taken even on
the day of baptism. Parents! by this you endanger
your own souls as well as the souls of
your children. How will the memory of such
neglected duty and privilege sink with deepening
anguish in your souls, when you shall be
called hence to answer to God for your parental
stewardship! Be not deceived; God is not
mocked; neither will he hold you guiltless when
you thus outrage His holy sacrament.</p>

<p class="dgp">Baptism is often abused by the unfaithfulness
of children to its privileges, influences and blessings.
Many children fight against these, prevent
parents from performing their duties, and repel
all the overtures of the Christian home, all the
offers of the Spirit&#8217;s baptism, abandoning the
means of grace, refusing to assume the baptismal
engagement taken for them by their parents;
and thus, so far as they are concerned, undo and
neutralize what their parents did for them. Oh,
ye baptized children,&mdash;ye to whom the holy ministry

of home has been faithfully applied,&mdash;know
ye not that the frowns of abused heaven are upon
you, and that the memory of your rebellion
against the prerogatives of the family, will constitute
an ingredient in your cup of woe? The
privilege of baptism lays you under solemn requisition.
If unfaithful to it, it will be your condemnation,
and add new fuel to the flame of a
burning conscience.</p>

<p class="dgp">Parents and children! be faithful to this holy
ordinance of God. It is a solemn service. You
should approach the baptismal font with a trembling
step and a consecrated heart. And what
a solemn moment it is, when you take your child
away from that altar! There you gave it up to
God,&mdash;dedicated it to His service; and there in
turn He commits it to you in trust, saying to you
as Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter said to the mother of Moses,
"Take this child and nurse it for me, and I
will pay thee thy wages," and you bore it away,
as did that faithful mother, to bring it up for
God. There you solemnly promised that in
training that child, the will of God should be
your will, and the law of all your conduct
towards it. You can never forget that solemn
transaction, and how you there vowed before
witnessing men and angels that you would be
faithful to the little one God has given you.
What now has been the result? Eternity will
answer.</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XII&mdash;Christian Names.</h2>

<div class="display"><p class="noindent">"She named the child Ichabod."&mdash;1 SAMUEL.</p></div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Thus was the building left</p>
<p class="l">Ridiculous, and the work confusion named."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Christian baptism suggests Christian names.
This introduces us to an important topic, viz., the
kind of names Christian parents should give to
their children at their baptism. Baptismal names
are indeed an important item of the Christian
home. Much more depends upon them than we
are at first sight of the subject, disposed to grant.</p>

<p class="dgp">Christianity eminently includes the great law
of correspondence between its inward spirit and
its outward form. Its form and contents cannot
be separated. The principle of fitness, it everywhere
exhibits; and hence its nomenclature is
the herald of its spirit and truth. The names
that religion has given to her followers signify
some principle of association between them.
They were adopted to designate some fact in

the history of the individual, or in his relation
to the church. Hence the names adopted for
the children of the Christian home should be
the utterance of some fact or calling which belongs
to that home. Their name is one of the
first things which children know, and hence it
makes a deep impression upon them. And as
our Christian names are given to us at the time
of our baptism, one would think that there is
always a correspondence between the name and
some fact or interest connected with the occasion.
We should then receive a Christian name, a name
which does not bind us by the laws of association
to what is evil either in the past or the present,
but which indicates a relation to some precious
boon involved in the dedication of the child to
God.</p>

<p class="dgp">Is this always so? By no means. It once was.
It was so in the Hebrew home and in the families
of the apostolic age. But in this day of parental
rage after new-fangled things and names, taken
from works of fiction and novels of doubtful
character, we find that parents care but very
little about the baptismal name being the herald
of a religious fact. "What is in a name?" was
a question propounded by a poet. His answer
was "nothing!"</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "That which we call a rose</p>
<p class="l">By any other name would smell as sweet."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The principle here evolved is false. There is
much in a name; and at the creation names were

not mechanically given to things; but there was
a vital correspondence between the name and the
thing named. Much depends upon the name.
It exerts a potent influence for good, or for evil
upon the bearer and upon all around him.</p>

<p class="dgp">Primarily, a name supposed some correspondence
between its meaning and the person who
bore it. Hence the name should not be arbitrary
in its application, but should "link its fitness to
idea," and with the person, run in parallel courses.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"For mind is apt and quick to wed ideas and names together,</p>
<p class="l">Nor stoppeth its perceptions to be curious of priorities."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, felt that
practically there was much in a name, when he
heathenized the names of the young Hebrew captives.
By this he thought to detach them from
their Hebrew associations. God was in each of
their original names, and in this way they were
reminded of their religion. But the names this
Chaldee king gave them were either social or alluded
to the idolatry of Babylon. Their Hebrew
names were to them witnesses for God, mementoes
of the faith of their fathers; hence the king,
to destroy their influence, called Daniel, Belteshazzar,
i.e. "the treasurer of the god Bel;"
Hannaniah he called Shadrach, i.e. "the messenger
of the king;" Mishael he called Meshach,
i.e. "the devotee of the goddess Shesach."
He showed his cunning in this, and a
historical testimony to the potent influence of a
name.</p>



<p class="dgp">By this same rule of correspondence, Adam
doubtless named, by order of his Creator, the
things of nature as they struck his senses.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"He specified the partridge by her cry, and the forest prowler by</p>
<p class="l">  his roving,</p>
<p class="l">The tree by its use, and the flower by its beauty, and everything</p>
<p class="l">  according to its truth."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Hebrews obeyed the same law in naming
their children. With them there was a sacred
importance attached to the giving of a name.
For every chosen name they had a reason which
involved the person&#8217;s life, character or destiny.
Adam named the companion of his bosom, "woman
because she was taken out of man." He
called "his wife&#8217;s name Eve, because she was
the mother of all living." Eve called her first-born
Cain (possession) "because I have gotten
a man from the Lord." She called another son
Seth (appointed,) "for God hath appointed me
another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew."
Samuel was so named because he was "asked
of and sent to God." God Himself often gave
names to His people; and each name thus given,
conveyed a promise, or taught some rule of life,
or bore some divine memorial, or indicated some
calling of the person named. Says Dr. Krummacher
on this point: "Names were to the people
like memoranda, and like the bells on the
garments of the priests, reminding them of the
Lord and His government, and furnishing matter
for a variety of salutary reflections. To the receivers

of them they ministered consolation and
strength, warning and encouragement; and to
others they served to attract the attention and
heart of God." This was right, and fully accorded
with the economy of the Hebrew home,
and with the conception of language itself.</p>

<p class="dgp">Would that the Christian home followed her
pious example! But Christians now are too
much under the influence of irreligious fashion.
Instead of giving their children those good old religious
names which their fathers bore, and which
are endeared to us by many hallowed associations,
they now repudiate them with a sneer as too vulgar
and tasteless. They are out of fashion, too
common, don&#8217;t lead us into a labyrinth of love-scrapes
and scenes of refined iniquity, and are
now only fit for a servant.</p>

<p class="dgp">Hence instead of resorting to the bible for a
name, these sentimental parents will pore over
filthy novels, or catch at some foreign accent,
to get a name which may have a fashionable
sound, and a claim upon the prevailing taste of
the times, and which may remind one of the
battles of some ambitious general, or of the
adventures of some love-sick swain, or of the
tragic deeds of some fashionable libertine!</p>

<p class="dgp">And when such a name is found to suit the ear
of fashion and of folly, it is applied to the child,
and reiterated by the minister before the baptismal
font; and as often as it is afterwards repeated
it reminds one perhaps of deeds which put modesty
to blush, and startle the ear of justice and

humanity. What a burning shame is this to the
Christian home! The child who is cursed with
such a name has ever before him the memorandum
of his parent&#8217;s folly, and as a recognized example,
the character of him after whom he has
been named. As often as he is hailed by it, he
blushes to think that he has been called by pious
parents after one who, perhaps, has turned many
a home into desolation, and disgraced and blighted
forever the fond hopes and joys of the young and
old.</p>

<p class="dgp">Have thoughts and associations like these no
demoralizing influence? How can parents admonish
their children against novel reading after
they have taken their names from novels? The
giving of Christian names at the present time is
indeed a ridiculous farce, an insult to christianity,
and a representation of stoical infidelity before the
baptismal altar. It is there an act of the Babylonish
king to heathenize the child. We might
almost say that the folly has become a rage. The
rage for new names especially,&mdash;names which do
not adorn the sacred page, nor carry us back to
the times and faith of our fathers, but which have
gained notoriety in the world of fiction, and associate
us with the lover&#8217;s affrays and with the desperado&#8217;s
feats,&mdash;these are the names which Christian
parents too often seek with avidity for their
children. If you were to judge their homes by
these names, you would think yourself in a Turkish
seraglio, or amid the voluptuous scenes of a
Parisian court, or in the bosom of a heathen family.

What, for instance, is there about such names
as Nero, Cæsar, Pompey, Punch, that would remind
you that you were in a Christian home?</p>

<p class="dgp">It is often disgusting, too, to see how some
Christian parents, who live in humble life, seek
to ape, in their children, the empty sounding titles
of the world. They only show their vanity and
weakness, and often bring ridicule upon their children;
for&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"To lend the low-born noble names, is to shed upon them ridicule and evil;</p>
<p class="l">Yea, many weeds run rank in pride, if men have dubbed them cedars,</p>
<p class="l">And to herald common mediocrity with the noisy notes of fame,</p>
<p class="l">Tendeth to its deeper scorn, as if it were to call the mole a mammoth."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When we thus give our children names associated
with battle-fields, empty titles, brilliant honors,
and lucrative offices,&mdash;positions in life which they
can never expect to reach, and which, if they did,
would not do honor to the child of a Christian
family, we do them great injury; we fasten in
them feelings the most disastrous, and draw out
propensities unbecoming the child devoted to the
Lord, breeding in his soul a peevish repining at
his station. Alas! that Christian homes should
ever become so servile in their devotions to the
rotten sentiments and flimsy interests of misguided
and perverted fashion! Her smile in
your home is that of a harlot; her touch is the

withering blight of corruption; her dominion is
the desolation of family hopes and the extermination
of those sacred prerogatives with which the
Lord has invested the Christian fireside. The ball
will take the place of prayer; novels will take the
place of the bible; favorites will take the place
of husbands and wives; and the children will regard
their parents only as their masters.</p>

<p class="dgp">Christian parents should, therefore, give suitable
names to their children, that is, such names as
will correspond with their state, character and relations
to God,&mdash;names which do not suggest the
idea of war, rapine, humbug, romance, and sensuality,
but which are associated with the Christian
life and calling, and which serve as a true
index to the spirit and character of the parental
fireside. Reason, as well as faith, will dictate such
a choice; for</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"There is wisdom in calling a thing fitly; names should note particulars</p>
<p class="l">Through a character obvious to all men, and worthy of their instant acceptation."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Our name is the first and the last possession at
our disposal. It determines from the days of
childhood our inclinations. It employs our attention
through life, and even transports us beyond
the grave. Hence we should give appropriate
names to our children,&mdash;such as will interest
them, and neither be a reproach, on the one
hand, nor reach to unattainable and unworthy
heights, on the other; for the mind of your

child will take a bias, from its name, to good
or to evil.</p>

<p class="dgp">Why not adopt scriptural names for them?
Are they not as beautiful as other names? They
are. And is not their influence as salutary? It
is. And are they not more suitable for the Christian
home than any other? They are. Where
is there a more lovely name than Mary,&mdash;lovely
in its utterance, and thrice lovely in the glowing
memories which cluster around it, and in
the hallowed home-associations it awakens in
the Christian heart, drawing us at once to the
feet of Jesus, where a Mary sat in confiding
pupilage, and sealed her instructions and gratitude
with the tear-drop that glowed like early
dew upon her dimpled cheek? Would Christian
parents desire to give their children more
beautiful names,&mdash;beautiful in the light of history
and of heaven,&mdash;than that of Benjamin,
"son of the right hand;" of David, "dear, beloved;"
of Dionysius, "divinely touched;" of
Eleazar, "help of God;" of Eli, "my offering;"
of Enoch, "dedicated;" of Jacob, "my
present;" of Lemuel, "God is with them;"
of Nathan, "given, gift;" of Nathaniel, "gift
of God;" of Samuel, "asked of God and sent
of God," &amp;c.?</p>

<p class="dgp">Besides, there are names of distinguished
Christians, such as Wilberforce, Howard, Page,
Martyn, Paul, Peter, John, Fenelon, Clement,
Baxter, &amp;c.,&mdash;bright as dew-drops on the page
of history, and as beautiful in their enunciation

as any chosen from the world of heartless fashion,&mdash;as
beautiful in sound, and infinitely more so in
associations which bind them to deeds of humanity
and Christian love. The utterance of such
names would be more becoming the Christian
home; because they aid in developing the purest,
holiest and loftiest idea of its nature and calling.
Such names will bind your little ones to pure and
holy persons and deeds, and will suit the book of
life in which you hope to have them enrolled.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Then, safe within a better home, where time and its titles are not found,</p>
<p class="l">God will give thee His new name, and write it on thy heart;</p>
<p class="l">A name, better than of sons, a name dearer than of daughters,</p>
<p class="l">A name of union, peace and praise, as numbered in thy God."</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XIII&mdash;Home As A Nursery.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The Ostrich, silliest of the feathered kind,</p>
<p class="l">And formed of God without a parent&#8217;s mind,</p>
<p class="l">Commits her eggs, incautious, to the dust,</p>
<p class="l">Forgetful that the foot may crush the trust;</p>
<p class="l">And, while on public nurseries they rely,</p>
<p class="l">Not knowing, and too oft not caring why,</p>
<p class="l">Irrational in what they thus prefer</p>
<p class="l">No few, that would seem wise, resemble her."</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">To nurse means to educate or draw out and
direct what exists in a state of mere involution.
It means to protect, to foster, to supply with
appropriate food, to cause to grow or promote
growth, to manage with a view to increase. Thus
Greece was the nurse of the liberal arts; Rome
was the nurse of law. In horticulture, a shrub
or tree is the nurse or protector of a young and
tender plant. We are said to nurse our national
resources. Isaiah, in speaking of the coming
Messiah and the glory of his church, says, "Thy
daughters shall be nursed at thy side." "Kings

shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy
nursing mothers."</p>

<p class="dgp">The place or apartment appropriated to such
nursing is called a nursery. Thus a plantation
of young trees is called a nursery. Shakspeare
calls Padua the nursery of arts. We call a very
bad place the nursery of thieves and rogues.
Dram-shops are the nurseries of intemperance.
Commerce is called the nursery of seamen. Universities
are the nurseries of the arts and sciences.
The church on earth is called the nursery of the
church in heaven. Christian families are called
the nurseries of the church on earth, because in
the former its members are nursed and propagated
for the purpose of being transplanted into the
latter.</p>

<p class="dgp">In the same sense and for the same reason, the
Christian home is the nursery of the young,&mdash;of
human nature in its normal state. And as home
is the nursery of the state as well as of the
church on earth and in heaven, we must see that
it is a physical, intellectual and religious nursery.
We shall briefly consider it in these aspects. Indeed
the Christian home cannot be considered in
a more interesting and responsible light. The
little child, dedicated to God in holy baptism, is
entirely helpless and dependent upon the ministrations
of the nursery. There is the department
of its first impressions, of its first directions,
of its first intellectual and moral formation,
of the first evolution of physical and moral
life. There the child exists as but the germ of

what is to be. It grows up under the fostering
care and plastic power of the parents. God&#8217;s
commission to them in the nursery is, to bring
up these germs of life, in His nurture admonition.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Take the germ, and make it</p>

<p class="noindent">The nursery is the department of home in
which the mother fulfils her peculiar mission.
This is her special sphere. None can effectually
take her place there. She is the center of attraction,
the guardian of the infant&#8217;s destiny;
and none like she, can overrule the unfolding
life and character of the child. God has fitted
her for the work of the nursery. Here she
reigns supreme, the arbitress of the everlasting
weal or woe of untutored infancy. On her
the fairest hopes of educated man depend, and
in the exercise of her power there, she sways a
nation&#8217;s destiny, gives to the infant body and
soul their beauty, their bias and their direction.
She there possesses the immense force of first
impressions. The soul of her child lies unveiled
before her, and she makes the stamp of her own
spirit and personality upon its pliable nature.
She there engrafts it, as it were, into her own
being, and from the combined elements of her
own character, builds up and establishes the

character of her offspring. Hers will, therefore,
be the glory or the shame.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Then take the heart thy charms have won,</p>
<p class="l">And nurse it for the skies."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The nursery is that department of home in
which the formation of our character is begun.
Infancy demands the nursery. It is not full-formed
and equipped for the battle of life. It
lies in the cradle in a state of mere involution,
and in the hands of its parents is altogether passive,
and susceptible of impressions as wax before
the sun. The germ of the man is there;
but it has yet to be developed. Its indwelling
life must be nurtured with tender and assiduous
care. It demands an influence suited to the expansion
of its nature into bloom and maturity.
It demands physical development, mental evolution,
moral training, and spiritual elevation. In
order to these it must live amidst the sweet and
plastic socialities of maternal relationship. It
must come under the fostering influence of a
mother&#8217;s heart, and be reared up by the tender
touches of a mother&#8217;s hand. This idea is embodied
in home as a nursery. This is fourfold in its
conception and relation to the child.</p>

<p class="dgp">The nursery is physical. This involves the
means of keeping the child in health, and the
appliances of a vigorous physical development.
The Christian mother, to this end, should make
herself acquainted with the physiology of the
infant body. Many well-meaning mothers, from

sheer ignorance, destroy the health of their children;
and it is on this account perhaps that four-tenths
of them die under five years of age. They
should also consider the bearing of the body
upon the mind and morals of their children.
How often do ignorant and indolent parents, by
giving their children over to the care of sickly
and immoral nurses, ruin forever the health and
souls of their offspring. Much, then, depends
upon the physical nurture of your child. If you
would not injure its mind and soul, you must
nurse its body with tender care and wisdom. A
vital bond unites them; they reciprocally influence
each other, and hence what affects the one
must have a corresponding influence upon the
other. Neglect the body of your child; destroy
its health either by extreme and fastidious care,
or by a brutal neglect, and you at the same time
do lasting injury to its mind and morals; for the
body as the vehicle of mind and spirit, is used for
spiritual ends, and should, therefore, be nurtured
with direct reference to these.</p>

<p class="dgp">Your child, in the nursery, is like the tender
plant. The storm of passion and the chill of indifference
and the oppression of parental tyranny
should not be heard and felt there; for where the
storm rages and coldness freezes and the hand
of cruelty oppresses, we can have no beautiful
and vigorous development of physical or moral
powers. There will be a stinted and one-sided
growth. At best it will be dwarfish, and tend to
counteract the spontaneous outflow of mental

and moral life. The tender plant, when, cramped
and clogged by existing impediments, cannot
spring up into beauteous maturity. Neither can
your child, when crammed with sweetmeats, and
oppressed and screwed into monstrous contortions
by the cruel inquisition of fashion and fashionable
garments.</p>

<p class="dgp">In this way the misdirected love and cruel
pride of mothers often destroy the health and
beauty of their children. They cause a sickly
and dwarfish growth by too much confinement
and mental taxation, by a too rigid choice of diet,
by daily, uncalled for decoctions of medicine, and
by fitting the body in a dress as the Chinese do
their children&#8217;s feet in shoes; in a word, by making
the entire nursery life too artificial, and substituting
the laws of art for those of nature. The
result must be a delicate, artificial constitution,
too fragile for the trials and duties of life. The
body of your child has not the blooming, blushing
form of nature, but the cold marble cast of a
statue; and it imprints itself upon the disposition,
the spirit, the mental faculties. It shows
itself in peevishness, in imbecility, in such a passive,
slavish subjection to the rules and interests
of mere artificial life, as to admit no hope almost
of spiritual progression.</p>

<p class="dgp">The nursery is also intellectual. The mind of
your child is unfolding as well as its body; and
hence the former, as well as the latter, demands
the nursery. How much of the mental vigor
and attainments of children depend upon the

prudent management of the nursery. Hence
parents should</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Exert a prudent care</p>
<p class="l">To feed our infant minds with proper fare;</p>
<p class="l">And wisely store the nursery by degrees</p>
<p class="l">With wholesome learning, yet acquired with ease.</p>
<p class="l">And thus well-tutored only while we share</p>
<p class="l">A mother&#8217;s lectures and a nurse&#8217;s care."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Parents may abuse the minds of their children
in the nursery, either by total neglect, or by immature
education, by too early training and too
close confinement to books at a very early age,
thus taxing the mind beyond its capacities. This
is often the case when children betray great precocity
of intellect; and the pride of the parent
seeks to gratify itself through the supposed gift
of the child. In this way parents often reduce
their children to hopeless mental imbecility.</p>

<p class="dgp">Again, parents often injure the minds of their
children by their misguided efforts to train the
mind. Even in training them to speak, how imprudent
they are in calling words and giving
ideas in mutilated language. It is just as easy to
teach children to speak correctly, and to call all
things by their proper names, as to abuse their
vernacular tongue. Such mutilations are impediments
to the growth of the intellect. The child
must afterwards be taught to undo what it was
taught to do and say in the nursery. But as this
subject will be fully considered in the chapter on
Home Education, we shall refrain from further
comment here.</p>



<p class="dgp">The nursery is moral and spiritual. The first
moral and religious training of the child belongs
to the nursery, and is the work of the mother.
Upon her personal exhibition of truth, justice,
virtue, &amp;c., depends the same moral elements in
the character of her child. In the nursery we
receive our first lessons in virtue or in vice, in
honesty or dishonesty, in truth or in falsehood, in
purity or in corruption. The full-grown man is
the matured child morally as well as physically
and intellectually. The same may be said of
the spiritual formation and growth of the child.
Spiritual culture belongs eminently to the nursery.
There the pious parent should begin the
work of her child&#8217;s salvation.</p>

<p class="dgp">From what we have now seen of the nursery,
we may infer its very common abuse by Christian
parents in various ways. They abuse it either by
forsaking its duties, or giving it over to nurses.
The whole subject warns parents against giving
over their children to dissolute nurses. What a
blushing shame and disgrace to the very name of
Christian mother, it is for her to throw the whole
care and responsibility of the nursery upon hired
and irreligious servants. And why is this so
often done? To relieve the mother from the
trouble of her children, and afford her time and
opportunity to mingle unfettered in the giddy
whirl of fashionable dissipation. In circles of
opulent society it would now be considered a
drudgery and a disgrace for mothers to attend
upon the duties of this responsible department

of home. But the nurse cannot be a substitute
for the mother.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Then why resign into a stranger&#8217;s hand</p>
<p class="l">A task so much within your own command,</p>
<p class="l">That God and Nature, and your interest too</p>
<p class="l">Seem with one voice to delegate to you?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The same may be said of boarding schools, to
which many parents send their children to rid
themselves of the trouble of training them up.
They are sent there at the very age in which they
mostly need the fostering care of a parent.
There they soon become alienated from home,
and lose the benefit of its influence; and there
too they often contract habits and are filled with
sentiments the most degenerating and corrupt.
They grow up and enter society without any conscious
relation to home, and as a consequence, regard
society as a mere heartless conventionalism.
To this part of the subject we shall, in another
chapter, devote special attention. It demands
the prayerful consideration of Christian parents.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Why hire a lodging in a house unknown,</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">Where shall we find a more exquisite picture
of home-sympathy than this, from the pen of that
truly pious woman, Hannah More! We consider
the home-sympathy as an argument against
the neglect and abuse of the nursery. It is the
instinctive impulse of the parent&#8217;s heart to be
faithful to the trust of home. What mother,
prompted by such sympathy, can be recreant to
the duties of her household? Can she, keenly
sensible to the danger of her children, anxious

for their welfare, prompt to do them justice,
eager to procure them interests and joys, yearning
to alleviate their misfortunes, push them
from her arms, and give them over to the care of
unfeeling and immoral nurses? If among all the
members of the Christian home</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "There is a holy tenderness,</p>
<p class="l">A nameless sympathy, a fountain love,&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Branched infinite from parents to children,</p>
<p class="l">From husband to wife, from child to child,</p>
<p class="l">That binds, supports, and sweetens human life,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">then the law of sympathy is the standard of faithfulness
to the loved ones of home, and its violation
is an abuse of the affections and faith of the
heart. We shall now consider the natural and
spiritual sympathy of home.</p>

<p class="dgp">What are the natural elements of home-sympathy?
The original meaning of sympathy is "harmony
of the affections." As such it is an instinctive
element of human nature. "Sympathy,"
says Adams in his Elements of Christian Science,
"is a natural harmony by which, upon
matters especially that concern the affections, one
human being shall, under certain conditions, feel,
feel in despite of all concealment of language,
the real state of the other." It is, in a word, that
law of our nature which makes the feeling of one
become affected in the same way as are the feelings
of another, so that, in obedience to this law,
"we rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep
with them that weep." In order to this the motive

need not be the same in those in whom the
feeling is the same; for that feeling engenders a
feeling of its own kind in the other, independent
of similar motive. Home-sympathy is that primary
power of the heart by which all the affections
of one member are extended to all the other
members. It awakens in each for all the others,
those delicate sensibilities which impel to the
most self-denying and benevolent acts. The parent
who sympathizes with the child, will extend
to it all the aids within a parent&#8217;s ability.</p>

<p class="dgp">Its nature is to yield more of itself to weeping
than to rejoicing, to misery than to joy. The
parent will exert more power and do more for the
wretched child than for those of his children who
are not in the same condition. He will leave the
latter in their security, and seek the one lost
sheep of his little flock. Thus it exerts a sheltering
influence against the dangers and miseries
of human life. It is the law of home-preservation,
written upon the heart, obeyed by the affections,
and impelling each member to yield
a voluntary devotion to the welfare of all the
others. It is this which makes it one of the
most lovely attributes of home. It is one of the
golden chains that link its members together in
close unity, making one heart of the many that
are thus fused together, and blending into beautiful
unison their specific feelings, and hopes and
interests.</p>

<p class="dgp">It is, therefore, the law of oneness in the family,
weaving together, like warp and woof, the existence

of the members, and locking each heart
into one great home-heart, "like the keys of an
organ vast," so that if one heart be out of tune,
the home-heart feels the painful jar, and gives
forth discordant sounds. By it we are not only
bound to our kindred, but to our friends, our nation,
our race. It impels us to all our acts of benevolence
even to an enemy. Earth would be a
dreary scene, and society would be a curse, if it
did not reign in human nature.</p>

<p class="dgp">Sympathy was a rich and interesting theme with
the ancients. It entered into all their philosophy
and religion, and gave rise to numerous fables.
They believed that sympathy was a miraculous
principle, and that it reigned in irrational and inanimate
things. Thus they thought that "two
harps being tuned alike, and one being played,
the chords of the other would follow the tune
with a faint, sympathetic music." It was also
believed that precious stones sympathized with
certain persons, that the stars sympathized with
men, that the efficacy of ointment depended upon
sympathy, that "wounds could be healed at a distance
by an ointment whose force depended upon
sympathy, the ointment being smeared upon the
weapon, not upon the wound."</p>

<p class="dgp">Upon this belief many erroneous, superstitious
and dangerous systems of philosophy and
religion were established. The natural philosophy
of Baptista Porta, or Albertus Magnus,
was founded upon the principle of sympathy.
Plato applied this principle to marriage, and

maintained that "marriage was the union of
two souls that once, in their preëxistent state,
were one, and that sympathy urges them to union
again, and sends them unconsciously seeking it
over the world." In the middle ages it was
maintained that two friends could be so moved
with mutual sympathy as to have, under certain
conditions, a true and perfect knowledge of one
another&#8217;s state, even when at a great distance
apart. To the revival of this erroneous view of
the law of sympathy may be ascribed the theories
of Mesmerism and spiritual rappings at the present
day.</p>

<p class="dgp">Home-sympathy, viewed as a feeling and a faculty,
is twofold in its nature, viz., passive and active.
As passive, it is the mere sense of harmony
of feeling among all the members, producing the
idea and feeling of the oneness of home. It makes
a unity of affection, so that the temper, hopes and
interests of each member have a living echo and
response in all the others. It gives to home its
unitive heart, preserves its vital coherence, fuses
all the hearts together, makes each a thread in
the web of home-being, where each finds its true
measure, is inspired with the home-feeling when
all is right, and oppressed with home-sickness
when separated from it.</p>

<p class="dgp">But home-sympathy is also active. As such
it is "the active power that one person has naturally
of entering into the feelings of another, and
being himself affected as that other is." Each
member of home has the power in his feelings

of making the feelings of all the other members
his own, though he may not have the causes of
the feelings of the one with whom he sympathizes.
Thus one friend may feel the grief of
another, actually and really, though he may not
suffer the loss of that friend. He can make the
emotion which that loss caused, his own. We
may weep with the mother who pours her floods
of anguish upon the grave of her child, though
we may not have sustained the same loss. The
husband weeps with his wife, though he may
not be able to feel the pangs which penetrate
her heart. The child can enter into the feelings
of the parent, and be affected to tears or to
joy by them.</p>

<p class="dgp">And thus the home-sympathy demands that all
the emotions of home, whether joyful or painful,
must affect all,&mdash;must vibrate from heart to heart.
It involves the power of home-transference, by
which, each member conveys to his own affections,
all within home. It is thus the law of
adaptation and assimilation, for the home-affections.
In obedience to this law the hearts and
interests of the members are bound up in beautiful
harmony. The necessities of one are supplied
by all. It is this which makes the members
faithful to each other, and prompts them to
deeds of disinterested love.</p>

<p class="dgp">It is, therefore, only when the home-sympathy,
as a feeling and a faculty, is carried out and acted
upon according to its instinctive impulses, that it
becomes an effective agent of good. This, however,

is not always done. Often it is neutralized
by not being permitted to express itself according
to the laws of its own operation. Many members
have acute feelings and great powers of
sympathy, but it exists in them only as feeling,
only as a stimulus, a sentiment, and is, therefore,
nothing but home-sentimentalism,&mdash;a disease of
home-sympathy. Thus, for instance, parents may
weep over the wickedness of their children, and
the pious wife may lament the impenitence of her
husband; but if they go no further, their sympathy
is really false, because it does not share in
and feel the state of others, nor seek to alleviate
their impending miseries. The home-sympathy
is not simply the look of the priest and Levite
upon the half-dead traveler, but also the help of
the good Samaritan. Its language is not only,
"Be ye clothed and fed," but also, "I will clothe
and feed thee." The mere indulgence in the feeling
of sympathy is but to harden the heart in the
end. Such were the sympathies of Rosseau,&mdash;mere
heart-stimuli, without legitimate deeds and
objective force, existing only as a love-sick sentiment.
And this was both the theme of his eloquence
and the cause of his misery. Such, too,
were the sympathies of Robespierre,&mdash;a mere
ebullition of disembodied sentiment, borne up
like a floating bubble upon muddy waters, and
exploding upon the slightest depression.</p>

<p class="dgp">But, on the other hand, when home-sympathy
is issued in faithful action as its emotions prompt,
it becomes an efficient agent in the happiness and

peace of the family. It not only gives eloquence
to the tongue, tears to the eye, but faithfulness to
the life. It serves as a key-note to the mind and
heart, framing the home-energy, revealing to us
our real state, and prompting, by the instinct of
love, the means for our highest welfare.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"How glows the joyous parent to descry,</p>
<p class="l">A guileless bosom true to sympathy!</p>
<p class="l">A long lost friend, or hapless child restored,</p>
<p class="l">Smiles at his blazing hearth and social board;</p>
<p class="l">Warm from his heart the tears of rapture flow,</p>
<p class="l">And virtue triumphs o&#8217;er remembered woe!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Sympathy is excited and measured by the
power of natural affection. In proportion to
the strength of the latter will be the attractive
power of the former. That soothing voice
which calms the wailing-infant; that fond bosom
from which the child draws its subsistence,
and on which it pillows its weary head; that
smile which throws a sunshine around its existence,
and all those acts of kindness administered
by the hand of love, draw the child instinctively
to the parent&#8217;s heart, and blend in sweetest union
its very being with theirs.</p>

<p class="dgp">The principle of home-sympathy reigns in some
degree in every household whose members have
not sunk below the level of the brute. Its nature
demands that it be mutual. It should glow with
peculiar warmth in the wife, the mother, and the
sister; because it is a more prominent instinct of
woman. It is an intuition of the mother&#8217;s heart.</p>



<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"When pain and anguish wring the brow,</p>
<p class="l">A ministering angel thou!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Who but she can smooth the pillow and soothe
the anguish of the child of affliction? There is a
tenderness in her nature, a softness in her touch,
a lightness in her step, a soothing expression in
her face, a tender beam in her eye, which man
can never have, and which eminently fits her for
the lead in home-sympathy. The want of it is a
libel upon her sex. It is her prerogative,&mdash;the
magic power she wields in the formation and reformation
of character.</p>

<p class="dgp">But her sympathy should find response in the
bosom of her husband, the father, the brother;
for, if true, it must he mutual. Their joys and
their sorrows must be common. Thus heart must
answer to heart, and face. "The cruelty of that
man," says J.A. James, "wants a name, and I
know of none sufficiently emphatic, who denies
his sympathy to a suffering woman, whose only
sin is a broken constitution, and whose calamity is
the result of her marriage." Without such mutual
sympathy, the members of the family would
be cold and repulsive, and society would be deprived
of its most lovely attributes; its members
would lose the connecting link which brings them
together, and its entire fabric would fall to pieces
and degenerate into barbaric individualism.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Had earth no sympathy, no tears would flow,</p>
<p class="l">In heart-felt sorrow, for another&#8217;s woe;</p>
<p class="l">The joyous spirit then would weary roam,</p>
<p class="l">A stranger to the dear delights of home."</p>
</div>



<p class="dgp">We shall now consider briefly the religious
elements of home-sympathy. These involve harmony
of the spiritual affections, and a transfer to
all the members, of the religious experience and
enjoyment of each. As natural sympathy arises
out of and is measured by natural affection, so
spiritual sympathy is the product of faith and
love. Hence the latter is purer, more refined
and efficient than the former. If the members
of the family are the children of God, they will
live together in the unity of the Spirit as well as
of natural affection. The sympathy of the pious
portion will be interposed in behalf of the salvation
of the impenitent members. There will
be an identity of soul-interest. The pious mother
will make the everlasting interests of her husband
and child, her own; and will labor with the
same assiduity to promote them as she does to
promote her own salvation. She will thus enter
into the spiritual emotions of her kindred, and
bear them vicariously, making thus her religious
sympathies the law of preservation to all the
members of her household.</p>

<p class="dgp">The living stream of this sympathy is given by
Christ in His address to the weeping daughters
of Jerusalem: "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your
children!" The following is also its living utterance:
"My son, if thy heart be wise, my heart
shall rejoice, even mine." We have also a beautiful
exhibition of it in the touching history of
Ruth, in the life of Joseph, and in the mother of

Samuel. Peter describes it when he says, "Be
all of one mind, having compassion one of another;
love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous."
Esther expresses it in the exclamation, "How can
I endure to see the destruction of my kindred!"
Paul gives utterance to it when he says, "I would
be accursed for my brethren and kindred&#8217;s sake."
Jesus exemplifies it in His intercourse with the
family of Lazarus; He shows its emotion and its
active charities when He stands on the grave of
that friend, and weeps, and calls him from the
dead. His sympathy for a lost world is the true
pattern of home-sympathy. It was disinterested,
superior to all selfishness, self-denying, active, and
prompting Him to do and suffer all that He did.
It was not measured by the merits of the object
after which it yearned. He sympathized with all,</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"For each He had a brother&#8217;s interest in His heart."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And its softening influence fell, like morning dew,
upon the heart of adamant, melting it into contrition
and love.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"In every pang that rends the heart,</p>
<p class="l">The Man of sorrows had a part;</p>
<p class="l">He sympathizes in our grief,</p>
<p class="l">And to the sufferer sends relief."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">See Him bend over the bed of Jairus&#8217;s daughter;
see Him opening the eyes of the blind, healing
the paralytic, comforting and feeding the poor
widow, and cheering the bereaved and troubled
heart. Wherever He went He was "a brother

born for them in adversity." See Him on the
cross, when weltering in blood and struggling
with the pangs of a cruel death, He casts His
languid eye upon His aged mother who is there
weeping her pungent woes, and makes provision
for her comfort. His sympathy now for all is the
same.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"None ever came unblest away;</p>
<p class="l">Then, though all earthly ties be riven,</p>
<p class="l">Smile, for thou hast a Friend in heaven!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is this sympathy which makes Him a member
of every Christian home. And when the sympathy
of its members is the reproduction of His,
they will, like Mary, sit in loving pupilage at His
feet, each becoming the agent of blessings for all
the rest. The wife will seek the salvation of her
husband; the mother will labor with unwearied
diligence for the redemption of her child.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus when home-sympathy is purified and developed
by Christian faith and love, it opens up
the most elevated of all home-feeling and solicitude,
and becomes the most effectual safeguard
against impending ruin. No family can be true
to its privileges and mission without it. It allures
to the cross, leads all the members in the path of
the sympathizing one, and prompts them to say,
"Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
following after thee; for whither thou goest I
will go, and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy
people shall be my people, and thy God my God;
where thou diest I will die, and there will I be

buried; the Lord do so to me, and more also, if
aught but death part thee and me."</p>

<p class="dgp">What would the Christian home be, therefore,
without such sympathy? Powerless, amoral desolation!
We read in God&#8217;s Word, of men losing
natural affection, and of mothers forgetting their
sucking children. But these were worse than
brutes. What shall we then say of Christian
parents being devoid of spiritual sympathy,&mdash;shedding
no tear of anguish over their moral
ruin, nor showing the least concern about their
salvation? Such parents do not rejoice even over
the return of their children to God. They are a
disgrace to the Christian name, and bring infamy
upon the Christian home.</p>

<p class="dgp">Some parents do not proceed quite so far.
They indulge in the feeling of sympathy for
their children; but alas! that feeling is never
expressed in efforts to save them. It is all expended
in vain and fruitless lamentations, and is,
therefore, at best but a morbid sentimentalism,&mdash;but
a cloak behind which are lurking parental
hard-heartedness and religious apathy; proving
plainly the great truth advanced by Adams, in
his Elements of Christian Science, "that an indulgence
in the feelings of sympathy without carrying
them out to the relief of actual distress, produces
hardness of heart to such a degree that the
most pitiless and cruel, the most licentious and
unnatural, and ungrateful conduct shall be joined
with the most overflowing and deeply thrilling
sentiment."</p>



<p class="dgp">Let those parents who are ever lamenting the
wickedness of their children, but do nothing to
make them better, ponder well this sentiment,
and see it in the grin, of their own hypocrisy,
and the desolation of their injured home and
children. Let the other members, as well as
the parents, take the timely warning. Let the
pious wife here see the character of her sympathy
for her impenitent husband. And let each see
that their pious sympathy "always issue forth in
actions." Let that sympathy give not only eloquence
to the tongue, tears to your eye, and
sighs to your heart, but also faithfulness to your
life and holy calling. As the cry of hunger from
your children, and their shivering cold in winter,
prompt you to provide for their natural wants, so
let their moral wants impel you to fidelity to their
souls. All will be vain without this. The stern
demands of a father&#8217;s authority, and the formal
teachings of a mother&#8217;s lip, will fall like the frost
of a winter&#8217;s morning, upon their tender hearts,&mdash;only
to sear and to harden and to freeze up the
heart against God. For</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"He will not let love&#8217;s work impart</p>
<p class="l">Full solace, lest it steal the heart."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But when pure and holy sympathy goes out, in
its softening influence after the young;&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Then, feeling is diffused in every part,</p>
<p class="l">Thrills in each nerve, and lives in all the heart."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Such sympathy has a saving influence upon both

the parent and the child. It softens and refines
the former, while it forms and allures the latter.
The child fondly leans upon the parents, looks up
to them for support and enjoyment, and is led by
them in whatever path they choose. By its influence
the feeling of natural and spiritual helplessness
becomes developed in the child; the sense of
dependence on a superior is awakened; and with
these, all those feelings of confidence and veneration,
which lay the foundation of religious affections,
are unfolded. The parent&#8217;s influence, both
as to kind and degree, depends, therefore, upon
the character of home-sympathy. If it is but
natural, the parental influence will not extend
beyond the worldly gain and temporal welfare of
the child. The parent will exert no power over
the soul. But if it be spiritual, and extend beyond
the mere instincts of natural affection, it
will expand the mind, and develop all the melting
charities of our nature. It will pass with a
new transferring and transforming power, from
husband to wife, from parent to child, from kindred
to kindred. Wherever it finds its way;
whatever fiber of the heart it may touch, it begets
a new and holy affection, unites the energies,
lightens the toils, soothes the sorrows, and exalts
the hopes, of all the members. It reflects a softening
luster from eye to eye, goes with electric
flash from heart to heart, glows in its warmth
throughout all its moral courses, accumulates the
home-endearments, stimulates each member to religious
exertions for all the rest, and lays the foundation

in each heart for an unbroken home-communion
of their sainted spirits in heaven! It
cements them together in their tent-home, creating
a sweet concord of hearts and hopes and joys;
and then elevates them unitedly in fond anticipation
of reunion in their eternal home. They
blend their tears together over the grave of buried
love, and enjoy the saintly sympathy of loved
ones gone before them.</p>

<p class="dgp">This is its most lovely feature. Tell me, is
there not a bond of sympathy between Jesus and
His people here,&mdash;between loved ones in heaven
and their pious kindred on earth? Do not the
tears of the Christian home reflect the tears of
Jesus? These are to the heart like the dews of
Hermon,&mdash;like the dews that descended upon the
mountains of Zion.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"No radiant pearl which crested fortune wears,</p>
<p class="l">No gem that, sparkling, hangs from beauty&#8217;s ears,</p>
<p class="l">Not the bright stars which night&#8217;s blue arch adorn,</p>
<p class="l">Nor rising sun that gilds the vernal morn,</p>
<p class="l">Shine with such luster as the tear that breaks</p>
<p class="l">For others&#8217; woe, down virtue&#8217;s lovely cheeks."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Is such, Christian brother, the sympathy of your
home? It will be a safeguard against the follies
and the false interests of life. It will restrict the
fashionable taste and sentiments of the age. It
will teach wisdom to the pious mother, and be a
sure defense against the dangers and indiscretions
of the nursery and fashionable boarding school.
Under its influence, mothers will not trust the

souls of their children to the guardianship of irreligious
nurses, nor expose them to the perils of a
corrupted and heartless fashion. They will deny
themselves the ruinous pleasures of a gay and
reckless association with the world; and with
maternal solicitude, attend upon the opening of
those buds of life which God has committed to
them. The pious mother will wield her power
over her children, by the force of this sympathy;
for her&#8217;s is the deepest, purest, and most saving
of all home-sympathy:</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Earth may chill</p>
<p class="l">And sever other sympathies, and prove</p>
<p class="l">How weak all human bonds are&mdash;it may kill</p>
<p class="l">Friendship, and crush hearts with them&mdash;but the thrill</p>
<p class="l">Of the maternal breast must ever move</p>
<p class="l">In blest communion with her child, and fill</p>
<p class="l">Even heaven itself with prayers and hymns of love!"</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XV&mdash;Family Prayer.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Hush! &#8217;tis a holy hour,&mdash;the quiet room</p>
<p class="l">Seems like a temple, while yon soft lamp sheds</p>
<p class="l">A faint and starry radiance through the room</p>
<p class="l">And the sweet stillness, down on yon bright heads</p>
<p class="l">With all their clustering locks, untouched by care,</p>
<p class="l">And bowed, as flowers are bowed with night,&mdash;in prayer.</p>
<p class="l">Gaze on, &#8217;tis lovely&mdash;childhood&#8217;s lip and cheek</p>
<p class="l">Mantling beneath its earnest brow of thought!"</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Home-sympathy will prompt to family devotion.
The latter is the fruit of the former. A
prayerless home is destitute of religious sympathy.
The family demands prayer. Its relation
to God, its dependence and specific duties, involve
devotion. Communion with God constitutes
a part of the intercourse and society of
home. The necessity of family prayer arises out
of the home-constitution and mission. Family
mercies and blessings; family dangers and weaknesses;
family hopes and temptations,&mdash;all bespeak

the importance of family worship. If you
occupy the responsible station of a parent; if
God has made you the head of a religious household,
and you profess to stand and live on the
Lord&#8217;s side, then, tell me, have you not by implication
vowed to maintain regular family worship?
Besides, the benefits and privilege of
prayer develop the obligation of the family to
engage in it. Is not every privilege a duty?
And if it is a duty for individuals and congregations
to pray, is it not, for a similar reason, the
duty of the family to establish her altar of devotion?
As a family we daily need and receive
mercies, daily sin, are tempted and in danger
every day; why not then as a family daily pray?</p>

<p class="dgp">But what is family prayer? It is not simply
individual prayer, not the altar of the closet;
but the home-altar, around which all the members
gather morning and evening, as a family-unit,
with one heart, one faith and one hope, to
commune with God and supplicate his mercy.
"In the devotion of this little assembly," says
Dr. Dwight, "parents pray for their children,
and children for their parents; the husband for
the wife, and the wife for the husband; while
brothers and sisters send up their requests to the
throne of Infinite Mercy, to call down blessings
on each other. Who that wears the name of a
man can be indifferent here? Must not the venerable
character of the parent, the peculiar tenderness
of the conjugal union, the affectionate
intimacy of the filial and fraternal relations;

must not the nearest of relations long existing,
the interchange of kindness long continued, and
the oneness of interests long cemented,&mdash;all
warm the heart, heighten the importance of
every petition, and increase the fervor of every
devotional effort?"</p>

<p class="dgp">What scene can be more lovely on earth, more
like the heavenly home, and more pleasing to
God, than that of a pious family kneeling with
one accord around the home-altar, and uniting
their supplications to their Father in heaven!
How sublime the act of those parents who thus
pray for the blessing of God upon their household!
How lovely the scene of a pious mother
gathering her little ones around her at the bedside,
and teaching them the privilege of prayer!
And what a safeguard is this home-devotion,
against all the machinations of Satan!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Our hearths are altars all;</p>
<p class="l">The prayers of hungry souls and poor,</p>
<p class="l">Like armed angels at the door,</p>
<p class="l">  Our unseen foes appal!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is this which makes home a type of heaven,
the dwelling place of God. The family altar is
heaven&#8217;s threshold. And happy are those children
who at that altar, have been consecrated
by a father&#8217;s blessing, baptized by a mother&#8217;s
tears, and borne up to heaven upon their joint
petitions, as a voluntary thank-offering to God.
The home that has honored God with an altar of
devotion may well be called blessed.</p>



<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Child, amidst the flowers at play,</p>
<p class="l">While the red light fades away;</p>
<p class="l">Mother, with thine earnest eye</p>
<p class="l">Ever following silently;</p>
<p class="l">Father, by the breeze of eve</p>
<p class="l">Called thy warmest work to leave;</p>
<p class="l">Pray!&mdash;ere yet the dark hours be,</p>
<p class="l">Lift the heart and bend the knee."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The duty thus to establish family prayer is
imperative. It is a duty because God commands
it, and the mission of home cannot be fulfilled
without it. It is a duty because a privilege and
a blessing, and the condition of parental efficiency
in all other duties;&mdash;because the moral and
spiritual growth of the child depends upon it.
It is one of the most effectual means of grace.
All the instructions, all the discipline and example,
of the parent will be in vain without it.
Hence both natural affection and Christian faith
should suggest its establishment. Parents are
bound to do so by their covenant vows, by the
obligations of baptism, by all the interests and
hopes of their household. They have dedicated
their children to God, and pledged themselves
to educate them for Him, and to train them up
in His ways. Tell me then, can you be faithful
to these vows and obligations without family
prayer? Can you fulfil your covenant engagements,
hope to receive your reward, and see your
children grow up in the nurture of the Lord&#8217;s
vineyard, without rearing up a family altar?</p>

<p class="dgp">The promised blessings of family prayer show

that every faithful Christian home must have its
family altar. These are unspeakable. It is a
sure defence against sin; it sanctifies the members,
and throws a hallowed atmosphere around
our household. The child will come under its
restraining and saving influence. A mother&#8217;s
prayer will haunt the child, and draw it as if by
magic power towards herself in heaven:</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"He might forget her melting prayer,</p>
<p class="l">While pleasure&#8217;s pulses madly fly,</p>
<p class="l">But in the still, unbroken air,</p>
<p class="l">Her gentle tones come stealing by,&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">And years of sin and manhood flee,</p>
<p class="l">And leave him at his mother&#8217;s knee!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It affords home security and happiness, removes
family friction, and causes all the complicated
wheels of the home-machinery to move
on noiselessly and smoothly. It promotes union
and harmony, expunges all selfishness, allays
petulant feelings and turbulent passions, destroys
peevishness of temper, and makes home-intercourse
holy and delightful. It causes the
members to reciprocate each other&#8217;s affections,
hushes the voice of recrimination, and exerts a
softening and harmonizing influence over each
heart. The dew of Hermon falls upon the home
where prayer is wont to be made. Its members
enjoy the good and the pleasantness of dwelling
together in unity. It gives tone and intensity
to their affections and sympathies: it throws a
sunshine around their hopes and interests: it

increases their happiness, and takes away the
poignancy of their grief and sorrow. It availeth
much, therefore, both for time and eternity.
Its voice has sent many a poor prodigal home to
his father&#8217;s house. Its answer has often been,
"This man was born there!" The child, kneeling
beside the pious mother, and pouring forth
its infant prayer to God, must attract the notice
of the heavenly host, and receive into its soul
the power of a new life.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Who would not be an infant now,</p>
<p class="l">To breathe an infant&#8217;s prayer?</p>
<p class="l">O manhood! could thy spirit kneel</p>
<p class="l">Beside that sunny child,</p>
<p class="l">As fondly pray, and purely feel,</p>
<p class="l">With soul as undefiled.</p>
<p class="l">That moment would encircle thee,</p>
<p class="l">With light and love divine;</p>
<p class="l">Thy gaze might dwell on Deity,</p>
<p class="l">And heaven itself be thine."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And yet the neglect of family prayer is a very
general defect of the Christian home. No home-duty
has indeed been more grossly neglected and
abused. Some attend to it only occasionally;
some only in times of affliction and distress, as
if then only they needed to pray to God; some
only on the Sabbath, as if that were the only day
to commune with Him. Some perform it only
in a formal way, having the form without the
spirit of prayer, as if God did not require the
fervent, in order to the effectual, prayer that
availeth much.</p>



<p class="dgp">As a general thing, at the present day, not
more than three or four families out of a whole
congregation, have established the family altar.
The parents may engage in closet prayer, but
their children are strangers to the fact. Their
devotions they seem zealous to conceal, as if
they were ashamed of their piety. Can this be
right? Is this the will of God? No! methinks
if the parent is faithful to the duty of private
prayer, he cannot omit the duty and privilege
of family devotion. But why neglect family
prayer? Are you ashamed of your children?
Have you no time? Then you are unworthy
of a family, and should not profess to act towards
them as the steward of God. Think you that
God will not answer and bless your prayers?
What more could you do and hope for your
children than to offer up supplications for them
to God?</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "What could a mother&#8217;s prayer,</p>
<p class="l">In all the wildest ecstacy of hope,</p>
<p class="l">Ask for her darling like the bliss of heaven?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Many seek by the most frivolous excuses, to
justify their neglect of family prayer. Some will
urge the press of other duties, alleging that other
engagements prevent it. This is false. God lays
upon you no engagement that is designed to supersede
the necessity of prayer. Besides, you
will find that you really waste more time than
it would require for family devotion. And further,
can you spend your time to better purpose

than in family prayer? I think not. It is the
best husbandry of time. Says Philip Henry to
his children, "Prayer and provender hinder no
man&#8217;s journey." But another pleads incapacity.
He has not the gift of speech, and cannot make
an eloquent prayer. This is no excuse. Prayer
is the gift of the Holy Spirit; and if you have
the spirit of prayer, you will find words for its
utterance. Besides, eloquence does not condition
the efficacy of prayer. Where there is
a willing mind, it is accepted according to that
a man hath, and not according to that he hath
not.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"When we of helps or hopes are quite bereaven,</p>
<p class="l">Our humble prayers have entrance into heaven."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We have the capacity to ask for what we earnestly
desire and feel the need of. The anger
of God will kindle against you for this excuse,
as it kindled against Moses for a similar one.
When He called him to be his messenger to Israel,
Moses said, as you do, "O my Lord, I am
not eloquent,&mdash;I am slow of speech, and of a
slow tongue. And the Lord said unto him, who
hath made man&#8217;s mouth? or, who maketh the
dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? Have
not I the Lord? The anger of the Lord was kindled
against him."</p>

<p class="dgp">Let me, therefore, urge upon you, Christian
parents, to make prayer a prominent element of
your home. You should be a priest unto your
family,&mdash;a leader in home-communion with God.

Your children have a right to expect this from
you. If you are a church member, how strange
and startling must be the enunciation in heaven,
that you are a prayerless Christian, and your home
destitute of the altar! And do you think that,
continuing thus, you will be admitted into that
heavenly home where there is one unbroken voice
of prayer and praise to God? Do you not tremble
at the prospect of those tremendous denunciations
which the Lord has uttered against those who neglect
and abuse the privilege of prayer? "Pour
out thy fury upon the families that have not called
upon thy name." Oh then, make your home a
house of prayer; lead your little flock in sweet
communion with God. Establish in them the
habit of devotion: Shape their consciences by
prayer. In this way you shall secure for yourself
and them the blessing of God: His smile shall
ever rest upon your household: Salvation shall
be the heritage of your children; they will grow
up in the divine life; and will live amid the blessing&#8217;s
of prayer, and be faithful to its requisitions:</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Hold the little hands in prayer, teach the weak knees their kneeling;</p>
<p class="l">Let him see thee speaking to thy God; he will not forget it afterwards;</p>
<p class="l">When old and gray will he feelingly remember a mother&#8217;s tender piety,</p>
<p class="l">And the touching recollection of her prayers shall arrest the strong man in his sin!"</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Section I&mdash;The Character Of Home Education.</h3>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Scratch the green rind of a sapling, or wantonly twist it in the soil,</p>
<p class="l">The scarred and crooked oak will tell of thee for centuries to come;</p>
<p class="l">Wherefore, though the voice of instruction waiteth for the ear of reason,</p>
<p class="l">Yet with his mother&#8217;s milk the young child drinketh education."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We come now to consider one of the most important
features of the Christian home, viz., as a
school for the education of character. This is
important because of its vital bearing upon the
interests of home. The parent is not only king
and priest, but prophet in the family. It is the
first school. We there receive a training for good
or for evil. There is not a word, nor an emotion,

nor an act, nor even a look there, which does not
teach the child something. Character is ever being
framed and moulded there. Every habit there
formed, and every action there performed, imply a
principle which shall enter as an element into the
future character of the child.</p>

<p class="dgp">What is home-education? It is the physical,
mental, moral, and religious development of the
child. To educate means to draw out as well as
to instil in. It means the evolution of our nature
as well as the communication of facts and principles
to us. The home training does not, therefore,
consist of simple information, but is a nurture
of body, mind and spirit. From this we may
infer the frequent mistakes of parents, in substituting
mere book-learning for a training up and
nurture, dealing with their children as if they had
no faculties, and making the entire education of
their children mechanical and empirical. Home
training involves the development of all their faculties
as a unit and in their living relation, causing
the body to move right, the mind to think
right, the heart to feel right, and the soul to love
right; changing your children from creatures of
mere impulse, prejudice and passion, to thinking,
loving and reasoning beings. To educate them is
to bring out their hidden powers, to form their
character, and prepare them for their station in
life. Thus home-education means a drawing out
and also a bringing up,&mdash;a training for man, and
a bringing up for God; a training and nurture
for the family, the state, and the church,&mdash;for

time and for eternity. These must be done together;
they involve but one process, and are
conditioned by each other. We cannot separate
a secular from a religious education, neither
can we separate a training from a bringing
up. While those faculties of the child which
exist in a state of mere involution, are being
developed, its nature must be supplied with appropriate
food; and every element of its education
must possess the plastic power of evolving
and giving specific form to its future character
and destiny. Thus the parent, in teaching, must
have a forming influence over the child; and his
instructions must correspond in character, kind
and extent, with the nature, wants, and destiny
of the child.</p>

<p class="dgp">What are now the different kinds or parts of
home-education?</p>

<p class="dgp">It must be physical. The child has a physical
nature, physical wants, and is related to the material
world; and should, therefore, receive a
physical education. The object of this is to ensure
that sound, vigorous frame of body which
is not only a great blessing in itself, but an essential
concomitant of a sound state and vigorous
development of mind. It refers to the proper
management of the health of the child, its diet,
habits of exercise and recreation. Parents should
teach their children the nature of the body, its
dangers, and bearing upon their future happiness.
They should teach them to govern their
appetite, and train them up to habits of exercise

and early rising. This part of home-education
begins in the nursery,&mdash;in the cradle, and is not
complete till the body is brought to maturity in
all its functions. Neglect of it will result in
physical imbecility, and often in mental derangement.
The object secured by it is, the preservation
of the health and constitution of the child.
In this we see its importance. What is your
wealth, your station, your influence, if through
your neglect of your children, they are deprived
of health, and grow up with the seeds of immature
death springing up in their system?</p>

<p class="dgp">In the physical training of children due regard
should be had to cleanliness, exercise, diet and
dress. Without this all will be vain. Many
parents keep them within doors, never let them
enjoy the pure air, nor exercise the muscular
system, keep their bodies cooped in clothing too
small, and feasted upon a diet unwholesome;
and as a consequence, they show a sickly growth,
and become unfit either for the burdens or for the
enjoyments of life.</p>

<p class="dgp">The importance of exercise in the open air,
and abstemiousness in diet, is proven from the
health of those nations that train their children
in all the exercise of riding, leaping, running and
fencing, and subject them from infancy to the
most frugal diet. Thus the perfect forms and
vigorous health of the Greeks, the Romans and
Persians were the fruit of national attention paid
to physical education. Every home should have
its suitable gymnasium. How many parents, by

their violation of the laws of health, prostitute
the strength of their children to profligacy and
indolence.</p>

<p class="dgp">Home-education must be intellectual. Much
of human character and happiness depends upon
the education of the mind, both as respects the
development of its faculties and the application
of legitimate truth. The mind is the man. It
is not, as Locke declares, like a blank sheet of
paper or a chest of drawers; but has an intuitional
as well as a logical consciousness, innate
ideas as well as capacities of receiving truth;
while all its faculties involve a unity, and exist
in the child in a state of involution; the abuse
and neglect of one of which will have their bearing
upon all the rest; and the mind without
proper culture in its undeveloped state in the
child, will show the symptoms of its abuse in
the man. The character of the mind in the man
will indicate the character of its education in the
child. This education should begin properly
with the first symptoms of consciousness. All
the powers of the intellect should be unfolded.
Parents should be the Principals in the mental
training of their children. The manner and
means of such training will be considered in
another place. Our purpose here is simply to
state this as a part of home-training. From the
important part which the mind acts in the great
drama of human life and destiny, we think that
no intelligent parent would presume to repudiate
its education.</p>



<p class="dgp">Home-education must be moral. The family
should develop the moral nature of the child.
The will should be educated; the sense of right
and wrong trained; the emotions cultivated; the
passions and desires ruled; the conscience and
faith developed. The necessity of this is seen
in the fact that our nature is fallen and perverted.
The means of educating the moral nature
of the child, are natural and revealed. Both are
of divine appointment. The former are those
which lie within the circumference of our abilities,
and will be of no avail without the latter,
which are found in the scriptures and church.
What are some of these means?</p>

<p class="dgp">1. Parents should place their children in circumstances
calculated to form a good moral character.
They should surround them with a moral
atmosphere, that they may, with their first breath,
inhale a pure moral being, and escape the contamination
of evil. This has been called "the
education of circumstances." Much of character
depends upon position and the circumstances in
which we are placed. This is seen in the difference
between those children who have enjoyed
the true christian home, and those who have not.
Hence the first thing parents should consider in
the moral training of their children is, the home
in which they are to be trained. This home
should afford them circumstances the most favorable
to their moral culture.</p>

<p class="dgp">2. They should remove all temptation. Evil
propensities are called forth by temptation; and

a child loses the power to resist in proportion to
the frequency of the temptation. Hence the exposure
of our children to temptation but educates
and strengthens their propensities to evil. On
the other hand, if we remove temptation, these
propensities will not be called into activity, and
will lose their tenacity. Never allow your children
to tamper with sin in any form; teach them
how to resist temptation; inspire them with an
abhorrence and a dread of all evil. In this way
you prepare them for the reception and reproduction
of moral truth.</p>

<p class="dgp">3. Another means of moral education is example.
This has been styled the "education of
example." This has more power than precept.
The efficiency of this means is based upon the
natural disposition of the child to imitate. Children
take their parents as the standard of all that
is good, and will, therefore, follow them in evil as
well as in good. Hence the parent&#8217;s example
should be a correct model of sound morality.
The child will be the moral counterpart of the
parent. You can see the parent&#8217;s home in the
child. He is the moral daguerreotype of his parent.
This but shows the importance of good example
in his moral training.</p>

<p class="dgp">4. But one of the most effectual means is, by
moral training, by which we mean, to draw out
and properly direct the moral faculties, and to
habituate them to the exercise of moral principle.
Without this, all mechanical education will
be fruitless. To call forth muscular power you

must exercise the muscles. So you give the child
moral stamina by developing its moral faculties,
and establishing in them the habit of moral action.
This training has its foundation in the law
of habit. It is given, with its results, in the Word
of God. "Train up a child," &amp;c. Also in the old
maxim, "Just as the twig is bent, the tree is inclined."</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Scratch the green rind of a sapling, or wantonly twist it in the soil,</p>
<p class="l">The scarred and crooked oak will tell of thee for centuries to come!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The power and pleasure of doing a thing depends
much upon habit. Our nature may become
habituated to good or evil; we become passive
in proportion to the habit. How important,
then, that the moral powers of our children be
trained up to principles and action until habits
of good thought, feeling, and conduct, are established.
Then they will not depart from them;
and their moral life will be spontaneous and a
source of enjoyment.</p>

<p class="dgp">The feelings, appetites and instincts of children
should be thus specially trained. According to
Dr. Gall, there are two classes of feelings,&mdash;the
selfish, yet necessary for the preservation of the
individual; and the unselfish, or those which are
directed to objects apart from self, yet liable to
abuse and misdirection. Both of these demand
a home-training. The parent should give to each
its true direction, restrain and harmonize them in

their relations and respective spheres of activity,
and bring them under law, and place before each
its legitimate object and end. Then, and then
only, do they become laws of self-preservation.
The natural appetites are subject to abuse, and
when unrestrained, defeat the very ends of their
existence. Thus the appetite for food may be
over-indulged through mistaken parental kindness,
until habits of sensualism are established,
and the child becomes a glutton, and finds the
grave of infamy.</p>

<p class="dgp">How many children have been thus destroyed
in soul and body by parental indulgence and neglect
of their natural feelings and appetites. The
feeling of cruelty, revenge, malice, falsehood, tale-bearing,
dishonesty, vanity, &amp;c., have, in the same
way and by the same indulgence, been engendered
in the children of Christian parents. The same,
too, may be said of the unselfish feelings. These
have been called the moral sentiments; and upon
their proper training depends the formation of a
positive moral character. The conscience comes
under this head. The parent should train that
important faculty of the child. It should be
taught to act from the standpoint of conscience,
and to form the habit of conscientiousness in
word and deed. This includes the training of
the motives also, and of all the cardinal moral
virtues, such as justice, honor, chastity, veneration,
kindness, &amp;c. "Teach your children," says
Goodrich in his Fireside Education, "never to
wound a person&#8217;s feelings because he is poor, because

he is deformed, because he is unfortunate,
because he holds an humble station in life, because
he is poorly clad, because he is weak in
body and mind, because he is awkward, or because
the God of nature has bestowed upon him
a darker skin than theirs."</p>

<p class="dgp">This early education should commence as soon
as the necessities of the child demand it. A child
should be taught what is necessary for it to know
and practice as soon as that necessity exists and
the child is capable of learning. Scripture sanctions
this. Our fathers did so. It was the injunction
of Moses to the children of Israel: Deut.
vi., 6-9. God commands you to break up the fallow
ground and sow the good seed at the first
dawn of the spring-life of your children, and then
to pray for the "early and the latter rain,"</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Teaching, with pious care, the dawning light</p>
<p class="l">Of infant intellect to know the Lord."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Home-education should be religious. As the
child has a religious nature, religious wants, and a
religious end to accomplish, it should receive from
its parents a religious training. Religion is educational.
We are commanded to teach religion
to our children. The admonition to "train up a
child in the way he should go," and to "bring him
up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord," is
a scripture sanction of religious education. Nature
and the bible are the text-books for such a
training. The child should be taught natural and
revealed religion. Such education involves the

development of the child&#8217;s religious nature, and
the diligent use of those means by which it may
become an adopted child of God.</p>

<p class="dgp">Education should be suited to the wants and
the destination of the child. Religion is its first
want,&mdash;the one thing needful, the chief concern;
and should, therefore, be the first object of attention
in home-training. The fear and love of God
should be the first lesson taught. This is the beginning
of wisdom. Teach your children to love
Him above father and mother, sister and brother.
The child is capable of such ideas of God. Children
can possess the sentiment of God; and when
this is instilled and developed as a rudiment of
their character, they have a preparation for the
grace of God. What is the mere secular, without
such a religious education? It is education
without its essence; for piety is the essence of all
education. Irreligious training is destructive,&mdash;a
curse rather than a blessing,&mdash;only a training up
to crime and to ruin. "The mildew of a cultivated,
but depraved mind, blights whatever it
falls upon." "Religion," says Dr. Barrow, "is
the only science, which is equally and indispensably
necessary to men of every rank, every age,
and every profession." "The end of learning,"
says Milton, "is to repair the ruins of our first
parents, by requiring to know God aright, and
out of that knowledge, to love Him, and to imitate
Him."</p>

<p class="dgp">We see, therefore, that religious training is the
only true palladium of your children&#8217;s happiness

and destiny; and should be the great end of all
home-teaching. Tinge all their thoughts and
feelings with a sense of eternity. Train them
up to build for another world. Stamp the impress
of a future life upon their tender hearts.
Beget in them longings after immortality. See
that their designs extend beyond this world. As
the Spartan mother gave character to her nation
by the instructions she gave her child, so you
give character to your religion, your church,
your home, by the spiritual culture of your offspring.
Let the jewels you give them be the
virtues and the gifts of the Holy Ghost,&mdash;the
ornaments of a meek and quiet spirit.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Take the germ, and make it</p>
<p class="l">  A bud of moral beauty. Let the dews</p>
<p class="l">Of knowledge and the light of virtue, wake it</p>
<p class="l">  In richest fragrance and in purest hues."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Childhood is the period in which the principles
of Christianity can be the most effectually engrafted
in our nature. Its pliability at that period insures
its free assimilation to the spirit and truth
of religion. "Would to God," says St. Pierre,
"I had preserved the sentiment of the existence
of the Supreme Being, and of His principal attributes,
as pure as I had it in my earliest years!"
It is the heart more than the head that religion
demands; and you can fill the young heart with
sentiments of God better than if you wait till it
grows hard as adamant in sin. You can elevate
the soul of your child to God, and teach it to

raise its little hands and voice in prayer to the
Most High. You can teach it this from the book
of nature and of revelation,&mdash;from the daisies that
spring up among the grass upon which it frolics,
by the mellow fruits after which it longs, by the
stars that shine in unclouded luster above it, and
by the breezes which ruffle its silken curls, and
bring perfume to its smiling face.</p>

<p class="dgp">To the mother especially, is committed the religious
education of the child at home. She is eminently
adapted, if herself a Christian, for such a
work. Her love, her piety, which breathes in
every word, in every look, makes her instructions
effectual and pleasing.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"&#8217;Tis pleasing to be schooled by female lips and eyes,</p>
<p class="l">They smile so when one&#8217;s right, and when one&#8217;s wrong,</p>
<p class="l">They smile still more; and then there</p>
<p class="l">Comes encouragement in the soft hand</p>
<p class="l">Over the brow, perhaps even a chaste kiss&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">I learned the little that I know by this."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">They can better reach and train the heart. Religion
is heart-wisdom. "My son, give me thy
heart!" We may use the head as an avenue to
the heart, yet nothing is done in the religion of
our children until the heart be carried. It is only
in that inner shrine that there can be deposited
the wisdom that is from above, and only then will
they be made wise unto salvation. And who is
better able to storm and carry that inner citadel,
and lead its subdued inmates to the Cross, than
the pious, tender-hearted, soliciting mother!</p>



<p class="dgp">Some parents object to the religious training of
their children, "because," say they, "there is danger
of having their minds biased by some particular
creed; they should be left, therefore, to themselves
till they are capable of making a choice,
and then let them choose their creed." This is
all a miserable subterfuge, and in direct opposition
to the explicit command of God and the
whole tenor of the gospel plan of salvation. It
goes upon the assumption that religion is but an
opinion&mdash;a subscription to a certain creed, learning
certain doctrines&mdash;a mere thing for the head.
Tell me, is it worse to bias their minds to a particular
creed, than to let them grow up biased to
the world, to the Devil and all his works? Is it
all of home, religious culture to bias them to a
particular creed? Besides, is it not the right, yea,
the duty of parents to bias their children in favor
of the religious creed of the parental home? It
shows, therefore, that those parents who, for this
reason, object to religious training, have but little
love for, and confidence in, their own creed, or
they would not shrink from biasing their children
to it.</p>

<p class="dgp">To encourage Christian parents to give their
children a good religious education, God has
given them numerous examples, from both sacred
and profane history, of conversion and eminent
piety in the age of childhood, as the direct
fruit of early parental instruction. Look, for instance,
at the child Samuel worshiping the Lord.
Look, too, at the case of Moses and of David, of

Joseph and of John the Baptist. Dr. Doddridge,
we are told, "was brought up in the early knowledge
of religion by his pious parents." His mother
"taught him the history of the Old and New
Testaments before he could read, by the assistance
of some Dutch tiles in the chimney of the room
where they commonly sat; and her wise and pious
reflections on the stories there represented were
the means of making some good impressions on
his heart, which never wore out." An eminently
pious minister thus writes to his parents, confirming
by his own blessed experience the early fruits
of religious training: "I verily believe that had
my religious training been confined to the gleanings
of the Sabbath school, instead of the steady
enforcement of the Mosaic arrangement at home
by my parents, I might now be pursuing a far different
course, and living for a far different end.
Many, very many times, as early in childhood as
I can recollect, has the Spirit of God convicted
me of sin, as my father at home has taught me
out of the scriptures, and I cannot easily forget
that the same high-priest of the home-church
once tore from me the hypocrite&#8217;s hope. And
that dear place had another to carry on the work;
gentler but not weaker; and memory recalls a
mother pressing her face close to mine as she
often knelt with me before the mercy-seat. I
will not cast reproach on any institution which
has been productive of good to myself and to
others, but with profound gratitude will say,
home was the place of my spiritual nativity,

and my parents were God&#8217;s instruments in leading
me to Christ!"</p>

<p class="dgp">The eminent piety of Dr. Dwight stands on
record as the fruit of a mother&#8217;s faithful religious
training; for "she taught him from the
very dawn of reason to fear God and keep His
commandments, and the impressions then made
upon his mind in infancy, were never effaced."
The mother of young Edwards is another example
of early piety as the fruit of religious home-culture.
The aged Polycarp, when under arrest
during the persecution under Marcus Aurelius, in
reply to the injunction of the pro-consul, "Swear,
curse Christ, and I release thee!" exclaimed, "Six
and eighty years have I served Him, and He has
done me nothing but good; and how could I curse
Him, my Lord and Saviour?" Thus showing himself
to have been a Christian at the early age of
four years! It was through the instructions of
his grandmother Lois, and his mother Eunice, that
young Timothy "knew from a child the holy scriptures,
which made him wise unto salvation."</p>

<p class="dgp">And what an effectual antidote are such instructions
against vice and temptation! How
many have by them been arrested from the devouring
jaws of infidelity and ruin! Thus it was
with John Randolph, who said that in the days
of the French revolution, when infidel reason
took the place of God and the bible, and infidelity
prowled unmolested throughout France,
he would have become an infidel himself, had
it not been for the remembrance of his childhood

days, when his pious mother taught him
to kneel by her side, and to say, "Our Father,
who art in heaven!" Thus, too, with the pious
and learned J.Q. Adams, who daily repeated the
little prayers his mother taught him when a child.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus, then, we see that parents are encouraged
by the most brilliant examples of history,
to teach their children religion at the home-fireside,
"when thou liest down and risest up."
Oh, let the gentle courtesies and sweet endearments
of home engrave the Word and Spirit
of God upon their tender hearts. Wait not
until they are matured in rebellion, and sin lay
beds of flinty rock over their hearts; but let
them breathe from infancy the atmosphere of
holiness, and drink from the living fountains of
divine truth. See that your homes become their
birth-place in the spiritual kingdom of Christ.</p>

<p class="dgp">Such religious training will be the guardian
of their future life, and will fortify them against
impending evil. What made Daniel steadfast
amidst all the efforts to heathenize him during
his captivity in Babylon? His early religious culture.
It was the means of his preservation. The
truth had been deeply engraven upon his heart
when young, and nothing could ever efface it.
His early home-impressions glowed there with
pristine freshness and power amid all the terrors
which surrounded him in the den and before the
throne of his implacable foe. These home instructions
may be silenced for a time, but never
destroyed. They may be overshadowed, but not

annihilated. Says Dr. Cumming, "The words
spoken by parents to their children in the privacy
of home are like words spoken in a whispering-gallery,
and will be clearly heard at the
distance of years, and along the corridors of ages
that are yet to come. They will prove like the
lone star to the mariner upon a dark and stormy
sea, associated with a mother&#8217;s love, with a father&#8217;s
example, with the roof-tree beneath which they
lived and loved, and will prove in after life to
mould the man and enable him to adorn and improve
the age in which he is placed."</p>

<p class="dgp">Be faithful, therefore, in the spiritual culture of
your children. Give them "line upon line and
precept upon precept, here a little and there a
little." Lead them on by degrees to Christ until
each indelible impression becomes an established
habit. In the morning of their life sow the seed;
and God will give the increase; and then in the
day of judgment your children will rise up and
call you blessed!</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Section II&mdash;Neglect And Abuse Of Home-Education.</h3>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Accomplishments have taken virtue&#8217;s place,</p>
<p class="l">And wisdom falls before exterior grace;</p>
<p class="l">We slight the precious kernel of the stone,</p>
<p class="l">And toil to polish its rough coat alone.</p>
<p class="l">A just deportment, manners graced with ease,</p>
<p class="l">Elegant phases, and figure formed to please,</p>
<p class="l">Are qualities that seem to comprehend</p>
<p class="l">Whatever parents, guardians, schools intend;</p>
<p class="l">Hence all that interferes, and dares to clash</p>
<p class="l">With indolence and luxury, is trash!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Home-education in all its parts is most sadly
neglected and abused at the present day. Many
parents think that the office of teacher is not
included in the parental character and mission.
The neglect of home-training seems to arise out
of an existing-prejudice against it. Some think
that education will unfit their children for industry,&mdash;will
make them indolent and proud. They
regard mental culture as an enemy to both industry
and virtue. Strange delusion! The mind is
given to use, not to abuse; and its abuse is no
argument against its proper use. God has given
the mind, and intends it to be developed and cultivated.
If, therefore, its training has made it indolent
and dissipated, it only proves its education

to be spurious. You might, by a parity of reasoning,
blindfold the eye that it might not he covetous,
or tie up the hand lest it pick a man&#8217;s pocket,
or hobble the feet lest they run into evil ways,
as to keep the mind in ignorance lest it become
wicked.</p>

<p class="dgp">Besides, we find more real indolence and wickedness
among the ignorant than among the educated;
for man will be educated in something.
If you do not educate your child in the truths of
nature and religion, be assured he will become
trained in falsehood and in the ways of Satan.
"Uneducated mind is uneducated vice." A proper
education is a divine alchemy which turns all
the baser parts of man&#8217;s nature into gold. Without
it all is discord and darkness within and without.
Besides, ignorance leads to misery because
it leads to wickedness. Dr. Johnson was once
asked, "Who is the most miserable man?" He
replied, "That man who cannot read on a rainy
day!" It has well been said by Edmund Burke
that "Education is the cheap defense of nations."
Why? Because it prevents vice, poverty, misery,
and relieves the state of the support of paupers
and criminals. "A good education," says Miss
Sedgwick, "is a young man&#8217;s best capital." Says
Governor Everett to parents, "Sow the seed of
instruction in your son&#8217;s and daughter&#8217;s minds.
It will flourish when that over-arching heaven
shall pass away like a scroll, and the eternal
sun which lightens it, shall set in blood." Says
the Rev. Robert Hall, "I am persuaded that

the extreme profligacy, improvidence, and misery,
which are so prevalent among the laboring
classes in many countries, are chiefly to be ascribed
to the want of education."</p>

<p class="dgp">What indeed can we look for but wretchedness
and guilt from that child that has been left
by its cruel parents to grow up "darkening in the
deeper ignorance of mankind, with all its jealousies,
and its narrow-mindedness, and its superstitions,
and its penury of enjoyments, poor amid
the intellectual and moral riches of the universe;
blind in this splendid temple which God has lighted
up, and famishing amid the profusions of Omnipotence?"
And, parents, let me ask you, if
you thus neglect the proper education of your
children, and as a consequence, such pauperism
of estate, of mind, and of morals, come upon
them, will you not have to answer for all this
to God?</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Oh, woe for those who trample on the mind,</p>
<p class="l">That fearful thing! They know not what they do,</p>
<p class="l">Nor what they deal with!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Your children, thus neglected, will become victims
to inordinate passion, without power to
discern between reality and illusion, ignorant
of what is true happiness, living for mere sense,
with their moral nature enclosed in the iron
mail of superstition, while the good seeds of
truth sown upon their hearts "wither away, because
they have no depth of earth."</p>

<p class="dgp">Parents cannot, therefore, neglect the education

of their children without incurring disgrace
and guilt before God and man. They will meet
a merited retribution both here and hereafter.
The justice of this is forcibly illustrated in a law
of the Icelanders, which makes the court inquire,
when a child is accursed, whether the parents have
given the offender a good education? And if not,
the court inflicts the punishment on the parents.
This but expresses the higher law of God which
holds parents responsible for the training of their
children. Listen to the threatening voice of God
in history. Crates, an ancient philosopher, used
to say that if he could reach the highest eminence
in the city, he would make this proclamation:
"What mean ye, fellow-citizens, to be so anxious
after wealth, but so indifferent to your children&#8217;s
education? It is like being solicitous about the
shoe, but neglecting entirely the foot that is to
wear it!"</p>

<p class="dgp">We would reiterate that proclamation in this
age of superior intelligence. To the pious parent
there is a pleasure in training the young and tender
heart for God. What a beautiful tribute did
Thompson yield to this pleasure in the following
lines:</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Delightful task! to rear the tender thought,</p>
<p class="l">To teach the young idea how to shoot,</p>
<p class="l">To pour the fresh instruction o&#8217;er the mind,</p>
<p class="l">To breathe enlivening spirit, and to fix</p>
<p class="l">The generous purpose in the glowing breast!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But home-education, at the present day, is as

much abused as it is neglected. The criminality
of the former is perhaps greater than that of the
latter. This may have more reference to the female
than to the male portion of the family.
The abuse here consists of the want of a training
up to wisdom. We see this in what is called the
fashionable, instead of the Christian, education,
received at some of our fashionable boarding
schools. Here the child is sent with no home-training
whatever, to be trained up a fashionable
doll, fit to be played with and dandled upon the
arms of a whining and heartless society, with no
preparation for companionship in life, destitute
of substantial character, with undoctrinated feelings
of aversion to religion, fit only for a puppet
show in some gay and thoughtless circle; kneeling
before fashion as her God, and giving her
hand in marriage only to a golden and a gilded
calf.</p>

<p class="dgp">According to this abuse of home-education, "a
young maiden is kept in the nursery and the
school room, like a ship on the stocks, while she
is furbished with abundance of showy accomplishments,
and is launched like the ship, looking
taut and trim, but empty of everything
that can make her useful." Thus one great
abuse of home-education is to substitute the
boarding school for home-culture,&mdash;to send our
children to such school at an age when they
should he trained by and live under the direct
influence of the parent. This generally ends
in initiated profligacy, and alienation from home,

while at best but a dunce after his course of training
is ended.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Would you your son should be a sot and a dunce,</p>
<p class="l">Lascivious, headstrong, or all these at once?</p>
<p class="l">Train him in public with a mob of boys,</p>
<p class="l">Childish in mischief only and in noise."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Too often is it the case that the artifices and
refinements of our fashionable boarding-schools,
have a most withering influence upon body, mind
and soul, enfeebling and distorting the body, producing
depraved stomachs, whimsical nerves, peevish
tempers, indolent minds, and depraved morals.
They become but wrecks of what they were
when they first entered the school. This has
been called "the stiff and starched system of
muslin education," and is the nursery of pale,
sickly, listless, peevish children.</p>

<p class="dgp">But this is not the only abuse of home-education.
Even when the training is begun at home,
the very idea of education is often abused, because
inefficient, destitute of true moral elements,
and partial both as to the mode and as to the substance
of it. The true resources of life are not
developed; there is no instruction given in the
principles and conditions of temporal and eternal
well-being; there is no discipline of the mind,
or body or morals. But the great idea and aim
of education with many parents now, is to teach
the child to read and write and cipher as a means
of making money and getting along in this world,&mdash;not,
of course, to prevent them from cheating

others, but others from cheating them. All is
prostituted to money and business. Character
and happiness are left out of view. What have
our schools now to do with the propensities, appetites,
temperaments, habits and character of
the pupils? And how are the parents who send
their children to school to have them trained up
with reference to these! All that is now looked
at, is that learning which will fit the child for
business. As a consequence most of our schools
are a disgrace to the very name of education.
More evil actually results from them than good.
The mind and heart are injured,&mdash;the one but
half trained; the other corrupted. Mental and
moral training are divorced; hence one-sided,
and the very end of education defeated. The
child has no incentive to a virtuous and a noble
life, and sinks down to the groveling drudgery
of money-making. It is educated for nature, but
not for God,&mdash;for this, but not for the next life.</p>

<p class="dgp">If we would not abuse home-education we must
not separate the moral from the mental,&mdash;the secular
from the religious; for in doing so, we expose
the child to rationalism and infidelity on the
one hand, and to superstition and spiritualism on
the other. This course is generally taken by parents
when they educate their children for mere
worldly utility and fashion, when they have not
the welfare of the soul in view, and look only to
the advantage of the body.</p>

<p class="dgp">The duty then of Christian parents to give
their children a true home-education may be seen

from the consequences of its neglect and abuse on
the one hand, and from its value and importance
on the other. They should furnish them with all
the necessary means, opportunities, and directions,
of a Christian education. Give them proper
books. "Without books," says the quaint
Bartholin, "God is silent, justice dormant, science
at a stand, philosophy lame, letters dumb,
and all things involved in Cimmerian darkness."
Bring them up to the habit of properly reading
and studying these books. "A reading people
will soon become a thinking people, and a thinking
people must soon become a great people."
Every book you furnish your child, and which it
reads with reflection is "like a cast of the weaver&#8217;s
shuttle, adding another thread to the indestructible
web of existence." It will be worth
more to him than all your hoarded gold and silver.
Make diligent use of those great auxiliaries
to home-education, which the church has instituted,
such as Sabbath schools, bible classes and
catechisation.</p>

<p class="dgp">Home-education does not imply a system of
parental training isolated from the educational
ministrations of the church; but is churchly in
its spirit and in all its parts, and should in all
respects be connected with the church. Home
training is a duty you owe to the church. By
virtue of your relation to her, she has the authority
to demand of you such a training of your
child; and by virtue of your relation to the
child, he has a right to such an education, and

can demand it from you. It stands on the basis
of parental duty imposed on you by God Himself.
It is a prime necessity. It is your children&#8217;s
birthright, which they themselves cannot
sell with impunity, for the pottage of gold or silver
or pleasure: neither can you neglect or abuse
it without guilt before God.</p>

<p class="dgp">It is, therefore, a duty which you cannot shake
off, and which involves both for you and for your
child, the most momentous consequences. Christian
parents! be faithful to this duty. Magnify
your office as a teacher; be faithful to your
household as a school. Diligently serve your
children as the pupils that God has put under
your care. Educate them for Him. Teach them
to "walk by faith, not by sight." Cultivate in
them a sense of the unseen world,&mdash;the feeling
of the actual influence of the Spirit of God, the
guardianship of his holy angels, and of the communion
of saints. Teach them how to live and
how to die; and by the force of your own holy
example allure them to the cross, and lead them
onward and upward in the living way of eternal
life. You are encouraged to do so by the assurance
of God that "when they grow old they will
not depart from it."</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XVII&mdash;Family Habits.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Dost thou live, man, dost thou live, or only breathe and labor?</p>
<p class="l">Art thou free, or enslaved to a routine, the daily machinery of habit?</p>
<p class="l">For one man is quickened into life, where thousands exist as in a torpor,</p>
<p class="l">Feeding, toiling, sleeping, an insensate weary round;</p>
<p class="l">The plough, or the ledger, or the trade, with animal cares and indolence,</p>
<p class="l">Make the mass of vital years a heavy lump unleavened."</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Much of the character, usefulness and happiness
of home depend upon home habits. No one
is without habits, good or bad. They have much
to do with our welfare here and hereafter. Hence
the importance of establishing proper habits.</p>

<p class="dgp">Habit is a state of any thing, implying some
continuance or permanence. It may be formed
by nature or induced by extraneous circumstances.
It is a settled disposition of the mind or body, involving
an aptitude for the performance of certain

actions, acquired by custom or frequent repetition.
There are habits of the body, of the mind,
of action; physical, mental, moral and religious
habits. All these are included in the term home-habits.</p>

<p class="dgp">Habit has been considered an "ultimate fact,"
that is, one of those qualities of life which are
found to exist, and beyond which no investigation
can be made. Habit may be referred to the
law of action which pervades all vital being. Nature
demands the repetition of vital action, and
habit arises from this demand and from the manner
in which it is supplied. It is the fruit of
the operation of the law of repetition of action
in all life. Hence it is, that habit becomes a
part of our very existence, and that the well-being
and happiness of our existence depend so
much upon it.</p>

<p class="dgp">The facility of action depends upon habit. In
proportion as the actions of life become a habit,
they will be easily performed, and performed with
pleasure. The capacity to establish habits is the
consequence of the power given us to promote
our own welfare. This capacity is designed to
bind us to that course of action which will accomplish
the purposes of our existence. If rightly
used, it is the guardian of our happiness; but if
misused it will be our certain ruin. It will delight
and fascinate until it subjugate our will, and
lead us on, as in the case of the drunkard and the
gambler, to infamy and to hell.</p>

<p class="dgp">Home-habits are easily formed and established.

Some kind, either good or bad, are being established
every day. They are often secretly and unconsciously
formed. All the principles and rules
of conduct there introduced become at once the
nuclei of future habits. Those increase in power
and supremacy as they are formed. We see
this in the use of tobacco and intoxicating drink.
These are, at first, disagreeable, and the victim
has the power of repelling and overcoming them;
but soon the habit is formed, when their use becomes
pleasant, and he is made a willing slave to
them.</p>

<p class="dgp">The same may he said of the habits of industry,
of study, of frugality, yea, of all the moral
and religious acts of the Christian. It is easy to
form such habits in children. Evil habits are
more easily established, because we are naturally
inclined to all evil; and when once formed, no
parental interposition can break them up. Hence
the importance of an early training up to good.
If parents but leave their children to their own
ways, they will run into evil habits; for sin is an
epidemic. Profanity and falsehood and all other
outrages against God will soon become the controlling
habits of their lives. But when taken
early, parents have complete power over their
offspring. It is, therefore, a gross abuse of the
Christian home when parents become indifferent
to the formation of habits. It is their duty to
crush every evil habit in its incipient state.</p>

<p class="dgp">The forming of a good habit may not at first be
congenial with our feelings. It may be irksome.

But if we persevere in it, that which at first was
painful and difficult will soon be a source of enjoyment.
Thus the habit of family prayer may at
first be repulsive even to the Christian parent; a
feeling of delicacy and the sense of unworthiness
may, at the family altar, repress the feelings of enjoyment
experienced in the closet; but soon the
habit of this devotion will be formed, when it
will be enjoyed as an essential part of home. To
abandon it would be like breaking up the tenderest
ties which bind the members together. The
same may be said of the omission of a duty.
How easily can the Christian form the habit of
omitting family prayer or any other duty! Every
such omission but forms and increases the habit,
until it gains an ascendancy over our sense of
duty, and at last exhibits its sovereign power in
our total abandonment of the duty. Each omission
has the power of reproducing itself in other
and more frequent omissions. In this way Christian
homes insensibly become unfaithful to their
high vocation, and degenerate finally into complete
apathy and estrangement from God. That
indulgence which the misguided sympathy of too
many parents prompts to, and which does away
with all parental restraint, is the cause of children
coming under the curse of evil habits. In this
way parents often contribute to the temporal and
eternal ruin of their offspring. This indulgence
is no evidence of tender love, but of parental infatuation.
It shows a blind and unholy love,&mdash;a
love which owns no law, which is governed by no

sense of duty, and which excludes all discipline;
and hence unlike the love of God, who "chastiseth
every one whom He loveth and receiveth."</p>

<p class="dgp">The force and influence of home-habits will
teach us the importance of establishing such only
as receive the sanction of God. Habits, as we
have seen, are much more easily formed than
broken. When once established they enslave us
to them, and subject our character to their iron
despotism. They become the channel through
which our life flows. The stream of our existence
first forms the channel, and then the channel
rules, guides and controls the current of the
stream. The deeper the channel is wrought, the
greater is its moulding and controlling influence
over the stream. Thus our habits become our
masters, and are the irrevocable rulers of our life.
This is true of good, as well as of bad habits. We
come into voluntary subjection to them, until we
shrink from the first proposal to depart from them.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Habit," says the Rev. C.C. Colton, "will reconcile
us to everything but change, and even to
change, if it recur not too quickly. Milton, therefore,
makes his hell an ice-house, as well as an
oven, and freezes his devils at one period, but
bakes them at another. The late Sir George
Staunton informed, me, that he had visited a
man in India, who had committed a murder,
and in order not only to save his life, but what
was of much more consequence, his caste, he submitted
to the penalty imposed; this was, that he
should sleep for seven years on a bedstead, without

any mattress, the whole surface of which was
studded with points of iron resembling nails, but
not so sharp as to penetrate the flesh. Sir George
saw him in the fifth year of his probation, and his
skin then was like the hide of a rhinoceros, but
more callous. At that time, however, he could
sleep comfortably on his bed of thorns, and remarked
that at the expiration of the term of his
sentence, he should most probably continue that
system from choice, which he had been obliged to
adopt from necessity."</p>

<p class="dgp">This illustrates the force of established habit,
and the pliability of our nature in yielding a voluntary
subjection to it. What is at first involuntary,
painful, and a self-denial to us, wall when it
passes into a habit, become agreeable, because the
habit bends our nature to it, chains us down to it,
infatuates the will, and thus becomes, as it were,
a second nature. If so, it is very plain that our
habits are either a blessing or a curse. When
good they are a safeguard against evil, give stability
to our character, and are the law of perseverance
in well-doing. Such habits in the Christian
home form, an irresistible bulwark against the
intrusions of temptation and iniquity. But when
they are bad, they chain us to evil, and impel us
onward and downward to ruin. Hence from his
habits we can easily estimate the merit or demerit
of a person, know all his weak points and idiosyncrasies,
and what will be the probable termination
of his existence.</p>

<p class="dgp">The same may be said of the habits of a family.

They enter into its very constitution, rule
and direct all its activities and interests. They
cling to each member with more than magic power,
and become interwoven with his very being;
and by them we may easily ascertain the moral
and spiritual strength of that family; we can tell
whether the parents are faithful to their mission,
and whether its members will be likely to pass
over from the home of their childhood to the
church of Christ. Who has not felt this power
of habit? Who has not wept over some habits
which haunt him like an evil spirit; and rejoiced
over others as a safeguard from sin and a propellor
to good? Is it not, therefore, a matter of momentous
interest to the Christian home, that it
establish habits of the right kind and quality?</p>

<p class="dgp">It should never be forgotten by Christian parents,
and they cannot be too careful to impress it
upon their children, that habit engenders habit,&mdash;has
the power of reproducing itself, and begetting
habits of its own kind, increasing according to
the laws of growth, as it is thus reproduced. A
habit in one member of a family may produce a
like habit in all the other members. The habits
of the husband may be engendered in the wife,
and those of the parents, in their children. If
so, then are we not responsible for our habits?
And shall any other kind save Christian habits,
be found in the Christian home? These we cannot
give in detail. It is plain that those habits
only are Christian, which receive the sanction of
God&#8217;s Word and Spirit, and find a response in

the Christian faith and conscience. Here, for instance,
is a habit being formed,&mdash;habit of thought:
is it pure? Here is a habit of conversation: is it
holy? Here is a habit of action: is it godly?
And if not, it does not belong to the Christian
home.</p>

<p class="dgp">See, then, ye members of the Christian home,
to the habits you are forming. Form the habit
of "doing all thing&#8217;s decently and in order." Let
the work and duties of each day be done according
to method. This is essential to success in your
pursuits and aims. Without this, your Christian
life may be blustering and stormy, but you will
accomplish little, and will be as unstable as water.
One duty will interfere with another. You may
have family prayer and instruction to-day, but
something will prevent it to-morrow. Establish
the habit of Christian industry. Be diligent; not
slothful in business. Industry must be the price
of all you obtain. You must be instant in season.
The Christian home cannot be an indolent,
idle home. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,
do it with all thy might. Press forward.</p>

<p class="dgp">It is said of Rutherford that "such was his unwearied
assiduity and diligence, that he seemed
to pray constantly, to preach constantly, to catechise
constantly, and to visit the sick, exhorting
from house to house, to teach as much in the
schools, and spend as much time with the students
in fitting them for the ministry, as if he
had been sequestered from all the world, and yet
withal, to write as much as if he had been constantly

shut up in his study." Such should be
the industry of each Christian home. Without
it, temptation will beset the members. "A busy
man is troubled with but one devil, but the idle
man with a thousand."</p>

<p class="dgp">Establish the habit also of perseverance in well-doing.
"Be steadfast, immovable, always abounding
in the work of the Lord." "Be not weary
in well-doing." Let the strata of your home be
made up of the immovable Rock. He only that
continueth unto the end shall be saved. Having
done all, stand! Let your motto be, <em>Perseverando
vinces</em>. Form the habit of contentment with
your home and condition in life. "Godliness
with contentment is great gain." If your home
is humble, and not adorned with the embellishments
and luxuries of life, yet it may be holy, and
hence, happy. Avoid all castle-building. Do not
fancy a better home, and fall out with the one
you enjoy. Never permit the flimsy creations of
a distorted imagination to gain an ascendancy
over your reason and faith. Live above all sentimentalism
and day-dreaming; and in all the feelings
and conduct of your household, submit to the
guidance of a superintending Providence, walking
by faith and not by sight, assured that your present
home is but probationary and preparatory to
a better home in heaven.</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XVIII&mdash;Home-Government.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Alas! for a thousand fathers, whose indulgent sloth</p>
<p class="l">Hath emptied the vial of confusion over a thousand homes.</p>
<p class="l">Alas! for the palaces and hovels, that might have been nurseries for heaven,</p>
<p class="l">By hot intestine broils blighted into schools for hell;</p>
<p class="l">None knoweth his place, yet all refuse to serve,</p>
<p class="l">None weareth the crown, yet all usurp the scepter;</p>
<p class="l">The mother, heart-stricken years agone, hath dropped into an early grave;</p>
<p class="l">The silent sisters long to leave a home they cannot love;</p>
<p class="l">The brothers, casting off restraint, follow their wayward wills."</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Home is a little commonwealth jointly governed
by the parents. It involves law. The
mutual relation of parent and child implies authority
on the one hand, and obedience on the
other. This is the principle of all government.
Home is the first form of society. As such it
must have a government. Its institution implies
the prerogatives of the parent and the subordination

of the child. Without this there would be
no order, no harmony, no training for the state or
the church; for&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Society is a chain of obligations, and its links support each other;</p>
<p class="l">The branch cannot but wither that is cut from the parent vine."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The relation of the parent to the child is that of
a superior to an inferior. The right of the parent
is to command; the duty of the child is to
obey. Hence it is the relation of authority to
subordination. This relation includes the principles
of home-government. The parent is not the
author of his authority. It is delegated to him.
Neither can he make arbitrary laws for home;
these must be the laws of God. It is as much
the duty of the parent to rule as it is for the
child to be ruled.</p>

<p class="dgp">The principle of home-government is love,&mdash;love
ruling and obeying according to law. These
are exercised, as it were, by the instinct of natural
affection as taken up and refined by the Christian
life and faith. This government implies reciprocity
of right,&mdash;the right of the parent to govern
and the right of the child to be governed. It
is similar in its fundamentals to the government of
the state and church. It involves the legislative,
judicial and executive functions; its elements are
law, authority, obedience, and penalties. The basis
of its laws is the Word of God. We may consider
the whole subject under two general heads,
viz., parental authority, and filial obedience.</p>



<p class="dgp">1. Parental authority is threefold, legislative,
judicial and executive. The two latter we shall
more fully consider under the head of home-discipline.
The legislative authority of the parent
is confined to the development of God&#8217;s laws for
the Christian home. He cannot enact arbitrary
laws. His authority is founded on his relation
to his children as the author of their being; "yet
it does not admit," says Schlegel, "of being set
forth and comprised in any exact and positive
formularies." It does not, as in the old Roman
law, concede to the parent the power over the life
of the child. This would not only violate the law
of natural affection, but would be an amalgamation
of the family and state. Neither is the parental
authority merely conventional, given to the
parent by the state as a policy. It is no civil or
political investiture, making the parent a delegated
civil ruler; but comes from God as an in
alienable right, and independent, as such, of the
state. It does not, therefore, rest upon civil legislation,
but has its foundation in human nature and
the revealed law of God; neither can the state
legislate upon it, except in cases where its exercise
becomes an infringement upon the prerogatives
of the state itself.</p>

<p class="dgp">Parents are magistrates under God, and, as His
stewards, cannot abdicate their authority, nor delegate
it to another. Neither can they be tyrants
in the exercise of it. God has given to them the
principles of home-legislation, the standard of judicial
authority, and the rules of their executive

power. God gives the law. The parent is only
deputy governor,&mdash;steward, "bound to be faithful."
Hence the obligation of the child to obey
the steward is as great as that to obey the Master.
"Where the principal is silent, take heed that
thou despise not the deputy."</p>

<p class="dgp">Here, then, we have the extent of the parent&#8217;s
authority, and the spirit and manner in which it
should be exercised. His power is grafted on the
strength of another, and should not extend beyond
it. Its exercise should not run into despotism on
the one hand, nor into indifferentism on the other.
According to the vagaries of some religious sentimentalists
and fanatics, it is supposed that religion
supersedes the necessity of parental government.
They think that such authority runs
counter to the spirit and requisitions of the gospel.
But this is asserted in the broad face of
God&#8217;s Word. The promptings of such sentimentalism
are to permit children to do as they
please, and to bring them up under the influence
of domestic libertinism. Honor thy father and
thy mother, is a command which explodes such
a gaudy theory; and he who does not obey it, brutalizes
human nature, dishonors God, subverts the
principles of constitutional society, throws off allegiance
to the prerogatives of a divinely constituted
superior, and overthrows both church and
state. Hence the severe penalties attached, in the
Mosaic law, to disobedience of parental authority.
"He that curseth his father or mother, shall surely
be put to death." "The eye that mocketh at his

father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens
of the valley shall pick it out, and the young
eagles shall eat it." And hence also that affectionate
obedience which Joseph yielded to his
aged father, and that profound veneration with
which he kneeled before him to receive his dying
blessing.</p>

<p class="dgp">2. Filial obedience is the correlative of parental
authority. If parents have authority, children
must yield obedience to it. This is not
only necessary to home-government, but also to
the proper formation of the character of the child.
It must be trained up under law and authority to
prepare it for citizenship in the state. This must
be the obedience of confidence and love. It does
not imply the subordination of the slave.</p>

<p class="dgp">As the father&#8217;s authority is not that of the despot,
so the obedience of the child is not that of
the servile, trembling subject. It is not unnatural,&mdash;no
infringement upon the rights and liberties
of the child. His subordination to the parent
is the law of his liberty. He is not free without
it. The home in which filial obedience is not
yielded to parental authority is "a marvel of permitted
chaos," and will soon become desolate, a
scene of anarchy and strife. The members live
in a state of lawlessness, destitute of reciprocated
affection,&mdash;the parent unhonored, the father and
mother despised and cursed, and the child untrained,
uncared for, lawless, and unfit for the
state or the church.</p>

<p class="dgp">If, therefore, God has constituted governmental

relations in the Christian home, and invested the
parent with authority over his children, who will
deny the coördinate obligations of the child to
yield reverence, submission and gratitude to the
parent? "Children, obey your parents in all
thing&#8217;s; for this is well pleasing unto the Lord."</p>

<p class="dgp">This is called the first commandment with
promise. It is one of promise both to the parent
and the child. Children are bound to obey
their parents in all things, that is, in all things
lawful and in accordance with the revealed will
of God. The child is not bound to obey the parent&#8217;s
command to sin,&mdash;to lie, steal, or neglect the
means of grace; because these are express violations
of God&#8217;s law; and in such instances the
authority of God supersedes that of the parent.
Obey God rather than man.</p>

<p class="dgp">But, on the other hand, the obligation of the
child is, to obey the parent in all things lawful
and Christian. Where this is not done the Christian
home becomes a curse. What an evil is a
refractory child! How often does the parental eye
weep in bitterness over such a child! How often
have such children brought their parents down
in sorrow to the grave! Let them think of this.
Let parents think of this before it is too late.
Let them think of the fearful criminality which
is attached to parental indulgence and filial disobedience.</p>

<p class="dgp">We may neglect and abuse the home-government
in two ways, either by over-indulgence, or
by the iron rod of tyranny. When we make it

lax in its restraints and requisitions, it becomes
merely nominal, and its laws are never enforced
and obeyed. Often parents voluntarily relinquish
their right and duty to rule their household; and
as a consequence, their children abandon the duty
of obedience, and grow up in a lawless state; or if
they do command, they never execute their commands,
but leave all to the discretion of their children.
They violate their laws with impunity, until
all influence over them is lost, and the child
becomes master of the parent. The self-will of
the former takes the place of the authority of the
latter, until at last the home-government becomes
a complete farce and mockery. Such parents are
always making laws and giving commands; but
never enforce them; they complain that they cannot
get their children to obey them; and this cannot
is but the utterance and exponent of their unfaithfulness
and disgrace.</p>

<p class="dgp">The opposite abuse of home-government is
parental despotism,&mdash;ruling with a rod of iron,
making slaves of children, acting the unfeeling
and heartless tyrant over them, assuming towards
them attitudes of hard task-masters, and making
them obey from motives of trembling, fear and
dread.</p>

<p class="dgp">There is no christianity in all this. It engenders
in them the spirit of a slave; it roots out all
confidence and love; their obedience becomes involuntary
and mechanical. They shrink in silent
dread from the presence of their parents, and long
for the time when they can escape their galling

yoke. The parental rod destroys the filial love
and confidence. Hence the obedience of the latter
is servile; and home loses its tender affections
and sympathies, and becomes to them a workhouse,
a confinement; its restrictions are a yoke;
its interests are repulsive, and all its natural affinities
give way to complete alienation. The children
of such homes, when grown up, are the most
lawless and reckless, ready at once to pass over
from extreme servitude to libertinism.</p>

<p class="dgp">The government of the Christian home lies in a
medium between these two extremes. It is mild,
yet decisive, firm; not lawless, yet not despotic;
but combines in proper order and harmony, the
true elements of parental authority and filial subordination.
Love and fear harmonize; the child
fears because he loves; and is prompted to obedience
by both. "But give thy son his way, he
will hate thee and scorn thee together."</p>

<p class="dgp">Christian parents! be faithful to the government
of your household. Like Abraham, command
your household. Without this, your children
will be your curse and the curse of the state.
Wherever they go they will become the standard-bearer
of the turbulent, and brandish the torch of
discord, until at last, perhaps, they will die in a
dungeon or upon the gibbet. And then the curse
will recoil upon you. It will strike deep into your
hearts. It will come to you in the darkness of unfulfilled
promises and blighted hopes and injured
affections and desolated homes and wounded spirits
and disgraced names and infamous memories!

And you, in the face of these, will go down with
bleeding sorrow to the grave, and up to the bar of
God with the blood of your children&#8217;s destruction
upon your skirts, its voice crying unto you from
the grave of infamy and from the world of eternal
retribution. You will then see the folly and the
fruits of your diseased affection and misguided indulgence,&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XIX&mdash;Home-Discipline.</h2>


<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "In ancient days,</p>
<p class="l">There dwelt a sage called Discipline,</p>
<p class="l">His eye was meek, and a smile</p>
<p class="l">Played on his lips, and in his speech was heard</p>
<p class="l">Paternal sweetness, dignity, and love.</p>
<p class="l">The occupation dearest to his heart</p>
<p class="l">Was to encourage goodness.</p>
<p class="l">If e&#8217;er it chanced, as sometimes chance it must,</p>
<p class="l">That one, among so many, overleaped</p>
<p class="l">The limits of control, his gentle eye</p>
<p class="l">Grew stern, and darted a severe rebuke,</p>
<p class="l">His frown was full of terror, and his voice</p>
<p class="l">Shook the delinquent with such fits of awe</p>
<p class="l">As left him not, till penitence had won</p>
<p class="l">Lost favor back again, and closed the breach."</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Discipline involves the judicial and executive
functions of the home-government. It is
the method of regulating and executing the principles
and practice of government. It includes
the rein and the rod, the treatment of offences

against the laws of home, the execution of the
parental authority by the imposition of proper
restraints upon the child. It involves a reciprocity
of duty,&mdash;the duty of the parent to correct,
and the duty of the child to submit. God has
given this discipline; He has invested the parent
with power to execute it, and imposed upon the
child the obligation to live submissively under it.</p>

<p class="dgp">All must admit the necessity of home-discipline.
"It must needs be that offense come." There is
a corresponding needs be in the proper treatment
of these offenses when they do come. Law implies
penalties; and the proper character and execution
of these are as essential to the true object
and end of government as is the law itself. The
former would he powerless without the latter.
Through the agency of home-discipline the proper
fear and love of the child are developed in due
proportion and brought into proper relations to
each other, making the fear filial and the love
reverential. There is, therefore, the same call for
discipline in the family as there is in the state and
the church. It is the condition of true harmony
between, the parent and child. "The child that is
used to constraint, feareth not more than he loveth;
but give thy son his way, he will hate thee and
scorn thee together."</p>

<p class="dgp">It is necessary because God commands it; and
He commands it because it is indispensable to the
security and well-being of the child, and, we might
add, of the state and the church. "Withhold not
correction from the child; for if thou beatest him

with the rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat
him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from
hell. He that spareth his rod hateth his son; but
he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes."
Children are by nature depraved, and if left to
themselves, will choose evil rather than good;
hence, as foolishness is bound up in the heart of
a child, the rod of correction must be used to
drive them from it. He must be restrained, corrected,
educated under law. In the language of
Cowper&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Plants raised with tenderness are seldom strong;</p>
<p class="l">Man&#8217;s coltish disposition asks the thong;</p>
<p class="l">And without discipline, the favorite child,</p>
<p class="l">Like a neglected forester, runs wild."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There are two false systems of home-discipline,
viz., the despotism of discipline, or discipline from
the standpoint of law without love; and the libertinism
of discipline, or discipline from the standpoint
of love without law.</p>

<p class="dgp">Home-discipline from the standpoint of law
without love, involves the principle of parental
despotism. It is extreme legal severity, and consists
in the treatment of children as if they were
brutes, using no other mode of correction than
that of direct corporeal punishment. This but
hardens them, and begets a roughness of nature
and spirit like the discipline under which they are
brought up. Many parents seek to justify such
mechanical severity by the saying of Solomon,
"he that spareth the rod spoileth the child." But

their interpretation of this does not show the wisdom
of the wise man. They suppose the term
rod, must mean the iron rod of the unfeeling and
unloving despot. Not so; God has a rod for all
His children; but it is the rod of a compassionate
Father, and does not always inflict corporeal punishment.
It is exercised because He loves them,
not because He delights in revenge and in their
misery. He uses it, not to have them obey Him
from fear of punishment, not to force them into a
slavish service, and to cause them to shrink with
trembling awe from His presence; but to correct
their faults by drawing them to Him in fond embrace,
in grateful penitence and hopeful reformation,
under the deep conviction that every stroke
of His rod was the work of love, forcing from
them a kiss for His rod, and a blessing for His
hand, the utterance of a sanction for His deed,
"It was good for me that I was afflicted!"</p>

<p class="dgp">This rod is very different, however, from that
of the despot beneath whom the child crouches
with trembling dread, and under the influence of
whom he becomes, like the down-trodden subject,
servile, brutish and rebellious. You will reap
bitter fruits from such a discipline, which is but
the exponent of the letter of the law without its
spirit, and which has nothing for the child but the
scowl and the frown and the cruel lash. You
might as well seek to "gather grapes from thorns,
or figs from thistles," as to reap from it a true reformation
and religious training. Your child will
be trained to hate the law, to despise authority,

and to regard his obedience as a compromise of
true liberty. He will, therefore, seek liberty only
in the usurpation of law and government. He
will contemn love, because where it should have
been disinterested, and shown in its greatest tenderness
and purity,&mdash;in the parent&#8217;s heart, it was
abused and silenced.</p>

<p class="dgp">That discipline, therefore, which is ever magnifying
trifles, finding fault, scolding and storming,
and threatening and whipping, and falling upon
the child, like the continual dropping of rain in a
winter day, casts a withering gloom over home,
makes it repulsive to the child, gives to the parent
a forbidding aspect, until the children become
provoked to wrath, and regard their home as a
prison, their life as a slavery, and long for the time
when they may leave home and parents forever.
Such discipline makes the reign of the parent a
reign of terror. It reminds one of the laws of
Draco, written in blood. It produces in the child
a broken spirit, a reckless desperation, a hardened
contumacy, a deep and sullen melancholy, a mental
and moral hardihood which prepares him for
deeds of outrage upon law and humanity. It is
unnatural, revolting to human nature, to beat and
crush, as if with an iron rod, the tender child of our
hearts and hopes. It extinguishes natural affection;
and no subsequent kindness can rekindle the
flame. The child becomes forever alienated, and
bears the curse of its maltreatment upon its character
and destiny. "Ye parents, provoke not your
children to anger, lest they should be discouraged."</p>



<p class="dgp">The following quaint anecdote is a good commentary
upon such discipline: A blacksmith
brought up his son, to whom he was very severe,
to his own trade. The urchin was, nevertheless,
an audacious dog. One day the old vulcan was
attempting to harden a cold chisel which he had
made of foreign steel, but could not succeed;
"horsewhip it, father," exclaimed the youth, "if
that will not harden it, nothing will!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Nothing justifies such cruel discipline. It results
in depravity of life. The most notorious
criminals began their career under the lash of parental
cruelty. If rods and stripes and cries and
tears and cruel beating are the first lessons of life
we are to learn, then we shall be educated in as
well as by these. The Europeans surpass all other
nations in cruelty to their offspring. The Arab
is tender to his children, and rules them by kindness
and caresses. He restrains them by the corrections
of wisely exerted love. Cruelty does not
become the Christian home. It is revolting to
see a parent stand with a rod over his child, to
make him read the bible or say his prayers. You
cannot whip religion into a child. This is opposite
to humanity and religion.</p>

<p class="dgp">Home-discipline from the standpoint of love
without law, is the second false system which we
have mentioned, and involves the principle of parental
libertinism. It does not consist so much
in the want as in the neglect and abuse of discipline.
The restraints may be sufficient, and the
threats abundant, but they are never executed.

When the children disobey, the parents may
flounder and storm, loud and long, but all ends in
words, in a storm of passion or whining complaint,
and the child is thus encouraged to repeat
the misconduct, feeling that his parents have no
respect for their word. Such a home becomes
scolding, but not an orderly home.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Discipline at length,</p>
<p class="l">O&#8217;erlooked and unemployed, grow sick and died,</p>
<p class="l">Then study languished, emulation slept,</p>
<p class="l">And virtue fled. What was learned,</p>
<p class="l">If aught was learned in childhood, is forgot;</p>
<p class="l">And such expense as pinches parents blue,</p>
<p class="l">And mortifies the liberal hand of love,</p>
<p class="l">Is squandered in pursuit of idle sports</p>
<p class="l">And vicious pleasures."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Parents, through their misguided sympathy,
often connive at filial disobedience. Their kindness
is most unkind. Their parental love issues
forth as a mere burst of feeling, unguided by
either reason or law. Hence, their sentimental
hearts become an asylum for filial delinquency and
criminality. This is no proof of love, but the opposite;
for "he that spareth the rod hateth his
son; but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes."
Love will thus prompt the parent to
chasten his son while there is hope. Eli was an
example of extreme parental indulgence. "His
sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them
not." It was the defect also of David&#8217;s discipline,
and the fruit of this defect caused him to cry out

in bitter anguish, "Oh Absalom, my son, my son,
would to God I had died for thee!"</p>

<p class="dgp">That parent who cannot restrain his children,
does not bear rule in his house, and as a consequence,
cannot bless his household. That parental
tenderness which withholds the proper restraints
of discipline from an erring child, is most
cruel and ruinous. It is winking at his wayward
temper, his licentious passions and growing habits
of vice. And these, in their terrible maturity,
will recoil upon the deluded parent, "biting like
a serpent and stinging like an adder." Nothing
is more ruinous to a child and disastrous to the
hopes and happiness of home, than such relaxation
of discipline. "A child left to himself bringeth
his mother to shame." How many mothers have
bitterly experienced this, and wept bitter tears
over the memory of their degraded and wretched
offspring! It is ruinous to the parent. He will
both curse and despise thee. Your unlawful indulgence,
therefore, is infanticide. Your cruel
embraces are hugging your child to death. The
sentiment of love should never crush the reason
and violate the laws of love. Do you permit your
sick to die rather than to inflict the pain of giving
them the medicine to cure? This would be madness.
And yet you do a similar deed when you
indulge your child in wickedness. He will grow
up lawless, headstrong, rebellious; and these may
lead him on to poverty, infamy, crime and perdition,
ending thus in total shipwreck of character
and soul. You thus make for society bad members,

drunkards, blackguards, paupers, criminals;
and furnish fuel for the eternal burnings. And
will not the curse rest upon you?</p>

<p class="dgp">It is wonderful to what an extent this extreme
indulgence prevails at the present day. Many
parents seem insensible even to the necessity of
any discipline, and think it is an infringement upon
the liberties of the child. Mistaken parents!
Such views are opposed to the laws of God and
man. By them you sow for yourselves and children
the seeds of a future retribution.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus we see that there are two dangerous extremes
or false systems of home-discipline, viz.,
the exercise of parental fondness and sympathy
without parental authority, on the one hand, and
the exercise of parental authority without proper
sympathy, on the other. Misguided sympathy and
fondness will produce filial libertinism; and despotic
authority will beget filial servility.</p>

<p class="dgp">True Christian home-discipline lies in a medium
between these. It involves the union of true parental
sympathy and authority, of proper love and
proper law; for affection, when not united to authority
and law, degenerates into sentimental
fondness; and authority and law, when, not tempered
with love, degenerate into brutal tyranny,
and produce inward servility and outward bondage.
The parents who are, in discipline, prompted
by the first, may be loved, but will not be respected.
Those who are ruled by the second, may be
dreaded, but will not be loved. The first does
violence to law, and ends in the insubordination

of the child and the imbecility of the parent.
The second does violence to love, makes duty a
task, correction a corporeal punishment, the child
a slave, the parent a despot, and ends consequently
in the destruction of natural affection. Hence,
in home-discipline, true severity and true sympathy
should unite and temper each other. Without
this the very ends proposed will be frustrated.</p>

<p class="dgp">True home-discipline repudiates the legal idea
of punishment as much as of impunity. It lies in
a medium between these, and involves the idea of
Christian correction or chastisement. We should
correct, but not punish our children. Correction
is not the mere execution of legal penalties as
such, but the fruit of Christian love and concern
for the child. It does not mean simple corporeal
chastisement, but moral restraints. The impunity
is the fruit of love without law; the corporeal
punishment is the execution of law without love;
Christian correction is the interposition of love
acting according to law in restraining the child.
Hence, true discipline is the correction of the child
by the love of the parent, according to the laws
of home-government.</p>

<p class="dgp">Abraham instituted in his household a model
system of home-discipline. "I know him," says
God, "that he will command his children and his
household after him, and they shall keep the ways
of the Lord to do justice and judgment." He
was not a tyrant; his comrades did not bear the
rough sternness of a despot, neither did his power
wear the scowl of vengeance. But these bore

the firmness and decision of love tempered and
directed by the law of Christian duty and responsibility.
They showed his station as a father;
they wore the exponent of his authority as a parent,
whose love was a safeguard against tyranny
on the one hand, and whose accountability to God
was a security against anarchy, on the other.
Hence, his children respected his station, venerated
his name, appreciated his love, confided in
his sympathy, and yielded a voluntary obedience
to his commands; for they discerned in them the
blessing; and when offenses came, they bent in
the spirit of loving submission and pupilage, under
his rod of correction, and kissed it as the
means of their reformation and culture.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus does home-discipline involve the firmness
of parental authority united with the mildness of
parental love. Love should hold the reins and
use the rod. Then it will purify and elevate natural
affection, and develop in the child a sense of
proper fear, without either disrespectful familiarity
or mechanical servitude.</p>

<p class="dgp">The efficiency of home-discipline depends upon
its early introduction, upon the decision with
which it is administered, upon its adaptation to
the real wants of the child, and upon the manner
in which it is applied.</p>

<p class="dgp">It should be commenced in due season, as soon
as the child can understand its meaning and object.
The child should be made to understand
that he lives under authority and restraint. This
will prepare him for a profitable correction when

necessary. The great fault of many parents is
that they begin too late to correct their children,
and leave them until then in ignorance of its nature
and intent. Hence, the child will not appreciate
the parent&#8217;s motive, and will lack that pliability
of spirit which is essential to reformation.
"The sceptre," says James, in his Family Monitor,
"should be seen by him before the rod; and an
early, judicious and steady exhibition of the former,
would render the latter almost unnecessary.
He must be made to submit, and that while
young, and then submission will become a habit;
the reins must be felt by him early, and he will
thus learn to obey them."</p>

<p class="dgp">Home-discipline should be steady, uniform, consistent
and reasonable. Both parents and children
should be guided by the dictates of reason and
religion. It should not be administered by the
caprice of passion, nor received in the spirit of
insubordination. It should be prompted by a parent&#8217;s
heart, and inflicted by a parent&#8217;s hand.
Convince the recreant child that you correct him
from motives of love, and for his own good. Let
reason and love be at the bottom of every chastisement;
let them hold the reins and guide the
rod; and when the latter is used, let it be from
necessity. Lay no injunction upon your child
without the ensurance of a compliance.</p>

<p class="dgp">Your discipline should never involve impossibilities
or uncertainties; neither should you permit
your child to sport with your injunctions.
Every command should produce either obedience

or correction. You should be firm in the infliction
of a threatened chastisement, and faithful in
the fulfilment of a promise to reward. Many parents
are always scolding, threatening and promising,
but never execute and fulfil. As a consequence
they run from one extreme of discipline
to another.</p>

<p class="dgp">In home-discipline, parents should act harmoniously
and coöperate with each other. They should
be of one mind and of one heart, and equally bear
the burden. The one should not oppose the discipline
which the other is administering. This
destroys its effect, and leaves the child in a state
of indecision, leading to prejudice against one or
the other of the parents. It too often happens
that parents thus take opposite sides,&mdash;the father
too severe perhaps, and the mother too indulgent.
Thus divided, their house must fall. Nothing is
more ruinous to the child than for the mother to
counteract by soothing opiates, the admonitions
of the father. Children soon see this, and will as
soon hate their father. When one parent thus
holds the reins without the rod, and the other
uses the rod without the reins, the very ends of
discipline are frustrated. Sometimes the child is
given over to the mother exclusively till a certain
age, when the father begins to act without the
mother. This is wrong. A child is never too
young to be ruled by the father, and never too
old to come under the softening influence of the
mother.</p>

<p class="dgp">Discipline should be administered with impartiality.

Never make one child a favorite. Favoritism
and consequent indulgence, will produce
prejudice against the other children. It will introduce
dissension among them. This is unworthy
the Christian parent and his home. The history
of Jacob and Joseph, as regards both the subject
and the victim of parental favoritism, is a warning
against such partiality. It produces, pride, envy,
jealousy, family broils and strife, in which even
the parents take a part, and by which the husband
is often set against his wife, parents against children,
and children against each other.</p>

<p class="dgp">Correction is an essential element of true discipline.
"The rod and the reproof give wisdom."
There are two things in correction,&mdash;the reins and
the whip, or the command and the chastisement.
The one should not take the place of the other.
The scepter must not be converted into a whip.
If the reins are properly held and used, the whip
need scarcely ever be required. If the child is
timely and properly trained, commanded and
chided, he will not require much chastisement,&mdash;perhaps
no corporeal punishment. It is better
to prevent crimes than to punish them; for prevention
is more than cure.</p>

<p class="dgp">Hence the first thing in discipline is timely and
wholesome command. Guide and train your child
properly, and you need seldom resort to coercion.
Training and leading are better than forcing. By
the former you establish a habit of systematic obedience
which will soon become a pleasure to the
child. By the latter you jade and vex and burden

him. But when the reins will not do alone, then
the whip must be resorted to. And the question
at once arises, what kind of a whip? We answer,
not such as you use to your horses and oxen in the
team,&mdash;not the horse-whip. Corporeal punishment
should be used only as a last resort, when
all other corrections have failed, when the child
becomes an outlaw, and his reprobate heart can be
reached only through the infliction of bodily pain.
As a general thing it is even then unavailing, because
too mechanical to produce permanent good,
and not adapted to mental and moral reformation.</p>

<p class="dgp">Sometimes, however, there is necessity in the
use of this rod. "Every child," says Dr. South,
"has some brute in it, and some man in it, and
just in proportion to the brute we must whip it."
When thus necessary we should not shrink from
this kind of correction. "It is pusillanimity, as
well as folly, to shrink from the crushing of the
egg, but to wait composedly for the hatching of
the viper." Yet, on the other hand, in the language
of Dr. Bell, "a maximum of attainment
can be made only by a minimum of punishment."</p>

<p class="dgp">In the discipline of home, whether by guidance
or by forcing, whether by the rein or the
rod, much depends upon the manner in which it
is administered. It should always be adapted to
the peculiar character and offense of the child.
You can restrain some children better by kind
words and promises than by rough admonitions
and threats. Study, therefore, the peculiarities
of your child, and prudently apportion the correction

to the offense. If there are sincere penitence
and confession, the correction should be
purely moral. Let the object of every correction
be to produce penitence and reformation of
heart as well as of conduct, and a hatred of the
offense. Always execute your threats and fulfill
your promises at the time and on the occasion
designated. Threaten as little as possible, and be
not hasty in your threats. Treat your children as
rational and moral beings:</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Be obeyed when thou commandest, but command not often;</p>
<p class="l">Spare not, if thy word hath passed for punishment;</p>
<p class="l">Let not thy child see thee humbled, nor learn to think thee false."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Always examine the offense before you punish.
See whether it is of ignorance or not,&mdash;whether
of the head or the heart,&mdash;whether intentional or
accidental. Examine his motives in committing
the offense. If you find he merits correction, before
you inflict it, lay before him the nature and
enormity of the offense, wherein he disobeyed, the
guilt of that disobedience, its consequences, and
your duty to correct him for it.</p>

<p class="dgp">Never correct in a state of anger. Some correct
only when they are in a violent passion.
This is ruling from passion, not from principle.
It is like administering medicine scalding hot,
which rather burns than cures. Be judicious and
kind in all your discipline; otherwise you may
engender in your child the very propensities and
improprieties of action you desire to eradicate.

A mild rebuke in the season of calmness, is better
than a rod in the heat of passion. Let your
children know and see that all your discipline is
for their own good,&mdash;to arrest them from danger
and ruin, and to train them up in the way God
would have them go. Let your words and deeds
show this in the form of parental kindness and
sympathy and solicitude. This will do more than
the angry look, the stormy threat, and the cruel
lash.</p>

<p class="dgp">The power and influence of the home-example
are incalculable. Example is teaching by action.
By it the child inherits the spirit and character of
the parent. Such is its influence that you can estimate
the parent by the child. Show me a child,
polite, courteous, refined, moral and honorable in
all his sentiments and conduct; and I will point
you to a well-conducted nursery, to noble and
high-minded parents, faithful to their offspring.
Theirs is a holy and a happy home; and the blessing
of God rests upon it. But on the other hand,
in the wayward, dissolute child I discern unfaithful
parents who have no respect for religion, and
who take no interest in the spiritual welfare of
their children. Thus the child is a living commentary
upon its home and its parents. The
fruits of the latter will be seen in the character
of the former. The child is the moral reproduction
of the parent. Hence the pious parent is
rewarded in his child, and the immoral parent is
cursed in his child. Whatsoever thou sowest in
thy child, that shalt thou also reap.</p>

<p class="dgp" style="text-align: center"><img src="images/image4.png" alt="Sunshine of Youth."><br />Sunshine of Youth.</p>

<p class="dgp">The precepts of home are unavailing unless enforced
by a corresponding example. Nothing is
so forcible and encouraging as the "Follow me."
It proves sincerity and earnestness; and is adapted
to the imitative capacity and disposition of the
child. It is all-commanding and resistless. Says
Solomon, "Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth
the countenance of his friend." Says Paul
"It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine,
nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or

is offended, or is made weak." Says Shakspeare,
"One drunkard loves another of the name." Says
Dr. Young&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Ambition fires ambition; love of gain</p>
<p class="l">Strikes like a pestilence from breast to breast;</p>
<p class="l">Riot, pride, perfidy, blue vapor&#8217;s breath;</p>
<p class="l">And inhumanity is caught from man,</p>
<p class="l">From smiling man."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If such is the influence of example, we must admit
the necessity of a true Christian example in
the family. It is necessary because it is the condition
of the efficacy of home-precepts. "During
the minority of reason, imitation is the regent of
the soul, and they who are least swayed by argument
are most governed by example." We learn
from example before we can speak. Hence if
we would have our children walk in the way of
God&#8217;s commandments, we must go before them;
we must take the lead; we must exemplify in our
action what we incorporate in our oral instructions;
our light must shine not only upon, but before
them; they must see our good works as well
as hear our good precepts. Said a man once to
J.A. James, "I owe everything under God, to the
eminent and consistent piety of my father. So
thoroughly consistent was he, that I could find
nothing in the smallest degree at variance with
his character as a professor of religion. This
kept its hold upon me." It was the means of
his conversion to God.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus children readily discern any discrepancy

between a parent&#8217;s teaching and example. If we
are professors of religion, and they see us worldly-minded,
grasping after riches, pleasures and honors;
the dupes of ungodly fashion, manifesting a
malicious spirit, indolent, prayerless, and indifferent
to their spiritual welfare, what do they infer
but that we are hypocrites, and will our precepts
then do them any good? No. "Line upon line
and precept upon precept" will be given to no
purpose. Hence the necessity of enforcing our
precepts by Christian deportment. Speak in an
angry tone before your child; and what will it
avail for you to admonish him against anger?
Many parents express surprise that all they can
say to their children does no good; they remain
stubborn, self-willed and recreant.</p>

<p class="dgp">But if these parents will look at what they have
done as well as said, they will perhaps be less surprised.
They may find a solution of the problem
in their own capricious disposition, turbulent passions
and ungodly walk. The child will soon discard
a parent&#8217;s precepts when they are not enforced
by a parent&#8217;s example. Hence that parent
who ruins his own soul can do but little for the
soul of his child. The blasphemer and sabbath-breaker
is unfit to correct his child, for swearing
and sabbath-breaking. He alone who doeth the
truth can teach his children truth. He only who
has good habits can teach his children good habits.
"Who loves," says William Jay, "to take his meat
from a leprous hand?" A drunkard will make a
poor preacher of sobriety. A proud, passionate

father is a wretched recommender of humility and
meekness to his children. What those who are
under his care, see, will more than counteract
what they hear; and all his efforts will be rejected
with the question, "Thou that teachest another,
teachest thou not thyself?" Hence parents
should say to their children, "Be ye followers of
me, even as I also am of Christ." Their example
should include all their precepts. In this way
they both hear and see religion in its living, moving
and breathing form before them. They should
thus go in and out before them, leading them step
by step to heaven.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"As a bird each fond endearment tries</p>
<p class="l">To tempt her new-fledged offspring to the skies,</p>
<p class="l">They tried each art, reproved each dull delay,</p>
<p class="l">Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is also necessary because of its adaptation to
the capacities and imitative disposition of children.
They judge by the organs of sense, and
by their perceptions of truth through externals.
Naked abstract truth does not sufficiently interest
them. They are pleased with history, narrative,
illustration, more than with philosophy.
They are awake to the first and receive from
them a lasting impression; while the impression
made by the second is dreamy and ephemeral.
They will never forget your example because
it is adapted to their taste and capacity.
Long after they have forgotten your precepts
upon the duty and privilege of prayer, will they

remember your prayers; and long after the influence
of the former has faded, will that of the
latter rule and allure them to God. Hence the
necessity of a Christian home-example. "If any
have children or nephews, let them learn first
to show piety at home."</p>

<p class="dgp">If such, then, are its influence and necessity,
we can easily infer the duty of parents to
show their children a Christian example. If
they form their character upon the approved
model of their parents, then the duty to give
them a Christian model is very obvious. They
will rather follow your ungodly example than
obey your godly precepts. "To give children,"
says Archbishop Tillotson, "good instruction and
a bad example, is but beckoning to them with
the head to show them the way to heaven&mdash;while
you take them by the hand to lead them in the
way to hell."</p>

<p class="dgp">This duty is, therefore, enforced by the most
powerful motives. The influence and benefit
of a pious example; the promised rewards attending
it; the deep curse that attends its absence;
the misery which a bad example entails
upon all the members of the Christian household;
and especially the fruits of both a good
and bad example, in eternity,&mdash;all these considerations
should prompt you to the faithful performance
of this duty. If the members of your
household may he ruined here by a bad example,
what will be its consequences in the eternal
world?</p>



<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "If men of good lives,</p>
<p class="l">Who, by their virtuous actions, stir up others</p>
<p class="l">To noble and religious imitation,</p>
<p class="l">Receive the greater glory after death</p>
<p class="l">As sin must needs confess; what may they feel</p>
<p class="l">In height of torment, and in weight of vengeance,</p>
<p class="l">Not only they themselves not doing well,</p>
<p class="l">But set a light up to show men to hell?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We see a similar inducement to this duty in the
blessings and rewards of a pious example. Its
blessings are unspeakable both here and hereafter.
The temporal and eternal welfare of your home,
the hope of meeting your children in heaven, and
receiving there the promised reward of your stewardship,
depend upon this duty. That family is
happy as wall as holy, where the parents rear up
their children under the fostering influence of a
Christian example.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Behold his little ones around him! they bask in the sunshine of smile;</p>
<p class="l">And infant innocence and joy lighten these happy faces;</p>
<p class="l">He is holy, and they honor him; he is loving; and they love him;</p>
<p class="l">He is consistent, and they esteem him; he is firm, and they fear him.</p>
<p class="l">His house is the palace of peace; for the Prince of peace is there.</p>
<p class="l">Even so, from the bustle of life, he goeth to his well-ordered home."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A serious obstacle to the efficacy of a good example
is, the too frequent want of agreement in

the example of the parents. That of the father
often conflicts with and neutralizes that of the
mother. They are not one in their example.
This the children soon see, and disregard the
good rather than the bad example. "How can
two walk together except they he agreed?" The
child cannot follow the pious father in the way of
life, when the ungodly mother secretly and openly
draws him back. Operated upon by two opposite
influences, he will move between them.</p>

<p class="dgp">We are here taught the imprudence, and we
might add, sin, of pious persons forming a matrimonial
alliance with wicked and ungodly persons.
In the choice of a companion for life, we should
consider an agreement in religious as well as in
social character. How many unhappy matches
and homes and children and parents have been
made by disobedience to the divine precept, "Be
ye not unequally yoked with unbelievers?" Isaac
and Rebecca showed their appreciation of this precept
in the care they took to procure a pious wife
for Jacob. "I am weary of my life," says Rebecca,
"because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob
take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as
these, what good shall my life do me?" This
should be the solicitude of every Christian parent.
Parents should possess unanimity of spirit
and practice in making up and giving the home-example.
They should walk unitedly, like Zacharias
and Elizabeth, in all the ordinances and statutes
of the Lord blameless.</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XXI&mdash;The Choice Of Pursuits.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"For what then was I born? to fill the circling year</p>
<p class="l">With daily toil for daily bread, with sordid pains and pleasures?</p>
<p class="l">To walk this chequered world, alternate light and darkness,</p>

<p class="l">To decorate the gallery of art? to clear a few acres of forest?</p>
<p class="l">For more than these, my soul, thy God hath lent thee life!"</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">The choice of positions and pursuits in life is
one important and responsible mission of home.
Children look up to their parents to aid them in
this. They are to have them prepared for a useful
citizenship in the state. Life demands that
each of us, in obedience to the law of self-preservation
and of our relations to human society, prepare
for some useful occupation, not only for a
livelihood, but also for the benefit of the state.
The duty and the interest of the parent are to
bring up the child to such a pursuit as is best
adapted to his circumstances and abilities. Our

character, success and happiness in life, depend
upon our obedience to this law of adaptation.</p>

<p class="dgp">As such pursuits are chosen and prepared for,
while under the guardian care of our parents, it
is evident they should take an active part both in
the choice and the preparation. They are responsible
for these as far as their influence extends.
It is their duty to afford their children aid in
choosing and preparing for a useful and appropriate
occupation, to fit them for the circumstances
in which the Providence of God may place them,
and to educate them for an efficient citizenship in
the state.</p>

<p class="dgp">This is but developing the principle of self-preservation
in the child, and fitting him for a
proper adherence to it in after life. The home
prepares the individual for his legitimate position
in the state as well as in the church; and this implies
not only his education in the principles and
practice of virtue and religion, but also in some
useful and appropriate pursuit, by which he may
meet the wants and prepare for the exigencies of
life. To rear up your children therefore, in idleness
and ignorance of any useful occupation, is
not only doing great injustice to the child, but
also to human society, subjecting her to expenditure
and corruption in the support and influence
of paupers and criminals. Every child should
learn some trade or profession in order to self-subsistence
and to the prosperity and well-being
of the state.</p>

<p class="dgp">Hence it is a breach of moral obligation for parents,

whether rich or poor, to permit their children
to grow up in idleness and vagrancy. If
they do so, and as a consequence, drag out an impoverished
and miserable existence, struggling
between the importunities of want and those precarious
contingencies upon which its satisfaction is
suspended; and in the hour of despair and urgent
necessity, they resort to crime in order to meet
their wants, or to dissipation in order to avert
their wretchedness for a time, is it not plain that
their parents are responsible to God for all their
crime and misery?</p>

<p class="dgp">Nothing will, therefore, justify them in their
omission of this duty. No amount of inherited
wealth; no dependence upon wealthy relatives;
no honorable station in society, will excuse them
from training up their children to some useful
employment by which, if circumstances demand,
they may secure a subsistence. And even if their
legacy render it unnecessary to be followed in order
to subsistence, it is a duty which is due to the
state. No man can with impunity live in the
state without some employment. This would be
an infringement upon her rights and an abuse of
her privileges. The individual, with all his wealth
and talents, belongs to the state, and should, therefore,
make such an appropriation of these as will
be most conducive to its welfare.</p>

<p class="dgp">And besides, we know not what disastrous
changes may take place in life. The parental
legacy may soon be squandered by the child, and
he be left without funds or friends; the emergencies

of the future may increase beyond all anticipation;
sickness and manifold adversities may
soon sweep away all his inheritance. And then
what will become of your child if he is ignorant of
any pursuit in which to engage for a subsistence?
Besides, it is a matter of very common observation,
that those who receive a large legacy and
have been brought up in idleness, become prodigal
in their expenditure, and squander their fortune
by dissipation more rapidly than their parents
amassed it by industry and frugality; and then,
ignorant and helpless and profligate, they eke out
a wretched existence in abject poverty, resorting
to illegitimate means for a living, until the last
fruits of their improper training may be seen in
the state&#8217;s prison or upon the gibbet.</p>

<p class="dgp">History will afford ample illustration of this.
From it we may easily infer the duty of parental
interposition. The Athenians expressed their
sense of this duty in the enactment of a law that,
if parents did not qualify their children for securing
a livelihood by having them learn some occupation,
the child was not bound to make provision
for the parent when old and necessitous.</p>

<p class="dgp">In the selection of an occupation for his children,
the parent should consult their taste and
talents and circumstances, and choose for them a
pursuit adapted to these. If his child is better
suited for a mechanical pursuit, he should direct
his attention to it, and educate him for it. And
thus in all respects he should obey the great law of
correspondence between the taste and capacity of

the child, and the occupation to be chosen for
him.</p>

<p class="dgp">The violation of this law does great injury to
the child and to society, inasmuch as it prevents
his success and contentment, and floods the state
with quacks and humbuggery. The parent should
never compel the child to learn a trade or profession
which he dislikes, and for which he shows no
talents. Many parents, through a false pride,
force their children into a profession for which
they have neither inclination nor capacity. While
the parent has a right to interfere in the choice of
a pursuit, his interference should not be arbitrary,
neither should it run counter to the will of the
child unless for special moral and religious reasons,
or on account of inability to gratify him.
However, this is often done. Even though they
acknowledge their unfitness for a profession, yet
their misguided pride prompts them to drag their
children into a calling which in after life they
disgrace.</p>

<p class="dgp">Some parents, on the other hand, through a
penurious spirit, refuse to aid their sons in their
preparation for a profession for which their talents
eminently qualify them. They refuse to educate
their sons for the ministry because it is not a lucrative
calling, though they give evidence of both
mental and moral adaptation for that holy office.
Others, through a blind zeal and a false pride,
force their sons into this sacred calling. Mistaken
parents! rather let your children break stone upon
the road, or dig in the earth, yea, rather let

them beg their bread, than thrust them into an
occupation to which God has not called them, and
for which they have neither inclination nor talents,
and in which they would, perhaps, not only
ruin their own souls, but contribute to the damnation
of others. "There are diversities of gifts
and of operations." All are not called nor fitted
for the ministry. Children soon give indications
of specific talents and suitableness for a calling in
life. We should critically observe their early propensities.
These will indicate their peculiar talents.
Unfit for and disliking an occupation, they
will become unsettled, and dissatisfied, and at best
will be but mimics and quacks. Their business
will make them sullen slaves. It is because of
parental disobedience to this law of adaptation
that we have so much humbuggery in the world
at the present day. Study, therefore, the infantile
predilections of your children to particular employments.
These will be an index to their providential
calling, and should govern your choice
for them.</p>

<p class="dgp">The social position of the child should also be
considered. If possible, the character of his pursuits
should not conflict with those social elements
in which he has been reared up. It should not
detract from his standing in society, nor disrupt
his associations in life. Many parents, for the sake
of money, will refuse to educate and fit their children
for sustaining the position they hold in society.
They bring them up in ignorance, and
devote them exclusively to Mammon; and then

when thrown upon their own resources they are
qualified neither in manners nor in pursuit for a
continuance in those peculiar relations to society
which they at first sustained.</p>

<p class="dgp">The exigencies of the child should also be considered.
If his home can afford him no patrimony,
it is then more important to consider the
lucrative character of the pursuit chosen, and also
the demands of that social position he is to maintain
in life. Its profits should then be fully adequate
to these demands, and suited to the emergencies
which are peculiar to his circumstances.
The capital required to engage in it, and its bearing
upon the health of body and mind, should
also be regarded. This is an important consideration,
and not sufficiently attended to by parents.
How many children are forced into employments
which they have not the means of carrying on,
and for which their state of health altogether unfits
them! A pursuit involving sedentary habits
does not suit a child whose state of health demands
exercise.</p>

<p class="dgp">You should make choice of but one pursuit for
your child, and discourage in him the American
tendency to be "jack of all trades." One occupation,
whatever it may be, whether trade or profession,
if properly pursued, will demand all his
energies, and give him no time to follow another;
and besides, it will afford him an ample subsistence.
There is much truth in the two old and
quaint adages, "jack of all trades, and master of
none;" "he has too many irons in the fire,&mdash;some

of them must burn!" Show your children the
truth and application of these.</p>

<p class="dgp">But while this is one extreme, and detrimental
to the interests of the child, its opposite extreme,
viz., that of bringing up the child to no pursuit
whatever, is still more injurious. We had better
have too many irons in the fire than none at all.
It is a base and cowardly desertion of duty to
shrink from the task of human occupation. Constituted
as human society is, the members of it
being mutually dependent upon each other for
support, it is evident that our happiness materially
depends upon the active concurrence of each individual
in the general system of social well-being.
He who withholds, therefore, his coöperation and
stands aloof from all employment, destroys a link
in that chain of things by which the fabric of society
is kept together and preserved. He is unfaithful
to those sacred obligations which arise
out of our relations to the state and the church,
and he abuses those inalienable rights with which
God has invested the social compact. Besides,
he fails to meet those conditions upon which the
vigorous development of individual life and character
depends. Indolence is no friend either to
physical, mental or moral development. The
body becomes imbecile, the spirit supine and sentimental,
the morals vitiated, and the mind sinks
into complete puerility. Activity is a law of all
life, and the condition of its healthy development
and maturity. Without it we resort to jejune
amusement, and from amusement we are hurried

on to dissipation, to the card table and dram shop;
and from dissipation we sink to degradation, infamy
and wretchedness. Idleness is thus the
fruitful mother of vice and misery. Our lives
cannot exist in a state of neutrality between active
good and active evil. It is, therefore, the
duty of the Christian home to prepare her young members
for some useful calling in life, not only
as a means of subsistence, but also as a safeguard
against the evils of idleness.</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XXII&mdash;The Home-Parlor.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The foolish floatiness of vanity, and solemn trumperies of pride,&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Harmful copings with the better, and empty-headed apings of the worse;</p>
<p class="l">Vapid pleasures, the weariness of gaiety, the strife and bustle of the world;</p>
<p class="l">The hollowness of courtesies, and substance of deceits, idleness and pastime&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">All these and many more alike, thick conveying fancies,</p>
<p class="l">Flit in throngs about my theme, as honey-bees at even to their hives!"</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">The Christian home includes the parlor. This
department we must give but a brief and passing
notice. Yet it is as important and responsible as
the nursery. In it we have a view of the relations
of home to society beyond it. The parlor
is set apart for social communion with the world.
Much of momentous interest is involved in this
relation. The choice of companions, the forming
of attachments and matrimonial alliances, the

establishment of social position and influence in
life beyond the family,&mdash;these are all involved in
the home-parlor.</p>

<p class="dgp">If we would, therefore, escape the shackles and
contamination of corrupt society, we must hold
the parlor sacred and give to it the air and bearing
of at least a moral aristocracy. Home is the
first form of society. The law of love rules and
reigns there. It is enthroned in the heart, and
casts light around our existence. In that society
we live above the trammels of artificial life. In
its parlor the members merge with society beyond
its sacred precincts. Hence it is the most beautiful
room; the best furniture is there; smiles adorn
it; friends meet there; fashion meets there in
her silks and jewels, with her circumstance and
custom, her sympathies, antipathies and divers
kinds of conversation; form and profession reign
there; flatteries and hypocrisies intrude themselves
there; pledges are given there; attachments
and vows are made there; the mind and
heart are impressed and moulded there; the cobweb
lines of etiquette are drawn there; a panorama
of social fascinations pass before the youthful
eye there,&mdash;these make the parlor the most
dangerous department of home. There the young
receive their first introduction to society; there
they see the world in all the brilliancy of outward
life, in the pomp and pageantry of a vanity fair.
All seems to them as a fairy dream, as a brilliant
romance; their hearts are allured by these outward
attractions; their imaginations are fed upon

the unreal, and they learn to judge character by
the external habiliments in which its reality is
concealed. They estimate worth by the beauty
of the face and form, by the cost of dress and the
genuflections of the body. They form their notions
of happiness from fashion, fortune and position.
They become enslaved to love-sick novels
and fashionable amusements. There, too, they
make choice of companions; there they form
matrimonial alliances; there their hearts are developed,
their minds trained for social life, their
affections directed, and influence brought to bear
upon them, which will determine their weal or
their woe.</p>

<p class="dgp">If such be the influence of the home-parlor,
should it not be held sacred, and made to correspond,
in all the uses for which it is set apart, with
the spirit and character of a Christian family;
and should not its doors be effectually guarded
against the intrusion of spurious and demoralizing
elements of society?</p>

<p class="dgp">Parents should teach their children all about
the character, interests and deceptions of parlor-life.
They should undeceive them in their natural
proneness to judge people from the standpoint
of character assumed in the parlor. They see the
lamb there, but not the lion; the smile but not
the frown; the affability of manner, but not the
tyranny of spirit. They hear the language of
flattery, but not the tongue of slander. They see
no weak points, detect no evil temper and bad
habits. There is an artificial screen behind which

all that is revolting and dangerous is concealed.
Who would venture to judge a person by his mechanical
movements in the parlor? Many are
there the very opposite to what they are elsewhere:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Abroad too kind, at home &#8217;tis steadfast hate,</p>
<p class="l">And one eternal tempest of debate.</p>
<p class="l">What foul eruptions from a look most meek!</p>
<p class="l">What thunders bursting from a dimpled cheek!</p>
<p class="l">Such dead devotion, such zeal for crimes,</p>
<p class="l">Such licensed ill, such masquerading times,</p>
<p class="l">Such venal faiths, such misapplied applause,</p>
<p class="l">Such flattered guilt, and such inverted laws!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">One of the most dangerous periods of life is,
when we leave the nursery and school, and enter
the parlor. With what solicitude, therefore,
should Christian parents guard their parlors from
social corruption. They should prepare their
children for society, not only by teaching them
its manners and customs, how to act in company,
how to grace a party, and move with refined ease
among companions there, but also by teaching
them the dangers and corruptions which lurk in
their midst and follow in the train of rustling
silks and fashionable denouement. They should
never permit their parlor to become the scene of
fashionable tyranny. The Christian parlor can
be no depot for fashion. It should be sacred to
God and to the church. It should be a true exponent
of the social elements of Christianity. It
should not be a hermitage, a state of seclusion
from the world; but should conform to fashion,

yet so far only as the laws of a sanctified taste and
refinement will admit.</p>

<p class="dgp">These laws exclude all compromise and amalgamation
with the ungodly spirit and customs of the
world. Allegiance to the higher and better law
of God will keep us from submission to the laws
of a depraved taste and carnal desire. We must
keep ourselves unspotted from the world. Whenever
we submit with scrupulous exactness to the
laws of fashion; whenever we yield a servile complaisance
to its forms and ceremonies, wink at its
extremes and immoralities and absurd expenditures,
seek its flatteries and indulge in its whims
and caprices, by throwing open our parlors as the
theatre of their denouement, and introducing our
children to their actors and master-spirits, we
prostitute our homes, our religion and those whom
God has given us to train up for Himself, to interests
and pleasures the most unworthy the Christian
name and character.</p>

<p class="dgp">There is much danger now of the Christian
home becoming in this way slavishly bound to the
influence and attractions of society beyond the
pale of the church, until all relish for home-enjoyment
is lost, and its members no longer seek
and enjoy each other&#8217;s association. They drain
the cup of voluptuous pleasure to its dregs, and
flee from home as jejune and supine. The husband
leaves his wife, and seeks his company in
fashionable saloons, at the card table or in halls
of revelry. The wife leaves the society of her
children, and in company with a bosom companion,

seeks to throw off the tedium of home, at
masquerade meetings, at the theater or in the
ball-room, where</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Vice, once by modest Nature chained,</p>
<p class="l">And legal ties, expatiates unrestrained;</p>
<p class="l">Without thin decency held up to view,</p>
<p class="l">Naked she stalks o&#8217;er law and gospel too!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The children follow their example; become
disgusted with each other&#8217;s company, and sacrifice
their time and talents to a thousand little trifles
and absurdities. Taste becomes depraved,
and loses all relish for rational enjoyment. The
heart teems with idle fancies and vain imaginations.
Sentimentalism takes the place of religion;
filthy literature and fashionable cards shove
the Family Bible in some obscure nook of their
parlor and their hearts. The hours devoted to
family prayer are now spent in a giddy whirl of
amusement and intoxicating pleasure, in the study
of the latest fashions and of the newly-published
love adventures of some nabob in the world of
refined scoundrelism. The parental solicitude,
once directed to the eternal welfare of the child,
is now expended in match-making and setting
out in the world.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thus does the Christian home often become
adulterated with the world by its indiscriminate
association with unfit social elements. That portion
of society whose master-spirits are love-stricken
poets, languishing girls, amorous grandmothers,
and sap-headed fiction writers, is certainly

unfit for a place in the parlor of the Christian
family. We should not permit the principles of
common-sense decorum to give place to the lawless
vagaries of fancy and the hollow-hearted
forms of artificial life. Under the gaudy drapery
of smiles and flounces, of rustling silks and blandishments,
there are hearts as brutish and stultified,
and heads as brainless and incapable of gentle
and moral emotion, and characters as selfish
and ungenerous, as were ever concealed beneath
the rags of poverty, or the uncouth manners and
rough garb of the incarcerated villain!</p>

<p class="dgp">It is, therefore, beneath the dignity of the
Christian to permit his home to become in any
way a prey to immoral and irreligious associations
and influences. Like the personal character of
the Christian, it should be kept unspotted from
the world; and no spirit, no customs, no companions,
opposed to religion, should be permitted to
enter its sacred limits. Heedless of this important
requisition, parents may soon see their children
depart from the ways in which they were
trained in the nursery, and at last become a curse
to them, and bring down their gray hairs with
sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p class="dgp">Here is indeed the great fault of many Christian
parents in the present day. They do not
exert that guardian care they should over the
social relations and interests of their children.
They are too unscrupulous in their introduction
to the world, and leave them in ignorance of its
snares and deceptions. What results can they

look for if they permit their parlor tables to become
burdened with French novels, and their
children to mingle in company whose influence is
the most detrimental to the interests of pure and
undefiled religion? Can they reflect upon their
daughters for forming improper attachments and
alliances? Can they wonder if their sons become
desperadoes, and ridicule the religion of their
parents? No! They permitted them to dally with
the fangs of a viper which found a ready admittance
into their parlor; and upon them, therefore,
will rest the responsibility,&mdash;yea, the deep and
eternal curse! Woe unto thee, thou unfaithful
parent; the voice of thy children&#8217;s blood shall
send up from the hallowed ground of home, one
loud and penetrating cry to God for vengeance;
and thou shalt be "beaten with many stripes." It
will not only cry out against you, but cling to you!</p>

<p class="dgp">Guard your parlor, therefore, from the corrupting
influence of all immoral associations. Be
not carried away by the pomp and glare of refined
and decorated wickedness. Let not the ornaments
and magnificence of mere outward life divert
your attention from those hidden principles
which prompt to action. In the choice of companions
for your children in the parlor, look to
the ornaments of the heart rather than to those
of the body. Be not allured by the parade of circumstance
and position in life: Be not carried
away by that which may intoxicate for a moment,
and then leave the heart in more wretchedness
than before. Ever remember that the future condition

of your children, their domestic character
and happiness, will depend upon the kind of company
you admit in your parlor. This leads us to
the consideration of the part Christian parents
should take in the marriage of their children.
This we shall investigate in our next chapter under
the head of "Match-making."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">One of the most affecting scenes of home-life
is that of the bridal hour! Though in one sense
it is a scene of joy and festivity; yet in another,
it is one of deep sadness. When all is adorned
with flowers and smiles, and the parlor becomes
the theater of conviviality and parade, even then
hearts are oppressed with sorrow at the thought
of that separation which is soon to take place.</p>

<p class="dgp">The bridal is a home-crisis. It is the breaking
up of home-ties and communion, a separation from

home scenes, a lopping off from the parent vine,
an engrafting into a strange vine, and alas! too
often, into a degenerate vine. As the youthful
bride stands beside her affianced husband, to be
wedded to him for life, and reflects that the short
ceremonial of that occasion will tear her forever
from the loved, objects and scenes of her childhood-home,
what tears of bitter sorrow adorn the
bridal cheek, and what pungent feelings are awakened
by her last farewell!</p>

<p class="l">To trace the hours which ne&#8217;er can return.&#8217;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If momentous interests&#8217; are involved in marriage,
then, we think that parents should take an
important part in the matrimonial alliances of
their children. When they grow up, they naturally
seek a companion for life. The making
choice of that companion is a crisis in their history,
and will determine their future interest and
happiness. If separation from home is a great
sacrifice, then we should look well to the grounds
of our justification in making that sacrifice.</p>

<p class="dgp">We propose, under the head of "match-making,"
to consider the part which parents should
take in the marriage of their children; and also
the false and true standards of judgment both for
parents and their children, in making the marriage
choice and alliance.</p>

<p class="dgp">Have parents a right to take any part in the

marriage choice and alliance of their children?
Have they a right to interfere in any respect with
the marriage of their children? That they do
possess such a right, and are justified in the exercise
of it within just and reasonable limits, is, we
think, undisputed by any one acquainted with the
Word of God. It is one of the cardinal prerogatives
and duties of the Christian parent. His relation
to his children invests him with it. The
age and inexperience of the child, on the one
hand; and the seductions of the world, on the
other; imply it. Children need counsel and admonition;
and this is a needs be for the interposition
of the parent&#8217;s superior wisdom and greater
experience.</p>

<p class="dgp">This right is plainly exemplified in sacred history.
Abraham interfered in Isaac&#8217;s selection of
a companion. Isaac and Rebecca aided in the
choice of a wife for Jacob. And indeed throughout
the patriarchal age, you find this right recognized
and practiced. It was also acknowledged
and exercised in all the subsequent ages of Judaism,
in the age of primitive Christianity, and even
down to the present time, in every true Christian
household. The right still exists, and receives
the sanction of the church. The great dereliction
of parents now is, that they do not exercise
it; and of children, that they do not recognize
it. "A wise son heareth his father&#8217;s instructions."
"The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth
to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall
pluck it out, and the young eagles shall eat it."</p>



<p class="dgp">What now is the extent, and what are the duties
of that right to interfere? This is a difficult
question, and can receive but an imperfect answer.
In infancy the authority of the parent is exercised
without any reference to the will of the child, because
reason is not yet developed. But when
he reaches the age of personal accountability, the
control of the parent is exercised on more liberal
principles; and when, by age, he becomes a responsible
citizen, the legal authority of the parent
ceases. Still he possesses moral authority, and
has a right to exert a restraining influence over
the child. This does not, of course, involve a
right to compel him to yield to the parent&#8217;s arbitrary
will. He can exert but a moral control over
him; and it is the child&#8217;s duty to yield to this,
so long as it is consistent with scripture and the
maxims of sound reason and conscience. He
should consult his parents, receive them into his
confidence, and give priority to their judgment
and counsels.</p>

<p class="dgp">Parents have the right to use coercive measures
to prevent an imprudent marriage by their children
before they have arrived at age; for until
they are of age they are both legally and morally
under the authority and government of their parents,
who are responsible for them. Hence the
child should recognize and submit to their authority.
But this right to the use of coercive
measures extends only to the prevention of unhappy
marriages,&mdash;not to the forming of what
the parents may regard happy alliances, against

the will of the child. No parent has the right to
compel a child under age to marry, because the
marriage alliance implies the age and free choice
of the child.</p>

<p class="dgp">But when the child reaches legal maturity, the
coercive authority of the parent ceases. His interposition
then should not involve coercive, but
persuasive measures. Then a mere mechanical
prevention of an unhappy marriage would have
no good moral effect, but would be productive of
great evil, inasmuch as it not only involves parental
despotism, but the restriction of a manifest
and conceded right of the child. It would destroy
the sense of personal dignity and responsibility.</p>

<p class="dgp">Persuasive measures will then accomplish more
than all the efforts of the parent to prevent an unhappy
union, by threats of disinheritance and expulsion
from home. In this way parents often
extend their interference to most unreasonable
extremes, and to the great detriment of the interests
and happiness of their children; while at
the same time they often bring disgrace and misery
upon their own heads and home. They set
themselves up as the choosers of companions for
their children, presuming that they should passively
submit to their selection whatever it may
be. This is taking away the free moral agency of
the child, making no account of his taste, judgment,
or affections; and forming between him and
the object thus chosen a mere outward union, with
no inward affinity.</p>



<p class="dgp">In such cases it most generally happens that
parents are prompted by sinister motives and a
false pride, as that of wealth, honor, and social
position. They do not consult the law of suitability,
but that of availability. They think that
wealth and family distinction will compensate
for the absence of all moral and amiable qualities,
that if outward circumstances are favorable,
there need not be inward adaptation of character.
Hence they will dictate to their children,
make their marriage alliance a mere business matter,
and demand implicit obedience on the penalty
of expulsion from the parental home, and disinheritance
forever. They are thus willing to prostitute
the domestic peace and happiness of their
offspring to the gratification of their own sordid
and inordinate lust for gain and empty distinction.</p>

<p class="dgp">Who does not perceive and acknowledge the
evil of such a course? It involves unfeeling despotism
on the one hand, and a servile obedience
on the other. The affections are abused; the idea
and sacredness of marriage are left out of view;
the conditions of domestic felicity are not met.
All is supremely selfish; the power exercised is
arbitrary; the submission is slavish and demoralizing;
the obedience involuntary and degrading;
and the result of it all is, an outrage against nature,
against marriage, and against God.</p>

<p class="dgp">On the other hand, the interference of the parent
should be persuasive, and the obedience of
the child, voluntary. The parent should reason

with and counsel the child; and seek by mild and
affectionate means to secure obedience to his advice.
And if the child then persist in his own
course, the parent, we think, has discharged his
duty, and the responsibility will rest upon the
child. He should not expel and disinherit him,
and thus add the hard-heartedness of the parent to
the folly and perversity of the child. He should
love him still, and seek by parental tenderness to
alleviate the sad fruits of filial recklessness. Parents
should so train their children in the nursery
and parlor, by instilling in them correct principles
of judgment in the choice of a companion, as to
secure them ever after from an imprudent choice.
Here is the place to begin. Parents too often omit
this duty, until alas, it is too late.</p>

<p class="dgp">We have now seen that the parent has no right
to destroy the domestic happiness of a child by
uniting him forcibly in wedlock to one for whom
he has no true affection. On the other hand, the
child should pay due deference to the parent&#8217;s
moral suasion, and seek, if possible, to follow
his counsels. "A child," says Paley, "who respects
his parent&#8217;s judgment, and is, as he ought
to be, tender of their happiness, owes, at least,
so much deference to their will, as to try fairly
and faithfully, in one case, whether time and absence
will not cool an affection which they disapprove.
After a sincere but ineffectual endeavor
by the child, to accommodate his inclination to
his parent&#8217;s pleasure, he ought not to suffer in his
parent&#8217;s affections, or in his fortunes. The parent,

when he has reasonable proof of this, should
acquiesce; at all events, the child is then at liberty
to provide, for his own happiness."</p>

<a name="toc_31"></a>
<h3 class="dgp">Section II&mdash;False Tests In The Selection Of A Companion For Life.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Before we advert to some of those biblical
principles upon which parents and children
should proceed in the marriage choice, we shall
take a negative view of the subject, and mention
some of those false principles and considerations
which have in the present day gained a fearful
ascendancy over the better judgment of many
professed Christians.</p>

<p class="dgp">In the matter of marriage, too many are influenced
by the pomp and parade of the mere outward.
The glitter of gold, the smile of beauty,
and the array of titled distinction and circumstance,
act like a charm upon the feelings and
sentiments of many well-meaning parents and
children. But it is not all gold that glitters.
We must not think that those are happy in
their marriage union, because they are obsequious
in their attentions to each other, and live

together in splendor, overloaded with fashionable
congratulations. We cannot determine the character
of a marriage from its pomp and pageantry.
We rather determine the many unhappy matches
from the false principles upon which the parties
acted in making choice of each other. What are
some of these? We answer&mdash;</p>

<p class="dgp">1. The manner of paying addresses involves a
false principle of procedure. These are either
too long or too short, and paid in an improper
spirit and manner. There are too much flirtation
and romance connected with them. The
religious element is not taken up and considered.
They do not involve the true idea of
preparation, but have an air of mere sentimentalism
about them. The object in view is not
fully seen. The most reprehensible motives and
the most shocking thoughtlessness pervade them
throughout. These addresses carry with them an
air of trifling, a want of seriousness and frankness,
which betrays the absence of all sense of
responsibility, and of all proper views of the sacredness
of marriage and of its momentous consequences
both for time and for eternity.</p>

<p class="dgp">2. The habit of match-making involves a false
principle. This we see more fully among the
higher classes of society. It is the work of designing
and interested persons, who, for self-interest,
intrude their unwelcome interposition. Its
whole procedure implies that marriage is simply
a legal matter, a piece of business policy, a domestic
speculation. It strikes out the great law

of mutual, moral love, and personal adaptation.
It makes marriage artificial, and apprehends it as
only a mechanical copartnership of interest and
life. It is sinister in spirit, and selfish in the end.
Many are prompted from motives of novelty to
make matches among their friends. All their
schemes tend to wrest from the parties interested
all true judgment and dispassionate consideration.
They are deceived by base misrepresentation,
allured by over-wrought pictures of
conjugal felicity, so that when the marriage is
consummated, they soon find their golden dreams
vanish away, and with them, their hopes and their
happiness forever.</p>

<p class="dgp">But there are not only personal match-makers,
in the form of tyrannical fathers, sentimental
mothers, amorous grandmothers, and obsequious
friends; but also book match-makers, in the form
of love-sick tales and poetry, containing Eugene-Aram
adventures, and scrapes of languishing girls
with titled swains running off, calculated to heat
the youthful imagination, distort the pictures of
fancy, giving to marriage the air of a romantic
adventure, and throwing over it a gaudy drapery,
leading the young into a world of dreams and
nonentities, where all is but a bubble of variegated
colors and fantastic forms, which explodes
before them as soon as it is touched by the finger
of reality and experience.</p>

<p class="dgp">These are the most dangerous match-makers.
Their sister companions in this evil are, the ball-room,
the giddy dance and masquerade, the fashionable

wine-cup and the costly apparel. Let me
affectionately exhort the members of the Christian
home to keep all these at a distance. Touch not,
taste not, handle not! They will poison the spirit
and the affections, and encircle you with a viper&#8217;s
coil from which there is no hope of escape. Here
parents have a right, and it is their duty, to interfere.
They can do so effectually by not allowing
such filthy match-making intruders to pass the
threshold of their homes. What can you expect
out an unhappy marriage, if you permit your sons
and daughters to spend their time in converse with
love-sick tales and languishing swains? They will
become love-sick, too, and long for marriage with
one who is like the hero of their last-read romance.
Perhaps they will not think their matrimonial debut
sufficiently flavored with romantic essence, unless
they run off with some self-constituted count,
or at least with their papa&#8217;s Irish groom!</p>

<p class="dgp">3. We might advert, finally, to some of those
false influences which are frequently brought to
bear upon the children&#8217;s choice of a companion
for life. The term smitten is here significant
and deserves our serious consideration. It carries
in its pregnant meaning the evidence of a
spurious feeling, and a false foundation of love
and union. Be it remembered that there must
always be something to smite one. We may
be smitten by a scoundrel, or by something unworthy
our affections. Empty titles and mustaches
often smite the susceptible young. Sometimes
the heart is smitten by a pretty face and

form; and sometimes by a rod of gold. The
simple fact that we are smitten is not enough;
we should know who or what it is that smites us.
When we are drawn to each other, it should be by
a true cord, and by an influence which binds and
cements for life. The influence of mere outward
beauty is a false one. Those who are smitten by
it, and drawn thus into a matrimonial union by an
interest which is but skin-deep, and which may
fade like the morning flower, are allured by a dazzling
meteor, by a mere bubble, beautifully formed
and colored, but empty within. It may dazzle the
eye, but it blinds us to all its blemishes and inward
infirmities. It is deceptive. Often beneath
its gaudy veil there lies the viper, ready to poison
all the sweets of home-life, and cause its victim to
lament over his folly with bitter tears and heart-burning
remorse. How soon may beauty fade;
and what then, if it was the only basis of your
marriage choice? The union which rested upon
it must then be at least morally dissolved; and
that which once flitted like an impersonated charm
before your admiring eye, now becomes an object
of disgust and a source of misery.</p>

<p class="dgp">To fall in love, therefore, with mere outward
beauty is, to dandle with a doll, to fawn upon a
picture, to rest your hopes upon a plaything, to
pursue a phantom which, as soon as you embrace
it, may vanish into nothing. Look not to external
beauty alone; but also to the ornaments of an inward
spirit, of a noble mind, and an amiable and
pious heart. "If," says the Rev. H. Harbaugh,

"you will be foolish, follow the gilded butterfly of
beauty, drive it a long chase; it will land you at
last at some stagnant mud-pond of the highway."</p>

<p class="dgp">Neither is impulsive passion a true basis of marriage.
This is falling in love at first sight, which
often proves to be a very dangerous and degrading
fall,&mdash;a fall from the clouds to the clods, producing
both humiliation and misery. It is indeed
a fearful leap,&mdash;a leap without judgment or forethought;
and, therefore, a leap in the dark. It is
too precipitate, and shows the infatuation of the
victim. Falling in love is not always falling in
the embraces of domestic felicity. Such leaping
is an act of intoxication. The drunkard, falling
in the mire, often thinks that he is embracing his
best friend, whereas it is but descending to fellowship
with the swine. It is blind love, which is no
love, but passion without reason. It is crazy, fitful,
stormy, raising the feelings up to boiling point,
and bringing the affections under the influence of
the high-pressure system. Consequently it is raving,
frothy, of a mushroom growth, making mere
bubbles, and completing its work in an evaporation
of all that it operated upon, passing away like
the morning cloud and the early dew.</p>

<p class="dgp">True love is very different. It is substantial,
reasonable, moral, acting according to law, temperate
in all things, keeping the heart from extremes,
permanent, and based upon principle.
Passion, without love, may keep you in a state
of pleasurable intoxication until the knot is tied,
when you will soon get sober again, only to see,

however, your folly and to contemplate the height
from which you have fallen, and then, with the
recklessness of sullen despair, to pass over into
the opposite extreme of stoical indifference and
misery. All emotions are transient, and hence no
proper standard of judgment in the serious matter
of a marriage choice. The heart, unguided by
the head, is, in its emotions, like the flaming meteor
that passes in its rapid, fiery train across the
heavens. It flames only for a time, and soon
passes away, leaving the heavens in greater darkness
than before.</p>

<p class="dgp">Neither is wealth a true basis for the marriage
choice. "The love of money is the root of all
evil;" and when it is the primary desideratum in
marriage, it acts like a canker-worm upon domestic
peace and happiness. With too many in this
day of money-making, marriage is but a pecuniary
speculation, a mere gold and silver affair; and
their match-making is but a money-making, that
is, money makes the match. Many parents (but
we don&#8217;t call such Christians,) sacrifice their children
upon the altar of mammon, and prostitute
their earthly and eternal happiness to their love
of filthy lucre.</p>

<p class="dgp">Fatal mistake! Will money make your children
happy? Is it for money you have them led
to the bridal altar? Ah! that sordid dust may
cover the grave of their fondest hopes and connubial
felicity. Wed not your children to mere dollars
and cents. The hand that holds a purse and
shakes it before you for your child, may hold also a

dagger for both the child and the parent. "Look
not only for riches, lest thou be mated with misery."
Wealth is good in its place, and we should
not object to it, other things being equal. But it
never was nor can be good as an inducement to
marry. What a miserable policy it is, to make
it the test of a proper match! "Do not make
the metals of earth the cord of the marriage
tie." They are too brittle in their nature to
do so. They take to themselves wings and fly
away. The fine gold becomes dim; their cords
are like ropes of glass-sand,&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Like the spider&#8217;s most attenuated thread,</p>
<p class="l">They break at every breeze."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Rank also is a false standard of judgment in
the forming of a marriage alliance. Many look
only to position in society, make it everything,
and think that acknowledged social distinction
will compensate for the want of all other interests.
While there should be a social adaptation
of character, and while you should&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Be joined to thy equal in rank, or the foot of pride will kick at thee,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">yet there is nothing to justify marrying a person
because of his or her social position. The evils
of this may be seen in the first classes of English
society, where rank is mechanical, and where law
forbids a trespass upon its bastard prerogatives;
and as a consequence, relatives intermarry, until
their descendants have degenerated into complete

physical and mental imbecility. Such nepotism
as this is replete with untold disaster both in the
family and in the state. Too many in our democratic
country ape this, look to rank, and are blind
to all things else. The fruits of this are seen in
that codfish aristocracy which floats with self-inflated
importance upon the troubled waters of society,
causing too many of the little fish to float
after them, until they land themselves in the deep
and muddy waters of domestic ruin.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Section III&mdash;True Tests In The Selection Of A Companion For Life.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Having considered some of the false standards
of judgment in the choice of a companion for life,
we now revert to those true tests which are given
us in the Word of God. There we have the institution
and true idea of marriage, and the principles
upon which we should proceed in making the
marriage choice.</p>

<p class="dgp">We are taught in the holy scriptures, the primary
importance of judicious views of the nature
and responsibilities of the marriage institution itself.
We should apprehend it, not from its mere
worldly standpoint, not as a simple legal alliance,
not only as a scheme for temporal welfare and happiness,

but as a divine institute, a religious alliance,
involving moral responsibilities, and momentous
consequences for eternity as well as for time, for
soul as well as for body. We are commanded to
look to its religious elements and duties; and to
regard it with that solemnity of feeling which it
truly demands. When the light of the bridal day
throws upon the cheek its brightest colors, even
then we should rejoice with trembling, and our
joy and festivity should be only in the Lord.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Joy, serious and sublime,</p>
<p class="l">Such as doth nerve the energies of prayer,</p>
<p class="l">Should swell the bosom, when a maiden&#8217;s hand,</p>
<p class="l">Filled with life&#8217;s dewy flowerets, girdeth on</p>
<p class="l">That harness which the ministry of death</p>
<p class="l">Alone unlooseth, but whose fearful power</p>
<p class="l">May stamp the sentence of eternity."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the days of our forefathers, marriage was
thus held sacred, as a divine institution, involving
moral and religious duties and responsibilities;
and their celebration of it was, therefore, a religious
one. They realized its momentous import,
and its bearing upon their future welfare. It was
not, therefore, without heavings of deep moral
emotion and the flow of tears as well as of joyful
spirits, that they put the wedding garment on.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"There are smiles and tears in that gathering band,</p>
<p class="l">Where the heart is pledged with the trembling hand</p>
<p class="l">What trying thoughts in the bosom swell,</p>
<p class="l">As the bride bids parents and home farewell!</p>
<p class="l">Kneel down by the side of the tearful fair,</p>
<p class="l">And strengthen the perilous hour with prayer!"</p>
</div>



<p class="dgp">True love in each, and reciprocated by each, must
determine the marriage choice. The marriage of
children should not be forced. Mutual love is the
basis of a proper union, because marriage is a voluntary
compact. When parents, therefore, force
their children into an alliance, they usurp their
undoubted natural and religious rights. Hence
there should be no <em>must</em>, where there is no <em>will</em>, on
the part of the child. That choice which is made
upon any other than reciprocated affection, is an
unreasonable and irreligious one. "Parents have
no right," says Paley, "to urge their children
upon marriage to which they are averse;" "add
to this," says he, "that compulsion in marriage
necessarily leads to prevarication; as the reluctant
party promises an affection, which neither exists,
nor is expected to take place." To proceed
to marriage, therefore in the face of absolute dislike
and revulsion, is irrational and sinful.</p>

<p class="dgp">As true, mutual love is the basis of marriage, so
also should it be a standard of our judgment in
the marriage choice. Without it, neither beauty,
wealth, nor rank will make home happy. True
love should be such as is upheld in scripture. It
is above mere passion. It never faileth. It is
life-like and never dies out. It is an evergreen
in the bosom of home. It has moral stamina, is
regulated by moral law, has a moral end, contains
moral principle, and rises superior to mere prudential
considerations. It is more than mere feeling
or emotion; it is not blind, but rational, and
above deception, having its ground in our moral

and religious nature. It extends to the whole person,
to body, mind, and spirit, to the character as
well as to the face and form. It is tempered with
respect, yea, vitalized, purified, directed and elevated
by true piety. Such love alone will survive
the charms and allurements of novelty, the fascinations
of sense, the ravages of disease and time,
and will receive the sanction of heaven.</p>

<p class="dgp">Mutual adaption of character and position is
another scripture standard of judgment. Is that
person suited for me? Will that character make
my home happy? Could I be happy with such an
one? Are we congenial in spirit, sentiment, principle,
cultivation, education, morals and religion?
Can we sympathize and work harmoniously together
in mind and heart and will and taste? Are
we complemental to each other? These are questions
of far greater importance than the question
of wealth, of beauty, or of rank.</p>

<p class="dgp">Fitness of circumstances, means, and age should
be also considered. Am I able to support a family?
Can I discharge the duties of a household?
Where there is ignorance of household duties, indolence,
the want of any visible means of supporting
a family, no trade, no education, no energy,
and no prospects, there is no reason to think
there can be a proper marriage. Thus, then, mutual
love, adaptation of character, of means, of circumstances,
of position, and of age, should be considered,
in the formation of a marriage alliance.</p>

<p class="dgp">But the standard of judgment to which the scriptures
especially direct our attention is, that of religions

equality, or spiritual adaptation. "Be not
unequally yoked together with unbelievers." The
positive command here is, that Christians should
marry only in the Lord. Here is a test in the selection
of a companion for life, from which neither
parents nor children should ever depart. It
evidently forbids a matrimonial union with those
who have no sympathy with religion. We should
make more account of religious equality than of
equality of rank and wealth. Is not true piety of
more importance than education, affluence or social
distinction? When husband and wife are unequally
yoked together in soul and grace, their
home must suffer spiritually as well as temporally.
The performance of religious duties and the
enjoyment of religious privileges, will be impossible.
The unbeliever will discourage, oppose, and
often ridicule, the pious efforts of the believer.
Partiality will be produced, and godliness will decline;
for, says Peter, unless we dwell as heirs together
of the grace of life, our prayers will be
hindered. The pious one cannot rule in such a
home. Thus divided and striving with each other,
their house must fall. Where one draws heavenward
and the other hellward, opposite attractions
will be presented, and the believer will find constant
obstructions to growth in grace, to the discharge
of parental duty, and to the cultivation of
Christian graces in the heart. How can the unbeliever
return, like David, to bless his household?
How can he bring up his children in the nurture
and admonition of the Lord? Can he be the head

of a Christian home? And, tell me, does the
true Christian desire any other than a Christian
home? "How can two walk together, except
they be agreed?" And are you, then, in your
marriage, agreed to walk with the unbeliever in
the broad road of sin and death? You are not,
if you are a true Christian!</p>

<p class="dgp">We see, therefore, the importance of a rigid
adherence to the scripture standard, "Be not unequally
yoked, together with unbelievers." It is
even desirable that husband and wife belong to
the same branch of the church, that they may
walk together on the sabbath to the house of
God. There is indeed something repugnant to
the feelings of a Christian to see the husband
go in one direction to worship, and the wife in
another. They cannot be thus divided, without
serious injury to the religious interests of their
family, as well as of their own souls. It is impossible
for them to train up their children successfully
when they are separated by denominational
differences. It is a matter of very common observation
that when persons thus divided, marry,
the one or the other suffers in religious interest.
From these and other considerations, we think it
Is expedient to marry, if possible, within the pales
of our own branch of the church. Then, being
agreed, they can walk together with one mind
and one purpose.</p>

<p class="dgp">But how much more important that they be
united in their pilgrim walk to eternity,&mdash;united
In the Lord Jesus Christ, by a common life and

faith and hope! We believe that Christians
commit a sin when they violate this law of religious
equality, and unite themselves in matrimony
with those who pay no regard to religion.
Who can estimate the peril of that home
in which one of its members is walking in the
narrow way to heaven, while the other one is traveling
in the broad road to perdition! Whom,
think you, will the children follow? Let the sad
experience of a thousand homes respond. Let the
blighted hopes and the unrequited affections of
the pious wife, reply. Let those children whose
infamy and wretchedness have broken the devout
mother&#8217;s heart, or brought the gray hairs of the
pious father down with sorrow to the grave, speak
forth the answer. It will show the importance of
the scripture rule before us, and will declare the
sin of violating that rule.</p>

<p class="dgp">And does not, therefore, a terrible judgment accompany
that indiscriminate matrimonial union
with the unbelieving world, of which so many
Christians, in the present day, are guilty? Parents
encourage their pious children to marry unbelievers,
though they are well aware that such
unholy mixtures are expressly forbidden, and that
spiritual harmony is essential to their happiness.
"She is at liberty to be married to whom she
will, only in the Lord!" Those who violate this
cardinal law of marriage, must expect to suffer
the penalties attached to it. History is the record
of these. The disappointed hopes, and the
miseries of unnumbered homes speak forth their

execution. This great scripture law has its foundation
in the very nature of marriage itself. If
marriage involves the law of spiritual harmony;
if, in the language of the Roman law, it is "the
union of a man and woman, constituting an united
habitual course of life, never to be separated;" if
it is a partnership of the whole life,&mdash;a mutual
sharing in all rights, human and divine; if they
are one flesh,&mdash;one in all the elements of their
moral being, as Christ and His church are one;
if it is a mystery of man&#8217;s being, antecedent to
all human law; if, in a word, man and woman in
marriage, are no more twain, but one flesh; and
if the oneness of our nature is framed of the body,
the soul, and the spirit, then is it not plain that
when two persons marry, who possess no spiritual
fitness for, or harmony with, each other, they violate
the fundamental law of wedlock; and their
marriage cannot meet the scripture conception of
matrimonial union or oneness. There will be no
adaptation of the whole nature for each other;
they will not appreciate the sacred mysteriousness
of marriage; instead of the moral and religious
development of the spiritual nature, there will be
the evolution of selfishness and sensuality as the
leading motives of domestic life. We see, then,
that the Christian cannot with impunity, violate
the scripture law, "Be not unequally yoked with
unbelievers."</p>

<p class="dgp">Shall the Christian parent and child disregard
this prohibition of God? Will you ridicule
this fundamental principle of Christian marriage?

Will the children of God not hesitate to marry
the children of the devil? Can these walk together,
in domestic union and harmony? Can
saint and sinner be of one mind, one spirit, one
life, one hope, one interest? Can the children of
the light and the children of darkness, opposite
in character and in their apprehension of things,
become flesh of each other&#8217;s flesh, and by the force
of their blended light and darkness shed, around
their home-fireside the cheerfulness of a mutual
love, of a common life and hope, and of a progressive
spiritual work?</p>

<p class="dgp">Parents! it is your right and duty to interfere
when your children violate this law. Bring them
up from infancy to respect it. In the parlor, train
them to appreciate its religious importance. Show
them that God will visit the iniquity of their departure
from it, unto the third and fourth generation.
You are stimulated to do so by the divine
promise that when they grow old, they will not
depart from it.</p>

<p class="dgp">Such unequal matches are not made in heaven.
"God&#8217;s hand is over such matches, not in them."
"What fellowship hath light with darkness?" If
love, in Christian marriages, is holy and includes
the religious element, then it is evident that the
Christian alliance with, one between whom and
himself there is no religious affinity whatever, is
not only an outrage against the marriage institution,
but also exposes his home to the curse of
God, making it a Babel of confusion and of moral
antipathies.</p>



<p class="dgp">Both the old and the new testaments give explicit
testimony to the law of spiritual harmony
in marriage. Thus the law of Moses forbid the
children of Israel to intermarry among heathen
nations. "Neither shalt thou make marriages
with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give
unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take
unto thy son."&mdash;Deut. vii., 3. Abraham obeyed
this law in the part he took in the marriage of
his son Isaac, as recorded in the twenty-fourth,
chapter of Genesis. His obedience was reproduced
in Isaac and Rebecca, who manifested the
same desire, and took the same care that Jacob
should take a wife from among the covenant
people of God. See twenty-eighth chapter of
Genesis.</p>

<p class="dgp">The evil consequences of the violation of this
law may be seen in the history of
Solomon,&mdash;i. Kings, chap. 11; also in the case mentioned in
the 10th chap.; and in Nehemiah, chap. 13. Paul
upholds this law when he exhorts the Corinthians
to marry "only in the Lord." Reason itself advocates
this law. The true Christian labors for
heaven and walks in the path of the just; the
unbelieving labor for earth, mind only the things
of this world, and walk in the broad road to ruin.
Can these now walk together, live in harmony,
when so widely different in spirit, in their aims
and pursuits? "What fellowship hath righteousness
with unrighteousness? What part hath he
that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement
hath the temple of God with idols? for ye

are the temple of the living God; as God hath
said, I will dwell in them; and I will be their
God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore
come out from among them, and be ye separate,
saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing;
and I will receive you, and will be a father unto
you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters."</p>

<p class="dgp">The primitive Christians developed this law in
their families. They forbade marriage with Jews,
Pagans, Mohammedans, and ungodly persons.
With them, piety was the first desideratum in
marriage. The sense of the Christian church has
ever been against religious inequality in marriage.
It has always been felt to be detrimental to personal
piety and to the general interests of Christianity.
It limits and neutralizes the influence
of the church, brings overwhelming temptations
to lukewarmness in family religion, and is, in a
word, in almost every instance, the fruitful cause
of spiritual declension wherever it is practiced.</p>

<p class="dgp">Let me, then, exhort you to marry only in the
Lord. Such an union will be blessed. Daughter
of Zion! marry such a man as will, like David,
return to bless his household. Son of the Christian
home! marry no woman who has not in her
heart the casket of piety. Make this your standard;
and your home shall be a happy, as well as
a holy home, and</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"In the blissful vision, each shall share</p>
<p class="l">As much of glory as his soul can bear!"</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XXIV&mdash;The Children&#8217;s Patrimony.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Give me enough, saith wisdom; for he feareth to ask for more;</p>
<p class="l">And that by the sweat of my brow, addeth stout-hearted independence;</p>
<p class="l">Give me enough, and not less; for want is leagued with the tempter;</p>
<p class="l">Poverty shall make a man desperate, and hurry him ruthless into crime;</p>
<p class="l">Give me enough, and not more, saving for the children of distress;</p>
<p class="l">Wealth oftentimes killeth, where want but hindereth the budding."</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">The children&#8217;s patrimony is a vital subject. It
involves the great question, what should Christian
parents leave to their children as a true inheritance
from the Christian home? We shall return
but a very brief and general answer.</p>

<p class="dgp">The idea of the home-inheritance is generally
confined to the amount of wealth which descends
from the parent to the child. And this is indeed
too often the only inheritance of which children
can boast. Many parents, who even claim to be
Christians, enslave both themselves and their families,

to secure for their offspring a large pecuniary
patrimony. They prostitute every thing else
to this. And hence it often happens that the
greatest money-inheritance becomes the children&#8217;s
greatest curse, running them into all the wild and
immoral excesses of prodigality; and ending in
abject poverty, licentiousness, and disgrace; or
perhaps making them like their deluded parents,
penurious, covetous, and contracted in all their
views and sentiments.</p>

<p class="dgp">We think, therefore, that the children&#8217;s patrimony
should be more than gold and silver. This
may pamper the body, but will afford no food for
the mind and spirit. We do not mean by these
remarks, that their patrimony should not include
wealth. On the other hand, we believe that parents
should make pecuniary provision for them,
that they may not begin life totally destitute.
But we mean, that when this is the only patrimony
they receive, it often proves a curse, because
it tends to destroy their sympathy with
higher interests, exposes them to the uncertainties
of wealth, and makes them dependent upon that
alone. If it should elude their grasp, all is gone,
and they become poor and helpless indeed.</p>

<p class="dgp">What, therefore, besides wealth, should be the
children&#8217;s patrimony from the Christian home?
We briefly answer.</p>

<p class="dgp">1. A good character. This is more valuable
than wealth; for a good name is rather to be chosen
than great riches. This character should be
physical, intellectual, and moral. Give your children

the boon of good health by a proper training
to exercise and industry. Transmit to them
the patrimony of good physical habits by educating
their bodies, and developing their material
existence according to the principles of natural
law. Develop their intellectual faculties, and enrich
them with, the treasures of knowledge. Give
character to their minds as well as to their bodies;
and they will be blessed with an intellectual dowry
which cannot be taken from them, and which will
bring them an adequate recompense. Give to
your children the patrimony of good and just
principles. Train the heart to good morals; fill
it with the treasures of virtue, of truth, of justice
and of honor. Give it moral stamina. Educate
the moral sense of your children. Direct the unfolding
powers of their conscience; in a word,
develop their moral faculties, and supply them
with appropriate nutriment; mould their will;
cultivate their emotions; rule their desires and
passions; and thus unfold their moral nature according
to the rules of God&#8217;s revealed law.</p>

<p class="dgp">Such a character, involving a true and vigorous
evolution of body, mind and spirit, is an effectual
safeguard against the evils of prodigality, the disgrace
of penuriousness, and the woes of vice and
crime. Their property may burn down, and they
may he robbed of their gold; but neither the flame
nor the robber can deprive them of their character;
their intellectual and moral worth, is beyond
the power of man to destroy; no enemy can rob
them of those virtues which a well-developed

mind and heart afford; they will be to them a
standing capital to enrich them in all that is essential
to human happiness.</p>

<p class="dgp">2. A good occupation is another patrimony
which should descend to the children of a Christian
home. Bring up your children to some useful
employment by which they may be able to
make a comfortable living; and you thereby give
them hundreds, and, perhaps, thousands of dollars
per year; you give them a boon which cannot
he taken from them. Many parents, hoping
to secure for their children a large pecuniary patrimony,
will not permit them to learn either a
trade or a profession; but let them grow up in indolence
and ignorance, unable as well as unwilling,
to be useful either to themselves or to others,
living for no purpose, and unfit even to take care
of what they leave. And when their wealth descends
to them, they soon spend it all in a life of
dissipation; so that in a few years they find themselves
poor, and friendless, and ignorant of all
means of a livelihood, without character, without
home, without hope, a nuisance to society, a disgrace
to their parents, a curse to themselves! But
as we have already dwelt upon this subject in the
chapter on the choice of pursuits, we shall not
enlarge upon it here.</p>

<p class="dgp">3. True religion is another inheritance which
should descend to the children of the Christian
home. This is an undefiled and imperishable
treasure, which does not become worthless at the
grave, but which will continue to increase in

preciousness as long as the ages of eternity shall
roll on. If through the parent&#8217;s pious agency,
the child comes into possession of this invaluable
blessing, there is given to him more than earthly
treasure, more than pecuniary competency, more
than a good name, or a fair reputation, or a high
social position in this life; he receives a title to
and personal meetness for, the undefiled and imperishable
inheritance of heaven, composed of
glittering crowns of glory, of unspeakable joys,
and sweet communion with all the loved and
cherished there. Thus the fruits of a parent&#8217;s labor
for the salvation of his children constitute an
infinitely more valuable patrimony than all the
accumulated fruits of his industry in behalf of
wealth. All the wealth, and rank, and reputation
which may descend from parent to child, can not
supersede the necessity of a spiritual patrimony.
It is only, as we have seen in a former chapter,
when you minister to the spiritual wants of your
children and tinge all their thoughts and feelings
with a sense of eternity; when your home is made
a spiritual nursery; and you work for their eternal
benefit, and thereby secure for them the fulfillment
of those blessed promises which God has
given concerning the children of believing parents,
that you leave them a patrimony worthy the
Christian home. Such a spiritual patrimony it is
within the power of all Christian parents to bestow.
And without its enjoyment by your children,
you fail to minister unto them as a faithful
steward of God. You may minister to their bodies

and minds; you may amass for them a fortune;
you may give them an education; you may
establish them in the most lucrative business; you
may fit them for an honorable and responsible position;
you may leave them the heritage of social
and political influence; and you may caress them
with all the passionate fondness of the parental
heart and hand; yet, without the heritage of true
piety,&mdash;of the true piety of the parent reproduced,
in the heart and character of the child, all will be
worse than vain, yea, a curse to both the parent
and the children.</p>

<p class="dgp">Having thus briefly pointed out some of the
essential features of the children&#8217;s patrimony,
as physical, intellectual, moral, and spiritual, we
shall now advert to the principles upon which
parents should proceed in the distribution of their
property to their children.</p>

<p class="dgp">They should not give them more than a competency.
That they should lay by something for
them is conceded by all. This is both a right and
a duty. It is included in the obligation to provide
for them; and he who does it not "hath denied
the faith and is worse than an infidel." Natural
affection, as well as supernatural faith, stimulates
the parent to provide thus for his offspring.</p>

<p class="dgp">But this does not demand a great fortune; but
a simple competency, that is, just enough to meet
their immediate wants and emergencies when they
enter the world and begin business-life. This
competence should correspond with the social position
they occupied under the parental roof. It

should not go beyond this; it should be just
enough to meet the social and financial exigencies
of the child. It should be measured also by the
peculiar necessities of the child, by his health,
abilities and circumstances. "A parent is justified,"
says Paley in his Moral and Political Philosophy,
"in making a difference between his
children according as they stand in greater or less
need of the assistance of his fortune, in consequence
of the difference of their age or sex, or of
the situations in which they are placed, or the various
success which they have met with."</p>

<p class="dgp">Now the law of competence does not demand,
yea, it forbids, more than a sufficiency to meet
these peculiar exigencies of the child. Those
parents who seek for more, become parsimonious,
unfaithful to the moral interests of their household,
and indifferent to all legitimate objects of
charity and benevolence. These are indeed but
the necessary fruits of unfaithfulness to this law;
for the course of God&#8217;s providence indicates the
impossibility of our faithfulness to the duty of
Christian beneficence, and at the same time lay
up for our children more than a sufficiency. We
find indeed, that in almost every instance in which
parents have transcended the limits of competence,
and thus raised their children above the necessity
of doing anything themselves for a subsistence,
God has cursed the act, and the canker of His
displeasure has consumed this ill-saved property.
That curse we see often in the prodigality and
dissipation of the children. They walk in the

slippery paths of sin, kneel at the altar of Mammon,
fare sumptuously every day, as prodigal in
spending their fortune as their parents were penurious
in amassing it, until at last they come to
want, rush into crime, and end their unhappy life
in the state&#8217;s prison, or upon the gibbet.</p>

<p class="dgp">We see, therefore, that when parents give their
children more than what they actually need, they
place in their possession the instruments with
which, they ruin themselves. History shows that
the most wealthy men started out in the world
with barely enough, and some, with, nothing;
and that generally those who started with an
independent fortune ended with less than they
started, and many closed their earthly career in
abject poverty and misery. Besides, the man who
made his fortune knows how to keep and expend
it; and in point of happiness derived from property,
"there is no comparison between a fortune
which, a man acquires by well applied industry, or
by a series of success in his business, and one
found in his possession or received from another."
Let, therefore, the property you leave your children
be just enough to meet the exigencies of
their situations, and no more; for</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Wealth hath never given happiness, but often hastened misery;</p>
<p class="l">Enough hath never caused misery, but often quickened happiness;</p>
<p class="l">Enough is less than thy thought, O pampered creature of society,</p>
<p class="l">And he that hath more than enough, is a thief of the rights of his brother!"</p>
</div>



<p class="dgp">Parents should be impartial in the distribution
of their patrimony among their children. They
should never give one more than another unless
for very plausible and Christian reasons, such as
bad health, peculiar circumstances, of want, &amp;c.
They should have no pets, no favorites among
them; and care more for one than for another, or
indulge one more than another. Neither should
they withhold a dowry, from a child as a punishment,
unless his crime and character are of such
an execrable nature as to warrant the assurance
that its bestowment would but enhance his misery.
Then indeed, it would be a blessing to withhold
it. "A child&#8217;s vices may be of that sort,"
says Paley in his Philosophy, "and his vicious
habits so incorrigible, as to afford much the same
reason for believing that he will waste or misemploy
the fortune put into his power, as if he were
mad or idiotish, in which, case a parent may treat
him as a madman, or an idiot; that is, may deem
it sufficient to provide for his support by an annuity
equal to his wants and innocent enjoyments,
and which he may be restrained from alienating.
This seems to be the only case in which a disinherison,
nearly absolute, is justifiable."</p>

<p class="dgp">Neither should parents be capricious in the distribution
of their property among their children.
They have no right to withhold a dowry from
children because they have married against their
will, no more than they have a right, for this reason,
to disown, them. This would be distributing
their property upon the principle of revenge or

reward. No parent has a right to indulge a preference
founded on such an unreasonable and
criminal feeling as revenge. Neither has he a
right to distribute his property from considerations
of age, sex, merit, or situation. The idea
of giving all to the eldest son to perpetuate family
wealth, and distinction; or of giving; all to the
sons, and withholding from the daughters; or of
giving to those children only who were more obsequious
in their adherence to their parent&#8217;s tyrannical
requisitions,&mdash;is unreasonable, unchristian,
and against the generous dictates of natural
affection.</p>

<p class="dgp">From this whole subject we may infer the infatuation
of those parents who toil as the slave
in the galley, to amass a large fortune for their
children. To accomplish this object they become
drudges all their life. They rise early
and retire late, deny themselves even the ordinary
comforts of life, expend all the time and
strength of their manhood, make slaves of their
wives and children, and live retired from all society,
in order to lay up a fortune for their offspring.
To this end they make all things subordinate
and subservient; and, indeed, they so
greatly neglect their children as to deprive them
of even the capacity of enjoying intellectually
or morally the patrimony they thus secure for
them. They bring them up in gross ignorance
of every thing save work: and money. They
teach them close-fisted parsimony, and prepare
them to lead a life as servile and infatuated as

their own. Miserable delusion! "What shall
it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and
lose his own soul?"</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"O cursed lust of gold! when for thy sake</p>
<p class="l">The fool throws up his interest in both worlds;</p>
<p class="l">First starved in this, then damned in that to come!"</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XXV&mdash;The Promises Of The Christian Home.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The promise is unto you, and to your children."</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent" style="text-align: right">ACTS II., 39.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Parent who plantedst in the joy of love,</p>
<p class="l">Yet hast not gather&#8217;d fruit,&mdash;save rankling thorns,</p>
<p class="l">Or Sodom&#8217;s bitter apples,&mdash;hast thou read</p>
<p class="l">Heaven&#8217;s promise to the seeker? Thou may&#8217;st bring</p>
<p class="l">Those o&#8217;er whose cradle thou didst watch with pride,</p>
<p class="l">And lay them at thy Savior&#8217;s feet, for lo!</p>
<p class="l">His shadow falling on the wayward soul,</p>
<p class="l">May give it holy health. And when thou kneel&#8217;st</p>
<p class="l">Low at the pavement of sweet Mercy&#8217;s gate,</p>
<p class="l">Beseeching for thine erring ones, unfold</p>
<p class="l">The passport of the King,&mdash;&#8217;Ask, and receive!</p>
<p class="l">Knock,&mdash;and it shall be opened!"&#8217;</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">The promises of the Christian home may be divided
into two kinds, viz.: Those which God has
given to the family; and those which Christian
parents have made to God.</p>

<p class="dgp">God has not only laid His requisitions upon the
Christian home, but given his promises. Every
command is accompanied with a promise. These
promises give color to all the hopes of home.</p>



<p class="dgp">When the dark cloud of tribulation overhangs
the parent&#8217;s heart; when the overwhelming storm
of misfortune rages around his habitation, uprooting
his hopes and demolishing his interests;
when the ruthless hand of death tears from his
embrace the wife of his bosom and the children
of his love;&mdash;even in hours of bereavement like
these, the promises of God dispel the gloom, and
surround his home and his heart with the sunshine
of peace and joy.</p>

<p class="dgp">His promises extend to both the parents and
their offspring. "Unto you, and unto your children,"
"I will pour my spirit on thy seed, and my
blessing on thine offspring; and they shall spring
up as among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.
One shall say, I am the Lord&#8217;s; and
another shall call himself by the name of Jacob;
and another shall subscribe with his hand unto
the Lord, and surname himself by the name of
Israel." His promises extend to children&#8217;s children;
and whatever they may be for the parent,
they are "visited upon the children unto the third
and fourth generation."</p>

<p class="dgp">Now these divine promises are of two kinds,&mdash;the
promise of punishment, and the promise of
reward. He promises to punish the unfaithful
parent, and to reward the faithful parent. He
also promises to visit both the evil and the good
of the parents upon their children. Such is the
constitution of the family, and such are the vital
relations which the members sustain to each other,
that by the law of natural and moral reproduction,

the child is either blessed or cursed in the
parent. What the parent does will run out in its
legitimate consequences to the child, either as a
malediction or as a benediction.</p>

<p class="dgp">We have divine promises to punish the unfaithful
members of the Christian home. If the parent
becomes guilty of iniquity, it will be visited
upon the children from generation to generation.
There is no consideration which should more effectually
restrain parents from unfaithfulness than
this. Let them become selfish, sensual, indolent,
and dissipated, and soon these elements of iniquity
will be transmitted to their offspring. What the
parent sows, the child will reap. If the former
sow to the flesh, the latter shall of the flesh reap
corruption. Thus, whatsoever the parent sows
in the child he shall reap from the child. The
promised curse of the parent&#8217;s wickedness is deposited
in the child so far as that wickedness affected
the child&#8217;s character. This is all based upon
the great principle that the promises are unto
you, and to your children.</p>

<p class="dgp">But while this great principle is ominous of terror
to the ungodly, it is a pleasing theme to the
pious and faithful. Home is a stewardship; and
if faithful to its high and holy vocation, it has a
good reward for its labor of love. "If ye sow to
the spirit ye shall of the spirit reap life everlasting."
This promise of reward is "to you and to
your children." "Many souls shall be given for
its hire." Their children shall reap the reward of
the faithfulness of the parents. Of them it shall

be said, "this is the seed which the Lord hath
blessed." Faithful parents have thus a glorious
recompense of reward. God shall reward thee
openly. Make your household a true nursery for
the soul; and He will give thee thy wages. The
blessing of the Most High will descend like dew
upon you and your children. And when they
grow up to manhood, He will make them His
agents in rewarding you. They will honor and
comfort you in your declining years. They will
not depart from the ways of the Lord in which
you trained them. Though they may be in a distant
land,&mdash;far from you and the cherished home
of their childhood, yet they will obey your admonitions,
gratefully remember your kindness; and
their grateful obedience and remembrance will be
your great reward from them. They will rise up
and call you blessed.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Though we dwell apart,</p>
<p class="l">Thy loving words are with me evermore,&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Thy precious loving words. Thy hand, and heart.</p>
<p class="l">And earnest soul of love, are here impressed,</p>
<p class="l">For me, a dear memorial through all time.</p>
<p class="l">Mother! I cannot recompense thy love,</p>
<p class="l">But thy reward is sure, for thou hast done</p>
<p class="l">Thy duty perfectly, and we rise up</p>
<p class="l">And call thee blessed; and the Lord shall give</p>
<p class="l">Thy pious cares and labors rich reward."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And when you descend to the grave and are
gathered to your fathers, the assurance of fidelity
to your home-trust, the prospect of meeting your
children in heaven, and all the brilliant hopes that

loom up before you, full of the light and glory of
the eternal world, will furnish you a great recompense
of reward.</p>

<p class="dgp">Parents can rely upon these promises of God
with the full assurance of faith; for His promises
are yea and amen. Let them but lay hold upon
the promises, and act upon the conditions of
their fulfillment, and then leave the rest to God.
Abraham and Joshua, and David, acted upon this
principle in their families. Let the members of
the Christian home do the same, and the blessing
of God will rest upon them.</p>

<p class="dgp">God promises to reward parents in this life.
We find their fulfillment in the peace, the hopes,
the interests, and the pleasures of the faithful
household. The members are happy in each other&#8217;s
love, in each other&#8217;s virtue, in each other&#8217;s
worth, in each other&#8217;s hopes, in each other&#8217;s interests,
in each other&#8217;s confidence, in each other&#8217;s
piety, in each other&#8217;s fidelity, in each other&#8217;s happiness.
Thus God shall reward thee openly. He
has never said to the seed of Jacob seek ye me in
vain. "Verily there is a reward for the righteous."
"This is the seed which the Lord hath
blessed."</p>

<p class="dgp">The promised reward of faithful parents may
be seen in their children. They are in the true
Christian home a precious heritage from the
Lord. Thus a parent&#8217;s faithfulness was rewarded
in the piety of Baxter, and Doddridge, and Watts.
What a rich reward did Elkanah and Hannah receive
by their training up Samuel! And were

not Lois and Eunice rewarded for their faithfulness
to young Timothy? What a glorious reward
the mother of John Q. Adams received from
God, in that great and good man! God blessed
her fidelity, by making him worthy of such a
mother. He himself was conscious that he was
his mother&#8217;s reward, as may be seen from the following
anecdote of him. Governor Briggs of
Massachusetts, after reading with great interest
the letters of John Q. Adam&#8217;s mother, one day
went over to his seat in Congress, and said to him:</p>

<p class="dgp">"Mr. Adams, I have found out who made you!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"What do you mean?" said he.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I have been reading the letters of your mother,"
was the reply.</p>

<p class="dgp">With a flashing eye and glowing face, he started,
and in his peculiar manner, said: "Yes, Briggs,
all that is good in me, I owe to my mother!"</p>

<p class="dgp">But God promises to reward faithful parents
in the life to come. Their great reward is in
heaven. The departure of every pious member
of their home but increases the heavenly reward.
The little child that dies in its mother&#8217;s
arms, and is borne up to the God who gave it,
but increases by its sainted presence there, her
joyful anticipations of the eternal reward.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"And when, by father&#8217;s lonely bed,</p>
<p class="l">You place me in the ground,</p>
<p class="l">And his green turf, with daisies spread,</p>
<p class="l">Has also wrapt me round;</p>
<p class="l">Rejoice to think, to you &#8217;tis given,</p>
<p class="l">To have a ransomed child in heaven!"</p>
</div>



<p class="dgp">And oh, how glorious will be this reward when
all the members shall meet again in heaven, recognize
each other there, and unite their harps and
voices in ascriptions of praise to God. There in
that better home, where no separations take place,
no trials are endured, no sorrows felt, no tears
shed, they shall enjoy the complete fulfillment of
divine promises. Heaven, with its unfading treasures,
with its golden streets, with its crowns of
glory, with its unspeakable joys, with its river of
life, and with its anthems of praise, will be their
great recompense of the reward. How the anticipation
of this should stimulate Christian parents
to increased fidelity; oh, what a happy meeting
will that be, when husband and wife, parent
and child, brother and sister, after many long
years of separation, shall great each other in that
glorious world, and feel that parting grief shall
weep no more!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Oh! when a mother meets on high,</p>
<p class="l">  The child she lost in infancy;</p>
<p class="l">Hath she not then for pains and fears,</p>
<p class="l">  The day of woe, the watchful night,</p>
<p class="l">For all her sorrows, all her tears,</p>
<p class="l">  An over-payment of delight?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With these gracious promises of reward sounding
in their ears, Christian parents should never
despair; neither should they doubt for a moment
the fidelity of God to all his promises. It is true
that His promises are conditional, and their fulfillment
depends upon the parent&#8217;s performance

of his part as the condition, yet to every duty he
has attached a promise; and wherever He has
made a promise for us, he has given us the ability
to use the means of securing its fulfillment; and
as soon as their conditions are thus met, they become
absolute. "Train up a child in the way he
should go." Here is the duty. "And when he
grows old he will not depart from it." Here is
the promise. The condition is, that you discharge
the duty. If you do so, the promise becomes absolute,
and shall with certainty be divinely fulfilled
in your child, though the time and manner
of this fulfillment may not meet your expectations.</p>

<p class="dgp">But some may object to this position, and remind
us that pious parents are known to have
ungodly children who died in their sins. They
may refer us to the case of Absalom, and to the
sons of Eli. In reply we would state that this
is begging the question. It is here taken for
granted that these pious parents did fulfill the
conditions attached to the above promises. This
is a mere assumption; for Absalom was not properly
trained; and both he and the sons of Levi,
were ruined by the misguided fondness and extreme
indulgence of their parents. And thus also
does the foolish partiality of many pious parents
prevent their fidelity to their children. We must
not think that all pious parents are faithful to
their duty to their children. The above objection,
however, assumes this ground; and, therefore,
it is not valid. It is often said that the children
of ministers and pious parents are usually more

wicked than other children. This is false. The
opposite is true. We admit, some have bad children;
but it is the fault of the parents; not because
God does not fulfill His covenant promises
to His people. His people, in these instances, do
not meet the conditions upon which His promises
are made absolute.</p>

<p class="dgp">We must not suppose that because a divine
promise exists detached from expressed conditions,
it will be fulfilled without the use of means.
There is a manifest compatibility between the absolute
promises of God and the use of the means
in our power for their fulfillment. The promise
to Paul in the ship in which he was conveyed to
Rome, that none of the passengers should perish,
was not incompatible with Paul&#8217;s declaration,
"except these persons abide in the ship, ye cannot
be saved." Neither were the efforts of the
mother of Moses to save him, incompatible with
the absolute promise of God that "this babe shall
be saved, and be the deliverer of Israel." What
she did to preserve his life was accompanied with
an active, confiding faith in the divine promise
concerning him. And thus should faith in God&#8217;s
promises stimulate Christian parents to zealous
activity in the use of all those means which secure
their fulfillment.</p>

<p class="dgp">The Christian home should ever keep in lively
remembrance the solemn promises made by her
to God. In marriage, in holy baptism, she has
made vows unto God, and he says to her, pay
thy vows. "When thou shalt vow a vow unto

the Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it;
for the Lord thy God will surely require it of
thee." These parental promises made to God regard
themselves and their children; and their
faithful fulfillment brings them within the glorious
promise which God gave to Abraham; for,
says Paul, "If ye be Christ&#8217;s, then are ye Abraham&#8217;s
seed, and heirs according to the promise:"
Gal. iii., 29.</p>

<p class="dgp">Christian parents: the promises of God shine
forth as brilliantly now as over they did upon the
pages of sacred history. They are as bright for
you as they were for Abraham and Joshua, when
they trembled in sublime eloquence upon the lips
of God. Let them, therefore, be not in vain.
The promises are unto you, and to your children.
And you in turn have promised God that
you would bless your household, and be faithful
to your children. Hold, fast to these promises
without wavering. Hang all your hopes upon
them. Cling to them with the wrestling spirit of
Jacob. And remember that you cannot shake
off your vows and promises made to God. He
will sorely require it of thee. Therefore pay
thy vows unto the Lord. God will reward you
for so doing. "The mountains shall depart, and
the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not
depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of
my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath
mercy on thee:" Isaiah liv., 10.</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XXVI&mdash;The Bereavements Of The Christian Home.<a href="#note_1"><span class="footnoteref">1</span></a></h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "On, long ago</p>
<p class="l">Those blessed days departed, we are reft,</p>
<p class="l">And scattered like the leaves of some fair rose,</p>
<p class="l">That fall off one by one upon the breeze,</p>
<p class="l">Which bears them where it listeth. Never more</p>
<p class="l">Can they be gathered and become a rose.</p>
<p class="l">And we can be united never more</p>
<p class="l">A family on earth!"</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Bereavement involves the providential discipline
of home. In almost every household there
have been sorrows and tears as well as joys and
hopes. As the Christian home is the depository
of the highest interests and the purest pleasures,
so it is the scene of sad bereavements and of the
darkest trials. It may become as desolate as the

home of Job. The Christian may, like the aged
tree, be stripped of his clusters, his branches, all
his summer glory, and sink down into a lonely
and dreary existence. His home, which once
rang with glad voices, may become silent and
sad and hopeless. Those hearts which once
beat with life and love, may become still and
cold; and all the earthly interests which clustered
around his fireside may pass away like the
dream of an hour!</p>

<p class="dgp">The members of home must separate. Theirs
is but a probationary state. Their household is
but a tent,&mdash;a tabernacle in the flesh, and all that
it contains will pass away. The fondest ties will
be broken; the brightest hopes will fade; all its
joys are transient; its interests meteoric, and the
fireside of cheerfulness will ere long become the
scene of despondency. Every swing of the pendulum
of the clock tells that the time of its probation
is becoming shorter and shorter, and that
its members are approaching nearer and nearer
the period of their separation.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"There is no union here of hearts,</p>
<p class="l">That finds not here an end."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Alas! how soon this takes place! The joy of
home would be perfect did not the thought of a
speedy separation intrude. No sooner than the
voice of childhood is changed, than separation
begins to take place. Some separate for another
world; some are borne by the winds and waves

to distant lands; others enter the deep forests of
the West, and are heard of no more;&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Alas! the brother knows not now where fall the sister&#8217;s tears!</p>
<p class="l">One haply revels at the feast, while one may droop alone;</p>
<p class="l">For broken is the household chain,&mdash;the bright fire quenched and gone!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What melancholy feelings are awakened within
at the sight of a deserted home, in which loved
ones once met and lived and loved; but from
which they have now wandered, each in the path
pointed out by the guiding hand of Providence.
How beautifully does Mrs. Hemans portray this
separation in the following admirable lines!&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"They grew in beauty side by side,</p>
<p class="l">  They filled one home with glee;</p>
<p class="l">Their graves are severed, far and wide,</p>
<p class="l">  By mount, and stream, and sea.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The same fond mother bent at night</p>
<p class="l">  O&#8217;er each fair sleeping brow;</p>
<p class="l">She had each folded flower in sight&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">  Where are those dreamers now?</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"One midst the forests of the West</p>
<p class="l">  By a dark stream is laid;</p>
<p class="l">The Indian knows his place of rest</p>
<p class="l">  Far in the cedar shade.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The sea, the blue lone sea, hath one,</p>
<p class="l">  He lies where pearls lie deep;</p>
<p class="l">He was the loved of all, yet none</p>
<p class="l">  O&#8217;er his low bed may weep.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"One sleeps where southern vines are dress&#8217;d,</p>
<p class="l">  Above the noble slain;</p>
<p class="l">He wrapped his colors round his breast,</p>
<p class="l">  On a blood-red field of Spain.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"And one&mdash;o&#8217;er her the myrtle showers,</p>
<p class="l">  Its leaves by soft winds fanned;</p>
<p class="l">She faded midst Italian flowers&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">  The last of that fair band.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"And parted thus, they rest, who played</p>
<p class="l">  Beneath the same green tree;</p>
<p class="l">Whose voices mingled as they prayed</p>
<p class="l">  Around one parent knee!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is thus in almost every household. The members
may be divided into two classes,&mdash;the present
and the absent ones. Who may not say of
his family&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "We are not all here!</p>
<p class="l">Some are away&mdash;the dead ones dear,</p>
<p class="l">Who thronged with us this ancient hearth,</p>
<p class="l">And gave the hour of guiltless mirth.</p>
<p class="l">Fate, with a stern, relentless hand,</p>
<p class="l">Looked in and thinned our little band.</p>
<p class="l">Some like a night-flash passed away,</p>
<p class="l">And some sank lingering day by day,</p>
<p class="l">The quiet graveyard&mdash;some lie there,&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">  We&#8217;re not all here!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The bereavements of home are diversified. The
reverses of fortune constitute an important class
of family afflictions, causing the habits, customs,
social privileges and advantages of home to be

broken up and changed. Many a family, which,
in former days, enjoyed all the pleasures and privileges
of wealth and social distinction, have now
to struggle with cruel poverty, and receive from
the world, scorn and ridicule and dishonor.</p>

<p class="dgp">But the greatest bereavement of home is, generally,
death. They only, who have lived in the
house of mourning, know what the sad bereavements
are which death produces, and what deep
and dark vacancies this last enemy leaves in the
stricken heart of home.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The lips that used to bless you there,</p>
<p class="l">Are silent with the dead."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To-day we may visit the family. What a lovely
scene it presents! The members are happy in
each other&#8217;s love, and each one resting his hopes
upon all the rest. No cares perplex them; no
sorrows corrode them; no trials distress them;
no darkness overshadows them! What tender
bonds unite them; what hopes cluster around
each heart; what a depth of reciprocated affection
we find in each bosom; and by what tender
sympathy they are drawn to each other!</p>

<p class="dgp">But alas! in an hour of supposed security, that
loving group is broken up by the intrusion of
death, and some one or more carried from the
bosom of love to the cold and cheerless grave.
The curfew-bell speaks the solemn truth, and
warns the members that "in the midst of life
they are in death." Where is the home that
has not some memorial of departed ones,&mdash;a

chair empty, a vacant seat at the table,&mdash;garments
laid by,&mdash;ashes of the dead treasured up
in the urn of memory! What sudden ravages
does this ruthless foe of life, often make in the
family! The members are often taken away, one
by one in quick succession, until all of them are
laid, side by side beneath the green sod.</p>

<p class="dgp">What a memorable epoch in the history of
home is that, in which death finds his first entrance
within its sacred enclosures, and with ruthless
hand breaks the first link of a golden chain
that creates its identity! We can never forget
that event. It may he the first-born in the radiant
beauty of youth, or the babe in the first
bursting of life&#8217;s budding loveliness, or a father
in the midst of his anxious cares, or the mother
who gave light and happiness to all around
her. Whoever it is, the first death makes a
breach there which no subsequent bereavement
can equal; new feelings are then awakened; a
new order of associations is then commenced;
hopes and fears are then aroused that never subside;
and the mysterious web of family life receives
the hue of a new and darker thread.</p>

<p class="dgp">What a sad bereavement is the death of the
husband and father! Children! there is the
grave of your father! You have recently heard
the clods of the valley groan upon his coffin.
The parent stem from which, you grew and to
which, you fondly clung, has been shattered by
the lightning-stroke of death, and its terrible
shock is now felt in every fiber of the wrenched

and torn branches. Yours is now a widowed
and an orphaned home. The disconsolate members
are left helpless and hopeless in the world;
the widowed mother sits by the dying embers of
her lonely cottage, overwhelmed with grief, and
poor in everything but her children and her God.
These orphans are turned out upon the cold charities
of an unfriendly world, neglected and forlorn,
having no one to care for them but a poor, broken-hearted
mother, whose deathless faith points them
to the bright spirit-world to which their sainted
father has gone, where parting grief shall weep
no more.</p>

<p class="dgp">But a greater bereavement even than this, is,
the death of a wife and mother. Ah! here is a
bereavement which the child alone can fully feel.
When the mother is laid upon the cold bier, and
sleeps among the dead, the center of home-love
and attraction is gone. What children are more
desolate and more to be pitied than the motherless
ones? She, who fed them from her gentle breast
and sung sweet lullaby to soothe them into sleep,&mdash;she,
who taught them to kneel in prayer at her
side, and ministered to all their little wants, and
sympathized with them in all their little troubles,&mdash;she
has now been torn from them, leaving them
a smitten flock indeed, and the light of her smile
will never again be round their beds and paths.
As the shades of night close in upon that smitten
home, and the chime of the bell tells the hour in
which the mother used to gather them around her
for prayer, and sing them to their rosy rest, with

what a stricken heart does the bereaved husband
seek to perform this office of love in her stead;
and as he gathers them for the first time around
him, how fully does he feel that none can take a
mother&#8217;s place!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"My sheltering arms can clasp you all,</p>
<p class="l">  My poor deserted throng;</p>
<p class="l">Cling as you used to cling to her</p>
<p class="l">  Who sings the angel&#8217;s song.</p>
<p class="l">Begin, sweet ones, the accustomed strain,</p>
<p class="l">  Come, warble loud and clear;</p>
<p class="l">Alas, alas! you&#8217;re weeping all,</p>
<p class="l">  You&#8217;re sobbing in my ear;</p>
<p class="l">Good night; go, say the prayer she taught,</p>
<p class="l">  Beside your little bed.</p>
<p class="l">The lips that used to bless you there,</p>
<p class="l">  Are silent with the dead.</p>
<p class="l">A father&#8217;s hand your course may guide</p>
<p class="l">  Amid the storms of life,</p>
<p class="l">His care protect those shrinking plants</p>
<p class="l">  That dread the storm of strife;</p>
<p class="l">But who, upon your infant hearts,</p>
<p class="l">  Shall like that mother write?</p>
<p class="l">Who touch the strings that rule the soul?</p>
<p class="l">  Dear smitten flock, good night!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Who can forget a mother, or lose those impressions
which her death made upon our deeply
stricken hearts? None,&mdash;not even the wretch
who has brutalized all the feelings of natural
affection. The memory of a mother&#8217;s death is
as fadeless as the deep impress of a mother&#8217;s
love upon our hearts. As often as we resort

to her grave we must leave behind the tribute
of our tears. Who can read the following beautiful
lines of Cowper, and&mdash;if the memory of a
sainted mother is awakened by them,&mdash;not weep?</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"My mother! When I learned that thou wast dead,</p>
<p class="l">Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?</p>
<p class="l">Hovered thy spirit o&#8217;er thy sorrowing son,</p>
<p class="l">Wretch even then, life&#8217;s journey just begun!</p>
<p class="l">Perhaps thou gay&#8217;st me, though unfelt, a kiss;</p>
<p class="l">Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Ah, that maternal smile! it answers&mdash;yes!</p>
<p class="l">I heard the bell toll on the burial day,</p>
<p class="l">I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away,</p>
<p class="l">And, turning from my nurs&#8217;ry window, drew</p>
<p class="l">A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!</p>
<p class="l">But was it such? It was. Where thou art gone.</p>
<p class="l">Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown.</p>
<p class="l">May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore,</p>
<p class="l">The parting word shall pass my lips no more!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The death of children is a great bereavement
of home. Behold that little blossom withered in
its mother&#8217;s arms! See those tears which flood
her eyes as she bends in her deep grief over the
grave of her cherished babe! Go, fond parents,
to that little mound, and weep! It is well to
do so; it is well for thee in the twilight hour
to steal around that hallowed spot, and pay the
tribute of memory to your little one, in flooding
tears. There beneath those blooming flowers
which the hand of affection planted, it sweetly
sleeps. It bids adieu to all the scenes and cares
of life. It just began to taste the cup of life, and

turned from its ingredients of commingled joy
and sorrow, to a more peaceful clime. Cold
now is that little heart which once beat its
warm pulses so near to thine; hushed is now
that sweet voice that once breathed music to
your soul. Like the folding up of the rose, it
passed away; that beautiful bud which bloomed
and cheered your heart, was transplanted ere the
storm beat upon it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Death found strange beauty on that polished brow,</p>
<p class="l">And dashed it out&mdash;</p>
<p class="l"><span style="color: white">And dashed it out&mdash; </span>There was a tint of rose</p>
<p class="l">On cheek and lip. He touched the veins with ice,</p>
<p class="l">And the rose faded.</p>
<p class="l"><span style="color: white">And the rose faded. </span>Forth from those blue eyes</p>
<p class="l">There spake a wishful tenderness, a doubt</p>
<p class="l">Whether to grieve or sleep, which innocence</p>
<p class="l">Alone may wear. With ruthless haste he bound</p>
<p class="l">The silken fringes of those curtained lids</p>
<p class="l">Forever.</p>
<p class="l"><span style="color: white">Forever. </span>There had been a murmuring sound,</p>
<p class="l">With which the babe would claim its mother&#8217;s ear,</p>
<p class="l">Charming her even to tears. The spoiler set</p>
<p class="l">His seal of silence.</p>
<p class="l"><span style="color: white">His seal of silence. </span>But there beamed a smile</p>
<p class="l">So fixed, so holy, from that cherub brow,</p>
<p class="l">Death gazed&mdash;and left it there.</p>
<p class="l"><span style="color: white">Death gazed&mdash;and left it there. </span>He dared not steal</p>
<p class="l">The signet-ring of heaven!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The death of such an infant is indeed a sore
affliction, and causes the bleeding heart of the parent
to cry out, "Whose sorrow is like unto my

sorrow!" Unfeeling Death! that thou shouldst
thus blight the fair flowers and nip the unfolding
buds of promise in the Christian home!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Death! thou dread looser of the dearest tie,</p>
<p class="l">Was there no aged and no sick one nigh?</p>
<p class="l">No languid wretch who long&#8217;d, but long&#8217;d in vain,</p>
<p class="l">For thy cold hand to cool his fiery pain?</p>
<p class="l">And was the only victim thou couldst find,</p>
<p class="l">An infant in its mother&#8217;s arms reclined?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus it is that death often turns from the sickly
to the healthy, from the decrepitude of age to
the strong man in his prime, from the miserable
wretch who longs for the grave to the smiling
babe upon its mother&#8217;s breast, and there in those
"azure veins which steal like streams along a
field of snow," he pours his putrefying breath,
and leaves within that mother&#8217;s arms nothing but
loathsomeness and ruin! It was thus, bereaved
parents, that he came within your peaceful home,
and threw a cruel mockery over all your visions
of delight, over all the joys and hopes and interests
of your fireside, personifying their wreck in
the cold and ghastly corpse of your child. All
that is now left to you is, the memorials around
you that once the pride of your heart was there;&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The nursery shows thy pictured wall,</p>
<p class="l">  Thy bat, thy bow,</p>
<p class="l">Thy cloak and bonnet, club and ball,</p>
<p class="l">  But where art thou?</p>
<p class="l">A corner holds thine empty chair,</p>
<p class="l">Thy playthings idly scattered there,</p>
<p class="l">But speak to us of our despair!"</p>
</div>



<p class="dgp">How sad and lonely especially is the mother
who is called thus to weep the loss of her departed
infant. Oh, it is hard for her to give up
that loved one whose smile and childish glee were
the light and the hope of her heart. As she lays
it in the cold, damp earth, and returns to her
house of mourning, and there contemplates its
empty cradle, and that silent nursery, once gladsome
with its mirth, she feels the sinking weight
of her desolation. No light, no luxury, no friend,
can fill the place of her lost one.</p>

<p class="dgp">And especially if this lost one be the first-born,&mdash;the
first bud of promise and of hope, how doubly
painful is the bereavement. It makes our home
as dark and desolate as was the hour when Abraham
with uplifted knife, was about to send death
to the throbbing heart of his beloved Isaac. Nothing
can supply the place of a first-born child; and
home can never be what it was when the sweet
voice of that first-born child was heard. The
first green leaf of that household has faded; and
though leaves may put forth, and other buds of
promise may unfold, and bright faces may light
up the home-hearth, and the sunshine of hope
may play around the heart; but&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"They never can replace the bud our early fondness nurst,</p>
<p class="l">They may be lovely and beloved, but not like thee&mdash;the first!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Your heart continues lonely and desolate; its
strings are broken; its tenderest fibers wrenched;
you continue to steal "beneath, the church-yard
tree, where the grass grows green and wild," and

there weep over the grave of your first maternal
love; and like Rachael, refuse to be comforted
because he is not. Your grief is natural, and
only those who have lost their first-born can
fully realize it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Young mother! what can feeble friendship say,</p>
<p class="l">To soothe the anguish of this mournful day?</p>
<p class="l">They, they alone, whose hearts like thine have bled,</p>
<p class="l">Know how the living sorrow for the dead;</p>
<p class="l">I&#8217;ve felt it all,&mdash;alas! too well I know</p>
<p class="l">How vain all earthly power to hush thy woe!</p>
<p class="l">God cheer thee, childless mother! &#8217;tis not given</p>
<p class="l">For man to ward the blow that falls from heaven.</p>
<p class="l">I&#8217;ve felt it all&mdash;as thou art feeling now;</p>
<p class="l">Like thee, with stricken heart and aching brow,</p>
<p class="l">I&#8217;ve sat and watched by dying beauty&#8217;s bed,</p>
<p class="l">And burning tears of hopeless anguish shed;</p>
<p class="l">I&#8217;ve gazed upon the sweet, but pallid face,</p>
<p class="l">And vainly tried some comfort there to trace;</p>
<p class="l">I&#8217;ve listened to the short and struggling breath;</p>
<p class="l">I&#8217;ve seen the cherub eye grow dim in death;</p>
<p class="l">Like thee, I&#8217;ve veiled my head in speechless gloom,</p>
<p class="l">And laid my first-born in the silent tomb!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Now in all these bereavements of the Christian
home we have developed the wisdom and goodness
of God; and the consideration of this we commend
to the bereaved as a great comfort. They
are but the execution of God&#8217;s merciful design
concerning the family. Pious parents can, therefore,
bless the Lord for these afflictions. It is
often well for both you and your children that bereavements

come. They come often as the ministers
of grace. The tendency of home is to confine
its supreme affections within itself, and not
yield them unto God. Parents often bestow upon
their children all their love, and live for them
alone. Then God lays his rod upon them, takes
their loved ones to his own arms, to show them
the folly of using them as abusing them. If home
had no such bereavements, eternity would be lost
sight of; God would not be obeyed; souls would
be neglected; natural affection would crush the
higher incentives and restraints of faith; earthly
interests would push from our hearts all spiritual
concerns; and our tent-home in this vale of tears
would be substituted for our heavenly home. We
see, therefore, the benevolent wisdom of God in
ordaining bereavements to arrest us from the control
of unsanctified natural affection. When we
see the flowers of our household withered and
strewn around us; when that which we most
tenderly loved and clung to, is taken from us in
an unexpected hour, we begin to see the futility
of living for earthly interests alone; and we turn
from the lamented dead to be more faithful to the
cherished and dependent living.</p>

<p class="dgp">Let us, therefore, remember that in all our afflictions
God has some merciful design, the execution
of which will contribute to the temporal and eternal
welfare of our home. He designs either to
correct us if we do wrong, or to prevent us from
doing wrong, or to test our Christian fidelity, or to
instruct us in the deep mysteries and meandering

ways of human life, and keep before us the true
idea of our homes and lives as a pilgrimage.
Nothing, save supernatural agencies, so effectually
removes the moral film from our intellectual
eye as the hand of bereavement. Death is a great
teacher. Sources of pensive reflection and spiritual
communion are opened, which none but death
could unseal. A proper sense of the spirit-world
is developed; life appears in its naked reality;
heaven gains new attractions; eternity becomes a
holier theme,&mdash;a more cheerful object of thought;
the true relation of this to the life to come, is
realized; and the presence of the world of the
unseen enters more deeply into our moral consciousness.</p>

<p class="dgp">Though our loved ones are gone, they are still
with us in spirit; yea, they are ours still, in the
best sense of possession; our relationship with
them is not destroyed, but hallowed. Though
absent, they still live and love; and they come
thronging as ministering spirits to our hearts;
they hover near us, and commune with us.
Though death may separate us from them, it
does not disunite us. Your departed children,
though separated from you in body, are still
yours, are with you in spirit, and are members
of your family. They represent your household
in heaven, and are a promise that you will be
there also. You are still their parents; you are
still one family,&mdash;one in spirit, in faith, in hope,
in promise, in Christ. You still dwell together
in the fond memories of home, and in the bright

anticipation of a coming reunion in heaven. Oh,
with this view of death and with this hope of
joining love&#8217;s buried ones again, you can gather
those that yet remain, and talk to them of those
you put, cold and speechless, in their bed of clay;
and while their bodies lie exposed to the winter&#8217;s
storm or to the summer&#8217;s heat, you can point the
living to that cheering promise which spans, as
with an areole of glory, the graves of buried love;
you can tell them they shall meet their departed
kindred in a better home. Oh, clasp this promise
to your aching heart; treasure it up as a pearl of
great price. Your departed children are not lost
to you; and their death to them is great gain.
They are not lost, but only sent before. "The
Lord, has taken them away." With these views
of death before you, and with the moral instructions
they afford, you cannot but feel that your
children, though absent from you in body, are with
you in spirit,&mdash;are still living with you in your
household, and are among that spirit-throng which
ever press around you, to bear you up lest you
dash your foot against a stone. Such were the
feelings of the Christian father, as expressed in
the following touching lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "I cannot make him dead!</p>
<p class="l">  When passing by his bed,</p>
<p class="l">So long watched over with parental care,</p>
<p class="l">  My spirit and my eye</p>
<p class="l">  Seek it inquiringly,</p>
<p class="l">Before the thought comes that&mdash;he is not there!</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "When at the day&#8217;s calm close</p>
<p class="l">  Before we seek repose,</p>
<p class="l">I&#8217;m with his mother, offering up our prayer,</p>
<p class="l">  Whate&#8217;er I may be saying,</p>
<p class="l">  I am, in spirit, praying</p>
<p class="l">For our boy&#8217;s spirit, though&mdash;he is not there!</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Not there? Where, then, is he?</p>
<p class="l">  The form I used to see</p>
<p class="l">Was but the raiment that he used to wear.</p>
<p class="l">  The grave, that now doth press</p>
<p class="l">  Upon that cast-off dress,</p>
<p class="l">Is but his wardrobe locked;&mdash;he is not there!</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "He lives! In all the past</p>
<p class="l">  He lives; nor, to the last,</p>
<p class="l">Of seeing him again will I despair;</p>
<p class="l">  In dreams I see him now,</p>
<p class="l">  And on his angel brow,</p>
<p class="l">I see it written, &#8217;Thou shalt see me there!&#8217;</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Yes, we all live to God!</p>
<p class="l">  Father, thy chastening rod</p>
<p class="l">So help us, thine afflicted ones, to bear,</p>
<p class="l">  That in the spirit-land,</p>
<p class="l">  Meeting at thy right hand,</p>
<p class="l">&#8217;Twill he our heaven to find that&mdash;he is there!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">From this view of the educational principle
involved in all our bereavements, we may easily
infer that God designs to benefit us by them.
There is an actual usefulness in all the bereavements
of the Christian home. They are but the
discipline of a Father&#8217;s hand and the ministration
of a Father&#8217;s love. Though His face may wear a

dark frown, or be hid behind the tempest-cloud,
and His rod may be laid heavily upon you, yet
you are not warranted to believe that no sweet is
in the bitter cup you drink, that no light shines
behind the cloud, or that no good dwells in the
bursting storm around you. The present may
indeed he dark; but the future will be bright and
laden with a Father&#8217;s blessing. The smile will
succeed the frown; the balm will follow the rod.
The good seed will be sown after the deep furrows
are made. "No chastening for the present
seemeth joyous, but grievous, yet it worketh out a
far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory to
them that are exercised thereby." The memory
that lingers around the grave of our loved ones,
is sad and tearful. The stricken heart heaves
with emotions too big for utterance, when we hear
no more the sound of their accustomed footsteps
upon the threshold of our door. Oh, the cup of
bereavement is then bitter, its hour dark, and the
pall of desolation hangs heavily around our hearts
and homes.</p>

<p class="dgp">But this is only the dark side of bereavement.
The eye which then weeps may fail at the time
to behold through its tears, the quickening, softening,
subduing and resuscitating power which
dwells in the clouds of darkness and of storm;
and the heart, wounded and bleeding, too often
fails to realize the light and glory which loom up
from the grave. But when we look upon the
cold, pale face of the dead, in the light of a hopeful
resurrection; when their silent forms move in

the light of those saving influences which have
been exerted upon us, we learn the necessity of
bereavement; the mournful cypress will become
more beautiful than the palm tree, and in view of
its saving power over us, we can say, "it is good
for us that we have been afflicted!"</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The path of sorrow, and that path alone,</p>
<p class="l">Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown.</p>
<p class="l">No traveler e&#8217;er reached that blest abode,</p>
<p class="l">Who found not thorns and briers in his road.</p>
<p class="l">For He who knew what human hearts would prove,</p>
<p class="l">How slow to learn the dictates of His love;</p>
<p class="l">That, hard by nature and of stubborn will,</p>
<p class="l">A life of ease would make them, harder still;</p>
<p class="l">Called for a cloud to darken all their years,</p>
<p class="l">And said, &#8217;Go, spend them in the vale of tears!&#8217;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Who will not admit that it is an act of real
kindness for God to remove little children from
this world, and at once take them as His own in
heaven? This is surely an act of His mercy, and
for their benefit. It arrests them from the perils
and tribulations of mature life; it makes their
pilgrimage through this vale of tears, of short
duration; they escape thereby the bitter cup of
actual sin, and the mental and moral agonies of
death. It is well with them. How true are the
following beautiful verses on the death of children,
from the pen of John. Q. Adams:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Sure, to the mansions of the blest</p>
<p class="l">When infant innocence ascends,</p>
<p class="l">Some angel brighter than the rest</p>
<p class="l">The spotless spirit&#8217;s flight attends.</p>

<p class="l">On wings of ecstasy they rise,</p>
<p class="l">  Beyond where worlds material roll,</p>
<p class="l">Till some fair sister of the skies,</p>
<p class="l">  Receives the unpolluted soul.</p>
<p class="l">There at the Almighty Father&#8217;s hand,</p>
<p class="l">  Nearest the throne of living light,</p>
<p class="l">The choirs of infant seraphs stand,</p>
<p class="l">  And dazzling shine, where all are bright!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Christ became a little child, that little children
might receive the crown of their age and
be eternally saved. He took them in His arms,
blessed them, and said, "of such is the kingdom
of heaven." And we are told that "out of the
mouths of babes and sucklings He has ordained
strength." The sweetest hosannas before His
throne, doubtless proceed from cherub-lips, and
they glow nearest to the bright vision of the face
of unveiled glory.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Calm on the bosom of thy God,</p>
<p class="l">  Young spirits! rest thee now!</p>
<p class="l">Even while with us thy footsteps trod,</p>
<p class="l">  His seal was on thy brow."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">They stand before the throne in white robes, with
palms in their hands, and crowns of glory on their
heads, crying-out, "Salvation to our God, which
sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb!"
Tell me, does not this view dilate the parent&#8217;s
heart, and make him thankful that he has a sainted
child in heaven? Weep for those you have
with you, who live under the shades of a moral
death, who have entered upon a thorny pilgrimage,

and are exposed to the ravages of sin; oh,
weep for them!&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"But never be a tear-drop given</p>
<p class="l">To those that rest in yon blue heaven."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The sainted dead of your home are more blessed
than the pilgrim living. Weep not, then, that
they are gone. Their early departure was to them
great gain. Had they been spared to grow up to
manhood, you then might have to take up the
lamentation of David, "Would to God I had
died for thee!" While they, in the culprit&#8217;s
cell, or on the dying couch of the hopeless impenitent,
would respond to you in tones of deepening
woe,&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Would I had died when young!</p>
<p class="l">How many burning tears,</p>
<p class="l">And wasted hopes and severed ties,</p>
<p class="l">Had spared my after years!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Would you, then, to gratify a parent&#8217;s heart, awake
that little slumberer from its peaceful repose, and
recall its happy spirit from its realms of glory?
There the light of heaven irradiates it; its visions
are unclouded there; and from those battlements
of uncreated glory it comes to thee on errands of
love and mercy. Would you, now, that this inhabitant
of heaven should be degraded to earth
again? Would you remove him from those rivers
of delight to this dry and thirsty land? Would
not this be cruel?</p>



<p class="dgp">When, therefore, your babe is taken from you,
regard it as a kind deed of your heavenly Father,
and say, "even so it seemeth good in thy
sight:"</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Pour not the voice of woe!</p>
<p class="l">  Shed not a burning tear</p>
<p class="l">When spirits from the cold earth go,</p>
<p class="l">  Too bright to linger here!</p>
<p class="l">Unsullied let them pass</p>
<p class="l">  Into oblivion&#8217;s tomb&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Like snow-flakes melting in the sea</p>
<p class="l">  When ripe with vestal bloom.</p>
<p class="l">Then strew fresh flowers above the grave,</p>
<p class="l">  And let the tall grass o&#8217;er it wave."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the death of little children is a great mercy,
not only to themselves, but also to the living.
Those that remain behind are greatly benefited
thereby. It exerts a sanctifying, elevating and alluring
influence over them. As they pass in their
bright pathway to heaven, they leave a blessing behind.
God takes them in goodness to us. The
interests of the parents are not different from, or
opposed to, those of their offspring. The happiness
of the latter is that of the former. If, therefore,
their death is their blessing, it must be the
parent&#8217;s blessing also. "If love," says Baxter,
"teaches us to mourn with them that mourn, and
rejoice with them that rejoice, then can we mourn
for those of our children that are possessed of the
highest everlasting happiness?"</p>

<p class="dgp">It is true, their sweet faces, unfurrowed by guilt

or shame, we shall never more gaze upon; the
sound of their happy lullaby we shall never again
hear. They are gone now to the spirit-land. But
a parent&#8217;s care and solicitude are also gone. All
alarm for their safety is gone; and you now rejoice
in the assurance that they have gone to a
higher and happier home; and can joyfully exclaim
now with Leigh Richmond, "My child is a
saint in glory!" His infant powers, so speedily
paralyzed by the ruthless hand of death, are now
expanding themselves amidst the untold glories
of the heavenly world, and are enlisted now in
ministering to his pilgrim kindred on earth.</p>

<p class="dgp">It is true, your children were a source of great
joy to you here. Insensibly did they entwine
themselves around your heart, and with all the
wild ecstasy of maternal love, you embraced
them, as they attached themselves, like the slender
vine, to you. They were indeed, the life and
light of your home, and the deepest joy of your
heart. But if they had lived, might they not also
have been a source of the deepest sorrow and
misery? Might they not have drawn your souls
from God and heaven, causing you to live alone
for them, and bringing eventually your gray hairs
down with sorrow to the grave?</p>

<p class="dgp">But you have watched at their dying couch,
and seen them die; and in that death you have
also seen the departure of all such fears and dangers.
They are now transplanted to a more congenial
clime, where they will bloom forever in
unfading loveliness, and from which they will

come on errands of ministering love to your
household:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"They come, on the wings of the morning they come,</p>
<p class="l">Impatient to lead some poor wanderer home;</p>
<p class="l">Some pilgrim to snatch from his stormy abode,</p>
<p class="l">And lay him to rest in the arms of his God!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">One of the greatest blessings which the death of
our pious kindred confers upon their bereaved
friends is, that they hold a saving communion with
them, and are ministering spirits sent to minister
salvation and consolation unto them.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The saints on earth, and all the dead,</p>
<p class="l">But one communion make."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">They constitute our guardian angels; they witness
our Christian race; they commune with our
spirits; they link us to the spirit-world; they impress
us with its deep mysteries; they stimulate
our religious life, and bear us up lest we dash our
feet against the pebble which lies in our pathway
to the mansions of the blest. The mother who
bends in the deep anguish of her soul, over the
little grave in which her infant slumbers, has in
heaven a cherub spirit to minister to her. And
oh, could the veil which wraps the spirit-world
from our view, be now removed, and we permitted
to catch a glimpse of the heavenly scene there
displayed, we should doubtless behold on the
threshold of that better home, an innumerable

host witnessing with, intensity of interest, the
scenes of human life; and no doubt to you, bereaved
friend, the most conspicuous among that
celestial throng, would be the sainted form of
that dear one whose grave you often adorn with
the warm tribute of memory&#8217;s gushing tears.
And oh, could you understand the relation in
which that sainted one stands to you, you would
doubtless be conscious that over and about you it
hovers from day to day as your guardian spirit,
watching all the details of your life, soothing the
anguish of your troubled heart, and ministering
unto you in holy things!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The spirits of the loved and departed</p>
<p class="l">  Are with us; and they tell us of the sky,</p>
<p class="l">A rest for the bereaved and broken-hearted,</p>
<p class="l">  A house not made with hands, a home on high!</p>
<p class="l">They have gone from us, and the grave is strong!</p>
<p class="l">  Yet in night&#8217;s silent watches they are near;</p>
<p class="l">Their voices linger round us, as the song</p>
<p class="l">Of the sweet skylark lingers on the ear."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The whole dispensation of grace is like the ladder
set up on earth, whose top reached heaven,
and upon which Jacob saw the angels ascending;
and descending. As the Christian pilgrim in his
spiritual progression mounts each round of this
ladder, he finds himself in the midst of a spirit-throng
ascending and descending on errands of
love and mercy to him; yea, the canopy of the
sky seems lined with so great a cloud, of witnesses
and ministering spirits; and among them we behold

our sainted friends bidding us climb on to
their lofty abodes; they beckon us to themselves;
their voices animate us, as they steal down upon
our spirits in solemn and beautiful cadence.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Hark! heard ye not a sound</p>
<p class="l">Sweeter than wild-bird&#8217;s note, or minstrel&#8217;s lay!</p>

<p class="l">  I hear it echoing round.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "It is the tuneful chime</p>
<p class="l">Of spirit-voices!&mdash;&#8217;tis my infant band</p>

<p class="l">  To joy&#8217;s unclouded clime.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "My beautiful, my blest!</p>
<p class="l">I see them there, by the great Spirit&#8217;s throne;</p>
<p class="l">With winning words, and fond beseeching tone,</p>
<p class="l">  They woo me to my rest!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Weeping mother! that little babe, whose spirit
has been borne by angels to heaven, where it now
glows in visions of loveliness around God&#8217;s throne,
comes often as a ministering spirit to thee, whispers
peace and hope to thy disconsolate heart, and
with its tiny hands bears thee up in thy dark and
troubled path! And my dear bereaved young
friend! that mother, who nursed you on her knee,
who taught your infant lips to lisp the name of
Jesus, and amid whose prayers you have grown
up to maturity,&mdash;that sainted mother over whose
grave you have often wept in bitter anguish, hovers
over you now with all the passionate fondness
of a mother&#8217;s love, guides and impresses you, attends

you in all your walks, takes charge of you
in all your steps; soothes you in your sorrows;
and when burning with fever on the sick bed,
fans you with angel wing and breath, and warms
your chilled nerves with an angel&#8217;s heart!</p>

<p class="dgp">Now when we regard the departed of our
homes in this light, shall we not admit that the
death of those who go to heaven is a blessing,
not only to them, but to those they leave behind!
And especially when we remember that they return
to us in spirit to minister to our wants even
unto the smallest details of life, that they are our
guardian angels, are with, us wherever we go, to
warn and deliver us from temptation and clanger,
to urge us in the path of duty, to smooth our pillow
when thrown upon beds of languishing, and
then, when the vital spark has fled, to convey us
to the paradise of God,&mdash;oh, when we remember
this, we say, shall we not rather bless God that
He has afflicted us? Though our hearts may be
lonely, yet with this view of the departed ones of
our home, we can feel that we are, nevertheless,
not alone.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"I am not quite alone. Around me glide</p>
<p class="l">  Unnumbered beings of the unseen world;&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">And one dear spirit hovering by my side,</p>

<p class="l">It then will wait to hear my soul on high!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What afflicted heart will not respond with deep

</div>

<p class="noindent">What a comfort does this view of the pious dead
afford the pious living. We commend it now to
you. What consolation to the bereaved parents is
the assurance that all infants are saved! This
gives them "beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for
mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit
of heaviness." Your infant has gone to heaven;
for "of such is the kingdom of heaven." Zuinlius
was perhaps the first who proclaimed salvation for
all who died in infancy. He based this doctrine,
so comforting to the afflicted parent, upon the
atonement of Christ for all; and he believed that
Christ made provision for infants in this general
atonement or redemption of human nature. This
is the general belief now. Calvin declared that
"God adopts infants and washes them in the blood
of his son," and that "they are regarded by Christ
as among His flock." Dr. Junkin says, "It is not
inconsistent with any doctrine of the bible, that

the souls of deceased infants go to heaven." Newton
says, "I hope you are both well reconciled to
the death of your child. Indeed, I cannot be sorry
for the death of infants. How many storms do
they escape! Nor can I doubt, in my private
judgment, that they are included in the election
of grace." This is the opinion, too, of all evangelical
branches of the Christian church. If so,
you have here a source of great consolation.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Though it he hard to bid thy heart divide,</p>
<p class="l">And lay the gem of all thy love aside&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Faith tells thee, and it tells thee not in vain,</p>
<p class="l">That thou shalt meet thy infant yet again."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What, oh, what, if you had not the assurance
of the salvation of all infants? What if your
faith would tell you that all children who die before
they can exercise faith would he lost or annihilated!
Then indeed you might well refuse to
be comforted because they are not. But your
child is not lost,&mdash;but only removed to a better
home:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">   "A treasure but removed,</p>
<p class="l">A bright bird parted for a clearer day&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">   Yours still in heaven!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And yours to meet there! The hope of a glorious
reunion with, departed friends in heaven,
lifts the afflicted Christian into regions of happiness
never before enjoyed. And as he contemplates
their better state, and, muses over the trials

and sorrows of his pilgrim land, he longs to pass
over the stream which divides that happy home
from this. He is grateful to God that heaven has
thus become doubly attractive by his bereavement,
and that he can look forward with fond anticipation,
to the time when he shall there become
reunited with those who have gone before.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">  "Oh! I could weep</p>
<p class="l">With very gratitude that thou art saved&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Thy soul forever saved. What though my heart</p>
<p class="l">Should bleed at every pore&mdash;still thou art blessed.</p>
<p class="l">There is an hour, my precious innocent,</p>
<p class="l">When we shall meet again! Oh! may we meet</p>
<p class="l">To separate no more. Yes! I can smile,</p>
<p class="l">And sing with gratitude, and weep with joy,</p>
<p class="l">Even while my heart is breaking!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We infer from the whole subject, that we should
not murmur against God when afflicted, however
great our bereavements may he. This does not,
of course, forbid godly sorrow and tears. It is
not inconsistent to weep; neither does sorrow
for the dead, as such, imply a murmuring spirit.
Christ himself invited to tears when he wept over
the grave of his friend Lazarus. It is meet that
we pay our tribute to departed kindred, in falling
tears. These are not selfish; neither is the sorrow
they express, a sin, nor an evidence of filial
distrust, or of reluctant submission to the will of
God. The unfeeling stoic may regard it such;
but he outrages the generous impulses of humanity.
Undefiled religion does not aim to cancel

natural affection. Our piety, if genuine, will
not make us guilty of crimes against nature, and
prompt us to bend with apathy over the grave of
buried, love. The mother of Jesus wept her
pungent woes beneath the Cross; and the Marys
dropt the tear of sorrowing love and memory at
the mouth of his sepulchre. And shall we refuse
the tribute of sorrow to the memory of those
dear ones who sleep beneath the sod? To do so
would, but unchristianize the deep grief which
bereavement awakens, and which true piety sanctifies;
it would unhumanize the very constitution
of home itself. To be Christians, must the unnumbered
memories of life be all without a tear?
When we walk in the family grave-yard, and
think of the loved who slumber there; when we
open the family bible, and read, there the names
of those who have gone before us, say, shall this
awaken no slumbering grief, invite no warm,
gushing tears, and not bear us back to scenes of
tenderness and love?</p>

<p class="dgp">Ah, no! The gospel encourages godly sorrow
over the dead. We are permitted to sorrow,
only not as those who have no hope, as not being
cast down, and as not being disquieted within
us. Such godly sorrow is refreshing, and the
tears it sheds are a balm to the wounded spirit.
They refine our sentiments, and beget longings
after a better country. The memory of bereaved
affection is grief. In traversing the past, our
thoughts glide along a procession of dear events
arrested by the tomb; and we become sad and

weep. But this is not inconsistent with a confiding
faith in God, nor with a meek: resignation to
His afflicting providence. Faith was not designed
to overpower a visible privation. When death
enters our home we should feel pungently, though
we have the faith of an angel, and weep before
the smile of God. The evidences of faith, and
the brilliant idealities of hope will hush the voice
of murmur, and incite us to kiss the rod that is
laid upon us.</p>

<p class="dgp">It is, therefore, a Christian privilege to weep
over the death of our departed kindred, yea, who
can stifle the anguish of the heart when the tender
flowers of home sink into the waxen form of
death? when the flickering flame of infant life
burns lower and weaker; when the death-glazed
eye is closed, and the little bosom heaves no
more, and that lovely form becomes cold as the
grave, what parental heart can then remain unmoved,
and what eye can then forbid a tear? Not
even the assurance of infant salvation and the
hope of reunion in heaven, can prevent sorrow
for the dead.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"To think his child is blest above,</p>
<p class="l">   To pray their parting grief,</p>
<p class="l">These, these may soothe, but death alone,</p>
<p class="l">   Can heal a father&#8217;s grief."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But this grief should never amount to dissatisfaction
with God. Though it is right to weep, it
is wrong to murmur. Many parents murmuringly

mourn the loss of their children, and in
wrestling with God to spare them, betray the
want of a true submission to His will. It is sinful
to murmur at the decrees of God. We have
seen that they are wise, and all designed for our
good. Methinks if your dying babe could respond
to your murmuring sighs and tears around
its crib, it would thus reprove you:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Nay, mother, fix not thus on me</p>
<p class="l">  That streaming eye,</p>
<p class="l">And clasp not thus my freezing hand;</p>
<p class="l">  For I must die.</p>
<p class="l">To Him ye gave the opening bud,</p>
<p class="l">  The early bloom;</p>
<p class="l">Then grieve not that the ripened fruit</p>
<p class="l">  He gathers home."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But we should not only refrain from murmuring,
but meekly submit to the providential afflictions
of our home. We should remember that
all the adversities of life are from the Lord, and
that when death invades our household, and
crushes the fond hopes of our hearts, it is for
some wise and good purpose. Though we may
not understand it here, where we look through
a glass darkly; but eternity will reveal it. Though
the dying of a child is like tearing a limb from
us; but remember God demands it. Surrender
it to Him, therefore, with Christian resignation.
He does not demand it without a cause. It may
offend thee, though it be a right hand or a right
eye. Let the branch be cut off. At the resurrection

you shall see it again. Give it up willingly;
for it is the Lord&#8217;s will that you should.
Have the meek submission, to exclaim, "Not my
will, but Thine be done!" Whatever may be
your pleas to the contrary, they are all selfish;
when, you come to look at your bereavement,
with the candid, discerning eye of faith, you cannot
murmur; but will bend under the stroke with
silent tears and with grateful submission. Faith
in God, the hope of reunion in heaven, and true
Christian love for the object taken from us, will
effectually quell every uprising of complaint in
our hearts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dgp">The bereavements of home fill up the urn
of memory with its most hallowed treasures.
Though these memories of the household have

an alloy of sorrow and are the product of its adversities,
yet there is no pleasure so delicate, so
pure, so painful, so much longed after, as that
which they afford. They bring to our hearts the
purest essence of the past, and cause us to live it
over again. They come over us like the "breath
of the sweet south breathing over a bed of violets."
When we revert to the happy scenes of
our childhood, we live amid them in spirit again,
and remembrance swells with many a proof of
recollected love; sweet ideals of all that lived
under the parental roof spring up within us, and
pass before us in visions of delight; the home of
the past becomes the home of the present. The
things of that home are spiritualized and changed
into the thoughts of home; we enjoy them again;
and we live our life over again with those we loved
the most.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">   "Why in age</p>
<p class="l">Do we revert so fondly to the walks</p>
<p class="l">Of childhood, but that there the soul discerns</p>
<p class="l">The dear memorial footsteps, unimpaired,</p>
<p class="l">Of her own native vigor; thence can hear</p>
<p class="l">Reverberations, and a choral song</p>
<p class="l">Commingling with the incense that ascends,</p>
<p class="l">Undaunted, towards the imperishable heavens,</p>
<p class="l">From her own lonely altar?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The memories of home are both pleasing and
painful. When we leave the parental home for
some distant land, how many pleasing recollections
sweep over our spirits then. Even when

tossed to and fro upon the angry wave, far from
our native land.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"There comes a fond memory</p>
<p class="l">Of home o&#8217;er the deep."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The memory of departed worth is a kind of compensation
for the loss we sustain. The pious mother&#8217;s
recollection of her sainted husband or child
becomes the soother of her grief, and casts a pleasing
light along her pathway, and awakens a new
joy in her widowed heart. Pious memories, when
they reflect the hope of reunion in heaven, are like
the radiant sky studded with brilliant stars, each
shining through the clouds which move along the
verge of the horizon. They sweep as gently over
the troubled heart as the summer zephyr over the
blushing rose, touching all the chords of holy feeling,
making them vibrate sadly sweet, in blended
tones, too sweet to last.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Here a deeper and serener charm</p>
<p class="l">    To all is given,</p>
<p class="l">And blessed memories of the faithful dead</p>
<p class="l">O&#8217;er wood and vale, and meadow-stream have shed</p>
<p class="l">    The holy hues of heaven."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">How indelibly does memory paint the image of a
departed child upon the mother&#8217;s heart! No flight
of years; no distance from the grave in which he
slumbers, can erase the image. It will be ever
fresh, and, with awakening power, mingle with
her tears and glow in her fondest hopes. Though
time and distance and vicissitudes may calm her

troubled heart, and cause her to settle down into
tranquility of feeling; but these can never destroy
the tenacity and vividness of her memory. Even
then those objects to which it fondly clings, become
the theme of her holiest and her happiest
thoughts; and she retains them with a passionate
ardor, exceeded only by that with which she clung
to the living child. Her greatest pleasure is, to
retire from the busy cares of the world, to some
solitude where she may sit among flowers that remind
her of the one that withered in her arms,
and meditate upon him who slumbers beneath the
clods of the valley. Oh, these are sweet and precious
moments to her; and the tears which are
then drawn from the deep well-springs of reminiscence,
are sacred to him with whom she in
spirit there communes. There with, rapture she
remembers</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"All his winning ways,</p>
<p class="l">His pretty, playful smiles,</p>
<p class="l">His joy, his ecstasy,</p>
<p class="l">His tricks, his mimicry,</p>
<p class="l">And all his little wiles;</p>
<p class="l">Oh! these are recollections</p>
<p class="l">Round mothers&#8217; hearts that cling&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">That mingle with the tears</p>
<p class="l">And smiles of after years,</p>
<p class="l">With oft awakening!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Memory links together the loved, ones of home
though they be widely separated from each other,
some on earth, and some in eternity. There is
a mystic chain which binds them together, and

brings them in spirit near to each other and infuses,
as it were, with electric power, a realizing sense
of each other, while their past life under the
same roof, "like shadows o&#8217;er them sweep." In
the light of memory their faded forms are vividly
brought back to view; they see each other as when
they rambled over their childhood haunts; and the
echo of their playful mirth comes booming back
in deep reverberations through their souls. In
this respect the memory of the dead is a pleasure
so deep and delicate, and withal so melancholy,
yea, so painful, that the heart shrinks from its
intensity. This we experience when we ramble
through the family graveyard, and bring within
the sweep of recollection our past communion
with the loved who slumber there. There is a
mysterious feeling awakened in our hearts,&mdash;a
feeling of peculiar melancholy, which, combines
two opposite emotions,&mdash;that of pleasure and that
of pain. These seem to embrace each other, and
their union in our hearts affords us a strange enjoyment.
We enjoy the pain; the agony awakened
by the remembrance of those who lie beneath the
sod is pleasing to us. It is a bitter cup we love to
drink; we love to keep open the wounds there inflicted.
The sadness we then feel we dearly cherish;
and we linger around these tombs as if bound
to them by some mystic chord we could not break;
we are loth to leave a spot in which are accumulated
the fondest associations of early life. Would
the mother, if she could, forget the child that slumbers
beneath the flower-crowned sod of the family

cemetery? "Where," in the beautiful language
of Irving, "is the child, that would willingly forget
the most tender of parents, though to remember
be but to lament? Who, even in the hour
of agony, would forget the friend over whom he
mourns? Who, even when the tomb is closing
upon the remains of her he most loved and he
feels his heart, as it were, crushed in the closing
of its portals, would accept consolation that was
to be bought by forgetfulness? And when the
overwhelming burst of grief is calmed into the
gentle tear of recollection, when the sudden anguish
and the convulsive agony over the present
ruins of all that we most loved, is softened away
into pensive meditation on all that it was in the
days of its loveliness, who would root out such a
sorrow from the heart? Though it may sometimes
throw a passing cloud even over the bright
hour of gayety, yet who would exchange it even
for the song of pleasure or the burst of revelry?
No; there is a voice from the tomb sweeter than
song; there is a recollection of the dead to which
we turn even from the charms of the living!"
How passionately we cling to those memories of
a sainted mother, which crowd in rapid succession
upon our minds!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Weep not for her! Her memory is the shrine</p>
<p class="l">  Of pleasing thoughts, soft as the scent of flowers,</p>
<p class="l">Calm as on windless eve the sun&#8217;s decline,</p>
<p class="l">  Sweet as the song of birds among the bowers."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What a purifying and restraining influence does

the memory of a pious parent&#8217;s love, exert upon
the wayward child! When he bends in mournful
recollection over the grave of a sainted mother,
how must every heart-string break, and with what
remorse he reviews his past life of wickedness and
filial disobedience. The memory of that mother&#8217;s
love and kindness to him, haunts him in all his
revels, and draws him back, as if by magnetic
force, from scenes of riot and of ruin. Can he
think of that mother&#8217;s prayers and teachings and
tears of solicitude, and not feel deeply, and often
savingly, his own guilt and ingratitude? If there
is a memory of home-life which allures him to
heaven, it is the recollection of her love and pious
efforts to save him.</p>

<p class="dgp">The child who lives in exile from his country
and his home, is soothed in the midst of his cares
and disappointments, by the stirring imagery of
his far-distant friends and home. And oh, if he
has been unfaithful to the ministrations of that
home; if he has trodden under foot the proffered
love of his parents, and repulsed all the overtures
of their pious solicitude, will not the memory of
their anguish haunt his soul, and plough deep furrows
of remorse in his conscience? The sense of
past filial ingratitude, and the recollection of a parent&#8217;s
injured love and disappointed hope, constitute
one of the most powerful incentives to repentance
and reformation. It was thus with the prodigal
son. As soon as he came to himself, he remembered
the dear home of his youth, the kind
love of his father, and his own unworthiness and

ingratitude; and this brought him to repentance
and to the resolution to return to his father, confess
his sin, and seek pardon. How many now, in
thus looking back upon the home of their childhood,
do not remember their abuse of parental
love and kindness!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Oh! in our stern manhood, when no ray</p>
<p class="l">Of earlier sunshine glimmers on our way;</p>
<p class="l">When girt with sin and sorrow, and the toil</p>
<p class="l">Of cares, which tear the bosom that they soil;</p>
<p class="l">Oh! if there be in retrospection&#8217;s chain</p>
<p class="l">One link that knits us with young dreams again&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">One thought so sweet we scarcely dare to muse</p>
<p class="l">On all the hoarded raptures it reviews;</p>
<p class="l">Which seems each instant, in its backward range,</p>
<p class="l">The heart to soften, and its ties to change,</p>
<p class="l">And every spring untouched for years to move,</p>
<p class="l">It is&mdash;the memory of a mother&#8217;s love!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We see, therefore, that there are painful, as well
as pleasant, memories of home. When the absent
disobedient child remembers how he abused
the privileges of the parental home, and brought
the gray hairs of his parents down with sorrow to
the grave, and turned that household into a desolation;
when</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Pensive memory lingers o&#8217;er</p>
<p class="l">Those scenes to be enjoyed no more,</p>
<p class="l">Those scenes regretted ever,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">how dark and painful must be the shadows which
then sweep over his penitent spirit! "If thou art
a child, and hast ever added a sorrow to the soul

or a furrow to the silvered brow of an affectionate
parent; if thou art a husband, and hast ever
caused the fond bosom that ventured its whole
happiness in thy arms, to doubt one moment of
thy kindness or thy truth; if thou art a friend,
and hast ever wronged the spirit that generously
confided in thee; if thou art a lover, and hast
ever given one unmerited pang to that true heart
that now lies cold and still beneath thy feet; then
be sure that every unkind look, every ungracious
word, every ungentle action, will come thronging
back upon thy memory; then be sure that
thou wilt lie down sorrowing and penitent on the
grave!"</p>

<p class="dgp">If we would avoid the agony of declining age,
let us be faithful to our childhood-home. What
must be the anguish of that wretch who has
brought infamy upon it; how painful must be
every recollection of it, when in the distance of
years and of space, from its scenes and its loved
ones, his remembrance hails them with its burning
tear.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"I am far from the home that gave me birth,</p>
<p class="l">  A blight is on my name;</p>
<p class="l">It only brings to my father&#8217;s hearth</p>
<p class="l">  The memory of shame;</p>
<p class="l">Yet, oh! do they think of me to-day,</p>
<p class="l">  The loved ones lingering there;</p>
<p class="l">Do they think of the outcast far away,</p>
<p class="l">  And breathe for me a prayer?</p>
<p class="l">That early home I shall see no more,</p>
<p class="l">  And I wish not there to go,</p>

<p class="l">For the happy past may nought restore&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">  The future is but woe.</p>
<p class="l">But &#8217;twould be a balm to my heavy heart</p>
<p class="l">  Upon its dreary way,</p>
<p class="l">If I could think I have a part</p>
<p class="l">  In the prayers of home to-day!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Every thing within the memory of home will
question our hearts whether we have been faithful
to her parental ministry. Every cherished
association; every remembered object, and even
the old scenes and objects around the homestead,
will challenge our faithfulness. The trees under
whose shade we frolicked and of whose fruit we
ate; the streams that meandered through the
meadow; the hills and groves over which we
gamboled in the sunny days of childhood; the
old oaken bucket and the old ancestral walls that
yet stand as monuments of the past,&mdash;these will
all question your fidelity to the training you received
in their midst; and oh, if they assume, in
the courts of memory, the attitude of witnesses
against you; if nursery recollections speak of forgotten
prayers and abandoned habits, what a deep
and painful sense of guilt and ingratitude will this
testimony develop in your bosom, and</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Darken&#8217;d and troubled you&#8217;ll come at last,</p>
<p class="l">To the home of your boyish glee."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">How precious are the mementoes of home!
Memory needs such auxiliaries. That lock of
silken hair which the mother holds with tearful
contemplation, and wears as a precious relic, near

her heart, what recollections of the buried one it
awakens within her!</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Thou bringest fond memories of a gentle girl,</p>
<p class="l">Like passing spirits in a summer night!</p>
<p class="l">      Oh, precious curl!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And that picture of a departed mother which the
orphan child presses with holy reverence to her
bosom! As she gazes upon those familiar features,
and reads in them a mother&#8217;s love and
kindness, what scenes of home-life rise upon the
troubled thought, and what echoes of love come
through the lapse of years from the old homestead,
touching all the fires of her soul, and causing
them to thrill with plaintive sadness and with
painful joy. What mementoes of a sad, yet pleasing
memory are found in the chamber of bereavement,
where death has done his work; the empty
chair; the garments laid by; playthings idly scattered
there;&mdash;these are pictures upon which the
eye of memory rests with pensive meditation.
And our letters from home! What sweet recollections
they awaken as we read line after line;
and what volumes of love they contain from those
dear ones who now moulder in the narrow vaults
of death! Oh, how miserable must he be who has
no recollections of home, who is not able to revert
to the scenes of childhood, and amid whose cherished
memories of life, the image of a mother does
not glow!</p>

<p class="dgp">Let us lay the foundation of a joyful, grateful
memory. Let us be faithful to home, that when

we leave it, and when the members of it leave us,
we may delight in all the memories which loom
up from the scenes of home-life:</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Oh, friends regretted, scenes forever dear,</p>
<p class="l">Remembrance hails you with her burning tear!</p>
<p class="l">Drooping she bends o&#8217;er pensive fancy&#8217;s urn,</p>
<p class="l">To trace the hours which never can return;</p>
<p class="l">Yet with retrospection loves to dwell,</p>
<p class="l">And soothe the sorrows of her last farewell!"</p>

<h2 class="dgp">Chapter XXVIII&mdash;The Antitype Of The Christian Home.</h2>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Oh, talk to me of heaven! I love</p>
<p class="l">To hear about my home above;</p>
<p class="l">For there doth many a loved one dwell</p>
<p class="l">In light and joy ineffable.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"O! tell me how they shine and sing,</p>
<p class="l">While every harp rings echoing,</p>
<p class="l">And every glad and tearless eye</p>
<p class="l">Beams like the bright sun gloriously.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Tell me of that victorious palm,</p>
<p class="l">  Each hand in glory beareth;</p>
<p class="l">Tell me of that celestial calm,</p>
<p class="l">  Each face in glory weareth!"</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">The Christian home on earth is but a type of
his better home in heaven. The pious members
feel the force of this. Every thing within their
earthly homes reminds them of that happy country

which lies beyond the Jordan. Besides, they
behold the impress of change upon every aspect
of their home. All that is near and dear to them
there is passing away. It is but the shadow of
better things to come. And as the type bears
some resemblance to that which it typifies, we
may understand both by considering the relation
they sustain to each other. We may gain a new
view of the Christian home by looking at it in
the light of its typical relation to heaven; and we
have a transporting view of our heavenly home
when we contemplate it as the antitype of our
home on earth.</p>

<p class="dgp">The Christian home on earth is a tent-home, a
tabernacle adapted to the pilgrim-life of God&#8217;s
people, set up in a dreary wilderness, designed to
subserve the purposes of a few years, as a preparation
for a better home. The Christian, amid all
his domestic enjoyments, does not realize that his
home is his rest, but that it is only a probationary
state, the foretaste and anticipation of the
rest that remaineth for the people of God. It
is but the emblem,&mdash;the shadow of his eternal
home; and it is, therefore, unsatisfying; it does
not meet all the wants of our nature; there is a
yearning after a better state; the purest happiness
it affords proceeds from the hopes and longings
it begets, and the interests it is transferring
to eternity, laying up, as it were, treasures in a
better home. Our home here, develops our wants,
inflames our desires, excites our expectations, educates,
and points us to the realities of which it

is an emblem; but it does not fully satisfy our
desires, it only increases their intensity. The
pilgrim soul of the child of God pines and frets
amid all</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Her sylvan scenes, and hill and dale</p>
<p class="l">And liquid lapse of murmuring streams."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These afford him no satisfaction; they only develop
in him the saving sense of earth&#8217;s insufficiency;
all the scenes of this wilderness state
are but those of thorns, and desert heath, and
barren sands; and he cries out in the midst
of his happy home,&mdash;"This is not your rest!"
Our tent-home may include every earthly cup,
and all the riches and honors of the world, yet
it satisfies not, and the Christian turns from
it all to rest and expatiate in a life to come.
Every home here is baptized with tears and
scarred with graves. Its poverty is a burden,
its riches are snares, its friends are taken from
us; broken hearts agonized there; restlessness
is tossed to and fro there; and disappointment
reigns in every member there. Hence in our
wilderness-home we hunger and thirst, and pine
for something more satisfying. We turn from
the shadow to the reality; and realizing the insufficiency
of home as a mere type, we turn
with anxious hope to that which it typifies&mdash;our
heavenly home.</p>

<p class="dgp">Heaven is the antitype of the Christian home.
There the latter reaches its consummation, and

reaps the rich harvest of its great reward. The
Father; the Mother of us all; our Brethren; our
inheritance; our all sufficiency are there. Yea,
all that is included in the dear name of home, is
treasured up there, for the child of God. In that
better land he finds the reality of his home on
earth; the latter is but the prophecy of the former:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"There is my house and portion fair,</p>
<p class="l">My treasure and my heart are there,</p>
<p class="l">  And my abiding home."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That better home is radiant with light and love.
There you shall not see through a glass darkly,
but shall behold all things face to face. You
shall not merely know in part, but even as you
are known. There you shall realize in all its fulness
what you dimly taste here. We have a hunger
here which is not fully satisfied till in heaven
we pluck the fruits of the tree of life. We have
a thirst here which is not fully quenched till in
heaven we drink of the waters of the river of
life which flows fast by the throne of God. In
our tent-home here, we eat and drink, but hunger
and thirst again; we are healed, but we sicken
again; we live in the light of truth, but darkness
and clouds intervene; we are comforted by the
spirit and by friends; but we sorrow and weep
again.</p>

<p class="dgp">But in heaven "sighing grief shall weep no
more;" and we "shall hunger no more, neither
shall we thirst any more; and we shall not say I

am sick; and there shall be no night, nor sorrow,
nor tears, nor sighing, nor death; for the former
things are passed away." Love will then be perfect;
there will be no heart-burnings and disappointments
there. There you shall enjoy the
honey without the sting, and the rose without the
thorn. "Earth hath no sorrows that heaven cannot
heal." All care and toil, and tears, and orphanage,
and widowhood, shall drop and disappear
at the threshold of heaven. If our tent-home
stirs up within us imperishable joys, by the
power of anticipation and foretaste, what joy will
not that better land afford? If the promise is so
cheering, what must the fulfillment be! If the
pursuit is so inspiring, what must the possession
be! If our home on Tabor, where we have but a
distant view of home-life, affords us so much happiness,
what must our home on the eternal throne
of God be? There your intercourse with the
loved ones of earth will not be clogged by pain
and infirmities. Your society there will be the
most endearing, and with "a great multitude
which no man could number, of all nations, and
kindred, and people, and tongues, standing before
the throne, clothed with white robes, and palms
in their hands." You shall there hold fellowship
with the fathers of a thousand generations, with
the patriarchs, and prophets, and apostles, and
martyrs, and reformers, and the "innumerable
company of angels." With these you shall engage
in the most delightful avocation. There
will be no indolence there, as we often find in

earthly homes; but all will be continually engaged.
"They serve Him day and night in His
temple." There will be one unbroken worship,
which will afford you rapturous delight. You
shall be presented, before God&#8217;s glory, with exceeding
joy; for "in His presence is fullness of
joy, and at His right hand are pleasures for evermore."
These joys will be eternal,&mdash;forever and
ever. That better home will never be dissolved,
cannot be shaken, and your crown of glory there
is a crown which fadeth not away.</p>

<p class="dgp">But this happiness and glory of heaven are not
only eternal but progressive,&mdash;ever increasing.
There is nothing stationary there with the saints;
but their powers will ever expand and their glory
increase. New songs will be ever bursting in new
strains from the celestial choir; new discoveries
and fresh exclamations of praise and gratitude
will he continually made. Here on earth they
were "by nature the children of wrath, even as
others;" they had their tribulations and often
murmured at God&#8217;s dealings with them. But
there in that heavenly home they will understand
the reason for all this. The deep mysteries of
the Christian life are now revealed, and they see
that a father&#8217;s chastisements are the work of a
father&#8217;s love, and worketh out for them that are
exercised thereby, an "exceeding and eternal
weight of glory." They now see that while in
their tent-home they lived in the center of a
grand system of natural, providential and spiritual
things, all of which were working in beautiful

harmony together for "the good of them that
loved God and were the called according to His
purpose;" and with rapturous gratitude they cry
out, "Marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty;
just and true are all thy ways, O thou
King of Saints!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Here, too, they will fully realize the wisdom of
the Christian home and life; they will now see
how wise it was for them as a family, to serve the
Lord. In their earthly home, they "knew whom
they believed, and were persuaded that he was
able to keep that which they committed unto
Him against that day." They did this in the
midst of fiery trials. They were unknown. The
world, hated and despised them as she did their
divine Master. But they persevered unto the
end; and now they "shine forth as the sun in the
kingdom of their Father." We shall not there,
as we do here, eat the bread of care and drink
the waters of bitterness. Here thunders spend
their echoes and lightnings gleam in fierce wrath
around our homes. There such sounds and storms
never come.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"No sickness there,</p>
<p class="l">  No weary wasting of the frame away;</p>
<p class="l">No fearful shrinking from the midnight air;</p>
<p class="l">  No dread of summer&#8217;s bright and fervid ray.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"No hidden grief,</p>
<p class="l">  No wild and cheerless vision of despair;</p>
<p class="l">No vain petition for a swift relief,</p>
<p class="l">  No tearful eye, no broken hearts are there</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Care has no home</p>
<p class="l">  Within that realm of ceaseless praise and song;</p>
<p class="l">Its tossing billows break and melt in foam,</p>
<p class="l">  Far from the mansions of the spirit-throng.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"The storm&#8217;s black wing</p>
<p class="l">  Is never spread athwart celestial skies;</p>
<p class="l">Its wailings blend not with the voice of spring,</p>
<p class="l">  As some too tender floweret fades and dies."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Christ is the great center of heaven&#8217;s glory and
attraction. "Whom have I in heaven but thee?"
It would not be heaven if He were absent. Its
harps would become unstrung, and its voices
would lose their tune. When eternity dawns upon
our disembodied spirits, and the heavenly
home appears in view, with its golden streets, and
living temples, and crowns, and thrones, and joys,
bursting on our sight; while seraphim and cherubim,
and angels, and the sainted spirits of departed
friends&mdash;our parents and children, and kindred,
bend over its threshold to hail our entrance
with songs and shouts of everlasting joy,&mdash;oh,
what a glorious heritage will this be! But all
this will fade into insignificance before the Lamb
on the throne. He will absorb all interest; and
will be all and in all to its unfading treasures.
Oh, there is much in that celestial home to allure
us there. Its "fields arrayed in living green, and
rivers of delight." Its blood-washed throng, its
crowns and peace, the angelic choir, our friends
and relations,&mdash;perhaps a father and a mother,

perhaps a husband or wife, perhaps a brother
or a sister, or a child,&mdash;a lovely babe;&mdash;all these
make heaven dear, and draw us there. They
beckon us to themselves; they are waiting for
us now, and on the glowing pinions of love
they come thronging as ministering spirits, to our
hearts.</p>

<p class="dgp">But what are all these attractions of that spirit-home,
compared with Jesus there as the crowning
glory of them all! other things are stars and
streamlets. He is the central sun,&mdash;the source
of all. Take Him away, and all the brightness
and the glory of that heavenly world would become
shrouded in darkness and desolation.</p>

<p class="dgp">There is a living union between the Christian&#8217;s
home on earth, and his home in heaven. Christ
represents our nature and advocates our cause
there. The saints on earth and the inhabitants
of heaven "but one communion make." The
latter minister to the former. "Are they not all
ministering spirits, sent to minister unto them
who shall be the heirs of salvation?"</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Oh! a mother&#8217;s spirit hung</p>
<p class="l">  O&#8217;er her last pledge of earthly love,</p>
<p class="l">And, while attending angel&#8217;s sung,</p>
<p class="l">  Welcom&#8217;d her dear one home above.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Gentle babe, I come for thee:</p>
<p class="l">  I did come to bear thee home,</p>
<p class="l">Far from mortal agony;</p>
<p class="l">  Come, then, gentle infant, come.</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Yes; while o&#8217;er thy mouldering dust</p>
<p class="l">  Falls the tear of earthly love,</p>
<p class="l">Thou shalt live amidst the just,</p>
<p class="l">  Brighter life in heaven above."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Every thing good in our earthly home has its
echo in heaven, and sweeps like the breath of God
over the harps of the blessed. When the pious
mother kneels with her child in prayer to God,
it sends a thrill of new ecstasy into the bosom of
the redeemed around His throne. When the
child gives its heart to Christ, each harp bursts
forth with a new anthem of joy at the prospect of
that accession to their happy band. And oh,
what unspeakable joy must thrill the bosom of a
sainted mother when the news of her child&#8217;s conversion
reaches her there!&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">... "A new harp is strung, and a new song is given</p>
<p class="l">To the breezes that float o&#8217;er the gardens of heaven."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And there, too, sainted relations continually
warn the impenitent members of the tent-home.
"Though dead they yet speak." "Turn ye, turn
ye; for why will ye die?" "The spirit and the
bride say, come!" Oh, regard those solemn admonitions
which come to you from the spirit-world!
With unearthly eloquence they urge
you to "lay aside every weight and the sin
that doth so easily beset you, and run the race
set before you, looking unto Jesus, the author
and finisher of your faith." And oh, if you, in
obedience to these angelic persuasives to piety,

yield yourself unto the Lord, all the arches of that
eternal home will reverberate with the sound of
jubilee over your salvation, until its echo from
harp to harp shall be borne up to the throne of
God.</p>

<p class="dgp">And as there is a living union of the Christian&#8217;s
home on earth and in heaven, so also will
there be a conscious union and recognition of the
members of the Christian home, when they enter
that better land. When the tent-home is broken
up, and its members take their place and enter
upon their joys in the heavenly home, they will
recognize each other, and exchange congratulations.
The bonds of natural affection which
bound them together here will bind them also
there. They will possess the same home-feeling
and sympathy; they will love each other as members
of the same household; the parents will know
and love their children as parents; and the children
will feel towards their parents as children.
Thus in the clear light of that blessed land we
shall see and know our kindred, and shall be recognized,
and known by them. All family ties will
be re-knit; all home-relationships will be restored;
all the links of affection will be renewed.
The babe that withered in your arms like a frost-stricken
flower in winter, will come forth clad in
redemption robes, to embrace you there; and
one of your joys will be a conscious reunion with
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"We shall go home to our Father&#8217;s house:</p>
<p class="l">  To our Father&#8217;s house in the skies,</p>

<p class="l">Where the hope of our souls shall have no blight,</p>
<p class="l">  Our love no broken ties;</p>
<p class="l">We shall roam on the banks of the river of peace,</p>
<p class="l">  And bathe in its blissful tide;</p>
<p class="l">And one of the joys of our heaven shall be,</p>
<p class="l">  The little boy that died!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And that sainted mother of yours shall greet you
there. In your earth-home, you and she were
united in faith and love and hope; and in the
morning of the resurrection you shall ascend
together from the family grave-yard; and together
bow in grateful adoration before the throne of
God.</p>

<p class="dgp">And oh, what a glorious meeting in heaven
that will be, when all the members of the Christian
household shall unitedly surround the marriage
supper of the Lamb! It will be joyful beyond
conception. There they "shall meet at
Jesus&#8217; feet,&mdash;shall meet to part no more!" No
one is absent. Bright faces will meet there;
bounding hearts will meet there; and on the
banks of the river of life they will walk hand
in hand, as they did unitedly in this vale of
tears. "There is hereafter to be no separation
in that family. No one is to lie down on a bed
of pain. No one to wander away into temptation.
No one to sink into the arms of death.
Never in heaven is that family to move along the
slow procession, clad in the habiliments of woe,
to consign one of its members to the tomb!"&mdash;REV.
A. BARNES.</p>

<p class="dgp">If heaven is our better home, where the members

of Christian families meet to part no more;
if dreams cannot picture a world so fair; and if
eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor human heart
conceived, the felicity of its peaceful inhabitants,
then we should greatly rejoice that our pious kindred
have been taken there, and that we are
blessed with the hope of reunion with them in
that heavenly home:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">... "If to Christ, with faith sincere,</p>
<p class="l">  Your babe at death was given,</p>
<p class="l">The kindred tie that bound you here,</p>
<p class="l">Though rent apart with many a tear,</p>
<p class="l">  Shall be renewed in heaven!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In our tent-home, we should cultivate spiritual
longings after heaven, and live in the true hope
and assurance of entering there. The soul of the
Christian, conscious of the emptiness of all things
here, rests and expatiates in a life to come. In
proportion to his preparation for it, and his nearness
to it, will be the depth of his aspirations and
the assurance of his hope. The widowed mother,
who feels that part of her household is in heaven
and that soon she will join them there, yearns
with all the pining of home-sickness, for departure
to the promised land, which is far better.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"When shall my labors have an end,</p>
<p class="l">In joy and peace and thee!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Even these hopes and longings after reunion
with the departed in heaven, afford her joy, and

open in her panting spirit a foretaste of unearthly
bliss. To her aspiring faith all things look heavenward.
The stars of the sky, and the flowers
of the field smile their blessings upon her; and
she welcomes death to break off her chains, to
draw the bolts and bars, and open the prison doors
of her house of clay, that her home-sick spirit may
go up to that happier land where her possessions
lie:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Let me go! my heart is fainting</p>
<p class="l">  &#8217;Neath its weight of sin and fears,</p>
<p class="l">And my wakeful eyes are failing</p>
<p class="l">  With these ever-falling tears!</p>
<p class="l">For the morning I am sighing,</p>
<p class="l">  While I earth&#8217;s long vigils keep;</p>
<p class="l">Here the loved are ever dying,</p>
<p class="l">  And the loving live to weep!</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Let me go! I fain would follow,</p>
<p class="l">  Where I know their steps have passed&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Far beyond life&#8217;s heaving billows,</p>
<p class="l">  Finding home and heaven at last!</p>
<p class="l">While my exiled heart is pining</p>
<p class="l">  To behold my Father&#8217;s face,</p>
<p class="l">They, in His own brightness shining,</p>
<p class="l">  Beckon me to that blest place!</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Let me go! I hear them calling,</p>
<p class="l">  &#8217;Ho! thou weary one,&mdash;come home!&#8217;</p>
<p class="l">Words which on mine ears are falling,</p>
<p class="l">  Wheresoever my footsteps roam,</p>
<p class="l">I can catch the far-off murmurs</p>
<p class="l">  Of life&#8217;s river, sweet and low,</p>
<p class="l">Calling, from earth&#8217;s bitter waters,</p>
<p class="l">  Unto me&mdash;O let me go!"</p>
</div>



<p class="dgp">Gentle reader! seek that better land. Let your
home be a preparation for, and a pilgrimage to, a
home in heaven. You are now in the wilderness
beset on every side by enemies. Go forward!
You are now in the deep vale,&mdash;in the low retreats
of pilgrim life. "Friend, go up higher!"
"Be thou faithful unto death, and you shall receive
a crown of life." Be patient in tribulation.
The storms that swell around your pilgrim home
will soon subside, and a cloudless sky will burst
upon you; the winter gloom and desolation will
soon pass away; and "sweet fields arrayed in living
green and rivers of delight," will spread out
themselves before your enraptured vision. Remember
that "the sufferings of the present time
are not worthy to be compared with the glory that
shall be revealed in us." In a few years at most
the conflict shall end, and sighing grief shall weep
no more; the wormwood and the gall will be exchanged
for the cup of salvation; the armor and
the battle-field will be exchanged for the white
garment, the crown and the throne. Soon your
typical homestead shall be exchanged for your antitypical
home; and we shall unite in the home-song
of everlasting joy,&mdash;the song of, "unto Him
that loved us and washed us in His own blood, to
Him be praise and glory and dominion forever!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Let the hope of soon entering that happy home,
stimulate you to increased ardor in the cause of
your Master. Methinks, some who will read these
pages, have snow-white locks and wrinkled brows
and faded cheeks; and these tell you that soon

your pilgrim journey will be ended, your tent-home
dissolved, and your staff laid aside; and oh,
if you have made God the strength of your heart
and your portion forever, you shall welcome death
with joy; yea, you will now be anxious to lay aside
these garments of toil and conflict, and soar away
to that better country, where the wicked cease from
troubling, and the weary are at rest. With holy
pantings after God you will say, "Come, Lord
Jesus, come quickly!"</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Let me go! my feet are weary,</p>
<p class="l">  In the desert where I roam.</p>
<p class="l">Let me go! the way is dreary&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">  Let the wanderer go home!</p>
<p class="l">I am weary of the darkness</p>
<p class="l">  Of these lonely, failing streams&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">Let me go where founts are flashing</p>
<p class="l">  In the light of heaven&#8217;s beams!</p>
</div>

<div class="lg">
<p class="l">"Let me go! my soul is thirsting</p>
<p class="l">  For those waters, bright, and clear,</p>
<p class="l">From the fount of glory bursting&mdash;</p>
<p class="l">  Ah! why keep the pilgrim here?</p>
<p class="l">Let me go! O, who would linger,</p>
<p class="l">  Fainting, fearing, and athirst,</p>
<p class="l">When before us lies a region</p>
<p class="l">  Where undying pleasures burst?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We have now enumerated some of the elements
of the Christian home&mdash;its constitution, its ministry,
its trials, its joys, and its relation to a better
home in heaven. But we have not exhausted this

interesting subject; we have given but a very general
and imperfect sketch. If this our first effort
will contribute to the salvation of one soul, we
shall be compensated; and should our encouragement
justify it, we may continue the effort, in the
preparation of a work on the historical development
of the Christian home.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
