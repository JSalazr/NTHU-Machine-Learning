  <h2>PREFACE.</h2>
  <hr class="full" />

  <p>The purpose of this book is to deal with Browning, not simply as a
  poet, but rather as the exponent of a system of ideas on moral and
  religious subjects, which may fairly be called a philosophy. I am
  conscious that it is a wrong to a poet to neglect, or even to
  subordinate, the artistic aspect of his work. At least, it would be a
  wrong, if our final judgment on his poetry were to be determined on
  such a method. But there is a place for everything; and, even in the
  case of a great poet, there is sometimes an advantage in attempting
  to estimate the value of what he has said, apart from the form in
  which he has said it. And of all modern poets, Browning is the one
  who most obviously invites and justifies such a method of treatment.
  For, in the first place, he is clearly one of that class of poets who
  are also prophets. He was never merely "the idle singer of an empty
  day," but one for whom poetic enthusiasm was intimately bound up
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pgviii" id="pgviii">viii</a></span>
  with religious faith, and who spoke "in numbers," not merely "because
  the numbers came," but because they were for him the necessary
  vehicle of an inspiring thought. If it is the business of philosophy
  to analyze and interpret all the great intellectual forces that mould
  the thought of an age, it cannot neglect the works of one who has
  exercised, and is exercising so powerful an influence on the moral
  and religious life of the present generation.</p>

  <p>In the second place, as will be seen in the sequel, Browning has
  himself led the way towards such a philosophical interpretation of
  his work. For, even in his earlier poems, he not seldom crossed the
  line that divides the poet from the philosopher, and all but broke
  through the strict limits of art in the effort to express&mdash;and
  we might even say to preach&mdash;his own idealistic faith. In his
  later works he did this almost without any disguise, raising
  philosophical problems, and discussing all the <i>pros</i> and
  <i>cons</i> of their solution, with no little subtlety and
  dialectical skill. In some of these poems we might even seem to be
  receiving a philosophical lesson, in place of a poetic inspiration,
  if it were not for those powerful imaginative utterances, those
  winged words, which Browning has always in reserve, to close the
  ranks of his argument. If the question is stated in a prosaic form,
  the final answer, as in <span class="pagenum"><a name="pgix" id=
  "pgix">ix</a></span> the ancient oracle, is in the poetic language of
  the gods.</p>

  <p>From this point of view I have endeavoured to give a connected
  account of Browning's ideas, especially of his ideas on religion and
  morality, and to estimate their value. In order to do so, it was
  necessary to discuss the philosophical validity of the principles on
  which his doctrine is more or less consciously based. The more
  immediately philosophical chapters are the second, seventh, and
  ninth; but they will not be found unintelligible by those who have
  reflected on the difficulties of the moral and religious life, even
  although they may be unacquainted with the methods and language of
  the schools.</p>

  <p>I have received much valuable help in preparing this work for the
  press from my colleague, Professor G.B. Mathews, and still more from
  Professor Edward Caird. I owe them both a deep debt of gratitude.</p>

  <h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Grau, theurer Freund, ist alle Theorie,</p>

    <p>Und grün des Lebens goldner Baum." (<i>Faust</i>.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>There is a saying of Hegel's, frequently quoted, that "a great man
  condemns the world to the task of explaining him." The condemnation
  is a double one, and it generally falls heaviest on the great man
  himself, who has to submit to explanation; and, probably, the last
  refinement of this species of cruelty is to expound a poet. I
  therefore begin with an apology in both senses of the term. I
  acknowledge that no commentator on art has a right to be heard, if he
  is not aware of the subordinate and temporary nature of his office.
  At the very best he is only a guide to the beautiful object, and he
  must fall back in silence so soon as he has led his company into its
  presence. He may perhaps suggest "the line of vision," or fix the
  point of view, from which we can best hope to do justice to the
  artist's work, by appropriating his intention and comprehending his
  idea; but if <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg014" id=
  "pg014">014</a></span> he seeks to serve the ends of art, he will not
  attempt to do anything more.</p>

  <p>In order to do even this successfully, it is essential that every
  judgment passed should be exclusively ruled by the principles which
  govern art. "Fine art is not real art till it is free"; that is, till
  its value is recognized as lying wholly within itself. And it is not,
  unfortunately, altogether unnecessary to insist that, so far from
  enhancing the value of an artist's work, we only degrade it into mere
  means, subordinate it to uses alien, and therefore antagonistic to
  its perfection, if we try to show that it gives pleasure, or
  refinement, or moral culture. There is no doubt that great poetry has
  all these uses, but the reader can enjoy them only on condition of
  forgetting them; for they are effects that follow the sense of its
  beauty. Art, morality, religion, is each supreme in its own sphere;
  the beautiful is not more beautiful because it is also moral, nor is
  a painting great because its subject is religious. It is true that
  their spheres overlap, and art is never at its best except when it is
  a beautiful representation of the good; nevertheless the points of
  view of the artist and of the ethical teacher are quite different,
  and consequently also the elements within which they work and the
  truth they reveal.</p>

  <p>In attempting, therefore, to discover Robert Browning's philosophy
  of life, I do not pretend that my treatment of him is adequate.
  Browning is, first of all, a poet; it is only as a poet that he can
  be finally judged; and the greatness of a poet is to <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg015" id="pg015">015</a></span> be measured by
  the extent to which his writings are a revelation of what is
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>I undertake a different and a humbler task, conscious of its
  limitations, and aware that I can hardly avoid doing some violence to
  the artist. What I shall seek in the poet's writings is not beauty,
  but truth; and although truth is beautiful, and beauty is truth,
  still the poetic and philosophic interpretation of life are not to be
  confused. Philosophy must separate the matter from the form. Its
  synthesis comes through analysis, and analysis is destructive of
  beauty, as it is of all life. Art, therefore, resists the violence of
  the critical methods of philosophy, and the feud between them, of
  which Plato speaks, will last through all time. The beauty of form
  and the music of speech which criticism destroys, and to which
  philosophy is, at the best, indifferent, are essential to poetry.
  When we leave them out of account we miss the ultimate secret of
  poetry, for they cling to the meaning and penetrate it with their
  charm. Thought and its expression are inseparable in poetry, as they
  never are in philosophy; hence, in the former, the loss of the
  expression is the loss of truth. The pure idea that dwells in a poem
  is suffused in the poetic utterance, as sunshine breaks into beauty
  in the mist, as life beats and blushes in the flesh, or as an
  impassioned thought breathes in a thinker's face.</p>

  <p>But, although art and philosophy are supreme, each in its own
  realm, and neither can be subordinated to the uses of the other, they
  may help each <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg016" id=
  "pg016">016</a></span> other. They are independent, but not rival
  powers of the world of mind. Not only is the interchange of truth
  possible between them; but each may show and give to the other all
  its treasures, and be none the poorer itself. "It is in works of art
  that some nations have deposited the profoundest intuitions and ideas
  of their hearts." Job and Isaiah, Æschylus and Sophocles, Shakespeare
  and Goethe, were first of all poets. Mankind is indebted to them in
  the first place for revealing beauty; but it also owes to them much
  insight into the facts and principles of the moral world. It would be
  an unutterable loss to the ethical thinker and the philosopher, if
  this region were closed against them, so that they could no longer
  seek in the poets the inspiration and light that lead to goodness and
  truth. In our own day, almost above all others, we need the poets for
  these ethical and religious purposes. For the utterances of the
  dogmatic teacher of religion have been divested of much of their
  ancient authority; and the moral philosopher is often regarded either
  as a vendor of commonplaces or as the votary of a discredited
  science, whose primary principles are matter of doubt and debate.
  There are not a few educated Englishmen who find in the poets, and in
  the poets alone, the expression of their deepest convictions
  concerning the profoundest interests of life. They read the poets for
  fresh inspiration, partly, no doubt, because the passion and rapture
  of poetry lull criticism and soothe the questioning spirit into
  acquiescence.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg017" id=
  "pg017">017</a></span>

  <p>But there are further reasons; for the poets of England are
  greater than its moral philosophers; and it is of the nature of the
  poetic art that, while eschewing system, it presents the strife
  between right and wrong in concrete character, and therefore with a
  fulness and truth impossible to the abstract thought of science.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i6">"A poet never dreams:</p>

    <p>We prose folk do: we miss the proper duct</p>

    <p>For thoughts on things unseen."<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>, lxxxviii.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It is true that philosophy endeavours to correct this
  fragmentariness by starting from the unity of the whole. But it can
  never quite get rid of an element of abstraction and reach down to
  the concrete individual.</p>

  <p>The making of character is so complex a process that the poetic
  representation of it, with its subtle suggestiveness, is always more
  complete and realistic than any possible philosophic analysis.
  Science can deal only with aspects and abstractions, and its method
  becomes more and more inadequate as its matter grows more concrete,
  unless it proceeds from the unity in which all the aspects are held
  together. In the case of life, and still more so in that of human
  conduct, the whole must precede the part, and the moral science must,
  therefore, more than any other, partake of the nature of poetry; for
  it must start from living spirit, go from the heart outwards, in
  order to detect the meaning of the actions of man.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg018" id="pg018">018</a></span>

  <p>On this account, poetry is peculiarly helpful to the ethical
  investigator, because it always treats the particular thing as a
  microcosm. It is the great corrective of the onesidedness of science
  with its harsh method of analysis and distinction. It is a witness to
  the unity of man and the world. Every object which art touches into
  beauty, becomes in the very act a whole. The thing that is beautiful
  is always complete, the embodiment of something absolutely valuable,
  the product and the source of love; and the beloved object is all the
  world for the lover&mdash;beyond all praise, because it is above all
  comparison.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Then why not witness, calmly gazing,</p>

    <p>If earth holds aught&mdash;speak truth&mdash;above her?</p>

    <p>Above this tress, and this, I touch</p>

    <p>But cannot praise, I love so much!" <sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Song</i> (Dramatic Lyrics).</p>
  </div>

  <p>This characteristic of the work of art brings with it an important
  practical consequence, because being complete, it appeals to the
  whole man.</p>

  <p>"Poetry," it has been well said, is "the idealized and monumental
  utterance of the deepest feelings." And poetic feelings, it must not
  be forgotten, <i>are</i> deepest; that is, they are the afterglow of
  the fullest activity of a complete soul, and not shallow
  titillations, or surface pleasures, such as the palate knows. Led by
  poetry, the intellect so sees truth that it glows with it, and the
  will is stirred to deeds of heroism. For there is hardly any fact so
  mean, but that when intensified by emotion, it grows poetic; as
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg019" id="pg019">019</a></span> there
  is hardly any man so unimaginative, but that when struck with a great
  sorrow, or moved by a great passion, he is endowed for a moment with
  the poet's speech. A poetic fact, one may almost say, is just any
  fact at its best. Art, it is true, looks at its object through a
  medium, but it always seems its inmost meaning. In Lear, Othello,
  Hamlet, in Falstaff and Touchstone, there is a revelation of the
  inner truth of human life beyond the power of moral science to
  bestow. We do well to seek philosophy in the poets, for though they
  teach only by hints and parables, they nevertheless reflect the
  concrete truth of life, as it is half revealed and half concealed in
  facts. On the other hand, the reflective process of philosophy may
  help poetry; for, as we shall show, there is a near kinship between
  them. Even the critical analyst, while severing element from element,
  may help art and serve the poet's ends, provided he does not in his
  analysis of parts forget the whole. His function, though humble and
  merely preliminary to full poetic enjoyment, is not unimportant. To
  appreciate the grandeur of the unity of the work of art, there must
  be knowledge of the parts combined. It is quite true that the guide
  in the gallery is prone to be too talkative, and there are many who
  can afford to turn the commentator out of doors, especially if he
  moralizes. But, after all, man is not pure sensibility, any more than
  he is pure reason. And the aesthete will not lose if he occasionally
  allows those whom he may think less sensitive than himself to the
  charm of rhythmic phrase, to direct sober <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg020" id="pg020">020</a></span> attention to the
  principles which lie embedded in all great poetry. At the worst, to
  seek for truth in poetry is a protest against the constant tendency
  to read it for the sake of the emotions which it stirs, the tendency
  to make it a refined amusement and nothing more. That is a deeper
  wrong to art than any which the theoretical moralist can inflict. Of
  the two, it is better to read poetry for ethical doctrines than for
  fine sensations; for poetry purifies the passions only when it lifts
  the reader into the sphere of truths that are universal.</p>

  <p>The task of interpreting a poet may be undertaken in different
  ways. One of these, with which we have been made familiar by critics
  of Shakespeare and of Browning himself, is to analyze each poem by
  itself and regard it as the artistic embodiment of some central idea;
  the other is to attempt, without dealing separately with each poem,
  to reach the poet's own point of view, and to reveal the sovereign
  truths which rule his mind. It is this latter way that I shall try to
  follow.</p>

  <p>Such dominant or even despotic thoughts it is possible to discover
  in all our great poets, except perhaps Shakespeare, whose
  universality baffles every classifier. As a rule, the English poets
  have been caught up, and inspired, by the exceeding grandeur of some
  single idea, in whose service they spend themselves with that
  prodigal thrift which finds life in giving it. Such an idea gives
  them a fresh way of looking at the world, so that the world grows
  young again with their new interpretation. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg021" id="pg021">021</a></span> In the highest
  instances, poets may become makers of epochs; they reform as well as
  reveal; for ideas are never dead things, "but grow in the hand that
  grasps them." In them lies the energy of a nation's life, and we
  comprehend that life only when we make clear to ourselves the
  thoughts which inspire it. It is thus true, in the deepest sense,
  that those who make the songs of a people make its history. In all
  true poets there are hints for a larger philosophy of life. But, in
  order to discover it, we must know the truths which dominate them,
  and break into music in their poems.</p>

  <p>Whether it is always possible, and whether it is at any time fair
  to a poet to define the idea which inspires him, I shall not inquire
  at present. No doubt, the interpretation of a poet from first
  principles carries us beyond the limits of art; and by insisting on
  the unity of his work, more may be attributed to him, or demanded
  from him, than he properly owns. To make such a demand is to require
  that poetry should be philosophy as well, which, owing to its method
  of intuition, it can never be. Nevertheless, among English poets
  there is no one who lends himself so easily, or so justly, to this
  way of treatment as Browning. Much of his poetry trembles on the
  verge of the abyss which is supposed to separate art from philosophy;
  and, as I shall try to show, there was in the poet a growing tendency
  to turn the power of dialectic on the pre-suppositions of his art.
  Yet, even Browning puts great difficulties in the way of a critic,
  who seeks to draw a philosophy <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg022"
  id="pg022">022</a></span> of life from his poems. It is not by any
  means an easy task to lift the truths he utters under the stress of
  poetic emotion into the region of placid contemplation, or to connect
  them into a system, by means of the principle from which he makes his
  departure.</p>

  <p>The first of these difficulties arises from the extent and variety
  of his work. He was prodigal of poetic ideas, and wrote for fifty
  years on nature, art, and man, like a magnificent spendthrift of
  spiritual treasures. So great a store of knowledge lay at his hand,
  so real and informed with sympathy, that we can scarcely find any
  great literature which he has not ransacked, any phase of life which
  is not represented in his poems. All kinds of men and women, in every
  station in life, and at every stage of evil and goodness, crowd his
  pages. There are few forms of human character he has not studied, and
  each individual he has so caught at the supreme moment of his life,
  and in the hardest stress of circumstance, that the inmost working of
  his nature is revealed. The wealth is bewildering, and it is hard to
  follow the central thought, "the imperial chord, which steadily
  underlies the accidental mists of music springing thence."<sup>A</sup></p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A second and still graver difficulty lies in the fact that his
  poetry, as he repeatedly insisted, is "always dramatic in principle,
  and so many utterances of so many imaginary persons, not mine."<sup>B</sup> In
  his earlier works, especially, Browning is creative rather than
  reflective, a Maker rather than a Seer; and his <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg023" id="pg023">023</a></span> creations stand
  aloof from him, working out their fate in an outer world. We often
  lose the poet in the imaginative characters, into whom he penetrates
  with his keen artistic intuition, and within whom he lies as a
  necessity revealing itself in their actions and words. It is not easy
  anywhere to separate the elements, so that we can say with certainty,
  "Here I catch the poet, there lies his material." The identification
  of the work and worker is too intimate, and the realization of the
  imaginary personage is too complete.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>B: Pref. to <i>Pauline</i>, 1888.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In regard to the dramatic interpretation of his poetry, Browning
  has manifested a peculiar sensitiveness. In his Preface to
  <i>Pauline</i> and in several of his poems&mdash;notably <i>The
  Mermaid</i>, the <i>House</i>, and the <i>Shop</i>&mdash;he
  explicitly cuts himself free from his work. He knew that direct
  self-revealment on the part of the poet violates the spirit of the
  drama. "With this same key Shakespeare unlocked his heart," said
  Wordsworth; "Did Shakespeare?" characteristically answers Browning,
  "If so, the less Shakespeare he!" And of himself he asks:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Which of you did I enable</p>

    <p class="i2">Once to slip inside my breast,</p>

    <p>There to catalogue and label</p>

    <p class="i2">What I like least, what love best,</p>

    <p>Hope and fear, believe and doubt of,</p>

    <p class="i2">Seek and shun, respect&mdash;deride?</p>

    <p>Who has right to make a rout of</p>

    <p class="i2">Rarities he found inside?"<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>At the Mermaid</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>He repudiates all kinship with Byron and his subjective
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg024" id="pg024">024</a></span> ways,
  and refuses to be made king by the hands which anointed him. "He will
  not give his woes an airing, and has no plague that claims respect."
  Both as man and poet, in virtue of the native, sunny, outer-air
  healthiness of his character, every kind of subjectivity is repulsive
  to him. He hands to his readers "his work, his scroll, theirs to take
  or leave: his soul he proffers not." For him "shop was shop only";
  and though he dealt in gems, and throws</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"You choice of jewels, every one,</p>

    <p>Good, better, best, star, moon, and sun,"<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Shop</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>he still <i>lived</i> elsewhere, and had "stray thoughts and
  fancies fugitive" not meant for the open market. The poems in which
  Browning has spoken without the disguise of another character are
  very few. There are hardly more than two or three of much importance
  which can be considered as directly reflecting his own ideas, namely,
  <i>Christmas Eve</i> and <i>Easter Day, La Saisiaz</i>, and <i>One
  Word More</i>&mdash;unless, spite of the poet's warning, we add
  <i>Pauline</i>.</p>

  <p>But, although the dramatic element in Browning's poetry renders it
  difficult to construct his character from his works, while this is
  comparatively easy in the case of Wordsworth or Byron; and although
  it throws a shade of uncertainty on every conclusion we might draw as
  to any specific doctrine held by him, still Browning lives in a
  certain atmosphere, and looks at his characters through a medium,
  whose subtle influence makes all his work indisputably <i>his</i>.
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg025" id="pg025">025</a></span> The
  light he throws on his men and women is not the unobtrusive light of
  day, which reveals objects, but not itself. Though a true dramatist,
  he is not objective like Shakespeare and Scott, whose characters seem
  never to have had an author. The reader feels, rather, that Browning
  himself attends him through all the sights and wonders of the world
  of man; he never escapes the sense of the presence of the poet's
  powerful personality, or of the great convictions on which he has
  based his life. Browning has, at bottom, only one way of looking at
  the world, and one way of treating his objects; one point of view,
  and one artistic method. Nay, further, he has one supreme interest,
  which he pursues everywhere with a constancy shown by hardly any
  other poet; and, in consequence, his works have a unity and a certain
  originality, which make them in many ways a unique contribution to
  English literature.</p>

  <p>This characteristic, which no critic has missed, and which
  generally goes by the name of "the metaphysical element" in his
  poetry, makes it the more imperative to form a clear view of his
  ruling conceptions. No poet, least of all a dramatic poet, goes about
  seeking concrete vehicles for ready-made ideas, or attempts to dress
  a philosophy in metaphors; and Browning, as an artist, is interested
  first of all in the object which he renders beautiful for its own
  sole sake, and not in any abstract idea it illustrates. Still, it is
  true in a peculiar sense in his case, that the eye of the poet brings
  with it what it sees. He is, as a rule, conscious of no theory, and
  does not <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg026" id=
  "pg026">026</a></span> construct a poem for its explication; he
  rather strikes his ideas out of his material, as the sculptor reveals
  the breathing life in the stone. Nevertheless, it may be shown that a
  theory rules him from behind, and that profound convictions arise in
  the heart and rush along the blood at the moment of creation, using
  his soul as an instrument of expression to his age and people.</p>

  <p>Of no English poet, except Shakespeare, can we say with
  approximate truth that he is the poet of all times. The subjective
  breath of their own epoch dims the mirror which they hold up to
  nature. Missing by their limitation the highest universality, they
  can only be understood in their setting. It adds but little to our
  knowledge of Shakespeare's work to regard him as the great
  Elizabethan; there is nothing temporary in his dramas, except petty
  incidents and external trappings&mdash;so truly did he dwell amidst
  the elements constituting man in every age and clime. But this cannot
  be said of any other poet, not even of Chaucer or Spenser, far less
  of Milton, or Pope or Wordsworth. In their case, the artistic form
  and the material, the idea and its expression, the beauty and the
  truth, are to some extent separable. We can distinguish in Milton
  between the Puritanic theology which is perishable, and the art whose
  beauty can never pass away. The former fixes his kinship with his own
  age, gives him a definite place in the evolution of English life; the
  latter is independent of time, a thing which has supreme worth in
  itself.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg027" id=
  "pg027">027</a></span>

  <p>Nor can it be doubted that the same holds good of Browning. He
  also is ruled by the ideas of his own age. It may not be altogether
  possible for us, "who are partners of his motion and mixed up with
  his career," to allow for the influence of these ideas, and to
  distinguish between that which is evanescent and that which is
  permanent in his work; still I must try to do so; for it is the
  condition of comprehending him, and of appropriating the truth and
  beauty he came to reveal. And if his nearness to ourselves makes this
  more difficult, it also makes it more imperative. For there is no
  doubt that, with Carlyle, he is the interpreter of our time,
  reflecting its confused strength and chaotic wealth. He is the high
  priest of our age, standing at the altar for us, and giving utterance
  to our needs and aspirations, our fears and faith. By understanding
  him, we shall, to some degree, understand ourselves and the power
  which is silently moulding us to its purposes.</p>

  <p>It is because I thus regard Browning as not merely a poet but a
  prophet, that I think I am entitled to seek in him, as in Isaiah or
  Aeschylus, a solution, or a help to the solution, of the problems
  that press upon us when we reflect upon man, his place in the world
  and his destiny. He has given us indirectly, and as a poet gives, a
  philosophy of life; he has interpreted the world anew in the light of
  a dominant idea; and it will be no little gain if we can make clear
  to ourselves those constitutive principles on which his view of the
  world rests.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg028" id=

  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>, xliv.</p>
  </div>

  <p>No English poet has spoken more impressively than Browning on the
  weightier matters of morality and religion, or sought with more
  earnestness to meet the difficulties which arise when we try to
  penetrate to their ultimate principles. His way of poetry is, I
  think, fundamentally different from that of any other of our great
  writers. He often seems to be roused into speech, rather by the
  intensity of his spiritual convictions than by the subtle incitements
  of poetic sensibility. His convictions caught fire, and truth became
  beauty for him; not beauty, truth, as with Keats or Shelley. He is
  swayed by ideas, rather than by sublime moods. Beneath the endless
  variety of his poems, there are permanent principles, or <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg029" id="pg029">029</a></span> "colligating
  conceptions," as science calls them; and although these are expressed
  by the way of emotion, they are held by him with all the resources of
  his reason.</p>

  <p>His work, though intuitive and perceptive as to form, "gaining God
  by first leap" as all true art must do, leaves the impression, when
  regarded as a whole, of an articulated system. It is a view of man's
  life and destiny that can be maintained, not only during the
  impassioned moods of poetry, but in the very presence of criticism
  and doubt. His faith, like Pompilia's, is held fast "despite the
  plucking fiend." He has given to us something more than intuitive
  glimpses into, the mysteries of man's character. Throughout his life
  he held up the steady light of an optimistic conception of the world,
  and by its means injected new vigour into English ethical thought. In
  his case, therefore, it is not an immaterial question, but one almost
  forced upon us, whether we are to take his ethical doctrine and
  inspiring optimism as valid truths, or to regard them merely as
  subjective opinions held by a religious poet. Are they creations of a
  powerful imagination, and nothing more? Do they give to the hopes and
  aspirations that rise so irrepressibly in the heart of man anything
  better than an appearance of validity, which will prove illusory the
  moment the cold light of critical inquiry is turned upon them?</p>

  <p>It is to this unity of his work that I would attribute, in the
  main, the impressiveness of his <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg030"
  id="pg030">030</a></span> deliverances on morality and religion. And
  this unity justifies us, I think, in applying to Browning's view of
  life methods of criticism that would be out of place with any other
  English poet. It is one of his unique characteristics, as already
  hinted, that he has endeavoured to give us a complete and reasoned
  view of the ethical nature of man, and of his relation to the
  world&mdash;has sought, in fact, to establish a philosophy of life.
  In his case, not without injustice, it is true, but with less
  injustice than in the case of any other poet, we may disregard,
  <i>for our purposes</i>, the artistic method of his thought, and lay
  stress on its content only. He has a right to a place amongst
  philosophers, as Plato has to a place amongst poets. There is such
  deliberate earnestness and systematic consistency in his teaching,
  that Hegel can scarcely be said to have maintained that "The Rational
  is the Real" with greater intellectual tenacity, than Browning held
  to his view of life. He sought, in fact, to establish an Idealism;
  and that Idealism, like Kant's and Fichte's, has its last basis in
  the moral consciousness.</p>

  <p>But, even if it be considered that it is not altogether just to
  apply these critical tests to the poet's teaching, and to make him
  pay the penalty for assuming a place amongst philosophers, it is
  certain that what he says of man's spiritual life cannot be rightly
  valued, till it is regarded in the light of his guiding principles.
  We shall miss much of what is best in him, even as a poet, if, for
  instance, we <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg031" id=
  "pg031">031</a></span> regard his treatment of love merely as the
  expression of elevated passion, or his optimism as based upon mere
  hope. Love was to him rather an indwelling element in the world,
  present, like power, in everything.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"From the first, Power was&mdash;I knew.</p>

    <p class="i2">Life has made clear to me</p>

    <p>That, strive but for closer view,</p>

    <p class="i2">Love were as plain to see." <sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    A: <i>Reverie&mdash;Asolando</i>.
  </div>

  <p>Love yielded to him, as Reason did to Hegel, a fundamental
  exposition of the nature of things. Or, to express the same thing in
  another way, it was a deliberate hypothesis, which he sought to apply
  to facts and to test by their means, almost in the same manner as
  that in which natural science applies and tests its principles.</p>

  <p>That Browning's ethical and religious ideas were for him something
  different from, and perhaps more than, mere poetic sentiments, will,
  I believe, be scarcely denied. That he held a deliberate theory, and
  held it with greater and greater difficulty as he became older, and
  as his dialectical tendencies grew and threatened to wreck his
  artistic freedom, is evident to any one who regards his work as a
  whole. But it will not be admitted so readily that anything other
  than harm can issue from an attempt to deal with him as if he were a
  philosopher. Even if it be allowed that he held and expressed a
  definite theory, will it retain any value if we take it out of the
  region of poetry and impassioned religious faith, into the
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg032" id="pg032">032</a></span>
  frigid zone of philosophical inquiry? Could any one maintain, apart
  from the intoxication of religious and poetic sentiment, that the
  essence of existence is love? As long as we remain within the realm
  of imagination, it may be argued, we may find in our poet's great
  sayings both solacement and strength, both rest and an impulse
  towards higher moral endeavour; but if we seek to treat them as
  theories of facts, and turn upon them the light of the understanding,
  will they not inevitably prove to be hallucinations? Poetry, we
  think, has its own proper place and function. It is an invaluable
  anodyne to the cark and care of reflective thought; an opiate which,
  by steeping the critical intellect in slumber, sets the soul free to
  rise on the wings of religious faith. But reason breaks the spell;
  and the world of poetry, and religion&mdash;a world which to them is
  always beautiful and good with God's presence&mdash;becomes a system
  of inexorable laws, dead, mechanical, explicable in strict truth, as
  an equipoise of constantly changing forms of energy.</p>

  <p>There is, at the present time, a widespread belief that we had
  better keep poetry and religion beyond the reach of critical
  investigation, if we set any store by them. Faith and reason are
  thought to be finally divorced. It is an article of the common creed
  that every attempt which the world has made to bring them together
  has resulted in denial, or at the best in doubt, regarding all
  supersensuous facts. The one condition of leading a full life, of
  maintaining a living relation between ourselves and both the
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg033" id="pg033">033</a></span>
  spiritual and material elements of our existence, is to make our
  lives an alternating rhythm of the head and heart, to distinguish
  with absolute clearness between the realm of reason and that of
  faith.</p>

  <p>Now, such an assumption would be fatal to any attempt like the
  present, to find truth in poetry; and I must, therefore, try to meet
  it before entering upon a statement and criticism of Browning's view
  of life. I cannot admit that the difficulties of placing the facts of
  man's spiritual life on a rational basis are so great as to justify
  the assertion that there is no such basis, or that it is not
  discoverable by man. Surely, it is unreasonable to make intellectual
  death the condition of spiritual life. If such a condition were
  imposed on man, it must inevitably defeat its own purpose; for man
  cannot possibly continue to live a divided life, and persist in
  believing that for which his reason knows no defence. We must, in the
  long run, either rationalize our faith in morality and religion, or
  abandon them as illusions. And we should at least hesitate to deny
  that reason&mdash;in spite of its apparent failure in the past to
  justify our faith in the principles of spiritual life&mdash;may yet,
  as it becomes aware of its own nature and the might which dwells in
  it, find beauty and goodness, nay, God himself, in the world. We
  should at least hesitate to condemn man to choose between
  irreflective ignorance and irreligion, or to lock the intellect and
  the highest emotions of our nature and principles of our life, in a
  mortal struggle. Poetry and religion may, after all, be truer then
  prose, and have something to <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg034"
  id="pg034">034</a></span> tell the world that science, which is often
  ignorant of its own limits, cannot teach.</p>

  <p>The failure of philosophy in the past, even if it were as complete
  as is believed by persons ignorant of its history, is no argument
  against its success in the future. Such persons have never known that
  the world of thought like that of action makes a stepping stone of
  its dead self. He who presumes to decide what passes the power of
  man's thought, or to prescribe absolute limits to human knowledge, is
  rash, to say the least; and he has neither caught the most important
  of the lessons of modern science, nor been lifted to the level of its
  inspiration. For science has done one thing greater than to unlock
  the secrets of nature. It has revealed something of the might of
  reason, and given new grounds for the faith, which in all ages has
  inspired the effort to know,&mdash;the faith that the world is an
  intelligible structure, meant to be penetrated by the thought of man.
  Can it be that nature is an "open secret," but that man, and he
  alone, must remain an enigma? Or does he not rather bear within
  himself the key to every problem which he solves, and is it not
  <i>his</i> thought which penetrates the secrets of nature? The
  success of science, in reducing to law the most varied and apparently
  unconnected facts, should dispel any suspicion which attaches to the
  attempt to gather these laws under still wider ones, and to interpret
  the world in the light of the highest principles. And this is
  precisely what poetry and religion and philosophy do, each in its own
  way. They carry <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg035" id=
  "pg035">035</a></span> the work of the sciences into wider regions,
  and that, as I shall try to show, by methods which, in spite of many
  external differences, are fundamentally at one with those which the
  sciences employ.</p>

  <p>There is only one way of giving the quietus to the metaphysics of
  poets and philosophers, and of showing the futility of a philosophy
  of life, or of any scientific explanation of religion and morals. It
  is to show that there is some radical absurdity in the very attempt.
  Till this is done, the human mind will not give up problems of
  weighty import, however hard it may be to solve them. The world
  refused to believe Socrates when he pronounced a science of nature
  impossible, and centuries of failure did not break man's courage.
  Science, it is true, has given up some problems as insoluble; it will
  not now try to construct a perpetually moving machine, or to square
  the circle. But it has given them up, not because they are difficult,
  but because they are unreasonable tasks. The problems have a surd or
  irrational element in them; and to solve them would be to bring
  reason into collision with itself.</p>

  <p>Now, whatever may be the difficulties of establishing a theory of
  life, or a philosophy, it has never been shown to be an unreasonable
  task to attempt it. One might, on the contrary, expect, <i>prima
  facie</i>, that in a world progressively proved to be intelligible to
  man, man himself would be no exception. It is impossible that the
  "light in him should be darkness," or that the thought which reveals
  the order of the world should be itself chaotic.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg036" id="pg036">036</a></span>

  <p>The need for philosophy is just the ultimate form of the need for
  knowledge; and the truths which philosophy brings to light are
  implied in every rational explanation of things. The only choice we
  can have is between a conscious metaphysics and an unconscious one,
  between hypotheses which we have examined and whose limitations we
  know, and hypotheses which rule us from behind, as pure prejudices
  do. It is because of this that the empiric is so dogmatic, and the
  ignorant man so certain of the truth of his opinion. They do not know
  their postulates, nor are they aware that there is no interpretation
  of an object which does not finally point to a theory of being. We
  understand no joint or ligament, except in relation to the whole
  organism, and no fact, or event, except by finding a place for it in
  the context of our experience. The history of the pebble can be
  given, only in the light of the story of the earth, as it is told by
  the whole of geology. We must begin very far back, and bring our
  widest principles to bear upon the particular thing, if we wish
  really to know what it is. It is a law that explains, and laws are
  always universal. All our knowledge, even the most broken and
  inconsistent, streams from some fundamental conception, in virtue of
  which all the variety of objects constitute one world, one orderly
  kosmos, even to the meanest mind. It is true that the central
  thought, be it rich or poor, must, like the sun's light, be broken
  against particular facts. But there is no need of forgetting the real
  source of knowledge, or of deeming that its progress is a
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg037" id="pg037">037</a></span>
  synthesis without law, or an addition of fact to fact without any
  guiding principles.</p>

  <p>Now, it is the characteristic of poetry and philosophy that they
  keep alive our consciousness of these primary, uniting principles.
  They always dwell in the presence of the idea which makes their
  object <i>one</i>. To them the world is always, and necessarily, a
  harmonious whole, as it is also to the religious spirit. It is
  because of this that the universe is a thing of beauty for the poet,
  a revelation of God's goodness to the devout soul, and a
  manifestation of absolute reason to the philosopher. Art, religion,
  and philosophy fail or flourish together. The age of prose and
  scepticism appears when the sense of the presence of the whole in the
  particular facts of the world and of life has been dulled. And there
  is a necessity in this; for if the conception of the world as a whole
  is held to be impossible, if philosophy is a futility, then poetry
  will be a vain sentiment and religion a delusion.</p>

  <p>Nor will the failure of thought, when once demonstrated in these
  upper regions, be confined to them. On the contrary, it will spread
  downwards to science and ordinary knowledge, as mountain mists blot
  out the valleys. For every synthesis of fact to fact, every attempt
  to know, however humble and limited, is inspired by a secret faith in
  the unity of the world. Each of the sciences works within its own
  region, and colligates its details in the light of its own
  hypothesis; and all the sciences taken together presuppose the
  presence in the world of a principle <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg038" id="pg038">038</a></span> that binds it into an orderly
  totality. Scientific explorers know that they are all working towards
  the same centre. And, ever and anon, as the isolated thinker presses
  home his own hypothesis, he finds his thought beating on the limits
  of his science, and suggesting some wider hypothesis. The walls that
  separate the sciences are wearing thin, and at times light penetrates
  from one to the other. So that to their votaries, at least, the faith
  is progressively justified, that there is a meeting point for the
  sciences, a central truth in which the dispersed rays will again be
  gathered together. In fact, all the sciences are working together
  under the guidance of a principle common to them all, although it may
  not be consciously known and no attempt is made to define it. In
  science, as in philosophy and art and religion, there is a principle
  of unity, which, though latent, is really prior to all explanation of
  particular matters of fact.</p>

  <p>In truth, man has only one way of knowing. There is no fundamental
  difference between scientific and philosophic procedure. We always
  light up facts by means of general laws. The fall of the stone was a
  perfect enigma, a universally unintelligible bit of experience, till
  the majestic imagination of Newton conceived the idea of universal
  gravitation. Wherever mind successfully invades the realm of chaos,
  poetry, the sense of the whole, comes first. There is the intuitive
  flash, the penetrative glimpse, got no one knows exactly
  whence&mdash;though we do know that it comes neither from
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg039" id="pg039">039</a></span> the
  dead facts nor from the vacant region of <i>a priori</i> thought, but
  somehow from the interaction of both these elements of knowledge.
  After the intuitive flash comes the slow labour of proof, the
  application of the principle to details. And that application
  transforms both the principle and the details, so that the former is
  enriched with content and the latter are made intelligible&mdash;a
  veritable conquest and valid possession for mankind. And in this
  labour of proof, science and philosophy alike take their share.</p>

  <p>Philosophy may be said to come midway between poetry and science,
  and to partake of the nature of both. On the one side it deals, like
  poetry, with ideals of knowledge, and announces truths which it does
  not completely verify; on the other, it leaves to science the task of
  articulating its principles in facts, though it begins the
  articulation itself. It reveals subsidiary principles, and is, at the
  same time, a witness for the unity of the categories of science. We
  may say, if we wish, that its principles are mere hypotheses. But so
  are the ideas which underlie the most practical of the sciences; so
  is every forecast of genius by virtue of which knowledge is extended;
  so is every principle of knowledge not completely worked out. To say
  that philosophy is hypothetical implies no charge, other than that
  which can be levelled, in the same sense, against the most solid body
  of scientific knowledge in the world. The fruitful question in each
  case alike is, how far, if <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg040" id=
  "pg040">040</a></span> at all, does the hypothesis enable us to
  understand particular facts.</p>

  <p>The more careful of our scientific thinkers are well aware of the
  limits under which they work and of the hypothetical character of
  their results. "I take Euclidean space, and the existence of material
  particles and elemental energy for granted," says the physicist;
  "deny them, and I am helpless; grant them, and I shall establish
  quantitative relations between the different forms of this elemental
  energy, and make it tractable and tame to man's uses. All I teach
  depends upon my hypothesis. In it is the secret of all the power I
  wield. I do not pretend to say what this elemental energy is. I make
  no declaration regarding the actual nature of things; and all
  questions as to the ultimate origin or final destination of the world
  are beyond the scope of my inquiry. I am ruled by my hypothesis; I
  regard phenomena <i>from my point of view</i>; and my right to do so
  I substantiate by the practical and theoretical results which
  follow." The language of geology, chemistry, zoology, and even
  mathematics is the same. They all start from a hypothesis; they are
  all based on an imaginative conception, and in this sense their
  votaries are poets, who see the unity of being throb in the
  particular fact.</p>

  <p>Now, so far as the particular sciences are concerned, I presume
  that no one will deny the supreme power of these colligating ideas.
  The sciences do not grow by a process of empiricism, which rambles
  tentatively and blindly from fact to fact, unguided of <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg041" id="pg041">041</a></span> any hypothesis.
  But if they do not, if, on the contrary, each science is ruled by its
  own hypothesis, and uses that hypothesis to bind its facts together,
  then the question arises, are there no wider colligating principles
  amongst these hypotheses themselves? Are the sciences independent of
  each other, or is their independence only surface appearance? This is
  the question which philosophy asks, and the sciences themselves by
  their progress suggest a positive answer to it.</p>

  <p>The knowledge of the world which the sciences are building is not
  a chaotic structure. By their apparently independent efforts, the
  outer kosmos is gradually reproduced in the mind of man, and the
  temple of truth is silently rising. We may not as yet be able to
  connect wing with wing, or to declare definitely the law of the
  whole. The logical order of the hypotheses of the various sciences,
  the true connection of these categories of constructive thought, may
  yet be uncertain. But, still, there <i>is</i> such an order and
  connection: the whole building has its plan, which becomes more and
  more intelligible as it approaches to its completion. Beneath all the
  differences, there are fundamental principles which give to human
  thought a definite unity of movement and direction. There are
  architectonic conceptions which are guiding, not only the different
  sciences, but all the modes of thought of an age. There are
  intellectual media, "working hypotheses," by means of which
  successive centuries observe all that they see; and these
  far-reaching constructive principles <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg042" id="pg042">042</a></span> divide the history of mankind into
  distinct stages. In a word, there are dynasties of great ideas, such
  as the idea of development in our own day; and these successively
  ascend the throne of mind, and hold a sway over human thought which
  is well-nigh absolute.</p>

  <p>Now, if this is so, is it certain that all <i>knowledge</i> of
  these ruling conceptions is impossible? In other words, is the
  attempt to construct a philosophy absurd? To say that it is, to deny
  the possibility of catching any glimpse of those regulative ideas,
  which determine the main tendencies of human thought, is to place the
  supreme directorate of the human intelligence in the hands of a
  necessity which, <i>for us</i>, is blind. For, an order that is
  hidden is equivalent to chance, so far as knowledge is concerned; and
  if we believe it to exist, we do so in the face of the fact that all
  we see, and all we <i>can</i> see, is the opposite of order, namely
  lawlessness. Human knowledge, on this view, would be subjected to law
  in its details and compartments, but to disorder as a whole. Thinking
  men would be organized into regiments; but the regiments would not
  constitute an army, nor would there be any unity of movement in the
  attack on the realm of ignorance.</p>

  <p>But, such is not the conclusion to which the study of human
  history leads, especially when we observe its movements on a large
  scale. On the contrary, it is found that history falls into great
  epochs, each of which has its own peculiar characteristics. Ages,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg043" id="pg043">043</a></span> as
  well as nations and individuals, have features of their own, special
  and definite modes of thinking and acting. The movement of thought in
  each age has its own direction, which is determined by some
  characteristic and fundamental idea, that fulfils for it the part of
  a working hypothesis in a particular science. It is the prerogative
  of the greatest leaders of thought in an age to catch a glimpse of
  this ruling idea when it first makes its appearance; and it is their
  function, not only to discover it, but also to reveal it to others.
  And, in this way, they are at once the exponents of their time, and
  its prophets. They reveal that which is already a latent but active
  power&mdash;"a tendency"; but they reveal it to a generation which
  will see the truth for itself, only after the potency which lies in
  it has manifested itself in national institutions and habits of
  thought and action. <i>After</i> the prophets have left us, we
  believe what they have said; as long as they are with us, they are
  voices crying in the wilderness.</p>

  <p>Now, these great ideas, these harmonies of the world of mind,
  first strike upon the ear of the poet. They seem to break into the
  consciousness of man by the way of emotion. They possess the seer; he
  is divinely mad, and he utters words whose meaning passes his own
  calmer comprehension. What we find in Goethe, we find also in a
  manner in Browning: an insight which is also foresight, a dim and
  partial consciousness of the truth about to be, sending its light
  before it, and anticipating all systematic reflection. It is an
  insight which appears <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg044" id=
  "pg044">044</a></span> to be independent of all method; but it is in
  nature, though not in sweep and expanse, akin to the intuitive leap
  by which the scientific explorer lights upon his new hypothesis. We
  can find no other law for it, than that sensitiveness to the beauty
  and truth hidden in facts, which much reflection on them generates
  for genius. For these great minds the "muddy vesture" is worn thin by
  thought, and they hear the immortal music.</p>

  <p>The poet soon passes his glowing torch into the hands of the
  philosopher. After Aeschylus and Sophocles, come Plato and Aristotle.
  The intuitive flash grows into a fixed light, which rules the day.
  The great idea, when reflected upon, becomes a system. When the light
  of such an idea is steadily held on human affairs, it breaks into
  endless forms of beauty and truth. The content of the idea is
  gradually evolved; hypotheses spring out of it, which are accepted as
  principles, rule the mind of an age, and give it its work and its
  character. In this way, Hobbes and Locke laid down, or at least
  defined, the boundaries within which moved the thought of the
  eighteenth century; and no one acquainted with the poetic and
  philosophic thought of Germany, from Lessing to Goethe and from Kant
  to Hegel, can fail to find therein the source and spring of the
  constitutive principles of our own intellectual, social, political,
  and religious life. The virtues and the vices of the aristocracy of
  the world of mind penetrate downwards. The works of the poets and
  philosophers, so far from being filled with <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg045" id="pg045">045</a></span> impracticable
  dreams, are repositories of great suggestions which the world adopts
  for its guidance. The poets and philosophers lay no railroads and
  invent no telephones; but they, nevertheless, bring about that
  attitude towards nature, man and God, and generate those moods of the
  general mind, from which issue, not only the scientific, but also the
  social, political and religious forces of the age.</p>

  <p>It is mainly on this account that I cannot treat the supreme
  utterances of Browning lightly, or think it an idle task to try to
  connect them into a philosophy of life. In his optimism of love, in
  his supreme confidence in man's destiny and sense of the infinite
  height of the moral horizon of humanity, in his courageous faith in
  the good, and his profound conviction of the evanescence of evil,
  there lies a vital energy whose inspiring power we are yet destined
  to feel. Until a spirit kindred to his own arises, able to push the
  battle further into the same region, much of the practical task of
  the age that is coming will consist in living out in detail the ideas
  to which he has given expression.</p>

  <p>I contend, then, not merely for a larger charity, but for a truer
  view of the facts of history than is evinced by those who set aside
  the poets and philosophers as mere dreamers, and conceive that the
  sciences alone occupy the region of valid thought in all its extent.
  There is a universal brotherhood of which all who think are members.
  Not only do they all contribute to man's victory over his environment
  and himself, but they contribute in a manner <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg046" id="pg046">046</a></span> which is
  substantially the same. There are many points of superficial
  distinction between the processes of philosophy and science, and
  between both and the method of poetry; but the inner movement, if one
  may so express it, is identical in all. It is time to have done with
  the notion that philosophers occupy a transcendent region beyond
  experience, or spin spiritual cocoons by <i>a priori</i> methods, and
  with the view that scientific men are mere empirics, building their
  structures from below by an <i>a posteriori</i> way of thought,
  without the help of any ruling conceptions. All alike endeavour to
  interpret experience, but none of them get their principles from
  it.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i10">"But, friends,</p>

    <p>Truth is within ourselves; it takes no rise</p>

    <p>From outward things, whate'er you may believe."</p>
  </div>

  <p>There is room and need for the higher synthesis of philosophy and
  poetry, as well as for the more palpable and, at the same time, more
  narrow colligating conceptions of the systematic sciences. The
  quantitative relations between material objects, which are
  investigated by mathematics and physics, do not exhaust the realm of
  the knowable, so as to leave no place for the poet's, or the
  philosopher's view of the world. The scientific investigator who,
  like Mr. Tyndall, so far forgets the limitations of his province as
  to use his natural data as premises for religious or irreligious
  conclusions, is as illogical as the popular preacher, who attacks
  scientific conclusions because they are not consistent with his
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg047" id="pg047">047</a></span>
  theological presuppositions. Looking only at their primary aspects,
  we cannot say that religious presuppositions and the scientific
  interpretation of facts are either consistent or inconsistent: they
  are simply different. Their harmony or discord can come only when the
  higher principles of philosophy have been fully developed, and when
  the departmental ideas of the various sciences are organized into a
  view of the world as a whole. And this is a task which has not as yet
  been accomplished. The forces from above and below have not met. When
  they do meet, they will assuredly find that they are friends, and not
  foes. For philosophy can articulate its supreme conception only by
  interaction with the sciences; and, on the other hand, the progress
  of science, and the effectiveness of its division of labour, are
  ultimately conditioned by its sensitiveness to the hints, given by
  poets and philosophers, of those wider principles in virtue of which
  the world is conceived as a unity. There are many, indeed, who cannot
  see the wood for the trees, as there are others who cannot see the
  trees for the wood. Carlyle cared nothing though science were able to
  turn a sunbeam on its axis; Ruskin sees little in the advance of
  invention except more slag-hills. And scientific men have not been
  slow to return with interest the scorn of the moralists. But a more
  comprehensive view of the movement of human knowledge will show that
  none labour in vain. For its movement is that of a thing which
  <i>grows</i>! and in growth there is always movement <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg048" id="pg048">048</a></span> towards both
  unity and difference. Science, in pursuing truth into greater and
  greater detail, is constrained by its growing consciousness of the
  unlimited wealth of its material, to divide and isolate its interests
  more and more; and thus, at the same time, the need for the poets and
  philosophers is growing deeper, their task is becoming more difficult
  of achievement, and a greater triumph in so far as it is achieved.
  Both science and philosophy are working towards a more concrete view
  of the world as an articulated whole. If we cannot quite say with
  Browning that "poets never dream," we may yet admit with gratitude
  that their dreams are an inspiration.</p>

  <p>And side by side with the poetry that grasps the truth in

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>B: <i>The Problem of Philosophy at the Present Time</i>, by
    Professor Caird.</p>
  </div>

  <p>So far we have spoken of the function of philosophy <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg049" id="pg049">049</a></span> in the
  interpretation of the phenomena of the outer world. It bears witness
  to the unity of knowledge, and strives by the constructive criticism
  of the categories of science to render that unity explicit. Its
  function is, no doubt, valid and important, for it is evident that
  man cannot rest content with fragmentary knowledge. But still, it
  might be objected that it is premature at present to endeavour to
  formulate that unity. Physics, chemistry, biology, and the other
  sciences, while they necessarily presuppose the unity of knowledge,
  and attempt in their own way and in their own sphere to discover it,
  are making very satisfactory headway without raising any of the
  desperate questions of metaphysics as to its ultimate nature. For
  them it is not likely to matter for a long time to come whether
  Optimism or Pessimism, Materialism or Idealism, or none of them, be
  true. In any case the principles they establish are valid. Physical
  relations always remain true; "ginger will be hot i' the mouth, and
  there will be more cakes and ale." It is only when the sciences break
  down beneath the weight of knowledge and prove themselves inadequate,
  that it becomes necessary or advantageous to seek for more
  comprehensive principles. At present is it not better to persevere in
  the way of science, than to be seduced from it by the desire to solve
  ultimate problems, which, however reasonable and pressing, seem to be
  beyond our power to answer?</p>

  <p>Such reasonings are not convincing; still, so far as natural
  science is concerned, they seem to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg050" id="pg050">050</a></span> indicate that there might be no
  great harm in ignoring, for a time, its dependence on the wider
  aspects of human thought. There is no department of nature so
  limited, but that it may more than satisfy the largest ambition of
  the individual for knowledge. But this attitude of indifference to
  ultimate questions is liable at any moment to be disturbed.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Bishop Blougram's Apology.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>Amongst the facts of our experience which cry most loudly for some
  kind of solution, are those of our own inner life. We are in pressing
  need of a "working hypothesis" wherewith to understand ourselves, as
  well as of a theory which will explain the revolution of the planets,
  or the structure of an oyster. And this self of ours intrudes
  everywhere. It is only by resolutely shutting our eyes, that we can
  forget the part it plays even in the outer world of natural science.
  So active is it in the constitution of things, so dependent is their
  nature on the nature of our knowing faculties, that scientific men
  themselves admit that their surest <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg051" id="pg051">051</a></span> results are only hypothetical.
  Their truth depends on laws of thought which natural science does not
  investigate.</p>

  <p>But quite apart from this doctrine of the relativity of knowledge,
  which is generally first acknowledged and then ignored, every man,
  the worst and the best alike, is constrained to take some
  <i>practical</i> attitude towards his fellows. Man is never alone
  with nature, and the connections with his fellows which sustain his
  intelligent life, are liable to bring him into trouble, if they are
  not to some degree understood.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"There's power in me," said Bishop Blougram, "and will to
    dominate</p>

    <p>Which I must exercise, they hurt me else."</p>
  </div>

  <p>The impulse to know is only a phase of the more general impulse to
  act and to be. The specialist's devotion to his science is his answer
  to a demand, springing from his practical need, that he realize
  himself through action. He does not construct his edifice of
  knowledge, as the bird is supposed to build its nest, without any
  consciousness of an end to be attained thereby. Even if, like
  Lessing, he values the pursuit of truth for its own sake, still what
  stings him into effort is the sense that in truth only can he find
  the means of satisfying and realizing himself. Beneath all man's
  activities, as their very spring and source, there lies some dim
  conception of an end to be attained. This is his moral consciousness,
  which no neglect will utterly suppress. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg052" id="pg052">052</a></span> All human effort,
  the effort to know like every other, conceals within it a reference
  to some good, conceived at the time as supreme and complete; and
  this, in turn, contains a theory both of man's self and of the
  universe on which he must impress his image. Every man must have his
  philosophy of life, simply because he must act; though, in many
  cases, that philosophy may be latent and unconscious, or, at least,
  not a definite object of reflection. The most elementary question
  directed at his moral consciousness will at once elicit the universal
  element. We cannot ask whether an action be right or wrong without
  awakening all the echoes of metaphysics. As there is no object on the
  earth's surface whose equilibrium is not fixed by its relation to the
  earth's centre, so the most elementary moral judgment, the simplest
  choice, the most irrational vagaries of a will calling itself free
  and revelling in its supposed lawlessness, are dominated by the
  conception of a universal good. Everything that a man does is an
  attempt to articulate his view of this good, with a particular
  content. Hence, man as a moral agent is always the centre of his own
  horizon, and stands right beneath the zenith. Little as he may be
  aware of it, his relation between himself and his supreme good is
  direct. And he orders his whole world from his point of view, just as
  he regards East and West as meeting at the spot on which he stands.
  Whether he will or not, he cannot but regard the universe of men and
  objects as the instrument of his purposes. He extracts <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg053" id="pg053">053</a></span> all its interest
  and meaning from himself. His own shadow falls upon it all. If he is
  selfish, that is, if he interprets the self that is in him as
  vulturous, then the whole outer world and his fellow-men fall for him
  into the category of carrion, or not-carrion. If he knows himself as
  spirit, as the energy of love or reason, if the prime necessity he
  recognizes within himself is the necessity to be good, then the
  universe becomes for him an instrument wherewith moral character is
  evolved. In all cases alike, his life-work is an effort to rob the
  world of its alien character, and to translate it into terms of
  himself.</p>

  <p>We are in the habit of fixing a chasm between a man's deeds and
  his metaphysical, moral, and religious creed; and even of thinking
  that he can get on "in a sufficiently prosperous manner," without any
  such creed. Can we not digest without a theory of peptics, or do
  justice without constructing an ideal state? The truest answer,
  though it is an answer easily misunderstood, is that we cannot. In
  the sphere of morality, at least, action, depends on knowledge:
  Socrates was right in saying that virtuous conduct ignorant of its
  end is accidental. Man's action, so far as it is good or evil, is
  shot through and through with his intelligence. And once we clearly
  distinguish between belief and profession, between the motives which
  really impel our actions and the psychological account of them with
  which we may deceive ourselves and others, we shall be obliged to
  confess that we always act our creed. A man's conduct, just because
  he is man, is generated by his view of himself and <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg054" id="pg054">054</a></span> his world. He who
  cheats his neighbour believes in tortuosity, and, as Carlyle says,
  has the Supreme Quack for his God. No one ever acted without some
  dim, though perhaps foolish enough, half-belief that the world was at
  his back; whether he plots good or evil he always has God as an
  accomplice. And this is why character cannot be really bettered by
  any peddling process. Moralists and preachers are right in insisting
  on the need of a new life, that is, of a new principle, as the basis
  of any real improvement; and such a principle necessarily carries in
  it a new attitude towards men, and a new interpretation of the moral
  agent himself and of his world.</p>

  <p>Thus, wherever we touch the practical life of man, we are at once
  referred to a metaphysic. His creed is the heart of his character,
  and it beats as a pulse in every action. Hence, when we deal with
  moral life, we <i>must</i> start from the centre. In our intellectual
  life, it is not obviously unreasonable to suppose that there is no
  need of endeavouring to reach upward to a constructive idea, which
  makes the universe one, but when we act, such self-deception is not
  possible. As a moral agent, and a moral agent man always is, he not
  only may, but must have his working hypothesis, and that hypothesis
  must be all-inclusive. As there are natural laws which connect man's
  physical movements with the whole system of nature, so there are
  spiritual relations which connect him with the whole spiritual
  universe; and spiritual relations are always direct.</p>

  <p>Now it follows from this, that, whenever we consider <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg055" id="pg055">055</a></span> man as a moral
  agent, that is, as an agent who converts ideas into actual things,
  the need of a philosophy becomes evident. Instead of condemning ideal
  interpretations of the universe as useless dreams, the foolish
  products of an ambition of thought which refuses to respect the
  limits of the human intellect, we shall understand that philosophers
  and poets are really striving with greater clearness of vision, and
  in a more sustained manner, to perform the task which all men are
  obliged to perform in some way or other. Man subsists as a natural
  being only on condition of comprehending, to some degree, the
  conditions of his natural life, and the laws of his natural
  environment. From earliest youth upwards, he is learning that fire
  will burn and water drown, and that he can play with the elements
  with safety only within the sphere lit up by his intelligence. Nature
  will not pardon the blunders of ignorance, nor tamely submit to every
  hasty construction. And this truth is still more obvious in relation
  to man's moral life. Here, too, and in a pre-eminent degree, conduct
  waits on intelligence. Deep will only answer unto deep; and great
  characters only come with much meditation on the things that are
  highest. And, on the other hand, the misconstruction of life's
  meaning flings man back upon himself, and makes his action nugatory.
  Byronism was driven "howling home again," says the poet. The universe
  will not be interpreted in terms of sense, nor be treated as carrion,
  as Carlyle said. There is no rest in the "Everlasting No," because it
  is a <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg056" id="pg056">056</a></span>
  wrong view of man and of the world. Or rather, the negative is not
  everlasting; and man is driven onwards by despair, through the
  "Centre of Indifference," till he finds a "Universal Yea"&mdash;a
  true view of his relation to the universe.</p>

  <p>There is given to men the largest choice to do or to let alone, at
  every step in life. But there is one necessity which they cannot
  escape, because they carry it within them. They absolutely must try
  to make the world their home, find some kind of reconciling idea
  between themselves and the forces amidst which they move, have some
  kind of working hypothesis of life. Nor is it possible to admit that
  they will find rest till they discover a true hypothesis. If they do
  not seek it by reflection&mdash;if, in their ardour to penetrate into
  the secrets of nature, they forget themselves; if they allow the
  supreme facts of their moral life to remain in the confusion of
  tradition, and seek to compromise the demands of their spirit by
  sacrificing to the idols of their childhood's faith; if they fortify
  themselves in the indifference of agnosticism,&mdash;they must reap
  the harvest of their irreflection. Ignorance is not harmless in
  matters of character any more than in the concerns of our outer life.
  There are in national and in individual history seasons of despair,
  and that despair, when it is deepest, is ever found to be the shadow
  of moral failure&mdash;the result of going out into action with a
  false view of the purpose of human life, and a wrong conception of
  man's destiny. At such times, the people have not understood
  themselves <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg057" id=
  "pg057">057</a></span> or their environment, and, in consequence,
  they come into collision with their own welfare. There is no
  experiment so dangerous to an age or people, as that of relegating to
  the common ignorance of unreasoning faith the deep concerns of moral
  conduct; and there is no attitude more pitiable than that which leads
  it to turn a deaf ear and the lip of contempt towards those
  philosophers who carry the spirit of scientific inquiry into these
  higher regions, and endeavour to establish for mankind, by the
  irrefragable processes of reason, those principles on which rest all
  the great elements of man's destiny. We cannot act without a theory
  of life; and to whom shall we look for such a theory, except to those
  who, undaunted by the difficulties of the task, ask once more, and
  strive to answer, those problems which man cannot entirely escape, as
  long as he continues to think and act?</p><span class=

  <h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

  <h3>BROWNING'S PLACE IN ENGLISH POETRY.</h3>

  <blockquote>
    "But there's a great contrast between him and me. He seems very
    content with life, and takes much satisfaction in the world. It's a
    very strange and curious spectacle to behold a man in these days so
    confidently cheerful." (<i>Carlyle</i>.)
  </blockquote>

  <p>It has been said of Carlyle, who may for many reasons be
  considered as our poet's twin figure, that he laid the foundations of
  his world of thought in <i>Sartor Resartus</i>, and never enlarged
  them. His <i>Orientirung</i> was over before he was forty years
  old&mdash;as is, indeed, the case with most men. After that period
  there was no fundamental change in his view of the world; nothing
  which can be called a new idea disturbed his outline sketch of the
  universe. He lived afterwards only to fill it in, showing with ever
  greater detail the relations of man to man in history, and
  emphasizing with greater grimness the war of good and evil in human
  action. There is evidence, it is true, that the formulae from which
  he more or less consciously set forth, ultimately proved too narrow
  for him, and we find him beating himself in vain against their
  limitations; still, on the whole, Carlyle speculated within the range
  and influence of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg059" id=
  "pg059">059</a></span> principles adopted early in life, and never
  abandoned for higher or richer ideas, or substantially changed.</p>

  <p>In these respects, there is considerable resemblance between
  Carlyle and Browning. Browning, indeed, fixed his point of view and
  chose his battleground still earlier; and he held it resolutely to
  his life's close. In his <i>Pauline</i> and in his Epilogue to
  <i>Asolando</i> we catch the triumphant tone of a single idea, which,
  during all the long interval, had never sunk into silence. Like</p>

  <p>Moreover, these two poets, if I may be permitted to call Carlyle a
  poet, taught the same truth. They were both witnesses to the presence
  of God in the spirit of man, and looked at this life in the light of
  another and a higher; or rather, they penetrated through the husk of
  time and saw that eternity is even here, a tranquil element
  underlying the noisy antagonisms of man's earthly life. Both of them,
  like Plato's philosopher, made their home in the sunlight of ideal
  truth: they were not denizens of the cave taking the things of sense
  for those of thought, shadows for realities, echoes for the voices of
  men.</p>

  <p>But, while Carlyle fought his way into this region, Browning found
  himself in it from the first; while Carlyle bought his freedom with a
  great sum, the poet "was free born." Carlyle saw the old world
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg060" id="pg060">060</a></span> faith
  break up around him, and its fragments never ceased to embarrass his
  path. He was <i>at</i> the point of transition, present at the
  collision of the old and new, and in the midst of the confusion. He,
  more than any other English writer, was the instrument of the change
  from the Deism of the eighteenth century and the despair which
  followed it, into the larger faith of our own. But, for Browning,
  there was a new heaven and a new earth, and old things had passed
  away. This notable contrast between the two men, arising at once from
  their disposition and their moral environment, had far-reaching
  effects on their lives and their writings. But their affinity was
  deeper than the difference, for they are essentially heirs and
  exponents of the same movement in English thought.</p>

  <p>The main characteristic of that movement is that it is both moral
  and religious, a devotion to God and the active service of man, a
  recognition at once of the rights of nature and of spirit. It does
  not, on the one hand, raise the individual as a natural being to the
  throne of the universe, and make all forces social, political, and
  spiritual stoop to his rights; nor does it, on the other hand, deny
  these rights, or make the individual a mere instrument of society. It
  at least attempts to reconcile the fundamental facts of human nature,
  without compromising any of them. It cannot be called either
  individualistic or socialistic; but it strives to be both at once, so
  that both man and society mean more to this age than they ever did
  before. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg061" id=
  "pg061">061</a></span> narrow formulae that cramped the thought of
  the period which preceded ours have been broken through. No one can
  pass from the hedonists and individualists to Carlyle and Browning
  without feeling that these two men are representatives of new forces
  in politics, in religion, and in literature,&mdash;forces which will
  undoubtedly effect momentous changes before they are caught again and
  fixed in creeds.</p>

  <p>That a new epoch in English thought was veritably opened by them
  is indicated by the surprise and bewilderment they occasioned at
  their first appearance. Carlyle had Emerson to break his loneliness
  and Browning had Rossetti; but, to most other men at that day,
  <i>Sartor</i> and <i>Pauline</i> were all but unintelligible. The
  general English reader could make little of the strange figures that
  had broken into the realm of literature; and the value and
  significance of their work, as well as its originality, will be
  recognized better by ourselves if we take a hurried glance at the
  times which lay behind them. Its main worth will be found to lie in
  the fact that they strove to bring together again certain fundamental
  elements, on which the moral life of man must always rest, and which
  had fallen asunder in the ages which preceded their own.</p>

  <p>The whole-hearted, instinctive life of the Elizabethan age was
  narrowed and deepened into the severe one-sidedness of Puritanism,
  which cast on the bright earth the sombre shadow of a life to come.
  England was given up for a time to a magnificent half-truth. It did

  </div>

  <p>After Puritanism came Charles the Second and the rights of the
  flesh, which rights were gradually clarified, till they contradicted
  themselves in the benevolent self-seeking of altruistic hedonism.
  David Hume led the world out of the shadow of eternity, and showed
  that it was only an object of the five senses; or of six, if we add
  that of "hunger." The divine element was explained away, and the
  proper study of mankind was, not man, as that age thought, but man
  reduced to his beggarly elements&mdash;a being animated solely by the
  sensuous springs of pleasure and pain, which should properly, as
  Carlyle thought, go on all fours, and not lay claim to the dignity of
  being moral. All things were reduced to what they seemed, robbed of
  their suggestiveness, changed into definite, sharp-edged, mutually
  exclusive particulars. The world was an aggregate of isolated facts,
  or, at the best, a mechanism into which particulars were fitted by
  force; and society was a gathering of mere individuals, repelling
  each other by their needs and greed, with a ring of natural necessity
  to bind them together. It was a fit time for political economy to
  supplant ethics. There was nowhere an ideal which could lift man
  above his natural self, and teach him, by losing it, to find a higher
  life. And, as a necessary <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg063" id=
  "pg063">063</a></span> consequence, religion gave way to naturalism
  and poetry to prose.</p>

  <p>After this age of prose came our own day. The new light first
  flushed the modern world in the writings of the philosopher-poets of
  Germany: Kant and Lessing, Fichte and Schiller, Goethe and Hegel.
  They brought about the Copernican change. For them this world of the
  five senses, of space and time and natural cause, instead of being
  the fixed centre around which all things revolved, was explicable
  only in its relation to a system which was spiritual; and man found
  his meaning in his connection with society, the life of which
  stretched endlessly far back into the past and forward into the
  future. Psychology gave way to metaphysics. The universal element in
  the thought of man was revealed. Instead of mechanism there was life.
  A new spirit of poetry and philosophy brought God back into the
  world, revealed his incarnation in the mind of man, and changed
  nature into a pellucid garment within which throbbed the love divine.
  The antagonism of hard alternatives was at an end; the universe was
  spirit-woven and every smallest object was "filled full of magical
  music, as they freight a star with light." There were no longer two
  worlds, but one; for "the other" world penetrated this, and was
  revealed in it: thought and sense, spirit and nature, were
  reconciled. These thinkers made room for man, as against the
  Puritans, and for God, as against their successors. Instead of the
  hopeless struggle of ascetic morality, which divides man against
  himself, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg064" id=
  "pg064">064</a></span> they awakened him to that sense of his
  reconciliation with his ideal which religion gives: "Psyche drinks
  its stream and forgets her sorrows."</p>

  <p>Now, this is just the soil where art blooms. For what is beauty
  but the harmony of thought and sense, a universal meaning caught and
  tamed in the particular? To the poet each little flower that blooms
  has endless worth, and is regarded as perfect and complete; for he
  sees that the spirit of the whole dwells in it. It whispers to him
  the mystery of the infinite; it is a pulse in which beats the
  universal heart. The true poet finds God everywhere; for the ideal is
  actual wherever beauty dwells. And there is the closest affinity
  between art and religion, as its history proves, from Job and Isaiah,
  Homer and Aeschylus, to our own poet; for both art and religion lift
  us, each in its own way, above one-sidedness and limitation, to the
  region of the universal. The one draws God to man, brings perfection
  <i>here</i>, and reaches its highest form in the joyous life of
  Greece, where the natural world was clothed with almost supernatural
  beauty; the other lifts man to God, and finds this life good because
  it reflects and suggests the greater life that is to be. Both poetry
  and religion are a reconciliation and a satisfaction; both lift man
  above the contradictions of limited existence, and place him in the
  region of peace&mdash;where,</p>

  <p>Such notes as these could not be struck by Pope, nor be understood
  by the age of prose. Still they are only the prelude of the fuller
  song of Browning. Whether he be a greater poet than these or
  not,&mdash;a question whose answer can benefit nothing, for each poet
  has his own worth, and reflects by his own facet the universal
  truth&mdash;his poetry contains in it larger elements, and the
  promise of a deeper harmony from the harsher discords of his more
  stubborn material. Even where their spheres touch, Browning held by
  the artistic truth in a different manner. To Shelley, perhaps the
  most intensely spiritual of all our poets,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"That light whose smile kindles the universe,</p>

    <p>That beauty in which all things work and move,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>was an impassioned sentiment, a glorious intoxication; to Browning
  it was a conviction, reasoned and willed, possessing the whole man,
  and held in the sober moments when the heart is silent. "The heavy
  and the weary weight of all this unintelligible world" was lightened
  for Wordsworth, only when he was far from the haunts of men, and free
  from the "dreary intercourse of daily life"; but Browning weaved his
  song of hope right amidst the wail and woe of man's sin and
  wretchedness. For Wordsworth "sensations sweet, felt in the blood and
  felt along the heart, passed into his purer mind with tranquil
  restoration," and issued "in a serene and blessed mood"; but
  Browning's poetry is not merely the poetry of the emotions however
  sublimated. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg067" id=
  "pg067">067</a></span> He starts with the hard repellent fact,
  crushes by sheer force of thought its stubborn rind, presses into it,
  and brings forth the truth at its heart. The greatness of Browning's
  poetry is in its perceptive grip: and in nothing is he more original
  than in the manner in which he takes up his task, and assumes his
  artistic function. In his postponement of feeling to thought we
  recognize a new poetic method, the significance of which we cannot
  estimate as yet. But, although we may fail to apprehend the meaning
  of the new method he employs, we cannot fail to perceive the fact,
  which is not less striking, that the region from which he quarries
  his material is new.</p>

  <p>And yet he does not break away abruptly from his predecessors. His
  kinship with them, in that he recognizes the presence of God in
  nature, is everywhere evident. We quote one passage, scarcely to be
  surpassed by any of our poets, as indicative of his power of dealing
  with the supernaturalism of nature.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"The centre-fire heaves underneath the earth,</p>

    <p>And the earth changes like a human face;</p>

    <p>In hidden mines, spots barren river-beds,</p>

    <p>Like a smile striving with a wrinkled face.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Above, birds fly in merry flocks, the lark</p>

    <p>Soars up and up, shivering for very joy;</p>

    <p>Of nested limpets; savage creatures seek</p>

    <p>Their loves in wood and plain&mdash;and God renews</p>

    <p>His ancient rapture. Thus He dwells in all,</p>

    <p>From life's minute beginnings, up at last</p>

    <p>To man&mdash;the consummation of this scheme</p>

    <p>Of being, the completion of this sphere of life."<sup>A</sup></p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Paracelsus.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>Such passages as these contain neither the rapt, reflective calm
  of Wordsworth's solemn tones, nor the ethereal intoxication of
  Shelley's spirit-music; but there is in them the same consciousness
  of the infinite meaning of natural facts. And beyond this, there is
  also, in the closing lines, a hint of a new region for art. Shelley
  and Wordsworth were the poets of Nature, as all truly say; Browning
  was the poet of the human soul. For Shelley, the beauty in which all
  things work and move was well-nigh "quenched by the eclipsing curse
  of the birth of man"; and Wordsworth lived beneath the habitual sway
  of fountains, meadows, hills and groves, while he kept grave watch
  o'er man's mortality, and saw the shades of the prison-house gather
  round him. From the life of man they garnered nought but mad
  indignation, or mellowed sadness. It was a foolish and furious strife
  with <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg069" id="pg069">069</a></span>
  unknown powers fought in the dark, from which the poet kept aloof,
  for he could not see that God dwelt amidst the chaos. But Browning
  found "harmony in immortal souls, spite of the muddy vesture of
  decay." He found nature crowned in man, though man was mean and
  miserable. At the heart of the most wretched abortion of wickedness
  there was the mark of the loving touch of God. Shelley turned away
  from man; Wordsworth paid him rare visits, like those of a being from
  a strange world, made wise and sad with looking at him from afar;
  Browning dwelt with him. He was a comrade in the fight, and ever in
  the van of man's endeavour bidding him be of good cheer. He was a
  witness for God in the midmost dark, where meet in deathless struggle
  the elemental powers of right and wrong. For God is present for him,
  not only in the order and beauty of nature, but in the world of will
  and thought. Beneath the caprice and wilful lawlessness of individual
  action, he saw a beneficent purpose which cannot fail, but "has its
  way with man, not he with it."</p>

  <p>Now this was a new world for poetry to enter into; a new depth to
  penetrate with hope; and Browning was the first of modern poets
  to</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i12">"Stoop</p>

    <p>Into the vast and unexplored abyss,</p>

    <p class="i8">Strenuously beating</p>

    <p>The silent boundless regions of the sky."</p>
  </div>

  <p>It is also a new world for religion and morality; <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg070" id="pg070">070</a></span> and to understand
  it demands a deeper insight into the fundamental elements of human
  life.</p>

  <p>To show this in a proximately adequate manner, we should be
  obliged, as already hinted, to connect the poet's work, not merely
  with that of his English predecessors, but with the deeper and more
  comprehensive movement of the thought of Germany since the time of
  Kant. It would be necessary to indicate how, by breaking a way
  through the narrow creeds and equally narrow scepticism of the
  previous age, the new spirit extended the horizon of man's active and
  contemplative life, and made him free of the universe, and the
  repository of the past conquests of his race. It proposed to man the
  great task of solving the problem of humanity, but it strengthened
  him with its past achievement, and inspired him with the conviction
  of its boundless progress. It is not that the significance of the
  individual or the meaning of his endeavour is lost. Under this new
  view, man has still to fight for his own hand, and it is still
  recognized that spirit is always burdened with its own fate and
  cannot share its responsibility. Morality does not give way to
  religion or pass into it, and there is a sense in which the
  individual is always alone in the sphere of duty.</p>

  <p>But from this new point of view the individual is re-explained for
  us, and we begin to understand that he is the focus of a light which
  is universal, "one more incarnation of the mind of God." His moral
  task is no longer to seek his own in the old sense, but to elevate
  humanity; for it is only by <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg071" id=
  "pg071">071</a></span> taking this circuit that he can come to his
  own. Such a task as this is a sufficiently great one to occupy all
  time; but it is to humanity in him that the task belongs, and it will
  therefore be achieved. This is no new one-sidedness. It does not
  mean, to those who comprehend it, the supplanting of the individual
  thought by the collective thought, or the substitution of humanity
  for man. The universal is <i>in</i> the particular, the fact
  <i>is</i> the law. There is no collision between the whole and the
  part, for the whole lives in the part. As each individual plant has
  its own life and beauty and worth, although the universe has
  conspired to bring it into being; so also, and in a far higher
  degree, man has his own duty and his own dignity, although he is but
  the embodiment of forces, natural and spiritual, which have come from
  the endless past. Like a letter in a word, or a word in a sentence,
  he gets his meaning from his context; <i>but the sentence is
  meaningless without him</i>. "Rays from all round converge in him,"
  and he has no power except that which has been lent to him; but all
  the same, nay, all the more, he must</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Think as if man never thought before!</p>

    <p>Act as if all creation hung attent</p>

    <p>On the acting of such faculty as his."<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>His responsibility, his individuality, is not less, but greater,
  in that he can, in his thought and moral action, command the forces
  that the race has stored for him. The great man speaks the thought of
  his <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg072" id="pg072">072</a></span>
  people, and his invocations as their priest are just the expression
  of their dumb yearnings. And even the mean and insignificant man is
  what he is, in virtue of the humanity which is blurred and distorted
  within him; and he can shed his insignificance and meanness, only by
  becoming a truer vehicle for that humanity.</p>

  <p>Thus, when spirit is spiritually discerned, it is seen that man is
  bound to man in a union closer than any physical organism can show;
  while "the individual," in the old sense of a being <i>opposed</i> to
  society and <i>opposed</i> to the world, is found to be a fiction of
  abstract thought, not discoverable anywhere, because not real. And,
  on the other hand, society is no longer "collective," but so organic
  that the whole is potentially in every part&mdash;an organism
  <i>of</i> organisms.</p>

  <p>The influence of this organic idea in every department of thought
  which concerns itself with man is not to be measured. It is already
  fast changing all the practical sciences of man&mdash;economics,
  politics, ethics and religion. The material, being newly interpreted,
  is wrought into a new purpose, and revelation is once more bringing
  about a reformation. But human action in its ethical aspect is, above
  all, charged with a new significance. The idea of duty has received
  an expansion almost illimitable, and man himself has thereby attained
  new worth and dignity&mdash;for what is duty except a dignity and
  opportunity, man's chance of being good? When we contrast this view
  of the life of man as the life of humanity in him, with the old
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg073" id="pg073">073</a></span>
  individualism, we may say that morality also has at last, in Bacon's
  phrase, passed from the narrow seas into the open ocean. And after
  all, the greatest achievement of our age may be not that it has
  established the sciences of nature, but that it has made possible the
  science of man. We have, at length, reached a point of view from
  which we may hope to understand ourselves. Law, order, continuity, in
  human action&mdash;the essential pre-conditions of a moral
  science&mdash;were beyond the reach of an individualistic theory. It
  left to ethical writers no choice but that of either sacrificing man
  to law, or law to man; of denying either the particular or the
  universal element in his nature. Naturalism did the first.
  Intuitionism, the second. The former made human action the
  <i>re</i>action of a natural agent on the incitement of natural
  forces. It made man a mere object, a <i>thing</i> capable of being
  affected by other things through his faculty of being pained or
  pleased; an object acting in obedience to motives that had an
  external origin, just like any other object. The latter theory cut
  man free from the world and his fellows, endowed him with a will that
  had no law, and a conscience that was dogmatic; and thereby succeeded
  in stultifying both law and morality.</p>

  <p>But this new consciousness of the relation of man to mankind and
  the world takes him out of his isolation and still leaves him free.
  It relates men to one another in a humanity, which is incarnated anew
  in each of them. It elevates the individual above the <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg074" id="pg074">074</a></span> distinctions of
  time; it treasures up the past in him as the active energy of his
  knowledge and morality in the present, and also as the potency of the
  ideal life of the future. On this view, the individual and the race
  are possible only through each other.</p>

  <p>This fundamental change in our way of looking at the life of man
  is bound to abolish the ancient landmarks and bring confusion for a
  time. Out of the new conception, <i>i.e.,</i> out of the idea of
  evolution, has sprung the tumult as well as the strength of our time.
  The present age is moved with thoughts beyond the reach of its
  powers: great aspirations for the well-being of the people and high
  ideals of social welfare flash across its mind, to be followed again
  by thicker darkness. There is hardly any limit to its despair or
  hope. It has a far larger faith in the destiny of man than any of its
  predecessors, and yet it is <i>sure</i> of hardly
  anything&mdash;except that the ancient rules of human life are false.
  Individualism is now detected as scepticism and moral chaos in
  disguise. We know that the old methods are no longer of use. We
  cannot now cut ourselves free of the fate of others. The confused
  cries for help that are heard on every hand are recognized as the
  voices of our brethren; and we now know that our fate is involved in
  theirs, and that the problem of their welfare is also ours. We
  grapple with social questions at last, and recognize that the issues
  of life and death lie in the solution of these enigmas. Legislators
  and economists, teachers of religion and socialists, are all alike
  social reformers. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg075" id=
  "pg075">075</a></span> Philanthropy has taken a deeper meaning; and
  all sects bear its banner. But their forces are beaten back by the
  social wretchedness, for they have not found the sovereign remedy of
  a great idea; and the result is in many ways sad enough. Our social
  remedies often work mischief; for we degrade those whom we would
  elevate, and in our charity forget justice. We insist on the rights
  of the people and the duties of the privileged classes, and thereby
  tend to teach greed to those for whom we labour, and goodness to
  those whom we condemn. The task that lies before us is plain: we want
  the welfare of the people as a whole. But we fail to grasp the
  complex social elements together, and our very remedies tend to
  sunder them. We know that the public good will not be obtained by
  separating man from man, securing each unit in a charmed circle of
  personal rights, and protecting it from others by isolation. We must
  find a place for the individual within the social organism, and we
  know now that this organism has not, as our fathers seemed to think,
  the simple constitution of a wooden doll. Society is not put together
  mechanically, and the individual cannot be outwardly attached to it,
  if he is to be helped, He must rather share its life, be the heir of
  the wealth it has garnered for him in the past, and participate in
  its onward movement. Between this new social ideal and our
  attainment, between the magnitude of our social duties and the
  resources of intellect and will at our command, there lies a chasm
  which we despair of bridging over.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg076" id="pg076">076</a></span>

  <p>The characteristics of this epoch faithfully reflect themselves in
  the pages of Carlyle, with whose thoughts those of Browning are
  immediately connected. It was Carlyle who first effectively revealed
  to England the continuity of human life, and the magnitude of the
  issues of individual action. Seeing the infinite in the finite,
  living under a continued sense of the mystery that surrounds man, he
  flung explosive negations amidst the narrow formulae of the social
  and religious orthodoxy of his day, blew down the blinding walls of
  ethical individualism, and, amidst much smoke and din, showed his
  English readers something of the greatness of the moral world. He
  gave us a philosophy of clothes, penetrated through symbols to the
  immortal ideas, condemned all shibboleths, and revealed the soul of
  humanity behind the external modes of man's activity. He showed us,
  in a word, that the world is spiritual, that loyalty to duty is the
  foundation of all human good, and that national welfare rests on
  character. After reading him, it is impossible for any one who
  reflects on the nature of duty to ask, "Am I my brother's keeper?" He
  not only imagined, but knew, how "all things the minutest that man
  does, minutely influence all men, and the very look of his face
  blesses or curses whom-so it lights on, and so generates ever new
  blessing or new cursing. I say, there is not a Red Indian, hunting by
  Lake Winnipeg, can quarrel with his squaw, but the whole world must
  smart for it: will not the price of beaver rise? It is a mathematical
  fact <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg077" id="pg077">077</a></span>
  that the casting of this pebble from my hand alters the centre of
  gravity of the universe." Carlyle dealt the deathblow to the
  "laissez-faire" theory rampant in his day, and made each individual
  responsible for the race. He has demonstrated that the sphere of duty
  does not terminate with ourselves and our next-door neighbours. There
  will be no pure air for the correctest Levite to breathe, till the
  laws of sanitation have been applied to the moral slums. "Ye are my
  brethren," said he, and he adds, as if conscious of his too
  denunciatory way of dealing with them, "hence my rage and
  sorrow."</p>

  <p>But his consciousness of brotherhood with all men brought only
  despair for him. He saw clearly the responsibility of man, but not
  the dignity which that implies; he felt the weight of the burden of
  humanity upon his own soul, and it crushed him, for he forgot that
  all the good of the world was there to help him bear it, and that
  "One with God is a majority." He taught only the half-truth, that all
  men are united on the side of duty, and that the spiritual life of
  each is conditional on striving to save all. But he neglected the
  complement of this truth, and forgot the greatness of the beings on
  whom so great a duty could be laid. He therefore dignifies humanity
  only to degrade it again. The "twenty millions" each must try to save
  "are mostly fools." But how fools, when they can have such a task? Is
  it not true, on the contrary, that no man ever saw a duty beyond his
  strength, and that "man can because he <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg078" id="pg078">078</a></span> ought" and ought only because he
  can? The evils an individual cannot overcome are the moral
  opportunities of his fellows. The good are not lone workers of God's
  purposes, and there is no need of despair. Carlyle, like the ancient
  prophet, was too conscious of his own mission, and too forgetful of
  that of others. "I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts;
  because the children of Israel have forgotten Thy covenant, thrown
  down Thine alters, and slain Thy prophets, and I, even I only, am
  left; and they seek my life, to take it away." He needed, beside the
  consciousness of his prophetic function, a consciousness of
  brotherhood with humbler workers. "Yet I have left Me seven thousand
  in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every
  mouth which hath not kissed him." It would have helped him had he
  remembered, that there were on all sides other workers engaged on the
  temple not made with hands, although he could not hear the sound of
  their hammers for the din he made himself. It would have changed his
  despair into joy, and his pity into a higher moral quality, had he
  been able to believe that, amidst all the millions against whom he
  hurled his anathemas, there is no one who, let him do what he will,
  is not constrained to illustrate either the folly and wretchedness of
  sin, or the glory of goodness. It is not given to any one, least of
  all to the wicked, to hold back the onward movement of the race, or
  to destroy the impulse for good which is planted within
  it.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg079" id=
  "pg079">079</a></span>

  <p>But Carlyle saw only one side of the truth about man's moral
  nature and destiny. He knew, as the ancient prophets did, that evil
  is potential wreck; and he taxed the power of metaphor to the utmost
  to indicate, how wrong gradually takes root, and ripens into
  putrescence and self-combustion, in obedience to a necessity which is
  absolute. That morality is the essence of things, that wrong
  <i>must</i> prove its weakness, that right is the only might, is
  reiterated and illustrated on all his pages; they are now
  commonplaces of speculation on matters of history, if not conscious
  practical principles which guide its makers. But Carlyle never
  inquired into the character of this moral necessity, and he
  overlooked the beneficence which places death at the heart of sin. He
  never saw wrong except on its way to execution, or in the death
  throes; but he did not look in the face of the gentle power that led
  it on to death. He saw the necessity which rules history, but not the
  beneficent character of that necessity.</p>

  <p>The same limitations marred his view of duty, which was his
  greatest revelation to his age. He felt its categorical authority and
  its binding force. But the power which imposed the duty was an alien
  power, awful in majesty, infinite in might, a "great task-master";
  and the duty itself was an outer law, written in letters of flame
  across the high heavens, in comparison with which man's action at its
  best sank into failure. His only virtue is obedience, and his last
  rendering even of himself is <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg080"
  id="pg080">080</a></span> "unprofitable servant." In this he has much
  of the combined strength and weakness of the old Scottish Calvinism.
  "He stands between the individual and the Infinite without hope or
  guide. He has a constant disposition to crush the human being by
  comparing him with God," said Mazzini, with marvellous penetration.
  "From his lips, at times so daring, we seem to hear every instant the
  cry of the Breton Mariner&mdash;'My God protect me! My bark is so
  small, and Thy ocean so vast.'" His reconciliation of God and man was
  incomplete: God seemed to him to have manifested Himself <i>to</i>
  man but not <i>in</i> man. He did not see that "the Eternity which is
  before and behind us is also within us."</p>

  <p>But the moral law which commands is just the reflection of the
  aspirations of progressive man, who always creates his own horizon.
  The extension of duty is the objective counterpart of man's growth; a
  proof of victory and not of failure, a sign that man is mounting
  upwards. And, if so, it is irrational to infer the impossibility of
  success from the magnitude of the demands of a moral law, which is
  itself the promise of a better future. The hard problems set for us
  by our social environment are recognized as set by ourselves; for, in
  matters of morality, the eye sees only what the heart prompts. The
  very statement of the difficulty contains the potency of its
  solution; for evil, when understood, is on the way towards being
  overcome, and the good, when seen, contains the promise of its own
  fulfilment. It is ignorance which is ruinous, as when the cries of
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg081" id="pg081">081</a></span>
  humanity beat against a deaf ear; and we can take a comfort, denied
  to Carlyle, from the fact that he has made us awake to our social
  duties. He has let loose the confusion upon us, and it is only
  natural that we should at first be overcome by a sense of bewildered
  helplessness. But this very sense contains the germ of hope, and
  England is struggling to its feet to wrestle with its wrongs. Carlyle
  has brought us within sight of our future, and we are now taking a
  step into it. He has been our guide in the wilderness; but he died
  there, and was denied the view from Pisgah.</p>

  <p>Now, this view was given to Robert Browning, and he broke out into
  a song of victory, whose strains will give strength and comfort to
  many in the coming time. That his solution of the evils of life is
  not final, may at once be admitted. There are elements in the problem
  of which he has taken no account, and which will force those who seek
  light on the deeper mysteries of man's moral nature, to go beyond
  anything that the poet has to say. Even the poet himself grows, at
  least in some directions, less confident of the completeness of his
  triumph as he grows older. His faith in the good does not fail, but
  it is the faith of one who confesses to ignorance, and links himself
  to his finitude. Still, so thorough is his conviction of the moral
  purpose of life, of the certainty of the good towards which man is
  moving, and of the beneficence of the power which is at work
  everywhere in the world, that many of his poems ring like the
  triumphant songs of Luther.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg082"

  <h3>BROWNING'S OPTIMISM.</h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Gladness be with thee, Helper of the World!</p>

    <p>I think this is the authentic sign and seal</p>

    <p>Of Godship, that it ever waxes glad,</p>

    <p>And more glad, until gladness blossoms, bursts</p>

    <p>Into a rage to suffer for mankind,</p>

    <p>And recommence at sorrow."<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Balaustion's Adventure</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>I have tried to show that one of the distinctive features of the
  present era is the stress it lays on the worth of the moral life of
  man, and the new significance it has given to that life by its view
  of the continuity of history. This view finds expression, on its
  social and ethical side, in the pages of Carlyle and Browning: both
  of whom are interested exclusively, one may almost say, in the
  evolution of human character; and both of whom, too, regard that
  evolution as the realization by man of the purposes, greater than
  man's, which rule in the world. And, although neither of them
  developed the organic view of humanity, which is implied in their
  doctrines, into an explicit philosophy, still the moral life of the
  individual is for each of them the infinite life in the finite. The
  meaning of the universe is <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg083" id=
  "pg083">083</a></span> moral, its last might is rightness; and the
  task of man is to catch up that meaning, convert it into his own
  motive, and thereby make it the source of his actions, the inmost
  principle of his life. This, fully grasped, will bring the finite and
  the infinite, morality and religion, together, and reconcile
  them.</p>

  <p>But the reconciliation which Carlyle sought to effect was
  incomplete on every side&mdash;even within the sphere of duty, with
  which alone, as moralist, he specially concerned himself. The moral
  law was imposed upon man by a higher power, in the presence of whom
  man was awed and crushed; for that power had stinted man's endowment,
  and set him to fight a hopeless battle against endless evil. God was
  everywhere around man, and the universe was just the expression of
  His will&mdash;a will inexorably bent on the good, so that evil could
  not prevail; but God was not <i>within</i> man, except as a voice of
  conscience issuing imperatives and threats. An infinite duty was laid
  upon a finite being, and its weight made him break out into a cry of
  despair.</p>

  <p>Browning, however, not only sought to bring about the
  reconciliation, but succeeded, in so far as that is possible <i>in
  terms of mere feeling</i>. His poetry contains suggestions that the
  moral will without is also a force within man; that the power which
  makes for righteousness in the world has penetrated into, or rather
  manifests itself <i>as</i>, man. Intelligence and will, the reason
  which apprehends the nature of things, and the original impulse of
  self-conscious life which issues in action, are God's power in man;
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg084" id="pg084">084</a></span> so
  that God is realizing Himself in the deeds of man, and human history
  is just His return to Himself. Outer law and inner motive are, for
  the poet, manifestations of the same beneficent purpose; and instead
  of duty in the sense of an autocratic imperative, or beneficent
  tyranny, he finds, deep beneath man's foolishness and sin, a constant
  tendency towards the good which is bound up with the very nature of
  man's reason and will. If man could only understand himself he would
  find without him no limiting necessity, but the manifestation of a
  law which is one with his own essential being. A beneficent power has
  loaded the dice, according to the epigram, so that the chances of
  failure and victory are not even; for man's nature is itself a divine
  endowment, one with the power that rules his life, and man must
  finally reach through error to truth, and through sin to holiness. In
  the language of theology, it may be said that the moral process is
  the spiritual incarnation of God; it is God's goodness as love,
  effecting itself in human action. Hence Carlyle's cry of despair is
  turned by Browning into a song of victory. While the former regards
  the struggle between good and evil as a fixed battle, in which the
  forces are immovably interlocked, the latter has the consciousness of
  battling against a retreating foe; and the conviction of coming
  triumph gives joyous vigour to every stroke. Browning lifted morality
  into an optimism, and translated its battle into song. This was the
  distinctive mark and mission which give to him such power of moral
  inspiration.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg085" id=
  "pg085">085</a></span>

  <p>In order, however, to estimate the value of this feature of the
  poet's work, it is necessary to look more closely into the character
  of his faith in the good. Merely to attribute to him an optimistic
  creed is to say very little; for the worth, or worthlessness, of such
  a creed depends upon its content&mdash;upon its fidelity to the facts
  of human life, the clearness of its consciousness of the evils it
  confronts, and the intensity of its realism.</p>

  <p>There is a sense, and that a true one, in which it may be said
  that all men are optimists; for such a faith is implied in every
  conscious and deliberate action of man. There is no deed which is not
  an attempt to realize an ideal; whenever man acts he seeks a good,
  however ruinously he may misunderstand its nature. Final and absolute
  disbelief in an ultimate good in the sphere of morals, like absolute
  scepticism in the sphere of knowledge, is a disguised
  self-contradiction, and therefore an impossibility in fact. The one
  stultifies action, and asserts an effect without any cause, or even
  contrary to the cause; the other stultifies intellectual activity:
  and both views imply that the critic has so escaped the conditions of
  human life, as to be able to pass a condemnatory judgment upon them.
  The belief that a harmonious relation between the self-conscious
  agent and the supreme good is possible, underlies the practical
  activity of man; just as the belief in the unity of thought and being
  underlies his intellectual activity. A moral order&mdash;that is, an
  order of rational ends&mdash;is postulated in all human <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg086" id="pg086">086</a></span> actions, and we
  act at all only in virtue of it,&mdash;just as truly as we move and
  work only in virtue of the forces which make the spheres revolve, or
  think by help of the meaning which presses upon us from the
  thought-woven world, through all the pores of sense. A true ethics,
  like a true psychology, or a true science of nature, must lean upon
  metaphysics, and it cannot pretend to start <i>ab initio</i>. We live
  in the Copernican age, which puts the individual in a system, in
  obedience to whose laws he finds his welfare. And this is simply the
  assertion of an optimistic creed, for it implies a harmonious
  world.</p>

  <p>But, though this is true, it must be remembered that this faith is
  a prophetic anticipation, rather than acquired knowledge. We are only
  on the way towards reconstructing in thought the fact which we are,
  or towards bringing into clear knowledge the elemental power which
  manifests itself within us as thought, desire, and deed. And, until
  this is achieved, we have no full right to an optimistic creed. The
  revelation of the unity which pervades all things, even in the
  natural world, will be the last attainment of science; and the
  reconciliation of nature and man and God is still further in the
  future, and will be the last triumph of philosophy. During all the
  interval the world will be a scene of warring elements; and poetry,
  religion, and philosophy can only hold forth a promise, and give to
  man a foretaste of ultimate victory. And in this state of things even
  <i>their</i> assurance often <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg087"
  id="pg087">087</a></span> falters. Faith lapses into doubt, poetry
  becomes a wail for a lost god, and its votary exhibits, "through
  Europe to the AEtolian shore, the pageant of his bleeding heart." The
  optimistic faith is, as a rule, only a hope and a desire, a "Grand
  Perhaps," which knows no defence against the critical understanding,
  and sinks dumb when questioned. If, in the form of a religious
  conviction, its assurance is more confident, then, too often, it
  rests upon the treacherous foundations of authoritative ignorance,
  which crumble into dust beneath the blows of awakened and liberated
  reason. Nay, if by the aid of philosophy we turn our optimism into a
  faith held by reason, a fact before which the intellect, as well as
  the heart, worships and grows glad, it still is for most of us only a
  general hypothesis, a mere leap to God which spurns the intermediate
  steps, a universal without content, a bare form that lacks
  reality.</p>

  <p>Such an optimism, such a plunge into the pure blue and away from
  facts, was Emerson's. Caroline Fox tells a story of him and Carlyle
  which reveals this very pointedly. It seems that Carlyle once led the
  serene philosopher through the abominations of the streets of London
  at midnight, asking him with grim humour at every few steps, "Do you
  believe in the devil <i>now</i>?" Emerson replied that the more he
  saw of the English people the greater and better he thought them.
  This little incident lays bare the limits of both these great men.
  Where the one saw, the other was blind. To the <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg088" id="pg088">088</a></span> one there was the
  misery and the universal mirk; to the other, the pure white beam was
  scarcely broken. Carlyle believed in the good, beyond all doubt: he
  fought his great battle in its strength and won, but "he was sorely
  wounded." Emerson was Sir Galahad, blind to all but the Holy Grail,
  his armour spotless-white, his virtue cloistered and unbreathed, his
  race won without the dust and heat. But his optimism was too easy to
  be satisfactory. His victory was not won in the enemy's citadel,
  where sin sits throned amidst the chaos, but in the placid upper air
  of poetic imagination. And, in consequence, Emerson can only convince
  the converted; and his song is not heard in the dark, nor does it
  cheer the wayfarer on the muddy highway, along which burthened
  humanity meanly toils.</p>

  <p>But Browning's optimism is more earnest and real than any pious
  hope, or dogmatic belief, or benevolent theory held by a placid
  philosopher, protected against contact with the sins and sorrows of
  man as by an invisible garment of contemplative holiness. It is a
  conviction which has sustained shocks of criticism and the test of
  facts; and it therefore, both for the poet and his readers, fulfils a
  mission beyond the reach of any easy trust in a mystic good. Its
  power will be felt and its value recognized by those who have
  themselves confronted the contradictions of human life and known
  their depths.</p>

  <p>No lover of Browning's poetry can miss the vigorous manliness of
  the poet's own bearing, or fail <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg089"
  id="pg089">089</a></span> to recognize the strength that flows from
  his joyous, fearless personality, and the might of his intellect and
  heart. "When British literature," said Carlyle of Scott and Cobbett,
  "lay all puking and sprawling in Wertherism, Byronism and other
  Sentimentalisms, nature was kind enough to send us two healthy men."
  And he breaks out into a eulogy of mere health, of "the just balance
  of faculties that radiates a glad light outwards, enlightening and
  embellishing all things." But he finds it easy to account for the
  health of these men: they had never faced the mystery of existence.
  Such healthiness we find in Browning, although he wrote with Carlyle
  at his side, and within earshot of the infinite wail of this moral
  fatalist. And yet, the word health is inadequate to convey the depth
  of the joyous meaning which the poet found in the world. His optimism
  was not a constitutional and irreflective hopefulness, to be
  accounted for on the ground that "the great mystery of existence was
  not great to him: did not drive him into rocky solitudes to wrestle
  with it for an answer, to be answered or to perish." There are,
  indeed, certain rash and foolish persons who pretend to trace
  Browning's optimism to his mixed descent; but there is a "pause in
  the leading and the light" of those wiseacres, who pretend to trace
  moral and mental characteristics to physiological antecedents. They
  cannot quite catch a great man in the making, nor, even by the help
  of evolution, say anything wiser about genius than that "the
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg090" id="pg090">090</a></span> wind
  bloweth where it listeth." No doubt the poet's optimism indicates a
  native sturdiness of head and heart. He had the invaluable endowment
  of a pre-disposition to see the sunny side of life, and a native
  tendency to revolt against that subjectivity, which is the root of
  our misery in all its forms. He had little respect for the
  <i>Welt-schmerz,</i> and can scarcely be civil to the hero of the
  bleeding heart.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Browning was no doubt least of all men inclined to pout at his
  "plain bun"; on the contrary, he was awake to the grandeur of his
  inheritance, and valued most highly "his life-rent of God's universe
  with the tasks it offered and the tools to do them with." But his
  optimism sent its roots deeper than any "disposition"; it penetrated
  beyond mere health of body and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg091"
  id="pg091">091</a></span> mind, as it did beyond a mere sentiment of
  God's goodness. Optimisms resting on these bases are always weak; for
  the former leaves man naked and sensitive to the evils that crowd
  round him when the powers of body and mind decay, and the latter is,
  at best, useful only for the individual who possesses it, and it
  breaks down under the stress of criticism and doubt. Browning's
  optimism is a great element in English literature, because it opposes
  with such strength the shocks that come from both these quarters. His
  joyousness is the reflection <i>in feeling</i> of a conviction as to
  the nature of things, which he had verified in the darkest details of
  human life, and established for himself in the face of the gravest
  objections that his intellect was able to call forth. In fact, its
  value lies, above all, in this,&mdash;that it comes after criticism,
  after the condemnation which Byron and Carlyle had passed, each from
  his own point of view, on the world and on man.</p>

  <p>The need of an optimism is one of the penalties which reflection
  brings. Natural life takes the goodness of things for granted; but
  reflection disturbs the placid contentment and sets man at variance
  with his world. The fruit of the tree of knowledge always reveals his
  nakedness to man; he is turned out of the paradise of unconsciousness
  and doomed to force Nature, now conceived as a step-dame, to satisfy
  needs which are now first felt. Optimism is the expression of man's
  new reconciliation with his world; as the opposite doctrine of
  pessimism is the consciousness of an unresolved contradiction.
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg092" id="pg092">092</a></span> Both
  are a judgment passed upon the world, from the point of view of its
  adequacy or inadequacy to meet demands, arising from needs which the
  individual has discovered in himself.</p>

  <p>Now, as I have tried to show, one of the main characteristics of
  the opening years of the present era was its deeper intuition of the
  significance of human life, and, therefore, by implication, of its
  wants and claims. The spiritual nature of man, lost sight of during
  the preceding age, was re-discovered; and the first and immediate
  consequence was that man, as man, attained infinite worth. "Man was
  born free," cried Rousseau, with a conviction which swept all before
  it; "he has original, inalienable, and supreme rights against all
  things which can set themselves against him." And Rousseau's
  countrymen believed him. There was not a <i>Sans-culotte</i> amongst
  them all but held his head high, being creation's lord; and history
  can scarcely show a parallel to their great burst of joy and hope, as
  they ran riot in their new-found inheritance, from which they had so
  long been excluded. They flung themselves upon the world, as if they
  would "glut their sense" upon it.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i6">"Expend</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Easter Day</i>.</p>

  <p>But the very discovery that man is spirit, which is the source of
  all his rights, is also an implicit <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg093" id="pg093">093</a></span> discovery that he has outgrown the
  resources of the natural world. The infinite hunger of a soul cannot
  be satisfied with the things of sense. The natural world is too
  limited even for Carlyle's shoe-black; nor is it surprising that
  Byron should find it a waste, and dolefully proclaim his
  disappointment to much-admiring mankind. Now, both Carlyle and
  Browning apprehended the cause of the discontent, and both endured
  the Byronic utterance of it with considerable impatience. "Art thou
  nothing other than a vulture, then," asks the former, "that fliest
  through the universe seeking after somewhat <i>to eat,</i> and
  shrieking dolefully because carrion enough is not given thee? Close
  thy Byron, open thy Goethe."</p>

  <p>But Carlyle was always more able to detect the disease than to
  suggest the remedy. He had, indeed, "a glimpse of it." "There is in
  man a Higher than love of Happiness: he can do without Happiness, and
  instead thereof find Blessedness." But the glimpse was misleading,
  for it penetrated no further than the first negative step. The
  "Everlasting Yea" was, after all, only a deeper "No!" only
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg094" id="pg094">094</a></span>
  <i>Entsagung</i>, renunciation: "the fraction of life can be
  increased in value not so much by increasing your numerator as by
  lessening your denominator." Blessed alone is he that expecteth
  nothing. The holy of holies, where man hears whispered the mystery of
  life, is "the sanctuary of sorrow." "What Act of Legislature was
  there that <i>thou</i> shouldst be Happy? A little while ago thou
  hadst no right to <i>be</i> at all. What if thou wert born and
  predestined not to be Happy, but to be Unhappy? Nay, is not 'life
  itself a disease, knowledge the symptom of derangement'? Have not the
  poets sung 'Hymns to the Night' as if Night were nobler than Day; as
  if Day were but a small motley-coloured veil spread transiently over
  the infinite bosom of Night, and did but deform and hide from us its
  pure transparent eternal deeps." "We, the whole species of Mankind,
  and our whole existence and history, are but a floating speck in the
  illimitable ocean of the All ... borne this way and that way by its
  deep-swelling tides, and grand ocean currents, of which what faintest
  chance is there that we should ever exhaust the significance,
  ascertain the goings and comings? A region of Doubt, therefore,
  hovers for ever in the back-ground.... Only on a canvas of Darkness,
  such is man's way of being, could the many-coloured picture of our
  Life paint itself and shine."</p>

  <p>In such passages as these, there is far deeper pessimism than in
  anything which Byron could experience or express. Scepticism is
  directed by <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg095" id=
  "pg095">095</a></span> Carlyle, not against the natural elements of
  life&mdash;the mere sensuous outworks, but against the citadel of
  thought itself. Self-consciousness, or the reflecting interpretation
  by man of himself and his world, the very activity that lifts him
  above animal existence and makes him man, instead of being a divine
  endowment, is declared to be a disease, a poisonous subjectivity
  destructive of all good. The discovery that man is spirit and no
  vulture, which was due to Carlyle himself more than to any other
  English writer of his age, seemed, after all, to be a great calamity;
  for it led to the renunciation of happiness, and filled man with
  yearnings after a better than happiness, but left him nothing
  wherewith they might be satisfied, except "the duty next to hand."
  And the duty next to hand, as interpreted by Carlyle, is a means of
  suppressing by action, not idle speech only, but thought itself. But,
  if this be true, the highest in man is set against itself. And what
  kind of action remains possible to a "speck on the illimitable ocean,
  borne this way and that way by its deep-swelling tides"? "Here on
  earth we are soldiers, fighting in a foreign land; that understand
  not the plan of the campaign, and have no need to understand it,
  seeing what is at our hand to be done." But there is one element of
  still deeper gloom in this blind fighting; it is fought for a foreign
  cause. It is God's cause and not ours, or ours only in so far as it
  has been despotically imposed upon us; and it is hard to discover
  from Carlyle what interest we can have in the victory. Duty is to him
  a <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg096" id="pg096">096</a></span>
  menace&mdash;like the duty of a slave, were that possible. It lacks
  the element which alone can make it imperative to a free being,
  namely, that it be recognized as <i>his</i> good, and that the outer
  law become his inner motive. The moral law is rarely looked at by
  Carlyle as a beneficent revelation, and still more rarely as the
  condition which, if fulfilled, will reconcile man with nature and
  with God. And consequently, he can draw little strength from
  religion; for it is only love that can cast out fear.</p>

  <p>To sum up all in a word, Carlyle regarded evil as having
  penetrated into the inmost recesses of man's being. Thought was
  disease; morality was blind obedience to a foreign authority;
  religion was awe of an Unknowable, with whom man can claim no
  kinship. Man's nature was discovered to be spiritual, only on the
  side of its Wants. It was an endowment of a hunger which nothing
  could satisfy&mdash;not the infinite, because it is too great, not
  the finite, because it is too little; not God, because He is too far
  above man, not nature, because it is too far beneath him. We are
  unable to satisfy ourselves with the things of sense, and are also
  "shut out of the heaven of spirit." What have been called, "the three
  great terms of thought"&mdash;the World, Self, and God&mdash;have
  fallen asunder in his teaching. It is the difficulty of reconciling
  these which brings despair, while optimism is evidently the
  consciousness of their harmony.</p>

  <p>Now, these evils which reflection has revealed, and which are so
  much deeper than those of mere sensuous <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg097" id="pg097">097</a></span> disappointment,
  can only be removed by deeper reflection. The harmony of the world of
  man's experience, which has been broken by "the comprehensive curse
  of sceptical despair," can, as Goethe teaches us, be restored only by
  thought&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i2">"In thine own soul, build it up again."</p>
  </div>

  <p>The complete refutation of Carlyle's pessimistic view can only
  come, by reinterpreting each of the contradicting terms in the light
  of a higher conception. We must have a deeper grasp and a new view of
  the Self, the World, and God. And such a view can be given adequately
  only by philosophy. Reason alone can justify the faith that has been
  disturbed by reflection, and re-establish its authority.</p>

  <p>How, then, it may be asked, can a poet be expected to turn back
  the forces of a scepticism, which have been thus armed with the
  weapons of dialectic? Can anything avail in this region except
  explicit demonstration? A poet never demonstrates, but perceives; art
  is not a process, but a result; truth for it is immediate, and it
  neither admits nor demands any logical connection of ideas. The
  standard-bearers and the trumpeters may be necessary to kindle the
  courage of the army and to lead it on to victory, but the fight must
  be won by the thrust of sword and pike. Man needs more than the
  intuitions of the great poets, if he is to maintain solid possession
  of the truth.</p>

  <p>Now, I am prepared to admit the force of this objection, and I
  shall endeavour in the sequel to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg098" id="pg098">098</a></span> prove that, in order to establish
  optimism, more is needed than Browning can give, even when
  interpreted in the most sympathetic way. His doctrine is offered in
  terms of art, and it cannot have any demonstrative force without
  violating the limits of art. In some of his poems, however,&mdash;for
  instance, in <i>La Saisiaz, Ferishtatis Fancies</i> and the
  <i>Parleyings</i>, Browning sought to advance definite proofs of the
  theories which he held. He appears before us at times armed
  <i>cap-à-pie,</i> like a philosopher. Still, it is not when he argues
  that Browning proves: it is when he sees, as a poet sees. It is not
  by means of logical demonstrations that he helps us to meet the
  despair of Carlyle, or contributes to the establishment of a better
  faith. Browning's proofs are least convincing when he was most aware
  of his philosophical presuppositions; and a philosophical critic
  could well afford to agree with the critic of art, in relegating the
  demonstrating portions of his poems to the chaotic limbo lying
  between philosophy and poetry.</p>

  <p>When, however, he forgets his philosophy, and speaks as poet and
  religious man, when he is dominated by that sovereign thought which
  gave unity to his life-work, and which, therefore, seemed to lie
  deeper in him than the necessities of his art and to determine his
  poetic function, his utterances have a far higher significance. For
  he so lifts the artistic object into the region of pure thought, and
  makes sense and reason so to interpenetrate, that the old metaphors
  of "the noble lie" and "the truth beneath the veil" seem no longer to
  help. He <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg099" id=
  "pg099">099</a></span> seems to show us the truth so vividly and
  simply, that we are less willing to make art and philosophy mutually
  exclusive, although their methods differ. Like some of the greatest
  philosophers, and notably Plato and Hegel, he constrains us to doubt,
  whether the distinction penetrates low beneath the surface; for
  philosophy, too, when at its best, is a thinking of things together.
  In their light we begin to ask, whether it is not possible that the
  interpretation of the world in terms of spirit, which is the common
  feature of both Hegel's philosophy and Browning's poetry, does not
  necessarily bring with it a settlement of the ancient feud between
  these two modes of thought.</p>

  <p>But, in any case, Browning's utterances, especially those which he
  makes when he is most poet and least philosopher, have something of
  the convincing impressiveness of a reasoned system of optimism. And
  this comes, as already suggested, from his loyalty to a single idea,
  which gives unity to all his work. That idea we may, in the end, be
  obliged to treat not only as a hypothesis&mdash;for all principles of
  reconciliation, even those of the sciences, as long as knowledge is
  incomplete, must be regarded as hypotheses&mdash;but also as a
  hypothesis which he had no right to assume. It may be that in the end
  we shall be obliged to say of him, as of so many others&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"See the sage, with the hunger for the truth,</p>

    <p>And see his system that's all true, except</p>

  <p>It may be that the religious form, through which he generally
  reaches his convictions, is not freed from a dogmatic element, which
  so penetrates his thought as to vitiate it as a philosophy.
  Nevertheless, it answered for the poet all the uses of a philosophy,
  and it may do the same for many who are distrustful of the systems of
  the schools, and who are "neither able to find a faith nor to do
  without one." It contains far-reaching hints of a reconciliation of
  the elements of discord in our lives, and a suggestion of a way in
  which it may be demonstrated, that an optimistic theory is truer to
  facts than any scepticism or agnosticism, with the despair that they
  necessarily bring.</p>

  <p>For Browning not only advanced a principle, whereby, as he
  conceived, man might again be reconciled to the world and God, and
  all things be viewed as the manifestation of a power that is
  benevolent; he also sought to apply his principle to the facts of
  life. He illustrates his fundamental hypothesis by means of these
  facts; and he tests its validity with the persistence and impressive
  candour of a scientific investigator. His optimism is not that of an
  eclectic, who can ignore inconvenient difficulties. It is not an
  attempt to justify the whole by neglecting details, or to make wrong
  seem right by reference to a far-off result, in which the steps of
  the process are forgotten. He stakes the value of his view of life on
  its power to meet <i>all</i> facts; one fact, ultimately
  irreconcilable with his hypothesis, will, he knows, destroy
  it.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg101" id=

  <p>Consequently, there is a defiant and aggressive element in his
  attitude. Strengthened with an unfaltering faith in the supreme Good,
  this knight of the Holy Spirit goes forth over all the world seeking
  out wrongs. "He has," said Dr. Westcott, "dared to look on the
  darkest and meanest forms of action and passion, from which we
  commonly and rightly turn our eyes, and he has brought back for us
  from this universal survey a conviction of hope." I believe, further,
  that it was in order to justify this conviction that he set out on
  his quest. His interest in vice&mdash;in malice, cruelty, ignorance,
  brutishness, meanness, the irrational perversity of a corrupt
  disposition, and the subtleties of philosophic and aesthetic
  falsehood&mdash;was no morbid curiosity. Browning was no "painter of
  dirt"; no artist can portray filth for filth's sake, and remain an
  artist. He crowds his pages with criminals, because he sees deeper
  than their crimes. He describes evil without "palliation or reserve,"
  and allows it to put forth all its might, in order that he may, in
  the end, show it to be subjected to God's purposes. He confronts evil
  in order to force it to give up the good, which is all the reality
  that is in it. He conceives it as his mission to prove that evil is
  "stuff for transmuting," and that there is nought in the
  world.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg103" id=

  <p>He goes forth in the might of his faith in the power of good, as

  <p>The superabundant strength of Browning's conviction in the
  supremacy of the good, which led him in <i>The Ring and the Book</i>
  to depict criminals at their worst, forced him later on in his life
  to exhibit evil in another form. The real meaning <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg105" id="pg105">105</a></span> and value of such
  poems as <i>Fifine at the Fair, Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau, Red
  Cotton Nightcap Country, Ferishtah's Francies</i>, and others, can
  only be determined by a careful and complete analysis of each of
  them. But they have one characteristic so prominent, and so new in
  poetry, that the most careless reader cannot fail to detect it.
  Action and dramatic treatment give place to a discussion which is
  metaphysical; instead of the conflict of motives within a character,
  the stress and strain of passion and will in collision with
  circumstances, there is reflection on action after it has passed, and
  the conflict of subtle arguments on the ethical value of motives and
  ways of conduct, which the ordinary moral consciousness condemns
  without hesitation. All agree that these poems represent a new
  departure in poetry, and some consider that in them the poet, in thus
  dealing with metaphysical abstractions, has overleapt the boundaries
  of the poetic art. To such critics, this later period seems the
  period of his decadence, in which the casuistical tendencies, which
  had already appeared in <i>Bishop Blougram's Apology, Mr. Sludge the
  Medium</i>, and other poems, have overwhelmed his art, and his
  intellect, in its pride of strength, has grown wanton. <i>Fifine at
  the Fair is</i> said to be "a defence of inconstancy, or of the right
  of experiment in love." Its hero, who is "a modern gentleman, a
  refined, cultured, musical, artistic and philosophic person, of high
  attainments, lofty aspirations, strong emotions, and capricious
  will," produces arguments "wide in range, of profound <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg106" id="pg106">106</a></span> significance and
  infinite ingenuity," to defend and justify immoral intercourse with a
  gipsy trull. The poem consists of the speculations of a libertine,
  who coerces into his service truth and sophistry, and "a
  superabounding wealth of thought and imagery," and with no further
  purpose on the poet's part than the dramatic delineation of
  character. <i>Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i> is spoken of in a
  similar manner as the justification, by reference to the deepest
  principles of morality, of compromise, hypocrisy, lying, and a
  selfishness that betrays every cause to the individual's meanest
  welfare. The object of the poet is "by no means to prove black white,
  or white black, or to make the worse appear the better reason, but to
  bring a seeming monster and perplexing anomaly under the common laws
  of nature, by showing how it has grown to be what it is, and how it
  can with more or less self-delusion reconcile itself to itself."</p>

  <p>I am not able to accept this as a complete explanation of the
  intention of the poet, except with reference to <i>Prince
  Hohenstiel-Schwangau.</i> The <i>Prince</i> is a psychological study,
  like <i>Mr. Sludge the Medium,</i> and <i>Bishop Blougram</i>. No
  doubt he had the interest of a dramatist in the hero of <i>Fifine at
  the Fair</i> and in the hero of <i>Red Cotton Nightcap Country;</i>
  but, in these poems, his dramatic interest is itself determined by an
  ethical purpose, which is equally profound. His meeting with the
  gipsy at Pornic, and the spectacle of her unscrupulous audacity in
  vice, not only "sent his fancy roaming," but opened <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg107" id="pg107">107</a></span> out before him
  the fundamental problems of life. What I would find, therefore, in
  <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> is not the casuistic defence of an artistic
  and speculative libertine, but an earnest attempt on the part of the
  poet to prove,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"That, through the outward sign, the inward grace allures,</p>

    <p>And sparks from heaven transpierce earth's coarsest
    covertures,&mdash;</p>

    <p>All by demonstrating the value of Fifine."<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>, xxviii.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Within his scheme of the universal good he seeks to find a place
  even for this gipsy creature, who traffics "in just what we most
  pique us that we keep." Having, in the <i>Ring and the Book</i>,
  challenged evil at its worst as it manifests itself practically in
  concrete characters and external action, and having wrung from it the
  victory of the good, in <i>Fifine</i> and in his other later poems he
  meets it again in the region of dialectic. In this sphere of
  metaphysical ethics, evil has assumed a more dangerous form,
  especially for an artist. His optimistic faith has driven the poet
  into a realm into which poetry never ventured before. His battle is
  now, not with flesh and blood, but with the subtler powers of
  darkness grown vocal and argumentative, and threatening to turn the
  poet's faith in good into a defence of immorality, and to justify the
  worst evil by what is highest of all. Having indicated in outward
  fact "the need," as well as the "transiency of sin and death," he
  seeks here to prove that need, and seems, thereby, to degrade the
  highest truth of religion into a defence of the worst
  wickedness.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg108" id=
  "pg108">108</a></span>

  <p>No doubt the result is sufficiently repulsive to the abstract
  moralist, who is apt to find in <i>Fifine</i> nothing but a
  casuistical and shameless justification of evil, which is blasphemy
  against goodness itself. We are made to "discover," for instance,
  that</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i14">"There was just</p>

    <p>Enough and not too much of hate, love, greed and lust,</p>

    <p>Could one discerningly but hold the balance, shift</p>

  </div>

  <p>Confronted with such utterances as these, it is only natural that,
  rather than entangle the poet in them, we should regard them as the
  sophistries of a philosophical Don Juan, powerful enough, under the
  stress of self-defence, to confuse the distinctions of right and
  wrong. But, as we shall try to show in the next chapter, such an
  apparent justification of evil cannot be avoided by a reflective
  optimist; and it is implicitly contained even in those religious
  utterances of <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra, Christmas Eve</i>, and <i>A Death in
  the Desert</i>, with which we not only identify the poet but
  ourselves, in so far as we share his faith that</p><span class=

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"God's in His heaven,&mdash;</p>

    <p>All's right with the world."</p>
  </div>

  <p>The poet had far too much speculative acumen to be ignorant of
  this, and too much boldness and strength of conviction in the might
  of the good, to refuse to confront the issues that sprang from it. In
  his later poems, as in his earlier ones, he is endeavouring to
  justify the ways of God to man; and the difficulties which surround
  him are not those of a casuist, but the stubborn questionings of a
  spirit, whose religious faith is thoroughly earnest and fearless. To
  a spirit so loyal to the truth, and so bold to follow its leading,
  the suppression of such problems is impossible; and, consequently, it
  was inevitable that he should use the whole strength of his dialectic
  to try those fundamental principles, on which the moral life of man
  is based. And it is this, I believe, which we find in <i>Fifine</i>,
  as in <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i> and the <i>Parleyings</i>; not an
  exhibition of the argumentative subtlety of a mind whose strength has
  become lawless, and which spends itself in intellectual gymnastics,
  that have no place within the realm of either the beautiful or the
  true.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg110" id=

    <p>A: <i>All's Well that Ends Well</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>I have tried to show that one of the ruling conceptions of
  Browning's view of life is that the Good is absolute, and that it
  reveals itself in all the events of human life. By means of this
  conception, he endeavoured to bring together the elements which had
  fallen asunder in the sensational and moral pessimism of Byron and
  Carlyle. In other words, through the re-interpreting power which lies
  in this fundamental thought when it is soberly held and fearlessly
  applied, he sought to reconcile man with the world and with God, and
  thereby with himself. And the governing motive, whether the conscious
  motive or not, of Browning's poetry, the secret impulse which led him
  to dramatise the conflicts and antagonisms of human life, was the
  necessity of finding in them evidence of the presence of this
  absolute Good.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg111" id=
  "pg111">111</a></span>

  <p>Browning's optimism was deep and comprehensive enough to reject
  all compromise. His faith in the good seemed to rise with the demands
  that were made upon it by the misery and wickedness of man, and the
  apparently purposeless waste of life and its resources. There was in
  it a deliberate earnestness which led him to grapple, not only with
  the concrete difficulties of individual life, but with those also
  that spring from reflection and theory.</p>

  <p>The test of a philosophic optimism, as of any optimism which is
  more than a pious sentiment, must finally lie in its power to reveal
  the presence of the good in actual individual evils. But there are
  difficulties still nearer than those presented by concrete facts,
  difficulties arising out of the very suggestion that evil is a form
  of good. Such speculative difficulties must be met by a reflective
  mind, before it can follow out the application of an optimistic
  theory to particular facts. Now, Browning's creed, at least as he
  held it in his later years, was not merely the allowable exaggeration
  of an ecstatic religious sentiment, the impassioned conviction of a
  God-intoxicated man. It was deliberately presented as a solution of
  moral problems, and was intended to serve as a theory of the
  spiritual nature of things. It is, therefore, justly open to the same
  kind of criticism as that to which a philosophic doctrine is exposed.
  The poet deprived himself of the refuge, legitimate enough to the
  intuitive method of art, when, in his later works, he not only
  offered a dramatic solution of the problem of life, but <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg112" id="pg112">112</a></span> definitely
  attempted to meet the difficulties of speculative ethics.</p>

  <p>In this chapter I shall point out some of these difficulties, and
  then proceed to show how the poet proposed to solve them.</p>

  <p>A thorough-going optimism, in that it subdues all things to the
  idea of the supreme Good, and denies to evil the right even to
  dispute the absoluteness of its sway, naturally seems to imply a
  pantheistic theory of the world. And Browning's insistence on the
  presence of the highest in all things may easily be regarded as a
  mere revival of the oldest and crudest attempts at finding their
  unity in God. For if <i>all</i>, as he says, is for the best, there
  seems to be no room left for the differences apparent in the world,
  and the variety which gives it beauty and worth. Particular
  existences would seem to be illusory and evanescent phenomena, the
  creations of human imagination, itself a delusive appearance. The
  infinite, on this view, stands over against the finite, and it
  overpowers and consumes it; and the optimism, implied in the phrase
  that "God is all," turns at once into a pessimism. For, as soon as we
  inquire into the meaning of this "all," we find that it is only a
  negation of everything we can know or be. Such a pantheism as this is
  self-contradictory; for, while seeming to level all things upwards to
  a manifestation of the divine, it really levels all downwards to the
  level of mere unqualified being, a stagnant and empty unknowable. It
  leaves only a choice <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg113" id=
  "pg113">113</a></span> between akosmism and atheism, and, at the same
  time, it makes each of the alternatives impossible. For, in
  explaining the world it abolishes it, and in abolishing the world it
  empties itself of all signification; so that the Godhood which it
  attempts to establish throughout the whole realm of being, is found
  to mean nothing. "It is the night, in which all cows are black."</p>

  <p>The optimistic creed, which the poet strove to teach, must,
  therefore, not only establish the immanence of God, but show in some
  way how such immanence is consistent with the existence of particular
  things. His doctrine that there is no failure, or folly, or
  wickedness, or misery, but conceals within it, at its heart, a divine
  element; that there is no incident in human history which is not a
  pulsation of the life of the highest, and which has not its place in
  a scheme of universal good, must leave room for the moral life of
  man, and all the risks which morality brings with it. Otherwise,
  optimism is impossible. For a God who, in filling the universe with
  His presence, encroaches on the freedom and extinguishes the
  independence of man, precludes the possibility of all that is best
  for man&mdash;namely, moral achievement. Life, deprived of its moral
  purpose, is worthless to the poet, and so, in consequence, is all
  that exists in order to maintain that life. Optimism and ethics seem
  thus to come into immediate collision. The former, finding the
  presence of God in all things, seems to leave no room for man; and
  the latter seems to set man to <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg114"
  id="pg114">114</a></span> work out his own destiny in solitude, and
  to give him supreme and absolute authority over his own life; so that
  any character which he forms, be it good or bad, is entirely the
  product of his own activity. So far as his life is culpable or
  praiseworthy, in other words, so far as we pass any moral judgment
  upon it, we necessarily think of it as the revelation of a self, that
  is, of an independent will, which cannot divide its responsibility.
  There may be, and indeed there always is for every individual, a
  hereditary predisposition and a soliciting environment, tendencies
  which are his inheritance from a remote past, and which rise to the
  surface in his own life; in other words, the life of the individual
  is always led within the larger sweep of the life of humanity. He is
  part of a whole, and has his place fixed, and his function
  predetermined, by a power which is greater than his own. But, if we
  are to call him good or evil, if he is to aspire and repent and
  strive, in a word, if he is to have any <i>moral</i> character, he
  cannot be merely a part of a system; there must be something within
  him which is superior to circumstances, and which makes him master of
  his own fate. His natural history may begin with the grey dawn of
  primal being, but his moral history begins with himself, from the
  time when he first reacted upon the world in which he is placed, and
  transformed his natural relations into will and character. For who
  can be responsible for what he did not will? What could a moral
  imperative mean, what could an "ought" signify, to a being who was
  only a <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg115" id=
  "pg115">115</a></span> temporary embodiment of forces, who are prior
  to, and independent of himself? It would seem, therefore, as if
  morality were irreconcilable with optimism. The moral life of man
  cannot be the manifestation of a divine benevolence whose purpose is
  necessary; it is a trust laid upon himself, which he may either
  violate or keep. It surpasses divine goodness, "tho' matched with
  equal power" to <i>make</i> man good, as it has made the flowers
  beautiful. From this point of view, spiritual attainment, whether
  intellectual or moral, is man's own, a spontaneous product. Just as
  God is conceived as all in all in the universe, so man is all in all
  within the sphere of duty; for the kingdom of heaven is within. In
  both cases alike, there is absolute exclusion of external
  interference.</p>

  <p>For this reason, it has often seemed both to philosophers and
  theologians, as if the world were too confined to hold within it both
  God and man. In the East, the consciousness of the infinite seemed at
  times to leave no room for the finite; and in the West, where the
  consciousness of the finite and interest therein is strongest, and
  man strives and aspires, a Deism arose which set God at a distance,
  and allowed Him to interfere in the fate of man only by a benevolent
  miracle. Nor is this collision of pantheism and freedom, nay of
  religion and morality, confined to the theoretical region. This
  difficulty is not merely the punishment of an over-bold and
  over-ambitious philosophy, which pries too curiously into the mystery
  of being. It lies <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg116" id=
  "pg116">116</a></span> at the very threshold of all reflection on the
  facts of the moral life. Even children feel the mystery of God's
  permitting sin, and embarrass their helpless parents with the
  contradiction between absolute benevolence and the miseries and
  cruelties of life. "A vain interminable controversy," says
  Teufels-dröckh, "which arises in every soul since the beginning of
  the world: and in every soul, that would pass from idle suffering
  into actual endeavouring, must be put an end to. The most, in our own
  time, have to go content with a simple, incomplete enough Suppression
  of this controversy: to a few Solution of it is indispensable."</p>

  <p>Solution, and not Suppression, is what Browning sought; he did, in
  fact, propound a solution, which, whether finally satisfactory or
  not, at least carries us beyond the easy compromises of ordinary
  religious and ethical teaching. He does not deny the universality of
  God's beneficence or power, and divide the realm of being between Him
  and the adversary: nor, on the other hand, does he limit man's
  freedom, and stultify ethics by extracting the sting of reality from
  sin. To limit God, he knew, was to deny Him; and, whatever the
  difficulties he felt in regarding the absolute Spirit as realising
  itself in man, he could not be content to reduce man into a temporary
  phantom, an evanescent embodiment of "spiritual" or natural forces,
  that take a fleeting form in him as they pursue their onward way.</p>

  <p>Browning held with equal tenacity to the idea of a <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg117" id="pg117">117</a></span> universal
  benevolent order, and to the idea of the moral freedom of man within
  it. He was driven in opposite directions by two beliefs, both of
  which he knew to be essential to the life of man as spirit, and both
  of which he illustrates throughout his poems with an endless variety
  of poetic expression. He endeavoured to find God in man and still to
  leave man free. His optimistic faith sought reconciliation with
  morality. The vigour of his ethical doctrine is as pre-eminent, as
  the fulness of his conviction of the absolute sway of the Good. Side
  by side with his doctrine that there is no failure, no wretchedness
  of corruption that does not conceal within it a germ of goodness, is
  his sense of the evil of sin, of the infinite earnestness of man's
  moral warfare, and of the surpassing magnitude of the issues at stake
  for each individual soul. So powerful is his interest in man as a
  moral agent, that he sees nought else in the world of any deep
  concern. "My stress lay," he said in his preface to <i>Sordello</i>
  (1863), "on the incidents in the development of a soul: little else
  is worth study. I, at least, always thought so&mdash;you, with many
  known and unknown to me, think so&mdash;others may one day think so."
  And this development of a soul is not at any time regarded by the
  poet as a peaceful process, like the growth of a plant or animal.
  Although he thinks of the life of man as the gradual realization of a
  divine purpose within him, he does not suppose it to take place in
  obedience to a tranquil necessity. Man advances morally by fighting
  his way inch by inch, and he gains nothing except <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg118" id="pg118">118</a></span> through conflict.
  He does not become good as the plant grows into maturity. "The
  kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by
  force."</p>

  <p>Man is no idle spectator of the conflict of the forces of right
  and wrong; Browning never loses the individual in the throng, or
  sinks him into his age or race. And although the poet ever bears
  within him the certainty of victory for the good, he calls his
  fellows to the fight as if the fate of all hung on the valour of
  each. The struggle is always personal, individual like the duels of
  the Homeric heroes.</p>

  <p>It is under the guise of warfare that morality always presents
  itself to Browning. It is not a mere equilibrium of
  qualities&mdash;the measured, self-contained, statuesque ethics of
  the Greeks, nor the asceticism and self-restraint of Puritanism, nor
  the peaceful evolution of Goethe's artistic morality: it is valour in
  the battle of life. His code contains no negative commandments, and
  no limitations; but he bids each man let out all the power that is
  within him, and throw himself upon life with the whole energy of his
  being. It is better even to seek evil with one's whole mind, than to
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg119" id="pg119">119</a></span> be

  <p>If there be any concrete form of evil with which the poet's

  of a life that is loyal to nothing, not even to its own selfishness.

  <p>For the bold sinner, who chooses and sustains his part to the end,
  the poet has hope. Indeed, the resolute choice is itself the
  beginning of hope; for, let a man only give <i>himself</i> to
  anything, wreak <i>himself</i> on the world in the intensity of his
  hate, set all sail before the gusts of passion and "range from Helen
  to Elvire, frenetic to be free," let him rise into a decisive
  self-assertion against the stable order of the moral world, and he
  cannot fail to discover the nature of the task he has undertaken, and
  the meaning of the power without, against which he has set himself.
  If there be sufficient strength in a man to vent himself in action,
  and "try conclusions with the world," he will then learn that it has
  another destiny than to be the instrument of evil. Self-assertion
  taken by itself is good; indeed, it is the very law of every life,

  <p>Thus it is the decisive deed that gains the poet's approval. He
  finds the universe a great plot against a pied morality. Even Guido
  claims some kind of regard from him, since "hate," as Pompilia said,
  "was the truth of him." In that very hate we find, beneath his
  endless subterfuges, something real, at last. And since, through his
  hate, he is frankly measuring his powers against the good at work in
  the world, there cannot remain any doubt of the issue. To bring the
  rival forces face to face is just what is wanted.</p>

  <p>Everywhere Browning's ethical teaching has this characteristic
  feature of vigorous decisiveness. As Dr. Westcott has said, "No room
  is left for indifference or neutrality. There is no surrender to an
  idle optimism. A part must be taken and maintained. The spirit in
  which Luther said '<i>Pecca fortiter</i>' finds in him powerful
  expression." Browning is emphatically the poet-militant, and the
  prophet of struggling manhood. His words are like trumpet-calls
  sounded in the van of man's struggle, wafted back by the winds, and
  heard through all the din of conflict by his meaner brethren, who are
  obscurely fighting for the good in the throng and crush of life. We
  catch the tones of this heart-strengthening music in the earliest
  poems he sung: nor did his courage fail, or vigour wane, as the
  shades of night gathered round him. In the latest of all his poems,
  he still speaks of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"One who never turned his back but marched breast forward,</p>

    <p class="i2">Never doubted clouds would break,</p>

    <p>Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would

  <p>These are fit words to close such a life. His last act is a kind

  forth on a new war under new conditions and in lands unknown, by a
  heroic man who is sure of himself and sure of his cause.</p>

  <p>But now comes the great difficulty. How can the poet combine such
  earnestness in the moral struggle with so deep a conviction of the
  ultimate nothingness of evil, and of the complete victory of the
  good? Again and again we have found him pronounce such victory to be
  absolutely necessary and inevitable. His belief in God, his trust in
  His love and might, will brook no limit anywhere. His conviction is
  that the power of the good subjects evil itself to its authority.</p>

  <p>finds its echo in every devout spirit from the beginning of the
  world: it is of the very essence of religion. But what of its moral
  consequences? Religion, when thoroughly consistent, is the triumphant
  reconciliation of all contradictions. It is optimism, the
  justification of things as the process of evolving the good; and its
  peace and joy are just the outcome of the conviction, won by faith,
  that the ideal is actual, and that every detail of life is, in its
  own place, illumined with divine goodness. But morality is the
  condemnation of things as they are, by reference to a conception of a
  good which ought to be. The absolute identification of the actual and
  ideal extinguishes morality, either in something lower or something
  higher. But the moral ideal, when reached, turns at once into a
  stepping-stone, a dead self; and the good formulates itself anew as
  an ideal in the future. So that morality is the sphere of
  discrepancy, and the moral life a progressive realization
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg129" id="pg129">129</a></span> of a
  good that can never be complete. It would thus seem to be
  irreconcilably different from religion, which must, in some way or
  other, find the good to be present, actual, absolute, without shadow
  of change, or hint of limit or imperfection.</p>

  <p>How, then, does the poet deal with the apparently fundamental
  discrepancy between religion, which postulates the absolute and
  universal supremacy of God, and morality, which postulates the
  absolute supremacy of man within the sphere of his own action, in so
  far as it is called right or wrong?</p>

  <p>This difficulty, in one or other of its forms, is, perhaps, the
  most pressing in modern philosophy. It is the problem of the
  possibility of rising above the "Either, Or" of discrepant
  conceptions, to a position which grasps the alternatives together in
  a higher idea. It is at bottom the question, whether we can have a
  philosophy at all; or whether we must fall back once more into
  compromise, and the scepticism and despair which it always brings
  with it.</p>

  <p>It is just because Browning does not compromise between the
  contending truths that he is instructive. The value of his solution
  of the problem corresponds accurately to the degree in which he holds
  both the absoluteness of God's presence in history, and the complete
  independence of the moral consciousness. He refused to degrade either
  God or man. In the name of religion, he refuses to say that "a
  purpose of reason is visible in the social and legal structures of
  mankind"&mdash;<i>only</i> "on <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg130"
  id="pg130">130</a></span> the whole "; and in the name of morality,
  he refuses to "assert the perfection of the actual world" as it is,
  and by implication to stultify all human endeavour. He knew the vice
  of compromising, and strove to hold both the truths in their
  fulness.</p>

  <p>That he did not compromise God's love or power, and make it
  dominant merely "on the whole," leaving within His realm, which is
  universal, a limbo for the "lost," is evident to the most casual
  reader.</p>

  <p>Another ordinary view, according to which evil is
  self-destructive, and ends with the annihilation of its servant, he
  does not so decisively reject. At least, in a passage of wonderful
  poetic and philosophic power, which he puts into the mouth of
  Caponsacchi, he describes Guido as gradually lapsing towards
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg131" id="pg131">131</a></span> the
  chaos, which is lower then created existence. He observes him</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>But the matchless moral insight of the Pope leads to a different
  conclusion, and the poet again retrieves his faith. The Pope puts his
  first trust "in the suddenness of Guido's fate," and hopes that the
  truth may "be flashed out by the blow of death, and Guido see one
  instant and be saved." Nor is his trust vain. "The end comes," said
  Dr. Westcott. "The ministers of death claim him. In his agony he
  summons every helper whom he has known or heard of&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>
    "'Abate,&mdash;Cardinal,&mdash;Christ,&mdash;Maria,&mdash;God&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"In this supreme moment he has known what love is, and, knowing it,
  has begun to feel it. The cry, like the intercession of the rich man
  in Hades, is a promise of a far-off deliverance."</p>

  <p>But even beyond this hope, which is the last for most men, the
  Pope had still another.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Else I avert my face, nor follow him</p>

  <p>This phrase, "which must not be," seems to me to carry in it the
  irrefragable conviction of the poet himself. The same faith in the
  future appears in the words in which Pompilia addresses her

    <p>"O lover of my life, O soldier-saint,</p>

    <p>No work begun shall ever pause for death!</p>

  <p>For the poet, the death of man brings no change in the purpose of
  God; nor does it, or aught else, fix a limit to His power, or
  stultify by failure the end implied in all God's work, nature no less
  than man himself&mdash;to wit, that every soul shall learn the lesson
  of goodness, and reflect the devine life in desire, intelligence, and
  will.</p>

  <p>Equally emphatic, on some sides at least, is Browning's rejection
  of those compromises, with which the one-sided religious
  consciousness threatens the existence <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg133" id="pg133">133</a></span> of the moral life. At times,
  indeed, he seems to teach, as man's best and highest, a passive
  acquiescence in the divine benevolence; and he uses the dangerous
  metaphor of the clay and potter's wheel. <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i> bids
  us feel</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay";</p>
  </div>

  <p>and his prayer is,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"So, take and use Thy work:</p>

    <p>Amend what flaws may lurk,</p>

    <p>What strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim!</p>

    <p>My times be in Thy hand!</p>

  <p>But this attitude of quiescent trust, which is so characteristic
  of religion, is known by the poet to be only a phase of man's best
  life. It is a temporary resting-place for the pilgrim: "the country
  of Beulah, whose air is very sweet and pleasant, where he may solace
  himself for a season." But, "the way lies directly through it," and
  the pilgrim, "being a little strengthened and better able to bear his
  sickness," has to go forward on his journey. Browning's
  characteristic doctrine on this matter is not acquiescence and
  resignation. "Leave God the way" has, in his view, its counterpart
  and condition&mdash;"Have you the will!"</p>

  <p>The root of Browning's joy is in the need of progress towards an

    <p class="i4">"that man is hurled</p>

  <p>The bliss of endeavour, the infinite worth of the consciousness of
  failure, with its evidence of coming triumph, "the spark which
  disturbs our clod," these are the essence of his optimistic
  interpretation of human life, and also of his robust ethical
  doctrine.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Then, welcome each rebuff</p>

  <p>And he prolongs the battle beyond time, for the battle is the
  moral life and man's best, and therefore God's best in man. The
  struggle upward from the brute, may, indeed end with death. But this
  only means that man "has learned the uses of the flesh," and there
  are in him other potencies to evolve:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Other heights in other lives, God willing."</p>
  </div>

  <p>Death is the summing up of this life's meaning, stored strength
  for new adventure.</p>

  <p>"The future I may face now I have proved the past;" and, in view
  of it, Browning is</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Fearless and unperplexed</p>

    <p>When I wage battle next,</p>

    <p>What weapons to select, what armour to indue."</p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg135" id="pg135">135</a></span>

  <p>He is sure that it will be a battle, and a winning one. There is
  no limiting here of man's possibility, or confining of man's
  endeavour after goodness.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Strive and Thrive! cry 'Speed,' fight on, fare ever</p>

    <p>There as here,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>are the last words which came from his pen.</p>

  <p>Now, it may fairly be argued that these allusions to what death
  may mean, and what may lie beyond death, valuable as they may be as
  poetry, cannot help in philosophy. They do not solve the problem of
  the relation between morality and religion, but merely continue the
  antagonism between them into a life beyond, of which we have no
  experience. If the problem is to be solved, it must be solved as it
  is stated for us in the present world.</p>

  <p>This objection is valid, so far as it goes. But Browning's
  treatment is valuable all the same, in so far as it indicates his
  unwillingness to limit or compromise the conflicting truths. He, by
  implication, rejects the view, ordinarily held without being
  examined, that the moral life is preliminary to the joy and rest of
  religion; a brief struggle, to be followed by a sudden lift out of it
  into some serene sphere, where man will lead an angel's life, which
  knows no imperfection and therefore no growth. He refuses to make
  morality an accident in man's history and "to put man in the place of
  God," by identifying the process with the ideal; he also refuses to
  make man's struggle, and God's achievement <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg136" id="pg136">136</a></span> within man,
  mutually exclusive alternatives. As I shall show in the sequel,
  movement towards an ideal, actualizing but never actualized, is for
  the poet the very nature of man. And to speak about either God or man
  (or even the absolute philosopher) as "the last term of a
  development" has no meaning to him. We are not first moral and then
  religious, first struggling with evil and then conscious of
  overcoming it. God is with us in the battle, and the victory is in
  every blow.</p>

  <p>But there lies a deeper difficulty than this in the way of
  reconciling morality and religion, or the presence of both God and
  man in human action. Morality, in so far as it is achievement, might
  conceivably be immediately identified with the process of an absolute
  good; but morality is always a consciousness of failure as well. Its
  very essence and verve is the conviction that the ideal is not
  actual. And the higher a man's spiritual attainment, the more
  impressive is his view of the evil of the world, and of the greatness
  of the work pressing to be done. "Say not ye, there are yet four
  months, and then cometh harvest? Behold I say unto you, 'Lift up your
  eyes and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.'"
  It looks like blasphemy against morality to say "that God lives in
  eternity and has, therefore, plenty of time." Morality destroys one's
  contentment with the world; and its language seems to be, "God is not
  here, but there; the kingdom is still to come."</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg137" id="pg137">137</a></span>

  <p>Nor does it rest with condemning the world. It also finds flaws in
  its own highest achievement; so that we seem ever "To mock ourselves
  in all that's best of us." The beginning of the spiritual life seems
  just to consist in a consciousness of complete failure, and that
  consciousness ever grows deeper.</p>

  <p>This is well illustrated in Browning's account of Caponsacchi;
  from the time when Pompilia's smile first "glowed" upon him, and set
  him&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i8">"Thinking how my life</p>

  <p>The moral world with its illimitable horizon had Opened out around
  him, the voice of the new commandment bidding him "be perfect as his

  imperative a well nigh hopeless struggle; and, as he compares himself

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"O great, just, good God! Miserable Me!"</p>
  </div>

  <p>This humility and contrition, this discontent verging on
  hopelessness, constituted, as we have seen, the characteristic
  attitude of Carlyle; and it represents a true and, in fact, an
  indispensable element of man's moral life.</p>

  <p>But this self-condemnation in the face of the moral law is nothing
  more than an element, and must not be taken either for the whole
  truth or for the most fundamental one. It is because it is taken as
  fundamental and final that the discrepancy between morality and
  religion is held to be absolute, and the consciousness of evil is
  turned against faith in the Good. It is an abstract way of thinking
  that makes us deduce, from the transcendent height of the moral
  ideal, the impossibility of attaining goodness, and the failure of
  God's purpose in man. And this is what Carlyle did. He stopped short
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg139" id="pg139">139</a></span> at
  the consciousness of imperfection, and he made no attempt to account
  for it. He took it as a complete fact, and therefore drew a sharp
  line of distinction between the human and the divine. And, so far, he
  was right; for, if we look no further than this negative side, it is
  emphatically absurd to identify man, be he "philosopher" or not, with
  the Absolute. "Why callest thou Me good? there is none good save One,
  that is God." The "ought" <i>must</i> stand above <i>all</i> human
  attainment, and declare that "whatever is, is wrong." But whence
  comes the ought itself, the ideal which condemns us? Is it not also
  immanent in the fact it condemns?</p>

  <p>"Who is not acute enough," asks Hegel, "to see a great deal in his
  surroundings which is really far from being what it ought to be?" And
  who also, we may add, has not enough of the generalizing faculty,
  often mistaken for a philosophical one, to extend this condemnation
  over the whole of "this best of all possible worlds"? But what is
  this "ought-to-be," which has such potency in it that all things
  confronted with it lose their worth?</p>

  <p>The first answer is, that it is an idea which men, and
  particularly good men, carry with them. But a little consideration
  will show that it cannot be a mere idea. It must be something more
  valid than a capricious product of the individual imagination. For we
  cannot wisely condemn things because they do not happen to answer to
  any casual conception which we may choose to elevate into a
  criterion. A criterion must have objective validity. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg140" id="pg140">140</a></span> It must be an
  idea <i>of</i> something and not an empty notion; and that something
  must, at the worst, be possible. Nay, when we consider all that is
  involved in it, it becomes obvious that a true ideal&mdash;an ideal
  which is a valid criterion&mdash;must be not only possible but real,
  and, indeed, more real than that which is condemned by reference to
  it. Absolute pessimism has in it the same contradiction as absolute
  scepticism has,&mdash;in fact, it is only its practical counterpart;
  for both scepticism and pessimism involve the assumption that it is
  possible to reach a position outside the realm of being, from which
  it may be condemned as a whole. But the rift between actual and ideal
  must fall within the real or intelligible world, do what the
  pessimists will; and a condemnation of man which is not based on a
  principle realized by humanity, is a fiction of abstract thought,
  which lays stress on the actuality of the imperfect and treats the
  perfect as if it were as good as nothing, which it cannot be. In
  other words, this way of regarding human life isolates the passing
  phenomenon, and does not look to that which reveals itself in it and
  causes it to pass away. Confining ourselves, however, for the
  present, to the ideal in morality, we can easily see that, in that
  sphere at least, the actual and ideal change places; and that the
  latter contrasts with the former as the real with the phenomenal.
  For, in the first place, the moral ideal is something more than a
  mere idea not yet realized. It is more even than a <i>true</i> idea;
  for no mere knowledge, however true, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg141" id="pg141">141</a></span> has such intimate relation to the
  self-consciousness of man as his moral ideal. A mathematical axiom,
  and the statement of a physical law, express what is true; but they
  do not occupy the same place in our mind as a moral principle. Such a
  principle is an ideal, as well as an idea. It is an idea which has
  causative potency in it. It supplies motives, it is an incentive to
  action, and, though in one sense a thing of the future, it is also
  the actual spring and source of present activity. In so far as the
  agent acts, as Kant put it, not according to laws, but according to
  an <i>idea</i> of law (and a responsible agent always acts in this
  manner), the ideal is as truly actualized in him as the physical law
  is actualized in the physical fact, or the vegetable life in the
  plant. In fact, the ideal of a moral being is his life. All his
  actions are its manifestations. And, just as the physical fact is not
  seen as it really is, nor its reality proved, till science has
  penetrated through the husk of the sensuous phenomenon, and grasped
  it in thought as an instance of a law; so an individual's actions are
  not understood, and can have no moral meaning whatsoever, except in
  the light of the purpose which gave them being. We know the man only
  when we know his creed. His reality is what he believes in; that is,
  it is his ideal.</p>

  <p>It is the consciousness that the ideal is the real which explains
  the fact of contrition. To become morally awakened is to become
  conscious of the vanity and nothingness of the past life, as
  confronted with the new ideal implied in it. The past life is
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg142" id="pg142">142</a></span>
  something to be cast aside as false show, just because the self that
  experienced it was not realized in it. It is for this reason that the
  moral agent sets himself against it, and desires to annihilate all
  its claims upon him by undergoing its punishment, and drinking to the
  dregs its cup of bitterness. Thus his true life lies in the
  realization of his ideal, and his advance towards it is his coming to
  himself. Only in attaining to it does he attain reality, and the only
  realization possible for him in the present is just the consciousness
  of the potency of the ideal. To him to live is to realize his ideal.
  It is a power that irks, till it finds expression in moral habits
  that accord with its nature, <i>i.e.</i>, till the spirit has, out of
  its environment, created a body adequate to itself.</p>

  <p>The condemnation of self which characterizes all moral life and is
  the condition of moral progress, must not, therefore, be regarded as
  a complete truth. For the very condemnation implies the actual
  presence of something better. Both of the terms&mdash;both the
  criterion and the fact which is condemned by it&mdash;fall within the
  same individual life. Man cannot, therefore, without injustice,
  condemn himself in all that he is; for the condemnation is itself a
  witness to the activity of that good of which he despairs. Hence, the
  threatening majesty of the moral imperative is nothing but the shadow
  of man's own dignity; and moral contrition, and even the complete
  despair of the pessimistic theory, when rightly understood, are
  recognized as <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg143" id=
  "pg143">143</a></span> unwilling witnesses to the authority and the
  actuality of the highest good. And, on the other hand, the highest
  good cannot be regarded as a mere phantom, without nullifying all our
  condemnation of the self and the world.</p>

  <p>The legitimate deduction from the height of man's moral ideal is
  thus found to be, not, as Carlyle thought, the weakness and
  worthlessness of human nature, but its promise and native dignity:
  and in a healthy moral consciousness it produces, not despair, but
  faith and joy. For, as has been already suggested in a previous
  chapter, the authority of the moral law over man is rooted in man's
  endowment. Its imperative is nothing but the voice of the future
  self, bidding the present self aspire, while its reproof is only the
  expression of a moral aspiration which has misunderstood itself.
  Contrition is not a bad moral state which should bring despair, but a
  good state, full of promise of one that is still better. It is, in
  fact, just the first step which the ideal takes in its process of
  self-realization: "the sting that bids nor sit, nor stand, but
  go!"</p>

  <p>The moral ideal thus, like every other ideal, even that which we
  regard as present in natural life, contains a certain guarantee of
  its own fulfilment. It is essentially an active thing, an energy, a
  movement upwards. It may, indeed, be urged that the guarantee is
  imperfect. Ideals tend to self-realization, but the tendency may
  remain unfulfilled. Men have some ideals which they never reach, and
  others which, at first sight at least, it were better <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg144" id="pg144">144</a></span> for them not to
  reach. The goal may never be attained, or it may prove "a ruin like
  the rest." And, as long as man is moral, the ideal is not, and cannot
  be, fully reached. Morality necessarily implies a rift within human
  nature, a contradiction between what is and what ought to be;
  although neither the rift nor the contradiction is absolute. There
  might seem for this reason to be no way of bringing optimism and
  ethics together, of reconciling what is and what ought to be.</p>

  <p>My answer to these difficulties must at this stage be very brief
  and incomplete. That the moral good, if attained, should itself prove
  vain is a plain self-contradiction. For moral good has no meaning
  except in so far as it is conceived as the highest good. The
  question. "Why should I be moral," has no answer, because it is
  self-contradictory. The moral ideal contains its justification in
  itself, and requires to lean on nothing else.</p>

  <p>But it is not easy to prove that it is attainable. In one sense it
  is not attainable, at least under the conditions of human life which
  fall within our experience, from which alone we have a right to
  speak. For, as I shall strive to show in a succeeding chapter, the
  essence of man's life as spiritual, that is as intelligent and moral,
  is its self-realizing activity. Intellectual and moral life is
  progress, although it is the progress of an ideal which is real and
  complete, the return of the infinite to itself through the finite.
  The cessation of the progress of the ideal in man, whereby man
  interprets the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg145" id=
  "pg145">145</a></span> world in terms of himself and makes it the
  instrument of his purposes, is intellectual and moral death. From one
  point of view, therefore, this spiritual life, or moral and
  intellectual activity, is inspired at every step by the consciousness
  of a "beyond" not possessed, of an unsolved contradiction between the
  self and the not-self, of a good that ought to be and is not. The
  last word, or rather the last word <i>but one</i>, regarding man is
  "failure."</p>

  <p>But failure is the last word but one, as the poet well knew.
  "What's come to perfection perishes," he tells us. From this point of
  view the fact that perfection is not reached, merely means that the
  process is not ended. "It seethes with the morrow for us and more."
  The recognition of failure implies more effort and higher progress,
  and contains a suggestion of an absolute good, and even a proof of
  its active presence. "The beyond," for knowledge and morality, is the
  Land of Promise. And the promise is not a false one; for the "land"
  is possessed. The recognition of the fact to be known, the statement
  of the problem, is the first step in its solution; and the
  consciousness of the moral ideal not attained is the first step in
  its self-actualizing progress. Had man not come so far, he would not
  have known the further difficulty, or recognized the higher good. To
  say that the moral ideal is never attained, is thus only a
  half-truth. We must add to it the fact that it is always being
  attained; nay, that it is always present as an active reality,
  attaining itself, evolving its own content. Or, to <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg146" id="pg146">146</a></span> return to the
  previous metaphor, the land of promise is possessed, although the
  possession always reveals a still better beyond, which is again a
  land of promise.</p>

  <p>While, therefore, it must always remain true that knowledge does
  not reach absolute reality, nor morality absolute goodness, this
  cannot be used as an argument against optimism, except on the
  presupposition that mental and moral activity are a disease. And this
  is a contradiction in terms. If the ideal is in itself good, the
  process whereby it is attained is good; if the process in itself is
  evil, the ideal it seeks is evil, and therefore the condemnation of
  the actual by reference to it is absurd. And, on the other hand, to
  postulate as best the identity of ideal and actual, so that no
  process is necessary, is to assume a point of view where both
  optimism and pessimism are meaningless, for there is no criterion. As
  Aristotle teaches us, we have no right either to praise or to blame
  the highest. A process, such as morality is, which is not the
  self-manifestation of an actual idea, and an ideal which does not
  reveal its potencies in its passing forms, are both fictions of
  one-sided thought. The process is not the ideal, but its
  manifestation; and the ideal is not the process, but the principle
  which is its source and guide.</p>

  <p>But if the process cannot be thus immediately identified with the
  ideal, or "man take the place of God," or "human self-consciousness
  be confused with the absolute self-consciousness," far less can they
  be separated. The infinitely high ideal of <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg147" id="pg147">147</a></span> perfect knowledge
  and perfect goodness, implied in the Christian command, "Be ye
  perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect," is an ideal, just
  because the unity of what is and what ought to be is deeper than
  their difference. The recognition of the limit of our knowledge, or
  the imperfection of our moral character, is a direct witness to the
  fact that there is more to be known and a better to be achieved. The
  negative implies the affirmative, and is its effect. Man's confession
  of the limitation of his knowledge is made on the supposition that
  the universe of facts, in all its infinitely rich complexity, is
  meant to be known; and his confession of moral imperfection is made
  by reference to a good which is absolute, and which yet may be and
  ought to be his. The good in morality is necessarily supreme and
  perfect. A good that is "merely human," "relative to man's nature,"
  in the sense of not being true goodness, is a phantom of confused
  thinking. Morality demands "<i>the</i> good," and not a simulacrum or
  make-shift. The distinction between right and wrong, and with it all
  moral aspiration, contrition, and repentance, would otherwise become
  meaningless. What can a seeming good avail to a moral agent? There is
  no better or worse among merely apparent excellencies, and of
  phantoms it matters not which is chosen. And, in a similar way, the
  distinction between true and false in knowledge, and the common
  condemnation of human knowledge as merely of phenomena, implies the
  absolute unity of thought and being, and the knowledge of that
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg148" id="pg148">148</a></span> unity
  as a fact. There is no true or false amongst merely apparent
  facts.</p>

  <p>But, if the ideal of man as a spiritual being is conceived as
  perfect, then it follows not only that its attainment is possible,
  but that it is necessary. The guarantee of its own fulfilment which
  an ideal carries with it as an ideal, that is, as a potency in
  process of fulfilment, becomes complete when that ideal is absolute.
  "If God be for us, who can be against us?" The absolute good, in the
  language of Emerson, is "too good not to be true." If such an ideal
  be latent in the nature of man, it brings the order of the universe
  over to his side. For it implies a kinship between him, as a
  spiritual being, and the whole of existence. The stars in their
  courses fight for him. In other words, the moral ideal means nothing,
  if it does not imply a law which is universal. It is a law which
  exists already, whether man recognizes it or not; it is the might in
  things, a law of which "no jot or tittle can in any wise pass away."
  The individual does not institute the moral law; he finds it to be
  written both within and without him. His part is to recognize, not to
  create it; to make it valid in his own life and so to identify
  himself with it, that his service of it may be perfect freedom.</p>

  <p>We thus conclude that morality, and even the self-condemnation,
  contrition, and consciousness of failure which it brings with it as
  phases of its growth, are witnesses of the presence, and the actual
  product of an absolute good in man. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg149" id="pg149">149</a></span> Morality, in other words, rests
  upon, and is the self-evolution of the religious principle in
  man.</p>

  <p>A similar line of proof would show that religion implies morality.
  An absolute good is not conceivable, except in relation to the
  process whereby it manifests itself. In the language of theology, we
  may say that God must create and redeem the world in order to be God;
  or that creation and redemption,&mdash;the outflow of the universe
  from God as its source, and its return to Him through the salvation
  of mankind,&mdash;reveal to us the nature of God. Apart from this
  outgoing of the infinite to the finite and its return to itself
  through it, the name God would be an empty word, signifying a
  something unintelligible dwelling in the void beyond the realm of
  being. But religion, as we have seen, is the recognition not of an
  unknown but of the absolute good as real; the joyous consciousness of
  the presence of God in all things. And morality, in that it is the
  realization of an ideal which is perfect, is the process whereby the
  absolute good actualizes itself in man. It is true that the ideal
  cannot be identified with the process; for it is the principle of the
  process, and therefore more than it. Man does not reach "the last
  term of development," for there is no last term to a being whose
  essence is progressive activity. He does not therefore take the place
  of God, and his self-consciousness is never the absolute
  self-consciousness. But still, in so far as his life is a progress
  towards the true and good, it is the process of truth and goodness
  within <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg150" id=
  "pg150">150</a></span> him. It is the activity of the ideal. It is
  God lifting man up to Himself, or, in the language of philosophy,
  "returning to Himself in history." And yet it is at the same time
  man's effort after goodness. Man is not a mere "vessel of divine
  grace," or a passive recipient of the highest bounty. All man's
  goodness is necessarily man's achievement. And the realization by the
  ideal of itself is man's achievement of it. For it is his ideal. The
  law without is also the law within. It is the law within because it
  is recognized as the law without. Thus, the moral consciousness
  passes into the religious consciousness. The performance of duty is
  the willing service of the absolute good; and, as such, it involves
  also the recognition of a purpose that cannot fail. It is both
  activity and faith, both a struggle and a consciousness of victory,
  both morality and religion. We cannot, therefore, treat these as
  alternative phases of man's life. There is not first the pain of the
  moral struggle, and then the joy and rest of religion. The meat and
  drink is "to do the will of Him that sent Me, to finish His work."
  Heaven is the service of the good. "There is nothing in the world or
  out of it that can be called unconditionally good, except the good
  will." The process of willing&mdash;the moral activity&mdash;is its
  own reward; "the only jewel that shines in its own light."</p>

  <p>It may seem to some to be presumptuous thus to identify the divine
  and the human; but to separate them makes both morality and religion
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg151" id="pg151">151</a></span>
  impossible. It robs morality of its ideal, and makes God a mere name
  for the "unknown." Those who think that this identification degrades
  the divine, misapprehend the nature of spirit; and forget that it is
  of its essence to communicate itself. And goodness and truth do not
  become less when shared; they grow greater. Spiritual possessions
  imply community wherein there is no exclusion; and to the Christian
  the glory of God is His communication of Himself. Hence the so-called
  religious humility, which makes God different in nature from His
  work, really degrades the object of its worship. It puts mere power
  above the gifts of spirit, and it indicates that the worshipper has
  not been emancipated from the slavishness, which makes a fetish of
  its God. Such a religion is not free, and the development of man
  destroys it.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The intense love of the young mother drew the divine and the human
  together, and set at nought the contrast which prose ever draws
  between them. This thought of the unity of God and man is one which
  has frequent utterance from the poet when his religious spirit is
  most deeply moved; for it is the characteristic of religious feeling
  that it abolishes all sense of separation. It removes all the
  limitations of finitude and lifts man into rapturous unity with the
  God he adores; and it gives such <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg152" id="pg152">152</a></span> completeness to his life that it
  seems to him to be a joyous pulse of the life that is absolute. The
  feeling of unity may be an illusion. This we cannot discuss here;
  but, in any case, it is a feeling essential to religion. And the
  philosophy which seeks to lift this feeling into clear consciousness
  and to account for its existence, cannot but recognize that it
  implies and presupposes the essential affinity of the divine nature
  with the nature of man.</p>

  <p>Thus, both from the side of morality and from that of religion, we
  are brought to recognize the unity of God with man as a spiritual
  being. The moral ideal is man's idea of perfection, that is, his idea
  of God. While theology and philosophy are often occupied with the
  vain task of bridging a chasm between the finite and the infinite,
  which they assume to be separated, the supreme facts of the life of
  man as a spirit spring from their unity. In other words, morality and
  religion are but different manifestations of the same principle. The
  good that man effects is, at the same time, the working of God within
  him. The activity that man is,</p>

  <p>And while man's moral endeavour is thus recognized as the activity
  of God within him, it is also implied that the divine being can be
  known only as revealed, and incarnated, if one may so say, in a
  perfect human character. It was a permanent conviction of Browning,

  <p>So far from regarding the Power in the world which makes for
  righteousness, as "not-ourselves," as Matthew Arnold did in his
  haste, that Power is known to be the man's true self and more, and
  morality is the gradual process whereby its content is evolved. And

  the term Heaven, is, for Browning,</p>

  <p>It may be well before going further to gather together the results
  so far reached.</p>

  <p>Browning was aware of the conflict of the religious and moral
  consciousness, but he did not hesitate to give to each of them its
  most uncompromising utterance. And it is on this account that he is
  instructive; for, whatever may be the value of compromise in
  practical affairs, there is no doubt that it has never done anything
  to advance human thought. His religion is an optimistic faith, a
  peaceful consciousness of the presence of the highest in man, and
  therefore in all other things. Yet he does not hesitate to represent
  the moral life as a struggle with evil, and a movement through error
  towards a highest good which is never finally realized. He sees that
  the contradiction is not an absolute one, but that a good man is
  always <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg156" id=
  "pg156">156</a></span> both moral and religious, and, in every good
  act he does, transcends their difference. He knew that the ideal
  apart from the process is nothing, and that "a God beyond the stars"
  is simply the unknowable. But he knew, too, that the ideal is not
  <i>merely</i> the process, but also that which starts the process,
  guides it, and comes to itself through it. God, emptied of human
  elements, is a mere name; but, at the same time, the process of human
  evolution does not exhaust the idea of God. The process by itself,
  <i>i.e.</i>, mere morality, is a conception of a fragment, a fiction
  of abstract thought; it is a movement which has no beginning or end;
  and in it neither the head nor the heart of man could find
  contentment. He is driven by ethics into philosophy, and by morality
  into religion.</p>

  <p>It was in this way that Browning found himself compelled to trace
  back the moral process to its origin, and to identify the moral law
  with the nature of God. It is this that gives value to his view of
  moral progress, as reaching beyond death to a higher stage of being,
  for which man's attainments in this life are only preliminary.</p>

  </div>

  <p>There are other "adventures brave and new" for man, "more lives
  yet," other ways of warfare, other depths of goodness and heights of
  love. The poet lifts the moral ideal into infinitude, and removes
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg157" id="pg157">157</a></span> all
  limits to the possibility and necessity of being good. Nay, the
  process itself is good. Moral activity is its own bountiful reward;
  for moral progress, which means struggle, is the best thing in the
  world or out of it. To end such a process, to stop that activity,
  were therefore evil. But it cannot end, for it is the
  self-manifestation of the divine life. There is plenty of way to
  make, for the ideal is absolute goodness. The process cannot exhaust
  the absolute, and it is impossible that man should be God. And yet
  this process is the process of the absolute, the working of the
  ideal, the presence of the highest in man as a living power realizing
  itself in his acts and in his thoughts. And the absolute cannot fail;
  not in man, for the process is the evolution of his essential nature;
  and not in the world, for that is but the necessary instrument of the
  evolution. By lifting the moral ideal of man to infinitude, the poet
  has identified it with the nature of God, and made it the absolute
  law of things.</p>

  <p>Now, this idea of the identity of the human and the divine is a
  perfectly familiar Christian idea.</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>This idea is involved in the ordinary expressions of religious
  thought. But, nevertheless, both theology and philosophy shrink from
  giving to <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg158" id=
  "pg158">158</a></span> it a clear and unembarrassed utterance.
  Instead of rising to the sublime boldness of the Nazarene Teacher,
  they set up prudential differences between God and
  man&mdash;differences not of degree only but of nature; and, in
  consequence, God is reduced into an unknowable absolute, and man is
  made incapable not only of moral, but also of intellectual life. The
  poet himself has proved craven-hearted in this, as we shall see. He,
  too, sets up insurmountable barriers between the divine and the
  human, and thereby weakens both his religious and his moral
  convictions. His moral inspiration is greatest just where his
  religious enthusiasm is most intense. In <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra, The Death
  in the Desert</i>, and <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, there prevails a
  constant sense of the community of God and man within the realm of
  goodness; and the world itself, "with its dread machinery of sin and
  sorrow," is made to join the great conspiracy, whose purpose is at
  once the evolution of man's character, and the realization of the
  will of God.</p>

  <p>But, if we follow Browning's thoughts in his later and more
  reflective poems, such as <i>Ferishtah's</i> <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg159" id="pg159">159</a></span> <i>Fancies</i>
  for instance, it will not be possible to hold that the poet
  altogether realized the importance for both morality and religion
  alike, of the idea of the actual immanence of God in man. In these
  poems he seems to have abandoned it in favour of the hypotheses of a
  more timid philosophy. But, if his religious faith had not been
  embarrassed by certain dogmatic presuppositions of which he could not
  free himself, he might have met more successfully some of the
  difficulties which later reflection revealed to him, and might have
  been able to set a true value on that "philosophy," which betrayed
  his faith while appearing to support it.</p>

  <p>But, before trying to criticize the principle by means of which
  Browning sought to reconcile the moral and religious elements of
  human life, it may be well to give it a more explicit and careful
  statement.</p>

  <p>What, then, is that principle of unity between the divine and the
  human? How can we interpret the life of man as God's life in man, so
  that man, in attaining the moral ideal proper to his own nature, is
  at the same time fulfilling ends which may justly be called
  divine?</p>

  <p>The poet, in early life and in late life alike, has one answer to
  this question&mdash;an answer given with the confidence of complete
  conviction. The meeting-point of God and man is love. Love, in other
  words, is, for the poet, the supreme principle both of morality and
  religion. Love, once for all, solves that contradiction between them
  which, both in <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg160" id=
  "pg160">160</a></span> theory and in practice, has embarrassed the
  world for so many ages. Love is the sublimest conception attainable
  by man; a life inspired by it is the most perfect form of goodness he
  can conceive; therefore, love is, at the same moment, man's moral
  ideal, and the very essence of Godhood. A life actuated by love is
  divine, whatever other limitations it may have. Such is the
  perfection and glory of this emotion, when it has been translated
  into a self-conscious motive, and become the energy of an intelligent
  will, that it lifts him who owns it to the sublimest height of
  being.</p>

    <p>A: <i>Easter Day</i>.</p>

  <p>Taking Browning's work as a whole, it is scarcely possible to deny
  that this is at once the supreme motive of his art, and the principle
  on which his moral and religious doctrine rests. He is always strong
  and convincing when he is dealing with this theme. It was evidently
  his own deepest conviction, and it gave him the courage to face the
  evils of the world, and the power as an artist to "contrive his music
  from its moans." It plays, in his philosophy of life, the part that
  Reason fills for Hegel, or the Blind Will for Schopenhauer; and he is
  as fearless as they are in reducing all phenomena into forms of the
  activity of his first principle. Love not only gave him firm footing
  amid the wash and welter of the present world, where time spins fast,
  life fleets, and all is change, but it made him look forward with joy
  to "the immortal course"; for, to him, all the universe is
  love-woven. All life is but treading the "love-way," and no wanderer
  can finally lose it. "The way-faring men, though fools, shall not err
  therein."</p>

  <p>Since love has such an important place in Browning's theory of
  life, it is necessary to see what he means by it. For love has had
  for different <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg163" id=
  "pg163">163</a></span> individuals, ages and nations, a very
  different significance; and almost every great poet has given it a
  different interpretation. And this is not unnatural. For love is a
  passion which, beginning with youth and the hey-day of the blood,
  expands with the expanding life, and takes new forms of beauty and
  goodness at every stage. And this is equally true, whether we speak
  of the individual or of the human race.</p>

  <p>Love is no accident in man's history, nor a passing emotion. It is
  rather a constitutive element of man's nature, fundamental and
  necessary as his intelligence. And, like everything native and
  constitutive, it is obedient to the law of evolution, which is the
  law of man's being; and it passes, therefore, through ever varying
  forms. To it&mdash;if we may for the moment make a distinction
  between the theoretical and practical life, or between ideas and
  their causative potency&mdash;must be attributed the constructive
  power which has built the world of morality, with its intangible but
  most real relations which bind man to man and age to age. It is the
  author of the organic institutions which, standing between the
  individual and the rudeness of nature, awaken in him the need, and
  give him the desire and the faculty, of attaining higher things than
  physical satisfaction. Man is meant to act as well as to think, to be
  virtuous as well as to have knowledge. It is possible that reverence
  for the intellect may have led men, at times, to attribute the
  evolution of the race too exclusively to <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg164" id="pg164">164</a></span> the theoretic
  consciousness, forgetting that, along with reason, there co-operates
  a twin power in all that is wisest and best in us, and that a heart
  which can love, is as essential a pre-condition of all worthy
  attainment, as an intellect which can see. Love and reason <sup>A</sup> are
  equally primal powers in man, and they reflect might into each other:
  for love increases knowledge, and knowledge love. It is their
  combined power that gives interest and meaning to the facts of life,
  and transmutes them into a moral and intellectual order. They,
  together, are lifting man out of the isolation and chaos of
  subjectivity into membership in a spiritual kingdom, where collision
  and exclusion are impossible, and all are at once kings and
  subjects.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: It would be more correct to say the reason that is loving or
    the love that is rational; for, though there is distinction, there
    is no dualism.</p>
  </div>

  <p>And, just as reason is present as a transmuting power in the
  sensational life of the infancy of the individual and race, so is
  love present amidst the confused and chaotic activity of the life
  that knows no law other than its own changing emotions. Both make for
  order, and both grow with it. Both love and reason have travelled a
  long way in the history of man. The patriot's passion for his
  country, the enthusiasm of pity and helpfulness towards all suffering
  which marks the man of God, are as far removed from the physical
  attraction of sex for sex, and the mere liking of the eye and ear, as
  is the intellectual power of the sage from the vulpine <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg165" id="pg165">165</a></span> cunning of the
  savage. "For," as Emerson well said, "it is a fire that, kindling its
  first embers in the narrow nook of a private bosom, caught from a
  wandering spark out of another heart, glows and enlarges until it
  warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women, upon the universal
  heart of all, and so lights up the world and all nature with its
  generous flames." Both love and reason alike pass through stage after
  stage, always away from the particularity of selfishness and
  ignorance, into larger and larger cycles of common truth and
  goodness, towards the full realization of knowledge and benevolence,
  which is the inheritance of emancipated man. In this transition, the
  sensuous play of feeling within man, and the sensitive responses to
  external stimuli, are made more and more organic to ends which are
  universal, that is, to spiritual ends. Love, which in its earliest
  form, seems to be the natural yearning of brute for brute, appearing
  and disappearing at the suggestion of physical needs, passes into an
  idealized sentiment, into an emotion of the soul, into a principle of
  moral activity which manifests itself in a permanent outflow of
  helpful deeds for man. It represents, when thus sublimated, one side
  at least of the expansion of the self, which culminates when the
  world beats in the pulse of the individual, and the joys and sorrows,
  the defeats and victories of mankind are felt by him as his own. It
  is no longer dependent merely on the incitement of youth, grace,
  beauty, whether of body or character; it transcends all limitations
  of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg166" id="pg166">166</a></span>
  sex and age, and finds objects on which it can spend itself in all
  that God has made, even in that which has violated its own law of
  life and become mean and pitiful. It becomes a love of fallen
  humanity, and an ardour to save it by becoming the conscious and
  permanent motive of all men. The history of this evolution of love
  has been written by the poets. Every phase through which this
  ever-deepening emotion has passed, every form which this primary
  power has taken in its growth, has received from them its own proper
  expression. They have made even the grosser instincts lyric with
  beauty; and, ascending with their theme, they have sung the pure
  passion of soul for soul, its charm and its strength, its idealism
  and heroism, up to the point at which, in Browning, it transcends the
  limits of finite existence, sheds all its earthly vesture, and
  becomes a spiritual principle of religious aspiration and
  self-surrender to God.</p>

  <p>Browning nowhere shows his native strength more clearly than in
  his treatment of love. He has touched this world-old
  theme&mdash;which almost every poet has handled, and handled in his
  highest manner&mdash;with that freshness and insight, which is
  possible only to the inborn originality of genius. Other poets have,
  in some ways, given to love a more exquisite utterance, and rendered
  its sweetness, and tenderness, and charm with a lighter grace. It may
  even be admitted that there are poets whose verses have echoed more
  faithfully the fervour and intoxication of passion, and who have
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg167" id="pg167">167</a></span> shown
  greater power of interpreting it in the light of a mystic idealism.
  But, in one thing, Browning stands alone. He has given to love a
  moral significance, a place and power amongst those substantial
  elements on which rest the dignity of man's being and the greatness
  of his destiny, in a way which is, I believe, without example in any
  other poet. And he has done this by means of that moral and religious
  earnestness, which pervades all his poetry. The one object of supreme
  interest to him is the development of the soul, and his penetrative
  insight revealed to him the power to love as the paramount fact in
  that development. To love, he repeatedly tells us, is the sole and
  supreme object of man's life; it is the one lesson which he has to
  learn on earth; and, love once learnt, in what way matters little,
  "it leaves completion in the soul." Love we dare not, and, indeed,
  cannot absolutely miss. No man can be absolutely selfish and be
  man.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Beneath the veriest ash, there hides a spark of soul</p>

  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>B: <i>Ibid.</i> liv.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This view of the significance of love grew on Browning
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg168" id="pg168">168</a></span> as
  his knowledge of man's nature and destiny became fuller and deeper,
  while, at the same time, his trust in the intellect became less. Even
  in <i>Paracelsus</i> he reveals love, not as a sentiment or
  intoxicating passion, as one might expect from a youthful poet, but
  as one of the great fundamental "faculties" of man. Love, "blind,
  oft-failing, half-enlightened, often-chequered trust," though it be,
  still makes man</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"The heir of hopes too fair to turn out false."</p>
  </div>

  <p>In that poem, love is definitely lifted by the poet to the level
  of knowledge. Intellectual gain, apart from love, is folly and
  futility, worthless for the individual and worthless to the race.
  "Mind is nothing but disease," Paracelsus cries in the bitterness of
  his disappointment, "and natural health is ignorance"; and he asks of
  the mad poet who "loved too rashly,"</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Are we not halves of one dissevered world,</p>

  <p>And, at the end of the poem, Paracelsus, coming to an
  understanding with himself as to the gain and loss of life, proclaims
  with his last strength the truth he had missed throughout his great
  career, namely, the supreme worth of love.</p><span class=

  <p>As long as he hated men, or, in his passionate pursuit of truth,
  was indifferent to their concerns, it was not strange that he saw no
  good in men and failed to help them. Knowledge without love is not
  <i>true</i> knowledge, but folly and weakness.</p>

  <p>But, great as is the place given to love in <i>Paracelsus</i>, it
  is far less than that given to it in the poet's later works. In
  <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i> and <i>La Saisiaz</i> it is no longer
  rivalled by knowledge; nor even in <i>Easter Day</i>, where the voice
  beside the poet proclaiming that</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>gives a final pronouncement upon the purposes of the life of man.
  The world of sense&mdash;of beauty and art, of knowledge and truth,
  are given to man, but none of them satisfy his spirit; they merely
  sting with hunger for something better. "Deficiency gapes every

  <p>In his later reflective poems, in which he deals with the problems
  of life in the spirit of a metaphysician, seeking a definite answer
  to the questions of the intelligence, he declares the reason for his
  preference of love to knowledge. In <i>La Saisiaz</i> he states that
  man's love is God's too, a spark from His central fire; but man's
  knowledge is man's only. Knowledge is finite, limited and tinged with
  sense. The truth we reach at best is only truth <i>for us</i>,
  relative, distorted. We are for ever kept from the fact which is
  supposed to be given; our intellects play about it; sense and even
  intellect itself are interposing media, which we must use, and yet,
  in using them, we only fool ourselves with semblances. The poet has
  now grown so cautious that he will not declare his own knowledge to
  be valid for any other man. David Hume could scarcely be more
  suspicious of the human intellect; nor Berkeley more surely persuaded
  of the purely subjective nature of its attainments. In fact, the
  latter relied on human knowledge in a way impossible to Browning, for
  he regarded it as the language of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg171" id="pg171">171</a></span> spirit speaking to spirit. Out of
  his experience, Browning says,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i10">"There crowds conjecture manifold.</p>

    <p>But, as knowledge, this comes only,&mdash;things may be as I

  <p>This faculty of love, so far from being tainted with finitude,
  like knowledge; so far from being mere man's, or a temporary and
  deceptive power given to man for temporary uses, by a Creator who has
  another ineffably higher way of loving, as He has of truth, is itself
  divine. In contrast with the activity of love, Omnipotence itself
  dwindles into insignificance, and creation sinks into a puny exercise
  of power. Love, in a word, is the highest good; and, as such, it has
  all its worth in itself, and gives to all other things what worth
  they have. God Himself gains the "ineffable crown" by showing love
  and saving the weak. It is the power divine, the central energy of
  God's being.</p>

  <p>Browning never forgets this moral or religious quality of love. So
  pure is this emotion to the poet, "so perfect in whiteness, that it
  will not take pollution; but, ermine-like, is armed from dishonour by
  its own soft snow." In the corruptest hearts, amidst the worst
  sensuality, love is still a power divine, making for all goodness.
  Even when it is kindled into flame by an illicit touch, and wars
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg173" id="pg173">173</a></span>
  against the life of the family, which is its own product, its worth
  is supreme. He who has learned to love in any way, has "caught God's
  secret." How he has caught it, whom he loves, whether or not he is
  loved in return, all these things matter little. The paramount
  question on which hangs man's fate is, has he learned to love
  another, any other, Fifine or Elvire. "She has lost me," said the
  unloved lover; "I have gained her. Her soul's mine."</p>

  <p>The supreme worth of love, the mere emotion itself, however called
  into activity, secures it against all taint. No one who understands
  Browning in the least, can accuse him of touching with a rash hand
  the sanctity of the family; rather he places it on the basis of its
  own principle, and thereby makes for it the strongest defence. Such
  love as he speaks of, however irregular its manifestation or sensuous
  its setting, can never be confounded with lust&mdash;"hell's own blue
  tint." It is further removed from lust even than asceticism. It has
  not even a negative attitude towards the flesh; but finds the flesh
  to be "stuff for transmuting," and reduces it to the uses of the
  spirit. The love which is sung by Browning is more pure and free, and
  is set in a higher altitude than anything that can be reached by the
  way of negation. It is a consecration of the undivided self, so that
  "soul helps not flesh more, than flesh helps soul." It is not only a
  spiritual and divine emotion, but it also "shows a heart within
  blood-tinctured with a veined humanity."</p><span class=

  <p>True love is always an infinite giving, which holds nothing back.
  It is a spendthrift, magnificent in its recklessness, squandering the
  very essence of the self upon its object, and by doing so, in the end

  becomes re-impersonated in another; the distinction of Me and Thee is
  swept away, and there pulses in two individuals one warm life.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The throwing down of the limits that wall a man within himself,
  the mingling of his own deepest interests with those of others,
  always marks love; <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg175" id=
  "pg175">175</a></span> be it love of man for maid, parent for child,
  or patriot for his country. It opens an outlet into the pure air of
  the world of objects, and enables man to escape from the stuffed and
  poisonous atmosphere of his narrow self. It is a streaming outwards
  of the inmost treasures of the spirit, a consecration of its best
  activities to the welfare of others. And when this is known to be the
  native quality and quintessence of love, no one can regard it
  anywhere, or at any time, as out of place. "Prize-lawful or
  prize-lawless" it is ever a flower, even though it grow, like the
  love of the hero of <i>Turf and Towers</i>, in slime. Lust, fleshly
  desire, which has been too often miscalled love, is its worst
  perversion. Love spends itself for another, and seeks satisfaction
  only in another's good. But last uses up others for its own worst
  purposes, wastes its object, and turns the current of life back
  inwards, into the slush and filth of selfish pleasure. The
  distinction between love and its perversion, which is impossible in
  the naive life of an animal, ought to be clear enough to all, and
  probably is. Nor should the sexual impulse in human beings be
  confused with fleshly desire, and treated as if it were merely
  natural, "the mere lust of life" common to all living
  things,&mdash;"that strive," as Spinoza put it, "to persevere in
  existing." For there is no purely natural impulse in man; all that he
  is, is transfused with spirit, whether he will or no. He cannot act
  as a mere animal, because he cannot leave his rational nature behind
  him. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg176" id="pg176">176</a></span>
  He cannot desire as an innocent brute desires: his desire is always
  love or lust. We have as little right to say that the wisdom of the
  sage is <i>nothing but</i> the purblind savagery of a Terra del
  Fuegian, as we have to assert that love is <i>nothing but</i> a
  sexual impulse. That impulse rather, when its potency is set free,
  will show itself, at first confusedly, but with more and more
  clearness as it expands, to be the yearning of soul for soul. It puts
  us "in training for a love which knows not sex, nor person, nor
  partiality; but which seeks virtue and wisdom everywhere, to the end
  of increasing virtue and wisdom." The height to which this passion
  lifts man, is just what makes possible the fall into a sensuality and
  excess of brutishness, in comparison with which animal life is a
  paradise of innocence.</p>

  <p>If this is clearly recognized, many of the idle questions of
  casuistry that are sometimes raised regarding sexual love and
  marriage will cease to trouble. For these questions generally
  presuppose the lowest possible view of this passion. Browning shows
  us how to follow with serene security the pure light of the emotion
  of love, amidst all the confused lawlessness of lustful passion, and
  through all the intricacies of human character. Love, he thinks, is
  never illicit, never unwise, except when it is disloyal to itself; it
  never ruins, but always strives to enrich its object. Bacon quotes
  with approval a saying "That it is impossible to love, and to be
  wise." Browning <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg177" id=
  "pg177">177</a></span> asserts that it is impossible to love and
  <i>not</i> be wise. It is a power that, according to the Christian
  idea which the poet adopts, has infinite goodness for its source, and
  that, even in its meanest expression, is always feeling its way back
  to its origin, flowing again into the ocean whence it came.</p>

  <p>So sparklingly pure is this passion that it could exorcise the
  evil and turn old to new, even in the case of Léonce Miranda. At
  least Browning, in this poem, strives to show that, being true love,
  though the love of an unclean man for an unclean woman, it was a
  power at war with the sordid elements of that sordid life. Love has
  always the same potency, flame is always flame,</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>But, while love is always a power lifting a man upwards to the

  such as Pompilia and Caponsacchi. Like mercy and every other

  <p>It were almost an endless task to recount the ways in which
  Browning exhibits the moralizing power of love: how it is for him the
  quintessence of all goodness; the motive, and inspiring cause, of
  every act in the world that is completely right; and how, on that
  account, it is the actual working in the man of the ideal of all
  perfection. This doctrine of love is, in my opinion, the richest vein
  of pure ore in Browning's poetry.</p>

  <p>But it remains to follow briefly our poet's treatment of love in
  another direction&mdash;as a principle present, not only in God as
  creative and redeeming Power, and in man as the highest motive and
  energy of the moral life, but also in the outer world, in the
  "material" universe. In the view of the poet, the whole creation is
  nothing but love incarnate, a pulsation from the divine heart. Love
  is the source of all law and of all beauty. "Day unto day uttereth
  speech, and night unto night speaketh knowledge. There is no speech
  or language where their voice is not heard." And our poet speaks
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg179" id="pg179">179</a></span> as if
  he had caught the meaning of the language, and believes that all
  things speak of love&mdash;the love of God.</p>

  <p>"I think," says the heroine of the <i>Inn Album</i>,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Womanliness means only motherhood;</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Ivàn Ivànovitch</i>.</p>

  <p>This instinct of love, which binds brute-parent to
  brute-offspring, is a kind of spiritual law in the natural world: it,
  like all law, guarantees the continuity and unity of the world, and
  it is scarcely akin to merely physical attraction. No doubt its basis
  is physical; it has an organism of flesh and blood for its vehicle
  and instrument: but mathematical physics cannot explain it, nor can
  it be detected by chemical tests. Rather, with the poet, we are to
  regard brute affection as a kind of rude outline of human love; as a
  law in nature, which, when understood by man and adopted as his rule
  of conduct, becomes the essence and potency of his moral life.</p>

  <p>Thus Browning regards love as an omnipresent good. There is
  nothing, he tells us in <i>Fifine</i>, which cannot reflect it; even
  moral putridity becomes phosphorescent, "and sparks from heaven
  transpierce earth's coarsest covertures."</p>

  </div>

  <p>And how is this interpretation achieved? By penetrating behind
  force, power, mechanism, and even intelligence, thinks the poet, to a
  purpose which is benevolent, a reason which is all embracing and
  rooted in love. The magnificent failure of Paracelsus came from
  missing this last step. His transcendent hunger for knowledge was not
  satisfied, not because human knowledge is essentially an illusion or
  mind disease, but because his knowledge <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg183" id="pg183">183</a></span> did not reach the
  final truth of things, which is love. For love alone makes the heart
  wise, to know the secret of all being. This is the ultimate
  hypothesis in the light of which alone man can catch a glimpse of the
  general direction and intent of the universal movement in the world
  and man. Dying, Paracelsus, taught by Aprile, caught a glimpse of
  this elemental "love-force," in which alone lies the clue to every
  problem, and the promise of the final satisfaction of the human
  spirit. Failing in this knowledge, man may know many things, but
  nothing truly; for all such knowledge stays with outward shows. It is
  love alone that puts man in the right relation to his fellows and to
  the world, and removes the distortion which fills life with sorrow,
  and makes it</p>

  <p>We have now seen how Browning sought to explain all things as

  all the variety of finite existence, and even the deep discrepancies
  of good and evil, under the sway of one idea. I have already tried to
  show that all human thought is occupied with the same task: science,
  art, philosophy, and even the most ordinary common-sense, are all, in
  their different ways, seeking for constant laws amongst changing
  facts. Nay, we may even go so far as to say that all the activity of
  man, the practical as well as the theoretical, is an attempt to
  establish a <i>modus vivendi</i> between his environment and himself.
  And such an attempt rests on the assumption that there is some ground
  common to both of the struggling <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg186" id="pg186">186</a></span> powers within and without, some
  principle that manifests itself both in man and in nature. So that
  all men are philosophers to the extent of postulating a unity, which
  is deeper than all differences; and all are alike trying to discover,
  in however limited or ignorant a way, what that unity is. If this
  fact were more constantly kept in view, the effort of philosophers to
  bring the ultimate colligating principles of thought into clear
  consciousness would not, at the outset at least, be regarded with so
  much suspicion. For the philosopher differs from the practical man of
  the world, not so much in the nature of the task which he is trying
  to accomplish, as in the distinct and conscious purpose with which he
  enters upon it.</p>

  <p>Now, I think that those, who, like Browning, offer an explicitly
  optimistic idea of the relation between man and the world, have a
  special right to a respectful hearing; for it can scarcely be denied
  that their optimistic explanation is invaluable, <i>if it is
  true</i>&mdash;</p>

  <p>Despair is a great clog to good work for the world, and
  pessimists, as a rule, have shown much more readiness than optimists
  to let evil have its unimpeded way. Having found, like Schopenhauer,
  that "Life is an awkward business," they "determine to <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg187" id="pg187">187</a></span> spend life in
  reflecting on it," or at least in moaning about it. The world's
  helpers have been men of another mould; and the contrast between
  Fichte and Schopenhauer is suggestive of a general
  truth:&mdash;"Fichte, in the bright triumphant flight of his
  idealism, supported by faith in a moral order of the world which
  works for righteousness, turning his back on the darker ethics of
  self-torture and mortification, and rushing into the political and
  social fray, proclaiming the duties of patriotism, idealizing the
  soldier, calling to and exercising an active philanthrophy, living
  with his nation, and continually urging it upwards to higher levels
  of self-realization&mdash;Schopenhauer recurring to the idea of
  asceticism, preaching the blessedness of the quiescence of all will,
  disparaging efforts to save the nation or elevate the masses, and
  holding that each has enough to do in raising his own self from its
  dull engrossment in lower things to an absorption in that pure,
  passionless being which lies far beyond all, even the so-called
  highest, pursuits of practical life."<sup>A</sup></p>

  <p>A pessimism, which is nothing more than flippant fault-finding,
  frequently gains a cheap reputation for wisdom; and, on the other
  hand, an optimism, which is really the result of much reflection and
  experience, may be regarded as the product of a superficial spirit
  that has never known the deeper evils of life. But, if pessimism be
  true, it differs from other truths by its uselessness; for, even if
  it <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg188" id="pg188">188</a></span>
  saves man from the bitterness of petty disappointments, it does so
  only by making the misery universal. There is no need to specify,
  when "<i>All</i> is vanity." The drowning man does not feel the
  discomfort of being wet. But yet, if we reflect on the problem of
  evil, we shall find that there is no neutral ground, and shall
  ultimately be driven to choose between pessimism and its opposite.
  Nor, on the other hand, is the suppression of the problem of evil
  possible, except at a great cost. It presents itself anew in the mind
  of every thinking man; and some kind of solution of it, or at least
  some definite way of meeting its difficulty, is involved in the
  attitude which every man assumes towards life and its tasks.</p>

  <p>It is not impossible that there may be as much to be said for
  Browning's joy in life and his love of it, as there is for his
  predecessor's rage and sorrow. Browning certainly thought that there
  was; and he held his view consistently to the end. We cannot,
  therefore, do justice to the poet without dealing critically with the
  principle on which he has based his faith, and observing how far it
  is applicable to the facts of human life. As I have previously said,
  he strives hard to come into fair contact with the misery of man in
  all its sadness; and, after doing so, he claims, not as a matter of
  poetic sentiment, but as a matter of strict truth, that good is the
  heart and reality of it all. It is true that he cannot demonstrate
  the truth of his principle by reference to all the facts, any more
  than the scientific man can <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg189" id=
  "pg189">189</a></span> justify his hypothesis in every detail; but he
  holds it as a faith which reason can justify and experience
  establish, although not in every isolated phenomenon. The good may,
  he holds, be seen actually at work in the world, and its process will
  be more fully known, as human life advances towards its goal.</p>

  <p>"Since we know love we know enough"; for in love, he confidently

  <p>Now, what is to be made of an optimism of this kind, which is
  based upon love and which professes to start from experience, or to
  be legitimately and rationally derived from it?</p>

  <p>If such a view be taken seriously, as I propose doing, we must be
  prepared to meet at the outset with some very grave difficulties. The
  first of these is that it is an interpretation of facts by a human
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg190" id="pg190">190</a></span>
  emotion. To say that love blushes in the rose, or breaks into beauty
  in the clouds, that it shows its strength in the storm, and sets the
  stars in the sky, and that it is in all things the source of order
  and law, may imply a principle of supreme worth both to poetry and
  religion; but when we are asked to take it as a metaphysical
  explanation of facts, we are prone, like the judges of Caponsacchi,
  not to "levity, or to anything indecorous"&mdash;</p>

  <p>We are sufficiently willing to let the doctrine be held as a pious
  opinion. The faith that "all's love yet all's law," like many another
  illusion, if not hugged too closely, may comfort man's nakedness. But
  if we are asked to substitute this view for that which the sciences
  suggest,&mdash;if we are asked to put "Love" in the place of physical
  energy, and, by assuming it as a principle, to regard as unreal all
  the infinite misery of humanity and the degradation of intellect and
  character from which it arises, common-sense seems at once to take
  the side of the doleful sage of Chelsea. When the optimist postulates
  that the state of the world, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg191"
  id="pg191">191</a></span> were it rightly understood, is completely
  satisfactory, reason seems to be brought to a stand; and if poetry
  and religion involve such a postulate, they are taken to be
  ministering to the emotions at the expense of the intellect.</p>

  <p>Browning, however, was not a mere sentimentalist who could satisfy
  his heart without answering the questions of his intellect. Nor is
  his view without support&mdash;at least, as regards the substance of
  it. The presence of an idealistic element in things is recognized
  even by ordinary thought; and no man's world is so poor that it would
  not be poorer still for him, if it were reduced by the abstract
  sciences of nature into a mere manifestation of physical force. Such
  a world Richter compares to an empty eye-socket.</p>

  <p>The great result of speculation since the time of Kant is to teach
  us to recognize that objects are essentially related to mind, and
  that the principles which rule our thought enter, so to speak, into
  the constitution of the things we know. A very slight acquaintance
  with the history even of psychology, especially in modern times,
  shows that facts are more and more retracted into thought. This
  science, which began with a sufficiently common-sense view, not only
  of the reality and solidity of the things of the outer world, but of
  their opposition to, or independence of thought, is now thinning that
  world down into a mere shadow&mdash;a something which excites
  sensation. It shows that external things as we know them, and we are
  not concerned in any others, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg192"
  id="pg192">192</a></span> are, to a very great extent, the product of
  our thinking activities. No one will now subscribe to the Lockian or
  Humean view, of images impressed by objects on mind: the object which
  "impresses" has first to be made by mind, out of the results of
  nervous excitation. In a word, modern psychology as well as modern
  metaphysics, is demonstrating more and more fully the dependence of
  the world, as it is known, on the nature and activity of man's mind.
  Every explanation of the world is found to be, in this sense,
  idealistic; and in this respect, there is no difference whatsoever
  between the interpretation given by science and that of poetry, or
  religion, or philosophy. If we say that a thing is a "substance," or
  has "a cause"; if, with the physicist, we assert the principle of the
  transmutation of energy, or make use of the idea of evolution with
  the biologist or geologist; nay, if we speak of time and space with
  the mathematician, we use principles of unity derived from
  self-consciousness, and interpret nature in terms of ourselves, just
  as truly as the poet or philosopher, who makes love, or reason, the
  constitutive element in things. If the practical man of the world
  charges the poet and philosopher with living amidst phantoms, he can
  be answered with a "<i>Tu quoque</i>." "How easy," said Emerson, "it
  is to show the materialist that he also is a phantom walking and
  working amid phantoms, and that he need only ask a question or two
  beyond his daily questions to find his solid universe proving dim and
  impalpable before his sense." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg193"
  id="pg193">193</a></span> "Sense," which seems to show directly that
  the world is a solid reality, not dependent in any way on thought, is
  found not to be reliable. All science is nothing but an appeal to
  thought from ordinary sensuous opinion. It is an attempt to find the
  reality of things by thinking about them; and this reality, when it
  is found, turns out to be a law. But laws are ideas; though, if they
  are true ideas, they represent not merely thoughts in the mind, but
  also real principles, which manifest themselves in the objects of the
  outer world, as well as in the thinker's mind.</p>

  <p>It is not possible in such a work as this, to give a carefully
  reasoned proof of this view of the relation of thought and things, or
  to repeat the argument of Kant. I must be content with merely
  referring to it, as showing that the principles in virtue of which we
  think, are the principles in virtue of which objects as we know them
  exist; and we cannot be concerned with any other objects. The laws
  which scientific investigation discovers are not only ideas that can
  be written in books, but also principles which explain the nature of
  things. In other words, the hypotheses of the natural sciences, or
  their categories, are points of view in the light of which the
  external world can be regarded as governed by uniform laws. And these
  constructive principles, which lift the otherwise disconnected world
  into an intelligible system, are revelations of the nature of
  intelligence, and only on that account principles for explaining the
  world.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg194" id=

  <p>In this sense, it may be said that all knowledge is
  anthropomorphic; and in this respect there is no difference between
  the physics, which speaks of energy as the essence of things, and the
  poetry, which speaks of love as the ultimate principle of reality.
  Between such scientific and idealistic explanations there is not even
  the difference that the one begins without and the other within, or
  that the one is objective and the other subjective. The true
  distinction is that the principles upon which the latter proceed are
  less abstract than those of science. "Reason" and "love" are higher
  principles for the explanation of the nature of things than
  "substance" or "cause"; but both are forms of the unity of thought.
  And if the latter seem to have nothing to do with the self, it is
  only because they are inadequate to express its full character. On
  the other hand, the higher categories, or ideas of reason, seem to be
  merely anthropomorphic, and, therefore, ill-suited to explain nature,
  because the relation of nature to intelligence is habitually
  neglected by ordinary thought, which has not pressed its problems far
  enough to know that such higher categories can alone satisfy the
  demand for truth.</p>

  <p>But natural science is gradually driven from the lower to the
  higher categories, or, in other <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg195"
  id="pg195">195</a></span> words, it is learning to take a more and
  more idealistic view of nature. It is moving very slowly, because it
  is a long labour to exhaust the uses of an instrument of thought; and
  it is only at great intervals in the history of the human intellect,
  that we find the need of a change of categories. But, as already
  hinted, there is no doubt that science is becoming increasingly aware
  of the conditions, under which alone its results may be held as
  valid. At first, it drove "mind" out of the realm of nature, and
  offered to explain both it and man in physical and mathematical
  terms. But, in our day, the man of science has become too cautious to
  make such rash extensions of the principles he uses. He is more
  inclined to limit himself to his special field, and he refuses to
  make any declaration as to the ultimate nature of things. He holds
  himself apart from materialism, as he does from idealism. I think I
  may even go further, and say that the fatal flaw of materialism has
  been finally detected, and that the essential relativity of all
  objects to thought is all but universally acknowledged.</p>

  <p>The common notion that science gives a complete view of truth, to
  which we may appeal as refuting idealism, is untenable. Science
  itself will not support the appeal, but will direct the appellant to
  another court. Perhaps, rather, it would be truer to say that its
  attitude is one of doubt whether or not any court, philosophical or
  other, can give any valid decision on the matter. Confining
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg196" id="pg196">196</a></span>
  themselves to the region of material phenomena, scientific men
  generally leave to common ignorance, or to moral and theological
  tradition, all the interests and activities of man, other than those
  which are physical or physiological. And some of them are even aware,
  that if they could find the physical equation of man, or, through
  their knowledge of physiology, actually produce in man the
  sensations, thoughts, and notions now ascribed to the intelligent
  life within him, the question of the spiritual or material nature of
  man and the world, would remain precisely where it was. The
  explanation would still begin with mind and end there. The principles
  of the materialistic explanation of the world would still be derived
  from intelligence; mind would still underlie all it explained, and
  completed science would still be, in this sense, anthropomorphic. The
  charge of anthropomorphism thus falls to the ground, because it would
  prove too much. It is a weapon which cuts the hand that wields it.
  And, as directed against idealism, it only shows that he who uses it
  has inadequate notions both of the nature of the self and of the
  world, and is not aware that each gets meaning, only as an exponent
  of the other.</p>

  <p>On the whole, we may say that it is not men of science who now
  assail philosophy, because it gives an idealistic explanation of the
  world, so much as unsystematic dabblers in matters of thought. The
  best men of science, rather, show a tendency to acquiesce in a kind
  of dualism of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg197" id=
  "pg197">197</a></span> matter and spirit, and to leave morality and
  religion, art and philosophy to pursue their own ends undisturbed.
  Mr. Huxley, for instance, and some others, offer two philosophical
  solutions, one proceeding from the material world and the other from
  the sensations and other "facts of consciousness." They say that we
  may either explain man as a natural phenomenon, or the world as a
  mental one.</p>

  <p>But it is a little difficult not to ask which of these
  explanations is true. Both of them cannot well be, seeing that they
  are different. And neither of them can be adopted without very
  serious consequences. It would require considerable hardihood to
  suggest that natural science should be swept away in favour of
  psychology, which would be done if the one view held by Mr. Huxley
  were true. And, in my opinion, it requires quite as much hardihood to
  suggest the adoption of a theory that makes morality and religion
  illusory, which would be done were the other view valid.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, however, such an attitude can scarcely be
  held by any one who is interested <i>both</i> in the success of
  natural science and in the spiritual development of mankind. We are
  constrained rather to say that, if these rival lines of thought lead
  us to deny either the outer world of things, or the world of thought
  and morality, then they must both be wrong. They are not
  "explanations" but false theories, if they lead to such conclusions
  as these. And, instead of holding them up <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg198" id="pg198">198</a></span> to the world as
  the final triumph of human thought, we should sweep them into the
  dust-bin, and seek for some better explanation from a new point of
  view.</p>

  <p>And, indeed, a better explanation is sought, and sought not only
  by idealists, but by scientific men themselves,&mdash;did they only
  comprehend their own main tendency and method. The impulse towards
  unity, which is the very essence of thought, if it is baulked in one
  direction by a hopeless dualism, just breaks out in another.
  Subjective idealism, that is, the theory that things are nothing but
  phenomena of the individual's consciousness, that the world is really
  all inside the philosopher, is now known by most people to end in
  self-contradiction; and materialism is also known to begin with it.
  And there are not many people sanguine enough to believe with Mr.
  Huxley and Mr. Herbert Spencer, that, if we add two
  self-contradictory theories together, or hold them alternately, we
  shall find the truth. Modern science, that is, the science which does
  not philosophize, and modern philosophy are with tolerable unanimity
  denying this absolute dualism. They do not know of any thought that
  is not of things, or of any things that are not for thought. It is
  necessarily assumed that, in some way or other, the gap between
  things and thought is got over by knowledge. How the connection is
  brought about may not be known; but, that there is the connection
  between real things and true thoughts, no one can well deny. It is an
  ill-starred perversity which <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg199"
  id="pg199">199</a></span> leads men to deny such a connection, merely
  because they have not found out how it is established.</p>

  <p>A new category of thought has taken possession of the thought of
  our time&mdash;a category which is fatal to dualism. The idea of
  development is breaking down the division between mind and matter, as
  it is breaking down all other absolute divisions. Geology, astronomy,
  and physics at one extreme, biology, psychology, and philosophy at
  the other, combine in asserting the idea of the universe as a unity
  which is always evolving its content, and bringing its secret
  potencies to the light. It is true that these sciences have not
  linked hands as yet. We cannot get from chemistry to biology without
  a leap, or from physiology to psychology without another. But no one
  will postulate a rift right through being. The whole tendency of
  modern science implies the opposite of such a conception. History is
  striving to trace continuity between the civilized man and the
  savage. Psychology is making towards a junction with physiology and
  general biology, biology with chemistry, and chemistry with physics.
  That there is an unbroken continuity in existence is becoming a
  postulate of modern science, almost as truly as the "universality of
  law" or "the uniformity of nature." Nor is the postulate held less
  firmly because the evidence for the continuity of nature is not yet
  complete. Chemistry has not yet quite lapsed into physics; biology at
  present shows no sign of giving up its characteristic conception of
  life, and the former science is as yet quite unable to deal with that
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg200" id="pg200">200</a></span>
  peculiar phenomenon. The facts of consciousness have not been
  resolved into nervous action, and, so far, mind has not been shown to
  be a secretion of brain. Nevertheless, all these sciences are beating
  against the limits which separate them, and new suggestions of
  connection between natural life and its inorganic environment are
  continually discovered. The sciences are boring towards each other,
  and the dividing strata are wearing thin; so that it seems reasonable
  to expect that, with the growth of knowledge, an unbroken way upwards
  may be discovered, from the lowest and simplest stages of existence
  to the highest and most complex forms of self-conscious life.</p>

  <p>Now, to those persons who are primarily interested in the ethical
  and religious phenomena of man's life, the idea of abolishing the
  chasm between spirit and nature is viewed with no little
  apprehension. It is supposed that if evolution were established as a
  universal law, and the unity of being were proved, the mental and
  moral life of man would be degraded into a complex manifestation of
  mere physical force. And we even find religious men rejoicing at the
  failure of science to bridge the gap between the inorganic and the
  organic, and between natural and self-conscious life; as if the
  validity of religion depended upon the maintenance of their
  separating boundaries. But no religion that is free from
  superstitious elements has anything to gain from the failure of
  knowledge to relate things to each other. It is difficult to see how
  breaks in the continuity of being <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg201" id="pg201">201</a></span> can be established, when every
  living plant confutes the absolute difference between the organic and
  inorganic, and, by the very fact of living, turns the latter into the
  former; and it is difficult to deny the continuity of "mind and
  matter," when every human being is relating himself to the outer
  world in all his thoughts and actions. And religion is the very last
  form of thought which could profit from such a proof of absolute
  distinctions, were it possible. In fact, as we have seen, religion,
  in so far as it demands a perfect and absolute being as the object of
  worship, is vitally concerned in maintaining the unity of the world.
  It must assume that matter, in its degree, reveals the same principle
  which, in a higher form, manifests itself in spirit.</p>

  <p>But closer investigation will show that the real ground for such
  apprehension does not lie in the continuity of existence, which
  evolution implies; for religion itself postulates the same thing. The
  apprehension springs, rather, from the idea that the continuity
  asserted by evolution, is obtained by resolving the higher forms of
  existence into the lower. It is believed that, if the application of
  development to facts were successfully carried out, the organic would
  be shown to be nothing but complex inorganic forces, mental life
  nothing but a physiological process, and religion, morality, and art,
  nothing but products of the highly complex motion of highly complex
  aggregates of physical atoms.</p>

  <p>It seems to me quite natural that science should be regarded as
  tending towards such a materialistic <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg202" id="pg202">202</a></span> conclusion. This is the view which
  many scientific investigators have themselves taken of their work;
  and some of their philosophical exponents, notably Mr. Herbert
  Spencer, have, with more or less inconsistency, interpreted the idea
  of evolution in this manner. But, it may be well to bear in mind that
  science is generally far more successful in employing its
  constructive ideas, than it is in rendering an account of them. In
  fact, it is not its business to examine its categories: that task
  properly belongs to philosophy, and it is not a superfluous one. But,
  so long as the employment of the categories in the special province
  of a particular science yields valid results, scientific explorers
  and those who attach, and rightly attach, so much value to their
  discoveries, are very unwilling to believe that these categories are
  not valid universally. The warning voice of philosophy is not heeded,
  when it charges natural science with applying its conceptions to
  materials to which they are inadequate; and its examination of the
  categories of thought is regarded as an innocent, but also a useless,
  activity. For, it is argued, what good can arise from the analysis of
  our working ideas? The world looked for causes, and found them, when
  it was very young; but, up to the time of David Hume, no one had
  shown what causality meant, and the explanation which he offered is
  now rejected by modern science, as definitely as it is rejected by
  philosophy. Meantime, while philosophy is still engaged in exposing
  the fallacies of the theory of association as held by <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg203" id="pg203">203</a></span> Hume, science has
  gone beyond this category altogether; it is now establishing a theory
  of the conservation of energy, which supplants the law of causality
  by tracing it into a deeper law of nature.</p>

  <p>There is some force in this argument, but it cuts both ways. For,
  even if it be admitted that the category was successfully applied in
  the past, it is also admitted that it was applied without being
  understood; and it cannot now be questioned that the philosophers
  were right in rejecting it as the final explanation of the relation
  of objects to each other, and in pointing to other and higher
  connecting ideas. And this consideration should go some way towards
  convincing evolutionists that, though they may be able successfully
  to apply the idea of development to particular facts, this does not
  guarantee the soundness of their view of it as an instrument of
  thought, or of the nature of the final results which it is destined
  to achieve. Hence, without any disparagement to the new extension
  which science has received by the use of this new idea, it may be
  maintained that the ordinary view of its tendency and mission is
  erroneous.</p>

  <p>"The prevailing method of explaining the world," says Professor
  Caird, "may be described as an attempt to level 'downwards.' The
  doctrine of development, interpreted as that idea usually is
  interpreted, supports this view, as making it necessary to trace back
  higher and more complex to lower or simpler forms of being; for the
  most obvious way of accomplishing this task is to show analytically
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg204" id="pg204">204</a></span> that
  there is really nothing more in the former than in the latter."<sup>A</sup>
  "Divorced from matter," asks Professor Tyndall, "where is life to be
  found? Whatever our <i>faith</i> may say our <i>knowledge</i> shows
  them to be indissolubly joined. Every meal we eat, and every cup we
  drink, illustrates the mysterious <i>control of Mind by Matter</i>.
  Trace the line of life backwards and see it approaching more and more
  to what we call the <i>purely physical condition</i>."<sup>B</sup> And then,
  rising to the height of his subject, or even above it, he proclaims,
  "By an intellectual necessity I cross the boundary of the
  experimental evidence, and discern in that Matter which we, in our
  ignorance of its latent powers, and notwithstanding our professed
  reverence for its Creator, have hitherto covered with opprobrium, the
  promise and potency of all terrestrial life."<sup>C</sup> A little further on,
  speaking in the name of science, and on behalf of his scientific
  fellow-workers (with what right is a little doubtful), he
  adds&mdash;"We claim, and we shall wrest, from theology, the entire
  domain of cosmological theory. All schemes and systems which thus
  infringe upon the domain of science, must, <i>in so far as they do
  this,</i> submit to its control, and relinquish all thought of
  controlling it." But if science is to control the knowable world, he
  generously leaves the remainder for religion. He will not deprive it
  of a faith in "a Power absolutely inscrutable to the intellect
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg205" id="pg205">205</a></span> of
  man. As little in our days as in the days of Job can a man by
  searching find this Power out." And, now that he has left this empty
  sphere of the unknown to religion, he feels justified in adding,
  "There is, you will observe, no very rank materialism here."</p>

  <p>Some writers on ethics and religion have adopted the same view of
  the goal of the idea of evolution. In consistency with this supposed
  tendency of science, to resolve all things into their simplest, and
  earliest forms, religion has been traced back to the superstition and
  ghost-worship of savages; and then it has been contended that it is,
  in essence, nothing more than superstition and ghost-worship. And, in
  like manner, morality, with its categorical imperative of duty, has
  been traced back, without a break, to the ignorant fear of the
  vengeance of a savage chief. A similar process in the same direction
  reduces the love divine, of which our poet speaks, into brute lust;
  somewhat sublimated, it is true, in its highest forms, but not
  fundamentally changed.</p>

  <p>And when the sacred things of life are treated in this
  manner&mdash;when moral conduct is showed to <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg207" id="pg207">207</a></span> be evolved by a
  continuous process from "conduct in general," the conduct of an
  "infusorium or a cephalopod," or even of wind-mills or water-wheels,
  it is not surprising if the authority of the moral law seems to be
  undermined, and that "devout souls" are apprehensive of the results
  of science. "Does law so analyzed coerce you much?" asks
  Browning.</p>

  <p>The derivation of spiritual from natural laws thus appears to be
  fatal to the former; and religious teachers naturally think that it
  is necessary for their cause to snap the links of the chain of
  evolution, and, like Professor Drummond, to establish absolute gaps,
  not only between the inorganic and the organic worlds, but also
  between the self-conscious life of man and the mysterious, spiritual
  life of Christ, or God. But it seems to me that, in their antagonism
  to evolution, religious teachers are showing the same incapacity to
  distinguish between their friends and their foes, which they
  previously manifested in their acceptance of the Kantian doctrine of
  "things in themselves," &mdash;a doctrine which placed God and the
  soul beyond the power of speculative reason either to prove or
  disprove. It is, however, already recognized that the attempt of
  Mansel and Hamilton to degrade human reason for the behoof of faith
  was really a veiled agnosticism; and a little reflection must show
  that the idea of evolution, truly interpreted, in no wise threatens
  the degradation of man, or the overthrow of his spiritual interests.
  On the contrary, this idea is, in all the history of <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg208" id="pg208">208</a></span> thought, the
  first constructive hypothesis which is adequate to the uses of ethics
  and religion. By means of it, we may hope to solve many of the
  problems arising from the nature of knowledge and moral conduct,
  which the lower category of cause turned into pure enigmas. It seems,
  indeed, to contain the promise of establishing the science of man, as
  intelligent, on a firm basis; on which we may raise a superstructure,
  comparable in strength and superior in worth, to that of the science
  of nature. And, even if the moral science must, like philosophy,
  always return to the beginning&mdash;must, that is, from the
  necessity of its nature, and not from any complete failure&mdash;it
  will still begin again at a higher level now that the idea of
  evolution is in the field.</p>

  <p>It now remains to show in what way the idea of evolution leaves
  room for religion and morality; or, in other words, to show how, so
  far from degrading man to the level of the brute condition, and
  running life down into "purely physical conditions," it contains the
  promise of establishing that idealistic view of the world, which is
  maintained by art and religion.</p>

  <p>In order to show this, it is necessary that the idea of evolution
  should be used fearlessly, and applied to all facts that can in any
  way come under it. It must, in other words, be used as a category of
  thought, whose application is universal; so that, if it is valid at
  all as a theory, it is valid of all finite things. For the question
  we are dealing with <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg209" id=
  "pg209">209</a></span> is not the truth of the hypothesis of a
  particular science, but the truth of a hypothesis as to the relation
  of all objects in the world, including man himself. We must not be
  deterred from this universal application by the fact that we cannot,
  as yet, prove its truth in every detail. No scientific hypothesis
  ever has exhausted its details. I consider, therefore, that Mr.
  Tyndall had a complete right to "cross the boundary of the
  experimental evidence by an intellectual necessity"; for the
  necessity comes from the assumption of a possible explanation by the
  aid of the hypothesis. It is no argument against such a procedure to
  insist that, as yet, there is no proof of the absolute continuity of
  matter and physical life, or that the dead begets the living. The
  hypothesis is not disproved by the absence of evidence; it is only
  not proved. The connection may be there, although we have not, as
  yet, been able to find it. In the face of such difficulties as these,
  the scientific investigator has always a right to claim more time;
  and his attitude is impregnable as long as he remembers, as Mr.
  Tyndall did on the whole, that his hypothesis is a hypothesis.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Tyndall has himself given up this right. He, like Mr.
  Huxley, has placed the phenomena of self-consciousness outside of the
  developing process, and confined the sphere in which evolution is
  applicable, to natural objects. Between objects and the subject, even
  when both subject and object are man himself, there lies "an
  impassable gulf." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg210" id=
  "pg210">210</a></span> Even to try "to comprehend the connection
  between thought and thing is absurd, like the effort of a man trying
  to lift himself by his own waist-band." Our states of
  self-consciousness are symbols only&mdash;symbols of an outside
  entity, whose real nature we can never know. We know only these
  states; we only <i>infer</i> "that anything answering to our
  impressions exists outside of ourselves." And it is impossible to
  justify even that inference; for, if we can only know states of
  consciousness, we cannot say that they are symbols of anything, or
  that there is anything to be symbolized. The external world, on this
  theory, ceases to exist even as an unknown entity. In triumphantly
  pointing out that, in virtue of this psychological view, "There is,
  you will observe, no very rank materialism here," Mr. Tyndall forgets
  that he has destroyed the basis of all natural science, and reduced
  evolution into a law of "an outside entity," of which we can never
  know anything, and any inference regarding which violates every law
  of thought.</p>

  <p>It seems to me quite plain that either this psychological theory,
  which Mr. Tyndall has mistaken for a philosophy, is invalid; or else
  it is useless to endeavour to propound any view regarding a "nature
  which is the phantom of the individual's mind." I prefer the science
  of Mr. Tyndall (and of Mr. Huxley, too) to his philosophy; and he
  would have escaped materialism more effectively, if he had remained
  faithful to his theory of evolution. It is a disloyalty, not only to
  science, but to thought, to cast away <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg211" id="pg211">211</a></span> our categories when they seem to
  imply inconvenient consequences. They must be valid universally, if
  they are valid at all.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tyndall contends that nature makes man, and he finds evidence
  in the fact that we eat and drink, "of the control of mind by
  matter." Now, it seems to me, that <i>if</i> nature makes man, then
  nature makes man's thoughts also. His sensations, feelings, ideas,
  notions, being those of a naturally-evolved agent, are revelations of
  the potency of the primal matter, just as truly as are the buds,
  flowers, and fruits of a tree. No doubt, we cannot as yet "comprehend
  the connection" between nervous action and sensation, any more than
  we can comprehend the connection between inorganic and organic
  existence. But, if the absence of "experimental evidence" does not
  disprove the hypothesis in the one case, it can not disprove it in
  the other. There are two crucial points in which the theory has not
  been established.</p>

  <p>But, in both cases alike, there is the same kind of evidence that
  the connection exists; although in neither case can we, as yet,
  discover what it is. Plants live by changing inorganic elements into
  organic structure; and man is intelligent only in so far as he
  crosses over the boundary between subject and object, and knows the
  world without him. There is no "impassable gulf separating the
  subject and object"; if there were we could not know anything of
  either. There are not two worlds&mdash;the one of thoughts, the other
  of things&mdash;which <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg212" id=
  "pg212">212</a></span> are absolutely exclusive of each other, but
  one universe in which thought and reality meet. Mr. Tyndall thinks
  that it is an inference (and an inference over an impassable gulf!)
  that anything answering to our impressions exists outside ourselves.
  "The question of the external world is the great battleground of
  metaphysics," he quotes approvingly from Mr. J.S. Mill. But the
  question of the external world is not whether that world exists; it
  is, how are we to account for our knowledge that it does exist. The
  inference is not from thoughts to things, nor from things to
  thoughts, but from a partially known world to a systematic theory of
  that world. Philosophy is not engaged on the foolish enterprise of
  trying to discover whether the world exists, or whether we know that
  it exists; its problem is how to account for our knowledge. It asks
  what must the nature of things be, seeing that they are known; and
  what is the nature of thought, seeing that it knows facts?</p>

  <p>There is no hope whatsoever for ethics, or religion, or
  philosophy&mdash;no hope even for science&mdash;in a theory which
  would apply evolution all the way up from inorganic matter to life,
  but which would postulate an absolute break at consciousness. The
  connection between thought and things is there to begin with, whether
  we can account for it or not; if it were not, then natural science
  would be impossible. It would be palpably irrational even to try to
  find out the nature of things by thinking. The only science
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg213" id="pg213">213</a></span> would
  be psychology, and even that would be the science of "symbols of an
  unknown entity." What symbols of an unknown can signify, or how an
  unknown can produce symbols of itself across an impassable
  gulf&mdash;Mr. Spencer, Mr. Huxley, and Mr. Tyndall have yet to
  inform us.</p>

  <p>It is the more necessary to insist on this, because the division
  between thought and matter, which is admitted by these writers, is
  often grasped at by their opponents, as a means of warding off the
  results which they draw from the theory of evolution. When science
  breaks its sword, religion assails it, with the fragment. It is not
  at once evident that if this chasm were shown to exist, knowledge
  would be a chimera; for there would be no outer world at all, not
  even a phenomenal one, to supply an object for it. We <i>must</i>
  postulate the ultimate unity of all beings with each other and with
  the mind that knows them, just because we are intellectual and moral
  beings; and to destroy this unity is to "kill reason itself, as it
  were, in the eye," as Milton said.</p>

  <p>Now, evolution not only postulates unity, or the unbroken
  continuity of all existence, but it also negates all differences,
  except those which are expressions of that unity. It is not the mere
  assertion of a substratum under qualities; but it implies that the
  substratum penetrates into the qualities, and manifests itself in
  them. That which develops&mdash;be it plant, child, or biological
  kingdom&mdash;is, at every stage from lowest to highest, a concrete
  unity <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg214" id="pg214">214</a></span>
  of all its differences; and in the whole history of its process its
  actual content is always the same. The environment of the plant
  evokes that content, but it adds nothing to it. No addition of
  anything absolutely new, no external aggregation, no insertion of
  anything alien into a growing thing, is possible. What it is now, it
  was in the beginning; and what it will be, it is now. Granting the
  hypothesis of evolution, there can be no quarrel with the view that
  the crude beginnings of things, matter in its most nebulous state,
  contains potentially all the rich variety of both natural and
  spiritual life.</p>

  <p>But this continuity of all existence may be interpreted in two
  very different ways. It may lead us either to radically change our
  notions of mind and its activities, or "to radically change our
  notions of matter." We may take as the principle of explanation,
  either the beginning, or the end of the process of development. We
  may say of the simple and crass, "There is all that your rich
  universe really means"; or we may say of the spiritual activities of
  man, "This is what your crude beginning really was." We may explain
  the complex by the simple, or the simple by the complex. We may
  analyze the highest back into the lowest, or we may follow the
  lowest, by a process of synthesis, up to the highest.</p>

  <p>And one of the most important of all questions for morality and
  religion is the question, which of these two methods is valid. If out
  of crass matter <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg215" id=
  "pg215">215</a></span> is evolved all animal and spiritual life, does
  that prove life to be nothing but matter; or does it not rather show
  that what we, in our ignorance, took to be mere matter was really
  something much greater? If "crass matter" contains all this promise
  and potency, by what right do we still call it "crass"? It is
  manifestly impossible to treat the potencies, assumed to lie in a
  thing that grows, as if they were of no significance; first, to
  assert that such potencies exist, in saying that the object develops;
  and then, to neglect them, and to regard the effect as constituted
  merely of its simplest elements. Either these potencies are not in
  the object, or else the object has in it, and is, at the first, more
  than it appears to be. Either the object does not grow, or the lowest
  stage of its being is no explanation of its true nature.</p>

  <p>If we wish to know what the forms of natural life mean, we look in
  vain to their primary state. We must watch the evolution and
  revelation of the secret hid in natural life, as it moves through the
  ascending cycles of the biological kingdom. The idea of evolution,
  when it is not muddled, is synthetic&mdash;not analytic; it explains
  the simplest in the light of the complex, the beginning in the light
  of the end, and not <i>vice versa</i>. In a word, it follows the ways
  of nature, the footsteps of fact, instead of inventing a wilful
  backward path of its own. And nature explains by gradually expanding.
  If we hearken to nature, and not to the voice of illusory
  preconceptions, we shall hear her proclaim at the last <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg216" id="pg216">216</a></span> stage, "Here is
  the meaning of the seedling. Now it is clear what it really was; for
  the power which lay dormant has pushed itself into light, through bud
  and flower and leaf and fruit." The reality of a growing thing is its
  highest form of being. The last explains the first, but not the first
  the last. The first is abstract, incomplete, not yet actual, but mere
  potency; and we could never know even the potency, except in the
  light of its own actualization.</p>

  <p>From this correction of the abstract view of development momentous
  consequences follow. If the universe is, as science pronounces, an
  organic totality, which is ever converting its promise and potency
  into actuality, then we must add that the ultimate interpretation
  even of the lowest existence in the world cannot be given except on
  principles which are adequate to explain the highest. We must "level
  up and not level down": we must not only deny that matter can explain
  spirit, but we must say that even matter itself cannot be fully
  understood, except as an element in a spiritual world."<sup>A</sup></p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: Professor Caird, <i>The Critical Philosophy of Kant</i>, p.
    35.</p>
  </div>

  <p>That the idea of evolution, even when applied in this consistent
  way, has difficulties of its own, it is scarcely necessary to say.
  But there is nothing in it which imperils the ethical and religious
  interests of humanity, or tends to reduce man into a natural
  phenomenon. Instead of degrading man, it lifts nature into a
  manifestation of spirit. If it were <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg217" id="pg217">217</a></span> established, if every link of the
  endless chain were discovered and the continuity of existence were
  irrefragably proved, science would not overthrow idealism, but it
  would rather vindicate it. It would justify <i>in detail</i> the
  attempt of poetry and religion and philosophy, to interpret all being
  as the "transparent vesture" of reason, or love, or whatever other
  power in the world is regarded as highest.</p>

  <p>I have now arrived at the conclusion that was sought. I have tried
  to show, not only that the attempt to interpret nature in terms of
  man is not a superstitious anthropomorphism, but that such an
  interpretation is implied in all rational thought. In other words,
  self-consciousness is the key to all the problems of nature. Science,
  in its progress, is gradually substituting one category for the
  other, and every one of these categories is at once a law of thought
  and a law of things as known. Each category, successively adopted,
  lifts nature more to the level of man; and the last category of
  modern thought, namely, development, constrains us so to modify our
  views of nature, as to regard it as finally explicable only in the
  terms of spirit. Thus, the movement of science is towards idealism.
  Instead of lowering man, it elevates nature into a potency of that
  which is highest and best in man. It represents the life of man, in
  the language of philosophy, as the return of the highest to itself;
  or in the language of our poet, and of religion, as a manifestation
  of infinite love. The explanation of nature from the principle of
  love, if it errs, errs <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg218" id=
  "pg218">218</a></span> "because it is not anthropomorphic enough,"
  not because it is too anthropomorphic; it is not too high and
  concrete a principle, but too low and abstract.</p>

  <p>It now remains to show that the poet, in employing the idea of
  evolution, was aware of its upward direction. I have already quoted a
  few passages which indicate that he had detected the false use of it.
  I shall now quote a few others in which he shows a consciousness of
  its true meaning:</p>

  <p>When nature is thus looked upon from the point of view of its
  final attainment, in the light of the self-consciousness into which
  it ultimately breaks, a new dignity is added to every preceding
  phase. The lowest ceases to be lowest, except in the sense that its
  promise is not fulfilled and its potency not actualized; for,
  throughout the whole process, the activity streams from the highest.
  It is that which is about to be which guides the growing thing and
  gives it unity. The final cause is the efficient cause; the distant
  purpose is the ever-present energy; the last is always first.</p>

  <p>Nor does the poet shrink from calling this highest, this last
  which is also first, by its highest name,&mdash;God.</p>

  phenomena, and find in them law, and beauty, and goodness. The laws
  which he finds by thought are not his inventions, but his
  discoveries. The harmonies are in the organ, if the artist only knows
  how to elicit them. Nay, the connection is still more intimate. It is
  in the thought of man that silent nature finds its voice; it blooms
  into "meaning," significance, thought, in him, as the plant shows its
  beauty in the flower. Nature is making towards humanity, and in

  not make the world beautiful, but finds the beauty that is dwelling
  there. Without him, indeed, the beauty would not be, any more than
  the life of the tree is beautiful until it has evolved its potencies
  into the outward form. Nevertheless, he is the expression of what was
  before, and the beauty was there in potency, awaiting its expression.

  <p>Such is the transmuting power of imagination, that there is
  "nothing but doth suffer change into something rich and strange"; and
  yet the imagination, when loyal to itself, only sees more deeply into
  the truth of things, and gets a closer and fuller hold of facts.</p>

  <p>But, although the human mind thus heals the breach between nature
  and spirit, and discovers the latter in the former, still it is not
  in this way that Browning finally establishes his idealism. For him,
  the principle working in all things is not reason, but love. It is
  from love that all being first flowed; into it all returns through
  man; and in all "the wide compass which is fetched," through the
  infinite variety of forms of being, love is the permanent element and
  the true essence. Nature is on its way back to God, gathering
  treasure as it goes. The static view is not true to facts; it is
  development that for the poet explains the nature of things; and
  development is the evolution of love. Love is for <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg225" id="pg225">225</a></span> Browning the
  highest, richest conception man can form. It is our idea of that
  which is perfect; we cannot even imagine anything better. And the
  idea of evolution necessarily explains the world as the return of the
  highest to itself. The universe is homeward bound.</p>

  <p>Now, whether love is the highest principle or not, I shall not
  inquire at present. My task in this chapter has been to try to show
  that the idea of evolution drives us onward towards some highest
  conception, and then uses that conception as a principle to explain
  all things. If man is veritably higher as a physical organism than
  the bird or reptile, then biology, if it proceeds according to the
  principles of evolution, <i>must</i> seek the meaning of the latter
  in the former, and make the whole kingdom of life a process towards
  man. "Man is no upstart in the creation. His limbs are only a more
  exquisite organization&mdash;say rather the finish&mdash;of the
  rudimental forms that have already been sweeping the sea and creeping
  in the mud." And the same way of thought applies to man as a
  spiritual agent. If spirit be higher than matter, and if love be
  spirit at its best, then the principle of evolution leaves no option
  to the scientific thinker, but to regard all things as potentially
  spirit, and all the phenomena of the world as manifestations of love.
  Evolution necessarily combines all the objects to which it is applied
  into a unity. It knits all the infinite forms of natural life into an
  organism of organisms, so that it is <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg226" id="pg226">226</a></span> a universal life which really lives
  in all animate beings. "Each animal or vegetable form remembers the
  next inferior and predicts the next higher. There is one animal, one
  plant, one matter, and one force." In its still wider application by
  poetry and philosophy, the idea of evolution gathers all being into
  one self-centred totality, and makes all finite existence a movement
  within, and a movement of, that final perfection which, although last
  in order of time, is first in order of potency,&mdash;the
  <i>prius</i> of all things, the active energy <i>in</i> all things,
  and the <i>reality</i> of all things. It is the doctrine of the
  immanence of God; and it reveals "the effort of God, of the supreme
  intellect, in the extreme frontier of His universe."</p>

  <p>In pronouncing, as Browning frequently does, that "after last
  comes first" and "what God once blessed cannot prove accursed"; in
  the boldness of the faith whereby he makes all the inferior grades of
  being into embodiments of the supreme good; in resolving the evils of
  human life, the sorrow, strife, and sin of man into means of man's
  promotion, he is only applying, in a thorough manner, the principle
  on which all modern speculation rests. His conclusions may shock
  common-sense; and they may seem to stultify not only our observation
  of facts, but the testimony of our moral consciousness. But I do not
  know of any principle of speculation which, when elevated into a
  universal principle of thought, will not do the same; and this is why
  the greatest poets and philosophers seem <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg227" id="pg227">227</a></span> to be touched
  with a divine madness. Still, if this be madness, there is a method
  in it. We cannot escape from its logic, except by denying the idea of
  evolution&mdash;the hypothesis by means of which modern thought aims,
  and in the main successfully aims, at reducing the variety of
  existence, and the chaos of ordinary experience, into an order-ruled
  world and a kosmos of articulated knowledge.</p>

  <p>The new idea of evolution differs from that of universal
  causation, to which even the ignorance of our own day has learnt to
  submit, in this mainly&mdash;it does not leave things on the level on
  which it finds them. Both cause and evolution assert the unity of
  being, which, indeed, every one must assume&mdash;even sceptics and
  pessimists; but development represents that unity as self-enriching;
  so that its true nature is revealed, only in the highest form of
  existence which man can conceive. The attempt of poets and
  philosophers to establish a universal synthesis by means of
  evolution, differs from the work which is done by men of science,
  only in the extent of its range and the breadth of its results. It is
  not "idealism," but the scepticism which, in our day, conceals its
  real nature under the name of dualism or agnosticism, that is at war
  with the inner spirit of science. "Not only," we may say of Browning
  as it was said of Emerson by Professor Tyndall, "is his religious
  sense entirely undaunted by the discoveries of science; but all such
  discoveries he comprehends and assimilates. By him scientific
  conceptions <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg228" id=
  "pg228">228</a></span> are continually transmuted into the finer
  forms and warmer hues of an ideal world." And this he does without
  any distortion of the truth. For natural science, to one who
  understands its main tendency, does not militate against philosophy,
  art, and religion; nor threaten to overturn a metaphysic whose
  principle is truth, or beauty, or goodness. Rather, it is gradually
  eliminating the discord of fragmentary existence, and making the
  harmony of the world more and more audible to mankind. It is
  progressively proving that the unity, of which we are all obscurely
  conscious from the first, actually holds in the whole region of its
  survey. The idea of evolution is reconciling science with art and
  religion, in an idealistic conception of the
  universe.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg229" id=

  <h3>BROWNING'S SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF EVIL.</h3>

  <blockquote>
    "Let him, therefore, who would arrive at knowledge of nature, train
    his moral sense, let him act and conceive in accordance with the
    noble essence of his soul; and, as if of herself, nature will
    become open to him. Moral action is that great and only experiment,
    in which all riddles of the most manifold appearances explain
    themselves."<sup>A</sup>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Novalis</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the last chapter, I tried to set forth some considerations that
  justify the attempt to interpret the world by a spiritual principle.
  The conception of development, which modern science and philosophy
  assume as a starting-point for their investigation, was shown to
  imply that the lowest forms of existence can be explained, only as
  stages in the self-realization of that which is highest. This idea
  "levels upwards," and points to self-consciousness as the ultimate
  truth of all things. In other words, it involves that all
  interpretation of the world is anthropomorphic, in the sense that
  what constitutes thought constitutes things, and, therefore, that the
  key to nature is man.</p>

  <p>In propounding this theory of love, and establishing <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg230" id="pg230">230</a></span> an idealism,
  Browning is in agreement with the latest achievement of modern
  thought. For, if the principle of evolution be granted, love is a far
  more adequate hypothesis for the explanation of the nature of things,
  than any purely physical principle. Nay, science itself, in so far as
  it presupposes evolution, tends towards an idealism of this type.
  Whether love be the best expression for that highest principle, which
  is conceived as the truth of being, and whether Browning's treatment
  of it is consistent and valid, I do not as yet inquire. Before
  attempting that task, it must be seen to what extent, and in what
  way, he applies the hypothesis of universal love to the particular
  facts of life. For the present, I take it as admitted that the
  hypothesis is legitimate, as an hypothesis; it remains to ask, with
  what success, if any, we may hope, by its means, to solve the
  contradictions of life, and to gather its conflicting phenomena into
  the unity of an intelligible system. This task cannot be accomplished
  within our limits, except in a very partial manner. I can attempt to
  meet only a few of the more evident and pressing difficulties that
  present themselves, and I can do that only in a very general way.</p>

  <p>The first of these difficulties, or, rather, the main difficulty
  from which all others spring, is that the hypothesis of universal
  love is incompatible with the existence of any kind of evil, whether
  natural or moral. Of this, Browning was well aware. He knew that he
  had brought upon himself the hard task of showing that pain,
  weakness, ignorance, failure, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg231"
  id="pg231">231</a></span> doubt, death, misery, and vice, in all
  their complex forms, can find their legitimate place in a scheme of
  love. And there is nothing more admirable in his attitude, or more
  inspiring in his teaching, than the manly frankness with which he
  endeavours to confront the manifold miseries of human life, and to
  constrain them to yield, as their ultimate meaning and reality, some
  spark of good.</p>

  <p>But, as we have seen, there is a portion of this task in the
  discharge of which Browning is drawn beyond the strict limits of art.
  Neither the magnificent boldness of his religious faith, nor the
  penetration of his artistic insight, although they enabled him to
  deal successfully with the worst samples of human evil, as in <i>The
  Ring and the Book</i>, could dissipate the gloom which reflection
  gathers around the general problem. Art cannot answer the questions
  of philosophy. The difficulties that critical reason raises reason
  alone can lay. Nevertheless, the poet was forced by his reflective
  impulse, to meet that problem in the form in which it presents itself
  in the region of metaphysics. He was conscious of the presuppositions
  within which his art worked, and he sought to justify them. Into this
  region we must now follow him, so as to examine his theory of life,
  not merely as it is implied in the concrete creations of his art, but
  as it is expressed in those later poems, in which he attempts to deal
  directly with the speculative difficulties that crowd around the
  conception of evil.</p>

  <p>To the critic of a philosophy, there is hardly more <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg232" id="pg232">232</a></span> than one task of
  supreme importance. It is that of determining the precise point from
  which the theory he examines takes its departure; for, when the
  central conception is clearly grasped, it will be generally found
  that it rules all the rest. The superstructure of philosophic
  edifices is usually put together in a sufficiently solid
  manner&mdash;it is the foundation that gives way. Hence Hegel, who,
  whatever may be thought of his own theory, was certainly the most
  profound critic of philosophy since Aristotle, generally concentrates
  his attack on the preliminary hypothesis. He brings down the
  erroneous system by removing its foundation-stone. His criticism of
  Spinoza, Kant, Fichte, and Schelling may almost be said to be
  gathered into a single sentence.</p>

  <p>Browning has made no secret of his central conception. It is the
  idea of an immanent or "immundate" love. And that love, we have
  shown, is conceived by him as the supreme moral motive, the ultimate
  essence and end of all self-conscious activity, the veritable nature
  of both man and God.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Denn das Leben ist die Liebe,</p>

    <p>Und des Lebens Leben Geist."</p>
  </div>

  <p>His philosophy of human life rests on the idea that it is the
  realization of a moral purpose, which is a loving purpose. To him
  there is no supreme good, except good character; and the foundation
  of that character by man and in man is the ultimate purpose,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg233" id="pg233">233</a></span> and,
  therefore, the true meaning of all existence.</p>

  deliverance regarding man is, not that he is, nor that he is not, but
  that he is ever becoming. Man is ever at the point of contradiction
  between the actual and ideal, and moving from the latter to the
  former. Strife constitutes him. He is a war of elements; "hurled from
  change to change unceasingly." But rest is death; for it is the

  </div>

  <p>In <i>Paracelsus</i>, <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>, <i>Red Cotton
  Nightcap Country</i>, and many of his other poems, Browning deals
  with the problem of human life from the point of view of development.
  And it is this point of view, consistently held, which enables him to
  throw a new light on the whole subject of ethics. For, if man be
  veritably a being in process <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg235"
  id="pg235">235</a></span> of evolution, if he be a permanent that
  always changes from earliest childhood to old age, if he be a living
  thing, a potency in process of actualization, then no fixed
  distinctions made with reference to him can be true. If, for
  instance, it be asked whether man is rational or irrational, free or
  bound, good or evil, God or brute, the true answer, if he is
  veritably a being moving from ignorance to knowledge, from wickedness
  to virtue, from bondage to freedom, is, that he is at once neither of
  these alternatives and both. All hard terms of division, when applied
  to a subject which grows, are untrue. If the life of man is a
  self-enriching process, if he is <i>becoming</i> good, and rational,
  and free, then at no point in the movement is it possible to pass
  fixed and definite judgments upon him. He must be estimated by his
  direction and momentum, by the whence and whither of his life. There
  is a sense in which man is from the first and always good, rational
  and free; for it is only by the exercise of reason and freedom that
  he exists as man. But there is also a sense in which he is none of
  these; for he is at the first only a potency not yet actualized. He
  is not rational, but becoming rational; not good, but becoming good;
  not free, but aspiring towards freedom. It is his prayer that "in His
  light, he may see light truly, and in His service find perfect
  freedom."</p>

  <p>In this frank assumption of the point of view of development.
  Browning suggests the question whether the endless debate regarding
  freedom, and necessity, and other moral terms, may not spring
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg236" id="pg236">236</a></span> from
  the fact, that both of the opposing schools of ethics are
  fundamentally unfaithful to the subject of their inquiry. They are
  treating a developing reality from an abstract point of view, and
  taking for granted,&mdash;what cannot be true of man, if he grows in
  intellectual power and moral goodness&mdash;that he is <i>either</i>
  good or evil, <i>either</i> rational or irrational, <i>either</i>
  free or bond, at every moment in the process. They are treating man
  from a static, instead of from a kinetic point of view, and
  forgetting that it is his business to acquire the moral and
  intellectual freedom, which he has potentially from the
  first&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i4">"Some fitter way express</p>

  <p>But, whether or not the new point of view renders some of the old
  disputations of ethics meaningless, it is certain that Browning
  viewed moral life as a growth through conflict.</p>

  <p>To become, to develop, to actualize by reaction against the
  natural and moral environment, is the meaning both of the self and of
  the world it works upon. "We are here to learn the good of peace
  through strife, of love through hate, and reach knowledge by
  ignorance."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg237" id=
  "pg237">237</a></span>

  <p>Now, since the conception of development is a self-contradictory
  one, or, in other words, since it necessarily implies the conflict of
  the ideal and actual in all life, and in every instant of its
  history, it remains for us to determine more fully what are the
  warring elements in human nature. What is the nature of this life of
  man, which, like all life, is self-evolving; and by conflict with
  what does the evolution take place? What is the ideal which condemns
  the actual, and yet realizes itself by means of it; and what is the
  actual which wars against the ideal, and yet contains it in potency,
  and reaches towards it? That human life is conceived by Browning as a
  moral life, and not a more refined and complex form of the natural
  life of plants and animals&mdash;a view which finds its exponents in
  Herbert Spencer, and other so-called evolutionists&mdash;it is
  scarcely necessary to assert. It is a life which determines itself,
  and determines itself according to an idea of goodness. That idea,
  moreover, because it is a <i>moral ideal</i>, must be regarded as the
  conception of perfect and absolute goodness. Through the moral end,
  man is ideally identified with God, who, indeed, is necessarily
  conceived as man's moral ideal regarded as already and eternally
  real. "God" and the "moral ideal" are, in truth, expressions of the
  same idea; they convey the conception of perfect goodness from
  different standpoints. And perfect goodness is, to Browning,
  limitless love. Pleasure, wisdom, power, and even the beauty which
  art discovers <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg238" id=
  "pg238">238</a></span> and reveals, together with every other inner
  quality and outer state of being, have only relative worth. "There is
  nothing either in the world or out of it which is unconditionally
  good, except a good will," said Kant; and a good will, according to
  Browning, is a will that wills lovingly. From love all other goodness
  is derived. There is earnest meaning, and not mere sentiment, in the
  poet's assertion that</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"There is no good of life but love&mdash;but love!</p>

    <p>What else looks good, is some shade flung from love.</p>

    <p>Love gilds it, gives it worth. Be warned by me,</p>

    <p>Never you cheat yourself one instant! Love,</p>

    <p>Give love, ask only love, and leave the rest!"<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>In a Balcony</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>"Let man's life be true," he adds, "and love's the truth of mine."
  To attain this truth, that is, to constitute love into the inmost law
  of his being, and permanent source of all his activities, is the task
  of man. And Browning defines that love as</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i8">"Yearning to dispense,</p>

    <p>Each one its own amount of gain thro' its own mode</p>

    <p>Of practising with life."</p>
  </div>

  <p>There is no need of illustrating further the doctrine, so evident
  in Browning, that "love" is the ideal which in man's life makes
  through conflict for its own fulfilment. From what has been already
  said, it is abundantly plain that love is to him a divine element,
  which is at war with all that is lower in man and around him, and
  which by reaction <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg239" id=
  "pg239">239</a></span> against circumstance converts its own mere
  promise into fruition and fact. Through love man's nature reaches
  down to the permanent essence, amid the fleeting phenomena of the
  world, and is at one with what is first and last. As loving he ranks
  with God. No words are too strong to represent the intimacy of the
  relation. For, however limited in range and tainted with alien
  qualities human love may be, it is still "a pin-point rock of His
  boundless continent." It is not a semblance of the divine nature, an
  analogon, or verisimilitude, but the love of God himself in man: so
  that man is in this sense an incarnation of the divine. The Godhood
  in him constitutes him, so that he cannot become himself, or attain
  his own ideal or true nature, except by becoming perfect as God is
  perfect.</p>

  <p>But the emphasis thus laid on the divine worth and dignity of
  human love is balanced by the stress which the poet places on the
  frailty and finitude of every other human attribute. Having elevated
  the ideal, he degrades the actual. Knowledge and the intellectual
  energy which produces it; art and the love of beauty from which it
  springs: every power and every gift, physical and spiritual, other
  than love, has in it the fatal flaw of being merely human. All these
  are so tainted with creatureship, so limited and conditioned, that it
  is hardly too much to say that they are, at their best, deceptive
  endowments. Thus, the life of man regarded as a whole is, in its last
  essence, a combination of utterly disparate elements. The distinction
  of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg240" id=
  "pg240">240</a></span> old moralists between divinity and dust; the
  absolute dualism of the old ascetics between flesh and spirit, sense
  and reason, find their accurate parallel in Browning's teachings. But
  he is himself no ascetic, and the line of distinction he draws does
  not, like theirs, pass between the flesh and the spirit. It rather
  cleaves man's spiritual nature into two portions, which are
  absolutely different from each other. A chasm divides the head from
  the heart, the intellect from the emotions, the moral and practical
  from the perceptive and reflective faculties. And it is this absolute
  cleavage that gives to Browning's teaching, both on ethics and
  religion, one of its most peculiar characteristics. By keeping it
  constantly in sight, we may hope to render intelligible to ourselves
  the solution he offers of the problem of evil, and of other
  fundamental difficulties of the life of man. For, while Browning's
  optimism has its original source in his conception of the unity of
  God and man, through the Godlike quality of love&mdash;even "the
  poorest love that was ever offered"&mdash;he finds himself unable to
  maintain it, except at the expense of degrading man's knowledge.
  Thus, his optimism and faith in God is finally based upon ignorance.
  If, on the side of love, he insists, almost in the spirit of a
  Spinozist, on God's communication of His own substance to man; on the
  side of knowledge he may be called an agnostic, in spite of stray
  expressions which break through his deliberate theory. While "love
  gains God at first leap,"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg241"

  <div class="poem">

  <p>A radical flaw runs through our knowing faculty. Human knowledge
  is not only incomplete&mdash;no one can be so foolish as to deny
  that&mdash;but it is, as regarded by Browning, essentially inadequate
  to the nature of fact, and we must "distrust it, even when it seems
  demonstrable." No professed agnostic can condemn the human intellect
  more utterly than he does. He pushes the limitedness of human
  knowledge into a disqualification of it to reach truth at all; and
  makes the conditions according to which we know, or seem to know,
  into a deceiving necessity, which makes us know wrongly.</p>

  <p>Thought plays around facts, but never reaches them. Mind
  intervenes between itself and its objects, and throws its own shadow
  upon them; nor can it penetrate through that shadow, but deals with
  it as if it were reality, though it knows all the time that it is
  not.</p>

  <p>This theory of knowledge, or rather of nescience or no-knowledge,
  he gives in <i>La Saisiaz</i>, <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i>, <i>The
  Parleyings</i>, and <i>Asolando</i>&mdash;in all his later and more
  reflective poems, in fact. It must, I <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg242" id="pg242">242</a></span> think, be held to be his deliberate
  and final view&mdash;and all the more so, because, by a peculiar
  process, he gets from it his defence of his ethical and religious
  faith.</p>

  <p>In the first of these poems, Browning, while discussing the
  problem of immortality in a purely speculative spirit, and without
  stipulating, "Provided answer suits my hopes, not fears," gives a
  tolerably full account of that which must be regarded as the
  principles of his theory of knowledge. Its importance to his ethical
  doctrine justifies a somewhat exhaustive examination of it.</p>

  <p>He finds himself to be "a midway point, between a cause before and
  an effect behind&mdash;both blanks." Within that narrow space, of the
  self hemmed in by two unknowns, all experience is crammed. Out of
  that experience crowds all that he knows, and all that he misknows.
  There issues from experience&mdash;</p>

  <p>Experience, then, within which he (and every one else)
  acknowledges that all his knowledge is confined, yields him as
  certain facts&mdash;the consciousness <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg243" id="pg243">243</a></span> that he is, but not what he is: the
  consciousness that he is pleased or pained by things about him, whose
  real nature is entirely hidden from him: and, as he tells us just
  before, the assurance that God is the thing the self perceives
  outside itself,</p>

  <p>But, even this knowledge, limited as it is to the bare existence
  of unknown entities, has the further defect of being merely
  subjective. The "experience" from which he draws his conclusions, is
  his own in an exclusive sense. His "thinking thing" has, apparently,
  no elements in common with the "thinking things" of other selves. He
  ignores the fact that there may be general laws of thought, according
  to which his mind must act in order to be a mind. Intelligence seems
  to have no nature, and may be anything. All questions regarding
  "those apparent other mortals" are consequently unanswerable to the
  poet. "Knowledge stands on my experience"; and this "my" is totally
  unrelated to all other Mes.</p>

  <p>If there were only they two on earth as tenants, there would be no
  way of deciding between them; for, according to his argument, the
  truth is apparently decided by majority of opinions. Each individual,
  equipped with his own particular kind of senses and reason, gets his
  own particular experience, and draws his own particular conclusions
  from it. If it be asked whether these conclusions are true or not,
  the only answer is that the question is absurd; for, under such
  conditions, there cannot be either truth or error. Every one's
  opinion is its own criterion. Each man is the measure of all things;
  "His own world for every mortal," as the poet puts it.</p>

  <p>It is hardly necessary to enter upon any detailed criticism of
  such a theory of knowledge as this, which is proffered by the poet.
  It is well known by all those who are in some degree acquainted with
  the history of philosophy&mdash;and it will be easily seen by all who
  have any critical acumen&mdash;that it leads directly into absolute
  scepticism. And absolute scepticism is easily shown to be
  self-contradictory. For a theory of nescience, in condemning all
  knowledge and the faculty of knowledge, condemns itself. If nothing
  is true, or if nothing is known, then this theory itself is not true,
  or its truth cannot be known. And if this theory is true, then
  nothing is true; for this theory, like all others, is the product of
  a defective intelligence. In whatsoever way the matter is put, there
  is left no standing-ground for the human critic who condemns human
  thought. And he cannot well pretend to a footing in a sphere above
  man's, or below it. There is thus one presupposition which every one
  must make, if he is to propound any doctrine whatsoever, even if that
  doctrine be that no doctrine can be <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg247" id="pg247">247</a></span> valid; it is the presupposition
  that knowledge is possible, and that truth can be known. And this
  presupposition fills, for modern philosophy, the place of the
  <i>Cogito ergo sum</i> of Descartes. It is the starting-point and
  criterion of all knowledge.</p>

  <p>It is, at first sight, a somewhat difficult task to account for
  the fact, that so keen an intellect as the poet's did not perceive
  the conclusion to which his theory of knowledge so directly and
  necessarily leads. It is probable, however, that he never critically
  examined it, but simply accepted it as equivalent to the common
  doctrine of the relativity of knowledge, which, in some form or
  other, all the schools of philosophy adopt. But the main reason will
  be found to lie in the fact that knowledge was not, to Browning, its
  own criterion or end. The primary fact of his philosophy is that
  human life is a moral process. His interest in the evolution of
  character was his deepest interest, as he informs us; he was an
  ethical teacher rather than a metaphysician. He is ever willing to
  asperse man's intelligence. But that man is a moral agent he will in
  no wise doubt. This is his</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i6">"Solid standing-place amid</p>

    <p>A: <i>Francis Furini</i>.</p>

  <p>His practical maxim was</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Wholly distrust thy knowledge, then, and trust</p>

  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg248" id="pg248">248</a></span>

  <p>All phenomena must, in some way or other, be reconciled by the
  poet with the fundamental and indubitable fact of the progressive
  moral life of man. For the fundamental presupposition which a man
  makes, is necessarily his criterion of knowledge, and it determines
  the truth or illusoriness of all other opinions whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Now, Browning held, not only that no certain knowledge is
  attainable by man, but also that such certainty is incompatible with
  moral life. Absolute knowledge would, he contends, lift man above the
  need and the possibility of making the moral choice, which is our
  supreme business on earth. Man can be good or evil, only on condition
  of being in absolute uncertainty regarding the true meaning of the
  facts of nature and the phenomena of life.</p>

  <p>This somewhat strange doctrine finds the most explicit and full
  expression in <i>La Saisiaz</i>. "Fancy," amongst the concessions it
  demands from "Reason," claims that man should know&mdash;not merely
  surmise or fear&mdash;that every action done in this life awaits its
  proper and necessary meed in the next.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i8">"I also will that man become aware</p>

    depends."<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>La Saisiaz</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>But Reason refuses the concession, upon the ground that such sure
  knowledge would be destructive of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg249" id="pg249">249</a></span> the very distinction between right
  and wrong, which the demand implies. The "promulgation of this
  decree," by Fancy, "makes both good and evil to cease." Prior to it
  "earth was man's probation-place"; but under this decree man is no
  longer free; for certain knowledge makes action necessary.</p>

  <p>If we presuppose that "man, addressed this mode, be sound and
  sane" (and we must stipulate sanity, if his actions are to be morally
  judged at all)&mdash;then a law which binds punishment and reward to
  action in a necessary manner, and is known so to bind them, would
  "obtain prompt and absolute obedience." There are some "edicts, now
  styled God's own nature's," "which to hear means to obey." All the
  laws relating to the preservation of life are of this character. And,
  if the law&mdash;"Would'st thou live again, be just"&mdash;were in
  all ways as stringent as the other law&mdash;</p>

  <p>then no one would disobey it, nor could. "It is <span class=

  doing evil that gives the doing good a grace." And that liberty would
  be taken away by complete assurance, that effects follow actions in
  the moral world with the necessity seen in the natural sphere. Since,
  therefore, man is made to grow, and earth is the place wherein he is
  to pass probation and prove his powers, there must remain a certain
  doubt as to the issues of his actions; conviction must not be so
  strong as to carry with it man's whole nature. "The best I both see
  and praise, the worst I follow," is the adage rife in man's mouth
  regarding his moral conduct. But, spite of his seeing and
  praising,</p>

  <p>The more orthodox and less generous individual is prone to agree,
  as regards himself, with Burns; but, he sees, most probably, that
  such an escape is impossible to others. He has secret solacement in a
  latent belief that he himself is an exception. There will be a
  special method of dealing with <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg251"
  id="pg251">251</a></span> him. He is a "chosen sample"; and "God will
  think twice before He damns a man of his quality." It is just because
  there is such doubt as to the universality and necessity of the law
  which connects actions and consequences in the moral sphere, that
  man's deeds have an ethical character; while, to disperse doubt and
  ignorance by the assurance of complete knowledge, would take the good
  from goodness and the ill from evil.</p>

  <p>In this ingenious manner, the poet turns the imperfect intellect
  and delusive knowledge of man to a moral use. Ordinarily, the
  intellectual impotence of man is regarded as carrying with it moral
  incapacity as well, and the delusiveness of knowledge is one of the
  strongest arguments for pessimism. To persons pledged to the support
  of no theory, and to those who have the <i>naïveté</i>, so hard to
  maintain side by side with strong doctrinal convictions, it seems
  amongst the worst of evils that man should be endowed with fallacious
  faculties, and cursed with a futile desire for true knowledge which
  is so strong, that it cannot be quenched even in those who believe
  that truth can never be attained. It is the very best men of the
  world who cry</p>

  <p>The poet himself was burdened in no small degree with this vain
  desire for knowing the truth; and he recognized, too, that he was
  placed in a world which seems both real and beautiful, and so well
  worth knowing. Yet, it is this very failure of knowledge&mdash;a
  failure which, be it remembered, is complete and absolute, because,
  as he thinks, all facts must turn into phantoms by mere contact with
  our "relative intelligences,"&mdash;which he constitutes into the
  basis of his optimistic faith.</p>

  <p>So high is the dignity and worth of the moral life to Browning,
  that no sacrifice is too great to secure it. And, indeed, if it were
  once clearly recognized that there is no good thing but goodness,
  nothing of supreme worth, except the realization of a loving will,
  then doubt, ignorance, and every other form of apparent evil would be
  fully justified&mdash;provided they were conditions whereby this
  highest good is attained. And, to Browning, ignorance was one of the
  conditions. And consequently, the dread pause in the music which
  agnosticism brings, is only "silence implying sound"; and the vain
  cry for truth, arising from the heart of the earth's best men, is
  only a discord moving towards resolution into a more rapturous
  harmony.</p>

  <p>I do not stay here to inquire whether sure knowledge would really
  have this disastrous effect of destroying morality, or whether its
  failure does not rather imply the impossibility of a moral life. I
  return to the question asked at the beginning of this chapter, and
  which it is now possible to <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg253" id=
  "pg253">253</a></span> answer. That question was: How does Browning
  reconcile his hypothesis of universal love with the natural and moral
  evils existing in the world?</p>

  <p>His answer is quite explicit. The poet solves the problem by
  casting doubt upon the facts which threaten his hypothesis. He
  reduces them into phenomena, in the sense of phantoms begotten by the
  human intellect upon unknown and unknowable realities.</p>

  <p>It is the mixture, or rather the apparent mixture, of shade and

  <p>Certainty on either side, either that evil is evil for

  evermore, irredeemable and absolute, a drench of utter dark not
  illuminable by white; or that it is but mere show and semblance,
  which the good takes upon itself, would alike be ruinous to man. For
  both alternatives would render all striving folly. The right attitude
  for man is that of ignorance, complete uncertainty, the equipoise of
  conflicting alternatives. He must take his stand on the
  contradiction. Hope he may have that all things work together for
  good. It is right that he should nourish the faith that the
  antagonism of evil with good in the world is only an illusion; but
  that faith must stop short of the complete conviction that knowledge
  would bring. When, therefore, the hypothesis of universal love is
  confronted with the evils of life, and we ask how it can be
  maintained in the face of the manifold miseries everywhere apparent,
  the poet answers, "You do not know, and cannot know, whether they are
  evils or not. Your knowledge remains at the surface of things. You
  cannot fit them into their true place, or pronounce upon their true
  purpose and character; for you see only a small arc of the complete
  circle of being. Wait till you see more, and, in the meantime,
  hope!"</p>

  leaves as little room for his scheme of love as it does for its
  opposite, he again answers: "Not so! I appeal from the intellect,
  which is detected as incompetent, to the higher court of the moral
  consciousness. And there I find the ignorance to be justified: for it
  is the instrument of a higher purpose, a means whereby what is best
  is gained, namely, <i>Love</i>."</p>

  <p>Now, in order to complete our examination of this theory, we must
  follow the poet in his attempt to escape from the testimony of the
  intellect to that of the heart. In order to make the most of the
  latter, we find that Browning, especially in his last work, tends to
  withdraw his accusation of utter incompetence on the part of the
  intellect. He only tends to do so, it is true. He is tolerably
  consistent in asserting that we know our own emotions and the
  phenomena of our own consciousness; but he is not consistent in his
  account of our knowledge, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg258" id=
  "pg258">258</a></span> or ignorance, of external things. On the
  whole, he asserts that we know nothing of them. But in
  <i>Asolando</i> he seems to imply that the evidence of a loveless
  power in the world, permitting evil, is irresistible.<sup>A</sup> To say the
  least, the testimony of the intellect, such as it is, is more clear
  and convincing with regard to evil than it is with regard to good.
  Within the sphere of phenomena, to which the intellect is confined,
  there seems to be, instead of a benevolent purpose, a world ruled by
  a power indifferent to the triumph of evil over good, and either
  "loveless" or unintelligent.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>See passage just quoted.</i></p>

  <p>And it is not possible for man to contravene this evidence of
  faults and omissions: for, in doing so, he would remove the facts in
  reaction against which his moral nature becomes active. What proof is
  there, then, that the universal love is no mere dream? None! from the
  side of the intellect, answers the poet. Man, who has the will to
  remove the ills of life,</p>

  <p>has not the power to effect his will; while the Power, whose
  limitlessness he recognizes everywhere <span class="pagenum"><a name=

  <p>But if the intellect is thus overwhelmed, so as to be almost
  passive to the pessimistic conclusion borne in upon it by "resistless
  fact," the heart of man is made of another mould. It revolts against
  the conclusion of the intellect, and climbs</p>

  <div class="poem">

    <p>C: <i>Ibid</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It grasps a fact beyond the reach of knowledge, namely, the
  possibility, or even the certainty, that "power is love." At present
  there is no substantiating by knowledge the testimony of the heart;
  and man has no better anchorage for his optimism than faith. But the
  closer view will come, when even our life on earth will be seen to
  have within it the working of love, no less manifest than that of
  power.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"When see? When there dawns a day,</p>

    <p class="i2">If not on the homely earth,</p>

  <p>Now, what is this evidence of the heart, which is sufficiently
  cogent and valid to counterpoise that of the mind; and which gives to
  "faith," or "hope," a firm foothold in the very face of the opposing
  "resistless" testimony of knowledge?</p>

  <p>Within our experience, to which the poet knows we are entirely
  confined, there is a fact, the significance of which we have not as
  yet examined. For, plain and irresistible as is the evidence of evil,
  so plain and constant is man's recognition of it as evil, and his
  desire to annul it. If man's mind is made to acknowledge evil, his
  moral nature is made so as to revolt against it.</p>

  <p>But the moral worth of man does not suffer the least detraction

  <p>Now, this fact of inner experience, which the poet thinks
  incontrovertible&mdash;the fact that man, every man, necessarily
  regards evil, whether natural or moral, as something to be annulled,
  were it only possible&mdash;is an immediate proof of the indwelling
  of that which is highest in man. On this basis, Browning is able to
  re-establish the optimism which, from the side of knowledge, he had
  utterly abandoned.</p>

  <p>The very fact that the world is condemned by man is proof that
  there dwells in man something better than the world, whose evidence
  the pessimist himself cannot escape. All is not wrong, as long as
  wrong <i>seems</i> wrong. The pessimist, in condemning the world,
  must except himself. In his <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg264" id=

  His anger, there lies a contradiction; for he himself fronts and
  defies the outrage. There is no depth of despair which this good

  </div>

  <p>To any one capable of spiritually discerning things, there can be
  no difficulty in regarding goodness, however limited and mated with
  weakness, as infinitely above all natural power. Divinity will be
  known to consist, not in any senseless might, however majestic and
  miraculous, but in moral or spiritual perfection. If God were
  indifferent to the evil of the world, acquiesced in it without
  reason, and let it ripen into all manner of wretchedness, then man,
  in condemning the world, though without power to remove the least of
  its miseries, would be higher than God. But we have still to account
  for the possibility of man's assuming an attitude implied in the
  consciousness that, while he is without power, God is without pity,
  and in the despair which springs from his hate of evil. How comes it
  that human nature rises above its origin, and is able&mdash;nay,
  obliged&mdash;to condemn the evil which God permits? Is man finite in
  power, a mere implement of a mocking will so far as knowledge goes,
  the plaything of remorseless forces, and yet author and first source
  of something in himself which invests him with a dignity that God
  Himself cannot share? Is the moral consciousness which, by its very
  nature, must <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg266" id=
  "pg266">266</a></span> bear witness against the Power, although it
  cannot arrest its pitiless course, or remove the least evil,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Man's own work, his birth of heart and brain,</p>

    <p>His native grace, no alien gift at all?"</p>
  </div>

  <p>We are thus caught between the horns of a final dilemma. Either
  the pity and love, which make man revolt against all suffering, are
  man's own creation; or else God, who made man's heart to love, has
  given to man something higher than He owns Himself. But both of these
  alternatives are impossible.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Here's the touch that breaks the bubble."</p>
  </div>

  <p>The first alternative is impossible, because man is by definition
  powerless, a mere link in the endless chain of causes, incapable of
  changing the least part of the scheme of things which he condemns,
  and therefore much more unable to initiate, or to bring into a
  loveless world abandoned to blind power, the noble might of love.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>A Bean-Stripe</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>I shall not pause at present to examine the value of this new form
  of the old argument, "<i>Ex contingentia mundi</i>." But I may point
  out in passing, that the reference of human love to a divine creative
  source is accomplished by means of the idea of cause, one of the
  categories of the thought which Browning has aspersed. And it is a
  little difficult to show why, if we are constrained to doubt our
  thought, when by the aid of causality it establishes a connection
  between finite and finite, we should regard it as worthy of trust
  when it connects the finite and the infinite. In fact, it is all too
  evident that the poet assumes or denies the possibility of knowledge,
  according as it helps or hinders his ethical doctrine.</p>

  <p>But, if we grant the ascent from the finite to the infinite and
  regard man's love as a divine gift&mdash;which it may well be
  although the poet's argument is invalid&mdash;then a new light is
  thrown upon the being who gave man this power to love. The
  "necessity," "the mere power," which alone could be discerned by
  observation of the irresistible movement of the world's events,
  acquires a new character. Prior to this discovery of love in man as
  the work of God&mdash;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg268" id=

  </div>

  <p>But love in man is a suggestion of a love without; a proof, in
  fact, that God is love, for man's love is God's love in man. The
  source of the pity that man shows, and of the apparent evils in the
  world which excite it, is the same. The power which called man into
  being, itself rises up in man against the wrongs in the world. The
  voice of the moral consciousness, approving the good, condemning
  evil, and striving to annul it, is the voice of God, and has,
  therefore, supreme authority. We do wrong, therefore, in thinking
  that it is the weakness of man which is matched against the might of
  evil in the world, and that we are fighting a losing battle. It is an
  incomplete, abstract, untrue view of the facts of life which puts God
  as irresistible Power in the outer world, and forgets that the same
  irresistible Power works, under the higher form of love, in the human
  heart.</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>B: <i>A Death in the Desert</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In this way, therefore, the poet argues back from the moral
  consciousness of man to the goodness of God. And he finds the
  ultimate proof of this <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg269" id=
  "pg269">269</a></span> goodness in the very pessimism and scepticism
  and despair, that come with the view of the apparently infinite waste
  in the world and the endless miseries of humanity. The source of this
  despair, namely, the recognition of evil and wrong, is just the
  Godhood in man. There is no way of accounting for the fact that "Man
  hates what is and loves what should be," except by "blending the
  quality of man with the quality of God." And "the quality of God" is
  the fundamental fact in man's history. Love is the last reality the
  poet always reaches. Beneath the pessimism is love: without love of
  the good there were no recognition of evil, no condemnation of it,
  and no despair.</p>

  <p>But the difficulty still remains as to the permission of evil,
  even though it should prove in the end to be merely apparent.</p>

  <p>He who places rest above effort, Rephan above the earth, places a
  natural good above a moral good, stagnation above progress. The
  demand for the absolute extinction of evil betrays ignorance of the
  nature of the highest good. For right and wrong are relative. "Type
  need antitype." The fact that goodness is best, and that goodness is
  not a stagnant state but a progress, a gradual realization, though
  never complete, of an infinite ideal, of the perfection of God by a
  finite being, necessarily implies the consciousness of sin and evil.
  As a moral agent man must set what should be above what is. If he is
  to aspire and attain, the actual present must seem to him inadequate,
  imperfect, wrong, a state to be abolished in favour of a better. And
  therefore it follows that</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i8">"Though wrong were right</p>

    <p>Could we but know&mdash;still wrong must needs seem wrong</p>

    <p>To do right's service, prove men weak or strong,</p>

    <p>Choosers of evil or good."<sup>B</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">

  </div>

  <p>The apparent existence of evil is the condition of <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg272" id="pg272">272</a></span> goodness. And yet
  it must only be apparent. For if evil be regarded as veritably evil,
  it must remain so for all that man can do; he cannot annihilate any
  fact nor change its nature, and all effort would, therefore, be
  futile. And, on the other hand, if evil were known as unreal, then
  there were no need of moral effort, no quarrel with the present and
  therefore no aspiration, and no achievement. That which is man's
  highest and best,&mdash;namely, a moral life which is a
  progress&mdash;would thus be impossible, and his existence would be
  bereft of all meaning and purpose. And if the highest is impossible
  then all is wrong, "the goal being a ruin, so is all the rest."</p>

  <p>The hypothesis of the moral life as progressive is essential to
  Browning.</p>

  <p>But if this hypothesis be granted, then all difficulties
  disappear. The conception of the endless acquirement of goodness at
  once postulates the consciousness of evil, and the consciousness of
  it as existing in order to be overcome. Hence the consciousness of it
  as illusion comes nearest to the truth. And such a conception is
  essentially implied by the idea of morality. To speculative reason,
  however, it is impossible, as the poet believes, that evil should
  thus be at the same time regarded as both real and unreal. Knowledge
  leads to despair on every side; for, whether it takes the evil in the
  world as seeming or actual, it stultifies effort, and proves that
  moral progress, which is best of all things, is impossible. But the
  moral consciousness derives its vitality from this contradiction. It
  is <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg273" id="pg273">273</a></span>
  the meeting-point and conflict of actual and ideal; and its testimony
  is indisputable, however inconsistent it may be with that of
  knowledge. Acknowledging absolute ignorance of the outer world, the
  poet has still a retreat within himself, safe from all doubt. He has
  in his own inner experience irrefragable proof</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i2">"How things outside, fact or feigning, teach</p>

    <p>What good is and what evil&mdash;just the same,</p>

    <p>Be feigning or be fact the teacher."<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Francis Furini</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The consciousness of being taught goodness by interaction with the
  outside unknown is sufficient; it is "a point of vantage" whence he
  will not be moved by any contradictions that the intellect may
  conjure up against it. And this process of learning goodness, this
  gradual realization by man of an ideal infinitely high and absolute
  in worth, throws back a light which illumines all the pain and strife
  and despair, and shows them all to be steps in the endless
  "love-way." The consciousness of evil is thus at once the effect and
  the condition of goodness. The unrealized, though ever-realizing
  good, which brings despair, is the best fact in man's history; and it
  should rightly bring, not despair, but endless joy.</p><span class=

  <h3>A CRITICISM OF BROWNING'S VIEW OF THE FAILURE OF KNOWLEDGE.</h3>

  <blockquote>
    "Der Mensch, da er Geist ist, darf und soll sich selbst des
    höchsten würdig achten, von der Grösse und Macht seines Geistes
    kann er nicht gross genug denken; und mit diesem Glauben wird
    nichts so spröde und hart seyn, das sich ihm nicht eröffnete. Das
    zuerst verborgene und verschlossene Wesen des Universums hat keine
    Kraft, die dem Muthe des Erkennens Widerstand leisten könnte: es
    muss sich vor ihm aufthun, und seinen Reichthum und seine Tiefen
    ihm vor Augen legen und zum Genusse geben."<sup>A</sup>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Hegel's Inaugural Address at Heidelberg</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Before entering upon a criticism of Browning's theory, as
  represented in the last chapter, it may be well to give a brief
  summary of it.</p>

  <p>The most interesting feature of Browning's proof of his optimistic
  faith is his appeal from the intelligence to the moral consciousness.
  To show theoretically that evil is merely phenomenal is, in his view,
  both impossible and undesirable. It is impossible, because the human
  intellect is incapable of knowing anything as it really is, or of
  pronouncing upon the ultimate nature of any phenomenon. It is
  undesirable, because a theoretical proof of the <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg275" id="pg275">275</a></span> evanescence of
  evil would itself give rise to the greatest of all evils. The best
  thing in the world is moral character. Man exists in order to grow
  better, and the world exists in order to help him. But moral growth
  is possible only through conflict against evil, or what seems to be
  evil; hence, to disprove the existence of evil would be to take away
  the possibility of learning goodness, to stultify all human effort,
  and to deprive the world of its meaning.</p>

  <p>But, if an optimistic doctrine cannot be reached by way of
  speculative thought, if the intellect of man cannot see the good in
  things evil, his moral consciousness guarantees that all is for the
  best, and that "the good is all in all." For, in distinguishing
  between good and evil, the moral consciousness sets up an ideal over
  against the actual. It conceives of a scheme of goodness which is not
  realized in the world, and it condemns the world as it is. Man, as
  moral being, is so constituted that he cannot but regard the evil in
  the world as something to be annulled. If he had only the power,
  there would be no pain, no sorrow, no weakness, no failure, no death.
  Is man, then, better than the Power which made the world and let woe
  gain entrance into it? No! answers the poet; for man himself is part
  of that world and the product of that Power. The Power that made the
  world also made the moral consciousness which condemns the world; if
  it is the source of the evil in the world, it is also the source of
  that love in man, which, by self-expenditure, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg276" id="pg276">276</a></span> seeks to remedy
  it. If the external world is merely an expression of a remorseless
  Power, whence comes the love which is the principle of the moral life
  in man? The same Power brings the antidote as well as the bane. And,
  further, the bane exists for the sake of the antidote, the wrong for
  the sake of the remedy. The evil in the world is means to a higher
  good, and the only means possible; for it calls into activity the
  divine element in man, and thereby contributes to its realization in
  his character. It gives the necessary opportunity for the exercise of
  love.</p>

  <p>Hence, evil cannot be regarded as ultimately real. It is real only
  as a stage in growth, as means to an end; and the means necessarily
  perishes, or is absorbed in, the attainment of the end. It has no
  significance except by reference to that end. From this point of
  view, evil is the resistance which makes progress possible, the
  negative which gives meaning to the positive, the darkness that makes
  day beautiful. This must not, however, be taken to mean that evil is
  nothing. It is resistance; it is negative; it does oppose the good;
  although its opposition is finally overcome. If it did not, if evil
  were unreal, there would be no possibility of calling forth the moral
  potency of man, and the moral life would be a figment. But these two
  conditions of the moral life&mdash;on the one hand, that the evil of
  the world must be capable of being overcome and is there for the
  purpose of being overcome, and that it is unreal except as a means to
  the good; and, on <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg277" id=
  "pg277">277</a></span> the other hand, that evil must be actually
  opposed to the good, if the good is to have any
  meaning,&mdash;cannot, Browning thinks, be reconciled with each
  other. It is manifest that the intellect of man cannot, at the same
  time, regard evil as both real and unreal. It must assert the one and
  deny the other; or else we must regard its testimony as altogether
  untrustworthy. But the first alternative is destructive of the moral
  consciousness. Moral life is alike impossible whether we deny or
  assert the real existence of evil. The latter alternative stultifies
  knowledge, and leaves all the deeper concerns of life&mdash;the
  existence of good and evil, the reality of the distinction between
  them, the existence of God, the moral governance of the world, the
  destiny of man&mdash;in a state of absolute uncertainty. We must
  reject the testimony either of the heart or of the head.</p>

  <p>Browning, as we have seen, unhesitatingly adopts the latter
  alternative. He remains loyal to the deliverances of his moral
  consciousness and accepts as equally valid, beliefs which the
  intellect finds to be self-contradictory: holding that knowledge on
  such matters is impossible. And he rejects this knowledge, not only
  because our thoughts are self-contradictory in themselves, but
  because the failure of a speculative solution of these problems is
  necessary to morality. Clear, convincing, demonstrative knowledge
  would destroy morality; and the fact that the power to attain such
  knowledge has been withheld from us is to be regarded rather as an
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg278" id="pg278">278</a></span>
  indication of the beneficence of God, who has not held even ignorance
  to be too great a price for man to pay for goodness.</p>

  <p>Knowledge is not the fit atmosphere for morality. It is faith and
  not reason, hope and trust but not certainty, that lend vigour to the
  good life. We may believe, and rejoice in the belief, that the
  absolute good is fulfilling itself in all things, and that even the
  miseries of life are really its refracted rays&mdash;the light that
  gains in splendour by being broken. But we must not, and, indeed,
  cannot ascend from faith to knowledge. The heart may trust, and must
  trust, if it faithfully listens to its own natural voice; but reason
  must not demonstrate. Ignorance on the side of intellect, faith on
  the side of the emotions; distrust of knowledge, absolute confidence
  in love; such is the condition of man's highest welfare: it is only
  thus that the purpose of his life, and of the world which is his
  instrument, can be achieved.</p>

  <p>No final estimate of the value of this theory of morals and
  religion can be made, without examining its philosophical
  presuppositions. Nor is such an examination in any way unfair; for it
  is obvious that Browning explicitly offers us a philosophical
  doctrine. He appeals to argument and not to artistic intuition; he
  offers a definite theory to which he claims attention, not on account
  of any poetic beauty that may lie within it, but on the ground that
  it is a true exposition of the moral nature of man. Kant's
  <i>Metaphysic of Ethics</i> is not <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg279" id="pg279">279</a></span> more metaphysical in intention than
  the poet's later utterances on the problems of morality. In <i>La
  Saisiaz</i>, in <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i>, in the <i>Parleyings</i>,
  and, though less explicitly, in <i>Asolando</i>, <i>Fifine at the
  Fair</i>, and <i>Red Cotton Nightcap Country</i>, Browning definitely
  states, and endeavours to demonstrate a theory of knowledge, a theory
  of the relation of knowledge to morality, and a theory of the nature
  of evil; and he discusses the arguments for the immortality of the
  soul. In these poems his artistic instinct avails him, not as in his
  earlier ones, for the discovery of truth by way of intuition, but for
  the adornment of doctrines already derived from a metaphysical
  repository. His art is no longer free, no longer its own end, but
  coerced into an alien service. It has become illustrative and
  argumentative, and in being made to subserve speculative purposes, it
  has ceased to be creative. Browning has appealed to philosophy, and
  philosophy must try his cause.</p>

  <p>Such, then, is Browning's theory; and I need make no further
  apology for discussing at some length the validity of the division
  which it involves between the intellectual and the moral life of man.
  Is it possible to combine the weakness of man's intelligence with the
  strength of his moral and religious life, and to find in the former
  the condition of the latter? Does human knowledge fail, as the poet
  considers it to fail? Is the intelligence of man absolutely incapable
  of arriving at knowledge of things as they are? If it does, if man
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg280" id="pg280">280</a></span>
  cannot know the truth, can he attain goodness? These are the
  questions that must now be answered.</p>

  <p>It is one of the characteristics of recent thought that it
  distrusts its own activity: the ancient philosophical "Scepticism"
  has been revived and strengthened. Side by side with the sense of the
  triumphant progress of natural science, there is a conviction, shared
  even by scientific investigators themselves, as well as by religious
  teachers and by many students of philosophy, that our knowledge has
  only limited and relative value, and that it always stops short of
  the true nature of things. The reason of this general conviction lies
  in the fact that thought has become aware of its own activity; men
  realize more clearly than they did in former times that the apparent
  constitution of things depends directly on the character of the
  intelligence which apprehends them.</p>

  <p>This relativity of things to thought has, not unnaturally,
  suggested the idea that the objects of our knowledge are different
  from objects as they are. "That the real nature of things is very
  different from what we make of them, that thought and thing are
  divorced, that there is a fundamental antithesis between them," is,
  as Hegel said, "the hinge on which modern philosophy turns." Educated
  opinion in our day has lost its naive trust in itself. "The natural
  belief of man, it is true, ever gives the lie" to the doctrine that
  we do not know things. "In common life," adds Hegel, "we reflect
  without particularly noting that this is the process <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg281" id="pg281">281</a></span> of arriving at
  the truth, and we think without hesitation and in the firm belief
  that thought coincides with things."<sup>A</sup> But, as soon as attention is
  directed to the process of thinking, and to the way in which the
  process affects our consciousness of the object, it is at once
  concluded that thought will never reach reality, that things are not
  given to us as they are, but distorted by the medium of sense and our
  intelligence, through which they pass. The doctrine of the relativity
  of knowledge is thus very generally regarded as equivalent to the
  doctrine that there is no true knowledge whatsoever. We know only
  phenomena, or appearances; and it is these, and not veritable facts,
  that we systematize into sciences. "We can arrange the
  appearances&mdash;the shadows of our cave&mdash;and that, for the
  practical purposes of the cave, is all that we require."<sup>B</sup> Not even
  "earth's least atom" can ever be known to us as it really is; it is
  for us, at the best,</p>

  <p>In this general distrust of knowledge, however, there are, as
  might be expected, many different degrees. Its origin in modern times
  was, no doubt, the doctrine of Kant. "This divorce of thing and
  thought," says Hegel, "is mainly the work of the critical philosophy
  and runs counter to the conviction <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg282" id="pg282">282</a></span> of all previous ages." And the
  completeness of the divorce corresponds, with tolerable accuracy, to
  the degree in which the critical philosophy has been understood; for
  Kant's writings, like those of all great thinkers, are capable of
  many interpretations, varying in depth with the intelligence of the
  interpreters.</p>

  <p>The most common and general form of this view of the limitation of
  the human intelligence is that which places the objects of religious
  faith beyond the reach of human knowledge. We find traces of it in
  much of the popular theology of our day. The great facts of religion
  are often spoken of as lying in an extra-natural sphere, beyond
  experience, into which men cannot enter by the native right of
  reason. It is asserted that the finite cannot know the infinite, that
  the nature of God is unknowable&mdash;except by means of a
  supernatural interference, which gives to men a new power of
  spiritual discernment, and "reveals" to them things which are "above
  reason," although not contrary to it. The theologian often shields
  certain of his doctrines from criticism, on the ground, as he
  contends, that there are facts which we must believe, but which it
  would be presumptuous for us to pretend to understand or to
  demonstrate. They are the proper objects of "faith."</p>

  <p>But this view of the weakness of the intelligence when applied to
  supersensuous facts, is held along with an undisturbed conviction of
  the validity of our knowledge of ordinary objects. It is believed,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg283" id="pg283">283</a></span> in a
  word, that there are two kinds of realities,&mdash;natural and
  supernatural; and that the former is knowable and the latter not.</p>

  <p>It requires, however, no great degree of intellectual acumen to
  discover that this denial of the validity of our knowledge of these
  matters involves its denial in all its applications. The ordinary
  knowledge of natural objects, which we begin by regarding as valid,
  or, rather, whose validity is taken for granted without being
  questioned, depends upon our ideas of these supersensible objects. In
  other words, those fundamental difficulties which pious opinion
  discovers in the region of theology, and which, as is thought, fling
  the human intellect back upon itself into a consciousness of frailty
  and finitude, are found to lurk beneath our ordinary knowledge.
  Whenever, for instance, we endeavour to know any object, we find that
  we are led back along the line of its conditions to that which
  unconditionally determines it. For we cannot find the reason for a
  particular object in a particular object. We are driven back
  endlessly from one to another along the chain of causes; and we can
  neither discover the first link nor do without it. The first link
  must be a cause of itself, and experience yields none such. Such a
  cause would be the unconditioned, and the unconditioned we cannot
  know. The final result of thinking is thus to lead us to an unknown;
  and, in consequence, all our seeming knowledge is seen to have no
  intelligible basis, and, therefore, to be merely hypothetical. If
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg284" id="pg284">284</a></span> we
  cannot know God, we cannot know anything.</p>

  <p>This view is held by the Positivists, and the most popular English
  exponent of it is, perhaps, Mr. Herbert Spencer. Its characteristic
  is its repudition of both theology and metaphysics as
  pseudo-sciences, and its high esteem for science. That esteem is not
  disturbed by the confession that "noumenal causes,"&mdash;that is,
  the actual reality of things,&mdash;are unknown; for we can still lay
  claim to valid knowledge of the laws of phenomena. Having
  acknowledged that natural things as known are merely phenomena,
  positivism treats them in all respects as if they were realities; and
  it rejoices in the triumphant progress of the natural sciences as if
  it were a veritable growth of knowledge. It does not take to heart
  the phenomenal nature of known objects. But, having paid its formal
  compliments to the doctrine of the relativity of all knowledge, it
  neglects it altogether.</p>

  <p>Those who understand Kant better carry his scepticism further, and
  they complete the divorce between man's knowledge and reality. The
  process of knowing, they hold, instead of leading us towards facts,
  as it was so long supposed to do, takes us away from them:
  <i>i.e.</i>, if either "towards" or "away from" can have any meaning
  when applied to two realms which are absolutely severed from one
  another. Knowledge is always concerned with the relations between
  things; with their likeness, or unlikeness, their laws, or
  connections; but <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg285" id=
  "pg285">285</a></span> these are universals, and things are
  individuals. Science knows the laws of things, but not the things; it
  reveals how one object affects another, how it is connected with it;
  but what are the things themselves, which are connected, it does not
  know. The laws are mere forms of thought, "bloodless categories," and
  not facts. They may somehow be regarded as explaining facts, but they
  must not be identified with the facts. Knowledge is the sphere of
  man's thoughts, and is made up of ideas; real things are in another
  sphere, which man's thoughts cannot reach. We must distinguish more
  clearly than has hitherto been done, between logic as the science of
  knowledge, and metaphysics as a science which pretends to reveal the
  real nature of things. In a word, we can know thoughts or universals,
  but not things or particular existences. "When existence is in
  question it is the individual, not the universal, that is real; and
  the real individual is not a composite of species and accidents, but
  is individual to the inmost fibre of its being." Each object keeps
  its own real being to itself. Its inmost secret, its reality, is
  something that cannot appear in knowledge. We can only know its
  manifestations; but these manifestations are not its reality, nor
  connected with it. These belong to the sphere of knowledge, they are
  parts in a system of abstract thoughts; they do not exist in that
  system, or no-system, of individual realities, each of which, in its
  veritable being, is itself only, and connected with nought
  beside.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg286" id=
  "pg286">286</a></span>

  <p>Now, this view of the absolute impossibility of knowing any
  reality, on account of the fundamental difference between things and
  our thoughts about things, contains a better promise of a true view
  both of reality and of knowledge, than any of the previously
  mentioned half-hearted theories. It forces us explicitly either to
  regard every effort to know as futile, or else to regard it as futile
  <i>on this theory of it</i>. In other words, we must either give up
  knowledge or else give up the account of knowledge advanced by these
  philosophers. Hitherto, however, every philosophy that has set itself
  against the possibility of the knowledge of reality has had to give
  way. It has failed to shake the faith of mankind in its own
  intellectual endowment, or to arrest, even for a moment, the attempt
  by thinking to know things as they are. The view held by Berkeley,
  that knowledge is merely subjective, because the essence of things
  consists in their being perceived by the individual, and that they
  are nothing but his ideas, was refuted by Kant, when he showed that
  the very illusion of seeming knowledge was impossible on that theory.
  And this later view, which represents knowledge as merely subjective,
  on the ground that it is the product of the activity of the thought
  of mankind, working according to universal laws, is capable of being
  refuted in the same manner. The only difference between the
  Berkeleian and this modern speculative theory is that, on the former
  view, each individual constructed his own subjective entities
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg287" id="pg287">287</a></span> or
  illusions; while, on the latter, all men, by reason of the
  universality of the laws of thought governing their minds, create the
  same illusion, the same subjective scheme of ideas. Instead of each
  having his own private unreality, as the product of his perceiving
  activity, they have all the same, or at least a similar,
  phantom-world of ideas, as the result of their thinking. But, in both
  cases alike, the reality of the world without is out of reach, and
  knowledge is a purely subjective apprehension of a world within.
  Thoughts are quite different from things, and no effort of human
  reason can reveal any community between them.</p>

  <p>Now, there are certain difficulties which, so far as I know, those
  who hold this view have scarcely attempted to meet. The first of
  these lies in the obvious fact, that all men at all times consider
  that this very process of thinking, which the theory condemns as
  futile, is the only way we have of finding out what the reality of
  things is. Why do we reflect and think, except in order to pass
  beyond the illusions of sensuous appearances to the knowledge of
  things as they are? Nay, why do these philosophers themselves
  reflect, when reflection, instead of leading to truth, which is
  knowledge of reality, leads only to ideas, which, being universal,
  cannot represent the realities that are said to be "individual."</p>

  <p>The second is, that the knowledge of "the laws" of things gives to
  us practical command over them; although, according to this view,
  laws are not things, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg288" id=
  "pg288">288</a></span> nor any part of the reality of things, nor
  even true representations of things. Our authority over things seems
  to grow <i>pari passu</i> with our knowledge. The natural sciences
  seem to prove by their practical efficiency, that they are not
  building up a world of apparitions, like the real world; but
  gradually getting inside nature, learning more and more to wield her
  powers, and to make them the instruments of the purposes of man, and
  the means of his welfare. To common-sense,&mdash;which frequently
  "divines" truths that it cannot prove, and, like ballast in a ship,
  has often given steadiness to human progress although it is only a
  dead weight,&mdash;the assertion that man knows nothing is as
  incredible as that he knows all things. If it is replied, that the
  "things" which we seem to dominate by the means of knowledge are
  themselves only phenomena, the question arises, what then are the
  real things to which they are opposed? What right has any philosophy
  to say that there is any reality which no one can in any sense know?
  The knowledge that such reality is, is surely a relation between that
  reality and consciousness, and, if so, the assertion of an unknowable
  reality is self-contradictory. For the conception of it is the
  conception of something that is, and at the same time is not, out of
  relation to consciousness.</p>

  <p>To say what kind of thing reality is, is a still more remarkable
  feat, if reality is unknowable. Reality, being beyond knowledge, why
  is it called particular or individual, rather than universal?
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg289" id="pg289">289</a></span> How
  is it known that the true being of things is different from ideas?
  Surely both of the terms must be regarded as known to some extent, if
  they are called like or unlike, contrasted or compared, opposed or
  identified.</p>

  <p>But, lastly, this theory has to account for the fact that it
  constitutes what is not only unreal, but impossible, into the
  criterion of what is actual. If knowledge of reality is altogether
  different from human knowledge, how does it come to be its criterion?
  That knowledge is inadequate or imperfect can be known, only by
  contrasting it with its own proper ideal, whatever that may be. A
  criticism by reference to a foreign or irrelevant criterion, or the
  condemnation of a theory as imperfect because it does not realize an
  impossible end, is unreasonable. All true criticism of an object
  implies a reference to a more perfect state of itself.</p>

  <p>We must, then, regard the knowledge of objects as they are, which
  is opposed to human knowledge, as, only a completer and fuller form
  of that knowledge; or else we must cease to contrast it with our
  human knowledge, as valid with invalid, true with phenomenal. Either
  knowledge of reality is complete knowledge, or else it is a chimera.
  And, in either case, the sharp distinction between the real and the
  phenomenal vanishes; and what remains, is not a reality outside of
  consciousness, or different from ideas, but a reality related to
  consciousness, or, in other words, a knowable reality. "The
  distinction <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg290" id=
  "pg290">290</a></span> of objects into phenomena and noumena,
  <i>i.e.</i>, into things that for us exist, and things that for us do
  not exist, is an Irish bull in philosophy," said Heine. To speak of
  reality as unknowable, or to speak of anything as unknowable, is to
  utter a direct self-contradiction; it is to negate in the predicate
  what is asserted in the subject. It is a still more strange
  perversion to erect this knowable emptiness into a criterion of
  knowledge, and to call the latter phenomenal by reference to it.</p>

  <p>These difficulties are so fundamental and so obvious, that the
  theory of the phenomenal nature of human knowledge, which, being
  interpreted, means that we know nothing, could scarcely maintain its
  hold, were it not confused with another fact of human experience,
  that is apparently inconsistent with the doctrine that man can know
  the truth. Side by side with the faith of ordinary consciousness,
  that in order to know anything we must think, or, in other words,
  that knowledge shows us what things really are, there is a
  conviction, strengthened by constant experience, that we never know
  things fully. Every investigation into the nature of an object soon
  brings us to an enigma, a something more we do not know. Failing to
  know this something more, we generally consider that we have fallen
  short of reaching the reality of the object. We recognize, as it has
  been expressed, that we have been brought to a stand, and we
  therefore conclude that we are also brought to the end. We arrive at
  what we do not know, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg291" id=
  "pg291">291</a></span> and we pronounce that unknown to be
  unknowable; that is, we regard it as something different in nature
  from what we do know. So far as I can see, the attitude of ordinary
  thought in regard to this matter might be fairly represented by
  saying, that it always begins by considering objects as capable of
  being known in their reality, or as they are, and that experience
  always proves the attempt to know them as they are to be a failure.
  The effort is continued although failure is the result, and even
  although that failure be exaggerated and universalized into that
  despair of knowledge which we have described. We are thus confronted
  with what seems to be a contradiction; a trust and distrust in
  knowledge. It can only be solved by doing full justice to both of the
  conflicting elements; and then, if possible, by showing that they are
  elements, and not the complete, concrete fact, except when held
  together.</p>

  <p>From one point of view, it is undeniable that in every object of
  perception, we come upon problems that we cannot solve. Science at
  its best, and even when dealing with the simplest of things, is
  forced to stop short of its final secret. Even when it has discovered
  its law, there is still apparently something over and above which
  science cannot grasp, and which seems to give to the object its
  reality. All the natural sciences concentrated on a bit of iron ore
  fail to exhaust the truth in it: there is always a "beyond" in it,
  something still more fundamental which is not yet understood.
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg292" id="pg292">292</a></span> And
  that something beyond, that inner essence, that point in which the
  laws meet and which the sciences fail to lift into knowledge, is
  regarded as just the reality of the thing. Thus the reality is
  supposed, at the close of every investigation, to lie outside of
  knowledge; and conversely, all that we do know, seeing that it lacks
  this last element, seems to be only apparent knowledge, or knowledge
  of phenomena.</p>

  <p>In this way the process of knowing seems always to stop short at
  the critical moment, when the truth is just about to be reached. And
  those who dwell on this aspect alone are apt to conclude that man's
  intellect is touched with a kind of impotence, which makes it useless
  when it gets near the reality. It is like a weapon that snaps at the
  hilt just when the battle is hottest. For we seem to be able to know
  everything but the reality, and yet apart from the real essence all
  knowledge seems to be merely apparent. Physical science penetrates
  through the outer appearances of things to their laws, analyzes them
  into forms of energy, calculates their action and predicts their
  effects with certainty. Its practical power over the forces of nature
  is so great that it seems to have got inside her secrets. And yet
  science will itself acknowledge that in every simplest object there
  is an unknown. Its triumphant course of explaining seems to be always
  arrested at the threshold of reality. It has no theory, scarcely an
  hypothesis, of the actual nature of things, or of what that is in
  each object, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg293" id=
  "pg293">293</a></span> which constitutes it a real existence. Natural
  science, with a scarcely concealed sneer, hands over to the
  metaphysician all questions as to the real being of things; and
  itself makes the more modest pretension of showing how things behave,
  not what they are; what effects follow the original noumenal causes,
  but not the veritable nature of these causes. Nor can the
  metaphysician, in his turn, do more than suggest a hypothesis as to
  the nature of the ultimate reality in things. He cannot detect or
  demonstrate it in any particular fact. In a word, every minutest
  object in the world baffles the combined powers of all forms of human
  thought, and holds back its essence or true being from them. And as
  long as this true being, or reality is not known, the knowledge which
  we seem to have cannot be held as ultimately true, but is
  demonstrably a makeshift.</p>

  <p>Having made this confession, there seems to be no alternative but
  to postulate an utter discrepancy between human thought and real
  existence, or between human knowledge and truth, which is the
  correspondence of thing and thought. For, at no point is knowledge
  found to be in touch with real being; it is everywhere demonstrably
  conditioned and relative, and inadequate to express the true reality
  of its objects. What remains, then, except to regard human knowledge
  as completely untrustworthy, as merely of phenomena? If we cannot
  know <i>any</i> reality, does not knowledge completely
  fail?</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg294" id=
  "pg294">294</a></span>

  <p>Now, in dealing with the moral life of man, we saw that the method
  of hard alternatives is invalid. The moral life, being progressive,
  was shown to be the meeting&mdash;point of the ideal and the actual;
  and the ideal of perfect goodness was regarded as manifesting itself
  in actions which, nevertheless, were never adequate to express it.
  The good when achieved was ever condemned as unworthy, and the ideal
  when attained ever pressed for more adequate expression in a better
  character. The ideal was present as potency, as realizing itself, but
  it was never completely realized. The absolute good was never reached
  in the best action, and never completely missed in the worst.</p>

  <p>The same conflict of real and unreal was shown to be essential to
  every natural life. As long as anything grows it neither completely
  attains, nor completely falls away from its ideal. The growing acorn
  is not an oak tree, and yet it is not a mere acorn. The child is not
  the man; and yet the man is in the child, and only needs to be
  evolved by interaction with circumstances. The process of growth is
  one wherein the ideal is always present, as a reconstructive power
  gradually changing its whole vehicle, or organism, into a more
  perfect expression of itself. The ideal is reached in the end, just
  because it is present in the beginning; and there is no end as long
  as growth continues.</p>

  <p>Now, it is evident that knowledge, whether it be that of the
  individual man or of the human race, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg295" id="pg295">295</a></span> is a thing that grows. The process
  by means of which natural science makes progress, or by which the
  consciousness of the child expands and deepens into the consciousness
  of the man, is best made intelligible from the point of view of
  evolution. It is like an organic process, in which each new
  acquirement finds its place in an old order, each new fact is brought
  under the permanent principles of experience, and absorbed into an
  intellectual life, which itself, in turn, grows richer and fuller
  with every new acquisition. No knowledge worthy of the name is an
  aggregation of facts. Wisdom comes by growth.</p>

  <p>Hence, the assertion that knowledge never attains reality, does
  not imply that it always misses it. In morals we do not say that a
  man is entirely evil, although he never, even in his best actions,
  attains the true good. And if the process of knowing is one that
  presses onward towards an ideal, that ideal is never completely
  missed even in the poorest knowledge. If it grows, the method of
  fixed alternatives must be inapplicable to it. The ideal, whatever it
  may be, must be considered as active in the present, guiding the
  whole movement, and gradually manifesting itself in each of the
  passing forms, which are used up as the raw material of new
  acquirement; and yet no passing form completely expresses the
  ideal.</p>

  <p>Nor is it difficult to say what that ideal of knowlege is,
  although we cannot define it in any adequate manner. We know that the
  end of morality is the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg296" id=
  "pg296">296</a></span> <i>summum bonum</i>, although we cannot, as
  long as we are progressive, define its whole content, or find it
  fully realized in any action. Every failure brings new truth, every
  higher grade of moral character reveals some new height of goodness
  to be scaled; the moral ideal acquires definiteness and content as
  humanity moves upwards. And yet the ideal is not entirely unknown
  even at the first; even to the most ignorant, it presents itself as a
  criterion which enables him to distinguish between right and wrong,
  evil and goodness, and which guides his practical life. The same
  truth holds with regard to knowledge. Its growth receives its impulse
  from, and is directed and determined by, what is conceived as the
  real world of facts. This truth, namely, that the ideal knowledge is
  knowledge of reality, the most subjective philosopher cannot but
  acknowledge. It is implied in his condemnation of knowledge as merely
  phenomenal, that there is possible a knowledge of real being. That
  thought and reality can be brought together, or rather, that they are
  always together, is presupposed in all knowledge and in all
  experience. The effort to know is the effort to <i>explain</i> the
  relation of thought and reality, not to create it. The ideal of
  perfect knowledge is present from the first; it generates the effort,
  directs it, distinguishes between truth and error. And that which man
  ever aims at, whether in the ordinary activities of daily thought, or
  through the patient labour of scientific investigation, or in the
  reflective self-torture of philosophic thought, is to <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg297" id="pg297">297</a></span> know the world as
  it is. No failure damps the ardour of this endeavour. Relativists,
  phenomenalists, agnostics, sceptics, Kantians or
  Neo-Kantians&mdash;all the crowd of thinkers who cry down the human
  intellect, and draw a charmed circle around reality so as to make it
  unapproachable to the mind of man&mdash;ply this useless labour. They
  are seeking to penetrate beneath the shows of sense and the outer
  husk of phenomena to the truth, which is the meeting-point of
  knowledge and reality; they are endeavouring to translate into an
  intellectual possession the powers that play within and around them;
  or, in other words, to make these powers express themselves in their
  thoughts, and supply the content of their spiritual life. The irony,
  latent in their endeavour, gives them no pause; they are in some way
  content to pursue what they call phantoms, and to try to satisfy
  their thirst with the waters of a mirage. This comes from the
  presence of the ideal within them, that is, of the implicit unity of
  reality and thought, which seeks for explicit and complete
  manifestation in knowledge. The reality is present in them as
  thinking activity, working towards complete revelation of itself by
  means of knowledge. And its presence is real, although the process is
  never complete.</p>

  <p>In knowledge, as in morals, it is necessary to remember both of
  the truths implied in the pursuit of an ideal&mdash;that a growing
  thing not only always fails to attain, but also always succeeds. The
  distinction between truth and error in knowledge is <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg298" id="pg298">298</a></span> present at every
  stage in the effort to attain truth, as the distinction between right
  and wrong is present in every phase of the moral life. It is the
  source of the intellectual effort. But that distinction cannot be
  drawn except by reference to a criterion of truth, which condemns our
  actual knowledge; as it is the absolute good, which condemns the
  present character. The ideal may be indefinite, and its content
  confused and poor; but it is always sufficient for its purpose,
  always better than the actual achievement. And, in this sense,
  reality, the truth, the veritable being of things, is always reached
  by the poorest knowledge. As there is no starved and distorted
  sapling which is not the embodiment of the principle of natural life,
  so the meanest character is the product of an ideal of goodness, and
  the most confused opinion of ignorant mankind is an expression of the
  reality of things. Without it there would not be even the semblance
  of knowledge, not even error and untruth.</p>

  <p>Those who, like Browning, make a division between man's thought
  and real things, and regard the sphere of knowledge as touching at no
  point the sphere of actual existence, are attributing to the bare
  human intellect much more power than it has. They regard mind as
  creating its phenomenal knowledge, or the apparent world. For, having
  separated mind from reality, it is evident that they cannot avail
  themselves of any doctrine of sensations or impressions as a medium
  between them, or postulate any other form of connection <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg299" id="pg299">299</a></span> or means of
  communication. Connection of any kind must, in the end, imply some
  community of nature, and must put the unity of thought and
  being&mdash;here denied&mdash;beneath their difference. Hence, the
  world of phenomena which we know, and which as known, does not seem
  to consist of realities, must be the product of the unaided human
  mind. The intellect, isolated from all real being, has manufactured
  the apparent universe, in all its endless wealth. It is a creative
  intellect, although it can only create illusions. It evolves all its
  products from itself.</p>

  <p>But thought, set to revolve upon its own axis in an empty region,
  can produce nothing, not even illusions. And, indeed, those who deny
  that it is possible for thought and reality to meet in a unity, have,
  notwithstanding, to bring over "something" to the aid of thought.
  There must be some effluence from the world of reality, some
  manifestations of the thing (though they are not the reality of the
  thing, nor any part of the reality, nor connected with the reality!)
  to assist the mind and supply it with data. The "phenomenal world" is
  a hybrid, generated by thought and "something"&mdash;which yet is not
  reality; for the real world is a world of things in themselves,
  altogether beyond thought. By bringing in these data, it is virtually
  admitted that the human mind reaches down into itself in vain for a
  world, even for a phenomenal one.</p>

  <p>Thought apart from things is quite empty, just as things apart
  from thought are blind. Such thought <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg300" id="pg300">300</a></span> and such reality are mere
  abstractions, hypostasized by false metaphysics; they are elements of
  truth rent asunder, and destroyed in the rending. The dependence of
  the intelligence of man upon reality is direct and complete. The
  foolishest dream, that ever played out its panorama beneath a
  night-cap, came through the gates of the senses from the actual
  world. Man is limited to his material in all that he knows, just as
  he is ruled by the laws of thought. He cannot go one step beyond it.
  To transcend "experience" is impossible. We have no wings to sustain
  us in an empty region, and no need of any. It is as impossible for
  man to create new ideas, as it is for him to create new atoms. Our
  thought is essentially connected with reality. There is no <i>mauvais
  pas</i> from thought to things. We do not need to leap out of
  ourselves in order to get into the world. We are in it from the
  first, both as physical and moral agents, and as thinking beings. Our
  thoughts are expressions of the real nature of things, so far as they
  go. They may be and are imperfect; they may be and are confused and
  inadequate, and express only the superficial aspects and not "the
  inmost fibres"; still, they are what they are, in virtue of "the
  reality," which finds itself interpreted in them. Severed from that
  reality, they would be nothing.</p>

  <p>Thus, the distinction between thought and reality is a distinction
  within a deeper unity. And that unity must not be regarded as
  something additional to both, or as a third something. It <i>is</i>
  their unity. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg301" id=
  "pg301">301</a></span> It is both reality and thought: it is existing
  thought, or reality knowing itself and existing through its knowledge
  of self; it is self-consciousness. The distinguished elements have no
  existence or meaning except in their unity. Like the actual and
  ideal, they have significance and being, only in their reference to
  each other.</p>

  <p>There is one more difficulty connected with this matter which I
  must touch upon, although the discussion may already be regarded as
  prolix. It is acknowledged by every one that the knowledge of the
  individual, and his apparent world of realities, grow <i>pari
  passu</i>. Beyond his sphere of knowledge there is no reality <i>for
  him</i>, not even apparent reality. But, on the other hand, the real
  world of existing things exists all the same whether he knows it or
  not. It did not begin to be with any knowledge he may have of it, it
  does not cease to be with his extinction, and it is not in any way
  affected by his valid, or invalid, reconstruction of it in thought.
  The world which depends on his thought is his world, and not the
  world of really existing things. And this is true alike of every
  individual. The world is independent of all human minds. It existed
  before them, and will, very possibly, exist after them. Can we not,
  therefore, conclude that the real world is independent of thought,
  and that it exists without relation to it?</p>

  <p>A short reference to the moral consciousness may suggest the
  answer to this difficulty. In morality (as also is the case in
  knowledge) the moral ideal, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg302" id=
  "pg302">302</a></span> or the objective law of goodness, grows in
  richness and fulness of content with the individual who apprehends
  it. <i>His</i> moral world is the counterpart of <i>his</i> moral
  growth as a character. Goodness <i>for him</i> directly depends upon
  his recognition of it. Animals, presumably, have no moral ideal,
  because they have not the power to constitute it. In morals, as in
  knowledge, the mind of man constructs its own world. And yet, in both
  alike, the world of truth or of goodness exists all the same whether
  the individual knows it or not. He does not call the moral law into
  being, but finds it without, and then realizes it in his own life.
  The moral law does not vanish and reappear with its recognition by
  mankind. It is not subject to the chances and changes of its life,
  but a good in itself that is eternal.</p>

  <p>Is it therefore independent of all intelligence? Can goodness be
  anything but the law of a self-conscious being? Is it the quality or
  motive or ideal of a mere thing? Manifestly not. Its relation to
  self-consciousness is essential. With the extinction of
  self-consciousness all moral goodness is extinguished.</p>

  <p>The same holds true of reality. The question of the reality or
  unreality of things cannot arise except in an intelligence. Animals
  have neither illusions nor truths&mdash;unless they are
  self-conscious. The reality, which man sets over against his own
  inadequate knowledge, is posited by him; and it has no meaning
  whatsoever except in this contrast. And to endeavour to conceive a
  reality which no one knows, is to assert a relative term without its
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg303" id="pg303">303</a></span>
  correlative, which is absurd; it is to posit an ideal which is
  opposed to nothing actual.</p>

  <p>In this view, so commonly held in our day, that knowledge is
  subjective and reality unknowable, we have another example of the
  falseness and inconsistency of abstract thinking. If this error be
  committed, there is no fundamental gain in saying with Kant, that
  things are relative to the thought of all, instead of asserting, with
  Berkeley or Browning, that they are relative to the thought of each.
  The final result is the same. Things as known, are reduced into mere
  creations of thought; things as they are, are regarded as not
  thoughts, and as partaking in no way of the nature of thought. And
  yet "reality" is virtually assumed to be given at the beginning of
  knowledge; for the sensations are supposed to be emanations from it,
  or roused in consciousness by it. These sensations, it is said, man
  does not make, but receives, and receives from the concealed reality.
  They flow from it, and are the manifestations of its activity. Then,
  in the next moment, reality is regarded as not given in any way, but
  as something to be discovered by the effort of thought; for we always
  strive to know things, and not phantoms. Lastly, the knowledge thus
  acquired being regarded as imperfect, and experience showing to us
  continually that every object has more in it than we know, the
  reality is pronounced to be unknowable, and all knowledge is regarded
  as failure, as acquaintance with mere phantoms. Thus, in thought, as
  in morality, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg304" id=
  "pg304">304</a></span> ideal is present at the beginning, it is an
  effort after explicit realization, and its process is never
  complete.</p>

  <p>Now, all these aspects of the ideal of knowledge, that is, of
  reality, are held by the unsophisticated intelligence of man; and
  abstract philosophy is not capable of finally getting rid of any one
  of them. It, too, holds them <i>alternately</i>. Its denial of the
  possibility of knowing reality is refuted by its own starting-point;
  for it begins with a given something, regarded as real, and its very
  effort to know is an attempt to know that reality by thinking. But it
  forgets these facts, when it is discovered that knowledge at the best
  is incomplete. It is thus tossed from assertion to denial, and from
  denial to assertion; from one abstract or one-sided view of reality,
  to the other.</p>

  <p>When these different aspects of truth are grasped together from
  the point of view of evolution, there seems to be a way of escaping
  the difficulties to which they give rise. For the ideal must be
  present at the beginning, and cannot be present in its fulness till
  the process is complete. What is here required is to lift our theory
  of man's knowledge to the level of our theory of his moral life, and
  to treat it frankly as the process whereby reality manifests itself
  in the mind of man. In that way, we shall avoid the absurdities of
  both of the abstract schools of philosophy, to both of which alike
  the native intelligence of man gives the lie. We shall say neither
  that man knows nothing, nor that he knows all; we shall regard his
  knowledge, neither as purely <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg305"
  id="pg305">305</a></span> phenomenal and out of all contact with
  reality, nor as an actual identification with the real being of
  things in all their complex variety. For, in morality, we do not say
  either that the individual is absolutely evil, because his actions
  never realize the supreme ideal of goodness; nor, that he is at the
  last term of development, and "taking the place of God," because he
  lives as "ever in his great Taskmaster's eye." Just as every moral
  action, however good, leaves something still to be desiderated,
  something that may become a stepping-stone for new movement towards
  the ideal which it has failed to actualize; so all our knowledge of
  an object leaves something over that we have not apprehended, which
  is truer and more real than anything we know, and which in all future
  effort we strive to master. And, just as the very effort, to be good
  derives its impulse and direction from the ideal of goodness which is
  present, and striving for realization; so the effort to know derives
  its impulse and direction from the reality which is present, and
  striving for complete realization in the thought of man. We know
  reality confusedly from the first; and it is because we have attained
  so much knowledge, that we strive for greater clearness and fulness.
  It is by planting his foot on the world that man travels. It is by
  opposing his power to the given reality that his knowledge grows.</p>

  <p>When once we recognize that reality is the ideal of knowledge, we
  are able to acknowledge all the truth that is in the doctrine of the
  phenomenalists, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg306" id=
  "pg306">306</a></span> without falling into their errors and
  contradictions. We may go as far as the poet in confessing
  intellectual impotence, and roundly call the knowledge of man
  "lacquered ignorance." "Earth's least atom" does veritably remain an
  enigma. Man is actually flung back into his circumscribed sphere by
  every fact; and he will continue to be so flung to the end of time.
  He will never know reality, nor be able to hold up in his hand the
  very heart of the simplest thing in the world. For the world is an
  organic totality, and its simplest thing will not be seen, through
  and through, till everything is known, till every fact and event is
  related to every other under principles which are universal: just as
  goodness cannot be fully achieved in any act, till the agent is in
  all ways lifted to the level of absolute goodness. Physics cannot
  reveal the forces which keep a stone in its place on the earth, till
  it has traced the forces that maintain the starry systems in their
  course. No fact can be thoroughly known, <i>i.e.</i>, known in its
  reality, till the light of the universe has been focussed upon it:
  and, on the other hand, to know any subject through and through would
  be to explain all being. The highest law and the essence of the
  simple fact, the universal and the particular, can only be known
  together, in and through one another. "Reality" in "the least atom"
  will be known, only when knowledge has completed its work, and the
  universe has become a transparent sphere, penetrated in every
  direction by the shafts of intelligence.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg307" id="pg307">307</a></span>

  <p>But this is only half the truth. If knowledge is never complete,
  it is always <i>completing</i>; if reality is never known, it is ever
  <i>being known</i>; if the ideal is never actual, it is always
  <i>being actualized</i>. The complete failure of knowledge is as
  impossible as its complete success. It is at no time severed from
  reality; it is never its mere adumbration, nor are its contents mere
  phenomena. On the contrary, it is reality partially revealed, the
  ideal incompletely actualized. Our very errors are the working of
  reality within us, and apart from it they would be impossible. The
  process towards truth by man is the process of truth <i>in</i> man;
  the movement of knowledge towards reality is the movement of reality
  into knowledge. A purely subjective consciousness which knows, such
  as the poet tried to describe, is a self-contradiction: it would be a
  consciousness at once related, and not related, to the actual world.
  But man has no need to relate himself to the world. He is already
  related, and his task is to understand that relation, or, in other
  words, to make both its terms intelligible. Man has no need to go out
  from himself to facts; his relation to facts is prior to his
  distinction from them. The truth is that he cannot entirely lift
  himself away from them, nor suspend his thoughts in the void. In his
  inmost being he is creation's voice, and in his knowledge he
  confusedly murmurs its deep thoughts.</p>

  <p>Browning was aware of this truth in its application to man's moral
  nature. In speaking of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg308" id=
  "pg308">308</a></span> principle of love, he was not tempted to apply
  fixed alternatives. On the contrary, he detected in the "poorest love
  that was ever offered" the veritable presence of that which is
  perfect and complete, though never completely actualized. His
  interest in the moral development of man, and his penetrative moral
  insight, acting upon, and guided by the truths of the Christian
  religion, warned him, on this side, against the absolute separation
  of the ideal and actual, the divine and human. Human love, however
  poor in quality and limited in range, was to him God's love in man.
  It was a wave breaking in the individual of that First Love, which is
  ever flowing back through the life of humanity to its primal source.
  To him all moral endeavour is the process of this Primal Love; and
  every man, as he consciously identifies himself with it, may use the
  language of Scripture, and say, "It is not I that live, but Christ
  lives in me."</p>

  <p>But, on the side of knowledge, he was neither so deeply
  interested, nor had he so good a guide to lean upon. Ignorant,
  according to all appearances, of the philosophy which has made the
  Christian maxim, "Die to live,"&mdash;which primarily is only a
  principle of morality&mdash;the basis of its theory of knowledge, he
  exaggerated the failure of science to reach the whole truth as to any
  particular object, into a qualitative discrepancy between knowledge
  and truth. Because knowledge is never complete, it is always mere
  lacquered ignorance; and man's apparent intellectual victories are
  only <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg309" id="pg309">309</a></span>
  conquests in a land of unrealities, or mere phenomena. He occupies in
  regard to knowledge, a position strictly analogous to that of
  Carlyle, in regard to morality; his intellectual pessimism is the
  counterpart of the moral pessimism of his predecessor, and it springs
  from the same error. He forgot that the ideal without is also the
  power within, which makes for its own manifestation in the mind of
  man.</p>

  <p>He opposed the intellect to the world, as Carlyle opposed the
  weakness of man to the law of duty; and he neglected the fact that
  the world was there for him, only because he knew it, just as Carlyle
  neglected the fact that the duty was without, only because it was
  recognized within. He strained the difference between the ideal and
  actual into an absolute distinction; and, as Carlyle condemned man to
  strive for a goodness which he could never achieve, so Browning
  condemns him to pursue a truth which he can never attain. In both,
  the failure is regarded as absolute. "There is no good in us," has
  for its counterpart "There is no truth in us." Both the moralist and
  the poet dwell on the <i>negative</i> relation of the ideal and
  actual, and forget that the negative has no meaning, except as the
  expression of a deeper affirmative. Carlyle had to learn that we know
  our moral imperfection, only because we are conscious of a better
  within us; and Browning had to learn that we are aware of our
  ignorance, only because we have the consciousness of fuller truth
  with which we contrast <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg310" id=
  "pg310">310</a></span> our knowledge. Browning, indeed, knew that the
  consciousness of evil was itself evidence of the presence of good,
  that perfection means death, and progress is life, on the side of
  morals; but he has missed the corresponding truth on the side of
  knowledge. If he acknowledges that the highest revealed itself to
  man, on the practical side, as love; he does not see that it has also
  manifested itself to man, on the theoretical side, as reason. The
  self-communication of the Infinite is incomplete love is a quality of
  God, intelligence a quality of man; hence, on one side, there is no
  limit to achievement, but on the other there is impotence. Human
  nature is absolutely divided against itself; and the division, as we
  have already seen, is not between flesh and spirit, but between a
  love which is God's own and perfect, and an intelligence which is
  merely man's and altogether weak and deceptive.</p>

  <p>This is what makes Browning think it impossible to re-establish
  faith in God, except by turning his back on knowledge; but whether it
  is possible for him to appeal to the moral consciousness, we shall
  inquire in the next chapter.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg311"

    <p>A: Milton's <i>Areopagitica</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It has been shown that Browning appeals, in defence of his
  optimistic faith, from the intellect to the heart. His theory rests
  on three main assumptions:&mdash;namely (1) that knowledge of the
  true nature of things is impossible to man, and that, therefore, it
  is necessary to find other and better evidence than the intellect can
  give for the victory of good over evil; (2) that the failure of
  knowledge is a necessary condition of the moral life, inasmuch as
  certain knowledge would render all moral effort either futile or
  needless; (3) that after the failure of knowledge there still remains
  possible a faith of the heart, which can furnish a sufficient
  objective basis to morality and religion. The first of these
  assumptions I endeavoured to deal with in the last chapter. I now
  turn to the remaining two.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg312"
  id="pg312">312</a></span>

  <p>Demonstrative, or certain, or absolute knowledge of the actual
  nature of things would, Browning asserts, destroy the very
  possibility of a moral life.<sup>A</sup> For such knowledge would show either
  that evil is evil, or that evil is good; and, in both cases alike,
  the benevolent activity of love would be futile. In the first case,
  it would be thwarted and arrested by despair; for, if evil be evil,
  it must remain evil for aught that man can do. Man cannot effect a
  change in the nature of things, nor create a good in a world
  dominated by evil. In the second case, the saving effect of moral
  love would be unnecessary; for, if evil be only seeming, then all
  things are perfect and complete, and there is no need of
  interference. It is necessary, therefore, that man should be in a
  permanent state of doubt as to the real existence of evil; and,
  whether evil does exist or not, it must seem, and only seem to exist
  to man, in order that he may devote himself to the service of
  good.<sup>B</sup></p>

  </div>

  <p>Now, if this view of the poet be taken in the strict sense in
  which he uses it in this argument, it admits of a very easy
  refutation. It takes us beyond the bounds of all possible human
  experience, into an imaginary region, as to which all assertions are
  equally valueless. It is impossible to conceive how the conduct of a
  being who is moral would be affected by absolute knowledge; or,
  indeed, to conceive the existence of such a being. For morality, as
  the poet insists, is a process in which <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg313" id="pg313">313</a></span> an ideal is
  gradually realized through conflict with the actual&mdash;an actual
  which it both produces and transmutes at every stage of the progress.
  But complete knowledge would be above all process. Hence we would
  have, on Browning's hypothesis, to conceive of a being in whom
  perfect knowledge was combined with an undeveloped will. A being so
  constituted would be an agglomerate of utterly disparate elements,
  the interaction of which in a single character it would be impossible
  to make intelligible.</p>

  <p>But, setting aside this point, there is a curious flaw in
  Browning's argument, which indicates that he had not distinguished
  between two forms of optimism which are essentially different from
  each other,&mdash;namely, the pantheistic and the Christian.</p>

  <p>To know that evil is only apparent, that pain is only pleasure's
  mask, that all forms of wickedness and misery are only illusions of
  an incomplete intelligence, would, he argues, arrest all moral action
  and stultify love. For love&mdash;which necessarily implies need in
  its object&mdash;is the principle of all right action. In this he
  argues justly, for the moral life is essentially a conflict and
  progress; and, in a world in which "white ruled unchecked along the
  line," there would be neither the need of conflict nor the
  possibility of progress. And, on the other hand, if the good were
  merely a phantom, and evil the reality, the same destruction of moral
  activity would follow. "White may not triumph," in this absolute
  manner, nor may we "clean abolish, once <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg314" id="pg314">314</a></span> and evermore,
  white's faintest trace." There must be "the constant shade cast on
  life's shine."</p>

  <p>All this is true; but the admission of it in no way militates
  against the conception of absolutely valid knowledge; nor is it any
  proof that we need live in the twilight of perpetual doubt, in order
  to be moral. For the knowledge, of which Browning speaks, would be
  knowledge of a state of things in which morality would be really
  impossible; that is, it would be knowledge of a world in which all
  was evil or all was good. On the other hand, valid knowledge of a
  world in which good and evil are in conflict, and in which the former
  is realized through victory over the latter, would not destroy
  morality. What is inconsistent with the moral life is the conception
  of a world where there is no movement from evil to good, no evolution
  of character, but merely the stand-still life of "Rephan." But
  absolutely certain knowledge that the good is at issue with sin in
  the world, that there is no way of attaining goodness except through
  conflict with evil, and that moral life, as the poet so frequently
  insists, is a process which converts all actual attainment into a
  dead self, from which we can rise to higher things&mdash;a self,
  therefore, which is relatively evil&mdash;would, and does, inspire
  morality. It is the deification of evil not negated or overcome, of
  evil as it is in itself and apart from all process, which destroys
  morality. And the same is equally true of a pantheistic optimism,
  which asserts that all things <i>are</i> good. But it is not true
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg315" id="pg315">315</a></span> of a
  Christian optimism, which asserts that all things are <i>working
  together for</i> good. For such optimism implies that the process of
  negating or overcoming evil is essential to the attainment of
  goodness; it does not imply that evil, as evil, is ever good. Evil is
  unreal, only in the sense that it cannot withstand the power which is
  set against it. It is not <i>mere</i> semblance, a mere negation or
  absence of being; it is opposed to the good, and its opposition can
  be overcome, only by the moral effort which it calls forth. An
  optimistic faith of this kind can find room for morality; and,
  indeed, it furnishes it with the religious basis it needs. Browning,
  however, has confused these two forms of optimism; and, therefore, he
  has been driven to condemn knowledge, because he knew no alternative
  but that of either making evil eternally real, or making it
  absolutely unreal. A third alternative, however, is supplied by the
  conception of moral evolution. Knowledge of the conditions on which
  good can be attained&mdash;a knowledge that amounts to
  conviction&mdash;is the spring of all moral effort; whereas an
  attitude of permanent doubt as to the distinction between good and
  evil would paralyse it. Such a doubt must be solved before man can
  act at all, or choose one end rather than another. All action implies
  belief, and the ardour and vigour of moral action can only come from
  a belief which is whole-hearted.</p>

  <p>The further assertion, which the poet makes in <i>La Saisiaz</i>,
  and repeats elsewhere, that sure knowledge <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg316" id="pg316">316</a></span> of the
  consequences that follow good and evil actions would necessarily lead
  to the choice of good and the avoidance of evil, and destroy morality
  by destroying liberty of choice, raises the whole question of the
  relation of knowledge and conduct, and cannot be adequately discussed
  here. It may be said, however, that it rests upon a confusion between
  two forms of necessity: namely, natural and spiritual necessity. In
  asserting that knowledge of the consequences of evil would determine
  human action in a necessary way, the poet virtually treats man as if
  he were a natural being. But the assumption that man is responsible
  and liable to punishment, involves that he is capable of withstanding
  all such determination. And knowledge does not and cannot lead to
  such necessary determination. Reason brings freedom; for reason
  constitutes the ends of action.</p>

  <p>It is the constant desire of the good to attain to such a
  convincing knowledge of the worth and dignity of the moral law that
  they shall be able to make themselves its devoted instruments. Their
  desire is that "the good" shall supplant in them all motives that
  conflict against it, and be the inner principle, or necessity, of all
  their actions. Such complete devotion to the good is expressed, for
  instance, in the words of the Hebrew Psalmist: "Thy testimonies have
  I taken as an heritage for ever; for they are the rejoicing of my
  heart. I have inclined mine heart to perform Thy statutes alway, even
  unto the end. I hate vain thoughts, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg317" id="pg317">317</a></span> but Thy law do I love."
  "Nevertheless I live," said the Christian apostle, "yet not I, but
  Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I
  live by the faith of the Son of God." In these words there is
  expressed that highest form of the moral life, in which the
  individual is so identified in desire with his ideal, that he lives
  only to actualize it in his character. The natural self is
  represented as dead, and the victory of the new principle is viewed
  as complete. This full obedience to the ideal is the service of a
  necessity; but the necessity is within, and the service is,
  therefore, perfect freedom. The authority of the law is absolute, but
  the law is self-imposed. The whole man is convinced of its goodness.
  He has acquired something even fuller than a mere intellectual
  demonstration of it; for his knowledge has ripened into wisdom,
  possessed his sympathies, and become a disposition of his heart. And
  the fulness and certainty of his knowledge, so far from rendering
  morality impossible, is its very perfection. To bring about such a
  knowledge of the good of goodness and the evil of evil, as will
  engender love of the former and hatred of the latter, is the aim of
  all moral education. Thus, the history of human life, in so far as it
  is progressive, may be concentrated in the saying that it is the
  ascent from the power of a necessity which is natural, to the power
  of a necessity which is moral. And this latter necessity can come
  only through fuller and more convincing knowledge of the law that
  rules the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg318" id=
  "pg318">318</a></span> world, and is also the inner principle of
  man's nature.</p>

  <p>There remains now the third element in Browning's
  view,&mdash;namely, that the faith in the good, implied in morality
  and religion, can be firmly established, after knowledge has turned
  out deceptive, upon the individual's consciousness of the power of
  love within himself. In other words, I must now try to estimate the
  value of Browning's appeal from the intellect to the heart.</p>

  <p>Before doing so, however, it may be well to repeat once more that
  Browning's condemnation of knowledge, in his philosophical poems, is
  not partial or hesitating. On the contrary, he confines it definitely
  to the individual's consciousness of his own inner states.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i4">"Myself I solely recognize.</p>

    <p>They, too, may recognize themselves, not me,</p>

    <p>For aught I know or care."<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>A Bean-Stripe</i>. See also <i>La Saisiaz</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Nor does Browning endeavour to correct this limited testimony of
  the intellect as to its own states, by bringing in the miraculous aid
  of revelation, or by postulating an unerring moral faculty. He does
  not assume an intuitive power of knowing right from wrong; but he
  maintains that ignorance enwraps man's moral sense.<sup>B</sup></p>

  <p>God's ways are past finding out. Nay, God Himself is unknown. At
  times, indeed, the power to love within man seems to the poet to be a

  in this surpassing emotion of the human heart. But, when
  philosophizing, he withdraws even this amount of knowledge. He is</p>

  <p>Thus&mdash;to sum up Browning's view of knowledge&mdash;we are
  ignorant of the world; we do not know even whether it is good, or
  evil, or only their semblance, that is presented to us in human life;
  and we know nothing of God, except that He is the cause of love in
  man. What greater depth of agnosticism is possible?</p>

  <p>When the doctrine is put in this bald form, the moral and
  religious consciousness of man, on behalf of which the theory was
  invented, revolts against it. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg320"
  id="pg320">320</a></span> Nevertheless, the distinction made by
  Browning between the intellectual and emotional elements of human
  life is very common in religious thought. It is not often, indeed,
  that either the worth of love, or the weakness of knowledge receives
  such emphatic expression as that which is given to them by the poet;
  but the same general idea of their relation is often expressed, and
  still more often implied. Browning differs from our ordinary teachers
  mainly in the boldness of his affirmatives and negatives. They, too,
  regard the intellect as merely human, and the emotion of love as
  divine. They, too, shrink from identifying the reason of man with the
  reason of God; even though they may recognize that morality and
  religion must postulate some kind of unity between God and man. They,
  too, conceive that human knowledge differs <i>in nature</i> from that
  of God, while they maintain that human goodness is the same in nature
  with that of God, though different in degree and fulness. There are
  two <i>kinds</i> of knowledge, but there is only one kind of justice,
  or mercy, or loving-kindness. Man must be content with a semblance of
  a knowledge of truth; but a semblance of goodness, would be
  intolerable. God really reveals Himself to man in morality and
  religion, and He communicates to man nothing less than "the divine
  love." But there is no such close connection on the side of reason.
  The religious life of man is a divine principle, the indwelling of
  God in him; but there is a final and fatal defect in man's knowledge.
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg321" id="pg321">321</a></span> The
  divine love's manifestation of itself is ever incomplete, it is true,
  even in the best of men; but there is no defect in its nature.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of this doctrine, few religious opinions are more
  common at the present day, than that it is necessary to appeal, on
  all the high concerns of man's moral and religious life, from the
  intellect to the heart. Where we cannot know, we may still feel; and
  the religious man may have, in his own feeling of the divine, a more
  intimate conviction of the reality of that in which he trusts, than
  could be produced by any intellectual process.</p>

  <p>What, then, I have now to ask, is the meaning and value of this
  appeal to emotion? Can love, or emotion in any of its forms, reveal
  truths to man which his intellect cannot discover? If so, how? If
  not, how shall we account for the general conviction of good men that
  it can? We have, in a word, either to justify the appeal to the
  heart, by explaining how the heart may utter truths that are hidden
  from reason; or else to account for the illusion, by which religious
  emotion seems to reveal such truths.</p>

  <p>The first requirement is shown to be unreasonable by the very
  terms in which it is made. The intuitive insight of faith, the
  immediate conviction of the heart, cannot render, and must not try to
  render, any account of itself. Proof is a process; but there is no
  process in this direct conviction of truth. Its assertion is just the
  denial of process; it is a repudiation of all connections; in such a
  faith of feeling there are no cob-web lines relating fact to fact,
  which doubt could break. Feeling is the immediate unity of the
  subject and object. I am pained, because I cannot rid myself of an
  element which is already within me; I am lifted into the emotion of
  pleasure, or happiness, or bliss, by the consciousness that I am
  already at one with an object that fulfils <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg323" id="pg323">323</a></span> my longings and
  satisfies my needs. Hence, there seems to be ground for saying that,
  in this instance, the witness cannot lie; for it cannot go before the
  fact, as it is itself the effect of the fact. If the emotion is
  pleasurable it is the consciousness of the unity within; if it is
  painful, of the disunity. In feeling, I am absolutely with myself;
  and there seems, therefore, to be no need of attempting to justify,
  by means of reason, a faith in God which manifests itself in emotion.
  The emotion itself is its own sufficient witness, a direct result of
  the intimate union of man with the object of devotion. Nay, we may go
  further, and say that the demand is an unjust one, which betrays
  ignorance of the true nature of moral intuition and religious
  feeling.</p>

  <p>I am not concerned to deny the truth that lies in the view here
  stated; and no advocate of the dignity of human reason, or of the
  worth of human knowledge, is called upon to deny it. There is a sense
  in which the conviction of "faith" or "feeling" is more intimate and
  strong than any process of proof. But this does not in any wise
  justify the contention of those who maintain that we can feel what we
  do not in any sense know, or that the heart can testify to that of
  which the intellect is absolutely silent.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"So let us say&mdash;not 'Since we know, we love,'</p>

    <p>But rather, 'Since we love, we know enough.'"<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>A Pillar at Sebzevar</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In these two lines there are combined the truth I <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg324" id="pg324">324</a></span> would
  acknowledge, and the error I would confute. Love is, in one way,
  sufficient knowledge; or, rather, it is the direct testimony of that
  completest knowledge, in which subject and object interpenetrate.
  For, where love is, all foreign elements have been eliminated. There
  is not "one and one with a shadowy third"; but the object is brought
  within the self as constituting part of its very life. This is
  involved in all the great forms of human thought&mdash;in science and
  art, no less than in morality and religion. It is the truth that we
  love, and only that, which is altogether ours. By means of love the
  poet is</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Made one with Nature. There is heard</p>

    <p>His voice in all her music, from the moan</p>

    <p>Of thunder to the song of night's sweet bird ";</p>
  </div>

  <p>and it is because he is made one with her that he is able to
  reveal her inmost secrets. "Man," said Fichte, "can will nothing but
  what he loves; his love is the sole and at the same time the
  infallible spring of his volition, and of all his life's striving and
  movement." It is only when we have identified ourselves with an
  ideal, and made its realization our own interest, that we strive to
  attain it. Love is revelation in knowledge, inspiration in art,
  motive in morality, and the fulness of religious joy.</p>

  <p>But, although in this sense love is greater than knowledge, it is
  a grave error to separate it from knowledge. In the life of man at
  least, the separation of the emotional and intellectual elements
  extinguishes both. We cannot know that in which we <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg325" id="pg325">325</a></span> have no interest.
  The very effort to comprehend an object rests on interest, or the
  feeling of ourselves in it; so that knowledge, as well as morality,
  may be said to begin in love. We cannot know except we love; but, on
  the other hand, we cannot love that which we do not in some degree
  know. Wherever the frontiers of knowledge may be it is certain that
  there is nothing beyond them which can either arouse feeling, or be a
  steadying centre for it. Emotion is like a climbing plant. It clings
  to the tree of knowledge, adding beauty to its strength. But, without
  knowledge, it is impossible for man. There is no feeling which is not
  also incipient knowledge; for feeling is only the subjective side of
  knowledge&mdash;that face of the known fact which is turned
  inwards.</p>

  <p>If, therefore, the poet's agnosticism were taken literally, and,
  in his philosophical poems he obviously means it to be taken
  literally, it would lead to a denial of the very principles of
  religion and morality, which it was meant to support. His appeal to
  love would then, strictly speaking, be an appeal to the love of
  nothing known, or knowable; and such love is impossible. For love, if
  it is to be distinguished from the organic, impulse of beast towards
  beast, must have an object. A mere instinctive activity of
  benevolence in man, by means of which he lightened the sorrows of his
  brethren, if not informed with knowledge, would have no more moral
  worth than the grateful warmth of the sun. Such love as this there
  may be in the animal <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg326" id=
  "pg326">326</a></span> creation. If the bird is not rational, we may
  say that it builds its nest and lines it for its brood, pines for its
  partner and loves it, at the bidding of the returning spring, in much
  the same way as the meadows burst into flower. Without knowledge, the
  whole process is merely a natural one; or, if it be more, it is so
  only in so far as the life of emotion can be regarded as a foretaste
  of the life of thought. But such a natural process is not possible to
  man. Every activity in him is relative to his self-consciousness, and
  takes a new character from that relation. His love at the best and
  worst is the love of something that he knows, and in which he seeks
  to find himself made rich with new sufficiency. Thus love can not
  "ally" itself with ignorance. It is, indeed, an impulse pressing for
  the closer communion of the lover with the object of his love.</p>

  <div class="footnote">

  </div>

  <p>But, for a being such as Browning describes, who is shut up within
  the blind walls of his own self, the self-transcending impulse of
  love would be impossible. If man's inner consciousness is to be
  conceived as a dark room shutting out the world, upon whose shadowy
  phenomena the candle of introspection throws a dim and uncertain
  light, then <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg327" id=
  "pg327">327</a></span> he can have no interest outside of himself;
  nor can he ever take that first step in goodness, which carries him
  beyond his narrow individuality to seek and find a larger self in
  others. Morality, even in its lowest form, implies knowledge, and
  knowledge of something better than "those <i>apparent</i> other
  mortals." With the first dawn of the moral life comes the
  consciousness of an ideal, which is not actual; and such a break with
  the natural is not possible except to him who has known a better and
  desired it. The ethical endeavour of man is the attempt to convert
  ideas into actuality; and all his activity as moral agent takes place
  within the sphere that is illumined by the light of knowledge. If
  knowledge breaks down, there is no law of action which he can obey.
  The moral law that must be apprehended, and whose authority must be
  recognized by man, either sinks out of being or becomes an illusive
  phantom, if man is doomed to ignorance or false knowledge. To
  extinguish truth is to extinguish goodness.</p>

  <p>In like manner, religion, which the poet would fain defend for man
  by means of agnosticism, becomes impossible, if knowledge be denied.
  Religion is not blind emotion; nor can mere feeling, however
  ecstatic, ascend to God. Animals feel, but they are not, and cannot
  be, religious&mdash;unless they can know. The love of God implies
  knowledge. "I know Him whom I have believed" is the language of
  religion. For what is religion but a conscious identification of the
  self with One who is <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg328" id=
  "pg328">328</a></span> known to fulfil its needs and satisfy its
  aspirations? Agnosticism is thus directly destructive of it. We
  cannot, indeed, prove God as the conclusion of a syllogism, for He is
  the primary hypothesis of all proof. But, nevertheless, we cannot
  reach Him without knowledge. Emotion reveals no object, but is
  consequent upon the revelation of it; feeling yields no truth, but is
  the witness of the worth of a truth for the individual. If man were
  shut up to mere feeling, even the awe of the devout agnostic would be
  impossible. For the Unknowable cannot generate any emotion. It
  appears to do so, only because the Unknowable of the agnostic is not
  altogether unknown to him; but is a vast, abysmal "Something," that
  has occupied with its shadowy presence the field of his imagination.
  It is paganism stricken with the plague, and philosophy afflicted
  with blindness, that build altars to an unknown God. The highest and
  the strongest faith, the deepest trust and the most loving, come with
  the fullest knowledge. Indeed, the distinction between the awe of the
  agnostic, which is the lowest form of religion, and that highest form
  in which perfect love casteth out fear, springs from the fuller
  knowledge of the nature of the object of warship, which the latter
  implies. Thus, religion and morality grow with the growth of
  knowledge; and neither has a worse enemy than ignorance. The human
  spirit cannot grow in a one-sided manner. Devotion to great moral
  ends is possible, only through the deepening and widening of man's
  knowledge of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg329" id=
  "pg329">329</a></span> nature of the world. Those who know God best,
  render unto Him the purest service.</p>

  <p>So evident is this, that it seems at first sight to be difficult
  to account for that antagonism to the intellect and distrust of its
  deliverances, which are so emphatically expressed in the writings of
  Browning, and which are marked characteristics of the ordinary
  religious opinion of our day. On closer examination, however, we
  shall discover that it is not pure emotion, or mere feeling, whose
  authority is set above that of reason, but rather the emotion which
  is the result of knowledge. The appeal of the religious man from the
  doubts and difficulties, which reason levels against "the faith," is
  really an appeal to the character that lies behind the emotion. The
  conviction of the heart, that refuses to yield to the arguments of
  the understanding, is not <i>mere</i> feeling; but, rather, the
  complex experience of the past life, that manifests itself in
  feeling. When an individual, clinging to his moral or religious
  faith, says, "I have felt it," he opposes to the doubt, not his
  feeling as such, but his personality in all the wealth of its
  experience. The appeal to the heart is the appeal to the unproved,
  but not, therefore, unauthorized, testimony of the best men at their
  best moments, when their vision of truth is clearest. No one pretends
  that "the loud and empty voice of untrained passion and prejudice"
  has any authority in matters of moral and religious faith; though, in
  such cases, "feeling" may lack neither depth nor intensity. If the
  "feelings" of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg330" id=
  "pg330">330</a></span> the good man were dissociated from his
  character, and stripped bare of all the significance they obtain
  therefrom, their worthlessness would become apparent. The profound
  error of condemning knowledge in order to honour feeling, is hidden
  only by the fact that the feeling is already informed and inspired
  with knowledge. Religious agnosticism, like all other forms of the
  theory of nescience, derives its plausibility from the adventitious
  help it purloins from the knowledge which it condemns.</p>

  <p>That it is to such feeling that Browning really appeals against
  knowledge becomes abundantly evident, when we bear in mind that he
  always calls it "love." For love in man is never ignorant. It knows
  its object, and is a conscious identification of the self with it.
  And to Browning, the object of love, when love is at its
  best&mdash;of that love by means of which he refutes intellectual
  pessimism&mdash;is mankind. The revolt of the heart against all evil
  is a desire for the good of all men. In other words, his refuge
  against the assailing doubts which spring from the intellect, is in
  the moral consciousness. But that consciousness is no mere emotion;
  it is a consciousness which knows the highest good, and moves in
  sympathy with it. It is our maturest wisdom; for it is the
  manifestation of the presence and activity of the ideal, the fullest
  knowledge and the surest. Compared with this, the emotion linked to
  ignorance, of which the poet speaks in his philosophic theory, is a
  very poor thing. It is poorer than the lowest human
  love.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg331" id=
  "pg331">331</a></span>

  <p>Now, if this higher interpretation of the term "heart" be
  accepted, it is easily seen why its authority should seem higher than
  that of reason; and particularly, if it be remembered that, while the
  heart is thus widened to take in all direct consciousness of the
  ideal, "the reason" is reduced to the power of reflection, or mental
  analysis. "The heart," in this sense, is the intensest unity of the
  complex experiences of a whole life, while "the reason" is taken
  merely as a faculty which invents arguments, and provides grounds and
  evidences; it is what is called, in the language of German
  philosophy, the "understanding." Now, in this sense, the
  understanding has, at best, only a borrowed authority. It is the
  faculty of rules rather than of principles. It is ever dogmatic,
  assertive, repellent, hard; and it always advances its forces in
  single line. Its logic never convinced any one of truth or error,
  unless, beneath the arguments which it advanced, there lay some
  deeper principle of concord. Thus, the opposition between "faith and
  reason," rightly interpreted, is that between a concrete experience,
  instinct with life and conviction, and a mechanical arrangement of
  abstract arguments. The quarrel of the heart is not with reason, but
  with reasons. "Evidences of Christianity?" said Coleridge; "I am
  weary of the word." It is this weariness of evidence, of the endless
  arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, which has caused so many to
  distrust reason and knowledge, and which has sometimes driven
  believers to the dangerous expedient <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg332" id="pg332">332</a></span> of making their faith dogmatic and
  absolute. Nor have the opponents of "the faith" been slow to seize
  the opportunity thus offered them. "From the moment that a religion
  solicits the aid of philosophy, its ruin is inevitable," said Heine.
  "In the attempt at defence, it prates itself into destruction.
  Religion, like every absolutism, must not seek to justify itself.
  Prometheus is bound to the rock by a silent force. Yea, Aeschylus
  permits not personified power to utter a single word. It must remain
  mute. The moment that a religion ventures to print a catechism
  supported by arguments, the moment that a political absolutism
  publishes an official newspaper, both are near their end. But therein
  consists our triumph: we have brought our adversaries to speech, and
  they must reckon with us."<sup>A</sup> But, we may answer, religion is
  <i>not</i> an absolutism; and, therefore, it is <i>not</i> near its
  end when it ventures to justify itself. On the contrary, no spiritual
  power, be it moral or religious, can maintain its authority, if it
  assumes a despotic attitude; for the human spirit inevitably moves
  towards freedom, and that movement is the deepest necessity of its
  nature, which it cannot escape. "Religion, on the ground of its
  sanctity, and law, on the ground of its majesty, often resist the
  sifting of their claims. But in so doing, they inevitably awake a not
  unjust suspicion that their claims are ill-founded. They can command
  the unfeigned homage of man, only when they have <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg333" id="pg333">333</a></span> shown themselves
  able to stand the test of free inquiry."</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Religion and Philosophy in Germany</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>And if it is an error to suppose, with Browning, that the primary
  truths of the moral and religious consciousness belong to a region
  which is higher than knowledge, and can, from that side, be neither
  assailed nor defended; it is also an error to suppose that reason is
  essentially antagonistic to them. The facts of morality and religion
  are precisely the richest facts of knowledge; and that faith is the
  most secure which is most completely illumined by reason. Religion at
  its best is not a dogmatic despotism, nor is reason a merely critical
  and destructive faculty. If reason is loyal to the truth of religion
  on which it is exercised, it will reach beneath all the conflict and
  clamour of disputation, to the principle of unity, on which, as we
  have seen, both reason and religion rest.</p>

  <p>The "faith" to which religious spirits appeal against all the
  attacks of doubt, "the love" of Browning, is really implicit reason;
  it is "abbreviated" or concentrated knowledge; it is the manifold
  experiences of life focussed into an intense unity. And, on the other
  hand, the "reason" which they condemn is what Carlyle calls the
  logic-chopping faculty. In taking the side of faith when troubled
  with difficulties which they cannot lay, they are really defending
  the cause of reason against that of the understanding. For it is
  quite true that the understanding, that is, the reason as reflective
  or critical, can never bring about either a <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg334" id="pg334">334</a></span> moral or
  religious life. It cannot create a religion, any more than physiology
  can produce men. The reflection which brings doubt is always
  secondary; it can only exercise itself on a given material. As Hegel
  frequently pointed out, it is not the function of moral philosophy to
  create or to institute a morality or religion, but to understand
  them. The facts must first be given; they must be actual experiences
  of the human spirit. Moral philosophy and theology differ from the
  moral or religious life, in the same way as geology differs from the
  earth, or astronomy from the heavenly bodies. The latter are facts;
  the former are theories about the facts. Religion is an attitude of
  the human spirit towards the highest; morality is the realization of
  character; and these are not to be confused with their reflective
  interpretations. Much of the difficulty in these matters comes from
  the lack of a clear distinction between <i>beliefs</i> and
  <i>creeds</i>.</p>

  <p>Further, not only are the utterances of the heart prior to the
  deliverances of the intellect in this sense, but it may also be
  admitted that the latter can never do full justice to the contents of
  the former. So rich is character in content and so complex is
  spiritual life, that we can never, by means of reflection, lift into
  clear consciousness all the elements that enter into it. Into the
  organism of our experience, which is our faith, there is continually
  absorbed the subtle influences of our complex natural and social
  environment. We grow by <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg335" id=
  "pg335">335</a></span> means of them, as the plant grows by feeding
  on the soil and the sunshine and dew. It is as impossible for us to
  set forth, one by one, the truths and errors which we have thus
  worked into our mental and moral life, as it is to keep a reckoning
  of the physical atoms with which the natural life builds up the body.
  Hence, every attempt to justify these truths seems inadequate; and
  the defence which the understanding sets up for the faith, always
  seems partial and cold. Who ever fully expressed his deepest
  convictions? The consciousness of the dignity of the moral law
  affected Kant like the view of the starry firmament, and generated a
  feeling of the sublime which words could not express; and the
  religious ecstasy of the saints cannot be confined within the
  channels of speech, but floods the soul with overmastering power,
  possessing all its faculties. In this respect, it will always remain
  true that the greatest facts of human experience reach beyond all
  knowledge. Nay, we may add further, that in this respect the simplest
  of these facts passes all understanding. Still, as we have already
  seen, it is reason that constitutes them; that which is presented to
  reason for explanation, in knowledge and morality and religion, is
  itself the product of reason. Reason is the power which, by
  interaction with our environment, has generated the whole of our
  experience. And, just as natural science interprets the phenomena
  given to it by ordinary opinion, <i>i.e.</i>, interprets and purifies
  a lower form of knowledge by converting <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg336" id="pg336">336</a></span> it into a higher;
  so the task of reason when it is exercised upon morality and
  religion, is simply to evolve, and amplify the meaning of its own
  products. The movement from morality and religion to moral philosophy
  and the philosophy of religion, is thus a movement from reason to
  reason, from the implicit to the explicit, from the germ to the
  developed fulness of life and structure. In this matter, as in all
  others wherein the human spirit is concerned, that which is first by
  nature is last in genesis&mdash;[Greek: nika d' ho prôtos kai
  teleutaios dramôn.] The whole history of the moral and religious
  experience of mankind is comprised in the statement, that the
  implicit reason which we call "faith" is ever developing towards full
  consciousness of itself; and that, at its first beginning, and
  throughout the whole ascending process of this development, the
  highest is present in it as a self-manifesting power.</p>

  <p>But this process from the almost instinctive intuitions of the
  heart towards the morality and religion of freedom, being a process
  of evolution, necessarily involves conflict. There are men, it is
  true, the unity of whose moral and religious faith is never
  completely broken by doubt; just as there are men who are not forced
  by the contradictions in the first interpretation of the world by
  ordinary experience to attempt to re-interpret it by means of science
  and philosophy.</p>

  <p>Jean Paul Richter said that he knew another way of being happy,
  beside that of soaring away so far above the clouds of life, that its
  miseries looked small, and the whole external world shrunk into a
  little child's garden. It was, "Simply to sink down into this little
  garden; and there to nestle yourself so snugly, so homewise, in some
  furrow, that in looking out from your warm lark-nest, you likewise
  can discern no wolf-dens, charnel-houses, or thunder-rods, but only
  blades and ears, every one of which, for the nest-bird, is a tree,
  and a sun-screen, and rain-screen." There is a similar way of being
  good, with a goodness which, though limited, is pure and perfect in
  nature. Nay, we may even admit that such lives are frequently the
  most complete and beautiful, just as the fairest flowers grow, not on
  the tallest trees, but on the fragile plants at their foot.
  Nevertheless, even in the case of those persons who have never broken
  from the traditional faith of the past, or felt it to be inadequate,
  that faith has been silently reconstructed in a new synthesis of
  knowledge. Spiritual life cannot come by inheritance; but every
  individual must acquire a faith for himself, and turn his spiritual
  environment into personal experience. "A man may be a heretic in the
  truth," said Milton, "and if he believe things only because his
  pastor says so, or the assembly so <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg338" id="pg338">338</a></span> determines, without knowing other
  reason, though his belief be true, yet the very truth he holds
  becomes his heresy." It is truth to another but tradition to him; it
  is a creed and not a conviction. Browning fully recognizes the need
  of this conflict&mdash;</p>

  becomes a malarious swamp. Movement is the law of life; and knowledge
  of the principles of morality and religion, as of all other
  principles, must, in order to grow, be felt from time to time as
  inadequate and untrue. There are men and ages whose mission
  is&mdash;</p>

  </div>

  <p>Such a spirit of criticism seems to many to exercise a merely
  destructive power, and those who have not felt the inadequacy of the
  inherited faith defend themselves against it, as the enemy of their
  lives. But no logic, or assailing doubt, could have power against the
  testimony of "the heart," unless it was rooted in deeper and truer
  principles than those which it attacked. Nothing can overpower
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg339" id="pg339">339</a></span> truth
  except a larger truth; and, in such a conflict, the truth in the old
  view will ultimately take the side of the new, and find its
  subordinate position within it. It has happened, not infrequently, as
  in the case of the Encyclop&aelig;dists, that the explicit truths of
  reason were more abstract, that is, less true, than the implicit
  "faith" which they assailed. The central truths of religion have
  often proved themselves to possess some stubborn, though
  semi-articulate power, which could ultimately overcome or subordinate
  the more partial and explicit truths of abstract science. It is this
  that gives plausibility to the idea, that the testimony of the heart
  is more reliable than that of the intellect. But, in this case also,
  it was really reason that triumphed. It was the truth which proved
  itself to be immortal, and not any mere emotion. The insurrection of
  the intellect against the heart is quelled, only when the untruth, or
  abstract character, of the principle of the assailants has been made
  manifest, and when the old faith has yielded up its unjust gains, and
  proved its vitality and strength by absorbing the truth that gave
  vigour to the attack. Just as in morality it is the ideal, or the
  unity of the whole moral life, that breaks up into differences, so
  also here it is the implicit faith which, as it grows, breaks forth
  into doubts. In both cases alike, the negative movement which induces
  despair, is only a phase of a positive process&mdash;the process of
  reason towards a fuller, a more articulate and complex, realization
  of itself.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg340" id=
  "pg340">340</a></span>

  <p>Hence it follows that the value and strength of a faith
  corresponds accurately to the doubts it has overcome. Those who never
  went forth to battle cannot come home heroes. It is only when the
  earthquake has tried the towers, and destroyed the sense of security,
  that</p>

  <p>"Well knows he who uses to consider, that our faith and knowledge
  thrive by exercise, as well as our limbs and complexion."</p>

  <p>It was, thus, I conclude, a deep speculative error into which
  Browning fell, when, in order to substantiate his optimistic faith,
  he stigmatized human knowledge as merely apparent. Knowledge does not
  fail, except in the sense in which morality also fails; it does not
  at any time attain to the ultimate truth, any more than the moral
  life is in any of its activities<sup>B</sup> a complete embodiment of the
  absolute good. It is not given to man, who is essentially
  progressive, to reach the ultimate term of development. For there is
  no ultimate term: life never stands still. But, for the same reason,
  there is no ultimate failure. The whole history of man is a history
  of growth. If, however, knowledge did <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg341" id="pg341">341</a></span> fail, then morality too must fail;
  and the appeal which the poet makes from the intellect to the heart,
  would be an appeal to mere emotion. Finally, even if we take a
  generous view of the poet's meaning, and put out of consideration the
  theory he expresses when he is deliberately philosophizing, there is
  still no appeal from the reason to an alien and higher authority. The
  appeal to "the heart" is, at best, only an appeal from the
  understanding to the reason, from a conscious logic to the more
  concrete fact constituted by reason, which reflection has failed to
  comprehend in its completeness; at its worst, it is an appeal from
  truth to prejudice, from belief to dogma.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>B: See Chapter IX., p. <a href="#pg291">291.</a></p>
  </div>

  <p>And in both cases alike, the appeal is futile; for, whether "the
  heart be wiser than the head," or not, whether the faith which is
  assailed be richer or poorer, truer or more false, than the logic
  which is directed against it, an appeal to the heart cannot any
  longer restore the unity of the broken life. Once reflection has set
  in, there is no way of turning away its destructive might, except by
  deeper reflection. The implicit faith of the heart must become the
  explicit faith of reason. "There is no final and satisfactory issue
  from such an endless internal debate and conflict, until the 'heart'
  has learnt to speak the language of the head&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, until
  the permanent principles, which underlay and gave strength to faith,
  have been brought into the light of distinct consciousness."<sup>A</sup></p>

    <p>A: Caird's <i>Comte</i>.</p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg342" id="pg342">342</a></span>

  <p>I conclude, therefore, that the poet was right in saying that, in

  <p>But it was a profound error, which contained in it the destruction

  quality of God" a love that excludes reason, and the quality of man
  an intellect incapable of knowing truth. Such in-congruous elements
  could never be combined into the unity of a character. A love that
  was mere emotion could not yield a motive for morality, or a
  principle of religion. A philosophy of life which is based on
  agnosticism is an explicit self-contradiction, which can help no one.

  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Andrea del Sarto</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>I have tried to show that Browning's theory of life, in so far as
  it is expressed in his philosophical poems, rests on agnosticism; and
  that such a theory is inconsistent with the moral and religious
  interests of man. The idea that truth is unattainable was represented
  by Browning as a bulwark of the faith, but it proved on examination
  to be treacherous. His optimism was found to have no better
  foundation than personal conviction, which any one was free to deny,
  and which the poet could in no wise prove. The evidence of the heart,
  to which he appealed, was the evidence of an emotion severed from
  intelligence, and, therefore, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg344"
  id="pg344">344</a></span> without any content whatsoever. "The
  faith," which he professed, was not the faith that anticipates and
  invites proof, but a faith which is incapable of proof. In casting
  doubt upon the validity of knowledge, he degraded the whole spiritual
  nature of man; for a love that is ignorant of its object is a blind
  impulse, and a moral consciousness that does not know the law is an
  impossible phantom&mdash;a self-contradiction.</p>

  <p>But, although Browning's explicitly philosophical theory of life
  fails, there appears in his earlier poems, where his poetical freedom
  was not yet trammelled, nor his moral enthusiasm restrained by the
  stubborn difficulties of reflective thought, a far truer and richer
  view. In this period of pure poetry, his conception of man was less
  abstract than in his later works, and his inspiration was more direct
  and full. The poet's dialectical ingenuity increased with the growth
  of his reflective tendencies; but his relation to the great
  principles of spiritual life seemed to become less intimate, and his
  expression of them more halting. What we find in his earlier works
  are vigorous ethical convictions, a glowing optimistic faith,
  achieving their fitting expression in impassioned poetry; what we
  find in his later works are arguments, which, however richly adorned
  with poetic metaphors, have lost the completeness and energy of life.
  His poetic fancies are like chaplets which crown the dead. Lovers of
  the poet, who seek in his poems for inspiring expressions of their
  hope <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg345" id="pg345">345</a></span>
  and faith, will always do well in turning from his militant
  metaphysics to his art.</p>

  <p>In his case, as in that of many others, spiritual experience was
  far richer than the theory which professed to explain it. The task of
  lifting his moral convictions into the clear light of conscious
  philosophy was beyond his power. The theory of the failure of
  knowledge, which he seems to have adopted far too easily from the
  current doctrine of the schools, was fundamentally inconsistent with
  his generous belief in the moral progress of man; and it maimed the
  expression of that belief. The result of his work as a philosopher is
  a confession of complete ignorance and the helpless asseveration of a
  purely dogmatic faith.</p>

  <p>The fundamental error of the poet's philosophy lies, I believe, in
  that severance of feeling and intelligence, love and reason, which
  finds expression in <i>La Saisiaz</i>, <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i>,
  <i>The Parleyings</i>, and <i>Asolando</i>. Such an absolute division
  is not to be found in <i>Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day</i>, <i>Rabbi
  Ben Ezra</i>, <i>A Death in the Desert</i>, or in <i>The Ring and the
  Book</i>; nor even in <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>. In these works we
  are not perplexed by the strange combination of a nature whose
  principle is love, and which is capable of infinite progress, with an
  intelligence whose best efforts end in ignorance. Rather, the spirit
  of man is regarded as one, in all its manifestations; and, therefore,
  as progressive on all sides of its activity. The widening of his
  knowledge, which is brought about by increasing experience, is
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg346" id="pg346">346</a></span>
  parallel with the deepening and purifying of his moral life. In all
  Browning's works, indeed, with the possible exception of
  <i>Paracelsus</i>, love is conceived as having a place and function
  of supreme importance in the development of the soul. Its divine
  origin and destiny are never obscured; but knowledge is regarded as
  merely human, and, therefore, as falling short of the truth. In
  <i>Easter-Day</i> it is definitely contrasted with love, and shown to
  be incapable of satisfying the deepest wants of man. It is, at the
  best, only a means to the higher purposes of moral activity, and,
  except in the <i>Grammarian's Funeral</i>, it is nowhere regarded as
  in itself a worthy end.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"'Tis one thing to know, and another to practise.</p>

    <p>And thence I conclude that the real God-function</p>

    <p>Is to furnish a motive and injunction</p>

  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Even here, there is implied that the motive comes otherwise than
  by knowledge; still, taking these earlier poems as a whole, we may
  say that in them knowledge is regarded as means to morality and not
  as in any sense contrasted with or destructive of it. Man's motives
  are rational motives; the ends he seeks are ends conceived and even
  constituted by his intelligence, and not purposes blindly followed as
  by instinct and impulse.</p>

  <p>asks the Pope. Moral progress is not secured apart from, or in
  spite of knowledge. We are not exhorted to reject the verdict of the
  latter as illusive, in order to confide in a faith which not only
  fails to receive support from the defective intelligence, but
  maintains its own integrity only by repudiating the testimony of the
  reason. In the distinction between knowledge as means and love as
  end, it is easy, indeed, to detect a tendency to degrade the former
  into a mere temporary expedient, whereby moral ends may be served.
  The poet speaks of "such knowledge as is possible to man." The
  attitude he assumes towards it is apologetic, and betrays a keen
  consciousness of its limitation, and particularly of its utter
  inadequacy to represent the infinite. In the speech of the
  Pope&mdash;-which can scarcely be regarded otherwise than as the
  poet's own maturest utterance on the great moral and religious
  questions raised by the tragedy of Pompilia's death&mdash;we find
  this view vividly expressed:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  Himself," while, "by the little mind of man, He is reduced to
  littleness that suits man's faculty." In these words, and others that
  might be quoted, the poet shows that he is profoundly impressed with
  the distinction between human knowledge, and that knowledge which is
  adequate to the whole nature and extent of being. And in
  <i>Christmas-Eve</i> he repudiates with a touch of scorn, the
  absolute idealism, which is supposed to identify altogether human
  reason with divine reason; and he commends the German critic for not
  making</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Christmas-Eve</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Nowhere in Browning, unless we except <i>Paracelsus</i>, is there
  any sign of an inclination to treat man's knowledge in the same
  spirit as he deals with man's love&mdash;namely, as a direct
  emanation from the inmost nature of God, a divine element that
  completes and crowns man's life on earth. On the contrary, he shows a
  persistent tendency to treat love as a power higher in nature than
  reason, and to give to it a supreme place in the formation of
  character; and, as he grows older, that tendency grows in strength.
  The philosophical poems, in which love is made all in all, and
  knowledge is reduced to nescience follow by logical evolution from
  principles, the influence of which we can detect even in his earlier
  works. Still, in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg349" id=
  "pg349">349</a></span> latter, these principles are only latent, and
  are far from holding undisputed sway. Browning was, at first,
  restrained from exclusive devotion to abstract views, by the
  suggestions which the artistic spirit receives through its immediate
  contact with the facts of life. That contact it is very difficult for
  philosophy to maintain as it pursues its effort after universal
  truth. Philosophy is obliged to analyze in order to define, and, in
  that process, it is apt to lose something of that completeness of
  representation, which belongs to art. For art is always engaged in
  presenting the universal in the form of a particular object of
  beauty. Its product is a "known unknown," but the unknown is the
  unexhausted reality of a fact of intuition. Nor can analysis ever
  exhaust it; theory can never catch up art, or explain all that is in
  it. On similar grounds, it may be shown that it is impossible for
  reason to lay bare all the elements that enter into its first complex
  product, which we call faith. In religion, as in art, man is aware of
  more than he knows; his articulate logic cannot do justice to all the
  truths of the "heart." "The supplementary reflux of light" of
  philosophy cannot "illustrate all the inferior grades" of knowledge.
  Man will never completely understand himself.</p>

  <p>I believe that it is possible, by the help of the intuitions of
  Browning's highest artistic period, to bring together again the
  elements of his broken faith, and to find in them suggestions of a
  truer philosophy of life than anything which the poet himself
  achieved. Perhaps, indeed, it is not easy, nor altogether fair, to
  press the passionate utterances of his religious rapture into the
  service of metaphysics, and to treat the unmeasured language of
  emotion as the expression of a definite doctrine. Nevertheless,
  rather than set forth a new defence of the faith, which his
  agnosticism left exposed to the assaults of doubt and denial, it is
  better to make Browning correct his own errors, and to appeal from
  the metaphysician to the poet, from the sobriety of the logical
  understanding to the inspiration of poetry.</p>

  <p>I have already indicated what seems to me to be the defective
  element in the poet's philosophy of life. His theory of knowledge is
  in need of revision; and what he asserts of human love, should be
  applied point by point to human reason. As man is ideally united with
  the absolute on the side of moral emotion (if the phrase may be
  pardoned), so he is ideally united with the absolute on the side of
  the intellect. As there is no difference of <i>nature</i> between
  God's goodness and man's goodness, so there is no difference of
  nature between God's <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg351" id=
  "pg351">351</a></span> truth and man's truth. There are not two kinds
  of righteousness or mercy; there are not two kinds of truth. Human
  nature is not "cut in two with a hatchet," as the poet implies that
  it is. There is in man a lower and a higher element, ever at war with
  each other; still he is not a mixture, or agglomerate, of the finite
  and the infinite. A love perfect in nature cannot be linked to an
  intelligence imperfect in nature; if it were, the love would be
  either a blind impulse or an erring one. Both morality and religion
  demand the presence in man of a perfect ideal, which is at war with
  his imperfections; but an ideal is possible, only to a being endowed
  with a capacity for knowing the truth. In degrading human knowledge,
  the poet is disloyal to the fundamental principle of the Christian
  faith which he professed&mdash;that God can and does manifest himself
  in man.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, we are not to take the unity of man with God,
  of man's moral ideal with the All-perfect, as implying, on the moral
  side, an absolute identification of the finite with the infinite; nor
  can we do so on the side of knowledge. Man's moral life and rational
  activity in knowledge are the process of the highest. But man is
  neither first, nor last; he is not the original author of his love,
  any more than of his reason; he is not the divine principle of the
  whole to which he belongs, although he is potentially in harmony with
  it. Both sides of his being are equally touched with
  imperfection&mdash;his love, no less than his reason. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg352" id="pg352">352</a></span> Perfect love
  would imply perfect wisdom, as perfect wisdom, perfect love. But
  absolute terms are not applicable to man, who is ever <i>on the
  way</i> to goodness and truth, progressively manifesting the power of
  the ideal that dwells in him, and whose very life is conflict and
  acquirement.</p>

  immortal course, "the life after life in unlimited series," which is
  so inspiring in his early poetry. He conceives that we are here, on
  this lower earth, just to learn one form, the elementary lesson and
  alphabet of goodness, namely, "the uses of the flesh": in other
  lives, other achievements. The separation of the soul from its
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg353" id="pg353">353</a></span>
  instrument has very little significance to the poet; for it does not
  arrest the course of moral development.</p>

  <p>Further on in the Pope's soliloquy, the poet shows that, at that
  time, he fully recognized the risk of entrusting the spiritual
  interests of man to the enthusiasm of elevated feeling, or to the
  mere intuitions of a noble heart. Such intuitions will sometimes
  guide a man happily, as in the case of Caponsacchi:</p>

  <p>But, on the other hand, such impulses, not instructed by knowledge
  of the truth, and made steadfast to the laws of the higher life by a
  reasoned conviction, lead man rightly only by accident. In such a

  to other ways of life.</p>

  <p>This poem which, both in its moral wisdom and artistic worth,
  marks the high tide of Browning's poetic insight, while he is not as
  yet concerned with the defence of any theory or the discussion of any
  abstract question, contrasts strongly with the later poems, where
  knowledge is dissembling ignorance, faith is blind trust, and love is
  a mere impulse of the heart. Having failed to meet the difficulties
  of reflection, the poet turned upon the intellect. Knowledge becomes
  to him an offence, and to save his faith he plucked out his right eye
  and entered into the kingdom maimed. In <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i> the
  ascent into another life is triumphant, like that of a conqueror
  bearing with him the spoils of earth; but in the later poems he
  escapes with a bare belief, and the loss of all his rich possessions
  of knowledge, like a shipwrecked mariner whose goods have been thrown
  overboard. His philosophy was a treacherous ally to his faith.</p>

  <p>But there is another consideration which shows that the poet, as
  artist, recognized the need of giving to reason a larger function
  than seems to be possible according to the theory in his later works.
  In the early poems there is no hint of the doctrine that
  demonstrative knowledge of the good, and of the necessity of its law,
  would destroy freedom. On the contrary, there are suggestions which
  point to the opposite doctrine, according to which knowledge is the
  condition of freedom.</p>

  <p>While in his later poems the poet speaks of love as an
  impulse&mdash;either blind or bound to erring <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg359" id="pg359">359</a></span>
  knowledge&mdash;and of the heart as made to love, in his earlier ones
  he seems to treat man as free to work out his own purposes, and act
  out his own ideals. Browning here finds himself able to maintain the
  dependence of man upon God without destroying morality. He regards
  man's impulses not as blind instincts, but as falling <i>within</i>
  his rational nature, and constituting the forms of its activity. He
  recognizes the distinction between a mere impulse, in the sense of a
  tendency to act, which is directed by a foreign power, and an impulse
  informed, that is, directed by reason. According to this view, it is
  reason which at once gives man the independence of foreign authority,
  which is implied in morality, and constitutes that affinity between
  man and God, which is implied by religion. No doubt, the impulse to
  know, like the impulse to love, was put into man: his whole nature is
  a gift, and he is therefore, in this sense, completely dependent upon
  God&mdash;"God's all, man's nought." But, on the other hand, it
  <i>is</i> a rational nature which has been put into him, and not an
  irrational impulse. Or, rather, the impulse that constitutes his life
  as man, is the self-evolving activity of reason.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Who speaks of man, then, must not sever</p>

    <p>Man's very elements from man."<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Christmas-Eve</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>However the rational nature of man has come to be, whether by
  emanation or creation, it necessarily brings freedom with it, and all
  its risks and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg360" id=
  "pg360">360</a></span> possibilities. It is of the very essence of
  reason that it should find its law within itself.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i4">"God's all, man's nought:</p>

    <p>But also, God, whose pleasure brought</p>

    <p>Man into being, stands away</p>

    <p>As it were a hand-breadth off, to give</p>

    <p>Room for the newly-made to live,</p>

    <p>And look at Him from a place apart,</p>

    <p>And use his gifts of brain and heart,</p>

    <p>Given, indeed, but to keep for ever."<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>Christmas-Eve</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Thus, while insisting on the absolute priority of God, and the
  original receptivity of man; while recognizing that love, reason, and
  every inner power and outer opportunity are lent to man, Browning
  does not forget what these powers are. Man can only act as man; he
  must obey his nature, as the stock or stone or plant obeys its
  nature. But to act as man is to act freely, and man's nature is not
  that of a stock or stone. He is rational, and cannot but be rational.
  Hence he can neither be ruled, as dead matter is ruled, by natural
  law; nor live, like a bird, the life of innocent impulse or instinct.
  He is placed, from the very first, on "the table land whence life
  upsprings aspiring to be immortality." He is a
  spirit,&mdash;responsible because he is free, and free because he is
  rational.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Man, therefore, stands on his own stock</p>

    <p>Of love and power as a pin-point rock,</p>

    <p>And, looks to God who ordained divorce</p>

    <p>Of the rock from His boundless continent."<sup>B</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>B: <i>Ibid.</i></p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg361" id="pg361">361</a></span>

  <p>The divorce is real, although ordained, but it is possible only in
  so far as man, by means of reason, constitutes his own ends of
  action. Impulse cannot bring it about. It is reason that enables man
  to free himself from the despotic authority of outer law, to relate
  himself to an inner law, and by reconciling inner and outer to attain
  to goodness. Thus reason is the source of all morality. And it also
  is the principle of religion, for it implies the highest and fullest
  manifestation of the absolute.</p>

  <p>Although the first aspect of self-consciousness is its
  independence, which is, in turn, the first condition of morality,
  still this is only the first aspect. The rational being plants
  himself on his own individuality, stands aloof and alone in the
  rights of his freedom, <i>in order that</i> he may set out from
  thence to take possession, by means of knowledge and action, of the
  world in which he is placed. Reason is potentially absolute, capable
  of finding itself everywhere. So that in it man is "honour-clothed
  and glory-crowned."</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"This is the honour,&mdash;that no thing I know,</p>

  <p>That which is finite is hemmed in by other things, as well as

  for it no other thing to limit or determine it. There is nothing
  finally alien or foreign to reason. Freedom and infinitude,
  self-determination and absoluteness, imply each other. In so far as
  man is free, he is lifted above the finite. It was God's plan to make

  <p>This near affinity between the divine and human is just what
  Browning seems to repudiate in his later poems, when he speaks as if
  the absolute, in order to maintain its own supremacy over man, had to
  stint its gifts and endow him only with a defective reason. In the
  earlier period of the poet there is far less timidity. He then saw
  that the greater the gift, the greater the Giver; that only spirit
  can reveal spirit; that "God is glorified in man," and that love is
  at its fullest only when it gives itself.</p>

  <p>In insisting on such identity of the human spirit with the divine,
  our poet does not at any time run the risk of forgetting that the
  identity is not absolute. Absolute identity would be pantheism, which
  leaves God lonely and loveless, and extinguishes man, as well as his
  morality.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Man is not God, but hath God's end to serve,</p>

    <p>A Master to obey, a course to take,</p>

    <p>Somewhat to cast off, somewhat to become."<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>A Death in the Desert</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Man, at best, only moves <i>towards</i> his ideal: God is
  conceived as the ever-existing ideal. God, in short, is the term
  which signifies for us the Being who is eternally all in all, and
  who, therefore, is hidden from us who are only moving <i>towards</i>
  perfection, in the excess of the brightness of His own glory.
  Nevertheless, as Browning recognizes, the grandeur of God's
  perfection is just His outflowing love. And that love is never
  complete in its manifestation, till <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg364" id="pg364">364</a></span> it has given itself. Man's life, as
  spirit, is thus one in nature with that of the absolute. But the
  unity is not complete, because man is only potentially perfect. He is
  the process <i>of</i> the ideal; his life is the divine activity
  within him. Still, it is also man's activity. For the process, being
  the process of spirit, is a <i>free</i> process&mdash;one in which
  man himself energizes; so that, in doing God's will, he is doing his
  own highest will, and, in obeying the law of his own deepest nature,
  he is obeying God. The unity of divine and human within the spiritual
  life of man is a real unity, just because man is free; the identity
  manifests itself through the difference, and the difference is
  possible through the unity.</p>

  <p>Thus, in the light of an ideal which is moral, and therefore
  perfect&mdash;an ideal gradually realizing itself in a process which
  is endless&mdash;the poet is able to maintain at once the community
  between man and God, which is necessary to religion, and their
  independence, which is necessary to morality. The conception of God
  as giving, which is the main doctrine of Christianity, and of man as
  akin with God, is applied by him to the whole spiritual nature of
  man, and not merely to his emotion. The process of evolution is thus
  a process towards truth, as well as goodness; in fact, goodness and
  truth are known as inseparable. Knowledge, too, is a Divine
  endowment. "What gift of man is not from God descended?" What gift of
  God can be deceptive?</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg365" id=

  <p>The last words indicate a suspicion of a certain defect in
  knowledge, which is not recognized in human love; nevertheless, in
  these earlier poems, the poet does not analyze human nature into a
  finite and infinite, or seek to dispose of his difficulties by the
  deceptive solvent of a dualistic agnosticism. He treats spirit as a
  unity, and refuses to set love and reason against each other. Man's
  <i>life</i>, for the poet, and not merely man's love, begins with
  God, and returns back to God in the rapt recognition of God's perfect
  being by reason, and in the identification of man's purposes with His
  by means of will and love.</p>

    <p>He could not, what he knows now, know at first:</p>

    <p>What he considers that he knows to-day,</p>

    <p>Come but to-morrow, he will find mis-known;</p>

    <p>Getting increase of knowledge, since he learns</p>

    <p>Because he lives, which is to be a man,</p>

    <p>Set to instruct himself by his past self:</p>

    <p>First, like the brute, obliged by facts to learn,</p>

    <p>Next, as man may, obliged by his own mind,</p>

    <p>Bent, habit, nature, knowledge turned to law.</p>

    <p>God's gift was that man shall conceive of truth</p>

    <p>And yearn to gain it, catching at mistake,</p>

    <p>As midway help till he reach fact indeed?"<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>A Death in the Desert</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>"Progress," the poet says, is "man's distinctive mark alone." The
  endlessness of the progress, the fact that every truth known to-day
  seems misknown to-morrow, that every ideal once achieved only points
  to another and becomes itself a stepping stone, does not, as in his
  later days, bring despair to him. For the consciousness of failure is
  possible in knowledge, as in morality, only because there has come a
  fuller light. Browning does not, as yet, dwell exclusively on the
  negative element in progress, or forget that it is possible only
  through a deeper positive. He does not think that, because we turn
  our backs on what we have gained, we are therefore not going forward;
  nay, he asserts the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg367" id=
  "pg367">367</a></span> contrary. Failure, even the failure of
  knowledge, is triumph's evidence in these earlier days; and complete
  failure, the unchecked rule of evil in any form, is therefore
  impossible. We deny</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Recognized truths, obedient to some truth</p>

    <p>Unrecognized yet, but perceptible,&mdash;</p>

    <p>Correct the portrait by the living face,</p>

    <p>Man's God, by God's God in the mind of man."<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>The Ring and the Book&mdash;The Pope</i>, 1871-1874.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Thus the poet ever returns to the conception of God in the mind of
  man. God is the beginning and the end; and man is the self-conscious
  worker of God's will, the free process whereby the last which is
  first, returns to itself. The process, the growth, is man's life and
  being; and it falls within the ideal, which is eternal and all in
  all. The spiritual life of man, which is both intellectual and moral,
  is a dying into the eternal, not to cease to be in it, but to live in
  it more fully; for spirits necessarily commune. He dies to the
  temporal interests and narrow ends of the exclusive self, and lives
  an ever-expanding life in the life of others, manifesting more and
  more that spiritual principle which is the life of God, who lives and
  loves in all things. "God is a being in whom we exist; with whom we
  are in principle one; with whom the human spirit is identical, in the
  sense that He <i>is</i> all which the human spirit is capable of
  becoming."<sup>B</sup></p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>B: Green's <i>Prolegomena to Ethics</i>, p. 198.</p>
  </div>

  <p>From this point of view, and in so far as Browning <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg368" id="pg368">368</a></span> is loyal to the
  conception of the community of the divine and human, he is able to
  maintain his faith in God, not in spite of knowledge, but through the
  very movement of knowledge within him. He is not obliged, as in his
  later works, to look for proofs, either in nature, or elsewhere; nor
  to argue from the emotion of love in man, to a cause of that emotion.
  He needs no syllogistic process to arrive at God; for the very
  activity of his own spirit as intelligence, as the reason which
  thinks and acts, is the activity of God within him. Scepticism, is
  impossible, for the very act of doubting is the activity of reason,
  and a profession of the knowledge of the truth.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i14">"I</p>

    <p>Put no such dreadful question to myself,</p>

    <p>Within whose circle of experience burns</p>

    <p>The central truth, Power, Wisdom, Goodness,&mdash;God:</p>

    <p>I must outlive a thing ere know it dead:</p>

    <p>When I outlive the faith there is a sun,</p>

    <p>When I lie, ashes to the very soul,&mdash;</p>

    <p>Someone, not I, must wail above the heap,</p>

    <p>'He died in dark whence never morn arose.'"<sup>A</sup></p>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p>A: <i>The Ring and the Book&mdash;The Pope</i>, 1631-1639.</p>
  </div>

  <p>And this view of God as immanent in man's experience also
  forecloses all possibility of failure. Beneath the failure, the
  possibility of which is involved in a moral life, lies the divine
  element, working through contradiction to its own fulfilment. Failure
  is necessary for man, because he grows: but, for the same reason, the
  failure is not final. Thus, the poet, instead of denying the evidence
  of his intellect as to the existence of evil, or casting <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg369" id="pg369">369</a></span> doubt on the
  distinction between right and wrong, or reducing the chequered course
  of human history into a phantasmagoria of mere mental appearances,
  can regard the conflict between good and evil as real and earnest. He
  can look evil in the face, recognize its stubborn resistance to the
  good, and still regard the victory of the latter as sure and
  complete. He has not to reduce it into a phantom, or mere appearance,
  in order to give it a place within the divine order. He sees the
  night, but he also sees the day succeed it. Man falls into sin, but
  he cannot rest in it. It is contradictory to his nature, he cannot
  content himself with it, and he is driven through it. Mephistopheles
  promised more than he could perform, when he undertook to make Faust
  declare himself satisfied. There is not within the kingdom of evil
  what will satisfy the spirit of man, whose last law is goodness,
  whose nature, however obscured, is God's gift of Himself.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"While I see day succeed the deepest night&mdash;</p>

    <p>How can I speak but as I know?&mdash;my speech</p>

    <p>Must be, throughout the darkness. It will end:</p>

    <p>'The light that did burn, will burn!' Clouds obscure&mdash;</p>

    <p>But for which obscuration all were bright?</p>

    <p>Too hastily concluded! Sun&mdash;suffused,</p>

    <p>A cloud may soothe the eye made blind by blaze,&mdash;</p>

    <p>Better the very clarity of heaven:</p>

    <p>The soft streaks are the beautiful and dear.</p>

    <p>What but the weakness in a faith supplies</p>

    <p>The incentive to humanity, no strength</p>

    <p>Absolute, irresistible, comports?</p>

    <p>How can man love but what he yearns to help?</p>

    <p>And that which men think weakness within strength,</p>

    <p>But angels know for strength and stronger yet&mdash;</p>

    <p>What were it else but the first things made new,</p>

    <p>But repetition of the miracle,</p>

    <p>The divine instance of self-sacrifice</p>

    <p>That never ends and aye begins for man?</p>

    <p>So, never I miss footing in the maze,</p>

    <p>No,&mdash;I have light nor fear the dark at all."<sup>A</sup></p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
