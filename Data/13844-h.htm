  <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <h3>THE GREAT MRS. DE PEYSTER</h3>

  <p>It was a raw, ill-humored afternoon, yet too late in the
  spring for the ministration of steam heat, so the unseasonable
  May chill was banished from Mrs. De Peyster's sitting-room by a
  wood fire that crackled in the grate; crackled most decorously,
  be it added, for Mrs. De Peyster's fire would no more have
  forgotten itself and shown a boisterous enthusiasm than would one
  of her admirably trained servants. Beside a small steel safe,
  whose outer shell of exquisite cabinet-work transformed that
  fortress against burglarious desire into an article of furniture
  that harmonized with the comfortable elegance of a lady's
  boudoir, sat Mrs. De Peyster herself&mdash;she was born a De
  Peyster&mdash;carefully transferring her jewels from the trays of
  the safe to leathern cases. She looked quite as Mrs. De Peyster
  should have looked: with an aura of high dignity that a
  sixty-year-old dowager of the first water could not surpass, yet
  with a freshness of person that (had it not been for her dignity)
  might have made her early forties seem a blossomy
  thirty-five.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id=
  "page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>

  <p>Before the well-bred fire sat a lady whose tears had long
  since dried that she had shed when she had bid good-bye to
  thirty. She was&mdash;begging the lady's pardon&mdash;a trifle
  spare, and a trifle pale, and though in a manner well enough
  dressed her clothes had an air of bewilderment, of general
  irresolution, as though each article was uncertain in its mind as
  to whether it purposed to remain where it had been put, or
  casually wander away on blind and timorous adventures.</p>

  <p>A dozen years before, Mrs. De Peyster, then in the fifth year
  of her widowhood, had graciously undertaken to manage and
  underwrite the d&amp;#233;but of her second cousin (not of the
  main line, be it said) and had tried to discharge her duty in the
  important matter of securing her a husband. But her efforts had
  been futile, and to say that Mrs. De Peyster had not succeeded
  was to admit that poor Olivetta Harmon was indeed a failure. She
  had lacked the fortune to attract the conservative investor who
  is looking for a sound business proposition in her he promises to
  support; she had lacked the good looks to lure on the lover who
  throws himself romantically away upon a penniless pretty face;
  and she had not been clever enough to attract the man so
  irrationally bold as to set sail upon the sea of matrimony with a
  woman of brains. And so, her brief summer at an end, she had
  receded to those remote and undiscovered shores on which dwell
  the poor relations of the Four Hundred; whereon she had lived
  respectably, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id=
  "page3"></a>[pg 3]</span> as a lady (for that she should ever
  appear a lady was due the position of Mrs. De Peyster), upon an
  almost microscopic income; and from which bleak and distant land
  of second-cousindom she came in glad and proud obedience to fill
  an occasional vacant place at one of Mrs. De Peyster's
  second-best dinner parties.</p>

  <p>She had arrived but the moment before to bid her exalted
  cousin adieu and wish her <i>bon-voyage</i>, and was now silently
  gazing in unenvious admiration at the jewels Mrs. De Peyster was
  transferring to their traveling-cases&mdash;with never a guess
  that perturbation might exist beneath her kinswoman's composed
  exterior. As a matter of fact, under the trying circumstances
  which confronted Mrs. De Peyster, any other household would have
  been in confusion, any lesser woman might have been headed toward
  hysteria. But centuries of having had its own will had
  established the De Peyster habit of believing that things would
  eventuate according to the De Peyster wish; it was not in the De
  Peyster blood to give way. And yet, though self-control might
  restrain worry from the surface, it could not banish it from the
  private chambers of her being.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster glanced at the open door of her
  bedroom&mdash;hesitated&mdash;then called: "Miss Gardner!"</p>

  <p>A trim and pretty girl stepped in. "Yes, Mrs. De Peyster."</p>

  <p>"Will you please call up Judge Harvey's office <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span> once more,
  and inquire if there is any news about my son. And ask when Judge
  Harvey will be here."</p>

  <p>Miss Gardner crossed to Mrs. De Peyster's desk and took up the
  telephone.</p>

  <p>"Why, Cousin Caroline, has Jack&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One moment, Olivetta,"&mdash;motioning toward the
  telephone,&mdash;"until Miss Gardner is through."</p>

  <p>They sat silent until the receiver was hung up. Mrs. De
  Peyster strove to keep anxiety from her voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, Miss Gardner,&mdash;any trace of my son yet?"</p>

  <p>"They have learned nothing whatever."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;and Judge Harvey? When will he be here?"</p>

  <p>"His office said he was at a meeting of the directors of the
  New York and New England Railroad, and that he was coming here
  straight after the meeting."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Miss Gardner. You may now go on with the packing.
  I'll have the jewels ready very shortly, and Matilda will be in
  to help you as soon as she is through arranging with the
  servants."</p>

  <p>"Why, Cousin Caroline, what is it about Jack?" burst out
  Olivetta with an excited flutter after Miss Gardner had gone into
  the bedroom. "I hadn't heard anything of it before! Has&mdash;has
  anything happened to him?"</p>

  <p>Olivetta, an intimate, a relative, and a worshipful inferior,
  was one of the few persons with whom Mrs. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> De Peyster
  could bring herself to unbend and be confidential. "That is what
  I do not know. About a week ago Jack suddenly
  disappeared&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Disappeared!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he left a note, telling me not to worry. But not a word
  has been heard from him since. Of course, it may only be some
  wild escapade, but then he knew we were going on shipboard this
  evening, and he should have been home long before this."</p>

  <p>"How terrible!" cried the sympathetic Olivetta, pushing into
  place a few of the inconstant hairpins that threatened to bestrew
  the floor. "Went a week ago!" And then suddenly: "Why, that was
  about the time that first rumor was printed of his engagement to
  Ethel Quintard. And again this morning&mdash;in the
  'Record'&mdash;did you see it?"</p>

  <p>"I never give thought to the newspapers," was Mrs. De
  Peyster's somewhat stiff response.</p>

  <p>"You have&mdash;have told the police?"</p>

  <p>"The police, of course not! But I have advised with Judge
  Harvey, and he has a firm of private detectives on the case."</p>

  <p>"And they have clues?"</p>

  <p>"They have nothing, as you just heard Miss Gardner
  report."</p>

  <p>"Cousin Caroline! With all these&mdash;these thugs and hold-up
  men we read about&mdash;and all the accidents&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Olivetta! Don't!" And then in a more composed voice: "I am
  hoping it is merely some boyish <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> prank. But even that will be
  bad enough, if he misses the boat."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see. You told me about arranging with Mrs. Quintard
  also to sail on the Plutonia."</p>

  <p>"I had counted on the trip&mdash;Jack and Ethel being thrown
  together, you know."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, it was very clever of you!"</p>

  <p>"I am hoping it may be only some boyish prank," Mrs. De
  Peyster repeated. "You may not have noticed it, Olivetta," she
  continued, permitting a sigh to escape her, "but of late Jack has
  acted at times&mdash;well, rather queerly."</p>

  <p>"Queerly! How?"</p>

  <p>"He has been far from being himself. In fact, I have observed
  a number of things not at all natural to a De Peyster."</p>

  <p>"Caroline! What a worry he must be to you!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I am hoping for the best. And now, please, we will
  say no more about it."</p>

  <p>They were silent for a moment. Miss Gardner entered, took the
  jewels which in the mean time Mrs. De Peyster had finished
  putting in their cases, and went again into the bedroom.
  Olivetta's eyes followed her.</p>

  <p>"You are still pleased with Miss Gardner?"</p>

  <p>"Thus far she has proved herself competent. I consider myself
  very fortunate in finding a secretary who is not above some of
  the duties of a lady's maid. It is a very happy combination for
  traveling."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id=
  "page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>

  <p>"She seems almost too good to be true," mused Olivetta. "She's
  really very pretty. I hope Jack hasn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Olivetta! How can you! Jack has never paid her the slightest
  attention, nor she him."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, Caroline! But she's so pretty, and she's just the
  sort of girl who attracts men&mdash;and&mdash;and"&mdash;a bit
  wistfully&mdash;"gets engaged and gets married."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, Olivetta. When she first came to me I asked her if
  she were in love or engaged. She said she was not, and I told her
  my rules. She is a very sensible girl."</p>

  <p>"At any rate, she must be a great relief after that Marie you
  had."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster flushed, as though at some disagreeable
  memory.</p>

  <p>"Have you learned yet whether Marie was actually a spy for
  Mrs. Allistair?" inquired Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"She confessed that she was getting money besides the wages I
  paid her. That is proof enough."</p>

  <p>"I believe it of Mrs. Allistair! She wouldn't stop at anything
  to win your place as social leader. But she could never fill
  it!"</p>

  <p>"She will never win it!" Mrs. De Peyster returned with calm
  confidence.</p>

  <p>At that moment the door from the hallway opened and there
  entered a woman of middle age, in respectable dull-hued black,
  with apron of black silk and a white cap.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>

  <p>"Ah, Matilda," remarked Mrs. De Peyster. "The servants, are
  they all gone yet?"</p>

  <p>"The last one, the cook, is just going, ma'am. There's just
  William and me left. And the men have already come to board up
  the windows and the door."</p>

  <p>"You paid the servants board wages as I instructed, and made
  clear to them about coming to Newport when I send orders?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am. And they all understand."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Mrs. De Peyster. "You have Mr. Jack's trunks
  packed?"</p>

  <p>"All except a few things he may want to put in himself."</p>

  <p>"Very well. You may now continue helping Miss Gardner with my
  things."</p>

  <p>But Matilda did not obey. She trembled&mdash;blinked her
  eyes&mdash;choked; then stammered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Please, ma'am, there's&mdash;there's something else."</p>

  <p>"Something else?" queried Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am. Downstairs there are six or seven young men from
  the newspapers. They want&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Matilda," interrupted Mrs. De Peyster in stern reproof, "you
  are well enough acquainted with my invariable custom regarding
  reporters to have acted without referring this matter to me. It
  is a distinct annoyance," she added, "that one cannot make a
  single move without the newspapers following one!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed it is!" echoed the worshipful and indignant
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg
  9]</span> Olivetta. "But that is because of your position."</p>

  <p>"I tried to send them away," said Matilda hurriedly. "And I
  told them you were never interviewed. But," she ended helplessly,
  "it didn't do any good. They're all sitting downstairs
  waiting."</p>

  <p>"I shall not see them," Mrs. De Peyster declared firmly.</p>

  <p>"There was one," Matilda added timorously, "who drew me aside
  and whispered that he didn't want an interview. He wants your
  picture."</p>

  <p>"Wants my picture!" exclaimed Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am. He said the pictorial supplement of his paper a
  week from Sunday was going to have a page of pictures of
  prominent society women who were sailing for Europe. He said
  something about calling the page 'Annual Exodus of Social
  Leaders.' He wants to print that painting of you by that new
  foreign artist in the center of the page." And Matilda pointed
  above the fireplace to a gold-framed likeness of Mrs. De
  Peyster&mdash;stately, aloof, remote, of an ineffable composure,
  a masterpiece of blue-bloodedness.</p>

  <p>"You know my invariable custom; give him my invariable
  answer," was Mrs. De Peyster's crisp response.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, but&mdash;but, Cousin Caroline," put in Olivetta,
  with eager diffidence, "don't you think this is
  different?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id=
  "page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>

  <p>"Different?" asked Mrs. De Peyster. "How?"</p>

  <p>"This isn't at all like the ordinary offensive newspaper
  thing. A group of the most prominent social leaders, with you in
  the center of the page&mdash;with you in the center of them all,
  where you belong! Why, Caroline,&mdash;why&mdash;why&mdash;" In
  her excitement for the just glorification of her cousin,
  Olivetta's power of speech went fluttering from her.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it may not be quite the same," admitted Mrs. De
  Peyster. "But I see no reason for departing from my custom."</p>

  <p>"If not for your own sake, then&mdash;then for the artist's
  sake!" Olivetta pursued, a little more eagerly, and a little more
  of diffidence in her eagerness. "You have taken up M.
  Dubois&mdash;you have been his most distinguished
  patron&mdash;you have been trying to get him properly started. To
  have his picture displayed like that, think how it will help M.
  Dubois!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster gave Olivetta a sharp look, as though she
  questioned the entire disinterestedness of this argument; then
  she considered an instant; and in the main it was her human
  instinct to help a struggling fellow being that dictated her
  decision.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, you may give the man a photograph of the picture.
  And as I treat the papers without discrimination, you may give
  photographs to all the reporters who wish them. But on the
  understanding that M. Dubois is to have conspicuous credit."</p>

  <p>"Very well, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"And send all of them away."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>

  <p>"I'll do what I can, ma'am." And Matilda went out.</p>

  <p>"What time does the Plutonia sail?" inquired Olivetta, with
  the haste of one who is trying to get off of very thin ice.</p>

  <p>"At one to-night. Matilda will get me a bit of dinner and I
  shall go aboard right after it."</p>

  <p>"How many times does this make that you've been over?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," Mrs. De Peyster answered carelessly. "Thirty
  or forty, I dare say."</p>

  <p>Olivetta's face was wistful with unenvious envy. "Oh, what a
  pleasure!"</p>

  <p>"Going to Europe, Olivetta, is hardly a pleasure," corrected
  Mrs. De Peyster. "It is a duty one owes one's social
  position."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know that's true with you, Cousin Caroline. But with
  me&mdash;what a joy! When you took me over with you that summer,
  we only did the watering-places. But now"&mdash;a note of
  ecstatic desire came into her voice, and she clasped her
  hands&mdash;"but now, to see Paris!&mdash;the Louvre!&mdash;the
  Luxembourg! It's the dream of my life!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster again gave her cousin a suspicious look.</p>

  <p>"Olivetta, have you been allowing M. Dubois to pay you any
  more attention?"</p>

  <p>"No, no,&mdash;of course not," cried Olivetta, and a sudden
  color tinted the too-early autumn of her cheeks. "Do you think,
  after what you said&mdash;"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>

  <p>"M. Dubois is a very good artist, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I understand, Cousin Caroline," Olivetta put in hastily. "I
  think too much of your position to think of such a thing. Since
  you&mdash;since then&mdash;I have not spoken to him, and have
  only bowed to him once."</p>

  <p>"We will say no more about it," returned Mrs. De Peyster; and
  she kissed Olivetta with her duchess-like kindness. "By the by,
  my dear, your comb is on the floor."</p>

  <p>"So it is. It's always falling out."</p>

  <p>Olivetta picked it up, put it into place, and with nervous
  hands tried to press into order loose-flying locks of her rather
  scanty hair.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster arose; her worry about her missing son
  prompted her to seek the relief of movement. "I think I shall
  take a turn about the house to see that everything is being
  properly closed. Would you like to come with me?"</p>

  <p>Olivetta would; and, talking, they went together down the
  stairs. As they neared the ground floor, Matilda's voice arose to
  them, expostulating, protesting.</p>

  <p>"What can that be about?" wondered Mrs. De Peyster, and
  following the voice toward its source she stepped into her
  reception-room. Instantly there sprang up and stood before her a
  young man with the bland, smiling, excessively polite manner of a
  gentleman-brigand. And around her crowded five or six other
  figures.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id=
  "page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>

  <p>Matilda, pressing through them, glared at these invaders in
  helpless wrath, then at her mistress in guilty terror.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I did my best, ma'am. But they wouldn't go." And
  before punishment could fall she discreetly fled.</p>

  <p>"Pardon this seeming intrusion, Mrs. De Peyster," the foremost
  young man said rapidly, smoothly, appeasingly. "But we could not
  go, as you requested. The sailing of Mrs. De Peyster, under the
  attendant circumstances, is a piece of news of first importance;
  in fact, almost a national event. We simply had to see you. I
  trust you perceive and appreciate our professional
  predicament."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster was glaring at him with devastating
  majesty.</p>

  <p>"This&mdash;this is an outrage!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it may seem an outrage to you," said the young man
  swiftly, politely, and thoroughly undevastated. "But, really, it
  is only our duty. Our duty to our papers, and to the great
  reading public. And when newspaper men are doing their duty they
  must necessarily fail, to their great personal regret, in the
  observance of some of the nicer courtesies."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster was almost inarticulate.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Mayfair is my name. Of the 'Record.'"</p>

  <p>"The 'Record'! That yellow, radical paper!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mayfair stepped nearer. His voice sank to an easy,
  confidential tone.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id=
  "page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>

  <p>"You are misled by appearances, Mrs. De Peyster. Every paper
  has got to have a policy; we're the common people's
  paper&mdash;big circulation, you know; and we so denounce the
  rich on our editorial page. But as a matter of fact we give our
  readers more live, entertaining, and respectful matter about
  society people than any other paper in New York. It's just what
  the common people love. And now"&mdash;easily shifting his
  base&mdash;"about this reported engagement of your son and Miss
  Quintard. As you know, it's the best 'romance in high life' story
  of the season. Will you either confirm or deny the report?"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing whatever to say," flamed out Mrs. De Peyster.
  "And will you leave this house instantly!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, Miss Quintard's mother would not deny it either,"
  commented Mr. Mayfair with his polite imperturbability. His sharp
  eyes glinted with satisfaction. Young Mr. Mayfair admired himself
  as being something of the human dynamo. Also it was his private
  opinion that he was of the order of the super-reporter; nothing
  ever "got by him." "And so," he went on without a pause, "since
  the engagement is not denied, I suppose we may take it as a fact.
  And now"&mdash;again with his swift change of base&mdash;"may I
  ask, as a parting word before you sail, whether it is your
  intention next season to contest with Mrs. Allistair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing whatever to say!"</p>

  <p>"Quite naturally you'd prefer not to say anything,"
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg
  15]</span> appeasingly continued the high-geared Mr. Mayfair,
  "but of course you are going to fight her." Again his sharp,
  unfoilable eyes glinted. "'Duel for social
  leadership'&mdash;pardon me for speaking of it as such, but
  that's what it is; and most interesting, I assure you; and I, for
  one, trust that you will retain your supremacy, for I
  know&mdash;<i>I know</i>," he repeated with emphasis&mdash;"that
  Mrs. Allistair has used some methods not
  altogether&mdash;sportsmanlike, may I say? And now"&mdash;rapidly
  shifting once more&mdash;"I trust I will not seem indelicate if I
  inquire whether it is in the scope of your present plans, perhaps
  at house-parties at the estates of titled friends, to meet the
  Duke de&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing whatever to say!" gasped Mrs. De Peyster,
  glaring with consuming fury.</p>

  <p>"Naturally. We could hardly expect a categorical 'yes' or
  'no.' We understand that your position requires you to be
  non-committal; and you, of course, understand that we newspaper
  men interpret a refusal to speak as an answer in the affirmative.
  Thank you very much for the interview you have given us. And I
  can assure you that we shall all handle the story with the utmost
  good taste. Good afternoon."</p>

  <p>He bowed. And the next moment the place where he had stood was
  vacant.</p>

  <p>"Of&mdash;of all the effrontery!" exploded Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it terrible!" shudderingly gasped the <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>
  sympathetic Olivetta. "I hope they won't really drag in that
  horrible Duke de Cr&amp;#233;cy!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster shuddered, too. The episode of the Duke de
  Cr&amp;#233;cy was still salt in an unhealed social wound. The
  Duke had been New York's most distinguished titled visitor the
  previous winter; Mrs. De Peyster, to the general envy, had led in
  his entertainment; there had been whispers of another
  international marriage. And then, after respectful adieus, the
  Duke had sailed away&mdash;and within a month the papers were
  giving columns to his scandalous escapades with a sensational
  Spanish dancer of parsimonious drapery. Whereupon the rumors of
  Mrs. De Peyster's previously gossiped-of marriage with the now
  notorious Duke were revived&mdash;by the subtle instigation, and
  as an act of social warfare, so Mrs. De Peyster believed, of her
  aspiring rival, Mrs. Allistair. And there was one faint rumor,
  still daringly breathed around, that the Duke had
  proposed&mdash;had been accepted&mdash;had run away: in blunt
  terms, had jilted Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"We will not speak of this again, Olivetta," Mrs. De Peyster
  remarked with returning dignity, "but while the matter is up, I
  will mention that the Duke did propose to me, and that I refused
  him."</p>

  <p>With a gesture she silenced any comment from Olivetta. In a
  breath or two she was entirely her usual poiseful self. Too many
  generations had her blood been trained to ways of dignity, and
  too long had she herself been drilled in composure and
  self-esteem <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id=
  "page17"></a>[pg 17]</span> and in a perfect confidence in the
  thing that she was, for an invasion of newspaper creatures to
  disturb her for longer than a few moments.</p>

  <p>She was moving with stately tread toward the dining-room when
  Matilda came hurrying up from the nether regions of the house.
  "Did you know, ma'am," Matilda fluttered eagerly, "that Mr. Jack
  is home?"</p>

  <p>"My son back!" There was vast relief in Mrs. De Peyster's
  voice. "When did he come?"</p>

  <p>"A few minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"Did&mdash;did he say anything?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen him, ma'am. He came in the back way, through
  the stable. William told me about it."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster's voice became composed, severe. "I shall see
  what he has to say for himself." Majestically, somewhat
  ominously, she turned and began to mount the stairs, followed by
  Olivetta and Matilda. But as she passed the library's closed
  door, she heard Miss Gardner's voice and a second voice&mdash;and
  the second voice was the voice of a man.</p>

  <p>Startled, she paused. She caught a few fragments of phrases.
  Indignation surged up within her. Resolutely she stepped to the
  door; but by instinct she was no eavesdropper, and she would not
  come upon people in compromising attitudes without giving them
  fair warning. So she knocked, waited a moment&mdash;then opened
  the door and entered.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"

  <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <h3>ENTER AN AMIABLE YOUNG GENTLEMAN</h3>

  <p>Half an hour earlier, across in Washington Square, a young
  gentleman was sauntering about taking the crisp May air. He was
  fashionably but quietly dressed, and in his chamois-gloved hand
  he swung a jaunty wand of a cane; a slender, lithe young
  gentleman, with a keen face that had an oddly wide but yet
  attractive mouth: a young man emanating an essence of lightness
  both of body and of spirit. He might have been the very person of
  agreeable, irresponsible Spring, if Spring is ever of the male
  gender, out for a promenade.</p>

  <p>It seemed most casual, the saunter of this pleasant idler; the
  keenest observer would never have guessed purpose in his stroll.
  But never for longer than an instant were the frank gray eyes of
  this young gentleman away from the splendid stone steps, with
  their carved balustrade, and the fine old doorway of Mrs. De
  Peyster's house at No. 13 Washington Square.</p>

  <p>Presently he noted three men turn up Mrs. De Peyster's steps.
  Swiftly, but without noticeable haste, he was across the street.
  The trio had no more than touched the bell when he was beside
  them.</p>

  <p>"What papers are you boys with?" he inquired easily, merging
  himself at once with the party.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>

  <p>One man told him&mdash;and looked him up and down. "Thought I
  knew all the fellows," added the speaker, a middle-aged man, "but
  never ran into you before. What's your rag?"</p>

  <p>"'Town Gossip,'" replied the agreeable young gentleman.</p>

  <p>"'Town Gossip'!" The old reporter gave a grunt of contempt.
  "And you've come to interview Mrs. De Peyster?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"First time I ever knew that leprous scandal-scavenger and
  black-hander to send a man out in the open to get a story."
  Evidently the old reporter, whom the others addressed as
  "colonel," had by his long service acquired the privilege of
  surly out-spokenness. "Thought 'Town Gossip' specialized in
  butlers and ladies' maids and such&mdash;or faked up its dope in
  the office."</p>

  <p>"This is something special." The young gentleman's smiling but
  unpresuming <i>camaraderie</i> seemed unruffled by the colonel's
  blunt contempt, and though they all drew apart from him he seemed
  to be untroubled by his journalistic ostracism.</p>

  <p>The next moment the door was opened by a stout, short-breathed
  woman, hat, jacket, and black gloves on. All stepped in. The
  three late-arriving reporters, seeing in the reception-room
  beyond a group of newspapermen about a servant,&mdash;Matilda
  making her first futile effort to rid the house of this
  pestilential horde, generaled by Mr. Mayfair,&mdash;started
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg
  20]</span> quickly toward the members of their fraternity. But
  the young gentleman remained behind with their stout
  admitter.</p>

  <p>"Huh&mdash;thought that was really your size&mdash;tackling a
  servant!" commented the caustic colonel.</p>

  <p>But the reporter from "Town Gossip" smiled and did not reply;
  and the three disappeared into the reception-room. The young
  gentleman, very politely, half pushed, half followed the stout
  woman out of the reception-room's range of vision.</p>

  <p>"Just leaving, I suppose," he remarked with pleasant
  matter-of-factness.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. My bags are down at the basement door. When I heard
  the ring, I just happened&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I understand. You wouldn't have answered the door, if almost
  all the regular servants had not been gone. Now, I'd say,"
  smiling engagingly, "that you might be the cook, and a mighty
  good cook, too."</p>

  <p>He had such an "air," did this young man,&mdash;the human air
  of the real gentleman,&mdash;that, despite the unexpectedness of
  his overture, the stout woman, instead of taking offense, flushed
  with pleasure.</p>

  <p>"I ought to be a good one, sir; that's what I'm paid for."</p>

  <p>"Seventy-five a month?" estimated the young gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Eighty," corrected the cook.</p>

  <p>"That's mighty good&mdash;twenty dollars a week. But, Mrs.
  Cook,"&mdash;again with his open, engaging smile,&mdash;"pardon
  me for not knowing your proper <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> name,&mdash;could I
  induce you to enter my employment&mdash;at, say, twenty dollars a
  minute?"</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For only a limited period," continued the young
  gentleman&mdash;"to be exact, say one minute. Light work," he
  added with a certain whimsicality, "short hours, seven days
  out&mdash;unusual opportunity."</p>

  <p>"But what&mdash;what am I to do?" gasped the cook, and before
  she could gasp again one surprised black glove was clutching two
  ten-dollar bills.</p>

  <p>"Arrange for me to see Miss Gardner&mdash;alone. It's all
  right. She and I are old friends."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but how?" helplessly inquired this mistress of all
  non-intrigantes.</p>

  <p>"Isn't there some room where nobody will come in?"</p>

  <p>"The library might be best, sir," pointing up the stairway at
  a door.</p>

  <p>"The library, then! And arrange matters so that no one will
  know we're meeting."</p>

  <p>"But, sir, I don't see how&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Most simple, Mrs. Cook. Before you go, you, of course, want
  to bid Miss Gardner good-bye. Just request the lady in black in
  there with the reporters to tell Miss Gardner that you want to
  speak to her and will be waiting in the library. When you've said
  that, you've earned the money. Then just watch your chance until
  the somber lady isn't looking, and continue with your original
  plan of leaving the house."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>

  <p>"Perhaps it will work," hesitated the cook. But with a gesture
  in which there was no hesitation she slipped her minute's pay
  between the buttons of her waist.</p>

  <p>The young gentleman went lightly and swiftly up the stairs and
  through the mahogany door that had been pointed out to him.
  Curiously he looked about the spacious, dark-toned room of
  splendid dignity. He had the ease of the man to whom the world is
  home, and seemed not one whit abashed by the exclusive grandeur
  of the great chamber. With a watchful eye on the door, he glanced
  at the rows and rows of volumes: well-bred authors whom time had
  elevated to a place among literary "old families." Also he
  examined some old Chinese ivory carvings with a critical,
  valuating, meditative eye. Also in passing&mdash;and this he did
  absently, as one might do from habit&mdash;he tried the knob of a
  big safe, but it was locked.</p>

  <p>The next moment there was a sound at the door. Instantly he
  was out of sight behind the brown velvet hangings of a recessed
  French window. Miss Gardner entered, saw upon the embarrassed
  edges of none of the shrouded chairs a plump and short-breathed
  Susan. Surprised, she was turning to leave when a cautious but
  clear whisper floated across the room.</p>

  <p>"Clara!"</p>

  <p>She whirled about. At sight of the young gentleman, who had
  stepped forth, she went pale, then red, then pale
  again.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id=
  "page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>

  <p>"Eliot&mdash;Mr. Bradford!" she exclaimed. Then in a husky
  frightened whisper: "How did you get in here?"</p>

  <p>He sought to take one of her hands, but she put both behind
  her back. At this repulse the young gentleman winced, then smiled
  gravely, then pleasantly,&mdash;and then with a whimsical upward
  twist to his wide mouth.</p>

  <p>"Via the cook," he answered, and told her the rest.</p>

  <p>"Did any one else belonging to the house see you?"</p>

  <p>"Besides you and my excellent old friend, the cook, no
  one."</p>

  <p>"But don't you realize that this house is one of the most
  dangerous places in the world for you?" she cried in a low voice.
  "Why, Judge Harvey himself is expected here any minute!"</p>

  <p>"Judge Harvey!" The equable young man gave a start. But the
  next moment his poise came back.</p>

  <p>"And after what I saw only to-day in the papers about Thomas
  Preston&mdash;! Don't you know you are this moment standing on a
  volcano?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but what of it?" he answered cheerfully. "It's the
  most diverting indoor or outdoor sport I've ever indulged
  in&mdash;dodging eruptions. Besides, in standing on this volcano
  I have the advantage of also standing near you."</p>

  <p>"Didn't I tell you I never wanted to see you again!" she
  flamed at him. "How dared you come here?"</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>

  <p>"I had to come, dear." His voice was pleading, yet
  imperturbably pleasant. "You refused to answer the letters I
  wrote you begging you to meet me somewhere to talk things over. I
  read that Mrs. De Peyster was sailing to-night, and I knew that
  you were sailing with her. Surely you understand, before she
  went, I had to see my wife."</p>

  <p>"I refuse to recognize myself as such!" cried Miss
  Gardner.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear, you married&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, after knowing you just two days! Oh, you can be charming
  and plausible, but that shows just how foolish a girl can be when
  she's a bit tired and lonesome, and then gets a bit of a
  holiday."</p>

  <p>"But, Clara, you really liked me!"</p>

  <p>"That was because I didn't know who you were and what you
  were!"</p>

  <p>"But, Clara," he went on easily&mdash;he could not help
  talking easily, though his tone had the true ring of sincerity.
  There seemed to be no bit of agressive self-assurance about this
  young gentleman; he seemed to be just quietly, pleasantly,
  whimsically, unsubduably his natural self. "But, Clara, you must
  remember that it was as sudden with me as with you. I hardly
  thought about explaining. And then, I'll be frank, I was afraid
  if I did tell, you wouldn't have me. I did side-step a bit,
  that's a fact."</p>

  <p>"You admit this, and yet you expect me to accept as my husband
  a man who admits he is a crook!"</p>

  <p>"My dear Clara," he protested gently, "I never <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>
  admitted I was such an undraped, uneuphonious, square-cornered
  word as that."</p>

  <p>"Well, if a forger isn't a crook, then who is? The business of
  those forged letters of Thomas Jefferson, do you think I can
  stand for that?"</p>

  <p>The young man was in earnest, deadly earnest; yet he could not
  help his wide mouth tilting slightly upward to the right. Plainly
  there was something here that amused him.</p>

  <p>"But, Clara, you don't seem to understand that
  business&mdash;and you don't seem to understand me."</p>

  <p>"No, I must say I don't!" she said caustically.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps I can't blame you," he admitted soothingly,
  "for I don't always understand myself. But really, my dear,
  you're not seeing this in the right light. Oh, I'm not going to
  defend myself. It's sad, very sad, but I'll confess I'm no chromo
  of sweet and haloed rectitude to be held up for the encouragement
  and beatification of young John D. Rockefeller's Bible Class.
  Still, I get my living quite as worthily as many of the guests
  who grace"&mdash;with a light wave of his hand about the great
  chamber&mdash;"this noble habitation. Though," in a grieved tone,
  "I'll confess some of my methods are not yet adequately
  recognized and protected by law."</p>

  <p>"Won't you ever take anything seriously?" she cried in
  exasperation.</p>

  <p>"Besides yourself, what is there to take
  seriously?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id=
  "page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>

  <p>"Don't consider me in your calculations, if you please!" And
  then with sudden suspicion: "See here&mdash;you're not here to
  try any of your tricks on this house, or on Mrs. De Peyster!"</p>

  <p>"I was thinking," said he, smiling about the room, "that you
  might hide me here till the police become infatuated with some
  other party. A fashionable house closed for the
  summer&mdash;nothing could possibly be superior for my
  purposes."</p>

  <p>"I'd never do it! Besides, Mrs. De Peyster's housekeeper will
  be here."</p>

  <p>"But Mrs. De Peyster's housekeeper would never know I was
  here."</p>

  <p>"I can't stand your talk another minute," she burst out.
  "Go!"</p>

  <p>He did not stir; continued to smile at her pleasantly. "Oh,
  I'm not really asking the favor, Clara. I'm pretty safe where I'm
  staying."</p>

  <p>"Go, I say! And if you don't care for your own danger, then at
  least consider mine."</p>

  <p>"Yours?"</p>

  <p>"I've told you of Mrs. De Peyster's attitude toward
  married&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then leave her, my dear. Even though it wouldn't be safe for
  you to be with me till the police resume their interrupted
  nap&mdash;still, you can have your own flat and your own bank
  account. Nothing would make me happier."</p>

  <p>"Understand this, Mr. Bradford,&mdash;I'm going to have
  nothing to do with you!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>

  <p>For a moment he sobered. "Come, Clara: give me a chance to
  make good&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you turn straight?" she caught him up sharply. "And will
  you fix up the affair of the Jefferson letters?"</p>

  <p>"That last is a pretty stiff proposition; I don't see how it's
  to be done. As to the first&mdash;but, really,
  Clara,"&mdash;smiling again appeasingly,&mdash;"really, you take
  this thing altogether too seriously."</p>

  <p>"Too seriously!" She almost choked. "Why&mdash;why&mdash;I'm
  through with you! That's final! And I don't dare stay here
  another minute! Good-bye."</p>

  <p>"Wait, Clara." He caught her hand as she turned to go, and
  spoke rapidly. "I don't think I'm so bad as you think I
  am&mdash;honest. You may change your mind; I hope you do, dear;
  and if you do, write me, 'phone me, telegraph me, cable me,
  wireless me. But, of course, not to me direct; the police, you
  know. Address me in care of the Reverend Mr. Pyecroft." Tense
  though the moment was to him, the young man could not restrain
  his odd whimsical smile. "The Reverend Mr. Pyecroft has taken an
  interest in me; like you he is trying to make me a better man.
  He'll see that I get your message. Herbert E.
  Pyecroft&mdash;P-y-e-c-r-o-f-t&mdash;remember his name. Here's a
  card of the boarding-house at which he is staying." He thrust the
  bit of pasteboard into her free hand. "Remember, dear, I really
  am your husband."</p>

  <p>With an outraged gesture she flung the card to the
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg
  28]</span> floor. "There'll be no message!" Her voice was raised;
  she trembled in fierce humiliation, and in scorn of him. "You ...
  my husband!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, your husband!" he said firmly. "And I'm going to make
  you love me!"</p>

  <p>It was at just this moment that Mrs. De Peyster, ascending
  from her scene with the reporters, was passing without, and it
  was these last words that she overheard. And it was at just this
  moment that her knock sounded upon the door.</p>

  <p>"Quick, you mustn't be seen here!" breathed Miss Gardner. "The
  French windows there, and out the back way through the
  stable!"</p>

  <p>With a cat's silent swiftness he was at the windows, Miss
  Gardner beside him. But in the back-yard stood William, the
  coachman, sunning himself. That way was closed.</p>

  <p>"Into the study," whispered Miss Gardner, pointing at a door,
  "and watch your chance to get out!"</p>

  <p>In the same instant the heavy sound-proof mahogany door closed
  softly behind him&mdash;leaving Miss Gardner in the middle of the
  room, with heightened color, breathing rapidly. Into the library
  swept Mrs. De Peyster, followed by Olivetta and Matilda.</p>

  <p>There was a lofty sternness in Mrs. De Peyster's manner. "Miss
  Gardner, I believe I heard you speaking with a man."</p>

  <p>"You did." Miss Gardner was stiff, proudly erect, for she
  sensed what might be coming.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"He went out through the window," said Miss Gardner.</p>

  <p>"Ah, he did not want me to find out about you. But by chance I
  overheard him say he was your husband."</p>

  <p>"He is." Then with an effort: "But husband or no husband, Mrs.
  De Peyster, I believe I would be of equal value&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I desire no scene, no argument," interrupted Mrs. De Peyster,
  dignified, not a strident note in her voice&mdash;for she never
  lost her self-possession or the true grand manner. "I believe you
  will remember, Miss Gardner, that when you applied for your
  present position two months ago, I told you that I made it a rule
  to have no servants or employees of any kind who were married. As
  I desired that you should understand my reasons, I informed you
  that I had once had a cook and a footman who were married, and
  who paid so much attention to one another that they had time to
  pay no attention to me. I then asked you if you were married. You
  informed me you were not."</p>

  <p>"And I was not, at that time."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Then you have married since. That makes your
  deception all the worse. Remember, Miss Gardner, it was on the
  distinct understanding that you were unmarried that I employed
  you. I have no desire to pass judgment upon you. I try to be fair
  and just and generous with all my employees. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span> If you
  had been what you declared yourself to be, and remained such, you
  could have stayed with me indefinitely. Matilda there came to me
  as my son's nurse over twenty years ago, and has been with me
  ever since&mdash;happy, as she will tell you, with no desire to
  change her state whatever."</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;no&mdash;none&mdash;none at all!"</p>

  <p>Matilda hastily dropped her eyes. Mechanically her eyes noted
  the rejected card Mr. Bradford had tendered Miss Gardner. Her
  long habit of perfect orderliness, and perhaps the impulse to
  hide the slight confusion that suddenly had seized upon her,
  prompted her to bend over and secure this bit of litter. She
  glanced at it, would have put it in the waste-basket had that
  receptacle not been across the room, then thrust it into the
  capacious slit-pocket of her black skirt.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster continued in her tone of exact justice: "Miss
  Gardner, you have the perfect right to be married or unmarried. I
  have the perfect right to have the sort of employees I prefer.
  But since you are not what you declared yourself to be, I no
  longer require your service."</p>

  <p>Miss Gardner bowed stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, see that Miss Gardner is paid in full to the end of
  her month; and also pay her one month in advance. And telephone
  about until you can find me a maid&mdash;do not bother about the
  secretary part of it&mdash;a maid who is <i>not</i> married, and
  who can come at once. That is all."</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>

  <p>Matilda, still somewhat pale and agitated, started to follow
  out the proud Miss Gardner, who gave a swift glance at the study
  door&mdash;while Mrs. De Peyster looked on with her invariable
  calm majesty.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id=

  <h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <h3>MISTRESS OF HER HOUSE</h3>

  <p>But at just this moment there was a smart rap at the library
  door, it was partly opened, and a cheery masculine voice called
  out:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"May I come in, mother?"</p>

  <p>"You, Jack. You may," was the somewhat eager response from
  Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>The door swung entirely open, Miss Gardner stepped out, and
  there entered a young man of twenty-two or three, good-natured
  confidence in his manner, flawlessly dressed, with hands that
  were swathed in bandages. He crossed limpingly to Mrs. De
  Peyster, who, her affection now under control, stood regarding
  him with reproving and sternly questioning eyes.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, mother,&mdash;glad to get back," he said,
  imprinting an undaunted kiss upon her stately cheek.</p>

  <p>Her reply was a continuance of her reproving look. The young
  man turned to Mrs. De Peyster's faithful satellite.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Olivetta. Hands out of commission. You'll have to
  shake my elbow." And he held out his angled arm.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Jack," responded Olivetta, in <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>
  trepidation, hardly daring to be gracious where Mrs. De Peyster
  had been cool.</p>

  <p>Jack slipped an arm across Matilda's shoulders. "How are you,
  Matilda? Glad to see you again."</p>

  <p>"And I'm glad to see you again, Mr. Jack," returned Matilda,
  with a look of stealthy affection.</p>

  <p>"Please go, Matilda," said Mrs. De Peyster crisply. "And now,
  Jack," she continued with frigid dignity after Matilda had
  withdrawn, "I trust that you will explain your absence, and your
  long silence."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, mother," said Jack, pushing a slip-covered chair
  before the fireplace&mdash;for an open wood fire burned here as
  in her sitting-room above&mdash;and letting himself down into the
  chair slowly and with extreme care and crossing his legs. "I got
  a sudden invitation from Reggie Atwater to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You know I do not approve of that young scape-grace!"</p>

  <p>"I know you don't. I suppose that's one reason I didn't tell
  you beforehand what I was up to."</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing?"</p>

  <p>"Reggie asked me to go on a long trip to try out his new car.
  It's a hummer. Hundred-and-twenty horse-power&mdash;bloody-eyed,
  fire-spitting devil&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Such cars are dangerous," severely commented Mrs. De Peyster,
  who still kept to her horses and carriage as better maintaining
  old-family distinction.</p>

  <p>"I know. That's another reason I didn't tell
  you&mdash;especially since we were planning a thousand-mile
  lark."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id=
  "page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>

  <p>"What's the matter with your hands?" suddenly demanded Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>Jack gazed meditatively at the bandaged members.</p>

  <p>"You were right about that car being dangerous, mother," said
  he. "I'll confess the whole business. We were whizzing around a
  corner coming into Yonkers this morning when the machine skidded.
  I did a loop-the-loop and lit on my hands. But the skin of my
  palms&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" shuddered Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"Were you much hurt?" asked Mrs. De Peyster, for a moment
  forgetting her reproving manner in her affectionate concern.</p>

  <p>"Mother, with your love for old lace, you certainly would like
  the openwork effect of my skin. But&mdash;the patient will
  recover."</p>

  <p>"I trust this experience has been a lesson to you!" said Mrs.
  De Peyster with returned severity.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it has&mdash;a big lesson!" Jack heartily agreed.</p>

  <p>"Then I trust you will do nothing of the kind again."</p>

  <p>"I trust I won't have to!"</p>

  <p>There was rather an odd quality in Jack's tone.</p>

  <p>"Won't have to? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"You've questioned me a lot, mother. I'd like to put a few
  leading questions to you. And&mdash;u'm&mdash;alone. Olivetta,"
  he remarked pleasantly, "do you know that Sherlock Holmes found
  it an instructive and valuable occupation to count the
  stair-steps in a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id=
  "page35"></a>[pg 35]</span> house? Suppose you run out for five
  minutes and count 'em. I'll bet you a box of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Olivetta had risen, somewhat indignantly.</p>

  <p>"I never eat candy!"</p>

  <p>"A box of hairpins," continued Jack, clumsily picking up one
  from the floor, "that there aren't more than seventy-five."</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you want me out of the way, all right!" said Olivetta,
  sticking the pin into place.</p>

  <p>"Here, is that your purse?" asked Jack, fishing an open purse
  from beneath the chair Olivetta had just vacated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm always dropping it. I lost two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I must say, Olivetta," put in Mrs. De Peyster reprovingly,
  "that you really must not be so careless!"</p>

  <p>Jack was looking at a card that had fallen from the purse.</p>

  <p>"Hello! And a ticket to the exhibition of paintings
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Give it to me!" And Olivetta, with suddenly crimson face,
  snatched purse and card from Jack's hands. "I'll wait up in your
  bedroom, Caroline, and look at your new gowns." And with a
  rapidity that approached instantaneity she disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Jack," his mother demanded suspiciously, "what was that
  card?"</p>

  <p>"Just an old admission ticket to varnishing day at the spring
  exhibit of the American Society of Painters," said Jack easily.
  And without giving Mrs. De Peyster an instant in which to pursue
  the matter <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id=
  "page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> further, he awkwardly pushed her
  favorite chair toward the fire to a place beside his own. "Come
  sit down, mother. There's a lot of things I want to tell
  you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster lowered herself into the chair. "Yes?"</p>

  <p>Jack's eyes had meditatively followed Olivetta. "Do you know,
  mother, that Olivetta would really be an awfully good sort if she
  only had the right chance?"</p>

  <p>"The right chance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Think of her living on and on in that deadly proper
  little hotel&mdash;chuck full of primped and crimped and proud
  poor relations who don't dare draw a single full-sized breath
  without first considering whether such a daring act might not
  disturb the social standing of somebody over on Fifth Avenue or
  down here on Washington Square&mdash;Oh, I say, mother, five more
  years of that life and Olivetta will be
  choked&mdash;dessicated&mdash;salted away&mdash;a regular
  forever-and-ever-amen old maid. But if&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;if?"</p>

  <p>"If Olivetta were only to marry some one&mdash;some decent
  fellow&mdash;she'd blossom out, grow as young as she actually
  is&mdash;and, who knows, perhaps even her hairpins might stay
  in."</p>

  <p>"Marry, yes. But whom?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen a few things&mdash;there's a certain
  party&mdash;and&mdash;" He stumbled a bit, conscious that he was
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg
  37]</span> becoming indiscreet. "And, oh, well, just on general
  principles marriage is a good thing."</p>

  <p>"That is just the opinion I have been urging upon you in
  regard to yourself," returned his mother in her even, confident
  tone.</p>

  <p>"U'm&mdash;yes," Jack said hastily. "But that was
  not&mdash;not the first thing I wanted to speak about."</p>

  <p>"I believe you did say there were several matters."</p>

  <p>"So there are." He rubbed his face tentatively with his
  bandaged hand; then smiled blandly at his mother. "Yes, there are
  a few."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well, first of all, mother, I want to make a kick."</p>

  <p>She frowned. "How often must I request you not to use such
  common expressions!"</p>

  <p>"All right, all right," said he. "Suppose I say, then, that
  I'm dissatisfied."</p>

  <p>"Dissatisfied!" She straightened up. "Dissatisfied! What
  about? Do I not allow you all the money you want?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And have I not practically arranged a match between you and
  Ethel Quintard? Ethel will have three millions some day. And
  there is no better family to marry into; that is, except our
  own."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes,&mdash;I know."</p>

  <p>"And yet you say you are dissatisfied!" She stared. "What more
  can you want?"</p>

  <p>"Well, for one thing, to go to school," was Jack's amiable
  response.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id=
  "page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>

  <p>"Go to school! Why&mdash;why, you've already had the best of
  educations! Exeter&mdash;Yale&mdash;not to speak of private
  tutors!"</p>

  <p>"And what did I learn? That is," he added, "over and above
  being a fairly decent half-back and learning how to spend
  money&mdash;u'm&mdash;pretty thoroughly."</p>

  <p>"I trust," said Mrs. De Peyster with all her dignity, "that
  you learned to be a gentleman!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose I learned that all right," Jack acquiesced.
  "And I've been working hard at the profession ever
  since&mdash;sixteen to twenty hours a day, no half-holidays and
  no Sundays off. I can't stand it any longer. So I've decided to
  go on strike."</p>

  <p>"Strike?" exclaimed his mother, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Yes. For better conditions. I'm tired loafing such long
  hours. I'd like a little leisure in which to work."</p>

  <p>"Work!" repeated his mother&mdash;and human voice could hardly
  express amazement greater than did hers. "Work! Jack&mdash;you're
  not in earnest?"</p>

  <p>He held upon her a clear-eyed, humorous, but resolute
  face.</p>

  <p>"Don't I look in earnest?"</p>

  <p>He did; and his mother could only dazedly repeat, "Work! You
  go to work!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not at once. No, thank you! I want to ask you to give me
  a little proper education first that will equip me to do
  something. You've spent&mdash;how much have you spent on my
  education, mother? <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id=
  "page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> Tens and tens of thousands, I know.
  Pretty big investment, on the whole. Now, how large returns do
  you suppose I can draw on that investment?"</p>

  <p>"I was not thinking about dividends; I was thinking about
  fitting you for your station," returned his mother stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Well, as for me, I've been thinking of late about how much I
  could get out of that investment. I've wanted to test myself and
  find what I was worth&mdash;as a worker." He leaned a little
  closer. "I say, mother," he said confidentially, "you remember
  that little explanation I just gave you of my absence."</p>

  <p>"About your trip in that high-powered automobile?"</p>

  <p>"That was just a high-powered fib. Just a bit of diplomatic
  romance&mdash;for Olivetta's consumption."</p>

  <p>"Then where have you been?" demanded Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Prospecting. Prospecting to find out just how much that
  hundred thousand or two or three you've sunk in me is worth. And
  I've found out. It's present value is not quite nine a week."</p>

  <p>"You mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean," he said pleasantly, "I've been at work."</p>

  <p>"At work!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster slowly rose and looked down at him with
  staring, loose-fallen face.</p>

  <p>"At work!" she gasped again. "At work!"</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>

  <p>"Yes, mother. At work."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but that skidding automobile? Those hands?"</p>

  <p>"Blisters, mother dear. Most horrible blisters."</p>

  <p>"You've worked&mdash;you've worked&mdash;at what?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, mother, if I could have knocked out a home
  run, say a job as a railroad president, when I stepped up to the
  plate in the first inning, I suppose I wouldn't have backed away
  from the chance. But I wanted to find my real value, so I wore
  cheap clothes and kept clear of my friends. 'What could I do?'
  every one asked me. You know my answer. And <i>their</i> answer!
  I thought only sub-way guards could say, 'Step lively,' like
  that. Lordy, how I tramped! But finally I met a kind gentleman
  who gave me a chance."</p>

  <p>"A gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"About the size of your piano&mdash;only he had a red mustache
  and a red shirt and I should say his complexion needed
  re-decorating. Irish&mdash;foreman on a water-main trench."</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;you took it?"</p>

  <p>"Took it? I grabbed it!"</p>

  <p>"J&mdash;a&mdash;c&mdash;k D&mdash;e
  P&mdash;e&mdash;y&mdash;s&mdash;t&mdash;e&mdash;r!" his appalled
  mother slowly exclaimed&mdash;so slowly that each letter seemed
  to shiver out by itself in horrified disjunction. "Well, at any
  rate," she declared with returning vigor, "I'm glad you have had
  enough of it to bring you to your senses and bring you
  home!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id=
  "page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>

  <p>"Oh, I've had enough all right. My cubic contents of ache
  is&mdash;well, you wouldn't believe a man of my size could hold
  so much discomfort. But that isn't the only thing that brought me
  home. It was&mdash;er&mdash;I might say, mother, that it was
  suggested to me."</p>

  <p>"Suggested? I do not understand."</p>

  <p>"If you will permit the use of so inelegant an expression, I
  was 'fired.'"</p>

  <p>"Fired?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The foreman intimated&mdash;I won't repeat his language,
  mother, but the muscles stood out on his profanity in regular
  knots&mdash;he intimated, in a way that left no doubt as to his
  meaning, that I was not quite up to the nine per week standard.
  I'll be honest with you and admit that I didn't lean against the
  pay-shed and weep. I still wanted to work, but I decided that I
  didn't want to start life at its pick-and-shovel end&mdash;if I
  could help it. So here I am, mother, asking you to give me a
  little real education&mdash;say as a mining engineer, or
  something like that."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster was trembling with indignation.</p>

  <p>"J&mdash;a&mdash;c&mdash;k D&mdash;e
  P&mdash;e&mdash;y&mdash;s&mdash;t&mdash;e&mdash;r!" again a
  letter at a time. "J&mdash;a&mdash;c&mdash;k D&mdash;e
  P&mdash;e&mdash;y&mdash;s&mdash;t&mdash;e&mdash;r! I'm astounded
  at you!"</p>

  <p>"I thought you might be&mdash;a little," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"I think you might have some consideration for me! And my
  position!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is rather selfish of me to want to earn
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg
  42]</span> my own living. But you don't know what dreary hard
  work being a gentleman becomes."</p>

  <p>"I won't have it!" cried Mrs. De Peyster wrathfully. "This is
  what comes of your attending that Intercollegiate Socialist thing
  in college! I protested to the president against the college
  harboring such unsettling influences, and urged him to put it
  out."</p>

  <p>"Well, dear old prexy did his best to comply."</p>

  <p>"It's that Socialist thing! As for what you propose, I simply
  will not have it!"</p>

  <p>"No? I could have started in up at Columbia, and kept it from
  you. But I wanted to be all on the level&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I won't have it!"</p>

  <p>"You really mean that you are not going to add a few thousand
  more to my hundred thousands' worth of education?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly shall not!"</p>

  <p>"Then," said Jack regretfully, "I suppose after all I've got
  to start in at the pick-and-shovel end."</p>

  <p>"No, you will not! I have reared you to be a gentleman! And
  you are going to be a gentleman!"</p>

  <p>"Well, if that's the way you feel about it," he sighed, "we'll
  drop the matter&mdash;temporarily."</p>

  <p>"We'll drop it permanently!" said Mrs. De Peyster decisively.
  "Besides, all this talk is utterly footless. You seem to forget
  that you are sailing with me to Europe to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"That brings me to the second point. I was hoping," Jack said
  mildly, "that you would consent to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page43" id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> take my regrets to
  Europe. Don't you think Europe might be willing to overlook my
  negligence&mdash;just this once?"</p>

  <p>"Jack&mdash;I can't endure your facetiousness!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not facetious, mother dear. I'm most confoundedly and
  consummately serious. I really want you to let me off on this
  Europe business. Won't you&mdash;there's a dear?"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"Why, your passage is paid for, and my plans&mdash;You know
  Ethel Quintard and her mother are sailing on the same boat. No,
  most certainly I shall not let you off!"</p>

  <p>"Well, if that's the way you feel about it," he sighed again,
  "perhaps we'd better drop this matter
  also&mdash;temporarily."</p>

  <p>"This matter we'll also drop permanently," his mother said,
  again with her calm, incontrovertible emphasis.</p>

  <p>"Well, that brings us to the third point." He drew a copy of
  the "Record" from his pocket and pointed to a paragraph. "Mother,
  this is the second time my engagement to Ethel Quintard has been
  in print. I must say that I don't think it's nice of Ethel and
  Mrs. Quintard to let those rumors stand. I would deny them
  myself, only it seems rather a raw thing for a fellow to do.
  Mother, you must deny them."</p>

  <p>"Jack, this marriage is bound to come!"</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span>

  <p>"Mother, you are simply hypnotizing yourself into the belief
  that I am going to marry Ethel Quintard. When"&mdash;he painfully
  recrossed his legs, and smiled pleasantly at his
  mother&mdash;"when, as a matter of fact, what I have been trying
  to lead up to is to tell you that I shall never lead Ethel's
  three millions to the altar."</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"It's all off."</p>

  <p>"Off?"</p>

  <p>Jack slowly nodded his head. "Yes, all off."</p>

  <p>"And why, if you please?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for several reasons," he returned mildly. "But one of the
  reasons is, that I happen to be engaged to someone else."</p>

  <p>"Engaged!" gasped Mrs. De Peyster, falling back. "And without
  my knowing it! Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"Mary Morgan."</p>

  <p>"Mary Morgan! I never heard of her. Who's her father?"</p>

  <p>"First name Henry, I believe."</p>

  <p>"I don't mean his name. But who is he&mdash;what's his
  family&mdash;his financial affiliations?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see. Mary told me he runs a shoe store up in
  Buffalo."</p>

  <p>"A shoe store! A shoe store!"</p>

  <p>"Or perhaps," Jack corrected, "it was a grocery. I'm not
  certain."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" gasped Mrs. De Peyster. "Oh! And&mdash;and
  this&mdash;this&mdash;Mary person&mdash;"</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span>

  <p>"She plays the piano, and is going to be a professional."</p>

  <p>For a moment Mrs. De Peyster's horror was inarticulate. Then
  it began to regain its power of speech.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;you throw away&mdash;Ethel Quintard&mdash;for a
  little pianist! You compare a girl like&mdash;like that&mdash;to
  Ethel Quintard!"</p>

  <p>"Compare them? Not for one little minute, mother, dear! For
  Mary has brains and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" exploded Mrs. De Peyster, in majestic rage. "Young
  man, have you considered the social disgrace you are plunging us
  all into? But&mdash;but surely you cannot be in earnest!"</p>

  <p>He looked imperturbably up into her face. "Not in earnest,
  mother? I'm as earnest as a preacher on Sunday."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She choked with her words. Before she could get them out, Jack
  was on his feet and had an arm around her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Come, mother, don't be angry&mdash;please!" he cried with
  warm boyish eagerness. "Before you say another word, let me bring
  Mary to see you. I can get her here before you go on board. The
  sight of her will show you how right I am. She is the dearest,
  sweetest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" She caught his arm. "I shall not see this&mdash;this
  Mary person!"</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>She was the perfect figure of wrath and pride and <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>
  confident power of domination. "I shall never see her! Never! And
  what is more," she continued, with the energy of one who believes
  her will to be equivalent to the accomplished fact, "you are
  going to give up, yes, and entirely forget, all those foolish
  things you have just been speaking of!"</p>

  <p>He gazed squarely back into her flashing eyes. His face had
  tightened, and at that moment there was a remarkable likeness
  between the two faces, usually so dissimilar.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, mother; you are mistaken," he said quietly. "I am
  going to give up nothing."</p>

  <p>"What, you defy me?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"I am not defying you. I tried to tell you in as pleasant a
  way as I could what my plans are. But everything I said, I am
  going to do."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;" At first the words would not come
  forth; she stood trembling, clutching the back of her chair.
  "Then I beg to inform you," she was saying thickly in her
  outraged majesty, when Matilda opened the hall door and ushered
  in an erect, slender man of youngish middle age and with graying
  hair and dark mustache, and with a pleasant, distinguished
  face.</p>

  <p>"I beg pardon; I fear I come inopportunely," he said, as he
  sighted Mrs. De Peyster's militant attitude. "But I was told to
  come right up. I'll just wait&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not go, Judge Harvey," Mrs. De Peyster commanded, as he
  started to withdraw. "On the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span> other hand, your arrival
  is most opportune. Please come here."</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Uncle Bob," Jack said cheerfully. "Excuse me
  for not shaking hands. Just a little automobile accident."</p>

  <p>"Jack, you home!" cried the Judge. "My boy, but you have given
  us all a scare!" And then in affectionate concern, noticing his
  hands: "Nothing serious, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing serious about the accident," said Jack, glancing at
  his mother.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster glared at her son, then crossed to the safe,
  larger and more formidable than the one above from which she had
  been removing her jewels, took out a document and returned to the
  two men. She had something of the ominous air of a tragedy queen
  who is foreshadowing an approaching climax.</p>

  <p>"Judge Harvey, I do not care to go into explanations," said
  she. "But I desire to give you an order and to have you be a
  witness to my act."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I am at your service, Caroline."</p>

  <p>"In the first place," she said, striving to speak calmly, "I
  beg to request my son to move such of his things as he may wish
  out of this house&mdash;and within the hour."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, mother," Jack said pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"And to you, Judge Harvey,&mdash;I wish my son's allowance,
  which is paid through your office, to be discontinued from this
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;of course&mdash;just as you say," said the
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg
  48]</span> astonished Judge. "But perhaps if the case
  were&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This paper is my will," interrupted Mrs. De Peyster, holding
  up the document she had taken from the safe. "As my man of
  affairs, I believe you are acquainted with its contents."</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>"It gives the bulk of my fortune to my son here."</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," admitted the Judge with increasing
  bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"His share amounts to two millions, or thereabouts."</p>

  <p>"Thereabouts."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster took two rustling, majestic steps toward her
  fireplace. "Until my son gives me very definite assurance that
  his conduct will be more suitable to me and my position, he is no
  longer my son." And so saying she tossed the will upon the fire.
  She allowed a moment of effective silence to elapse. "That is
  all, Jack. You are excused."</p>

  <p>Jack stood and watched the flaming will flicker down to a
  glowing ash. One bandaged hand slowly smoothed his blond
  hair.</p>

  <p>"Gee! I've seen people burning up money, and I've burnt up
  quite a bit myself, but I never saw two millions go as quick!
  Well, mother," he sighed, shaking his head, "I never suspected
  I'd end in such a little blaze. With such a pile I could have
  made a bigger bonfire than that."</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <h3>A SLIGHT PREDICAMENT</h3>

  <p>For several moments after Jack had withdrawn, Mrs. De Peyster
  stood in majestic silence beside the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"We will forget this incident, Judge Harvey," she said at
  length. "Be seated, if you please."</p>

  <p>Judge Harvey took a chair, as ordered. Out in the world, Judge
  Harvey was a disconcerting personality, though a respected one; a
  judge who had resigned his judgeship, with the bold announcement
  that law-courts were in the main theaters for farces; a thinker
  who rejected all labels, who was daring enough to perceive and
  applaud what was good even in the conventional.</p>

  <p>"But, Caroline," he began hesitantly, "weren't you perhaps a
  little too stern with Jack?"</p>

  <p>"As I said, Judge Harvey, I do not care to explain the
  situation."</p>

  <p>"I understood it&mdash;a little&mdash;anyhow. See here, you
  don't want Jack to grow up to be a member of that
  geranium-cheeked, leather-chair brigade that stare out of Fifth
  Avenue Club windows, their heaviest labor lifting a
  whiskey-and-soda all the way up to their mouths?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly do not propose to accept the alternative
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg
  50]</span> he proposed!" she retorted. "I assure you, such
  severity as I used was necessary. Nothing will bring a young man
  to his senses so quickly and so surely as having his resources
  cut off." Her composure, her confidence in her judgment, were now
  fully returned. "Jack will come around all right. What I did was
  imperative to save myself; and certainly it was best for
  him."</p>

  <p>"I trust so. But I hope you don't mind if I'm a bit sorry for
  the boy, for, you know,"&mdash;in a lower voice, and with a
  stealthy look at her,&mdash;"Jack's the nearest thing to a son
  I've ever had."</p>

  <p>She did not answer. In the silence that ensued an uneasiness
  crept into his manner.</p>

  <p>"Caroline," bracing himself, "there is
  something&mdash;something you were perhaps not expecting to
  hear&mdash;that I must tell you."</p>

  <p>"I trust, Judge Harvey,"&mdash;somewhat stiffly,&mdash;"that
  you are not about to propose to me again."</p>

  <p>"I am not." His face flushed; then set grimly. "But I'm going
  to again, sometime, and I'd do it now if I thought it would do
  any good."</p>

  <p>"It will not."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know I wouldn't fit into your present scheme of life."
  Bitterness and contempt had risen like a tide in the Judge's
  voice. "I know I'm no social figure; at least, not up to your
  dimensions. I know it would be a come-down to change from Mrs. De
  Peyster to Mrs. Harvey. Not that I'm so infernally humble,
  Caroline, that I don't consider myself <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span> a
  damned lot better than most of the men you might possibly think
  about marrying."</p>

  <p>He rose abruptly, and with a groaning burst of impatience that
  had a tinge of anger: "Oh, for God's sake, Caroline, why don't
  you throw overboard all this fashionable business, this striving
  to keep an empty position, and be&mdash;and be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And be what?" put in Mrs. De Peyster with glittering eye.</p>

  <p>"And be just yourself!" he cried defiantly, squarely facing
  her. "There, at last I've said it! And I'm going to say the rest
  of it. This Mrs. De Peyster that heads everything isn't at all
  the simple, natural gracious Carrie De Peyster that John De
  Peyster and I made love to! You're not the real Mrs. De Peyster;
  you only think you are. This Mrs. De Peyster the world knows is
  something that's been built by and out of the obligation which
  you accepted to maintain the De Peyster dignity. She's only a
  surface, a shell, a mask! If your mother hadn't died, and then
  your mother-in-law, and thrown upon you this whole infernal
  family business and this infernal social leadership, why, you'd
  have been an entirely different person&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Judge Harvey!"</p>

  <p>"You'd then have been the real Mrs. De Peyster!" he rushed
  hotly on. "Oh, all this show, this struggle for place, this
  keeping up a front, I know it's only a part of the universal
  comedy of our pretending to be what we're not,&mdash;every one of
  us is doing the same, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id=
  "page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> in a big way, or a little
  way,&mdash;but it makes me sick! For God's sake, Caroline, chuck
  it&mdash;chuck it all and be just the fine human woman that there
  is in you!"</p>

  <p>She was trembling with suppressed wrath. Never
  before&mdash;not to her face, at least&mdash;had such criticism
  been directed at her.</p>

  <p>"And ultimately be Mrs. Harvey&mdash;no, thank you!" she
  replied, in a choking, caustic voice. "But while you are at it,
  have you any further suggestions for my conduct?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he determinedly. "You have been spending too much
  money, and spending it on utterly worthless purposes. This social
  duel&mdash;that's just what it is&mdash;between you and Mrs.
  Allistair, besides being nonsense, will be absolutely ruinous if
  you keep it up. Mrs. Allistair is as unprincipled in a social way
  as her husband has been in a business way; her ambition will
  hesitate to use no means, you know that&mdash;and, don't forget
  this, she can spend fifty dollars to your one!"</p>

  <p>"I believe," with blazing hauteur, yet still controlled, "that
  I possess something superior to Mrs. Allistair's dollars."</p>

  <p>"Yes," groaned the Judge, "your confounded old-family
  business!"</p>

  <p>"And speaking of money," continued Mrs. De Peyster in her
  cuttingest, most withering, most annihilatory grand manner,
  "perhaps I should have spent my money worthily, like Judge
  Harvey, upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id=
  "page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> a gift of Thomas Jefferson letters to
  the American Historical Society."</p>

  <p>The shaft of sarcasm quivered into the center of Judge
  Harvey's sorest spot. Those recently discovered letters of Thomas
  Jefferson which Judge Harvey had presented to the Historical
  Society, and which had been so widely discussed as throwing new
  light upon the beginnings of the United States Republic, had a
  month before been pronounced and proved to be clever but arrant
  forgeries. The newspaper sensation and the praise that had
  attended the discovery and gift&mdash;warming and exalting Judge
  Harvey's very human pride&mdash;had been followed by an
  anti-climax of gibes and jeers at his gullibility. Whenever the
  hoax was spoken of, Judge Harvey writhed with personal
  humiliation, and with anger against the person who had recalled
  his discomfiture, and with a desire for vengeance against the
  perpetrator of the swindle.</p>

  <p>"Remember this, that the first experts pronounced those
  letters genuine," he retorted in a hot, trembling voice. "And I'm
  going to get that scoundrel&mdash;you see! Only to-day I had word
  from the Police Commissioner that his department at last had
  clues to that fellow Preston. And, besides," he ended cuttingly,
  "though I was deceived, I at least made an effort to spend my
  money upon a worthy object."</p>

  <p>They glared into one another's eyes; old friends now
  thoroughly aroused against each other. They might be sarcastic or
  out-spoken; but their self-respect, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> their
  good-breeding, would not permit them to become vituperative, to
  lose themselves in outbursts of wrath&mdash;though such might
  have been the healthier course. They knew how to plug the
  volcano. So for a space, though they quivered, they were
  silent.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster it was who first spoke. Her voice had
  recovered its most formal, frigid tone.</p>

  <p>"Please recall, Judge Harvey, that you are here at the present
  moment not as a friend but as my man of affairs."</p>

  <p>"All right," he said grimly. "But at least I've told you what
  I thought as a friend."</p>

  <p>"As my man of affairs," she continued with her magnificent
  iciness, "you may now tell me what you have been able to do for
  me about a cottage in Newport."</p>

  <p>"Very well, here goes as your man of affairs: You said you
  wished to be in Newport from the middle of July to early in
  September."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"The house, of those available, which I thought would come
  nearest suiting you is 'The Heron's Nest.'"</p>

  <p>"You mean the cottage Mrs. Van der Grift had last season?"</p>

  <p>"The same."</p>

  <p>"You need not describe it then. I know it perfectly. It is
  exactly what I desire; elegant, but not showy. And the
  terms?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id=
  "page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>

  <p>"Ten thousand for the season."</p>

  <p>"Quite satisfactory. I hope you have taken a lease."</p>

  <p>"I have an option till to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Then close it. I suppose you have brought my letters of
  credit?"</p>

  <p>"That," said he in formal lawyer tone, "brings me back to the
  news which, as your man of affairs, I was trying to break to you
  when you thought, as a friend, I was trying to propose."</p>

  <p>"What news?"</p>

  <p>"You will recall that the money with which I was to buy your
  letters of credit was money which I was to draw for you, to-day,
  as dividends on the stock you hold in the New York and New
  England Railroad."</p>

  <p>"Certainly&mdash;though I do not see the drift of your
  remarks."</p>

  <p>"And I hardly need remind you that the bulk of your fortune is
  invested in this railroad."</p>

  <p>"A perfectly good stock, I believe," Mrs. De Peyster
  commented.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly good&mdash;perfectly sound," Judge Harvey agreed.
  "But there has existed a certain possibility in the company's
  affairs for some time of which I hesitated to inform you. I did
  not wish to give you any unnecessary concern, which would have
  been the case if I had spoken to you and if the situation had
  terminated happily."</p>

  <p>"And what is the situation to which you
  refer?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id=
  "page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>

  <p>"You are doubtless aware that all the railroads have been
  complaining about bad business, owing to increased wages on the
  one side and governmental regulation of rates on the other.
  That's the way the officers explain it; but the truth is, the
  roads have been abominably mismanaged."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have vaguely heard something about bad business," said
  Mrs. De Peyster with a bored air. "But what does all this lead
  to?"</p>

  <p>"I am trying to lead you gently, Mrs. De Peyster, to realize
  the possibility that, in view of its alleged bad business, the
  New York and New England might decide to pass dividends for this
  quarter."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster started forward. "Do you mean to say, Judge
  Harvey, that such a possibility exists?"</p>

  <p>"It's rather more than a possibility."</p>

  <p>"More than a possibility?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. In fact, it's a&mdash;a fact."</p>

  <p>"A fact?"</p>

  <p>"I have just come from the meeting of the directors. They have
  voted to pay no dividends."</p>

  <p>"No dividends!" Mrs. De Peyster gazed stupefied into the face
  of Judge Harvey. "No dividends! Then&mdash;then&mdash;my
  income?"</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," said Judge Harvey.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster sank back in her chair and laid one hand
  across her eyes. For a moment she was dazed by this undreamed-of
  disaster; so overwhelmed that she did not even hear Judge Harvey,
  whose anger had ere this begun to relax, try to reassure
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg
  57]</span> her with remarks about the company being perfectly
  solvent. But it was not befitting the De Peyster dignity to
  exhibit consternation. Instinct, habit, ruled. So, after a
  moment, she removed her hand, and, though all her senses were
  floundering, she remarked with an excellent imitation of
  calm:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, Judge Harvey, for your information."</p>

  <p>Judge Harvey, though still resentful, was by now feeling
  contrite for his share of their quarrel and looked unusually
  handsome in his contrition. And in his concern he could not help
  pointing the way out.</p>

  <p>"I trust you have enough in your bank for your present plans.
  And if not, your bank will readily advance you what you
  need."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said she with her mechanical composure.</p>

  <p>"Or if there is any difficulty," he continued, desirous of
  making peace, "I shall be glad to arrange a loan for you."</p>

  <p>She was too blinded by disaster to think, to realize her
  needs. And dazed though she was by this reverse, her anger
  against Judge Harvey for daring to criticize burned as high as
  before. And then, too, she remembered the haughtiness with which
  she had just refused his advice and put him in his place. At that
  moment, the person of all persons in the world from whom it would
  have been most humiliating to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page58" id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> her to accept even a
  finger's turn of assistance was Judge Harvey.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I shall manage very well."</p>

  <p>"And the Newport house?"</p>

  <p>"I shall send you my instructions concerning it later."</p>

  <p>He hesitated, waiting for her to speak. But she did not.</p>

  <p>"Then that is all?" he queried.</p>

  <p>"Quite all," she replied.</p>

  <p>He still lingered. He was not to see her again for three
  months. And he didn't like to part like this; even if&mdash;</p>

  <p>"After all, Caroline," he said impulsively, holding out his
  hand, "let's forget what we said and be friends. At any rate, I
  certainly hope you have a most enjoyable time in Europe."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I am sure I shall have."</p>

  <p>Her words were cool, calm; the hand she gave him was without
  pressure. Stiffening again, he made her the briefest of bows and
  angrily walked out.</p>

  <p>At the sound of the closing door, announcing that Judge
  Harvey's eyes were outside the room, Mrs. De Peyster unloosed the
  mantle of dignity, which with so great an effort she had kept
  folded about her person, let her face fall forward into her
  hands, and slumped down into her chair, a loose, inert bundle.
  Several lifeless minutes dragged by.</p>

  <p>A little before, during a silence between Judge <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> Harvey
  and Mrs. De Peyster, the study door had slowly opened and there
  had appeared the reconnoitering face of the entrapped Mr.
  Bradford. Though their attention had apparently been too centered
  on each other for them to be observant of what happened beyond
  their very contracted horizon, that had seemed to him no
  promising moment to try for an escape. With high curiosity, eyes
  amused and alight with delectable danger, he had studied Judge
  Harvey a moment, and then the duchess-like Mrs. De Peyster in her
  most magnificent towering attitude of wrathful hauteur. Then
  quickly and soundlessly the heavy door had closed.</p>

  <p>Now again the heavy, sound-proof door of the study began to
  open&mdash;noiselessly, inch by inch. Again the light, humorous,
  but shrewd, very shrewd, face of Mr. Bradford appeared in the
  crack. This time the face did not withdraw. He watched the bowed
  figure of the solitary Mrs. De Peyster for several moments;
  considered; measured the distance to the door of escape;
  evaluated the silencing quality of the deep library rug; then
  slipped through the door, closed it, and with tread as soft as a
  bird's wing against the air started across the room.</p>

  <p>At Mrs. De Peyster's back curiosity checked him and he turned
  his whimsical face down upon the motionless figure. The great
  Mrs. De Peyster! He wondered what had thus changed her from the
  all-commanding presence of a few moments since; for within that
  perfection of a study he had overheard <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
  nothing. An instant he stood thus at her back, alert to disappear
  upon the warning of a changing breath&mdash;the two but an arm's
  reach apart, and apparently about to go their separate ways
  forever&mdash;she unconscious of him, and he equally unconscious
  of the seed of a common drama which their own acts had already
  sown&mdash;with never a thought that ships that pass in the night
  may possibly alter their courses and meet again in the
  morning.</p>

  <p>He slipped on out of the room, closing the door without a
  sound. In the hallway he paused. He wished to see Miss Gardner
  again, ignorant of the sudden fate that had befallen her. But he
  decided little would be gained by trying for another meeting.
  Certainly she must have relented sufficiently to have picked up
  the card he had given her; and perhaps she would change her mind
  and send him a message in care of the Reverend Mr. Pyecroft.
  Anyhow, that was his best hope.</p>

  <p>Lightly, and with a light heart&mdash;for the presence of
  danger was to him a stimulant&mdash;he went down the stairs, eyes
  and ears on guard against unfortunate rencontres, and eyes also
  instinctively noting doors and passages and articles worth a
  gentleman's while. At the front door he waited a moment until the
  sidewalk was empty; then he let himself out, and went down Mrs.
  De Peyster's noble stone steps, his face pleasant and
  frank-gazing, and with the easy self-possession of departing from
  a call to wish a friend <i>bon-voyage</i>.</p><span class=

  <h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <h3>THE HONOR OF THE NAME</h3>

  <p>After a time Mrs. De Peyster rose totteringly from the sheeted
  library chair, mounted weakly to the more intimate asylum of her
  private sitting-room, and sat down and stared into her fire. She
  was still dazed by Judge Harvey's announcement of the decision of
  the New York and New England to pay no dividends.</p>

  <p>She was not rich, as the rich count riches. Nor did she desire
  a greater wealth; at least not much greater. In fact, she looked
  down upon the possessors of those huge fortunes acquired during
  the last generation as upon beings of an inferior order. It was
  blood-discs that gave her her supremacy, not vulgar discs of
  gold. She had enough to maintain the De Peyster station, but just
  enough; and she had so adjusted her scale of living that her
  expenses exactly consumed her normal income&mdash;no more, no
  less.</p>

  <p>That is, had exactly consumed it, except during the last year
  or two. One reason she had so resented Judge Harvey's criticism
  of her manner of living was that the criticism had the
  unfortunate quality of being based on truth. Of late, the
  struggle to maintain her inherited and rightful leadership had
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg
  62]</span> involved her in greatly increased expenditure, and
  this excess she had met in ways best known to herself.</p>

  <p>The collapsed Mrs. De Peyster heard Matilda enter, pause, then
  pass into the bedroom, but did not look up; nor a moment later
  when Olivetta re&amp;#235;ntered from the bedroom, did she at
  first raise her dejected head.</p>

  <p>"Why, what's the matter, Cousin Caroline?" cried Olivetta.</p>

  <p>There was no occasion for maintaining an appearance before
  Olivetta, who was almost as faithful and devoted as though a very
  member of her body. So Mrs. De Peyster related her misfortune,
  interrupted by frequent interjections from her sympathetic
  cousin.</p>

  <p>"Do you realize what it means, Olivetta?" she concluded in a
  benumbed voice. "It means that, except for less than a thousand
  which I have on hand,&mdash;a mere nothing,&mdash;I am penniless
  until more dividends are due&mdash;perhaps months! I cannot go to
  Europe! I cannot go to Newport!"</p>

  <p>Olivetta was first stunned, then was ejaculative with
  consternation.</p>

  <p>"But, Caroline," she cried after a moment, "why not have Judge
  Harvey get you the money?"</p>

  <p>"Out of the question, Olivetta; I do not care to explain." She
  would never unbend to Judge Harvey! Never!</p>

  <p>"Then, why not borrow the money from the bank, as you say
  Judge Harvey suggested?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page63" id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>

  <p>"Olivetta, you should know that that is against my
  principles." She tried to instill proud rebuke into her voice.
  But just here was the pinch&mdash;or one of them. To cover the
  excess in her expenses she had already borrowed&mdash;secretly,
  for she would never have had it come to Judge Harvey's
  knowledge&mdash;from her bank to the very limit of her personal
  credit.</p>

  <p>Olivetta's distressed eyes fell upon one of the jewel cases
  which Marie had left in the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"There are your jewels, Caroline. But, of course you wouldn't
  consider raising money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On my jewels! How can you think of such a thing!"</p>

  <p>"Of course not, of course not," fluttered Olivetta. "Please
  forgive me, Caroline. I do so admire your strict principles!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster accepted apology and tribute with a forgiving
  nod. But just here was another of the pinches. The previous
  spring, while in Paris, she had had her jewels most
  confidentially replaced with excellent imitations; and the
  original stones were at this moment lying as pledges in the
  vaults of a Parisian banker.</p>

  <p>"But, Caroline," pursued the sympathetic Olivetta, "can't you
  cut down expenses and remain in town? What with your credit, you
  have enough for that!"</p>

  <p>"Remain in town, when everybody is leaving?" cried Mrs. De
  Peyster. "Are you out of your senses <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>
  Olivetta? Why, people would never stop talking about it!"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;you're right&mdash;forgive me," stammered
  Olivetta. "But you might go to some modest resort for the
  summer&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;go to Europe in a more modest
  way."</p>

  <p>"Olivetta, you grow more absurd every moment!" exclaimed Mrs.
  De Peyster. "You know it has long been my custom to spend the
  first half of the summer in Europe, in a style befitting me, and
  to spend the second half in Newport. To do less would set people
  talking, and might endanger my position."</p>

  <p>"Of course! Of course!" cried the humbled Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"I hope you fully realize my dilemma."</p>

  <p>"It is terrible&mdash;terrible!" Olivetta's tone was slow, and
  full of awed dismay. "You must maintain your social position and
  there is no money!"</p>

  <p>"Just so."</p>

  <p>Detailed horrors of the situation began to move in spasmodic
  procession through Olivetta's mind.</p>

  <p>"And your passage is taken on the Plutonia&mdash;and it has
  been widely announced that you are leaving for Europe&mdash;and
  that newspaper is going to print your picture among the social
  leaders who have sailed&mdash;and, oh, Caroline, all those
  reporters are going to fill the papers with long articles about
  your going!"</p>

  <p>A new horror, that till then had escaped Mrs. De Peyster's
  inventory, a horror out-climaxing any in <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span>
  Olivetta's tragic list, burst suddenly upon Mrs. De Peyster. Her
  face went pale, fell loose.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Allistair!" she barely articulated.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Allistair?" Olivetta repeated blankly.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see&mdash;if I stay at home&mdash;don't
  sail&mdash;Mrs. Allistair will use it as capital against
  me&mdash;and she'll ride over me to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Caroline!" gasped the appalled Olivetta.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster stood up, rigid with desperation.</p>

  <p>"I simply must sail!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Of course you must! Can't you think of some way out of it? I
  never knew you unequal to an emergency!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster, her brow knitted with agitated thought,
  walked slowly to one of her windows and stood looking down into
  the pleasant bustle of Washington Square. Olivetta watched her
  intently, waiting for the brilliant plan that would be the result
  of her cousin's cogitations.</p>

  <p>But the minutes passed, Mrs. De Peyster did not move, and
  Olivetta's gaze wandered about the large, luxurious sitting-room.
  Her mind roamed afar to the desolate realm which she inhabited,
  and she thought of her own sitting-room, dark and stingily
  furnished, and rather threadbare, in which she was expecting to
  spend the summer, save for a few weeks at a respectable,
  poor-relations' resort. She sighed.</p>

  <p>"If it wasn't for your social position," she said, half to
  herself, "it really wouldn't be so bad to spend the summer
  here."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id=
  "page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster must have heard, for she turned slowly about
  and gazed at Olivetta&mdash;gazed at her steadily. And gradually,
  as she gazed, her whole appearance changed. The consternation on
  her face was succeeded by calm resolution. Poise and dignity
  returned.</p>

  <p>"You have an idea, Caroline?" cried Olivetta, struck by her
  look.</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster stood silent for yet a few more moments. Then,
  completely her dignified and composed self, she stepped toward
  her bedroom. Olivetta's eyes followed her in wondering,
  worshipful fascination.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Matilda!"</p>

  <p>The housekeeper instantly appeared.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mrs. De Peyster."</p>

  <p>"Matilda, call William and have him waiting in the hall till I
  summon him. Come back immediately."</p>

  <p>"But, Cousin Caroline, what is it?" asked Olivetta excitedly,
  as Matilda went out.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" said Mrs. De Peyster in a majestic tone.</p>

  <p>A minute passed, Mrs. De Peyster standing composedly by the
  fireplace, Olivetta gazing at her in throbbing suspense. Then
  Matilda returned. Her Mrs. De Peyster summoned to her side.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, you have proved your loyalty to me by twenty years
  of service," she began, "and you, Olivetta, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span> I know
  are completely devoted to me. So I know you both will faithfully
  execute my requests. But I must ask you not to breathe a word of
  what I tell you, and what we do."</p>

  <p>"I?" cried Olivetta. "Never a syllable!"</p>

  <p>"Nor I, ma'am,&mdash;never!" declared Matilda.</p>

  <p>"But first, Matilda, I must acquaint you with a situation that
  has just arisen." And Mrs. De Peyster outlined such details of
  her predicament as she thought Matilda needed to know. "And now,
  here are my orders, Matilda. The house, of course, is being
  boarded up as usual. All the servants are sent away except
  William; and that order, if you have given it, for a maid for me
  is to be countermanded. You, Matilda, are to remain here alone in
  charge of the house as has been your custom. The report that I am
  sailing is to be allowed to stand. But in reality&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, in reality?" cried the excited Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"In reality," continued Mrs. De Peyster calmly, for she knew
  how a <i>d&amp;#233;nouement</i> is heightened by a quiet
  manner&mdash;"in reality, I shall, during the entire summer, stay
  here in my own house."</p>

  <p>"Stay here!" ejaculated Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"Stay here!" exclaimed Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Stay here. Chiefly in my suite. Secretly, of course. No one
  but you two will ever know of it. By staying here, I shall be
  practically at no expense. But the world will think I am in
  Europe, and my position will be saved."</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>

  <p>Staggered as she was, Olivetta had remaining a few fragments
  of reason.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but, Caroline! You cannot merely announce that you
  are going abroad! You are a person of importance&mdash;your every
  move is observed. People will see that you do not sail. How will
  you get around that?"</p>

  <p>It sounded a poser. But Mrs. De Peyster was unruffled.</p>

  <p>"Very simply, Olivetta. You shall sail in my stead."</p>

  <p>"Me!" cried Olivetta, yet more bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but, if you cannot afford Europe for yourself, how
  can you afford it for me?"</p>

  <p>"It would take a great many thousands for me to go in the
  manner that is expected of me. I cannot afford that. For you,
  Olivetta, since the passage is already paid, it would take but a
  few hundred&mdash;and that I can afford."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you mean that I am to pass for you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But I never can! People will know the difference!"</p>

  <p>"People will never see you," returned the calm voice of Mrs.
  De Peyster. "The Plutonia sails at one to-night. You will go on
  board with my trunks late this evening, heavily veiled. Since no
  one must see you on the way over, you must of course, keep to
  your cabin. You must be seasick."</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>

  <p>"But I am never seasick!" cried Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"Then you must stay in your berth anyhow and pretend to be.
  You are to be too ill to receive any friends who may chance to be
  on board. Your stewardess will bring your meals to your
  stateroom. When the boat arrives, you must wait till every one
  else is off, and when you land you must again be heavily veiled
  and be too sick to speak to any one. Once you are in
  Paris&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there's the difficulty!"</p>

  <p>"Not so great as you think. I shall give you full directions
  what to do. Once you are in Paris, you quietly disappear. It will
  become known that Mrs. De Peyster has gone off on a long motor
  trip through unvisited portions of Europe and will not return for
  the Newport season. With Mrs. De Peyster started on this trip,
  you become yourself, and you see Europe just as you please."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" ejaculated Olivetta, drawing in a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"But please, ma'am," put in Matilda, "why could you not go
  over yourself and then slip away to some modest resort?"</p>

  <p>"So many people know me I should be sure to be seen and
  recognized. And then think of the talk! No, that would never do.
  I have considered all possibilities. My plan is best."</p>

  <p>"Of course, you're right, ma'am," agreed Matilda.</p>

  <p>"On the way back, Olivetta, you are to preserve the same
  precautions as on the way over. And to <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> avoid
  any possible difficulty in getting into the house, I shall
  provide you with a key to the house and one to my
  sitting-room."</p>

  <p>"But you, ma'am," objected Matilda, "in the mean time you
  cannot stay cooped up all summer in this room!"</p>

  <p>"I do not intend to," returned Mrs. De Peyster with her
  consummate calm, which assured her co-conspirators that they
  could lean untroubled upon her unblundering brain. "Matilda, will
  you now please have William come in?"</p>

  <p>Matilda, bewildered but obedient, stepped to the door and a
  moment later followed in the most clean-shaven, the most stiffly
  perpendicular, the most deferentially dignified, the most
  irreproachably expressionless of men-servants. He was the
  ultimate development of his kind. It seems almost a sacrilege to
  add that he was past man's perfect prime, and to hint that
  perhaps his scanty, unstreaked hair sought surreptitious
  rejuvenation in a drug-store bottle.</p>

  <p>"William, Matilda will acquaint you with certain alterations
  in my plans," began his mistress. "I desire to add that she will
  remain in the house alone during my absence; that you are to keep
  to your quarters in the stable and not enter the house; and that
  you are to arrange to take, at my expense, all your meals
  outside."</p>

  <p>William inclined his body slightly, as if to say, "Yes, my
  lady."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id=
  "page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>

  <p>"And in order to give the horses proper exercise, and to
  relieve Matilda's monotony, I desire you to take Matilda out
  driving every evening."</p>

  <p>Again William bowed a "Yes, my lady."</p>

  <p>"You understand this perfectly?"</p>

  <p>William's lips executed one of their rare movements.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, Mrs. De Peyster."</p>

  <p>"Very well."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster dismissed him with a wave of her hand, and
  William made the exit of a minister from his queen.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean&mdash;" began Matilda, almost breathless.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I mean that I shall go out driving nightly in your
  clothes," responded Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" gasped Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Have no fear. I shall, of course, be veiled, and William is
  the best-trained, the most incurious of servants."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster, looking her most majestic, stood waiting for
  the outburst of approval, just tribute to one who has conceived a
  supernally clever and flawless scheme.</p>

  <p>"Well, now, Matilda," she prompted, "what do you think of the
  whole plan?"</p>

  <p>"Since you thought it out, I&mdash;I&mdash;suppose it's all
  right," stammered Matilda.</p>

  <p>"And you, Olivetta, what do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Me!" cried Olivetta, who for the last minute had <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span> with
  difficulty restrained her ecstasy. "Paris!&mdash;the
  Louvre!&mdash;the Luxembourg!&mdash;Versailles!" She flung her
  arms about Mrs. De Peyster's neck amid a shower of hairpins. "Oh,
  Caroline&mdash;Caroline. It's&mdash;it's simply
  glorious!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id=
  "page73"></a>[pg 73]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <h3>BEHIND THE BLINDS</h3>

  <p>It was the next day.</p>

  <p>Olivetta had mailed a few hurried notes to friends about her
  sudden departure for a complete rest in the utter seclusion of an
  unnamed spot in Maine&mdash;Jack De Peyster had moved
  out&mdash;the front door way and the windows had been boarded
  up&mdash;the house wore the proper countenance of respectable
  desertion&mdash;and up in her sitting-room, lighted only by
  little diamond panes in her thick shutters, sat Mrs. De Peyster
  reading a newspaper. From this she gleaned that Mrs. De Peyster
  had sailed that morning on the Plutonia, having gone on board
  late the night before. Also she learned that Mrs. De Peyster
  would not be back as was her custom for the Newport season, but
  was going to make an extended motor trip off the main-traveled
  roads, perhaps penetrating as far as the beautiful but rarely
  visited Balkan States.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster was well satisfied as she rested at ease in
  her favorite chair. It would not be too much to say that she was
  very proud; for hers was certainly a happy plan, a plan few
  intellects could have evolved. And thus far it had worked to
  perfection, and there was no doubt but that it would work so
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg
  74]</span> to the end; for, although Olivetta, to be sure, was
  rather careless, the instructions given her, the arrangements
  made in her behalf, were so admirable and complete that any
  miscarriage could not possibly have Olivetta for its source.</p>

  <p>Also Mrs. De Peyster was at heart honestly contented. She had
  spoken truly when she had told Olivetta that Europe was old to
  her and had become merely a social duty. Of that fatiguing
  obligation to her position she was glad to be relieved. The past
  season, with its struggle with Mrs. Allistair and that Duke de
  Cr&amp;#233;cy affair, had been a trying one, and she was tired.
  By the present arrangement, which she regarded as nothing short
  of an inspiration, her social prestige was secure, her financial
  difficulties were taken care of, and she herself would have the
  desired opportunity for a sorely needed rest. She would have her
  books, she would have the society of Matilda (for Matilda had in
  the long years grown to be more than a mere servant&mdash;she was
  a companion, a confidant)&mdash;her creature comforts would be
  well seen to by Matilda,&mdash;she would have the whole house to
  roam over at her will during the day, and every night she would
  have the pleasant relaxation of a drive behind the peerless
  William.</p>

  <p>It seemed to her, as she looked forward to it, the most
  desirable of vacations.</p>

  <p>Her mind was quite at ease concerning Jack. Severity, as she
  had said, had been necessary. A bit of privation would do him
  good, would bring him <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id=
  "page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> to his senses; she had no slightest
  doubt of that. And when they met again, he would be in a mood to
  fit into the place she had carefully prepared for him. Of course,
  she would let him off in the matter of Ethel Quintard, if he
  really didn't care for Ethel. There were other nice girls of good
  families. She wouldn't be hard on him.</p>

  <p>Also she felt easier in her mind in the matter of the quarrel
  with Judge Harvey. The sting and humiliation of his words she had
  now cast out of her system; she was really superior to such
  criticism. There remained only Judge Harvey's offense. Certainly
  he had been inexcusably outspoken and officious. Her resentment
  had settled down into a calm, implacable, changeless attitude.
  She would be polite to him, since they must continue to meet in
  the future. But she would keep him coldly at a distance. She
  would never unbend. She would never forgive.</p>

  <p>Next to the column recording her departure she had noted a few
  paragraphs giving the progress of the police in their search for
  James Preston, the forger of the Jefferson letters. What a fool
  Judge Harvey had been in that affair!...</p>

  <p>And yet, in a way, she was sorry. She had liked Judge Harvey;
  had liked him very much. In fact, there had been relaxed moods in
  which she had dallied pleasantly with the thought of marrying
  him. She might, indeed, have married him already had it not been
  for the obvious social descent.</p>

  <p>Also, she thought for a moment of Miss Gardner. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span> In this
  matter she had likewise been quite right. However, aside from the
  deception Miss Gardner had practiced, she had seemed a nice girl;
  and Mrs. De Peyster was lenient enough to feel a very honest wish
  that the husband, who had so rapidly disappeared, was a decent
  sort of man. Perhaps later she might favor them with some
  trifling present.</p>

  <p>She had a light luncheon, for it was her custom to eat but
  little at midday, and spent part of the afternoon with a
  comfortable sense of improvement over one of John Fiske's volumes
  of colonial history; popular novels she abhorred as frivolities
  beneath her. And then she took upon her lap a large volume,
  weighing perhaps a dozen pounds, entitled "Historic Families in
  America," in which first place was given to an account of the
  glories of the De Peysters. Though premiership was no better than
  the family's due, she was secretly pleased with her forebears'
  place in the volume&mdash;in a sublimated way it was the
  equivalent of going in first to dinner among distinguished
  guests. She liked frequently to glance leisurely through the
  pages, tasting here and there; and now, as she did whenever she
  read the familiar text, she lingered over certain passages of the
  deferential genealogist&mdash;whom, hardly conscious of the act
  of imagination, she could almost see in tight satin breeches,
  postured on his knees, holding out these tributes to her on a
  golden salver:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"In 1148 Archambaud de Paster" ... "From an early period of
  the fourteenth century the De Peysters <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> were
  among the richest and most influential of the patrician families
  of Ghent" ... "The exact genealogical connection between the De
  Peysters of the fourteenth century and the above-noted sixteenth
  and seventeenth century ancestors of the American De Peysters has
  not been traced, as the work of translating and analyzing the
  records of the intervening period is still incompleted.
  Sufficient has been ascertained, however, to leave no doubt of
  the continual progress of the family in possessions, social
  dignity, and public consequence" ... "The first man in New
  Amsterdam who had a family carriage" ... "The chief people of the
  city and province, and stately visitors from the Old World, were
  often grouped together under this roof"....</p>

  <p>Such august and ample phrases could but nourish and exalt her
  sense of worthiness; could but add to her growing sense of
  satisfaction. She closed the ceremonious volume, and her eyes,
  lifting, rested for a gratifying moment on a framed steel
  engraving from the painting of Abraham De Peyster, Mayor of New
  York from 1691 to 1693. The picture pleased her, with its
  aristocratically hooked nose, its full wig, its smile of amiable
  condescension. But fortunately she had forgotten, or perhaps
  preferred not to learn, that when this ancestor was New York's
  foremost figure, the city had had within its domain somewhat less
  than one one-thousandth of its present subjects.</p>

  <p>And then her eyes wandered to the three-quarters portrait of
  herself by M. Dubois, hung temporarily <span class=

  room. Yes, it was good. M. Dubois had caught the peculiar De
  Peyster quality. One looked at it and instinctively thought of
  generations processioning back into a beginningless past. "In
  1148 Archambaud de Paster" ...</p>

  <p>Toward five o'clock she rose and, a stately figure in lavender
  dressing-gown, strolled through the velvet hush of the great
  darkened house: over foot-flattering rugs, through silken
  hangings that rustled discreet homage at her passing, by dark
  tapestries lit with threads of gold, among shadowy bronzes and
  family portraits and pier-glasses and glinting cut-glass
  candlesticks and chandeliers. So exaltative yet so soothing, this
  opulent silence, this spacious solitude!</p>

  <p>And for an almost perfect hour she sat in her rear
  drawing-room, lightly, ever so cautiously, touching bits of Grieg
  and Tschaikowsky out of her Steinway Grand&mdash;just dim
  whispers of music that did not breathe beyond the door. She
  played well, for she loved the piano and had a real gift for
  instrumentation. Often when she played for her friends, she had
  to hold herself in consciously, had to play below her ability;
  for to have allowed herself to play her best might have been to
  suggest that she was striving to be as good as a professional,
  and that would have caused comment and been in bad taste.</p>

  <p>Her piano was going to be another comfort to her.</p>

  <p>She was complacent&mdash;even happy&mdash;even exultant. It
  was all so restful. And before her were three <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>
  months&mdash;three beautiful months&mdash;of this calm, this
  rest, this security.</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock Matilda announced that her dinner was ready,
  and she swept back into the great dining-room, high-ceilinged,
  surfaced completely with old paneling of Flemish oak. The room
  was dimly illuminated by a single shaded electric bulb. The other
  lighting had all been switched off; during the summer the
  illumination would, of course, have to be unsuspiciously meager.
  To a mortal of a less exalted sphere the repast would have seemed
  a banquet. Mrs. De Peyster, though an ascetic at noon, was
  something of an epicure at night; she liked a comfortable
  quantity, and that of many varieties, and these of the best.
  Under the ministrations of Matilda she pleasurably disposed of
  clear soup, whitebait, a pair of squabs on toast with asparagus
  tips, and an alligator pear salad.</p>

  <p>"Really, Matilda," she remarked with benign approval as she
  leisurely began on her iced strawberries, "I had quite forgotten
  that you were such a wonderful cook. Most excellent!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, ma'am," In her enjoyment Mrs. De Peyster had not
  noticed that throughout the meal her faithful attendant had worn
  a somewhat troubled look.</p>

  <p>"Just give me food up to this standard, and I shall be most
  happy, my dear. My summer may grow somewhat tedious toward the
  end; I shall count a great deal on good meals to keep it
  pleasant."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id=
  "page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;of course&mdash;" and then a salad plate
  slipped from Matilda's hands. "Oh, ma'am, I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, Matilda?" demanded Mrs. De Peyster, a
  trifle stern at this ineptness.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, ma'am. Nothing at all. I'll see that you get it,
  b&mdash;but I don't know how I'll get it."</p>

  <p>"Don't know how?"</p>

  <p>"You see, ma'am, the butcher, the grocer, everybody thinks I'm
  the only person in the house. We've always traded with these same
  people, and I've stayed here alone now for fifteen summers, and
  they know I eat very little and care only for plain food. And so
  to-day when I ordered all these things, they&mdash;they grinned
  at me. And the butcher said, 'Living pretty high, while the
  missus is away.'"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster had dropped her dessert spoon, and was staring
  at her confederate. "I never thought about food!" she exclaimed
  in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Nor did I, ma'am, till the butcher spoke. And, besides,
  William received the goods, and&mdash;and he smiled at me and
  said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It does look suspicious!" interrupted Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"I think it does, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"If you keep on having so much food sent in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And such high quality, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Some one may suspect&mdash;become curious&mdash;and might
  find out&mdash;might find out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's what I was thinking of, ma'am."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster had risen.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page81" id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>

  <p>"Matilda, we cannot run that risk!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps&mdash;perhaps, ma'am, we'd better change our butcher
  and grocer."</p>

  <p>"That would do no good, for the new ones would find out that
  there was supposed to be only a single person here, No, such
  ordering has got to be stopped!"</p>

  <p>"If you can stand it, I think it would be safer, ma'am. But
  what will you eat?"</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Mrs. De Peyster's air grew almost
  tragic.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, do you realize that you and I have got to live for
  the summer, for the entire summer, upon the amount you have been
  accustomed to ordering for yourself!"</p>

  <p>"It looks that way, ma'am."</p>

  <p>The epicure in Mrs. De Peyster spoke out in a voice of even
  deeper poignancy.</p>

  <p>"Two persons&mdash;do you realize that, Matilda!&mdash;two
  adult persons will have to live for three months upon the rations
  of one person!"</p>

  <p>"And what's worse," added Matilda, "as I told you, I don't eat
  much. I've usually had just a little tea and now and then a
  chop."</p>

  <p>"A little tea and a chop!" Mrs. De Peyster looked as though
  she were going to faint. "A little tea and a chop!... For three
  months!... Matilda!"</p>

  <p>It seemed plain, however, that this was the only way out. But
  standing over the remains of the last <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span> genuine
  meal she expected to taste until the summer's end, her brow began
  slowly to clear.</p>

  <p>"Matilda," she said after a moment, in a rebuking tone, "I'm
  surprised you did not see the solution to this!"</p>

  <p>"Is there one, ma'am? What is it?"</p>

  <p>"You are so fixed in the habit of sending your orders to the
  tradespeople that your mind cannot conceive of any other
  procedure. You are to go out in person, at night, if you like, to
  shops where you are not known, pay cash for whatever you want,
  and carry your purchases home with you. It is really extremely
  simple."</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, ma'am," meekly agreed Matilda.</p>

  <p>With the specter of famine thus banished, confidence, good
  humor, and the luxurious expectancy of a reposeful summer
  returned to Mrs. De Peyster. Soon she was being further diverted
  by the mild excitement of being dressed in one of Matilda's sober
  housekeeper gowns, the twin of the dress Matilda now wore, for
  her evening ride with William. They were fortunately of nearly
  the same figure, though, of course, there was a universe of
  difference in how those two figures were carried.</p>

  <p>Matilda, the competent, skilled Matilda, was inexplicably
  incompetent at this function. So clumsy, so nervous was she, that
  Mrs. De Peyster was moved to ask with a little irritation what
  was the matter. Matilda hastily assured her mistress that there
  was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg
  83]</span> nothing&mdash;nothing at all;&mdash;and buttoned a few
  more buttonholes over the wrong buttons. As she followed the
  fully garbed and thickly veiled Mrs. De Peyster, now looking the
  most stately of stately housekeepers, down the stairway, her
  nervousness increased.</p>

  <p>"I wish&mdash;I wish&mdash;" she began at the door. "What
  <i>is</i> the matter with you, Matilda?" demanded Mrs. De Peyster
  severely.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I rather wish you&mdash;you wouldn't go out,
  ma'am."</p>

  <p>"You are afraid I may be recognized?"</p>

  <p>"No, I wasn't thinking of that, ma'am. I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What else is there to be afraid of?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, ma'am, nothing. But I wish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am going, Matilda; we will not discuss it," said Mrs. De
  Peyster, in a peremptory tone intended to silence Matilda. "You
  may first clear away the dishes," she ordered. "But I believe I
  left a squab and some asparagus. You might put them, and any
  other little thing you have, on the dining-room table; I shall
  probably be hungry on my return from my drive. And then put my
  rooms in order. I believe the tea-tray is still in my
  sitting-room; don't forget to bring it down."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, ma'am. But&mdash;but&mdash;" "Matilda"&mdash;very
  severely&mdash;"are you going to do as I bid you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am,"&mdash;very humbly. "But excuse me for presuming
  to advise you, ma'am, but if you want <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> to pass
  for me you must remember to be very humble and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I believe I know how to play my part," Mrs. De Peyster
  interrupted with dignity. Then she softened; it was her instinct
  to be thoughtful of those who served her. "We shall both try to
  get to bed early, my dear. You especially need sleep after last
  night's strain in getting Olivetta away. We shall have a long,
  restful night."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster opened the door, unlocked the door in the
  boarding and locked it behind her, and stepped into her brougham,
  which had been ordered and was waiting at the curb. "Up Fifth
  Avenue and into the Park, William," she said. She settled back
  into the courtly embrace of the cushions; she breathed deep of
  the freedom of the soft May night. The carriage turned northward
  into the Avenue. Rolling along in such soothing ease&mdash;a
  crowd streaming on either side of her&mdash;yet such
  solitude&mdash;so entirely unknown.</p>

  <p>Restful, yes. And spiced with just the right pinch of mild
  adventure.</p>

  <p>It really could not possibly have been better.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <h3>NOT IN THE PLAN</h3>

  <p>As she rolled northward behind the miraculously erect and
  rigid William, the emotion which had been so mildly exciting when
  she had left her door grew in potency like a swiftly fermenting
  liquor. It was both fearful and delightful. She was all
  a-flutter. This was a daring thing that she was doing&mdash;the
  nearest to a real adventure that she had engaged in since her
  girlhood. Suppose, just suppose, that some one should recognize
  her from the sidewalk!</p>

  <p>The thought sent a series of pricking shivers up and down her
  usually tranquil spine.</p>

  <p>Just as that fear thrummed through her, she saw, a few doors
  ahead, a man come out of a residence hotel. He sighted the De
  Peyster carriage, and paused. Mrs. De Peyster's heart stood
  still, for the man was Judge Harvey. If he should try to stop her
  and speak to her&mdash;!</p>

  <p>But Judge Harvey merely bowed, and the carriage rolled on past
  him.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster's heart palpitated wildly for a block. Then
  she began to regain her courage. Judge Harvey had, of course,
  thought her Matilda. A few blocks, and she had completely
  reassured herself. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id=
  "page86"></a>[pg 86]</span> There was no danger of her discovery.
  None. Almost every one she knew was out of town; she herself was
  known to be upon the high seas bound for Europe; Matilda's gown
  and veil were a most unsuspicious disguise; and William, her
  paragon of a William, so rigidly upright on the seat before
  her&mdash;William's statuesque, unapproachable figure diffused
  about her a sense of absolute security. She relaxed, sank back
  into the upholstery of the carriage, and began fully to enjoy the
  rare May night.</p>

  <p>But a surprise was lying in wait for her as she came into a
  comparatively secluded drive of Central Park. In itself the
  surprise was the most trifling of events&mdash;so slight a matter
  as a person twisting his vertebrae some hundred-odd degrees, and
  silently smiling. But that person was William!</p>

  <p>For a moment she gasped with amazed indignation. To think of
  William daring to smile at her! But quickly she recognized that
  William, of course, supposed her to be Matilda, and that the
  smile was no more than the friendly courtesy that would naturally
  pass between two fellow-servants. Her indignation subsided, but
  her wonderment remained. To think that William could smile,
  William in whose thoroughly ironed dignity she had never before
  detected a wrinkle!</p>

  <p>Just as she had re-composed herself, they rolled into another
  unpeopled stretch of the drive. Again William's vertebrae
  performed a semicircle and again William smiled.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>

  <p>"Fine night, Matilda," he remarked in a pleasant voice.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster shrank back into the cushions. She had the
  presence of mind to nod her head, and William faced about. To put
  it temperately, the situation was becoming very trying. Mrs. De
  Peyster now realized that she had been guilty of a lack of
  forethought. It had not occurred to her, in working out this plan
  of hers, that her frigidly proper William could entertain a
  friendliness toward any one. What she should have done was to
  have given William a vacation and secured an entirely strange
  coachman for the summer who would have had no friendly sentiments
  to give play to.</p>

  <p>But her desire was now all to escape from William's amiable
  attentions.</p>

  <p>"Take me home," she said presently, muffling her voice behind
  her hand and veil, and withdrawing from it its accustomed tone of
  authority.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, to her great relief, the carriage turned
  again into Washington Square and drew up before her house. She
  stepped quickly out.</p>

  <p>"Good-night&mdash;thank you," she said in a smothered
  imitation of Matilda's voice, and hurried up her steps.</p>

  <p>She had unlocked the door in the boarding and had stepped into
  the dark entry, when she became aware that William had deserted
  his horses and was stepping in just behind her. As though it were
  a matter of long custom, William slipped an arm <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> about
  her waist and imprinted a kiss upon her veil.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster let out a little gasping cry, and struggled to
  free herself.</p>

  <p>"Don't be scared, Matilda," William reassured her. "Nobody can
  see us in here." And he patted her on the shoulder with
  middle-aged affection.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster, after her first outburst, realized that she
  dared not cry out, or rebuff William. To do so would reveal her
  identity. And horrified as she was, she realized that there must
  have long existed between William and Matilda a carefully
  concealed affair of the heart.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, dear," William again reassured her, with his
  staid ardor. "It's mighty good to be with you like this,
  Matilda!" He heaved a love-laden sigh. "We've had it mighty hard,
  haven't we, with only being able to steal a minute with each
  other now and then&mdash;always afraid of Mrs. De Peyster. It's
  been mighty hard for me. Hasn't it been hard for you?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster remained silent.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't it been hard for you, dear?" William insisted
  tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Ye&mdash;yes," very huskily.</p>

  <p>"Why, what's the matter, Matilda? I know; you're tired, dear;
  your nerves are all worn out with the strain of getting Mrs. De
  Peyster off." Again his voice became tenderly indignant. "Just
  see how <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id=
  "page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> she treated that Miss Gardner; and
  wouldn't she have done the same to us, if she'd found us out? To
  think, dear, that but for her attitude you and me might have been
  married and happy! I know you are devoted to her, and wouldn't
  leave her, and I know she's kind enough in her way, but I tell
  you, Matilda,"&mdash;William's voice, so superbly without
  expression when on duty, was alive with conviction,&mdash;"I tell
  you, Matilda, she's a regular female tyrant!"</p>

  <p>There was a mighty surging within Mrs. De Peyster, a
  premonition of eruption. But she choked it down. William,
  launched upon the placid sea of his elderly affection, did not
  heed that his supposed inamorata was making no replies.</p>

  <p>"She's a regular tyrant!" he repeated. "But now that she's
  away," he added in a tender tone, "and left just us two here,
  Matilda dear, we'll have a lot of nice little times together."
  And urged by his welling love he again embraced her and again
  pressed a loverly kiss upon Matilda's veil.</p>

  <p>This was too much. The crater could be choked no longer. The
  eruption came.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" Mrs. De Peyster cried, struggling; and her right
  hand, striking wildly out, fell full upon William's sacred
  cheek.</p>

  <p>He drew back amazed.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster searched frantically for the keyhole to the
  inner door.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id=
  "page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>

  <p>"Matilda, I'm not the man to take that!" he declared irefully.
  "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Go! Go!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>He drew back wrathfully, but with an awful dignity.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Miss Simpson. But I'm not a man that forgives.
  You'll be sorry for this!"</p>

  <p>As he started stiffly away Mrs. De Peyster found the keyhole.
  She turned her key, opened the door, and closed it quickly behind
  her. Gasping, shivering, she groped in the dusky hall until she
  found a chair. Into this she sank, half fainting, and sat shaking
  with astoundment, with horror, with wrath.</p>

  <p>Wrath swiftly became the ruling emotion. It began to
  fulminate. She would discharge William! She would send him flying
  the very next morning, bag and baggage!</p>

  <p>Then an appalling thought shot through her. She could not
  discharge William!</p>

  <p>She could not discharge William, because she was not there to
  discharge him! She was upon the Atlantic highroad, speeding for
  Europe, and would not be home for many a month! And during all
  those months, whenever she dared appear, she would be subject to
  William's loverly attention!</p>

  <p>She sat rigid with the horror of this new development. But she
  had not yet had time to realize its full possibilities&mdash;for
  hardly a minute had passed since she had entered&mdash;when she
  heard a key slide into the lock of the front door and saw a vague
  figure <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg
  91]</span> enter the unlighted hall. She arose in added terror.
  Had that William come back to&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh, there you are, Matilda," softly called a voice, and the
  vague figure came toward her.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster's terror took suddenly a new turn. For the
  voice was not the voice of her coachman.</p>

  <p>"J-a-c-k!" she breathed wildly.</p>

  <p>Jack threw an arm about Mrs. De Peyster's shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Ho, ho, that's the time I caught you, Matilda," said he, in
  teasing reproof. "U'm, I saw those tender little love passages
  between you and William!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster stood a pillar of ice.</p>

  <p>"Better not let mother find it out," he advised. "If she got
  on to this! But I'll never tell on you, Matilda." He patted her
  shoulder assuringly. "So don't worry."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster's lips opened. If her voice sounded unlike
  Matilda's voice, the difference was unconsciously attributed by
  Jack to agitation due to his discovery.</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;how do you come here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"With an almighty lot of trouble!" grumbled he. "Came around
  the corner an hour ago just in time to see you drive off with
  William. I've got a key to the inside door, but none to the door
  in the boarding; and as I knew there was nobody in the house I
  could rouse up, there was nothing for it but to wait till you
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg
  92]</span> and William came back. So we've been sitting out there
  on a park bench ever since."</p>

  <p>There was one particular word of Jack's explanation that
  drummed against Mrs. De Peyster's ear.</p>

  <p>"We?" she ejaculated. "We?" Then she noticed that another
  shadowy figure had drawn nearer in the dark. "Who&mdash;who's
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Mary," was Jack's prompt and joyous answer.</p>

  <p>"Mary! Not that&mdash;that Mary Morgan?"</p>

  <p>"She used to be. She's Mary de Peyster now."</p>

  <p>"You're not&mdash;not married?"</p>

  <p>"To-day," he cried in exultation. "We slipped out to Stamford;
  everything was done secretly there, and it's to be kept strictly
  on the quiet for a time." He bent down close to Mrs. De Peyster's
  ear. "Don't let Mary know how mother objected to her; I have n't
  told her, and she doesn't guess it. And oh, Matilda," he bubbled
  out enthusiastically, "she's the kind of a little sport that will
  stick by a chap through anything, and she's clever and full of
  fun, and a regular little dear!"</p>

  <p>He turned. "Come here, Mary," he called softly. "This is
  Matilda."</p>

  <p>The next instant a slight figure threw its arms about Mrs. De
  Peyster and kissed her warmly.</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad to meet you at last, Matilda!" exclaimed a low,
  clear voice. "Jack has told me how good you have been to him ever
  since he was a baby. I know we shall be the very, very best of
  friends!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id=
  "page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>

  <p>"And so&mdash;you're&mdash;you're married!" mumbled Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>Jack was too excited by his happiness to have noticed Mrs. De
  Peyster's voice had it been a dozen-fold more unlike Matilda's
  than it was. "Yes!" he cried. "And wouldn't it surprise mother if
  she knew! Mother, sailing so unsuspiciously along on the
  Plutonia!" He gave a chortle of delight. "But oh, I say,
  Matilda," he cried suddenly, "you mustn't write her!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster did not answer.</p>

  <p>"We don't want her to know yet," Jack insisted; "that's one
  reason we've done the whole thing so quietly." Then he added
  jocosely: "If you tell, there's a thing I might tell her about
  you. About&mdash;u'm&mdash;about you and William. Want me to do
  that&mdash;eh? Better promise not to tell."</p>

  <p>"I won't," whispered Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"It's a bargain, then. But there's something else that would
  surprise her, too. I'm going to work."</p>

  <p>"But not at once," put in Mary de Peyster, <i>n&amp;#233;e</i>
  Mary Morgan, in her soft contralto voice, that seemed to
  effervesce with mischief. "Tell Matilda what you're doing to
  do."</p>

  <p>"I've already told you, Matilda, about my little experiment in
  the pick-and-shovel line. I decided that I didn't care for that
  profession. I've saved a few hundred out of my allowance. Monday
  I'm going to enter the School of Mines at Columbia&mdash;am going
  to study straight through the summer&mdash;night <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span> and day
  till the money gives out. By that time I ought to be able to get
  a job that will support us. And then I'll study hard of nights
  till I become a real mining engineer!"</p>

  <p>"But we've got to live close! Oh, but we've got to live
  close!" exclaimed Mary joyously, as though living close were one
  of the chiefest pleasures of life.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we've certainly got to live close!" emphasized Jack.
  "That's why we're here."</p>

  <p>"Why you're here?" repeated Mrs. De Peyster in a low, dazed
  tone.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Jack gave a gleeful, excited laugh. "I had an
  inspiration how to economize. Says I to Mary, 'Mary, since mother
  is away, and this big house is empty except for you, Matilda, why
  pay rent?' So here we are, and here we're going to live all
  summer&mdash;on the '<i>q t</i>,' of course." He slipped an arm
  about Mary and one about Mrs. De Peyster, and again laughed his
  gleeful, excited laugh. "Just you, and Mary, and me&mdash;and,
  oh, say, Matilda, won't it be a lark!"</p><span class=

  <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <h3>THE HONEYMOONERS</h3>

  <p>Again Jack's arm tightened about Mrs. De Peyster in his
  convulsive glee, and again he exclaimed, "Oh, Matilda, won't it
  be a lark!"</p>

  <p>Only the embrace of Jack's good left arm kept Mrs. De Peyster
  from subsiding into a jellied heap upon her parqueted floor. It
  had ever been her pride, and a saying of her admirers, that she
  always rose equal to every emergency. But at the present moment
  she had not a thought, had not a single distinct sensation. She
  was wildly, weakly, terrifyingly dizzy&mdash;that was all; and
  her only self-control, if the paralysis of an organ may be called
  controlling it, was that she held her tongue.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, at first, there was little necessity for her
  speaking. The bride and groom were too joyously loquacious to
  allow her much chance for words, and too bubbling over with their
  love and with the spirit of daring mischief to be observant of
  any strangeness in her demeanor that the darkness did not mask.
  As they chattered on, Mrs. De Peyster began to regain some slight
  steadiness&mdash;enough to consider spasmodically how she was to
  escape undiscovered from the pair, how she was to extricate
  herself <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id=
  "page96"></a>[pg 96]</span> from the predicament of the
  moment&mdash;for beyond that moment's danger she had not the
  power to think. She had decided that she must somehow get away
  from the couple at once; in the darkness slip unobserved into her
  sitting-room; lock the door; remain there noiseless;&mdash;she
  had decided so much, when suddenly her wits were sent spinning by
  a new fear.</p>

  <p>The real Matilda! Mrs. De Peyster's ears, at that moment
  frantically acute, registered dim movements of Matilda
  overhead.</p>

  <p>Suppose the real Matilda should hear their voices; suppose she
  should come walking down into the scene! With two Matildas
  simultaneously upon the stage&mdash;</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster reached out and clutched the banister of the
  stairway with drowning hands.</p>

  <p>The pair talked on to her, answering themselves. They would
  take the rooms above Mrs. De Peyster's suite, they
  said&mdash;they would give her, Matilda, no trouble at
  all&mdash;they would attend to their own housework,
  everything&mdash;and so on, and so on, with Mrs. De Peyster
  hearing nothing, but reaching aurally out for Matilda's exposing
  tread. To forestall this exposure, she started weakly up the
  stairs, only to be halted by the slipping of Jack's arm around
  her shoulder. The couple chattered on about their household
  arrangements, and Mrs. De Peyster the prisoner of Jack's
  affectionate arm, stood gulping, as though her soul were trying
  to swallow itself, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id=
  "page97"></a>[pg 97]</span> ready to sink through her floor at
  the faintest approach of her housekeeper's slippers.</p>

  <p>And then again the arm of the exuberant Jack tightened about
  her. "Oh, say, what a wild old time we're going to have! Won't
  we, Matilda?"</p>

  <p>"Ye&mdash;yes," Mrs. De Peyster felt constrained to
  answer.</p>

  <p>"But it's mighty dangerous!" cried the little figure, with a
  shivery laugh.</p>

  <p>"Dangerous!" chuckled Jack with his mischievous glee. "Well,
  rather! And that's half the fun. If the newspapers were to get on
  to the fact that the son of <i>the</i> Mrs. De Peyster had
  secretly married without his mother's knowledge, and that the
  young scamp and his wife were secretly living in her
  house&mdash;can't you just see the reporters jimmying open every
  window to get at us!"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" breathed Mrs. De Peyster faintly.</p>

  <p>"Really, Jack," protested the girlish voice, "I think it's
  scandalous of us to be doing this!"</p>

  <p>"Come, now, Mary, nobody's going to be any the worse, or any
  the wiser, for it. We're just using something that would
  otherwise be wasted&mdash;and we'll vanish at the first news that
  mother's coming back. But, of course, Matilda, we've certainly
  got to be all-fired careful. I'll leave the house only in the
  early mornings&mdash;by the back way&mdash;through Washington
  Mews&mdash;either when the coast is clear or there's a crowd.
  There are so many artists and chauffeurs and stablemen coming and
  going through <span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id=
  "page98"></a>[pg 98]</span> the Mews that I'm sure I can manage
  it without being noticed. And I'll come back in the same way; and
  our food I'll smuggle in of nights."</p>

  <p>"And I, Matilda, I shall not mind staying in at all," bubbled
  the Mary person. "It will give me a splendid chance to practice.
  You see, I hope to go on a concert tour this fall."</p>

  <p>"By the way, Matilda, about the row Mary'll be making on the
  piano. Couldn't you just casually mention to anybody you see that
  mother had bought one of these sixty-horse-power, steam-hammer
  piano-players and you were the engineer, running it a lot to
  while away the lonesome months?"</p>

  <p>"Do you want to intimate, sir," demanded Mary with mock
  hauteur, "that my playing sounds like a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What I want to intimate, madam, is that I'd like to avoid
  having our happy home raided by the police. Matilda, you could do
  that, couldn't you&mdash;just casually?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;M&mdash;Mr. Jack," mumbled Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"There, everything's settled. We'll go up to our rooms. You
  wouldn't mind helping us a bit, Matilda?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster had one supreme thought. If they went
  upstairs, they might run into the other Matilda. The frantic,
  drowning impulse to put off disaster every possible moment caused
  her to clutch Jack's arm.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>

  <p>"There's&mdash;something to eat&mdash;in the dining-room.
  Perhaps you'd like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Great idea, Matilda! Lead on."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster gave thanks that all the lights but one had
  been switched off. And fortunately the light from that one shaded
  bulb was almost lost in the great dining-room. Subconsciously
  Mrs. De Peyster recalled Matilda's injunction to "be humble," and
  she let her manner slump&mdash;though at that moment she had no
  particular excess of dignity to discard.</p>

  <p>Jack sighted the food Matilda had left upon the table. With a
  swoop he was upon it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, joy! Squabs! Asparagus!" And he seized a squab by the
  legs, with a hand that was still bandaged. "Here you are, my
  dear," tearing off a leg and handing it to Mary, who accepted it
  gingerly. With much gusto Jack took a bite of bird and a huge
  bite of bread. "Great little wedding supper, Matilda! Thanks. But
  I say, Matilda, you haven't yet spoken up about <i>meine liebe
  Frau</i>. Don't you think she'll do?"</p>

  <p>"Now, Jack dear, don't be a fool!"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Jack de Peyster, I'll have you understand your husband
  can't be a fool! Come now, Matilda,&mdash;my bonny bride, look at
  her. Better lift your veil."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster did not lift her veil. But helplessly she gave
  a glance toward this new wife Jack had thus brought home: a
  glance so distracted that it could see nothing but vibrating
  blurs.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id=
  "page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>

  <p>"Well? Well?" prompted Jack. "Won't she do?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," in a husky whisper.</p>

  <p>"And don't you think, when mother sees her, she'll say the
  same?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure&mdash;I'm sure&mdash;" her choking voice could get
  out no more.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I shall be so afraid!" cried Mary, again with that
  shivery little laugh.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to be afraid of, Mary. Mother's really a good
  sort."</p>

  <p>"Jack! To call one's mother a 'good sort'!"</p>

  <p>"Why not? She's bug-house on this social position business,
  but aside from that she's perfectly human."</p>

  <p>"Jack!" in her scandalized tone. "Isn't he awful Matilda?"</p>

  <p>"Ye&mdash;yes, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Don't call me 'ma'am,' Matilda. Since we're to be together
  constantly this summer, call me Mary."</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'a&mdash;Mary."</p>

  <p>"That's right, Matilda," put in Jack. "We're going to run this
  place as a democracy. You're to have all your meals with us."</p>

  <p>"And I'll help you get them!" Mary cried excitedly. "You'll
  find me tagging around after you most of the time. For, think of
  it, you're the only woman I'm going to see in months!"</p>

  <p>"Ye&mdash;yes, Mary."</p>

  <p>"Jack, you run along, there's a dear," commanded <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>
  Mary, "and unpack your things. Matilda and I want to have a
  little chat."</p>

  <p>"Married six hours, and bossed already," grumbled Jack
  happily. "All right. But that bit of a squab I ate was nothing.
  I'm starved. I'll be back in five minutes and then we'll get a
  real supper down in the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"Yes, all three of us," agreed Mary.</p>

  <p>Jack picked up his bag. Frantically Mrs. De Peyster tried to
  think of some way of holding him back from a possible damnatory
  encounter with Matilda upon the stairway. But she could think of
  nothing. Jack went out.</p>

  <p>Mary ordered Mrs. De Peyster into a chair, and sat down facing
  her.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster strained her ears for the surprised voices
  that would announce the disastrous meeting. But there sounded
  from above no startled cries. Jack must have got to his room,
  unnoticed by Matilda. Mrs. De Peyster breathed just a little
  easier. The evil moment was put off.</p>

  <p>"Matilda," began Mary, "I want you to tell me the honest truth
  about something. I think Jack's been trying to deceive me. To
  make me feel better, the dear boy, he's been telling me there'd
  not be the least doubt about his mother being reconciled to our
  marriage. Do you think she ever will be?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please! Will she, or won't she?"</p>

  <p>"You can only&mdash;only hope&mdash;for the
  best."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id=
  "page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>

  <p>"I hope she will, for Jack's sake!" sighed Mary deeply. She
  picked up an evening paper Jack had brought in. "Did you know his
  mother was very ill at the time she sailed? This paper says she
  was so sick that she was unable to see a single one of her
  friends who came to see her off. That was too bad, wasn't it!"
  There was a great deal of genuine feeling in the voice of the
  small person.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster remained silent.</p>

  <p>"Why, you don't seem at all sympathetic, Matilda!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster put a hand to her lips. "I'm&mdash;I'm very
  sorry, ma'am," she mumbled between her fingers, trying to assume
  Matilda's humility.</p>

  <p>"Why, what's the matter with your voice? It seems husky."</p>

  <p>"It's just"&mdash;Mrs. De Peyster swallowed&mdash;a little
  summer cold I caught to-day. It's&mdash;it's nothing, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry!" exclaimed the little person. "But, Matilda, how
  many more times have I got to tell you I don't like your
  'ma'aming' me. Call me Mary."</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;Mary."</p>

  <p>"That's right. And now, as to Jack's mother; the paper says
  society is very much concerned over her condition."</p>

  <p>On the whole, Mrs. De Peyster's concern over her condition was
  rather more acute than society's. But she had begun to recover in
  a degree, and was now, though palpitant within, making a furtive
  study of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id=
  "page103"></a>[pg 103]</span> Mary. Such light as there was fell
  full upon that small person. Mrs. De Peyster saw a dark, piquant
  face, with features not regular, but ever in motion and quick
  with expression&mdash;eyes of a deep, deep brown, with a glimmer
  of red in them, eyes that gave out an ever-changing sparkle of
  sympathy and mischief and intelligence&mdash;and a mass of soft
  dark hair, most unstylishly, most charmingly arranged, that
  caught some of the muffled light and softly glowed with a reddish
  tone. If there was anything vulgar, or commonplace, about Jack's
  wife, the shaded bulb was too kindly disposed to betray it to
  Mrs. De Peyster's scrutiny.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Mary laughed&mdash;softly, musically.</p>

  <p>"If Jack's mother ever dreamed what Jack and I are doing here!
  Oh&mdash;oh! Some day, after she's forgiven us&mdash;if ever she
  does forgive us&mdash;You've said you're sure she'll forgive us,
  Matilda; do you honestly, truly, cross-your-heartly, believe she
  will?"</p>

  <p>"Y-e-s," said Mrs. De Peyster's numb lips.</p>

  <p>"I do hope so, for Jack's sake!" sighed the little person.
  "After she forgives us, I'm going to 'fess up everything. Of
  course she'll be scandalized&mdash;for what we're doing is simply
  awful!&mdash;but all the same I'll tell her. And after she's
  forgiven us, I'll make her forgive you, too, Matilda, for your
  part in harboring us here. We'll see that you do not suffer."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster realized that she should have expressed thanks
  at this point. But silence she considered better than
  valor.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id=
  "page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>

  <p>"This paper prints that picture of her by M. Dubois again.
  Really, Matilda, is she as terribly dignified as that makes her
  look?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster had to speak. "I&mdash;I&mdash;hardly,
  ma'am."</p>

  <p>"There you go with that 'ma'am' again!"</p>

  <p>"Hardly, Mary," mumbled Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Because if she looks anything like that picture, it must
  simply scare you to death to live with her. Did she ever bend her
  back?"</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"Or smile?"</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"Or forget that she was a De Peyster?"</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"The lady of that picture never did!" declared the little
  person with conviction. "She's just dignity and pride&mdash;calm,
  remote, lofty, icebergy pride. She can say her ancestors
  backwards. Why, she's her family tree, petrified!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster did not feel called upon to add to these
  remarks.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how she can possibly like me!" cried the little
  person. "Do you, Matilda?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose&mdash;you can&mdash;only wait&mdash;and see,"
  replied Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"I haven't got any dignity, or any money, or any ancestors;
  only a father and a couple of grandfathers&mdash;though I dare
  say there were some Morgans before them. No, she'll never care
  for me&mdash;never!" wailed <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span> the little person.
  "She couldn't! Why, she's carved out of a solid block of dignity!
  She never did an un-De-Peyster thing in her life!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster felt herself choking. She had to get out of
  the room, or die.</p>

  <p>Just then Jack walked back in. For a few moments she had
  forgotten Jack. The terror arising from the menace upstairs
  returned to her. But Jack's happy face was assurance that as yet
  he knew nothing of the second Matilda.</p>

  <p>Yes, she had to get out, or die. And Jack's reappearance gave
  her frantic mind a cue for an unbetraying exit.</p>

  <p>"I'll go to the kitchen&mdash;and start supper," she gulped,
  and hurried into the butler's pantry.</p>

  <p>"Jack," she heard Mary's perplexed voice, "Matilda, somehow,
  seems rather queer to me."</p>

  <p>"She doesn't seem quite herself," agreed Jack.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster sank into a chair beside the door, and sat
  there motionless, hardly daring to breathe&mdash;shattered by the
  narrowness of her escape, and appalled by this new situation that
  had risen around her&mdash;too appalled even to consider what
  might be the situation's natural developments. Soon amid the wild
  churning of various emotions, anger began to rise, and outraged
  pride. Such cool, dumbfounding impudence!</p>

  <p>Then curiosity began to stir. Instinct warned her,
  incoherently, for all her faculties were too demoralized to be
  articulate, that this was no place for her. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> But
  those two persons in there&mdash;her son, and this
  daughter-in-law who had burst out of a fair cloud upon
  her&mdash;a daughter-in-law whom she would never
  recognize&mdash;what were they doing? Cautiously, ever so
  cautiously, she pushed open the pantry door till there was a
  slight crack giving into the other room.</p>

  <p>Jack had his arms about Mary's shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well, little lady," she heard him ask with tremulous
  fondness&mdash;the young fool!&mdash;"What do you think of our
  honeymoon?"</p>

  <p>"I think, sir, that it's something scandalous!" (Not such an
  unpleasant voice&mdash;but then!)</p>

  <p>"U'm! Has the fact occurred to you"&mdash;very
  solemnly&mdash;"that you haven't kissed me since we have been in
  this room?"</p>

  <p>"Was it written in the bond that I had to kiss you in every
  room?"</p>

  <p>"No matter about the bond. A kiss or a divorce. Take your
  choice."</p>

  <p>"It isn't worth divorcing you, since you may be too poor to
  pay alimony. So"&mdash;sighing and turning her face up to
  him.</p>

  <p>(Sentimental idiots!)</p>

  <p>"Mary"&mdash;after a moment of clinging lips&mdash;"you think
  you can really be happy with me?"</p>

  <p>"I know I shall be, dear!"</p>

  <p>"Even if things don't go right between mother and me, and even
  if for a long time I shall be awfully, awfully poor?"</p>

  <p>"It's just you I care for, Jack,&mdash;just
  you!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id=
  "page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>

  <p>Jack stared at her; then suddenly:</p>

  <p>"Do you know what I feel like?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Like kissing you again."</p>

  <p>"Now don't be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mary!"</p>

  <p>His voice was tremulous. Slowly their lips came together; they
  embraced; then drew apart, and holding hands, stood gazing at
  each other.</p>

  <p>"You're a dear, dear fool!" said Mary softly.</p>

  <p>"And you're a dear, dear another!" softly said Jack.</p>

  <p>(Outrageous fools, both! agreed Mrs. De Peyster.)</p>

  <p>They were still gazing at each other when in the wide doorway
  at their back appeared Matilda, carrying the tray of tea-things
  that had been in Mrs. De Peyster's sitting-room. For the last few
  moments Mrs. De Peyster's danger had been forgotten in her
  indignation. But at sight of Matilda, regained its own.</p>

  <p>Matilda stopped short. The tea-things almost rattled from the
  tray. Jack wheeled about.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Matilda. Thought you'd gone down to the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;if it isn't Mr. Jack!" stammered
  Matilda.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster trembled. What more likely than that Matilda,
  in her amazement, should reveal the house's secret? But the
  half-light of the room was a <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span> very obliging ally
  against such unsuspicion as her son's.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it's Jack," said he. "Who else did you suppose it
  was? But say, what's the matter, Matilda?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, what's the matter, Matilda?" asked Mary with great
  concern.</p>

  <p>"Ma'am&mdash;ma'am"&mdash;staring wildly at
  Mary&mdash;"I&mdash;I don't know, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"What, have you already forgotten what I told you about
  calling me Mary!"</p>

  <p>"Ma&mdash;Mary?" gasped Matilda blankly.</p>

  <p>"Jack," said Mary in a low voice, "I said awhile ago that she
  seemed queer."</p>

  <p>"Where have you put your head, Matilda?
  Yes&mdash;Mary!&mdash;Mary!&mdash;Mary! Mary De
  Peyster&mdash;Mrs. Jack De Peyster&mdash;my wedded
  wife&mdash;whom it cost me four thirty-nine to make my own.
  Understand?"</p>

  <p>"P-per-perfectly, Mr. Jack."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's happy news. What's that you're carrying?"</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;my breakfast," explained
  Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Your breakfast!" exclaimed Jack. "What are you doing with it
  here?"</p>

  <p>"I was&mdash;I was&mdash;er&mdash;was going to&mdash;to get it
  all ready to&mdash;to take up to myself to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Jack took the tray from Matilda's nerveless
  hands.</p><span class="pagenum"></span>

  <p>"Sit down, Matilda," firmly pressing her into a chair. "Mary,
  have you some salts in that bag."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Jack." In an instant Mary had a bottle from her bag and
  was holding it beneath Matilda's nose. "You'll be all right in
  just a moment. Take it easy. The surprise must have been too much
  for you. For it was a big surprise, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am," replied Matilda, for the first time speaking
  with no hesitancy.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, it's almost provoking the way you ignore my request
  to call me Mary."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;er&mdash;" staring wildly&mdash;"yes, Mary."</p>

  <p>Jack moved to the wall near the door, where were several
  buttons.</p>

  <p>"Mary, I'm going to ring for William&mdash;we'd better take
  him into this thing straight off, or he may stumble on the fact
  that extra people are in the house and call in the police."</p>

  <p>At her crack in the pantry door, Mrs. De Peyster grew even
  more apprehensive.</p>

  <p>Jack and Mary cooed; Matilda sat all of a heap; and presently
  William walked in. To her other emotions, Mrs. De Peyster had
  added a new shock. For William the peerless&mdash;fit coachman
  for an emperor&mdash;William, whom till that night she could not
  have imagined, had she imagined about such things at all, other
  than as sleeping in a high collar and with all his brass buttons
  snugly buttoned&mdash;William was coatless, and collarless, and
  slouching from his mouth was an old pipe!</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>

  <p>He came in with a haughty glower, for he had supposed the ring
  to be Matilda's. But at sight of Jack and Mary his face went
  blank with amazement.</p>

  <p>"Why, why, Mr. Jack!" Hastily he jerked his pipe into his
  pocket and began buttoning the open collar of his shirt.
  "I&mdash;I beg pardon, sir."</p>

  <p>"Hello, William! This is Mrs. Jack, William. Just married.
  We've come to spend the summer with you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"But on the quiet, William. Understand? If you leak a word
  about our being here&mdash;well, I know about the heart-throb
  business between you and Matilda. If you drop one word&mdash;one
  single word, I put mother next to what's doing between you
  two."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Just wanted you to know we were here, William, so you
  wouldn't by any chance throw a surprise that would give us away.
  That's all. Keep mum about us"&mdash;with a sly wink at him and
  another at Matilda&mdash;"and you two can goo-goo at each other
  like a popular song. Good-night."</p>

  <p>Jack turned his back; and Mary, whose heart went out to all
  lovers, delicately turned hers.</p>

  <p>"William," fluttered Matilda, taking an eager, hesitating step
  toward him.</p>

  <p>He stared at her haughtily&mdash;as haughtily as is in the
  power of a mere mortal who has no collar on.</p>

  <p>"William," she cried bewildered, "what is it?"</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>

  <p>"I believe you know what it is, Miss Simpson," he replied
  witheringly, and stalked out under full majesty.</p>

  <p>She stood dumbfounded; but only for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Matilda," spoke up Jack, "have you got supper things started
  yet in the kitchen?"</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;er&mdash;what?" stammered poor Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Say, see here&mdash;what the dickens <i>is</i> the matter
  with you?" Jack exploded in exasperation. "You just promised to
  start supper in the kitchen, and now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;of course," gulped Matilda, "I forgot. I'll
  do it right away."</p>

  <p>Matilda was reeling. But she perceived that here was her
  chance to get out of the room&mdash;and for the moment that was
  her supreme and only desire. She started for the door of the
  butler's pantry.</p>

  <p>"We'll be down with you in about five minutes," Jack called
  after her.</p>

  <p>In the darkness of the pantry a hand fell upon her arm.
  "Matilda," breathed her mistress's voice, and Matilda had enough
  control not to cry out, or was too far gone. Clutching hands,
  they went down the winding stairs that led from the butler's
  pantry to the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"Oh, ma'am, ma'am!" moaned Matilda in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Matilda"&mdash;in awed breathlessness&mdash;"isn't this
  terrible?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ma'am! ma'am!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
  id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>

  <p>"If Jack should learn that I am here&mdash;" She could not
  express the horror of it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, ma'am!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster's voice rang out with wild desperation.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, there is only one thing to do! We must leave the
  house!"</p>

  <p>"I think we'd better, ma'am," Matilda snuffled hysterically,
  "for with all of you here, and this keeping up, I&mdash;I don't
  think I'd last a day, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"And we must leave at once! We've not a second to spare. They
  said they were coming right down. We must be out of the house
  before they come!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ma'am, yes! This minute! But where&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's no time to think of anything now but getting out,"
  cried Mrs. De Peyster with frantic energy. "Slip up the front
  stairway, Matilda, and get your hat. And here are my keys. Lock
  my sitting-room, so they can't see any one's been living in it.
  You can manage it without them seeing you. And for heaven's sake,
  hurry!"</p>

  <p>Two minutes later these things were done, and Matilda,
  bonneted, was hurrying forward hand in hand with Mrs. De Peyster
  through the black hallway of the basement. Behind them,
  descending the stairs from the butler's pantry, sounded the
  chatter and laughter of the larking honeymooners; and then from
  the kitchen came the surprised and exasperated <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>
  call: "Hello, Matilda&mdash;See here, where the dickens are
  you?"</p>

  <p>But at just that moment the twin, unbreathing figures in black
  slipped through the servants' door and noiselessly closed it
  behind them.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id=
  "page114"></a>[pg 114]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <h3>THE FLIGHT</h3>

  <p>The two dark figures stood an instant, breathless, in the dark
  mouth of the cavern beneath the marble balustraded stairway that
  ascended with chaste dignity to Mrs. De Peyster's noble front
  door. Swiftly they surveyed the scene. Not a policeman was in
  sight: no one save, across the way on Washington Square benches,
  a few plebeian lovers enjoying the soft calm of a May eleven
  o'clock.</p>

  <p>The pair, with veils down, each looking a plagiarism of the
  other, slipped out of the servants' entrance, through the gate of
  the low iron fence, and arm clutching arm hastened eastward to
  University Place. Thus far no one had challenged them. Here they
  turned and went rapidly northward: past the Lafayette, where Mrs.
  De Peyster's impulse to take a taxicab was instantly
  countermanded by the fear that so near her home there was danger
  of recognition: and onward, onward they went, swiftly,
  wordlessly, their one commanding impulse to get away&mdash;to get
  away.</p>

  <p>At Fourteenth Street they passed a policeman. Again they
  choked back their breath; shiveringly they felt his eyes upon
  them. And, indeed, his eyes were&mdash;interestedly; for to that
  Hibernian, with his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id=
  "page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> native whimsicality, they suggested
  the somewhat unusual phenomenon of the same person out walking
  with herself. But he did not speak.</p>

  <p>At the head of Union Square they caught a roving taxicab.
  Their next thought, after bare escape, was necessarily concerned
  with shelter, a hiding-place. To the chauffeur's "Where to,
  ladies?" Mrs. De Peyster said, "Hotel Dauphin." The instinct, the
  Mrs. De Peyster of habit, which was beneath her surface of
  agitation, said the Dauphin because the Dauphin was quite the
  most select hotel in New York. In fact, six months before, when
  Mrs. De Peyster desired to introduce and honor the Duke de
  Cr&amp;#233;cy in a larger way than her residence permitted, it
  was at the Dauphin that she had elected to give the ball that had
  brought her so much deferential praise&mdash;which occasion was
  the first and only time she had departed from her strict
  old-family practice of limiting her social functions to such as
  could be accommodated within her own house. She had then been
  distinctly pleased; one could hardly have expected good breeding
  upon so large a scale. And her present subconscious impression of
  the Dauphin was that it was ducal, if not regal, in its reserved
  splendor, in its manner of subdued, punctilious ceremony.</p>

  <p>She could remain at the Dauphin, in seclusion, until she had
  time to think. Then she could act.</p>

  <p>As she sped smoothly up Fifth Avenue&mdash;her second ride on
  the Avenue that night&mdash;she began, in the cushioned privacy
  of the taxi, to recover somewhat <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page116" id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span> from the panic of dire
  necessity that had driven them forth. Other matters began to
  flash spasmodically across the screen of her mind. One of these
  was William. And there the film stopped. The cold, withering look
  William had given Matilda a few minutes before remained fixed
  upon the screen. That look threatened her most unpleasantly as to
  the future. What if William should learn who was the real Matilda
  to whom he had made love!</p>

  <p>"Matilda," she began, calling up her dignity, "I desire to
  instruct you upon a certain matter."</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am," whispered Matilda.</p>

  <p>"I expressly instruct you not to mention or hint to any one,
  particularly William, that it was I and not you who went out
  driving with him to-night."</p>

  <p>"I'll not, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"You swear?"</p>

  <p>"I swear, ma'am. Never!"</p>

  <p>"Remember, Matilda. You have sworn." And relieved of that
  menace, she leaned back.</p>

  <p>The taxi drew up before the Dauphin. A grenadier-lackey, who
  seemed bulk and brass buttons and braid of gold, handed them out
  with august white gloves.</p>

  <p>"Pay the fare, Matilda," ordered Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster's bills, when she had a servant with her, were
  always paid by the attendant. Matilda did so, out of a square
  black leather bag that was never out of Matilda's fingers when
  Matilda was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id=
  "page117"></a>[pg 117]</span> out of the house; it seemed almost
  a flattened extension of Matilda's hand.</p>

  <p>They entered the Dauphin, passing other white-gloved lackeys,
  each a separate perfection of punctiliousness; and passed through
  a marble hallway, muted with rugs of the Orient, and came into a
  vast high chamber, large as a theater&mdash;marble walls and
  ceiling, tapestries, moulded plaster and gilt in moderation,
  silken ropes instead of handrails on the stairways, electric
  lights so shaded that each looked a huge but softly unobtrusive
  pearl. The chamber was pervaded by, was dedicated to, splendid
  repose.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster, Matilda trailing, headed for a booth of
  marble and railing of dull gold&mdash;the latter, possibly, only
  bronze, or gilded iron&mdash;within which stood a gentleman in
  evening dress, with the bearing of one no lower than the first
  secretary of an embassy.</p>

  <p>"A suite," Mrs. De Peyster remarked briefly across the
  counter, "with sitting-room, two bed-rooms and bath."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said the distinguished gentleman. "I have a most
  desirable suite on the fifteenth floor, with a splendid outlook
  over the park."</p>

  <p>"That will do."</p>

  <p>"The name, please?" queried the gentleman, reaching for a
  pen.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. David Harrison," invented Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"When do your employers wish to occupy the <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span>
  suite?" pursued the courtly voice of the secretary of the
  embassy.</p>

  <p>"Our employers!" repeated Mrs. De Peyster. And then with
  wrathful hauteur: "The apartment is for ourselves. We desire to
  occupy it at once."</p>

  <p>The gentleman glanced her up and down; then up and down his
  eyes went over Matilda, just behind her. There was no doubting
  what Matilda was; and since the two were patently the same, there
  could be no doubt as to what Mrs. De Peyster was.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry&mdash;but, after all, the suite is not available,"
  he said courteously.</p>

  <p>"Not available?" cried Mrs. De Peyster. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I prefer to say no more."</p>

  <p>"But I insist!"</p>

  <p>"Since you insist&mdash;the Dauphin does not receive servants,
  even of the higher order, as regular guests." The hotel clerk's
  voice was silken with courtesy; there was no telling with what
  important families these two were connected; and it would not do
  to give offense. "We receive servants only when they accompany
  their employers, and then assign them to the servants' quarters.
  You yourself must perceive the necessity of this," he added
  hastily, seeing that Mrs. De Peyster was shaking, "to preserve
  the Dauphin's social tone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The servants' quarters!" gasped Mrs. De Peyster. "You
  mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll excuse me, please," interrupted the clerk,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg
  119]</span> and with a bow ended the scene and moved to the rear
  of the office where he plainly busied himself over nothing at
  all.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster, quivering, gulping, glared through her veil
  at him. A hotel clerk had turned his back on her! And this mere
  clerk had dared refuse her a room! <i>Refuse her!</i> Because
  she, <i>she</i>, Mrs. De Peyster had not the social tone!</p>

  <p>Nothing like it had ever happened to her before.</p>

  <p>Her desire to annihilate that clerk with the suave
  ambassadorial look, and the Dauphin, and all therein and all
  appertaining thereunto, was mounting toward explosion, when
  Matilda clutched her arm.</p>

  <p>"It's awful, ma'am,&mdash;but let's go," she whispered. "What
  else can we do?"</p>

  <p>Yes, what else could they do? Mrs. De Peyster's wrath was
  still at demolitory pressure, but she saw the sense in that
  question. The next moment the two figures, duplicates of
  somberness, one magnificently upright, the other shrinking, were
  re-passing over the muting rugs, through the corridor of noble
  marble, by the lackeys between whose common palms and the hands
  of patrician guests was the antiseptic intermediary of white
  thread gloves.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it's just as well, ma'am," Matilda began tremulously
  as soon as they were in the street, before Mrs. De Peyster's
  black storm could burst. "How much would that suite have
  been?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps fifty dollars a day."</p>

  <p>"I only just now thought about it&mdash;but&mdash;but
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg
  120]</span> please, ma'am, did you happen to bring your
  purse?"</p>

  <p>"My purse!" Mrs. De Peyster stopped short. "Matilda!"&mdash;in
  a voice chilled with dismay&mdash;"I never thought of my purse
  until this moment! There wasn't time! I haven't a cent!"</p>

  <p>"And after paying for the cab, ma'am, I have only a little
  over fifteen dollars."</p>

  <p>"Matilda!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, ma'am," repeated Matilda, "it was just as well they
  wouldn't take us."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster did not speak.</p>

  <p>"And what's worse," Matilda faltered, as though the blame was
  hers, "the hotels won't trust you unless you have baggage. And we
  have no baggage, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Matilda!" There was now real tragedy in Mrs. De Peyster's
  voice. "What <i>are</i> we going to do?"</p>

  <p>They walked along the Park, whispering over their unforeseen
  and unforeseeable predicament. It had many aspects, their
  situation; it was quickly clear to them that the most urgent
  aspect was the need of immediate refuge. Other troubles and
  developments could be handled as they arose, should any such
  arise. But a place to hide, to sleep, had to be secured within
  the hour. Also they needed two or three days in which to think
  matters over calmly, and to apply to them clear reason. And they
  had only the fifteen dollars in Matilda's black bag.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me, ma'am," ventured Matilda, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>
  "that a rooming-house or a boarding-house would be cheapest."</p>

  <p>"A boarding-house!" exclaimed Mrs. De Peyster. "But
  where?"</p>

  <p>Matilda remembered and reached into her slit pocket.
  "Yesterday I happened to pick up the card of a boarding-house in
  the library&mdash;I've no idea how it came there. I saved it
  because my sister Angelica, who lives in Syracuse, wrote me to
  look up a place where she might stay."</p>

  <p>They examined the address upon the card, and twenty minutes
  later, now close upon midnight, Matilda was pressing the bell of
  a house on the West Side. Visible leadership Mrs. De Peyster had
  resigned to Matilda, for they were entering a remote and lowly
  world whose ways Mrs. De Peyster knew not. In all her life she
  had never been inside a boarding-house.</p>

  <p>The door opened slightly. A voice, female, interrogated
  Matilda. Then they were admitted into a small hall, lighted by an
  electric bulb in a lantern of stamped sheet-iron with
  vari-colored panes and portholes. From this hall a stairway
  ascended, and from it was a view into a small rear parlor, where
  sat a clergyman. The lady who had admitted them was the mistress;
  a Junoesque, superior, languid sort of personage, in a loose
  dressing-gown of pink silk with long train. To her Matilda made
  known their desire.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Pyecroft," she called to the clergyman. "So
  you and your friend want board <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page122" id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span> and room," the
  landlady repeated in a drawling tone, yet studying them sharply
  with heavy-penciled eyes. "I run a select house, so I've got to
  be careful about whom I admit. Consequently you will not object
  to answering a few questions. You and your friend are
  working-women?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>The heavy eyes had concluded their inventory. "Perhaps both
  housekeepers?"</p>

  <p>"Ye&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>Matilda had a double impulse to explain, first to clear Mrs.
  De Peyster of this unmerited indignity, and second to prevent
  their being once more turned away as servants. But something kept
  her still. And perhaps it was just as well. Mrs. Gilbert,
  considering the two, did have a moment's thought about refusing
  them; she, too, liked to maintain the social tone of her
  establishment, and certainly servants as guests did not help; but
  then the arid season for boarding-houses was at hand, and she was
  not one to sacrifice real money to mere principle.</p>

  <p>"How long do you want to stay?"</p>

  <p>"We don't know yet. Per&mdash;perhaps several months."</p>

  <p>This was agreeable news to Mrs. Gilbert. But it was not
  boarding-house policy to show it.</p>

  <p>"When would you want to come in?"</p>

  <p>"Now."</p>

  <p>"To-night!" The penciled eyebrows lifted in surprise. "And
  your baggage?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id=
  "page123"></a>[pg 123]</span>

  <p>"We came to New York without any," Matilda lied desperately.
  "We're&mdash;we're going to buy some things here."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, then, you expect to pay in advance."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;er&mdash;at least a deposit."</p>

  <p>"One room or two?"</p>

  <p>"One." One would come cheaper.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Pyecroft," she called again to the clergyman.
  "This way." And she collected her silken skirt, and swished up
  two flights of stairs and into a bedroom at the back, where she
  turned on the light. "A very comfortable room," she went on in
  the voice of a tired and very superior auctioneer. "Just vacated
  by a Wall Street broker and his wife; very well-connected people.
  Bed and couch; easy-chairs; running hot and cold water. And for
  it I'm making a special summer rate, with board, of only
  twenty-five dollars a week for two."</p>

  <p>"We'll take it," said Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Now the deposit&mdash;how much can you pay?"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;er&mdash;say fifteen dollars?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gilbert's hands that tried to seem indifferent to money
  and that yet were remarkably prompt, took the bills Matilda held
  out and thrust them into the folds of her voluminous gown.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Breakfast Sunday mornings from eight to ten.
  Good-night." And with that her large pink-tinted ladyship made a
  rustling exit.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster sank overcome into a chair, drew <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span> up
  her veil, and gazed about her. The other of Mrs. Gilbert's
  "easy"-chairs had a seat of faded and frayed cotton tapestry;
  there was a lumpy and unstable-looking couch; a yellow washstand
  with dandruffy varnish and cracked mirror; wall-paper with vast,
  uncataloguable flowers gangrenous in suggestion; on the ceiling a
  circle of over-plump dancing Cupids; and over against one wall a
  huge, broad, dark box that to Mrs. De Peyster's amazed vision
  suggested an upended coffin, contrived for the comfort of some
  deceased with remarkable width of shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Matilda!" she shiveringingly ejaculated. "I didn't know there
  was anything like it in the world!"</p>

  <p>"I know, ma'am, that it's not fit for you," grieved Matilda.
  "But&mdash;it's better than nothing."</p>

  <p>"And that thing there!" pointing a shaking finger at the
  abnormal coffin. "What's that?"</p>

  <p>"That's your bed, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"My bed!"</p>

  <p>"It lets down, ma'am. Like this."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Matilda proceeded to let down that <i>sine qua
  non</i> of a profitable boarding-house, while Mrs. De Peyster,
  dismayed, looked for the first time in her life upon the miracle
  of the unfolding of a folding-bed. Her mistress's slumber
  prepared for Matilda then softened the inaccuracies of the
  couch's surface for her own more humble repose.</p>

  <p>Neither felt like talking; there was too much to talk about.
  So soon both were in their beds, the lights out. Mrs. De Peyster
  lay dazed upon this <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id=
  "page125"></a>[pg 125]</span> strange bed that operated like a
  lorgnette: tremulously existing, awake, yet hardly capable of
  coherent thought.</p>

  <p>For a space she heard Matilda toss about, draw long, tremulous
  breaths; then from the couch of that elderly virgin sounded the
  incontrovertible tocsin of deep sleep. But for Mrs. De Peyster
  there was no sleep; not yet.</p>

  <p>She now was thinking; casting up accounts. Exactly twenty-four
  hours since, she had officially sailed. Jack and that Mary person
  were now in sweet and undisturbed possession of her house;
  Olivetta, on board the Plutonia, was this minute reposing at ease
  amid the luxuries of her <i>cabin de luxe</i>; and she, herself,
  Mrs. De Peyster, was lying on a folding-bed, a most knobby
  bed,&mdash;the man who invented cobblestone paving must have got
  his idea from such a bed as this,&mdash;in a boarding-house the
  like of which till this night she had never imagined to
  exist.</p>

  <p>And only twenty-four hours!...</p>

  <p>She stared up toward where, in the dark, the corpulent Cupids
  were dancing their aerial May-ring ... and stared ... and
  stared....</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id=
  "page126"></a>[pg 126]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <h3>PEACE&mdash;OF A SORT</h3>

  <p>The next morning there was a long, whispered discussion as to
  whether Mrs. De Peyster should go down to breakfast or have all
  her meals sent up to this chamber of distempered green. In the
  end two considerations decided the matter. In the first place,
  meals sent to the room would undoubtedly be charged extra. In the
  second, it was possible that Mrs. De Peyster's remaining in her
  room might rouse suspicion. It seemed the cheaper and safer
  course to try to merge herself, an unnoticed figure, in the
  routine of the house.</p>

  <p>The dining-room was low-ceilinged and occupied the front
  basement and seemed to be ventilated solely through the kitchen.
  Mrs. De Peyster hazily saw perhaps a dozen people; from among
  whom a bare arm, slipping from the sleeve of a pink silk wrapper,
  languidly waved toward a small table. Into the two chairs Mrs.
  Gilbert indicated the twain sank.</p>

  <p>A colored maid who had omitted her collar dropped before Mrs.
  De Peyster a heavy saucer containing three shriveled black
  objects immured in a dark, forbidding liquor that suggested some
  wry tincture from a chemist's shop. In response to Mrs. De
  Peyster's <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id=
  "page127"></a>[pg 127]</span> glance of shrinking inquiry Matilda
  whispered that they were prunes. Next the casual-handed maid
  favored them with thin, underdone oatmeal, and with thin, bitter
  coffee; and last with two stacks of pancakes, which in hardly
  less substantial incarnation had previously been served them by
  every whiff of kitchen air.</p>

  <p>While she pretended to eat this uneatable usurper of her
  dainty breakfasts, Mrs. De Peyster glanced furtively at the
  company. Utterly common. And with such she had to
  associate&mdash;for months, perhaps!&mdash;she who had mixed and
  mingled only with the earth's best!</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gilbert&mdash;naturally Mrs. Gilbert was a
  widow&mdash;did not give Mrs. De Peyster a second glance. The
  other boarders, after their first scrutiny, hardly looked at her
  again. The effect was as if all had turned their backs upon
  her.</p>

  <p>Certainly this was odd behavior.</p>

  <p>Then, in a flash, she understood. They were snubbing her as a
  social inferior!</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster was beginning to flame when the clergyman they
  had glimpsed the night before entered and pronounced a sonorous
  good-morning, all-inclusive, as though intended for a
  congregation. He seated himself at a small table just beyond Mrs.
  De Peyster's and was unfolding his napkin when his eyes fell upon
  Mrs. De Peyster. And then Mrs. De Peyster saw one of the oddest
  changes in a man's face imaginable. Mr. Pyecroft's eyes, which
  had been <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id=
  "page128"></a>[pg 128]</span> large with benedictory roundness,
  flashed with a smile. And then, at an instant's end, his face was
  once more grave and clerically benign.</p>

  <p>But that instant-long look made her shiver. What was in this
  clergyman's mind? She watched him, in spite of
  herself&mdash;strangely fascinated; stole looks at him during
  this meal, and the next, and when they passed upon the stairway.
  He had a confusingly contradictory face, had the Reverend Herbert
  E. Pyecroft&mdash;for such she learned was his full name; a face
  customarily sedate and elderish, and then, almost without
  perceptible change, for swift moments oddly youthful; with a wide
  mouth, which would suddenly twist up at its right corner as
  though from some unholy quip of humor, and whose as sudden
  straightening into a solemn line would show that the unseemly
  humor had been exorcised. In manner he was bland, ornate,
  gestureish, ample; giving the sense that in nothing less
  commodious than a church could he loose his person and his powers
  to their full expression. He was genially familiar; the
  church-man who is a good fellow. Yet never did he let one forget
  the respect that was due his cloth.</p>

  <p>He was at present without a charge, as she learned later. It
  was understood that he was waiting an almost certain call from a
  church in Kansas City.</p>

  <p>As Mrs. De Peyster came out of her room that first Sunday at
  supper-time, there emerged from the room in front of hers the
  Reverend Mr. Pyecroft. He held out his hand, and smiled
  parochially.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id=
  "page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>

  <p>"Ah, Miss Thompson,"&mdash;that was the name she had given the
  landlady,&mdash;"since we are neighbors we should also be
  friends." And on he went, voluminously, in his full, upholstered
  voice.</p>

  <p>Somehow Mrs. De Peyster got away from him. But thereafter he
  spoke to her whenever he could waylay her in the hallway or upon
  the stairs. And his attentions did not stop with words. Flowers,
  even edibles, were continuously found against her door, his card
  among them. The situation somehow recalled to her the queer
  gentleman in shorts who threw vegetables over Mrs. Nickleby's
  garden wall. Mrs. De Peyster felt outraged; she fumed; yet she
  dared not be outspokenly resentful.</p>

  <p>She had at first no inkling of the meaning of these
  attentions. It was Matilda who suggested the dismaying
  possibility.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think, ma'am, he's trying to make love to you?"</p>

  <p>"Make love to me!" rising in horror from one of Mrs. Gilbert's
  veteran "easy"-chairs.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it's that, ma'am," said the troubled Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Matilda! Of all the effrontery!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, it is an insult to you, ma'am. But that may not be
  the worst of it. For if he really falls in love with you, he may
  try to follow you when you get ready to leave."</p>

  <p>"Matilda!" gasped Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, whenever he tried to speak to her in <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span> the
  hallways she shrank from him in both fear and indignation. But
  her rebuffs did not lessen by one ray the smiling amicability of
  his bland countenance He tried to become confidential, tried to
  press toward intimacy; one evening he even had the unbelievable
  audacity to ask if he might call upon her! She flamed with the
  desire to destroy him with a look, a word; Mrs. De Peyster knew
  well how thus to snuff out presuming upstarts. But caution warned
  her that she dared not unloose her powers. So she merely turned
  and fled, choking.</p>

  <p>But the reverend gentleman's unperturbed overtures
  continued.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster and Matilda did not speak of money at first;
  but it was constantly in both their minds as a problem of
  foremost importance. Their failure to buy fresh outfits, as they
  had told Mrs. Gilbert they intended doing, thus supplying
  "baggage" that would be security for their board, caused Mrs.
  Gilbert to regard them with hostile suspicion. Matilda saw
  eviction in their landlady's penciled eyes, and without a word as
  to her intention to Mrs. De Peyster, she slipped out on the third
  day, returned minus her two rings, and handed Mrs. Gilbert ten
  dollars.</p>

  <p>They were secure to the week's end. After that&mdash;?</p>

  <p>Fitfully Mrs. De Peyster pondered this matter of finances. She
  had money so near, yet utterly unreachable. Her house was filled
  with negotiable wealth, but she dared not go near it. Judge
  Harvey <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id=
  "page131"></a>[pg 131]</span> would secure her money gladly; but
  if the previous Friday she could not accept his aid, then a
  thousand times less could she accept it now. To ask his aid would
  be to reveal, not alone her presence in America, but the series
  of undignified experiences which had involved her deeper and
  deeper. That humiliation was unthinkable.</p>

  <p>But on Thursday, locked in their room, they spoke of the
  matter openly.</p>

  <p>"Please, ma'am," said Matilda, who had been maturing a plan,
  "you might make out a check to me, dated last week, before you
  sailed, and I could get it cashed. They'd think it was for back
  wages."</p>

  <p>"I told you last Friday, when everything happened, that I had
  drawn out my balance."</p>

  <p>"But your bank won't mind your overdrawing for a hundred or
  two," urged Matilda.</p>

  <p>"That," said Mrs. De Peyster with an air of noble principle,
  "is a thing I will not do."</p>

  <p>Matilda knew nothing of the secret of Mrs. De Peyster's
  exhausted credit at her bank.</p>

  <p>"My own money," Matilda remarked plaintively, "is all in a
  savings bank. I have to give thirty days' notice before I can
  draw a penny."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Matilda's gaze, which had several
  times wandered to a point a few inches below Mrs. De Peyster's
  throat, now fixed themselves upon this spot. She spoke
  hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"There's your pearl pendant you forgot and kept on when you
  put on my dress to go out riding with <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>
  William." It was not one of the world's famous jewels; yet was of
  sufficient importance to be known, in a limited circle, as "The
  De Peyster Pearl." "I know the chain wouldn't bring much; but you
  could raise a lot on the pearl from a pawnbroker."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster tried to look shocked. "What! I take my pearl
  to a pawnbroker!"</p>

  <p>"Of course, I wouldn't expect you to go to a pawnshop, ma'am,"
  Matilda apologized. "I'd take it."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster had a moment's picture of Matilda's laying the
  pearl before a pawnbroker and asking for a fraction of its worth,
  a mere thousand or two; and of the hard-eyed usurer glancing at
  it, announcing that the pearl was spoof, and offering fifty cents
  upon it.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, you should know that I would not part with such an
  heirloom," she said rebukingly.</p>

  <p>"But, ma'am, in a crisis like this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That will do, Matilda!"</p>

  <p>Matilda said no more about the pearl then. She went to her
  bank and gave due notice of her desire to withdraw her funds.
  That, however, was provision merely for the next month and
  thereafter. It did not help to-day.</p>

  <p>But all the rest of that day, and all of the following, Mrs.
  De Peyster felt Matilda's eyes, aggrieved, bitterly resentful,
  upon the spot where beneath her black housekeeper's dress hung
  the pearl she was unwilling to pawn to save them.</p>

  <p>It was most uncomfortable.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=

  <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <h3>THE REVEREND MR. PYECROFT</h3>

  <p>The next evening, Friday, as they left the dining-room, draped
  with the heavy odor of a dark, mysterious viand which Matilda in
  a whisper had informed Mrs. De Peyster to be pot-roast, Mrs.
  Gilbert stopped them on the stairs. In her most casual, superior
  tone, she notified Mrs. De Peyster that she would thank them for
  another week's pay in advance the following day, or their
  room.</p>

  <p>Here was a crisis that had to be faced at once. Up in their
  room they discussed finance, going over and over their
  predicament, for two hours. There seemed no practical
  solution.</p>

  <p>A heavy rain had begun to fall. The night was hot, close. The
  unaccustomed high collar of Matilda's dress had seemed
  suffocating to Mrs. De Peyster, and she had loosened it, and also
  she had taken off the pearl pendant which had chafed her beneath
  the warm, heavy cloth. The pearl and its delicate chain of
  platinum were now lying on their center-table.</p>

  <p>Several times Matilda's eye had gone furtively toward the
  pendant. "I don't see why," she at length said doggedly, "you
  shouldn't let me pawn that pearl."</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>

  <p>"I believe I have requested you not to refer to this again."
  Mrs. De Peyster's tone was stiff.</p>

  <p>Matilda's face showed stubborn bitterness. But the habit of
  obedience was too old and strong for her to speak further.</p>

  <p>There was another silence. Both sat in desperate thought.
  Suddenly Mrs. De Peyster looked up. "Matilda, I think I have
  it."</p>

  <p>"What is it, ma'am?"&mdash;with faintly reviving hope.</p>

  <p>"You have the keys to my house. You slip back there to-night,
  find my purse, or bring something that you might sell."</p>

  <p>Matilda slumped down, aghast.</p>

  <p>"It's perfectly simple," Mrs. De Peyster reassured her. "We
  should have thought of it at first."</p>

  <p>"But, ma'am!" quaveringly protested Matilda. "Suppose a
  policeman should see me! They watch those closed houses. And
  suppose&mdash;suppose he should shoot!"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, Matilda! No one will see you if you are
  careful."</p>

  <p>"But if&mdash;if&mdash;Mr. Jack should hear me and come down
  and see me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We shall prepare for such an emergency some kind of plausible
  explanation that will satisfy Jack."</p>

  <p>"But, ma'am, please! I don't think I could ever do it!"</p>

  <p>"Matilda, it is the only way"&mdash;in the voice of authority.
  And then more emphatically, and in some <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>
  desperation: "Remember, we have got to do something! We have
  simply got to have money!"</p>

  <p>Matilda was beginning to whimper yieldingly, when a knock
  sounded at their door. They clutched each other, but did not
  answer.</p>

  <p>The knuckles rapped again.</p>

  <p>They continued silent.</p>

  <p>The knock sounded more loudly.</p>

  <p>"It's the landlady, come to throw us out," quaked Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Open the door," ordered Mrs. De Peyster, decorously
  rearranging the throat of her dress, "and tell her she shall have
  her money in the morning."</p>

  <p>Matilda unlocked the door, partially opened it, then fell back
  with a little cry. There entered the Reverend Mr. Pyecroft. He
  smiled at them, put a finger to his lips. Then he locked the door
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"Please leave this instant!" commanded Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"It is not in my nature," he returned in his bland voice, "to
  go and leave behind me fellow creatures in distress."</p>

  <p>"Fellow creatures in distress?" repeated Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"I was passing," said he, "and chanced to overhear you say a
  moment since that you simply had to have money."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster's face filled with suspicion. "You have been
  listening all the while?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page136" id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span>

  <p>"Possibly," said Mr. Pyecroft, with the same bland smile.</p>

  <p>"Eavesdropper!"</p>

  <p>His smile did not alter. "I did not hear very much, really.
  Miss Thompson, may I beg the favor of a few minutes with you
  alone?"</p>

  <p>"Most certainly not!"</p>

  <p>"I am sure when you learn what it is, Miss Thompson, you would
  prefer that it be between yourself and myself."</p>

  <p>"Matilda, don't go!"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders pleasantly. "I had really hoped that
  the matter might be between just you and me, Miss Thompson.
  However, if you prefer Miss Perkins"&mdash;Matilda's name at Mrs.
  Gilbert's&mdash;"to be present, yours is the right to command.
  Shall we be seated?"</p>

  <p>Matilda had already subsided upon her couch. Mrs. De Peyster
  sank into one of the chairs. The Reverend Mr. Pyecroft drew the
  other up to face her and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Miss Thompson," he began, "I have a very serious proposition
  to lay before you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster shrank away. An awful premonition burst upon
  her. It was coming! This impudent, pompous, philandering
  clergyman was about to propose to her! To <i>her!</i> She gave a
  swift horrified glance at Matilda, who gave back a look of
  sympathetic understanding.</p>

  <p>Then Mrs. De Peyster's horror at the indignity <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>
  changed to horror of quite another sort; for the Reverend Mr.
  Pyecroft was leaning confidentially close to her, eyes into hers,
  and was saying in a low voice:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Miss Thompson, you are not aware how much you look
  like a certain great lady, a famous social leader? To be
  explicit, like Mrs. De Peyster?"</p>

  <p>She sank back, mere jelly with a human contour. So she was
  discovered! She rolled her eyes wildly toward Matilda; Matilda
  rolled wild eyes toward her.</p>

  <p>"It is really a remarkable likeness," went on the low voice of
  the Reverend Mr. Pyecroft. "I've seen Mrs. De Peyster, you know;
  not more than six yards away; and the likeness struck me the very
  moment I saw you. You haven't the grand-duchess dignity she had
  on when I saw her&mdash;say, but you should have seen the figure
  she made!&mdash;but it's a wonderful coincidence. Dressed right,
  and with some lofty spirit pumped into you, you could pass
  anywhere as Mrs. De Peyster, provided they did not know Mrs. De
  Peyster too intimately. That likeness is the foundation of my
  proposition."</p>
    <span class=
  "pagenum"></span>
  <hr />
<a name="pageb" id="pageb"></a>
  <div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;">
    <a href="images/no13-3.jpg"><img width="50%" src=
    "images/no13-3.jpg" alt="IT IS REALLY A REMARKABLE LIKENESS" /></a>

    <h4>"IT IS REALLY A REMARKABLE LIKENESS"</h4>
  </div>
  <hr />
  <p>Mrs. De Peyster stared at him, and began to clutch at
  consciousness. After all, was it possible that he hadn't
  recognized her as Mrs. De Peyster? Perhaps he hadn't&mdash;for
  every one knew Mrs. De Peyster was abroad, and, furthermore, all
  the social world yawned inimitably between Mrs. De Peyster and
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg
  138]</span> this apparent nobody that she was, in an obscure
  boarding-house, and in a housekeeper's gown. But if he hadn't
  recognized her, then what was he driving at?</p>

  <p>While she gazed she became aware of an amazing change in his
  face, of the possibility of which she had previously had only
  hints. The bland, elderish, clerical look faded; the face grew
  strangely young, the right corner of his mouth twisted upward,
  and his right eyelid drooped in a prodigious, unreverend
  wink.</p>

  <p>"Friend," he remarked, "what's you two ladies' game?"</p>

  <p>"Our game?" Mrs. De Peyster repeated blankly.</p>

  <p>"Now don't try to come Miss Innocence over me," he said
  easily. "I sized you two up from the first minute, and I've been
  watching you ever since. The other one could get away with the
  housekeeper's part O.K., but any one could see through your
  makeup. What are the bulls after you for?"</p>

  <p>"The&mdash;the what?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, come,&mdash;you're dodging the police, or why the
  disguise?" he queried pleasantly. He picked up Mrs. De Peyster's
  pearl pendant. "Housekeepers don't sport this kind of jewelry.
  What are you? Housebreakers&mdash;sneak thieves&mdash;confidence
  game?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster gaped at him. "I&mdash;I don't
  understand."</p>

  <p>"It's really a pretty fair front you're putting up," he
  commented with a dry indulgent smile. "But
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg
  139]</span> might as well drop it, for you see I'm on. But I
  think I understand." He nodded. "You don't want to admit anything
  until you feel you can trust me. That's about the size of it,
  isn't it, friends?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster stared, without speaking.</p>

  <p>"Now I know I can trust you," he went on easily, "for I've got
  something on you and I give you away if you give me away. Well,
  sisters, of course you know you're not the only people the police
  are after. That's why I am temporarily in the ministry."</p>

  <p>He grinned widely&mdash;a grin of huge enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" demanded Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Well, you don't hesitate to ask, do you?" He laughed,
  lightly. "Say, it's too good to keep! I always was too confiding
  a lad; but I've got you where you won't squeal, and I suppose
  we've got to know each other if we're going to do business
  together. You must know, my dear ladies, that every proposition
  I've handled I've gone into it as much for the fun as for the
  coin." He cocked his head; plainly there was an element of
  conceit in his character. "Well, fair ones&mdash;ready?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster nodded.</p>

  <p>"Ever heard of the American Historical Society's collection of
  recently discovered letters of a gentleman named Thomas
  Jefferson?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster started.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And perhaps you have heard that authorities now agree that
  said Thomas Jefferson was dead almost <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span> a
  hundred years when said letters were penned; and that he must
  have been favored with the assistance of an amanuensis of, so to
  say, the present generation?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That being the case you may have heard of one Thomas Preston,
  alleged to be said amanuensis?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He put his hand across his clerical vest, and bowed first to
  Mrs. De Peyster, then to Matilda.</p>

  <p>"It gives Mr. Preston very great pleasure to meet you, ladies.
  Only for the present he humbly petitions to be known as Mr.
  Pyecroft."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster was quite unable to speak. So this was the man
  Judge Harvey was trying to hunt down! Her meeting him like this,
  it seemed an impossible coincidence&mdash;utterly impossible! She
  little dreamed that the laws of chance were not at all concerned
  in this adventure; that this meeting was but the natural outcome
  of Matilda's trifling act in picking up from the library rug a
  boarding-house card and slipping it into her slit-pocket.</p>

  <p>The young man, for he now obviously was a young man, plainly
  delighted in the surprise he had created.</p>

  <p>"I like to hand it to these pompous old stiffs," he went on
  gleefully&mdash;"these old boys who will come across with
  sky-high prices for old first editions and original manuscripts,
  and who don't care one little wheeze of a damn for what the
  author actually wrote. I'm sorry, though,"&mdash;in a tone of
  genuine <span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id=
  "page141"></a>[pg 141]</span> contrition,&mdash;"that Judge
  Harvey was the man finally to be stung; they say he's the real
  thing." Suddenly his mood changed; his eye dropped in its
  unreverend wink. "There's a Raphael that the Metropolitan is
  solemnly proud of. It cost Morgan a hundred and fifty thousand
  dollars. It cost me an even five hundred to have it made."</p>

  <p>He laughed again: that gay, whimsical, irresponsible laugh.
  Mrs. De Peyster was recovering somewhat from her first
  surprise.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft leaned forward. "But this isn't getting down to
  our business. I've got a plan that's more fun than the Jefferson
  letters, and that will make us a lot of money, Miss Thompson. And
  it's easy and it's sure fire. It depends, as I said, upon the
  remarkable coincidence of your likeness to Mrs. De Peyster."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" Mrs. De Peyster managed to say.</p>

  <p>"You've read of her, of course; stiffest swell of the lot,"
  went on the young gentleman rapidly, in clipped phrases oddly
  unlike the sonorous sentences of the Reverend Mr. Pyecroft.
  "Looks down on most of the Four Hundred as <i>hoi polloi</i>.
  She's in Europe now, and the papers say she won't be back until
  the very end of summer. We can't do a thing till then; have to
  lie low and wait. You need money, I heard you say; I suppose
  you're afraid to hock this twinkler"&mdash;touching the pearl
  pendant. "Police probably watching the pawnshops and would nab
  you. Well, I'll stake you till Mrs. De Peyster comes
  back."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id=
  "page142"></a>[pg 142]</span>

  <p>"Stake me?" breathed Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Give you, both of you, what money you need."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;and when&mdash;Mrs. De Peyster comes back?"</p>

  <p>Young Mr. Pyecroft chortled with delight.</p>

  <p>"Say, this scheme's the best ever! The day we learn Mrs. De
  Peyster has landed, we dress you up as a top-notcher&mdash;gad,
  but we can make you look the part!&mdash;we put you in a swell
  carriage, with her coat of arms painted on it&mdash;and you go
  around to Tiffany's and all the other swell shops where in the
  mean time I'll have learned Mrs. De Peyster has charge accounts.
  You select the most valuable articles in the shop, and then in
  the most casual, dignified manner,&mdash;I can coach you on how
  to put on the dignity,&mdash;you remark, 'Charge to my account,
  and I'll just take it along with me.' And off you go, with a
  diamond necklace under your arm. And same thing at all the shops.
  Then we duck before the thing breaks, and divide the fruits of
  our industry and superior intelligence, as the economists say.
  Isn't that one great little game!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster stared at his face, grinning like an elated
  gargoyle; herself utterly limp, her every nerve a filament of icy
  horror.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you say, girls?" prompted Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster at first could say nothing at all. Whereupon
  the young man, gleeful over his invention, prompted her
  again.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id=
  "page143"></a>[pg 143]</span>

  <p>"I&mdash;can't&mdash;can't do it," she gulped out.</p>

  <p>"Can't do it!" He stared at her, amazed. "Say, do you realize
  what you're passing up?"</p>

  <p>"I can't do it," repeated Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She did not reply.</p>

  <p>He stood up, smiling again. "I won't argue with you; it's
  bigger than anything you ever pulled off&mdash;so big, I guess it
  stuns you; I'll just let the matter soak in, and put up its own
  argument. You'll come in, all right," he continued confidently,
  "for you need money, and I'm the party that can supply you. And
  to make certain that you don't get the money elsewhere, I'll just
  take along this vault of the First National Bank as
  security"&mdash;with which he slipped Mrs. De Peyster's pearl
  pendant into his pocket. "Now, think the matter over, girls. I'll
  be back in half an hour. So-long for the present."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind him.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster gazed wildly after him. The plan "soaked in,"
  as he had said it would; and as it soaked in, her horror grew.
  She saw herself becoming involved, helpless to prevent it, in the
  plan Mr. Pyecroft considered so delectable; she saw herself later
  publicly exposed as engaged in this scheme to defraud herself;
  she could hear all New York laughing. Her whole being shivered
  and gasped. Of all the plans ever proposed to a woman&mdash;!</p>

  <p>And all the weeks and months this Mr. Pyecroft would be
  hovering about her!...</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"
  id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span>

  <p>Despairingly she sat upright.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, we can't stay in the same house with that man."</p>

  <p>"Oh, ma'am," breathed the appalled Matilda, "of course
  not!"</p>

  <p>"We've got to leave! And leave before he comes back!"</p>

  <p>"Of course, ma'am," cried Matilda. And then: "But&mdash;but
  where?"</p>

  <p>"Anywhere to get away from him!"</p>

  <p>"But, ma'am, the money?" said Matilda who had handled Mrs. De
  Peyster's petty cash account for twenty years, and whose business
  it had been to think of petty practicalities. "We've only got
  twenty-three cents left, and we can't possibly get any more soon,
  and no one will take us in without money or baggage. Don't you
  see? We can't stay here, and we can't go any place else."</p>

  <p>This certainly was a dilemma. The two gazed at each other,
  their faces momently growing more ghastly with helplessness. Then
  suddenly Mrs. De Peyster leaned forward, with desperate
  decision.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, we shall go back home!"</p>

  <p>"Go home, ma'am?" cried Matilda.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing else we can do. I'll slip into my
  sitting-room, lock the door, and live there quietly&mdash;and
  Jack will never know I'm in the house."</p>

  <p>"But, ma'am, won't that be dangerous?"</p>

  <p>"Danger is comparative. Anything is better than
  this!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id=
  "page145"></a>[pg 145]</span>

  <p>"Just as you say; I suppose you're right, ma'am." And then
  with an hysterical snuffle: "But oh, ma'am, I wish I knew how
  this thing was ever going to turn out!"</p>

  <p>Five minutes later the two twin figures of somberness, their
  veils down, stole stealthily down the stairs and out into the
  night.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id=
  "page146"></a>[pg 146]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <h3>HOME AGAIN</h3>

  <p>The two dark figures, giving a glance through the rain in
  either direction, stole down beneath the stately marble steps of
  No. 13 Washington Square, and Matilda unlocked the servants'
  door. They slipped inside; the door was cautiously relocked.
  Breathless, they stood listening. A vast, noble silence pervaded
  the great house. They flung their arms about each other, and thus
  embraced tottered against the wall; and Mrs. De Peyster relaxed
  in an unspeakable relief.</p>
  <span class="pagenum"></span>

    <h4>MATILDA UNLOCKED THE SERVANTS' DOOR</h4>
  </div>
  <hr />
  <p>Home again! Her own home! Odorless of pot-roasts and frying
  batter-cakes. The phrase was rather common and
  sentimental&mdash;but, in truth, this was "home, sweet home."</p>

  <p>And free of that unthinkable Mr. Pyecroft!</p>

  <p>While Mrs. De Peyster leaned there in the blackness, gathering
  strength, her mind mounted in sweet expectancy to her suite. Only
  a few minutes of soft treading of stairways&mdash;certainly they
  could avoid arousing Jack&mdash;and she would be locked in her
  comfortable rooms. A cautious bath! Clean clothes! Her own bed!
  All of the luxuries she had been so long denied!</p>

  <p>Cautiously they crept through the basement
  hallway;
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg
  147]</span> cautiously crept up the butler's stairs and turned
  off through the door into the great hall of the first floor;
  cautiously they crept up to the drawing-room floor and trod ever
  so softly over woven treasures of the Orient, through the
  spacious ducal gloom. One more flight, then peace, security. With
  unbreathing care, Mrs. De Peyster set foot upon the first step of
  her journey's end.</p>

  <p>And then, suddenly, the servants' bell burst into ringing. And
  there was a terrific hammering against the servants' door and
  also against the door in the boarding.</p>

  <p>"Matilda&mdash;what's that?" breathed Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"M&mdash;maybe the police saw us come in," breathed
  Matilda.</p>

  <p>They did not pause for discussion. Discarding caution, they
  plunged frantically and noisily up the stairs; until from out of
  the overhead blackness descended a voice:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Stop! Or I'll shoot!"</p>

  <p>It was Jack's voice.</p>

  <p>They stopped.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" the voice demanded.</p>

  <p>They clung to each other, wordless.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" repeated Jack.</p>

  <p>Their voices were still palsied. They heard his feet begin
  determinedly to descend. Mrs. De Peyster loosed her grip on
  Matilda's arm and vanished noiselessly downward.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span>

  <p>"Speak up there," commanded Jack, "or I'll fire on the chance
  of getting you in the dark."</p>

  <p>"It's only me, Mr. Jack," trembled Matilda.</p>

  <p>"What, Matilda!" cried Jack; and from above, like an echo
  transposed an octave higher, sounded another, "What,
  Matilda!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Jack. Yes, ma'a&mdash;yes, Mary."</p>

  <p>"But where the devil have you been?" exclaimed Jack, coming to
  her side.</p>

  <p>Mary had also hurried down to her. "Matilda, the way you ran
  away from us!"</p>

  <p>"I got a&mdash;er&mdash;sudden message. There was no
  time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about explaining now," interrupted Jack. "Go down
  and stop that racket before they break in the doors. And thank
  God you're here just in time, Matilda! You're just the person to
  do it: housekeeper, caretaker. But be careful if they're
  reporters. Now, hurry."</p>

  <p>Jack and Mary scuttled back to the haven of upstairs, and
  Matilda shivered down through the blackness. As she passed
  through the lower hall, a hand reached out of the dark and
  touched her. She managed not to cry out.</p>

  <p>"Don't let them know about me!" implored Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"I'll&mdash;I'll do my best, ma'am," quavered Matilda, and
  glided weakly on.</p>

  <p>When she opened the servants' door, a dripping policeman
  caught her arm. "Down here, Bill," he <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span>
  called to the man battering at the door above; and a minute later
  two officers were inside, and the door was closed, and a light
  was flashing in Matilda's face.</p>

  <p>"Now, old girl," said the first officer, tightly gripping her
  arm and giving it that twist which if a policeman does not give
  an arm he is no policeman, "what's your little game, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I live here, sir. I'm the housekeeper."</p>

  <p>"Now don't try to put that over on us. You know you
  ain't."</p>

  <p>"You must be new policemen, in this neighborhood," trembled
  Matilda, "or you'd know I am."</p>

  <p>"We may be new cops, but we don't fall for old stuff like
  that. I was talkin' to Mrs. De Peyster's coachman only yesterday.
  He told me the housekeeper wasn't here no more. So better change
  your line o' dope. Where's the other one?"</p>

  <p>"Wha&mdash;what other one?"</p>

  <p>"The one what come in here with you."</p>

  <p>"I'm the only person in the house," Matilda tried to declare
  valiantly.</p>

  <p>"Drop it!" said the officer. "Didn't the boss tell us to keep
  our eyes on these here millionaires' closed houses; all kinds o'
  slick crooks likely to clean 'em out. An' didn't we see two women
  come in this house,&mdash;hey, Bill?"</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;I was a block off, but I seen 'em plain as day,"
  said Bill.</p>

  <p>"So I guess," again the twist that proved him a policeman,
  "you'd better lead us to your pal."</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span>

  <p>He pushed her before him, lighting the way with his
  flash-lantern, up stairways and back into the dining-room, where
  she turned on the one shaded electric bulb that had been left
  connected. In Matilda all hope was gone; resistance was useless;
  fate had conquered. And when the officer again demanded that she
  bring forth her accomplice, she dumbly and obediently made
  search; and finally brought Mrs. De Peyster forth from the china
  closet.</p>

  <p>The officer pulled up Mrs. De Peyster's veil, and closely
  scanned her features; which, to be just to the officer, were so
  distorted that they bore little semblance to the Mrs. De Peyster
  of her portraits.</p>

  <p>"Recognize her, Bill?" he queried.</p>

  <p>"Looks a bit like the pictures of Chicago Sal," said Bill.
  "But I ain't ever handled her. I guess she ain't worked none
  around New York."</p>

  <p>"Well, now," said the officer, with policial jocularity,
  "since you two ladies already got your hats on, I guess we'll
  just offer you our arms to the station."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster gave Matilda a look of frenzied appeal. But
  Matilda needed not the spur of another's desperation. For herself
  she saw a prison cell agape.</p>

  <p>"But I tell you I'm Matilda Simpson, Mrs. De Peyster's
  housekeeper!"</p>

  <p>"If so, who's the other mourner?" inquired the humorous
  policeman. "And what's she doin' here?"</p>

  <p>"She's&mdash;she's"&mdash;and then Matilda plunged blindly at
  a lie&mdash;"she's my sister." And having <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span>
  started, she went on: "My sister Angelica, who lives in Syracuse.
  She's come to visit me awhile."</p>

  <p>The officer grinned. "Well, Matilda and Angelica, we'll give
  you a chance to tell that to the lieutenant. Come on."</p>

  <p>"But I tell you I'm Matilda Simpson!" cried Matilda. She was
  now thinking solely of her own imminent disgrace. Inspiration
  came to her. "You say you talked to William, the coachman. He'll
  tell you who I am. There's the bell&mdash;ring for him!"</p>

  <p>The officer scratched his chin. Then he eyed his co-laborer
  meditatively.</p>

  <p>"Not a bad idea, Bill. There's a chance she may be on the
  level, and there'd be hell to pay at headquarters if we got in
  bad with any of these swells. No harm tryin'."</p>

  <p>He pressed a big thumb against the bell Matilda had
  indicated.</p>

  <p>They all sat down, the two officers' oilskins guttering water
  all over Mrs. De Peyster's Kirmanshah rug and parquet floor. But
  Mrs. De Peyster was unconscious of this deluge. She gave Matilda
  a glance of reproachful dismay; then she edged into the dimmest
  corner of the dusky room and turned her chair away from the door
  through which this new disaster was about to stalk in upon her,
  and unnoticed drew down her veil.</p>

  <p>There was a long, sickening wait. Plainly William had gone to
  bed, and had to dress before he could answer the
  bell.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id=
  "page152"></a>[pg 152]</span>

  <p>At length, however, William appeared. He started at sight of
  the four figures; then his gaze fastened on Matilda and grew
  hard. Mrs. De Peyster tried to collapse within herself.</p>

  <p>"Friend," said the officer, "here's a lady as says she's
  Matilda Simpson, Mrs. De Peyster's housekeeper. How about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"She is," William affirmed coldly.</p>

  <p>"The devil!" said the officer; and then in a low voice apart
  to the other: "Lucky we didn't go no further&mdash;hey, Bill?"
  And again to William: "Miss Simpson says this other lady is her
  sister, visitin' her from Syracuse. Can you identify her?"</p>

  <p>William did not alter a line in his face.</p>

  <p>"Miss Simpson has a sister living near Syracuse. I have never
  seen her. I cannot identify her."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said the officer.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" asked William.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that'll do. Thanks."</p>

  <p>With a cold blighting glare at Matilda, William withdrew.</p>

  <p>"Well, ladies," said the officer with ingratiating
  pleasantness, "I'm mighty glad it's all right. If you have
  occasion, Miss Simpson, to speak o' this here little incident to
  Mrs. De Peyster when she gets back from Europe, just explain it
  as due to over-zealousness, if you don't mind&mdash;desire to
  safeguard her interests. D'you get me? Headquarters is awful
  sensitive to kicks from you rich people; and the boss comes down
  on you like a ton o' bricks. It'll be <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span>
  mighty kind o' you. Good-night. Don't bother to come down with
  us. I noticed it was a spring lock. We can let ourselves
  out."</p>

  <p>When the two policemen were out of the room, Mrs. De Peyster
  and Matilda collapsed into each others' arms and their bodies
  sank limply forward from their chairs upon the dining-table.
  "Matilda, what an escape!" shivered Mrs. De Peyster; and she lay
  there, gathering breath, regathering strength, regathering poise,
  while the officers' steps grew dimmer and more dim. She was
  palpitant, yet able to think. Certainly it had been a narrow
  escape. But that danger was now over. There now remained only the
  feat of getting into her room, unnoticed by Jack. This they could
  manage when they were certain that Jack and Mary were asleep.</p>

  <p>Relief, hope, courage once more began to rise within her.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly she sat upright. Footsteps were sounding
  below&mdash;growing nearer&mdash;heavy footsteps&mdash;what
  sounded like more than two pairs of footsteps. She sat as one
  palsied; and before she could recover strength or faculties,
  there in the doorway were the two policemen. And with them was a
  gentleman in a cap and tan summer overcoat buttoned to the
  chin.</p>

  <p>The gentleman was the Reverend Mr. Pyecroft; and the Mr.
  Pyecroft they had first seen: bland, oh, so bland, with that odd,
  elderish look of his.</p>

  <p>"Met him goin' down the servants' steps as we <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span> were
  goin' out, and he asked us&mdash;" the officer was beginning.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Pyecroft was already crossing toward Matilda, smiling
  affectionately.</p>

  <p>"My dear Matilda!" He kissed her upon the cheek. "I arrived in
  New York very unexpectedly less than half an hour ago, and could
  not delay coming to see you. How are you, sister?"</p>

  <p>"Wha&mdash;what?" stammered Matilda.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft with his bland affectionate smile crossed to Mrs.
  De Peyster, slipped an arm across her shoulders and kissed her
  veil somewhere about the forehead. "And how are you, dear
  sister?" he inquired with deep concern.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster gasped and stiffened.</p>

  <p>"You ladies don't seem very glad to see him," put in the
  officer. "When we told him about you two bein' sisters, he said
  he was your brother. Is he?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am," Mr. Pyecroft answered pleasantly. "They
  weren't expecting me; therefore this very natural surprise which
  you observe. Of course, I am your brother, am I
  not?"&mdash;patting Mrs. De Peyster's arm with the appearance of
  affection, and then closing on it warningly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster nodded her head.</p>

  <p>"Matilda," turning to her, in frank fraternal fashion, "you
  might tell these officers that I am not only your brother, but in
  fact the only brother you have. That is true, isn't it,
  sister?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," gulped Matilda.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page155" id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span>

  <p>"Well," said the officer, "since everything is all right,
  we'll be leavin' you. But, believe me, this is certainly some
  sudden family reunion."</p>

  <p>When they had gone Mr. Pyecroft calmly removed cap and
  overcoat and stood forth in his clericals. Again he wore the
  youngish face of their interview of an hour before. Mrs. De
  Peyster watched him in sickening fear. What was he going to do?
  Surely he must now know her identity!</p>

  <p>He smiled at them amiably.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dears, so you tried to give me the slip. I rather
  thought you'd bear watching, so I followed you. And when I saw
  the officers come out without you I knew you had successfully
  entertained them with some sort of plausible explanation."</p>

  <p>His gaze fixed on Matilda. "So, my dear sister, you're really
  the housekeeper here." He shook his head chidingly. "And the
  usual crook of a housekeeper, eh&mdash;trying to make a safe
  clean-up while her mistress is away. You're deeper than I
  thought, Matilda. I understand the whole affair now. You and our
  sister Angelica had already been planning some kind of a game
  similar to the one I suggested. I just happened to think of the
  same thing. I don't blame you a lot for not wanting to take me
  into the game; it was quite natural for you to want all there is
  in it for yourselves. Not the least hard feeling in the world, my
  dears. But, of course,"&mdash;apologetically,&mdash;"you could
  hardly expect me to give up a rich thing like this, could
  you?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id=
  "page156"></a>[pg 156]</span>

  <p>His easy, familiar, ironic talk had brought Mrs. De Peyster
  one large item of relief. Evidently he didn't suspect who she
  was&mdash;yet.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" she managed to ask.</p>

  <p>"Stay right here with you, my sisters, and in due time we'll
  go ahead with our game as per previous specifications." He
  surveyed the high, paneled dining-room, sumptuous, distinguished
  even in the semi-dusk. "Cozy little flat, eh, my dears?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly that wide mouth of his slipped up to one side, and he
  laughed in exultant, impish glee.</p>

  <p>"Say, isn't this the funniest ever! Beats my plan a mile.
  We'll make ourselves at home&mdash;hang out together for the
  summer in Mrs. De Peyster's own house,&mdash;<i>her own
  house</i>,&mdash;and when we hear she's coming back we vacate and
  then do our little act of buying out the stores in Lady De
  Peyster's name. Was there ever such a lark!" For a moment his low
  laugh of wild glee cut off his speech. "What's more, it's the
  safest place in the world for us. Nobody'd ever think of our
  being here!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster stared at Matilda, Matilda stared at Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>"And it's just what I needed," continued Mr. Pyecroft in
  amicable confidence. "I just had a tip that the police were
  closing in on me, and I had to disappear quick. An hour ago, I'd
  never have dreamed of falling into such a safe little retreat as
  this. Luck favors the deserving."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster gazed at him, faint.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span>

  <p>"And of course, Matilda," he went on, "if, say, any of the
  neighbors happen to drop in for a cup of tea and see me, or if
  the police should manage to trail me here,&mdash;and they may,
  you know,&mdash;of course, Matilda, you'll speak right up and say
  I'm your dear brother."</p>

  <p>At that moment it was beyond either of them to speak right
  up.</p>

  <p>"Remember, my dears, that we're all crooks together," he
  prompted in a soft voice, that had a steely suggestion beneath
  it. "And in case you fail to stand by me it would give me very
  great pain&mdash;very great pain, I assure you&mdash;to have to
  blow on you."</p>

  <p>Matilda gulped, blinked her eyes, and looked helplessly at
  Mrs. De Peyster. Mr. Pyecroft turned to the latter.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Angelica, dear, you're going to stand by me?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster hesitated, then breathed a barely audible
  "Yes."</p>

  <p>"And you, Matilda, who were always my favorite sister, you,
  too, will stand by me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," breathed Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Mr. Pyecroft, in a moved tone, "such family loyalty
  is truly touching. I foresee a most pleasant
  summer."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id=
  "page158"></a>[pg 158]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <h3>THE HAPPY FAMILY</h3>

  <p>He nodded at the two with an air of deep fraternal affection.
  And again he gazed with satisfaction about the spacious
  apartment, indicative of numberless other rooms of corresponding
  comfort.</p>

  <p>His eyes came back to them.</p>

  <p>"And now, Matilda, my dear," he resumed, with his pleasant
  smile, "in the event we spoke of,&mdash;neighbors or police
  dropping in, you know,&mdash;in such a case I suppose I ought to
  be prepared with a correct history of myself. To begin with,
  might I inquire what our name is?&mdash;our family name, I
  mean."</p>

  <p>"Simpson."</p>

  <p>"Simpson. Ah, yes; very good. Matilda Simpson&mdash;Angelica
  Simpson&mdash;and, let us say, Archibald Simpson. And where was I
  born, Matilda?"</p>

  <p>"You weren't ever born," protested Matilda with frightened
  indignation.</p>

  <p>"Now don't be facetious or superfluous, sister dear," he said
  soothingly. "Granted for the sake of argument I wasn't ever born.
  But where might I have been born?"</p>

  <p>"I was born near Albany."</p>

  <p>"Near Albany is perfectly agreeable to me," said <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span> Mr.
  Pyecroft. "And how many are there in our family?"</p>

  <p>"Just Angelica and me."</p>

  <p>"Then there really is an authentical Angelica?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Excellent. And our parents?"</p>

  <p>"They died when I was a child."</p>

  <p>"I'm grieved, indeed, to learn of it," said Mr. Pyecroft. "But
  I'll admit it simplifies matters; there's less to remember.
  Angelica, our sister here, who is also visiting you, lives near
  Syracuse I understood some one to say. Married or single?"</p>

  <p>"Married," Matilda choked out.</p>

  <p>"Her married name?"</p>

  <p>"Jones."</p>

  <p>"Angelica Simpson Jones. Good. Very euphonious. And how many
  little nieces and nephews am I the happy uncle of?"</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;she has no children."</p>

  <p>"That's too bad, for I have a particular fondness for
  children," sorrowed Mr. Pyecroft. "Still, that also simplifies
  matters, lessening considerably the percentage of chances for
  regrettable lapses of memory."</p>

  <p>He pursued his genealogical inquiries into all possibly useful
  details. And then he sat meditative for a while, gazing amiably
  about his family circle. And it was while they were all thus
  sitting silent, in what in the dim light of the one shaded
  electric bulb might have seemed to an observer the silence of
  intimacy, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id=
  "page160"></a>[pg 160]</span> that Jack, who had slipped
  cautiously downstairs, walked in, behind him Mary.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, what's this mean?" he demanded, with a bewildered
  look. "We've been wondering why you didn't come upstairs."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster turned in her chair, and held her breath, like
  one beneath the guillotine. Matilda arose, shaking.</p>

  <p>"Who's this man, Matilda?" Jack continued.</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;he's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And, pray, Matilda, who is this?" politely inquired the
  arisen Mr. Pyecroft, blandly assuming command of the
  situation.</p>

  <p>"Who am I? Well, you certainly have nerve&mdash;" the
  astounded Jack was beginning.</p>

  <p>"He's Mr. Jack," Matilda put in. "Jack De Peyster."</p>

  <p>"Ah, young Mr. De Peyster!" Mr. Pyecroft's eyebrows went up
  slightly and a shrewd light flashed into his rounded eyes and was
  at once gone, and again his face was blandly clerical. "It is,
  indeed, a pleasure to meet you, Mr. De Peyster. And, pray, who
  is this?" with a suave gesture toward Mary.</p>

  <p>"That, sir, is my wife!" Jack announced, stiff with anger.</p>

  <p>Again Mr. Pyecroft's eyes flashed shrewdly, and again were
  clerically rounded.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, that is, indeed, surprising. I have seen no
  public notice of your marriage. And I watch the marriage
  announcements quite closely&mdash;which <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span> is
  rather natural, for, if I may be permitted to mention it, I
  myself am frequently called upon to perform the holy rites." His
  face clouded with what seemed a painful suspicion. "I trust, sir,
  that you are really married?"</p>

  <p>"Why, damn you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sir, you must not thus address the cloth!" sternly interposed
  Mr. Pyecroft. "It is our duty to speak frankly, and to make due
  inquiry into the propriety of such relations. However, since you
  say so, I am sure the affair is strictly correct." His voice
  softened, became nobly apologetic. "No harm has been meant, and
  if any offense has been felt, I assure you of my deepest
  regrets."</p>

  <p>"See here, who the devil are you?" demanded Jack.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft turned to Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, my dear, will you kindly tell young Mr. De Peyster
  who I am."</p>

  <p>Matilda seemed about to choke. "He's&mdash;he's my&mdash;my
  brother."</p>

  <p>"Your brother!" exclaimed Jack, "I didn't know you had a
  brother. You never spoke of one."</p>

  <p>"Which was entirely natural," said Mr. Pyecroft, with an air
  of pious remorse. "Matilda has been ashamed to speak of me. To be
  utterly frank&mdash;and it is meet that one who has been what I
  have been should be humble and ready to confess&mdash;for many
  years I was the black sheep of the family, my name unmentioned.
  But sometime since I was snatched a <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span>
  brand from the burning; I have remained silent about myself until
  I could give to my family, which had properly disowned me, a long
  record to prove my reformation. I am now striving by my devotion
  to make some amends for my previous shortcomings."</p>

  <p>Jack stared incomprehensibly at this unexpected clerical
  brother of Matilda's, with his unquenchable volubility. Mr.
  Pyecroft gazed back with appropriate humility, yet with a lofty
  self-respect.</p>

  <p>Jack turned away with a shrug, and pointed at the dark figure
  of Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"And who is that, Matilda?"</p>

  <p>"That, sir," put in Mr. Pyecroft quickly, easily, to forestall
  any blunder by the hapless Matilda&mdash;and deftly interposing
  himself between Jack and Mrs. De Peyster, "that is our
  sister."</p>

  <p>"The one who lives in Syracuse?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and she is indisposed," said Mr. Pyecroft. "Our sister
  Angelica Simpson Jones," he elaborated. "Matilda is the eldest, I
  am the youngest; there are just us three children."</p>

  <p>"And might I ask, Matilda, without intending discourtesy,"
  said Jack, eyeing Mr. Pyecroft with disfavor, "how long your
  brother and sister intend to remain?"</p>

  <p>"Matilda invited us for the summer," said Mr. Pyecroft
  apologetically.</p>

  <p>"For the summer!" repeated Jack in dismay. Then he spoke to
  Matilda, caustically: "I suppose <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page163" id="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span> it's all right,
  Matilda, but has it been your fixed custom, when we've been away
  for the summer, to fill the house with your family?"</p>

  <p>"Please, Mr. Jack, please," imploringly began Matilda, and
  could utter nothing further.</p>

  <p>"Great God!" Jack burst out in exasperation. "Not that I'd
  object ordinarily to your relatives being here, Matilda. But
  running this place just now as a hotel, who knows but it may let
  out the fact that we're here!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft's eyebrows went up&mdash;ever so little.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I understand. You wish your presence in the house to be a
  secret."</p>

  <p>"Of course! Hasn't Matilda told you?"</p>

  <p>"I only just arrived. She hasn't had time. But of course she
  would have done so. You are&mdash;ah"&mdash;his tone was
  delicate&mdash;"evading the police?"</p>

  <p>"The police! We don't care a hang about the police, though, of
  course, we don't want them to know. It's the infernal reporters
  we care about."</p>

  <p>"The reporters?" softly pursued Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but one reporter in particular&mdash;a beast by the name
  of Mayfair, I've had a tip that he suspects something; already
  he's tried to get into the house as a gas-meter inspector."</p>

  <p>At the mention of that indomitable, remorseless, undeceivable
  newsgatherer, Mayfair, and the possibility of his gaining
  entrance into the house, Mrs. De Peyster experienced a new
  shudder.</p>

  <p>"What would be the harm if Mr. Mayfair did get <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span> in?"
  Imperceptibly prodded Mr. Pyecroft. "He would merely write a
  piece about you for his paper."</p>

  <p>"And his confounded piece, or the main facts in it, would be
  cabled to Europe!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, I think I see," said Mr. Pyecroft. "Mrs. De Peyster would
  read about your marriage in the Paris 'Herald' or some other
  European paper. You do not wish your mother to know of your
  marriage&mdash;yet."</p>

  <p>"I supposed Matilda had already told you that," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"Ah, so that is why you are here in hiding," said Mr.
  Pyecroft, very softly, chiefly to himself; and his eyes had
  another momentary flash, only brighter than any heretofore, and
  his mouth twitched upward, and he pleasantly rubbed his
  hands.</p>

  <p>At that moment, from the stairway, came the sound of
  descending steps. Jack and Mary appeared undisturbed. Mr.
  Pyecroft became taut, though no one could have observed a change,
  Mrs. De Peyster quivered with yet deeper apprehension. Would the
  trials and tribulations and Pharaonic plagues never cease
  descending on her!</p>

  <p>Matilda gazed wildly at Jack. "Who's that?" she quavered.</p>

  <p>"Only Uncle Bob," Jack answered carelessly.</p>

  <p>Only Uncle Bob! Mrs. De Peyster, in her dim corner, tried to
  shrivel up into yet darker obscurity. Breathlessly she felt
  herself upon the precipitous edge of ultimate horror. For Judge
  Harvey&mdash;Judge <span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id=
  "page165"></a>[pg 165]</span> Harvey of all persons&mdash;to be
  the one to discover her amid her humiliating circumstances!</p>

  <p>Dimly she heard Jack talk on, explaining in casual tone: "You
  know, Matilda, Uncle Bob has always had the general oversight of
  the house when it's been closed during summers; and he's always
  made it his business to drop in occasionally to see that
  everything's all right. I got him word we were here, and he
  dropped in this evening to call on us&mdash;and along came this
  awful rain and we coaxed him to stay the night. Uncle Bob and you
  are lucky, Matilda, you can both come and go without arousing any
  suspicion."</p>

  <p>Only the Judge!... Yet, for all her horror, a new phase of the
  general predicament filtered into such consciousness as she now
  possessed. Judge Harvey, irate purchaser of autograph letters,
  and Mr. Pyecroft, <i>alias</i> Thomas Preston, profuse producer
  of the same, were under the same roof and were about to meet.
  What would happen when they came face to face?&mdash;for she
  remembered now that a bad likeness of Thomas Preston had several
  times appeared in the papers. She turned her head toward the
  doorway and peered through her veil, waiting.</p>

  <p>When Judge Harvey entered, Mr. Pyecroft started. Upon the
  instant he had recognized Judge Harvey. But the next moment Mr.
  Pyecroft was himself. Jack gave the necessary introductions, the
  one to Angelica Simpson Jones at long distance, and gave a brief
  explanation of the presence of the two <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span>
  guests. During this while Judge Harvey repeatedly glanced at Mr.
  Pyecroft, a puzzled look on his countenance.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Simpson," he remarked presently, "but your
  face seems elusively familiar to me. I seem to know it, yet I
  cannot place it. Haven't I met you somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you were a lay delegate to the recent Episcopal
  Convention in New York?" politely suggested Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>"No. I did not even attend any of the sessions."</p>

  <p>"Then, of course, it could not have been there that you saw
  me," said Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it will come to me," said Judge Harvey.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster, for all her personal apprehension, could but
  marvel at this young man of the sea who had fastened himself upon
  her back. Most amazing of all, he seemed to like the taste of his
  danger.</p>

  <p>"Judge Harvey, Mr. De Peyster was remarking when you came in,"
  Mr. Pyecroft continued without permitting a lull, "that he wished
  his presence in this house to remain unknown. Also I had just
  told him and his young wife that my earlier years were given over
  to a life for which I have been trying to atone by good works.
  Now I have a very humiliating further confession to make to you
  all. Recently there has been&mdash;may I call it a
  recrudescence?&mdash;an uncontrollable recrudescence of my former
  regrettable <span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id=
  "page167"></a>[pg 167]</span> self. For a disastrous moment the
  Mr. Hyde element in me, which I thought I had stifled and cast
  out, arose and possessed me. In brief, I have been guilty of an
  error which the police consider serious; in fact, the police are
  this moment searching for me. So you see, I am in the same
  situation as Mr. De Peyster: I prefer my whereabouts to remain
  unknown. Since we are in each other's hands, and it is in our
  power each to betray the other, shall we not all, as a <i>quid
  pro quo</i>, agree to preserve Mr. De Peyster's and my presence
  in this house a secret? For my part, I promise."</p>

  <p>"I'm willing," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"And I," said Mary. "Anyhow, I never get a chance to tell, for
  I haven't been out of this house once."</p>

  <p>"And you, Judge Harvey? You will&mdash;ah&mdash;protect
  me?"</p>

  <p>Judge Harvey bit the end of his mustache. "I don't like this
  bargaining over a matter of justice. But&mdash;for Jack's sake,
  yes."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Judge Harvey," Mr. Pyecroft said in a soft,
  grateful voice, and with a slight, dignified bow.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster drew a deep breath. He certainly was a cool
  one.</p>

  <p>"There's something that's just been occurring to me," spoke up
  Jack. "It's along of that infernal reporter Mayfair who's
  snooping around here. He's likely to get in here any time. If he
  were to find me <span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id=
  "page168"></a>[pg 168]</span> here alone, there'd be nothing for
  him to write about. It's finding me here, married, that will give
  him one of his yellow stories, and that will put mother next.
  Matilda, since you already have so large a family visiting you, I
  suppose you wouldn't mind taking on one more and saying that Mary
  here was something or other of yours&mdash;say a niece?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that would be delicious" laughed Mary.</p>

  <p>"Why, Mr. Jack,&mdash;I! I&mdash;" The flustered Matilda could
  get out no more.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Simpson, couldn't you say she was your daughter?" queried
  Jack.</p>

  <p>"I would be only too delighted to own her as such," said Mr.
  Pyecroft. "But I am not married and I am obviously too young.
  However,"&mdash;moving closer to Mrs. De Peyster,&mdash;"our
  sister Angelica is married, and I am sure it will be a great
  pleasure to her to claim Mrs. De Peyster as her daughter.
  Angelica, my dear, of course you'll do it?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster sat rigid, voiceless.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Mary, in deep concern.</p>

  <p>"Our sister probably did not hear, she is slightly deaf," Mr.
  Pyecroft explained. He bent over Mrs. De Peyster, made a trumpet
  of one hand, and raised his voice. "Angelica, if any other person
  comes into the house, you are to say that young Mrs. De Peyster
  is your daughter. You understand?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster nodded.</p>

  <p>"And of course you'll say it?"</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span>

  <p>For a moment Mrs. De Peyster was again rigid. Then slowly she
  nodded.</p>

  <p>The spirit of the masquerade seized upon Mary. "Oh, mother
  dear,&mdash;what a comfort to have you!" she cried with
  mischievous glee; and arms wide as if for a daughterly embrace
  she swept toward Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster shriveled back. She stopped living. In another
  moment&mdash;</p>

  <p>But the Reverend Mr. Pyecroft, <i>alias</i> Archibald Simpson,
  <i>alias</i> Thomas Preston, <i>alias</i> God knows what else,
  stepped quickly between her and the on-coming Mary, and with an
  air of brotherly concern held out an intercepting hand.</p>

  <p>"No excitement, please. The doctor's orders."</p>

  <p>"Is it anything serious?" Mary asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"We hope not," in a grave voice. "It is chiefly nervous
  exhaustion due to a period of worry over a trying domestic
  situation."</p>

  <p>"That's too bad!" Very genuine sympathy was in Mary's soft
  contralto. "But if she's unwell, she ought to have more air. Why
  don't you draw up that heavy veil?"</p>

  <p>"S-s-h! Not so loud, I beg you. If she heard you speak of her
  veil, it would pain her greatly. You see," Mr. Pyecroft
  unhesitatingly went on in a low, compassionate tone, "our sister,
  while trying to light a gasoline stove&mdash;It was a gasoline
  stove, was it not, Matilda?"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;er&mdash;ye-yes," corroborated
  Matilda.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id=
  "page170"></a>[pg 170]</span>

  <p>"A gasoline stove, yes," continued the grave voice of Mr.
  Pyecroft. "It was during the very first year after her marriage.
  The explosion that followed disfigured her face frightfully. She
  is extremely sensitive; so much so that she invariably wears a
  heavy veil when she goes out of her own house."</p>

  <p>"Why, how terrible!" cried Mary.</p>

  <p>"Yes, isn't it! All of our family have felt for poor Angelica
  most deeply. And furthermore, she is sensitive about her
  deafness&mdash;which, I may add, was caused by the same accident.
  And her various misfortunes have made her extremely shy, so the
  less attention that is paid to her, the happier the poor creature
  is."</p>

  <p>Mary withdrew among the others. Slowly Mrs. De Peyster
  returned once more to life. She hardly knew how she had escaped,
  save that it had been through some miracle of that awful Mr.
  Pyecroft's amazing tongue.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Matilda," she heard Mary remark, "did you read in
  to-night's papers about Mrs. De Peyster's voyage? You know she
  landed to-day."</p>

  <p>"No, ma'&mdash;Mary," said Matilda.</p>

  <p>"The paper said she was so ill all the way across that she
  wasn't able to leave her stateroom once." Mary's voice was very
  sympathetic. "Why, she was so ill she couldn't leave the boat
  until after dark, hours after all the other passengers had
  gone."</p>

  <p>"I never knew mother to be seasick before," said Jack, in deep
  concern.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id=
  "page171"></a>[pg 171]</span>

  <p>Judge Harvey said nothing, but his fine, handsome face was
  disturbed. Jack noted the look, and, suddenly catching the
  Judge's hand, said with a burst of boyish frankness:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Uncle Bob, you're worried more than any of us! You know I've
  always liked you like a father&mdash;and&mdash;and here's hoping
  some day mother'll change her mind&mdash;and you'll be my father
  in reality!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Jack!" the Judge said huskily, gripping Jack's
  hand.</p>

  <p>Over in her corner, beneath her veil, Mrs. De Peyster flushed
  hotly.</p>

  <p>They talked on about the distant Mrs. De Peyster, and she
  listened with keenest ears. They were all so sympathetic about
  her&mdash;sick&mdash;alone&mdash;in far-off Europe. So
  sympathetic&mdash;so very, very sympathetic!</p>

  <p>As for Mr. Pyecroft, standing on guard beside her, he looked
  appropriately grave. But inside his gravity he was smiling. These
  people had no guess that in a way he was connected with the great
  Mrs. De Peyster of whom they talked&mdash;that "Miss Gardner" who
  was the companion to the ailing social leader in France was
  something more than just Miss Gardner. And he felt no reason for
  revealing his little secret.... Clara, the dear little Puritan,
  would be scandalized by this his wildest escapade&mdash;by his
  having used, after all and despite her prohibition, Mrs. De
  Peyster's closed house as a retreat; but when she came back from
  Europe, and he made her <span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"
  id="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span> see in its proper light this
  gorgeous and profitable lark, she would relent and forgive him.
  Why, of course, she would forgive him.</p>

  <p>He was very optimistic, was Mr. Pyecroft; and the founder of
  his family must have been a certain pagan gentleman by the name
  of Pan.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id=
  "page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <h3>THE ATTIC ROOM</h3>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster gave thanks when at last, toward one o'clock
  Jack and Mary and Judge Harvey went back to bed, leaving Matilda,
  Mr. Pyecroft, and herself. It had previously been settled that
  Mr. Pyecroft was to have Jack's old room, Matilda was, of course,
  to have her usual quarters, and Mrs. De Peyster was to have the
  room adjoining Matilda's, that formerly was occupied by Mrs. De
  Peyster's second maid.</p>

  <p>"Say, that was certainly one close shave," Mr. Pyecroft
  whispered at the door of her room. "Perhaps we'd better beat it
  from here. If that Judge ever places me! And you, if those people
  ever get a fair look at your face, they'll see your likeness to
  Mrs. De Peyster and they'll guess what our game is&mdash;sure!
  You'll promise to be careful?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster promised.</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes later, having been undressed by Matilda, she
  was lying in the dark on a narrow bed, hard, very hard, as hard
  as Mrs. Gilbert's folding contrivance&mdash;and once more, after
  this her second move, she was studying the items of her
  situation.</p>

  <p>She had daily to mix with, strive to avoid, Jack <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span> and
  Mary. And Jack had casually remarked that Judge Harvey would be
  frequently dropping in.</p>

  <p>And there was that bland, incorrigible Pyecroft, whom she
  seemed to have become hopelessly tied to; Pyecroft, irresistibly
  insisting that she should swindle herself, and whom she saw no
  way of denying.</p>

  <p>Suppose Pyecroft should find out? He might.</p>

  <p>Suppose Jack and Mary should find out? They might.</p>

  <p>Suppose Judge Harvey should find out? He might.</p>

  <p>And suppose all this business of her not going to Europe, but
  staying in her shuttered house&mdash;her flight from
  home&mdash;her humiliating experiences in an ordinary
  boarding-house where she passed as a housekeeper&mdash;her being
  forced into a plan to rob herself&mdash;suppose Mrs. Allistair
  should find out? And Mrs. Allistair, she well knew, might somehow
  stumble upon all this; for she remembered how Mrs. Allistair had
  tried, and perhaps was still trying, to get some piquant bit of
  evidence against her in that Duke de Cr&amp;#233;cy affair. And
  if Mrs. Allistair did find out&mdash;</p>

  <p>What a scandal!</p>

  <p>And since her fate had become so inextricably tied up with the
  fates of others, and since the exposure of others might involve
  the exposure of her, there were yet further sources of danger.
  For&mdash;</p>

  <p>There was that awful reporter watching the house, after
  Jack!</p>

  <p>There were the police, after Pyecroft!</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span>

  <p>She shuddered. This was only the seventh day since her
  inspired idea had been born within her. And it was only that very
  day that she had landed at Cherbourg. Three months must pass
  before Olivetta, in the role of Mrs. De Peyster, would return,
  and she could be herself again&mdash;if they could ever, ever
  manage their expected re-exchange of personalities in this awful
  mess.</p>

  <p>Only seven days thus far. Three more months of this!</p>

  <p>Three ... more ... months!...</p>

  <p>But at length she slept; slept deeply, for she had the gift of
  sleep in its perfection; slept a complete and flawless oblivion.
  So that when she awoke Saturday, refreshed, and glanced blinking
  about from her thin pillow she did not at first remember where
  she was. This low room, four by seven feet, with a narrow bed
  penitentially hard, a stationary wash-basin, a row of iron
  clothes-hooks, a foot-high oblong window above her
  head&mdash;what was it? How had she come here? And had any one
  ever before lived in such a cell?</p>

  <p>Then memory came flooding back. This was her second maid's
  room. She was Angelica Simpson Jones, sister of Matilda, a poor,
  diffident creature with defective hearing and pitifully
  disfigured face. And in the house were Mr. Pyecroft, and Jack and
  Mary, and Judge Harvey was a frequent visitor. And besides these,
  there were all the other sources of danger!</p>

  <p>She was now poignantly awake.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span>

  <p>While she was still in this process of realization, there was
  a soft knock at her door and a whispered, "It's Matilda, ma'am,"
  at her keyhole. She unlocked the door, admitted Matilda, and
  crept back into her second maid's bed. They gazed at each other a
  moment without speaking. Matilda's face was gray with awe and
  helpless woe.</p>

  <p>They whispered about their predicament. What should they do?
  Should they flee again?&mdash;and how?&mdash;and where?&mdash;and
  what good would flight do them, especially since Mr. Pyecroft
  might once more follow? Twice they had leaped from the
  frying-pan, and each time had landed in a fire hotter than the
  one preceding. A third flight might drop them into a fire worse
  even than this in which they now sizzled.</p>

  <p>And as for the specific plan which had brought them
  back&mdash;for Mrs. De Peyster to steal unnoticed into her suite
  and hide there&mdash;that seemed impossible of achievement with
  all these people circulating about the house, especially that
  all-observing Mr. Pyecroft. If Mr. Pyecroft should catch her in
  one suspicious move, then his quick mind would deduce the rest,
  and everything would be up&mdash;everything!</p>

  <p>There was, of course, yet another way&mdash;to give up and
  disclose her identity herself. But she was now far, far too
  deeply involved: to confess and thus by her own act bring
  limitless and appalling humiliation on herself, this was
  unthinkable! She must go on, on, blindly on&mdash;with the
  desperate hope that in some manner now unseen she might in the
  end <span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg
  177]</span> disentangle herself and come out of the affair
  undiscovered and with dignity untarnished. The two were still
  whispering over their predicament, when at the door sounded
  another knock, loud and confident. They caught at each other. The
  knocking was repeated.</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" Matilda asked, at Mrs. De Peyster's
  prompting.</p>

  <p>"It's Archibald," answered a bland voice.</p>

  <p>"Ma'am, shall I let him in?" breathed Matilda.</p>

  <p>"We don't dare keep him out," breathed Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>Matilda admitted him. Even in the semi-darkness of the room,
  due to the green shutters being closed, Mrs. De Peyster could see
  that he was admirably transformed from the raven Mr. Pyecroft of
  the night before. He had on a gray modish suit, with lavender tie
  and socks to match; and looked natty and young and spirited and
  quite prepared for anything.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, sisters," he greeted them pleasantly. "I see
  you are admiring my new spring outfit. Not at all bad, is it?" He
  turned slowly about, for their better observation; then grinned
  and lowered his voice: "It's young De Peyster's; found it in his
  room, and helped myself. Burned my clergyman's outfit in the
  kitchen range before any one was up; best to leave no clues lying
  around."</p>

  <p>He, too, had come to talk plans, and quickly Mr. Pyecroft
  settled them. This was a dangerous place <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg 178]</span> for
  him, with Judge Harvey coming and going; but to stay here was a
  safer risk than to venture forth until the hue and cry of the
  police had quieted. It was a dangerous place also for his dear
  sister Angelica, but if on the plea of indisposition she would
  stay in this dusky room and would keep her disfigured face hidden
  when any member of the household chanced to come in (they would
  all understand, and sympathize with, her painful diffidence),
  why, there was an excellent chance of her pulling through without
  discovery. It was obvious that they dared not keep out Jack and
  Mary, and perhaps Judge Harvey, should these be inspired to make
  friendly calls. To forbid their visits would arouse suspicion.
  And if it were said Angelica was too ill to see any one, then
  they would demand that a doctor be called in&mdash;and a doctor
  would mean exposure. Their visits must be permitted; no doubt of
  that; but if dear Angelica were only careful, extremely careful,
  and kept her head, all would go well.</p>

  <p>Yes, summarized Mr. Pyecroft, the best plan for them was to
  remain here for the present. Then when the safe and appropriate
  moment arrived, they could make their get-away.</p>

  <p>From quite other reasons, Mrs. De Peyster accepted this plan.
  After the strain of the past week, particularly after the wild
  emotional oscillations of the preceding night, she wished just to
  lie there in the dusk, and breathe&mdash;and breathe&mdash;and
  breathe some more&mdash;and recover life.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span>

  <p>Matilda suggested that she bring up breakfast for Mrs. De
  Peyster, and Mr. Pyecroft begged her to discover and set out
  something below for him, for his stomach was a torturing vacuum.
  Matilda went down, leaving Mr. Pyecroft behind in the room,
  discussing further details of their immediate campaign; and
  presently she returned, trembling, with a tray, Jack and Mary
  just behind her. Mrs. De Peyster did not need to be prompted to
  turn her face toward the wall, and into the deeper shadow that
  there prevailed. Mr. Pyecroft casually sat down upon the bed near
  its head, making an excellent further screen.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft noted that Jack was observing his raiment. "I
  trust, Mr. De Peyster, you will pardon the liberty I have taken
  with your clothes. My own were still wet from last night."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Jack. "But, say, Matilda, have your
  sister eat her breakfast. What we've come to talk about can
  wait."</p>

  <p>But Matilda's sister, after all, wished no breakfast. And
  solicitation could not rouse in her an appetite.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Jack. "Then to the point. I thought we'd
  better all get together on the matter at once. It's about
  food."</p>

  <p>"Food?" queried Mr. Pyecroft, a bit blankly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and it's some problem, you bet. Here's a house that is
  supposed to be empty. And within this empty house are five
  adults. Do you get me?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it terrible!" cried Mary.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span>

  <p>"Five adults," repeated Jack. "How are we going to get food in
  here for them without exciting suspicion?"</p>

  <p>"As you say," mused Mr. Pyecroft with a wry face, "that is
  certainly some problem. My own appetite is already one
  magnitudinous toothache."</p>

  <p>Jack enlarged upon their situation.</p>

  <p>"Since Judge Harvey tipped me off to the fact that the
  newspapers smelled a story, and since that reporter Mayfair and
  other reporters began to watch this house, I've had to give up
  going out. We two would have starved but for what Judge Harvey
  and William managed to slip in to us. Even with that, we've
  almost starved. In fact, we've been driven by hunger about to the
  point of giving in, going out, acknowledging our marriage and
  taking the consequences."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster, face buried in the shadow, thrilled with a
  sudden rush of hope. If Jack and Mary should leave the house,
  then half her danger would be ended!</p>

  <p>"But, you see, since that news yesterday about mother being so
  sick in Europe," Jack continued solicitously, "I feel that, in
  her weakened condition, the news of our marriage might be a very
  severe shock for her. So for her sake we're going to keep the
  thing secret for a while yet, and stick it out here."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster could hardly keep back a groan.</p>

  <p>"So, now," Jack again propounded, "what the dickens are the
  five of us going to do?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page181" id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft rubbed his wide mouth for a meditative moment.
  Then he smiled upon Matilda.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me, sister dear, that we'll have to put it up to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Up to me?" cried Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Matilda. You belong here; you can come and go as a
  matter of course. You have a sister visiting you; also a brother,
  but as I have requested, the less said about his being here the
  better. But you can go out and openly order provisions for
  yourself and our sister. And you can give a good large order for
  nourishing canned goods, casually mentioning that you are laying
  in a supply so that you will not have to bother again soon with
  staples. That, with what Judge Harvey and William can smuggle in,
  should keep us provided for."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft's suggestion was approved by the majority. As an
  addendum to his proposal Matilda was ordered to answer the bell
  whenever rung; if she did not, with the knowledge abroad that she
  was in the house, a dangerous suspicion might be aroused. But she
  should be careful when she went to the door, very careful.</p>

  <p>Matilda was driven forth to make the purchases; Mr. Pyecroft,
  under Jack's guidance, went below to forage for the
  an&amp;#230;sthetic of immediate crumbs; and Mary,
  tender-heartedly, remained behind to relieve the tedium of and
  give comfort to the invalid. She straightened up the room a bit;
  urged the patient <span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id=
  "page182"></a>[pg 182]</span> to eat, to no avail; then went out
  of the room for a minute, and reappeared with a book.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to read to you, Angelica," she announced, in a loud
  yet nursey voice. "I suppose your taste in books is about the
  same as your sister's. Here's a story I found in Matilda's room.
  It's called 'Wormwood.' I'm sure you'll like it."</p>

  <p>So placed that she could get all of the dim light that slanted
  through the tiny shuttered window, Mary began, her voice raised
  to meet the need of Mrs. De Peyster's aural handicap. Now Marie
  Corelli may have been the favorite novelist of a certain amiable
  queen, who somehow managed to continue to the age of eighty-two
  despite her preference. But Mrs. De Peyster liked no fiction; and
  the noble platitudes, the resounding moralizings, the prodigious
  melodrama, the vast caverns of words of the queen's favorite made
  Mrs. De Peyster writhe upon her second maid's undentable bed. If
  only she actually did possess the divine gift of defective
  hearing with which Mr. Pyecroft had afflicted her! But in the
  same loud voice, trying to conceal her own boredom, Mary read on,
  on, on&mdash;patiently on.</p>

  <p>At length Matilda returned. Mary closed the book with a sigh
  of relief, which on the instant she repressed.</p>

  <p>"I'll read to you for a while two or three times a day," she
  promised. "I know what a comfort it is to a sick person to hear a
  story she likes."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster did not even thank her.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <h3>DOMESTIC SCENES</h3>

  <p>The provisions arrived; Mr. Pyecroft proved himself agreeably
  competent and willing in the matter of their preparation; and
  such as had appetites gorged themselves. Also Mr. Pyecroft proved
  himself agreeably competent and willing to do his full share, and
  more, in the matter of cleaning up.</p>

  <p>Later in the forenoon, Mary again called on Mrs. De Peyster.
  "I hope you don't mind a little praise directed at your family,
  Angelica," she said, in the loud voice she had adopted for that
  unfortunate. "At first Jack and I thought your brother Archibald
  was&mdash;well&mdash;too pompous. You know, clergymen are often
  that way. But the more we see of him, the better we like him.
  He's so pleasant, so helpful. I hope the little trouble he spoke
  of being in with the police isn't serious, for Jack and I think
  he's simply splendid!"</p>

  <p>Archibald's sister seemed indifferent to this praise of her
  brother. At least she said nothing. So Mary took up "Wormwood"
  and half-shouted another installment.</p>

  <p>The spirits of Jack and Mary, which during the previous
  evening and the earlier part of this morning had been subdued by
  concern over the illness of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page184" id="page184"></a>[pg 184]</span> distant Mrs. De
  Peyster, had, an hour before Mary's second visit, become suddenly
  hilarious. While Mary read, Mrs. De Peyster wondered over this
  change. When the book was closed upon the installment, she
  hesitatingly asked concerning this mystery.</p>

  <p>"It's news about Mrs. De Peyster," answered Mary. "But of
  course it could hardly interest you much, for you've never met
  her&mdash;at least I supposed not, Angelica."</p>

  <p>"I've&mdash;seen her," corrected Angelica. "What&mdash;what
  news?"</p>

  <p>"Why," cried Mary in her soft, happy contralto, "Judge Harvey
  just telephoned that the latest papers contain cables saying that
  Mrs. De Peyster has just left Paris on that long motor trip of
  hers to the Balkans. That means that Jack's mother must be quite
  well again. We all feel so relieved&mdash;so very, very
  relieved!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster also felt relief&mdash;and some badly needed
  courage flowed into her. Olivetta's part of the plan, at least,
  was working out as per schedule.</p>

  <p>Finally Mary went, Matilda brought in her lunch, and the
  afternoon began to wear itself away, Mrs. De Peyster keeping most
  of the time to the hard, narrow bed of the second maid. Twice,
  however, she got up while Matilda guarded her door, stood at her
  high, cell-like window, and peered through the slats of the
  closed shutter, past the purple-and-lavender plumes of the
  wistaria that climbed on up to the roof, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span> and
  out upon the soft, green, sunny spaces of Washington Square. The
  Square, which she had been proud to live upon but rarely walked
  in,&mdash;only children and nursemaids and the commoner people
  actually walked in it,&mdash;the Square looked so expansive, so
  free, so inviting. And this tiny cell&mdash;these days of early
  May were unseasonably, hot&mdash;seemed to grow more narrow and
  more stifling every moment. How had any one ever, ever
  voluntarily endured it!</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster learned that Jack was studying at home, and
  studying hard. With the return of Matilda to the house, Jack
  repeated his instruction concerning the piano: Matilda was to
  tell any inquisitive folk that Mrs. De Peyster had bought a
  player-piano shortly before she sailed, and that she, Matilda,
  was operating it to while away the tedious hours. This device
  made it possible for Mary to begin her neglected practice.</p>

  <p>With the certainty of being bored, yet with an irrepressible
  curiosity, Mrs. De Peyster, piano-lover, awaited during the
  morning and early forenoon Mary's first assault upon the
  instrument. She would be crude, no doubt of it; no technique, no
  poetic suavity of touch, no sense of interpretation.</p>

  <p>When from the rear drawing-room the grand piano sent upwards
  to Mrs. De Peyster its first strains, they were rapid, careless
  scales and runs. Quite as she'd expected. Then the player began
  Chopin's Ballade <span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id=
  "page186"></a>[pg 186]</span> in G Minor. Mrs. De Peyster
  listened contemptuously; then with rebellious interest; then with
  complete absorption. That person below could certainly play the
  piano&mdash;brilliantly, feelingly, with the touch and insight of
  an artist. Mrs. De Peyster's soul rose and fell with the soul of
  the song, and when the piano, after its uprushing, almost human
  closing cry, fell sharply into silence, she was for the moment
  that piano's vassal.</p>

  <p>Then she remembered who was the player. Instinctively her
  emotions chilled; and she lay stiffly in bed, hostile, on guard,
  defying the charm of the further music.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the piano broke off in the very middle of Liszt's
  Rhapsodic Number Twelve. The way the music snapped off startled
  her. There was something inexplicably ominous about it.
  Intuitively she felt that something was happening below. She
  wondered what it could be.</p>

  <p>An hour passed; she continued wondering; then Matilda entered
  the attic room, behind her Mr. Pyecroft and Mary.</p>

  <p>"Sister"&mdash;such familiarity was difficult to Matilda, even
  though she knew this familiarity was necessary to maintain the
  roles circumstances and Mr. Pyecroft had forced upon
  them&mdash;"sister," she quavered, "I thought you might be
  interested to know that the bell rang awhile ago, and I went
  down, and there was a man&mdash;with a note to me from&mdash;from
  Mrs. De Peyster."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id=
  "page187"></a>[pg 187]</span>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed Mrs. De Peyster, in an almost natural
  tone.</p>

  <p>"It&mdash;it's disturbed us all so much that I thought you
  might like to look at it. Here it is."</p>

  <p>Shakingly, Matilda held out a sheet of paper. Shakingly, but
  without turning to face her visitors, Mrs. De Peyster took it.
  There was enough light to see that the letter was written on
  heavy paper embossed at the top with a flag and "S.S. Plutonia,"
  and was dated the evening she had supposedly gone on board. The
  note read:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>DEAR MATILDA:&mdash;</p>
      <p>Just at this late moment I recall something which,
      in the hurry of getting off, I forgot to tell you
      about.
      This is that I left instructions with Mr. Howard, an
      expert cabinet-maker, who has previously done
      things for me under the supervision of the Tiffany
      Studios, to go over all my furniture while I am abroad
      and touch up and repair such pieces as may be out
      of order. I am sending this letter to Mr. Howard
      for him or his representative to present for
      identification
      to you when he is ready to undertake the
      work. See that he has every facility.</p>
  </blockquote>


  <p>Mrs. De Peyster lay dizzily still. Such an order she had never
  given. But the writing was amazingly similar to her own.</p>

  <p>"Well, Matilda?" she managed to inquire, in a voice she tried
  to make like the sickly Angelica's.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span>

  <p>"When the man showed me the note, I tried to put him off; but
  he simply wouldn't go and he followed me in. His orders, he said.
  I showed the letter to Mary and Mr. Pyecroft. The man saw them.
  They said call up Judge Harvey and ask him what to do. I did and
  Judge Harvey came down and he examined the letter and said it was
  undoubtedly written by Mrs. De Peyster. And he called up the
  Tiffany Studios, and they said they'd had such a telephone order
  from Mrs. De Peyster."</p>

  <p>"Jack and I never dreamed that his mother might have left
  orders to have people in here to renovate the house!" cried Mary
  in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then Judge Harvey asked the man to put off the
  work," Matilda went on. "The man was very polite, but he said his
  orders from Mrs. De Peyster had been strict, and if he wasn't
  allowed to go on with the work, he said, in order to protect
  himself, he'd have to cable Mrs. De Peyster that the people
  occupying her house wouldn't let him. Judge Harvey didn't want
  Mrs. De Peyster to find out about Mr. and Mrs. Jack, so he told
  the man to go ahead."</p>

  <p>"And the man?" breathed Mrs. De Peyster. "Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"He's down in the drawing-room, beginning on the tables."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," suggested Mr. Pyecroft, "that since this
  summer hotel is filling so rapidly, we might as well withdraw our
  advertisements from the papers."</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span>

  <p>"I wonder, ma'&mdash;" Matilda checked herself just in time.
  "I wonder, Angelica," she exclaimed desperately, "who it'll be
  next?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it simply awful!" cried Mary. "But Jack's gone into
  hiding and isn't going to stir&mdash;and the man didn't see
  him&mdash;and I'm your niece, you know. So Jack and I are in no
  danger. Anyhow, Judge Harvey gave the man a&mdash;a large fee not
  to mention any one being in the house besides Matilda, and the
  man promised. So I guess all of us are safe."</p>

  <p>But no such sentiment of security comforted Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>Who was the man?</p>

  <p>What was he here for?</p>

  <p>One thing was certain: he and those behind him had made clever
  and adequate preparations for his admission. And she dared not
  expose him, and order him out&mdash;for only that very morning
  she had left Paris on her motor trip! She could only lie on the
  second maid's narrow bed and await developments.</p>

  <p>Matilda went out to attend to her domestic duties below; Mr.
  Pyecroft withdrew; and Mary, the sympathetic Mary,&mdash;Mary who
  had no worry, for the cabinet-maker below would in due time
  complete his routine work and take himself away,&mdash;Mary
  remained behind to apply to the invalid the soothing mental
  poultice of "Wormwood." But "Wormwood" did not torment Mrs. De
  Peyster as it had done in the forenoon. She did not hear it. She
  was thinking of the cabinet-maker below. But Mary <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span>
  faithfully continued; she did not cease when Mr. Pyecroft
  re&amp;#235;ntered. There was a slightly amused look in that
  gentleman's face, but he said nothing, and seated himself on the
  foot of the bed and gazed thoughtfully at the wall of scaling
  kalsomine&mdash;and Mary's loudly pitched voice went on, and on,
  and on.</p>

  <p>They were thus engaged when Matilda returned. She was all
  a-tremble. Behind her, holding her arm, was a smallish,
  sharp-faced young man.</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;he came in with the roast," Matilda stammered
  wildly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft had sprung up from the bed.</p>

  <p>"And who is <i>he</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mayfair, of the 'Record,'" answered the young man,
  loosing Matilda and stepping forward.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster shivered frantically down beneath the
  bedclothes, her see-sawing hopes once more at the bottom. Mary
  leaned limply back in the shadow and hid her face.</p>

  <p>"He tried to question me&mdash;and he made me bring
  him&mdash;" Matilda was chattering.</p>

  <p>"May I inquire what it is you wish, Mr. Mayfair?" requested
  Mr. Pyecroft&mdash;and Matilda fled.</p>

  <p>"You may," rapidly said the undeceivable Mr. Mayfair. Mr.
  Mayfair had learned and made his own one of the main tricks of
  that method of police inquisition known as the "third degree": to
  hurl a fact, or a suspicion with all the air of its being the
  truth, with bomb-like suddenness into the face of <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span> the
  unprepared suspect. "I know Jack De Peyster has made a runaway
  marriage! I know he and his wife are living secretly in this
  house!"</p>

  <p>"Why, this news is simply astounding!" exclaimed Mr.
  Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>"Come, now. Bluffing won't work with me. You see, I'm on to it
  all!"</p>

  <p>"I presume it's a newspaper story you're after?" Mr. Pyecroft
  inquired politely.</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p>

  <p>"Then"&mdash;in the same polite tone&mdash;"if you know it
  all, why don't you print it?"</p>

  <p>"I want the heart-story of the runaway lovers," declared Mr.
  Mayfair.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, Mr. Mayfair," Mr. Pyecroft suggested gently,
  "that you are the one who is only bluffing. You have a suspicion,
  and are trying to find evidence to support it."</p>

  <p>"I know, I tell you!"</p>

  <p>"Then may I inquire to whom young Mr. De Peyster is
  married?"</p>

  <p>"I know all right!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, then, you don't really know," said Mr. Pyecroft
  mildly.</p>

  <p>"I know, I tell you!" Mr. Mayfair repeated in his sharp,
  third-degree manner.</p>

  <p>"Then why trouble us? Why not, as I have already suggested,
  print it?"</p>

  <p>"I'm here to see them!" Mr. Mayfair said peremptorily. Then
  his tone became soft, diplomatic. "The <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg 192]</span>
  housekeeper spoke about referring me to her brother. You are her
  brother, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mayfair smiled persuasively. "If you would tell me what
  you know about them, and lead me to where they are, my paper
  would be quite willing to be liberal. Say twenty dollars."</p>

  <p>"I'd accept it gladly," said Mr. Pyecroft, "but I know nothing
  of the matter."</p>

  <p>"One hundred," bid Mr. Mayfair.</p>

  <p>"I would have done it for twenty, if I could. But I couldn't
  do it for a thousand. They are not here."</p>

  <p>"I know better!" snapped Mr. Mayfair, his manner sharp again.
  "Who's that?" he demanded suspiciously, pointing at Mary's
  shadow-veiled figure.</p>

  <p>"That? That is my niece. The daughter of my sister Angelica
  here."</p>

  <p>"Is she your mother?" demanded Mr. Mayfair of Mary.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," breathed Mary from her corner.</p>

  <p>"Madam, is she your daughter?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster did not reply.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, my sister is ill, and somewhat deaf," put in Mr.
  Pyecroft. "Angelica, dear," he half shouted, "the gentleman
  wishes to know if this is your daughter."</p>

  <p>"Yes," from Mrs. De Peyster in smothered voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, I know they're here," doggedly insisted Mr. Mayfair,
  "and I'm going to see them! I have witnesses who saw them
  enter."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id=
  "page193"></a>[pg 193]</span>

  <p>"Indeed!" Mr. Pyecroft looked surprised and puzzled. "The
  witnesses can swear to seeing young Mr. De Peyster come in?"</p>

  <p>"They can swear to seeing a young man and woman come in. And I
  know they were Mr. De Peyster and his wife."</p>

  <p>"That's strange." Suddenly Mr. Pyecroft's face cleared. "I
  think I begin to understand! It was at night, wasn't it, when the
  witnesses saw them come in?"</p>

  <p>"At night, yes."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry you have been caused all this trouble, Mr.
  Mayfair,"&mdash;in a tone of very genuine regret. "But there has
  been a blunder&mdash;a perfectly natural one, I now see.
  Undoubtedly the young couple your witnesses saw were my niece and
  myself."</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Mr. Mayfair. For a moment the undeflectable star
  reporter was all chagrin. Then he was all suspicion. "But why,"
  he snapped out, "should you and your niece slip in at night? And
  why should you live here in hiding?"</p>

  <p>"You force me into a disagreeable and humiliating admission.
  The fact is, our family is in severe financial straits. We simply
  had no money to live on, and no prospects in sight. To help us
  out temporarily, my sister Matilda invited us to stay here while
  Mrs. De Peyster is in Europe. But for Mrs. De Peyster to know of
  our being here might cost my sister Matilda her position, which
  accounts for our attempt to get in unseen and to live here
  secretly. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id=
  "page194"></a>[pg 194]</span> We had to protect Matilda against
  the facts leaking out."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mayfair stared searchingly at Mr. Pyecroft's face. It was
  confused, as was quite natural after the confession of a not very
  honorable, and certainly not very dignified, procedure. But it
  was candor itself.</p>

  <p>"Hell!" he burst out irefully. "Some one has certainly given
  me a bum steer. But I'll get that young couple yet, you see!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry about the story," said Mr. Pyecroft. And then with
  a slight smile, apologetic, as of one who knows he is taking
  liberties: "Perhaps, as compensation for the story you missed,
  you could write a society story about Mrs. De Peyster's
  housekeeper entertaining for the summer her brother, sister, and
  niece."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mayfair grinned, ever so little. "You've got some sense of
  humor, old top," he approved dryly.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Mr. Pyecroft, with a gratified air.</p>

  <p>He led Mr. Mayfair past the room within which Jack was hidden,
  down to the servants' door and courteously let him out. Two
  minutes later Mr. Pyecroft was again in the second maid's room.
  Mary eagerly sprang forward and caught his hand.</p>

  <p>"I waited to thank you&mdash;you were simply superb!" she
  cried enthusiastically. "I've been telling your sister how
  wonderful you are. She's got to forgive you&mdash;I'll make her!
  And Jack will die laughing <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page195" id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span> when I tell him." She
  herself burst into excited merriment that half-choked her. "Just
  think of it&mdash;all the while he was looking&mdash;looking a
  big story straight in the face!"</p>

  <p>She was off to tell Jack.</p>

  <p>"One might add, looking two big stories straight in the face,
  eh, Angelica, my dear?" chuckled Mr. Pyecroft, <i>alias</i> Mr.
  Preston.</p>

  <p>One might add, three big stories, shivered Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>But she did not add this aloud.</p><span class=

  <h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <h3>THE MAN IN THE CELLULOID COLLAR</h3>

  <p>The amused smile which Mr. Pyecroft had worn when he had
  entered, and which he had subdued to thoughtful sobriety while
  "Wormwood" was assuaging the invalid's tribulations, began now to
  reappear. It grew. Mrs. De Peyster could but notice it, for he
  was smiling straight at her&mdash;that queer, whimsical, twisted
  smile of his.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she felt forced to ask.</p>

  <p>"We three are not the only ones, my dear Angelica," he
  replied, "who are trying to slip one across on Mrs. De Peyster.
  Our friend the cabinet-maker is on the same job. I might remark,
  that he's about as much a cabinet-maker as yourself."</p>

  <p>"What is he?"</p>

  <p>"A detective, my dear."</p>

  <p>"A detective!"</p>

  <p>"The variety known as 'private,'" enlarged Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what makes you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I felt it my duty to keep an eye on our new
  guest&mdash;unobtrusively, of course. When I slipped out a little
  while ago it was to watch him. He was working in the library;
  entirely by accident, my dear Angelica, my eye chanced to be at
  the keyhole. He <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id=
  "page197"></a>[pg 197]</span> was examining the drawers of the
  big writing-table; and not paying so much attention to the
  drawers as to the letters in them. And from the rapidity with
  which he was examining the letters it was plain the cabinet-maker
  knew exactly what he was after."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;do you think&mdash;it means?" breathed Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Some person is trying to get something on Mrs. De Peyster,"
  returned Mr. Pyecroft. "What, I don't know. But the detective
  party, I've got sized up. He's one of those gracious and
  indispensable noblest-works-of-God who dig up evidence for
  divorce trials&mdash;lay traps for the so-called
  'guilty-parties,' ransack waste-paper baskets for incriminating
  scraps of letters, bribe servants&mdash;and if they find
  anything, willing to blackmail either side; remarkably impartial
  and above prejudice in this respect, one must admit. Altogether a
  most delectable breed of gentlemen. What would our best society
  do without them? And then again, what would they do without our
  best society?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster did not attempt an answer to this conjectural
  dilemma.</p>

  <p>"Twin and interdependent pillars of America's shining
  morality," continued Mr. Pyecroft. "Now, like you, Angelica," he
  mused, "I wonder what the detective party is after; what the
  lofty Lady De Peyster can have been doing that is spicy?
  However," smiling at her, "Angelica, my dear, in the words of the
  great and good poet, 'We should worry.'"</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span>

  <p>It was only a moment later that Matilda burst into the room
  and closed the door behind her. She was almost breathless.</p>

  <p>"He asked me for the key to"&mdash;"your" almost escaped
  Matilda&mdash;"to Mrs. De Peyster's suite. He'd been particularly
  ordered to touch up Mrs. De Peyster's private desk, he said."</p>

  <p>"And you gave him the key?" inquired Mr. Pyecroft, asking the
  very question that was struggling at Mrs. De Peyster's lips.</p>

  <p>"I told him I didn't have a key," said Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" breathed Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"But," continued Matilda, "he said it didn't matter, for he
  said he'd been brought up a locksmith. And he picked the lock
  right before my eyes."</p>

  <p>"That's one accomplishment of gentlemanliness I was never
  properly instructed in," said Mr. Pyecroft regretfully, almost
  plaintively. "I never could pick a lock."</p>

  <p>"And where&mdash;is he now?" inquired Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"In Mrs. De Peyster's sitting-room, retouching her desk."</p>

  <p>"He's certainly after something, and after it hot&mdash;and
  probably something big," mused Mr. Pyecroft. "Any idea what it
  can be, Matilda?"</p>

  <p>Matilda had none.</p>

  <p>"Any idea, Angelica?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster was beginning to have an idea, and a terrified
  idea; but she likewise said she had none.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg 199]</span>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster wished Mr. Pyecroft would go, so she could
  give way to her feelings, talk with Matilda. But Mr. Pyecroft
  stretched out his legs, settled back, clasped his hands behind
  his head, and looked thoughtfully at the ceiling. He had an
  intellectual interest in some imaginary escapade of the
  far-distant Mrs. De Peyster; but no more; and he was obviously
  comfortable where he was.</p>

  <p>Matilda started out, but was recalled by a glance of
  imperative appeal from Mrs. De Peyster. And so the three sat on
  in silence for a time, Mrs. De Peyster and Matilda taut with
  expectant fear, Mr. Pyecroft loungingly unconcerned.</p>

  <p>And thus they were still sitting when there was a knock, which
  Mr. Pyecroft answered. The cabinet-maker entered. He wore a
  slouching, ready-made suit and a celluloid collar with ready-made
  bow tie snapped by an elastic over his collar-button&mdash;the
  conventional garb of the artisan who aspires for the air of
  gentlemanliness while at work. His face, though fresh-shaven, was
  dark with the sub-cutaneous stubble of a heavy beard; his eyes
  were furtive, with that masked gleam of Olympian all-confidence
  which a detective can never entirely mask.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Miss Simpson?" he said to Matilda. "Your niece
  told me I'd find you here, so I came right up. Could I have a
  word with you outside?"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you have it here just as well," suggested Mr.
  Pyecroft&mdash;who somehow had <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page200" id="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span> imperceptibly taken on
  an air of mediocrity. "We're all in the family, you know."</p>

  <p>"Mebbe it'd be better to have it here," agreed the
  cabinet-maker. "You other two are living in the house, so I
  understand, because you're hard up; so your needing money may
  help what I'm after." He suddenly and visibly expanded with
  importance. "When the time comes to put my cards on the table, I
  don't waste a minute in showing my hand. That cabinet-maker
  business was all con. I'm an officer of the law."</p>

  <p>"You don't say!" cried Mr. Pyecroft with a startled air.</p>

  <p>"A detective. Brown's my name. I'm here hunting for something.
  I got part of what I wanted, but not all. What I want isn't here,
  or I'd have found it; there's only three or four places it'd have
  been locked up. I know," he ended, with driving confidence, "that
  a letter was written to Mrs. De Peyster by the Duke de
  Cr&amp;#233;cy saying he couldn't marry her. That letter is what
  I'm after."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" breathed Mr. Pyecroft. And then with his wide-eyed
  mediocrity, "I wonder whom you represent."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Allistair!" exclaimed Matilda.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster long since had been silently exclaiming the
  same.</p>

  <p>"Why, what could Mrs. Allistair want it for?" queried the
  futile-looking brother.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page201" id="page201"></a>[pg 201]</span>

  <p>"Never mind who I represent, or the reasons of the party,"
  said Mr. Brown. "That letter is what I'm after, and I'm willing
  to pay for it. That's what ought to concern you folks."</p>

  <p>"But if there ever was such a letter," commented Mr. Pyecroft
  with his simple-minded manner, "perhaps Mrs. de Peyster destroyed
  it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she did. But I found two others he wrote her. And if
  she didn't tear it up or burn it, I'm going to have it!"</p>

  <p>He directed himself at Matilda, and spoke slowly,
  suggestively, impressively. "Confidential servants, who think a
  bit of number one, should be on the lookout for documents and
  letters that may be of future value to themselves. I guess you
  get me. For the original of the letter I'm willing to come across
  with five hundred dollars."</p>

  <p>"But I have no such letter!" cried Matilda.</p>

  <p>"I might make it a thousand," conceded the detective. "And,"
  he added, "the money might come in very handy for your sick
  sister there."</p>

  <p>"But I tell you I have no such letter!"</p>

  <p>"Say fifteen hundred, then."</p>

  <p>"But I haven't got it!" cried Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you may have it without knowing what it is. Some of
  his letters he signed only with an initial. Here is a sample of
  the Duke's handwriting&mdash;one of his letters I found."</p>

  <p>"I tell you I have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Brown," interrupted the <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span>
  ineffectual-looking Mr. Pyecroft. "May I see the handwriting,
  please?"</p>

  <p>Firmly holding it in his own hands, the detective displayed
  the letter to Mr. Pyecroft&mdash;an odd, foreign hand, the paper
  of superfine quality, but without crest or any other embossing.
  Mr. Pyecroft studied it closely; his look grew puzzled; then he
  turned to Matilda.</p>

  <p>"I don't exactly remember, Matilda, but it seems to me that
  there was handwriting like this among the letters you sent to me
  to keep for you."</p>

  <p>Matilda gaped at Mr. Pyecroft. Mrs. De Peyster, half-rising on
  an elbow, peered in amazed stupefaction at her incalculable young
  man of the sea.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, she'd have turned it over to some one else
  for safe-keeping!" the detective cried triumphantly. "Where is
  it?" he demanded of Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure I have it," said the shallow Mr. Pyecroft
  apologetically. "It just seems to me that I saw writing like
  this. If I have, it's over in a little room I keep. But if I
  really do have it"&mdash;with the shrewd look of a small
  mind&mdash;"we couldn't sell it for fifteen hundred."</p>

  <p>"How much d'you want?"</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;Mr. Pyecroft hesitated&mdash;"say&mdash;say three
  thousand."</p>

  <p>"Good God, that's plain blackmail!"</p>

  <p>"It may be, but poor people like us don't often get a chance
  like this."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id=
  "page203"></a>[pg 203]</span>

  <p>"I won't pay it!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, then,"&mdash;apologetically,&mdash;"we'd better deal
  with Mrs. Allistair direct."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well,&mdash;if you've got the letter, we won't scrap
  about the price. I'll come across."</p>

  <p>"Cash?" shrewdly queried the doltish brother.</p>

  <p>"Sure. I don't run no risks with checks."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;we&mdash;wouldn't let the letter go out of our hands
  until it's paid for. And we won't go to any office. You yourself
  can say whether it's what you want or not? And you can pay right
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I'm the judge of what I want. And when I go for a big
  thing, I go prepared." Mr. Brown opened his coat, and
  significantly patted a bulge on the right side of his vest.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I'll go to my room and see if I have it. But
  you'll have to wait here, for"&mdash;again with the shrewd look
  of the ineffectual man&mdash;"you might follow me, and with some
  more detectives you might take the letter from me."</p>

  <p>"Soon wait here as anywhere else. Anyhow, I'll want your
  sister's word," nodding at Matilda, "that the letter is the same.
  But don't worry&mdash;nobody's going to take anything from
  you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft started out, then paused.</p>

  <p>"I just happened to remember; you said the letter might not be
  signed. Hadn't you better let me have one of the Duke de
  Cr&amp;#233;cy's letters, so I can verify the
  handwriting?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id=
  "page204"></a>[pg 204]</span>

  <p>"I don't mind; these don't tell much." And the detective
  handed over one letter.</p>

  <p>"It may be an hour or two before I can get back; the letters
  are packed away and I've got to go through them and compare
  them."</p>

  <p>He slipped out. Mr. Brown, as he watched him, could hardly
  conceal his contempt.</p>

  <p>The detective sat heavily down. Mrs. De Peyster was sick with
  apprehension as to what that incomprehensible Mr. Pyecroft was
  about to do. She wanted to talk to Matilda. But the two dared not
  speak with this confident, omniscient, detectorial presence
  between them. Mr. Brown condescendingly tried to make
  conversation by complimenting Matilda on her shrewdness; he'd
  helped a lot of clever servants like her to snug little
  fortunes.</p>

  <p>But Matilda proved a poor conversationalist.</p>

  <p>Close upon two hours passed before Mr. Pyecroft returned. He
  drew a letter from his pocket, firmly gripped its edges with both
  hands, and held it out to Mr. Brown.</p>

  <p>"Is this the one?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't I tell you not to be afraid; no one's going to steal
  it from you."</p>

  <p>He took the letter from Mr. Pyecroft's unwilling and
  untrustful hands and glanced it through. The next moment it was
  as though an arc light of excitement had been switched on within
  his ample person. With swift, expert fingers he compared the
  texture of the paper of the new letter and the earlier
  ones.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id=
  "page205"></a>[pg 205]</span>

  <p>"Great God!" he exulted. "Same paper&mdash;same
  handwriting&mdash;and it says just what I expected&mdash;and
  signed 'De Cr&amp;#233;cy'!"</p>

  <p>He held out the letter to Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you identify this as the letter you found?"</p>

  <p>But Matilda shrank away as though the letter was deadly
  poison.</p>

  <p>"I never saw the thing before!"</p>

  <p>"What's that?" cried the detective.</p>

  <p>"She's trying to hold out for more money," explained Mr.
  Pyecroft. From behind the detective's broad back he gave Matilda
  a warning look; then said softly: "Of course, it's the letter,
  isn't it, sister?"</p>

  <p>Matilda thought only of saving the hour. The day would have to
  save itself.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said.</p>

  <p>"Might&mdash;might I see it?" huskily inquired Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Sure. The more that corroborates it the better."</p>

  <p>Her face to the wall, the faint light slanting across her
  shoulder, she glanced at the letter. The Duke's own handwriting!
  And a jilting letter!&mdash;politely worded&mdash;but a jilting
  letter!... Mrs. De Peyster jilted!... If that were ever to come
  out&mdash;</p>

  <p>For a moment she lay enfeebled and overwhelmed with horror.
  Then convulsively she crushed the letter in her hands.</p>

  <p>"See here&mdash;wha' d' you mean?" cried the <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span>
  startled detective, springing forward; in a moment his powerful
  hands rescued the document.</p>

  <p>"Both of my sisters think we ought to stand out for more
  money," apologized Mr. Pyecroft. "And I'm not so sure they're not
  right."</p>

  <p>"We've made our bargain already," quickly returned Mr. Brown.
  "And that's just how we'll settle."</p>

  <p>He started to slip the letter into a pocket. But Mr. Pyecroft
  caught hold of it.</p>

  <p>"How about the money?"</p>

  <p>"You mean you don't trust me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not saying that," apologized Mr. Pyecroft. "But this
  means a lot to us. We can't afford to run any risks."</p>

  <p>"All right, then."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brown released the letter, drew a leather wallet from
  inside his vest, counted off six five-hundred-dollar bills,
  returned the wallet and held out the bills. The exchange was
  made. The detective carefully put the letter into a thick manila
  envelope, which he licked and sealed and put inside his vest to
  keep company with the wallet.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft counted the bills, slowly, three or four times;
  then looked up.</p>

  <p>"I bet my sisters were right; you would have paid more," he
  said regretfully, greedily.</p>

  <p>"Never you mind what I would have paid!" retorted the
  detective, buttoning his coat over the letter.</p><span class=

  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg

  <p>"You'd have paid twice that!" Mr. Pyecroft exclaimed
  disappointedly.</p>

  <p>The detective, triumphant, could not resist grinning
  confirmingly.</p>

  <p>"We've been outwitted!" cried Mr. Pyecroft. He turned to the
  two woman contritely. "If I'd only heeded you&mdash;let you have
  managed the affair!"</p>

  <p>"You people got a mighty good price," commented Detective
  Brown.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;perhaps so," sighed Mr. Pyecroft. Chagrin gave way
  to curiosity in his face. "I wonder, now, how Mrs. Allistair is
  going to use the letter?"</p>

  <p>"That's none of my business."</p>

  <p>"She must think she can do a lot with it," mused Mr. Pyecroft.
  "If the letter, or its substance, were printed, say in 'Town
  Gossip,' I suppose it would mean the end of Mrs. De Peyster's
  social leadership, and Mrs. Allistair would then have things her
  own way."</p>

  <p>"Can't say," said the detective. But he winked knowingly.</p>

  <p>When he had gone Mr. Pyecroft stood listening until the
  descending tread had thinned into silence. Then he turned about
  to Mrs. De Peyster and Matilda, and his wide mouth twisted up and
  rightward into that pagan, delighted smile of his. He laughed
  without noise; but every cell of him was laughing.</p>

  <p>"Well, sisters dear, we're cleaning up&mdash;eh! I
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg
  208]</span> had the devil's own time matching that letter-paper
  at Brentanos', and I ran a pretty big risk leaving the
  house&mdash;but, say, it was worth it!" For a moment he could
  only laugh. "First, let's split the pile. I told you I was always
  square with my pals. Here's a thousand for you,
  Angelica,"&mdash;slipping two bills under Mrs. De Peyster's
  pillow,&mdash;"and a thousand for you, Matilda,"&mdash;thrusting
  the amount into her hands,&mdash;"and a thousand for your dear
  brother Archibald,"&mdash;slipping his share into a vest
  pocket.</p>

  <p>Neither of the two women dared refuse the money.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but," Mrs. De Peyster gasped thickly, "it's an
  outrageous forgery!"</p>

  <p>"A forgery, I grant you, my dear Angelica," Mr. Pyecroft said
  good-humoredly. "But if by outrageous you mean crude or obvious,
  I beg to correct you. Even if I must say it myself, that forgery
  was strictly first-class."</p>

  <p>"But it's a forgery!" repeated Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"My dears, don't you worry about that," he reassured them
  soothingly. "There'll be no comeback. That detective and his
  agency, and Mrs. Allistair behind them, first tried robbery, then
  tried bribery. They're all in bad themselves. So stop worrying;
  you're in no danger at all from arrest for forgery or fraud.
  There'll never be a peep from any of them."</p>

  <p>This seemed sound reasoning, but Mrs. De Peyster did not
  acknowledge herself comforted.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page209" id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>

  <p>"Besides," Mr. Pyecroft went on, with a sudden flash of
  wrathful contempt, "if there's anybody under God's sun I like to
  slip something over on it's those damned vermin of private
  detectives! And the swells that employ them! I hope that Mrs.
  Allistair gets stung good and plenty!"</p>

  <p>"But Mrs. De Peyster!" wailed that lady&mdash;she couldn't
  help it, though she tried to keep inarticulate her sense of
  complete annihilation. "When they publish that letter the damage
  will have been done. It's a forgery, but nobody will believe her
  when she says so, and she can't prove it! She'll be ruined!"</p>

  <p>"Well," Mr. Pyecroft commented casually, "I don't see where
  that bothers us. She's pretty much of a stiff, too, and I
  wouldn't mind handing her one while we're at it. But, Lord, this
  won't hurt her a bit."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster sat suddenly upright.</p>

  <p>"Not hurt her?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't I tell you?" chortled Mr. Pyecroft. "Why, when our
  excellent friend, Mr. Brown, presents the Duke's letter to-morrow
  morning to his chief, or to Mrs. Allistair's agent,&mdash;if he
  ever gets that far,&mdash;he will turn triumphantly over one
  sheet of Brentanos' very best notepaper&mdash;blank."</p>

  <p>"Blank?" cried Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft's right eyelid drooped in its remarkable wink;
  his mouth again tilted high to starboard in its impish
  smile.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id=
  "page210"></a>[pg 210]</span>

  <p>"You see," he remarked, "the Duke's letter was written in an
  ink of my own invention. One trifling idiosyncracy of that ink is
  that it fades completely and permanently in exactly twelve
  hours."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id=

  <h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <h3>A QUESTION OF IDENTITY</h3>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft's grin grew by degrees more delighted: became the
  smile of a whimsical genius of devil-may-care, of an exultantly
  mischievous Pan. But he offered not a word of comment upon his
  work. He was an artist who was, in the main, content to achieve
  his masterpieces and leave comment and blame and praise to his
  public and his critics.</p>

  <p>He stood up.</p>

  <p>"I believe I promised to peel the potatoes and put on the
  roast," he remarked, and went out.</p>

  <p>"Matilda," breathed Mrs. De Peyster, numbed and awed, still
  aghast, "did you ever dream there could be such a man?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ma'am,&mdash;never!"&mdash;tragically, wildly.</p>

  <p>"Whatever <i>is</i> he going to do next?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know, ma'am. Almost anything."</p>

  <p>"And whatever is going to happen to us next?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ma'am, it's terrible to think about! I'm sure I can't
  even guess! Mr. Pyecroft, and all the others, and all these
  things happening&mdash;I'm sure they'll be the death of me,
  ma'am!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster sprang from her bed. Despite <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg 212]</span>
  Matilda's cheap dressing-gown which she wore as appropriate to
  her station, she made a splendid figure of raging majesty, hands
  clenched, eyes blazing, furiously erect.</p>

  <p>"That man is outrageous!" she stormed. "I cannot, and shall
  not, stand him any longer! We must, and shall, get rid of him!"
  Her voice rang with its accustomed tone of all-conquering
  determination. "Matilda, we are going to do it! I say we are
  going to do it!"</p>

  <p>Matilda gazed admiringly at her magnificently aroused
  mistress. "Of course, you'll do it, ma'am," she said with
  conviction.</p>

  <p>"I cannot endure him another minute!" Mrs. De Peyster raged
  on. "At once, he goes out of this house! Or we do!"</p>

  <p>"Of course, ma'am," repeated Matilda in her adoring voice. And
  then after a moment, she added quaveringly: "But please,
  ma'am,&mdash;how are we going to do it?"</p>

  <p>The outraged and annihilatory Mrs. De Peyster gazed at
  Matilda, utterer of practical common-places. As she gazed the
  splendid flames within her seemed slowly to flicker out, and she
  sank back upon her bed. Yes, how were they going to do it?</p>

  <p>In cooler mood they discussed that question, without
  discovering a solution; discussed it until it was time for
  Matilda to go downstairs to perform her share of the preparation
  of the communal dinner. Left alone, her fury now sunk to sober
  ashes, Mrs. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id=
  "page213"></a>[pg 213]</span> De Peyster continued the
  exploration of possibilities, with the same negative result.</p>

  <p>Matilda brought up her dinner on a tray, then returned to the
  kitchen; for though the others were all doing fair tasks, to
  Matilda of twenty years' experience fell the oversight of the
  thousand details of the house. Presently Mary appeared, on one of
  her visits of mercy&mdash;full of relief that the cabinet-maker
  had ended his work so soon, thus setting Jack free.</p>

  <p>But before beginning the anodynous "Wormwood," she launched
  into another high-voltage eulogy of Angelica's brother. Even more
  than they had at first thought was he willing and competent and
  agreeable in the matter of their common household labor; he was
  not intrusive; he was rich with clever and well-informed talk
  when they all laid aside work to be sociable. In fact, as she had
  said before, he was simply splendid!</p>

  <p>"Now, I do hope, Angelica, that you are going to forgive your
  brother," Mary insisted. "He really means well. I think he's what
  he is because he has never had a fair chance." And then more
  boldly: "I think the fault is largely yours and Matilda's.
  Matilda says your parents died when you were all young; and he
  admitted that he does not even remember them. And he also
  admitted, when I pressed him, that you and Matilda had not given
  him very much attention during his boyhood. You and Matilda are
  older; you should have brought him up more carefully; you are
  both seriously to blame <span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"
  id="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span> for what he is. So I hope," she
  concluded, "that both of you will forgive him and help him."</p>

  <p>Once more Mrs. De Peyster did not feel called upon to make
  response.</p>

  <p>"I have noted particularly that Matilda does not seem cordial
  and forgiving," Mary was continuing, when the prodigal brother
  himself dropped in. With her pretty, determined manner, Mary
  renewed her efforts at reconciliation in the estranged family.
  Mr. Pyecroft was penitent without being humble, and whenever a
  question was put directly to Mrs. De Peyster his was the tongue
  that answered; he was quite certain his sister Angelica would
  relent and receive him back into her respect and love once he had
  fully proved his worthiness.</p>

  <p>"I must say, Mr. Simpson, that I think you have an admirably
  forgiving nature," declared Mary. It was clear, though she was
  silent on the matter, that she considered his sisters to have
  cold, hard, New England hearts.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft withdrew; and Mary, in the high-pitched voice
  required by the invalid's misfortune, read "Wormwood" for an
  hour&mdash;until Jack came to the door and announced that Judge
  Harvey had again called on them. Alone, Mrs. De Peyster pondered
  her poignant problem, What should she do?&mdash;wishful that
  Matilda were present to talk the affair over with her. But
  Matilda was still busy in the kitchen with the odd jobs of
  night-end.</p>

  <p>Toward ten o'clock Mr. Pyecroft came in again. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span> He
  stood and gazed silently down upon her. The one electric light
  showed her an odd, dry smile on Mr. Pyecroft's face.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Mrs. De Peyster asked in fear.</p>

  <p>"Really, Angelica, you're not half so clever as I believed
  you."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she repeated huskily.</p>

  <p>"This pearl." And from a pocket he drew out the pendant he had
  appropriated the night before in Mrs. Gilbert's boarding-house.
  "I thought we ought to be prepared with more cash in hand for our
  get-away when we decide to make it. So an hour ago I slipped out
  the back way, and made for a safe pawnbroker I know of. Angelica,
  you're easy. This pearl is nothing but imitation. And you fell
  for it!" He shook his head sorrowingly, chidingly. "Here's one
  case where remorse might be highly proper&mdash;and safest;
  better just mail it back to the party you lifted it from."</p>

  <p>With good-humored contempt he tossed the pendant upon the bed.
  Mrs. De Peyster clutched it and thrust it beneath her pillow.</p>

  <p>"I believe, Angelica, my dear," he commented, "that in view of
  the capacity this pearl incident has revealed, it is strictly up
  to me to assume charge of every detail of our plan."</p>

  <p>He sat down and in his fluent manner discussed the day's
  developments and their preparations for the future; and he was
  still talking when, fifteen minutes later, the door opened and
  Matilda entered. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id=
  "page216"></a>[pg 216]</span> Her face, of late so often ashen,
  was ashen as though almost from habit.</p>

  <p>"Oh, oh," she quavered, "the servants' bell rang&mdash;and I
  answered it, like I'd been told to do&mdash;and in stepped four
  men&mdash;two of them the policemen we let in last night, and two
  men I never saw before&mdash;and they asked if they might speak
  to my brother who was visiting me. And I&mdash;I promised to call
  him down. Oh, ma'&mdash;Angelica&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pyecroft, what does this mean?" cried Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft's usual perfect composure was gone. His face was
  gleamingly alert; sharp as a razor's edge.</p>

  <p>"God knows how they've done it," he snapped out. "But it means
  they've tracked me here!"</p>

  <p>"As&mdash;as Thomas Preston?"</p>

  <p>"As Thomas Preston."</p>

  <p>"And if they take you&mdash;they&mdash;they may find me,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing more likely," grimly responded Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>"Then escape!" Mrs. De Peyster cried with frantic energy.
  "Run! For heaven's sake, run! You still have time!"</p>

  <p>"Running from the police is the surest way to get caught when
  they've got you trapped," he answered in quick, staccato tones.
  "They've got every door watched&mdash;sure. Anyhow&mdash;Listen!
  Hear those steps? They haven't trusted you, Matilda; they've
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg
  217]</span> followed. Angelica, down with your face to the wall,
  and be sick! And while you're at it, be damned sick!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster obeyed. Mr. Pyecroft drew the room's one chair
  up beside the bed, sat down, picked up "Wormwood," and again,
  with the most natural manner in the world, he began to read in a
  loud voice. The next moment the two policemen of the previous
  night came in.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft arose.</p>

  <p>"I must beg your pardon, officers," he said pleasantly and
  with a slight tincture of his clerical manner. "My sister Matilda
  just told me you wished to see me, but I was almost at the end of
  a very interesting chapter which I was reading aloud to my other
  sister, who is ill, and so I thought I would conclude the scene
  before I came down. In what way can I serve you?"</p>

  <p>Neither of the officers replied. One closed the doorway with
  his bulk, and the other thumped heavily down a flight or two of
  stairs, from whence his shout ascended:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We've got him up here, Lieutenant! Come on up!"</p>

  <p>Within the tiny room of the second maid no one spoke.
  Presently heavy footfalls mounted; the second policeman entered,
  and presently two solid men in civilian dress pushed through the
  door. The foremost, a dark-visaged man with heavy jaw, and a
  black derby which he did not remove, fixed on Mr. Pyecroft a
  triumphant, domineering gaze.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page218" id="page218"></a>[pg 218]</span>

  <p>"Well, Preston," he said, "so we've landed you at last."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft, his left forefinger still keeping the place in
  "Wormwood," stared at the speaker in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, sir, but I completely fail to understand what you
  are talking about."</p>

  <p>"Don't try that con stuff on us; we won't fall for it,"
  advised the lieutenant. He smiled with satiric satisfaction; he
  was something of a wit in the department. "But if you ain't sure
  who you are, I'll put you wise: Mr. Thomas Preston, forger of the
  Jefferson letters, it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to
  yourself. Shake hands, gents."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft continued his puzzled stare. Then a smile began
  to break through his bewilderment. Then he laughed.</p>

  <p>"So that's it, is it! You take me for that Thomas Preston.
  I've read about him. He must be a clever fellow, in his own
  way."</p>

  <p>He sobered. "But, gentlemen, if I had the clever qualities
  attributed to Mr. Preston, I am sure I could apply those
  qualities to some more useful, and even more profitable,
  occupation."</p>

  <p>"You don't do it bad at all, Preston," observed the
  lieutenant. "Only, you see, it don't go down."</p>

  <p>"I trust," Mr. Pyecroft said good-humoredly, "that it isn't
  going to be necessary to explain to you that I am not Thomas
  Preston."</p>

  <p>"No, that won't be necessary at all," replied the <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg 219]</span>
  waggish lieutenant. "Not necessary at all. For you can't."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, you really seem to be taking this matter
  seriously! Why, you two officers in uniform saw me only last
  night here with my two sisters, and any one in the neighborhood
  can tell you my sister Matilda has been housekeeper in this house
  for twenty years."</p>

  <p>That tone was most plausible. The two uniformed policemen
  looked at their superior dubiously.</p>

  <p>"Never you mind what they seen last night," the lieutenant
  commented dryly. "And never you mind about Matilda."</p>

  <p>"But you are forgetting that I am Matilda's brother," said Mr.
  Pyecroft. "Matilda, I am your brother, am I not?"</p>

  <p>"Y&mdash;yes," testified Matilda, who by the corpulent
  pressure of four crowded officers was almost being bisected
  against the edge of the stationary wash-bowl.</p>

  <p>"And you, Angelica; I'm your brother, am I not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," breathed Mrs. De Peyster from beneath the
  bedclothes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft turned in polite triumph to the lieutenant.</p>

  <p>"There, now, you see."</p>

  <p>"But, I don't see," returned that officer. "I know you're
  Thomas Preston. Jim, just slip the nippers <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span> on
  him. And there's something queer about these women. Just slip the
  bracelets on Matilda, too, and carry downstairs the party in bed.
  We'll call the police ambulance for her, and take the whole bunch
  over to the station."</p>

  <p>The party in bed suddenly stiffened as if from a stroke of
  some kind, and Matilda fairly wilted away. Mr. Pyecroft alone did
  not change by so much as a hair.</p>

  <p>"One moment, gentlemen," he interposed in his even voice,
  "before you go to regrettable extremes. I believe that an even
  better witness to my identity can easily be secured."</p>

  <p>"And who's that, Tommie?"</p>

  <p>"I refer to Judge Harvey."</p>

  <p>"Judge Harvey!" The lieutenant was startled out of his ironic
  exultation. "You mean the guy that was stung by them forged
  letters&mdash;the complainant who's making it so damned hot for
  Preston?"</p>

  <p>"The same," said Mr. Pyecroft. "Judge Harvey is at this moment
  in this house."</p>

  <p>"In this house!"</p>

  <p>"I believe he is downstairs some place going over some bills
  Mrs. De Peyster asked him to examine. Matilda, you doubtless know
  in what room the Judge is working. Will you kindly knock at his
  door and ask him to step up here for a moment?"</p>

  <p>The lieutenant frowned doubtfully at Mr. Pyecroft, hesitated,
  then nodded to Matilda. The latter, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span>
  relieved of the pressure of much policial avoirdupois, slipped
  from the room. The lieutenant turned and silently held a
  penetrating gaze upon the empty clothes-hooks. Mr. Pyecroft
  continued to look imperturbably and pleasantly upon the four
  officers. And under the bedclothes Mrs. De Peyster saw wild
  visions of Mr. Pyecroft being the next moment exposed, and
  herself dragged forth to shame.</p>

  <p>Thus for a minute or two. Then Judge Harvey appeared in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant Sullivan! See here, what's the meaning of this?"
  he demanded sternly.</p>

  <p>"'Evening, Judge Harvey," began the lieutenant, for the first
  time since his entrance removing his derby. "It's like
  this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," interrupted Mr. Pyecroft. "Judge Harvey, these
  gentlemen here have been upon the point of making a blunder that
  would be ludicrous did it not have its serious side. That's why I
  had you called. The fact is, they desire to arrest me."</p>

  <p>"Arrest you!" exclaimed the Judge.</p>

  <p>"Yes, arrest me," Mr. Pyecroft went on, easily, yet under his
  easy words trying to suggest certain definite contingencies.
  "That would be bad enough in itself. But, as you know, Judge
  Harvey, my arrest would unfortunately but necessarily involve the
  arrest of several other quite innocent persons&mdash;bring about
  a great public scandal&mdash;and create a situation that would be
  deplorable in every particular. You see that,
  Judge?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id=
  "page222"></a>[pg 222]</span>

  <p>Judge Harvey got the covered meaning.</p>

  <p>"I see. But what do they want to arrest you for?"</p>

  <p>"On a most absurd charge," answered Mr. Pyecroft,
  smiling,&mdash;but eyes straight into Judge Harvey's eyes. "They
  seem to think I am Thomas Preston."</p>

  <p>"Thomas Preston!" cried the Judge.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the man that forged those Jefferson letters you
  bought."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft saw the puzzled semi-recognition that he had
  observed in the Judge's face the night before flash into amazed,
  full recognition. Quickly but without appearance of haste, he
  stepped forward diverting attention from the Judge's face, and
  made himself the center of the party's eyes.</p>

  <p>"You see, lieutenant and officers," he said easily, filling in
  time to give Judge Harvey opportunity to recover and
  think&mdash;and still aiming his meaning at the Judge, "you see,
  I have here summoned before you the best possible witness to my
  identity. You threaten to arrest and expose me and two other
  persons in this house. Judge Harvey knows, as well as I know, how
  unfortunate it would be for these parties, and how displeasing to
  Mrs. De Peyster, if you should make the very great blunder of
  arresting me as Thomas Preston. Now, Judge Harvey,"&mdash;with a
  joking smile,&mdash;"you know who I am. Will you please inform
  the lieutenant whether I am the man you wish to have
  arrested?"</p>

  <p>Judge Harvey stared, silent, his face
  twitching.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id=
  "page223"></a>[pg 223]</span>

  <p>"Is what he says O.K., Judge?" queried Lieutenant Sullivan.
  "He ain't the man you want arrested?"</p>

  <p>"He is not," the Judge managed to get out.</p>

  <p>"From the way you hesitated&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Judge's hesitation, Lieutenant," Mr. Pyecroft interrupted
  in his pleasant tone, "was due to his amazement at the utter
  grotesqueness of the situation. He was for a moment utterly taken
  aback. That's it, isn't it, Judge?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Judge Harvey.</p>

  <p>The lieutenant twisted his derby in chagrined, ireful
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Some of my men have been damned fools again!" he exploded. He
  got himself back under control. "Judge Harvey, I hope you'll
  excuse our buttin' in like this&mdash;and&mdash;and won't find it
  necessary to mention it to the heads of the department."</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;it's all right," said the Judge.</p>

  <p>"And you, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Simpson&mdash;Archibald Simpson," supplied Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Simpson, I hope you don't mind this too much?"</p>

  <p>"No ill feeling at all, Lieutenant," Mr. Pyecroft said
  graciously. "Such little mistakes must occasionally occur in the
  most careful police work."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;and&mdash;there's another thing," said Lieutenant
  Sullivan with a note of gruff pleading. "You know how the papers
  are roasting the department <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page224" id="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span> just now. For every
  little slip, we get the harpoon or the laugh. I'll be obliged to
  you if you don't say anything that'll let this thing get into the
  papers."</p>

  <p>"Believe me, Lieutenant, I shall do everything in my power to
  protect you," Mr. Pyecroft assured him. "And now, since the
  matter is settled," he added pleasantly, "perhaps you'd like to
  have Matilda show you the way out. These upper hallways are
  really very confusing. Matilda, my dear,&mdash;if you don't
  mind."</p>

  <p>Wordlessly, Matilda obeyed, and four sets of policemen's feet
  went heavily down the stairs. Beneath her bedclothes Mrs. De
  Peyster began faintly, ever so faintly, to return to life. Judge
  Harvey glared at Mr. Pyecroft, hands spasmodically clutching and
  unclutching; his look grew darker and darker. Respectful,
  regretful, Mr. Pyecroft stood waiting.</p>

  <p>His left forefinger had not lost the place in
  "Wormwood."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id=
  "page225"></a>[pg 225]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <h3>THE THIRD FLIGHT</h3>

  <p>The storm broke.</p>

  <p>"You are a scoundrel, sir!" thundered the Judge.</p>

  <p>"I fear, sir, you are right," respectfully assented Mr.
  Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>"And what's more, you've made me lie to the police!"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly, sir," Mr. Pyecroft corrected mildly. "I was
  careful about that. I did not ask you to deny that I was Thomas
  Preston. I merely asked you if I was the man you wished arrested.
  You answered that you did not want me arrested; under the
  circumstances I am certain you spoke the truth. And in explaining
  your hesitation to the lieutenant, when you said it was due to
  your utter amazement at the grotesqueness of the situation, I am
  certain you there also spoke the truth."</p>

  <p>"You are a quibbler!" fumed the outraged Judge. "You made me
  lie to the police!"</p>

  <p>"Well, even if I did," returned Mr. Pyecroft in his same mild
  tone, "is there any one else you would rather lie to?"</p>

  <p>The Judge glared, almost choking. "Have you no respect, man,
  for common decency&mdash;for order&mdash;for the
  law?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id=
  "page226"></a>[pg 226]</span>

  <p>"For order and decency, yes,&mdash;but as for ordinary law, I
  fear I have no more respect than your honor has," Mr. Pyecroft
  admitted gravely. "And I acquired my irreverence toward law just
  as your honor did&mdash;from studying it."</p>

  <p>Judge Harvey stared.</p>

  <p>"What! You're a lawyer?"</p>

  <p>"I have been admitted to the bar, and have been a law clerk,
  but have never practiced for myself."</p>

  <p>"But last night you said you were a clergyman!"</p>

  <p>"I have gone no deeper into theology, sir, than the price of a
  clerical suit. And that was for its moral effect on the
  police."</p>

  <p>"Sir," exploded the Judge, "you are utterly incorrigible!"</p>

  <p>"I trust that I am not, sir," submitted Mr. Pyecroft gravely,
  hopefully.</p>

  <p>At that moment Jack and Mary appeared on tiptoe in the
  doorway, alive with curiosity; and directly behind them came
  Matilda. Upon the latter Judge Harvey turned.</p>

  <p>"Well, Matilda, I certainly want to compliment you on your
  brother!" he exclaimed with irate sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"My bro&mdash;bro&mdash;yes, sir, thank you," weakly returned
  poor Matilda.</p>

  <p>"No wonder, Mr. Simpson," the outraged Judge continued, "that
  your family disowned you!"</p>

  <p>"They were justified, certainly, as I told you at the very
  first," soberly conceded Mr. Pyecroft.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg 227]</span>

  <p>Jack and Mary demanded enlightenment. To them Judge Harvey
  told of the visit of the four police officers, scathingly
  expounded the character of Matilda's brother, and explained how
  he, Judge Harvey, had been forced to protect the outrageous
  scape-grace. Through this recital, Mr. Pyecroft, though unbowed
  by shame, continued to wear his respectful, regretful look.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will not believe me, Judge Harvey," he returned
  courteously, and with the ring of sincerity, when the indictment
  was ended, "and even if you do believe me, perhaps my statement
  will mean nothing to you; but I desire none the less to state
  that I am sorry that you were the person to be deceived by those
  Jefferson letters. Of course, I had no idea to whom they were to
  be sold. I did them for the autograph dealer, so much for the
  job&mdash;and did them partly as a lark, though, of course, I do
  not expect you to appreciate the humor of the affair. It may be
  some consolation to you, however, to know that I profited very
  little from the transaction; the dealer got over ninety per cent
  of the price you paid."</p>

  <p>The Judge snorted, and stalked incredulously and wrathfully
  out, Jack and Mary behind him; and Mrs. De Peyster was left alone
  in the bosom of her family. Mr. Pyecroft sat silent on the foot
  of the bed for a space, grave but composed, gazing at a
  particular scale of the flaking kalsomine. Then he remarked
  something about its having been a somewhat <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span>
  trying day and that he believed that he'd be off to bed.</p>

  <p>When he was gone Mrs. De Peyster lay wordless, limp, all
  a-shiver. Beside her sat the limp and voiceless Matilda, gasping
  and staring wildly. How long Mrs. De Peyster lay in that
  condition she never knew. All her faculties were reeling. These
  crowding events seemed the wildest series of unrealities; seemed
  the frenzied, feverish phantasms of a nightmare. They never,
  never could possibly-have happened!</p>

  <p>But then ... they had happened! And this hard, narrow bed was
  real. And this low, narrow room was real. And Mr. Pyecroft was
  real. And so were Jack, and Mary, and Judge Harvey.</p>

  <p>These things could never have happened. But, then, they had.
  And would they ever, ever stop happening?</p>

  <p>This was only the eighth day since her promulgated sailing.
  Three more months, ninety days of twenty-four hours each, before
  Olivetta&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Matilda," she burst out in a despairing whisper, "I can't
  stand this another minute!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ma'am!" wailed Matilda.</p>

  <p>"That Mr. Pyecroft&mdash;" Words failed her. "I've simply got
  to get out of this somehow!"</p>

  <p>"Of course, ma'am. But&mdash;but our changes haven't helped us
  much yet. If we tried to leave the house, that Mr. Pyecroft might
  follow and we might find ourselves even in a worse way than we
  are, ma'am."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id=
  "page229"></a>[pg 229]</span>

  <p>"Nothing can be worse than this!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure, ma'am," tremulously doubted Matilda. "We
  never dreamed anything could be so bad as this, but here this
  is."</p>

  <p>There was a vague logic in what Matilda said; but logic none
  the less. Unbelievable, and yet so horribly actual as this
  was,&mdash;was what had thus far happened only the <i>legato</i>
  and <i>pianissimo</i> passages of their adventure, with
  <i>crescendo</i> and <i>fortissimo</i> still ahead? Mrs. De
  Peyster closed her eyes, and did not speak. She strove to regain
  some command over her routed faculties.</p>

  <p>Matilda waited.</p>

  <p>Presently Mrs. De Peyster's eyes opened. "It would be some
  relief"&mdash;weak hope was in her voice&mdash;"if only I could
  manage to get down into my own suite."</p>

  <p>"But, ma'am, with that Mr. Pyecroft&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's a risk we've got to run," Mrs. De Peyster cried
  desperately. "We've somehow got to manage to get me there without
  his knowing it."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she sat up. The hope that a moment before had shone
  faintly in her face began to become a more confident glow.
  Matilda saw that her mistress was thinking; therefore she
  remained silent, expectant.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, I think there's a chance!" Mrs. De Peyster exclaimed
  after a moment. "I'll get into my suite&mdash;I'll live there
  quiet as death. Since they believe the suite empty, since they
  know it is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id=
  "page230"></a>[pg 230]</span> locked, they may never suspect any
  one is in it. Matilda, it's the only way!"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but, ma'am, how am I to explain your sudden
  disappearance?"</p>

  <p>"Say that your sister became homesick," said Mrs. De Peyster
  with mounting hope, "and decided suddenly, in the middle of the
  night, to return at once to her home in Syracuse."</p>

  <p>"That may satisfy all but Mr. Pyecroft, ma'am. But Mr.
  Pyecroft won't believe it."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pyecroft will have to believe whatever he likes. It's the
  only way, and we're going to do it. And do it at once! Matilda,
  go down and see if they're all asleep yet, particularly Mr.
  Pyecroft."</p>

  <p>Matilda took off her shoes and in her stocking-feet went
  scouting forth; and stocking-footed presently returned, with the
  news that all seemed asleep, particularly Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, in Matilda's dress, and likewise in
  stocking-feet, Mrs. De Peyster stepped out of her second maid's
  room. Breathless, she listened. Not a sound. Then, Matilda at her
  heels, she began to creep down the
  stairway&mdash;slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;putting each foot down
  with the softness of a closing lip&mdash;pausing with straining
  ears on every tread. With up-pressing feet she glided by the door
  within which Mr. Pyecroft lay in untroubled sleep, then started
  by the room that homed Jack and Mary, creeping with the footsteps
  of a disembodied spirit, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"
  id="page231"></a>[pg 231]</span> fearful every second lest some
  door might spring open and wild alarms ring out.</p>

  <p>But she got safely by. Then, more rapidly, yet still as
  noiseless as a shadow's shadow, she crept on
  down&mdash;down&mdash;until she came to her own door. Here the
  attending Matilda silently vanished. With velvet touch Mrs. De
  Peyster slipped her key into the lock, stepped inside,
  noiselessly closed and locked the door behind her.</p>

  <p>Then she sank into a chair, and breathed. Just breathed ...
  back once more in the spacious suite wherein nine days
  ago&mdash;or was it nine thousand years?&mdash;inspiration had
  flowered within her and her great idea had been
  born.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id=
  "page232"></a>[pg 232]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <h3>A PLEASANT HERMITAGE</h3>

  <p>When she awoke, it was with a sweet, languorous sense of
  perfect comfort. Heavy-lidded, she glanced about her. Ah! Once
  more she was in her own wide, gracious bed&mdash;of a different
  caste, of an entirely different race, from the second maid's
  paving-stone pallet, from that folding, punitive contrivance from
  whose output of anguish Mrs. Gilbert managed to extract a profit.
  Also she was in sweet, ingratiating linen&mdash;the first fresh
  personal linen that had touched her in nine days.</p>

  <p>It was all as though she were enfolded deep in the embrace of
  a not too fervent benediction.</p>

  <p>About her were the large, dignified spaces of her bedroom, and
  beyond were the yet greater spaces of her sitting-room; and from
  where she lay she could see the gleaming white of her large tiled
  bathroom. And there were drawers and drawers of fresh
  <i>lingerie</i>; and there were her closets filled with
  comfortable gowns that would be a thousand times more grateful
  after a week of Matilda's unchanged and oppressive black. And
  there on her dressing-table were the multitudinous implements of
  silver that had to do with her toilet.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg 233]</span>

  <p>After what she had been through, this, indeed, was
  comfort.</p>

  <p>But as consciousness grew clearer, her forgotten troubles and
  her dangers returned to her. For a brief period alarm possessed
  her. Then reason began to assert itself; and the hope which the
  night before had been hardly more than desperation began to take
  on the character of confidence. She saw possibilities. And the
  longer she considered, the more and greater the possibilities
  were. Her original plan began to re-present itself to her;
  modified, of course, to meet the altered conditions. If she could
  only remain here, undiscovered, then months hence, when it was
  announced that Mrs. De Peyster (she sent up a warm prayer for
  Olivetta!) was homeward bound, Jack and Mary and that unthinkable
  Mr. Pyecroft would decamp, if they had not gone before, and leave
  the way clear for the easy interchange by Olivetta and herself of
  their several personalities.</p>

  <p>As she lay there in the gentle Sabbath calm, in the
  extra-curled hair of her ultra-superior mattress, this revised
  version of her plan, in the first glow of its conception, seemed
  alluringly plausible. She had to be more careful, to be sure, but
  aside from this the new plan seemed quite as good as the
  original. In fact, in her reaction from the alarms of yesterday,
  it somehow seemed even better.</p>

  <p>Twelve hours before there had seemed no possible solution to
  her predicament. And here it was&mdash;come unexpectedly to her
  aid, as was the way with <span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"
  id="page234"></a>[pg 234]</span> things in life; and a very
  simple solution, too. Lazily, hazily, a poet's line teased and
  evaded her memory. What was it?&mdash;something about "a pleasant
  hermitage." That was just what this was: a pleasant
  hermitage.</p>

  <p>But presently, as she lay comforting herself, and the morning
  wore on, she became increasingly conscious of an indefinable
  uncomfortable sensation. And presently the sensation became more
  definite; became localized; and she was aware that she was
  growing hungry. And in the same moment came the dismaying
  realization that, in their haste of the night before, she had not
  thought to plan with Matilda for the somewhat essential item of
  food!</p>

  <p>She sat up. What was she ever to do? Three months of solitary
  confinement, with no arrangements for food! Would Matilda have
  the sense to think of this, and if so would she have the
  adroitness to smuggle edibles in to her unnoticed? Or was she to
  be starved out?</p>

  <p>The revised plan had lost its first rose-tint.</p>

  <p>She got up, and noiselessly foraged throughout her quarters.
  The total of her gleaning was a box of forgotten chocolate
  bon-bons and a box of half-length tallow candles. She had read
  that Esquimaux ate tallow, or its equivalent, and prospered
  famously upon it; but she deferred the candles in favor of the
  bon-bons, and breakfasted on half the box.</p>

  <p>Then she went back to bed and read. In the afternoon she ate
  the second half of the bon-bons.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg 235]</span>

  <p>Also in the afternoon she discovered that the bliss of lying
  abed, which she had thought would be exhaustless, had
  inexplicably become transmitted into boredom. And yet she dared
  not move about, save with a caution that amounted almost to pain;
  for she had heard Jack and Mary and Mr. Pyecroft pass and re-pass
  her door, and she knew that any slight noise on her part might
  result in disastrous betrayal.</p>

  <p>Evening drew on. Bed, and sitting noiseless in one spot, grew
  more wearisome. And her stomach began to complain bitterly, for
  as has been remarked it was a pampered creature and had been long
  accustomed to being served sumptuously and with deferential
  promptitude. But she realized that Matilda would not dare come,
  if she remembered to come at all, until the household was fast
  asleep.</p>

  <p>Eight o'clock came. She lit one of the candles and placed it,
  cautiously shaded, in a corner of her sitting-room....</p>

  <p>Ten o'clock came.</p>

  <p>She looked meditatively at the box of candles. Perhaps the
  Esquimaux ate them with a kind of sauce. They might not be so bad
  that way....</p>

  <p>Midnight came. Shortly thereafter a faint, ever so faint,
  knocking sent her tiptoeing&mdash;for months she would dare move
  only on breathless tiptoe!&mdash;to the door of her sitting-room,
  where she stood and listened.</p>

  <p>Again the faint knocking sounded.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg 236]</span>

  <p>"Mrs. De Peyster, it's Matilda," whispered an agitated
  voice.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster quickly unlocked and opened the door. Matilda
  slipped in and the door was softly closed upon her back.</p>

  <p>"Here's some food&mdash;just what I could grab in a
  second&mdash;I didn't dare take time to choose." Matilda held out
  a bundle wrapped in a newspaper. "Take it, ma'am. I don't dare
  stay here a second."</p>

  <p>But Mrs. De Peyster caught her arm.</p>

  <p>"How did they take my going?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jack thought home was really the best place for my
  sister, if she was sick, ma'am. And Mary was awfully kind and
  asked me all sorts of questions&mdash;which&mdash;which I found
  it awfully hard to answer, ma'am,&mdash;and she is going to send
  you the book you didn't finish. And Mr. Pyecroft got me off into
  a corner and said, so we'd tried to give him the slip again."</p>

  <p>"What is he going to do?"</p>

  <p>"He said he was safe here, under Judge Harvey's protection.
  Outside some detective might insist on arresting him, and perhaps
  things might take such a turn that even Judge Harvey might not be
  able to help him. So he said he was going to stay on here till
  things blew over. Oh, please, ma'am, let me go, for if they were
  to hear me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A minute later the chattering Matilda was out of the room, the
  door was locked, and Mrs. De Peyster was sitting in a chair with
  the bundle of provisions <span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"
  id="page237"></a>[pg 237]</span> on her exquisitely lacquered
  tea-table. In the newspaper was a small loaf of bread, a tin of
  salmon, and a kitchen knife. That was all. Not even butter! And,
  of course, no coffee&mdash;she who liked coffee, strong, three
  times a day. But when was she ever again to know the taste of
  coffee!</p>

  <p>Never before had she sat face to face with such an
  uninteresting menu. But she devoured it&mdash;opening the tin of
  salmon after great effort with the knife&mdash;devoured it every
  bit. Then she noticed the newspaper in which the provisions had
  been wrapped. It was part of that day's, Sunday's, "Record," and
  it was the illustrated supplement. This she unfolded, and before
  her eyes stood a big-lettered title, "Annual Exodus of Society
  Leaders," and in the queenly place in the center of the page was
  her own portrait by M. Dubois.</p>

  <p>Her eyes wandered up to the original, which was dimly
  illumined by the rays of her one candle. What poise, what
  breeding, what calm, imperturbable dignity! Then her gaze came
  back to her be-crumbed tea-table, with the kitchen knife and the
  raggedly gaping can. She slipped rather limply down in her chair
  and covered her eyes.</p>

  <p>A day passed&mdash;and another&mdash;and another. Outside Mrs.
  De Peyster's suite these days flew by with honeymoon rapidity;
  within, they lingered, and clung on, and seemed determined never
  to go, as is time's malevolent practice with those imprisoned.
  Mrs. De Peyster could hear Mary practicing, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg 238]</span> and
  practicing hard&mdash;and, yes, brilliantly. As for Jack, Matilda
  told her on her later visits&mdash;and her later bundles
  contained a larger and more palatable supply of food than had the
  first package&mdash;Matilda said that Jack, too, was working
  hard. Furthermore, Matilda admitted, the pair were having the
  jolliest of honeymoons.</p>

  <p>And a further thing Matilda told on her third furtive,
  after-midnight visit. This concerned Mr. Pyecroft. Mr. Pyecroft,
  it seemed, was becoming an even greater favorite with Jack and
  Mary&mdash;particularly with Mary. He had confided to them that
  he was weary of his escapades, and wanted to settle down; in
  fact, there was a girl&mdash;the nicest girl in the world,
  begging Mary's pardon&mdash;who had promised to marry him as soon
  as he had become launched in honorable work. The trouble was, he
  knew that no business man would employ him in a responsible
  capacity, and so his last departures from strict rectitude had
  been for the purpose of securing the capital to set himself up in
  some small but independent way.</p>

  <p>His story, Matilda admitted, had captured Mary's heart.</p>

  <p>Judge Harvey, however, still smarting under his indignity,
  would on his evening calls scarcely speak to Mr. Pyecroft.
  Nonetheless, Mr. Pyecroft had continued regretful and polite.
  Once or twice, Judge Harvey, forgetting his resentment, had been
  drawn into discussions of points of law with Mr. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg 239]</span>
  Pyecroft. To Matilda, who, of course, knew nothing about law, it
  had seemed that Mr. Pyecroft talked almost as well as the Judge
  himself. But the Judge, the instant he remembered himself,
  resumed his ire toward Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>Thus three days, in which it seemed to Mrs. De Peyster that
  Time stood still and taunted her,&mdash;each day exactly like the
  day before, a day of half starvation, of tiptoed, breathless
  routine,&mdash;days in which she spoke not a word save a whisper
  or two at midnight at the food-bearing visit of the sad-visaged
  Matilda,&mdash;three dull, diabolic days dragged by their
  interminable length of hours. Such days!&mdash;such awful, awful
  days!</p>

  <p>On Matilda's fourth visit with her usual bundle of pilferings
  from the pantry, Mrs. De Peyster observed in the manner of that
  disconsolate pirate a great deal of suppressed agitation&mdash;of
  a sort hardly ascribable to the danger of their situation: an
  agitation quite different from mere nervous fear. There were
  traces of recent crying in Matilda's face, and now and then she
  had difficulty in holding down a sob. Mrs. De Peyster pressed her
  as to the trouble; Matilda chokingly replied that there was
  nothing. Mrs. De Peyster persisted, and soon Matilda was weeping
  openly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my heart's broke, ma'am!" she sobbed. "My heart's
  broke!"</p>

  <p>"Your heart broken! How?"</p>

  <p>"Before I can tell you, ma'am," cried the miserable
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg
  240]</span> Matilda, "I've got to make a confession. I've
  done&mdash;something awful! I've disobeyed you, ma'am! I've
  disobeyed and deceived you!"</p>

  <p>"What, Matilda," said Mrs. De Peyster severely, "after the way
  I've trusted you for twenty years!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am. But, I couldn't help it, ma'am! There's feelings
  one can't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what have you done?"</p>

  <p>"I've&mdash;I've fallen in love, ma'am. For over a year I've
  been the same as engaged to William."</p>

  <p>"William!" cried Mrs. De Peyster, sinking back from her erect,
  reproving posture, and recalling an unforgettable episode.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am,&mdash;to William. I'm sorry I disobeyed you,
  ma'am,&mdash;very sorry,&mdash;but I can't think about that now.
  For now," sobbed Matilda, "for now it's all off&mdash;and my
  heart is broke!"</p>

  <p>"All off? Why?" breathed Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"That's what I can't understand, ma'am," wailed Matilda. "It's
  all a mystery to me. I've hardly seen William, and haven't spoken
  to him, since we came back, and he's acted awfully queer to me.
  I&mdash;I couldn't stand it any longer, and this evening I went
  out to the stable to see him. He was as stiff, and as polite, and
  as mad as&mdash;oh, William was never like that to me before,
  ma'am! I asked him what was the matter. 'All right, if you want
  to break off, I'm willing!' he said in, oh, such a hard voice.
  'But, William,' I said, beginning to cry, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg 241]</span>
  'but, William, what have I ever done to you?' 'You know what
  you've done!' he said."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" breathed Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"I begged him to explain, but he just turned his back on me
  and walked away! And now, ma'am," wept Matilda, "I know he'll
  never explain, he's such a proud, obstinate, stiff-necked man!
  And I love him so, Mrs. De Peyster,&mdash;I love him so! Oh, my
  heart is broke!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster gazed at her sobbing serving-woman in chilled
  dismay. She was for a moment impelled to explain to Matilda; but
  she quickly realized it would never, never do for her housekeeper
  to know that her coachman had made love to her, and had&mdash;had
  even kissed her. Every drop of De Peyster blood revolted against
  such a degradation.</p>

  <p>"I hope it will come out all right, Matilda," she said in a
  shaking voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it never can!" Matilda had already started for the door.
  She paused, hesitant, with the knob in her hand. "But you,
  ma'am," she faltered, "can you ever forgive me for the way I
  deceived you?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster tried to look severe, yet relenting.</p>

  <p>"I'll try to overlook it, Matilda."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, ma'am," snuffled Matilda; and very humbly she went
  out.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id=
  "page242"></a>[pg 242]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <h3>MATILDA BREAKS IT GENTLY</h3>

  <p>At two o'clock of the fifth night Matilda stole into Mrs. De
  Peyster with a face that would have been an apt cover for the
  Book of Lamentations. She opened her pages. That day she had had
  a telegram that her sister Angelica&mdash;the really and truly
  Angelica, who really and truly lived near Syracuse&mdash;that
  Angelica was seriously ill. She was sorry, but she felt that she
  must go.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you must go, Matilda!" exclaimed Mrs. De Peyster.
  Then the significance to her of Matilda's absence flashed upon
  her. "But what will I do without any company at all?" she cried.
  "And without any food?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen to the food, ma'am." And Matilda explained that
  during the evening, in preparation for her going, she had been
  smuggling into the house from Sixth Avenue delicatessen stores
  boxes of crackers, cold meats, all varieties of canned
  goods&mdash;"enough to last you for a month, ma'am, and by that
  time I'll be back."</p>

  <p>Her explanation made, Matilda proceeded, with extremest
  caution, to carry the provisions up and stack them in one corner
  of Mrs. De Peyster's large, white-tiled bathroom. When the
  freightage was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id=
  "page243"></a>[pg 243]</span> over, the bathroom, with its supply
  of crackers and zweibach, its bottles of olives and pickles, its
  cold tongue, cold roast beef, cold chicken, its cans of salmon,
  sardines, deviled ham, California peaches, and condensed
  milk&mdash;the bathroom was itself a delicatessen shop that many
  an ambitious young German would have regarded as a proud start in
  life.</p>

  <p>"But what about food for the others while you're gone?"
  inquired Mrs. De Peyster&mdash;with a sudden hope that the others
  would be starved into leaving.</p>

  <p>"I've attended to them, ma'am. I've bought a lot of things
  that will keep. And then I told the tradespeople that my niece
  was going to be here in my place, and they are to deliver milk
  and other fresh things for her every day in care of William."</p>

  <p>Matilda broke down at the last moment.</p>

  <p>"If it wasn't for you, ma'am, I wouldn't care if it was me
  that was sick, instead of my sister, and if I never got well. For
  with William&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She could say no more, and departed adrip with tears.</p>

  <p>Matilda's nightly visits were a loss; but Mrs. De Peyster had
  come to take her situation more and more philosophically. The
  life was unspeakably tedious, to be sure, and rather dangerous,
  too; but she had accepted the predicament&mdash;it had to be
  endured and could not be helped; and such a state of mind made
  her circumstances much easier to support. All in all, there was
  no reason, though, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id=
  "page244"></a>[pg 244]</span> of course, it was most
  uncomfortable&mdash;there was no good reason, she kept assuring
  herself, why she might not safely withstand the siege and come
  out of the affair with none but her two confidants being the
  wiser.</p>

  <p>In this philosophic mood three more days passed&mdash;passed
  slowly and tediously, to be sure, but yet they did get by. There
  were relaxations, of course,&mdash;things to occupy her mind. She
  read a little each day; she listened to Mary's concert in the
  drawing-room below her&mdash;for Mary dared to continue playing
  despite Matilda's absence, since it was known that Matilda's
  niece was in the house, though Mary never showed her face; she
  listened for snatches of the conversation of Jack and Mary and
  Mr. Pyecroft when they passed her door; at times she stood upon a
  chair at one of her windows and cautiously peered through the
  little panes in her shutters, like the lens of a camera, down
  into the sunny green of Washington Square.</p>

  <p>Also, of evenings, she found herself straining to hear the
  voice of Judge Harvey. When she surprised herself at this, she
  would flush slightly, and again raise her book close to her
  shaded candle.</p>

  <p>Then, of course, her meals were a diversion. She became quite
  expert with the can-opener and the corkscrew. The empty cans,
  since there was no way to get them out of her suite, she stacked
  on the side of the bathroom opposite her provisions; and daily
  the stack grew higher.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"
  id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span>

  <p>The nearest approach to an incident during this solitary
  period came to pass on the third night after Matilda's departure.
  On that evening Mrs. De Peyster became aware of a new voice in
  the house&mdash;a voice with a French accent. It seemed familiar,
  yet for a time she was puzzled as to the identity of the voice's
  owner. Then suddenly she knew: the man below was M. Dubois, whom
  Olivetta, at her desire, had with unwilling but obedient
  frostiness sent about his business. She had known that Jack had
  taken up with M. Dubois at the time the artist was doing her
  portrait; but she had not known that Jack was so intimate as the
  artist's being admitted to Jack's secret seemed to indicate.</p>

  <p>Within herself, some formless, incomprehensible thing seemed
  about to happen. During these days of solitude&mdash;and this,
  too, even before Matilda had gone&mdash;a queer new something had
  begun to stir within her, almost as though threatening an
  eruption. It seemed a force, or spirit, rising darkly from
  hitherto unknown spaces of her being. It frightened her, with its
  amorphous, menacing strangeness. She tried to keep it down. She
  tried to keep her mental eyes away from it. And so, during all
  these days, she had no idea what the fearsome thing might
  be....</p>

  <p>And then something did happen. On the fifth day after
  Matilda's departure, and the eighteenth after the sailing of the
  Plutonia, Mrs. De Peyster observed a sudden change in the
  atmosphere of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id=
  "page246"></a>[pg 246]</span> house. Within an hour, from being
  filled with honeymoon hilarity, the house became filled with
  gloom. There was no more laughter&mdash;no more running up and
  down the stairs and through the hallways&mdash;the piano's song
  was silent. Mrs. De Peyster sought to gain some clue to this
  mysterious change by listening for the talk of Mary and Jack and
  Mr. Pyecroft as they passed her door. But whereas the trio had
  heretofore spoken freely and often in liveliest tones, they now
  were either wordless or their voices were solemnly hushed.</p>

  <p>What did it mean? Days passed&mdash;the solemn gloom continued
  unabated&mdash;and this question grew an ever more puzzling
  mystery to Mrs. De Peyster. What could it possibly,
  <i>possibly</i>, mean?</p>

  <p>But there was no way in which she could find out. Her only
  source of information was Matilda, and Matilda was gone for a
  month; and even if Matilda, by any chance, should know what was
  the matter, she would not dare write; and even if she wrote, the
  letter, of course, would never be delivered, but would doubtless
  be forwarded to the pretended Mrs. De Peyster in Europe. Mrs. De
  Peyster could only wonder&mdash;and read&mdash;and gaze furtively
  out of the little peep-holes of her prison&mdash;and
  eat&mdash;and stack the empty cans yet higher in her
  bathroom&mdash;and wait, impatiently wait, while the mystery grew
  daily and hourly in magnitude.</p>

  <p>Among the details that added to the mystery's bulk was the
  sound of another new but familiar <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page247" id="page247"></a>[pg 247]</span> voice&mdash;the voice
  of the competent Miss Gardner, her discharged secretary. And Miss
  Gardner's voice was not heard for an hour and then heard no
  more&mdash;but was heard day after day, and her tone was the tone
  of a person who is acquainted with the management of an
  establishment and who is giving necessary orders. And another
  detail was that William no longer kept to the stable, but seemed
  now constantly busy within the house. And another detail was that
  she became aware that Jack and Mary no longer tried to keep their
  presence in the house a secret, but went openly forth into the
  streets together. And Judge Harvey every day came openly to see
  them.</p>

  <p>But the most bewildering, and yet most clarifying, detail of
  all was one she observed on the twelfth day since Matilda's
  going, the twenty-fifth of her own official absence.</p>

  <p>On that afternoon she was standing on a chair entertaining
  herself by gazing through one of her shutters, when she saw Jack
  crossing Washington Square. He was walking very soberly, and
  about the left sleeve of a quiet gray summer suit was a band of
  crape.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster stepped down from her chair. The mystery was
  lifting. Somebody was dead! But who? Who?</p>

  <p>Early the next morning, while the inmates of the house were
  occupied in the serving or the eating of breakfast, Mrs. De
  Peyster was startled by a soft <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page248" id="page248"></a>[pg 248]</span> knocking at her door.
  But instantly she was reassured by the tremulous accents
  without.</p>

  <p>"It's me, ma'am,&mdash;Matilda. Let me in&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>The next instant the door opened and Matilda half staggered,
  half fell, into the room. But such a Matilda! Shivering all over,
  eyes wildly staring.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" cried Mrs. De Peyster, seizing her housekeeper's
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Oh, ma&mdash;ma&mdash;ma'am," chattered Matilda.
  "It's&mdash;it's awful!"</p>

  <p>"But what is it?" demanded Mrs. De Peyster, beginning to
  tremble with an unknown terror.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's&mdash;it's awful! I couldn't get you word
  before&mdash;for I didn't dare write, and my sister wasn't well
  enough for me to leave her till last night."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster shook the shaking Matilda.</p>

  <p>"Will you please tell me what's happened!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma&mdash;ma'am. Here's a copy of the first paper that
  had anything about it. The paper's over a week old. I brought it
  along to&mdash;to break the thing to you gently."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster seized the newspaper. In the center of its
  first page was a reproduction of M. Dubois's painting of herself,
  and across the paper's top ran the giant
  headline:&mdash;</p><span class="pagenum"></span>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster sank without a word into a chair, and her face
  duplicated the ashen hue of Matilda's.</p>

  <p>Matilda likewise collapsed into a chair. "Oh, isn't it awful,
  ma'am," she moaned.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;so it's I&mdash;that's&mdash;that's dead!" mumbled
  Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am. But that isn't all. I&mdash;I thought I'd break
  it to you gently. That was over a week ago. Since
  then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean," breathed the marble lips of Mrs. De Peyster, "that
  there's something more?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am. Oh, the papers have been full of it. It's been a
  tremendous sensation!"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" gasped Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Jack, since you died without a will, is your heir.
  And, since he is now the head of the De Peyster family, the first
  thing he did on hearing the news was to arrange by cable to have
  your body sent here."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster, as though galvanized, half rose from her
  chair.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;my body&mdash;is coming here?"</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg 250]</span>

  <p>"I said I was trying to break it to you gently," moaned
  Matilda. "It's&mdash;it's already here. The ship that brought it
  is now docking. Your funeral&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My funeral!"</p>

  <p>"It takes place in the drawing-room, this morning. Oh, isn't
  it awful! But, perhaps, ma'am, if you could see what beautiful
  flowers your friends have sent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Mrs. De Peyster had very softly sunk back into her
  chair.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id=
  "page251"></a>[pg 251]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <h3>THE VEILED LADY</h3>

  <p>As soon as that huddled mass of womanhood that was Mrs. De
  Peyster had become sufficiently reanimated to be able to think,
  its first thought came in the form of an unuttered wail.</p>

  <p>She was dead! She was to be buried! She could never come home
  again!</p>

  <p>Or if she did come home, what a scandal! A scandal
  out-scandalizing anything of which she had ever dreamed! A
  scandal worse ten times than the very grave itself!</p>

  <p>With loose face and glazed eyes she stared at Matilda while
  the latter stammered out disjointed details of the past week's
  happenings. As for Mr. Jack's lark in dwelling surreptitiously
  with his wife in his mother's house, not a breath of that had
  reached the public. With Mr. Pyecroft's aid, and Judge Harvey's,
  he had managed this well. He had told the reporters that he had
  been quietly married over three weeks before, that he and his
  wife had been living in seclusion, and that on learning of his
  mother's demise they had come to the house to direct the
  obsequies.... Those Paris police were trying to solve the mystery
  of what had become of Mrs. De Peyster's trunks.... If Mrs. De
  Peyster <span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id=
  "page252"></a>[pg 252]</span> could only see the beautiful floral
  tributes that were arriving, particularly the large wreath sent
  by Mrs. Allistair&mdash;</p>

  <p>But Mrs. De Peyster heard none of this. She was dead! She was
  to be buried! She could never come home again!</p>

  <p>At length her lips moved&mdash;slowly, stiffly, as might the
  lips of a dead person.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I've been saying that same question to myself for days,
  ma'am," quavered Matilda. "And I&mdash;I don't see any
  answer."</p>

  <p>No, there was nothing she could do. Mrs. De Peyster continued
  her glazed stare at her faithful serving-woman. In the first few
  minutes her mind had been able to take in the significance only
  to herself of this culminating disaster. But now its significance
  to another person shivered through that her being.</p>

  <p>Poor&mdash;poor Olivetta!</p>

  <p>For Olivetta, of course, it was. Mrs. De Peyster knew what was
  due the De Peyster corpuscles that moved in stately procession
  along the avenues of her blood, and was not neglectful to see
  that that due was properly observed; but the heart from which
  those corpuscles derived their impulse was, as Judge Harvey had
  once said, in its way the kindest sort of heart. And now, for a
  few minutes, all that her heart could feel was felt for
  Olivetta.</p>

  <p>But for a few minutes only. Then Olivetta, and <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg 253]</span> all
  concerns beyond the immediate moment, were suddenly forgotten.
  For in the hall without soft footsteps were heard, and the
  instant after, upon her door, there sounded an ominous
  scratching&mdash;a sound like a key in an agitated hand searching
  for its appointed hole.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster rose up and clutched Matilda's arm, and stood
  in rigid terror.</p>

  <p>"Tha&mdash;that key?" chattered Matilda. "Can&mdash;can it
  fit?"</p>

  <p>"There were only two keys," breathed Mrs. De Peyster. "Mine
  here, and the one I gave to Olivetta."</p>

  <p>"Then it can't fit, since Miss Olivetta's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the key gave Matilda the lie direct by slipping into the
  lock. The two women clung to one another, knowing that the end
  had come, wondering who was to be their exposer. The bolt clicked
  back, the door swung open, and&mdash;</p>

  <p>And into the dusky room there tottered a rather tall, heavily
  veiled, feminine figure. It did not gaze at the shrinking couple
  in astoundment. It did not launch into exclamation at its
  discovery. Instead, it sank weakly down into the nearest
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" it moaned. "Oh! Oh! Oh!"</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who are you?" huskily demanded Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Oh!" moaned the figure. "Isn't it terrible! Isn't it
  terrible! But I didn't mean to do it&mdash;I didn't mean to do
  it, Caroline!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id=
  "page254"></a>[pg 254]</span>

  <p>"It's not&mdash;not Olivetta?" gasped Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"It was an accident!" the figure wailed on. "I couldn't help
  myself. And if you knew what I've gone through to get here, I
  know you'd forgive me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster had lifted the veil up over the hat.</p>

  <p>"Olivetta! Then&mdash;after all&mdash;you're not dead!"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;if I only were!" sobbed Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"Then who is that&mdash;that person who's coming here this
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know!" Then Olivetta's quavering voice grew hard with
  indignation. "It's somebody who's trying to get a good funeral
  under false pretenses!"</p>

  <p>"But the papers said the body had on my clothes."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I suppose it must have had."</p>

  <p>"But how&mdash;" Mrs. De Peyster recalled their precarious
  position. "Matilda, lock the door. But, Olivetta, how could it
  ever, ever have happened?"</p>

  <p>"I followed your directions&mdash;and got to Paris all
  right&mdash;and everything was going splendid&mdash;and I was
  beginning to enjoy myself&mdash;when&mdash;when&mdash;Oh,
  Caroline, I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You what?" demanded Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"I lost my purse!" sobbed Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"Lost your purse?"</p>

  <p>"I left it in a cab when I went to the Louvre. And in it was
  all my money&mdash;my letter of
  credit&mdash;everything!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page255" id="page255"></a>[pg 25]</span>

  <p>"Olivetta!"</p>

  <p>"And I didn't dare cable you for more. For if I had sent a
  cable to you here, it might have betrayed you."</p>

  <p>"And what did you do?"</p>

  <p>"There was nothing for me to do but to&mdash;to&mdash;sell
  some of your gowns."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Mrs. De Peyster was beginning dimly to see the drift of
  things.</p>

  <p>Olivetta's mind wandered to another phase of her
  tribulations.</p>

  <p>"And the price I got for them was a swindle, Caroline. It
  was&mdash;it was a tragedy! For your black chiffon, and your
  silver satin, and your spangled net&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But this person they took for me?" interrupted Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Oh, whoever she is, she must have bought one of them. She
  could have bought it for nothing&mdash;and that Frenchman who
  cheated me&mdash;would have doubled his money. And after she
  bought it&mdash;she&mdash;she"&mdash;Olivetta's voice rang out
  with hysterical resentment&mdash;"she got us all into this
  trouble by walking into the Seine. It's the most popular pastime
  in Paris, to walk into the Seine. But why," ended Olivetta with a
  spiteful burst,&mdash;"why couldn't she have amused herself in
  her own clothes? That's what I want to know!"</p>

  <p>"And then? What did you do?" breathed Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id=
  "page256"></a>[pg 256]</span>

  <p>"When it came out three days later that it was you, I was
  so&mdash;so frightened that I didn't know what to do. I didn't
  dare deny the report, for that would have been to expose you. And
  I didn't dare cable to you that it was all a mistake and that I
  was all right, for that would have been just as bad. Perhaps I
  might have acted differently, but I&mdash;well, I ran away. I
  crossed to London with your trunks. There I learned
  that&mdash;that they were sending your remains home. I realized I
  had to get you word somehow, and I realized the only way was for
  me to come and tell you. So I sold some more of your gowns, and
  just caught the Mauretania, and here I am."</p>

  <p>So ending, Olivetta, as though her bones had melted, subsided
  into a gelatinous heap of dejection, dabbing her crimson eyes
  with a handkerchief already saturated with liquid woe.</p>

  <p>"It's a relief to know it wasn't you," said Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure&mdash;it's kind of you&mdash;to say so," snuffled
  Olivetta gratefully.</p>

  <p>"But, aside from your being safe, our situation is unchanged,"
  said Mrs. De Peyster in tremulous, awe-stricken tone. "For
  that&mdash;that person is coming here just the same!"</p>

  <p>"I know. The horrid interloper!"</p>

  <p>"She may be here any minute," said Mrs. De Peyster. "What are
  we going to do?"</p>

  <p>"We must think of something quick," spoke up <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg 257]</span>
  Matilda nervously. "For it's almost time for your funeral, ma'am,
  and after that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking all the voyage over," broke in Olivetta.
  "And I could think of only one plan."</p>

  <p>"And that?" Mrs. De Peyster eagerly inquired.</p>

  <p>There was an excited, desperate light in Olivetta's flooding
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you manage, in some way, while nobody is looking, to
  slip into that Frenchwoman's place; and then, before the ceremony
  was over, you could sit up and say you'd been in a cataleptic
  fit. Such things have happened. I've read about them."</p>

  <p>"Absurd, Olivetta! Quite absurd!" quavered Mrs. De
  Peyster.</p>

  <p>"I dare say it is," agreed Olivetta, subsiding again into her
  limp misery. "Oh, why did I ever go to Paris! I hate the
  place!"</p>

  <p>"Don't give way; think!" commanded Mrs. De Peyster, who was in
  a condition not far removed from Olivetta's. "Think,
  Matilda!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am," said Matilda obediently.</p>

  <p>"You think, Caroline," whimpered Olivetta. "You always had
  such a superior intellect, and were always so equal to every
  emergency."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster thus reminded of what was expected of her
  life-long leadership, tried to collect her scattered forces, and
  sat with pale, drawn, twitching face, staring at her
  predicament&mdash;and her two faithful subjects sat staring at
  her, waiting the inspired idea for escape that would fall from
  her <span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg
  258]</span> never-failing lips. Moment after moment of deepest
  silence followed.</p>

  <p>At length Mrs. De Peyster spoke.</p>

  <p>"There are only two ways. First, for me to go down and
  disclose myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But the scandal! The humiliation!" cried Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that first way will never do," said Mrs. De Peyster.
  "The second way is not a solution; it is only a means to a
  possible solution. But before I state the way, I must ask you,
  Olivetta, if any one saw you come in?"</p>

  <p>"There were a number of people coming and going, people
  preparing for the funeral&mdash;but I watched my chance, and used
  my latch-key, and I'm sure no one connected with the house saw
  me."</p>

  <p>"That is good. If any outsiders saw you, they will merely
  believe that you also were some person concerned in the funeral.
  As for my plan, it is simple. You must both slip out of here
  unseen; you, Olivetta, will, of course, say that you have
  returned to the city to attend my funeral. From the outside you
  both must help me."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But you, Caroline?" said Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"As for me, I must stay here, quietly, just as I have done for
  the last three weeks. I still have some supplies left. After
  everything has quieted down, I shall watch my chance, and steal
  out of the house late some night. That's as far as I have
  planned, but once away I can work out some explanation for
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg
  259]</span> the terrible mistake and then come home. That seems
  the only way; that seems the only chance."</p>

  <p>"You always were a wonder!" cried Olivetta admiringly.</p>

  <p>"Then you agree to the plan?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p>

  <p>"And you, Matilda?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, ma'am."</p>

  <p>Thus praised and seconded, Mrs. De Peyster resumed some faint
  shadow of her accustomed dignity.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. You must both leave here this instant."</p>

  <p>Olivetta threw her arms about her cousin's neck.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Caroline," she quavered. "You really have no hard
  feelings against me?"</p>

  <p>"No, none. You must go!" said Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure, with you in charge, it's all going to come out
  right!" said the clinging Olivetta hopefully.</p>

  <p>"You must really go!" And Mrs. De Peyster pressed her and
  Matilda toward the door.</p>

  <p>But midway to the door the trio halted suddenly. Coming up the
  stairway was the sound of hurried feet&mdash;of many pairs of
  feet. The footsteps came through the hall. The trio did not
  breathe. The footsteps paused before the sitting-room door. The
  confederates gripped each others' arms.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you saw that person come in here?" they heard a
  voice ask&mdash;Jack's voice.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page260" id="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span>

  <p>"I'm certain." The voice that answered was Mary's.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet it was a sneak thief," said a third voice&mdash;Mr.
  Pyecroft's. "To slip into a house at a funeral, or a wedding,
  when a lot of people are coming and going&mdash;that's one of
  their oldest tricks." He turned the knob, and finding the door
  locked, shook it violently. "Open up, in there!" he called.</p>

  <p>The three clung to one another for support.</p>

  <p>"Better open up!" called a fourth voice&mdash;Judge Harvey's.
  "For we know you're in there!"</p>

  <p>Breathless, the trembling conspirators clung yet more
  desperately.</p>

  <p>"But how could she get in?" queried the excited voice of Mary.
  "I understood that Mrs. De Peyster locked the door before she
  went away."</p>

  <p>"Skeleton key," was Mr. Pyecroft's brief explanation. "Mrs. De
  Peyster, we three will watch the door to see she doesn't get
  out&mdash;there may have been more than one of her. You go and
  telephone for a locksmith and the police."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Mary.</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;it's all over!" breathed Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Oh, oh! What shall we ever do?" wailed Olivetta, collapsing
  into a chair.</p>

  <p>"The police!&mdash;she mustn't go!" gasped Mrs. De Peyster.
  "Open the door, Matilda, quick!" Then in a weak, quavering voice
  she called to her besiegers:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id=
  "page261"></a>[pg 261]</span>

  <p>After which she wilted away into the nearest chair&mdash;which
  chanced to be directly beneath the awesome, unbending,
  blue-blue-blooded Mrs. De Peyster of the golden frame, whose
  proud composure it was beyond things mortal to
  disturb.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id=
  "page262"></a>[pg 262]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <h3>A FAMILY REUNION</h3>

  <p>Matilda's shaking hand unlocked the door. Jack lunged in,
  behind him Mr. Pyecroft and Judge Harvey, and behind them Mary.
  On Jack's face was a look of menacing justice. But at sight of
  the trembling turnkey the invading party suddenly halted, and
  Jack's stern jaw relaxed and almost dropped from its sockets.</p>

  <p>"Matilda!" he exclaimed. And from behind him, like a
  triplicate echo, sounded the others' "Matilda!"</p>

  <p>"Good&mdash;good-morning, Mr. Jack," quavered Matilda, locking
  the door again.</p>

  <p>Then the four sighted Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"What, you, Olivetta!" Jack and Judge Harvey cried in
  unison.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's I, Jack," she said with an hysterical laugh. "I
  just thought I'd call in to express&mdash;it's no more than is
  proper, my being her cousin, you know,&mdash;to express my
  sympathy to your mother."</p>

  <p>"Your sympathy to my mother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. To&mdash;to tell her how&mdash;how sorry I am that she's
  dead," elucidated Olivetta.</p>

  <p>A little hand gripped Jack's arm.</p>

  <p>"Jack!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id=
  "page263"></a>[pg 263]</span>

  <p>He turned his head and his eyes followed Mary's pointing
  finger.</p>

  <p>"Mother!" He walked amazedly up before Mrs. De Peyster's
  palsied figure. "Mother!"</p>

  <p>In the same instant Judge Harvey was beside her.</p>

  <p>"Caroline!" he breathed, like one seeing a ghost.</p>

  <p>"Ye-yes," she mumbled.</p>

  <p>"Then you're not dead?"</p>

  <p>"N-no," she mumbled.</p>

  <p>The Judge and Jack and Mary gazed down at her in uttermost
  astoundment. To them was added Mr. Pyecroft. His bewilderment,
  for the moment, was the greatest of the group; for the likeness
  between the black-garbed, fled Angelica, and this real Mrs. De
  Peyster in lavender dressing-gown, was more remarkable than he
  had ever dreamed.</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" quavered Judge Harvey. And then, voicing the
  general amazement: "But&mdash;but&mdash;I don't understand! What
  has happened? How do you come here?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster, with a shivering glance at them all, and one
  of particular terror at her recent confederate, Mr. Pyecroft,
  made a last rally to save herself.</p>

  <p>"My explanation&mdash;that is, all I know about this
  affair&mdash;is really very simple. I&mdash;you see&mdash;I very
  unexpectedly returned home&mdash;and&mdash;and discovered
  this&mdash;this situation. That is all." She gathered a little
  more courage. "I do not need to inform you that I have been
  away."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id=
  "page264"></a>[pg 264]</span>

  <p>"Of course, we know you've been away!" said Jack. "But that
  Mrs. De Peyster at the pier&mdash;who is she?"</p>

  <p>"She's nothing&mdash;but a base&mdash;impostor!" cried
  Olivetta indignantly, lifting her face for a moment from her
  woe-soaked handkerchief. "Don't you believe a word she says!"</p>

  <p>"But we're all ready for the ceremony!" exclaimed Jack. "There
  are a dozen reporters downstairs, and no end of friends are
  coming from out of town to be present. And that person, whoever
  she is, will be here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I tell you she's an impostor!" cried Olivetta frantically.
  "Don't you let her in!"</p>

  <p>"Caroline, I can't tell you how&mdash;" Judge Harvey's voice,
  tremulous with relief at this unbelievably averted tragedy, broke
  off. "But what are we going to do?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, what are we going to do?" echoed Mary.</p>

  <p>Concern over this new, swiftly approaching crisis for a moment
  took precedence of all other emotions. Judge Harvey and Mary and
  Jack gazed at each other, bewildered, helpless. Something had to
  be done, quick&mdash;but what?</p>

  <p>"I tell you, don't let that impostor in!" repeated the frantic
  Olivetta.</p>

  <p>The three continued their interchange of helpless gaze.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me if I seem to intrude," spoke up the even voice of
  Mr. Pyecroft.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id=
  "page265"></a>[pg 265]</span>

  <p>Swiftly, but without appearing to hurry, he stepped to Mrs. De
  Peyster's writing-desk, and began running through the pages of
  the telephone book. With terrified apprehension, Mrs. De Peyster
  watched him: what&mdash;what was that terrible man going to
  do?</p>

  <p>The telephone was now in his hand, the receiver at his
  ear.</p>

  <p>"Central, give me Broad 4900.... Is this the French Line? Then
  connect me with the manager.... This the manager of the French
  Line?... I am speaking for Mr. Jack De Peyster, son of Mrs. De
  Peyster,&mdash;you know. Please give orders to the proper
  authorities to have Mrs. De Peyster held at the dock. Or if she
  has left, stop her at all cost. There must be no mistake! Further
  orders will follow. Understand?... Thank you very much.
  Good-bye."</p>

  <p>He turned about.</p>

  <p>"It will be all right," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>With a wild stare at him, Mrs. De Peyster sank back in her
  chair and closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"She's fainted!" cried Mary. "Her smelling-salts!"</p>

  <p>"A glass of water!" exclaimed Jack.</p>

  <p>"No, no," breathed Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>But the pair had darted away, Mary into the bedroom, Jack into
  the bathroom. From the bathroom came a sudden, jangling din like
  the sheet-iron thunder of the stage.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg 266]</span>

  <p>Mary reappeared, fresh amazement on her face.</p>

  <p>"Somebody's been using the bedroom! The bed's not made, and
  your clothes are all about!"</p>

  <p>The next moment Jack rushed in behind her.</p>

  <p>"What a stack of empty tin cans I kicked into in the bathroom!
  What the deuce has been going on here?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster looked weakly, hopelessly, at Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"There's no use trying to keep it up any longer. We&mdash;we
  might as well confess. You tell them, Olivetta."</p>

  <p>But Olivetta protested into her dripping handkerchief that she
  never, never could. So it fell to Mrs. De Peyster herself to be
  the historian of her plans and misadventures&mdash;and she was so
  far reduced that even the presence of Mr. Pyecroft made no
  difference to her; and as for Mr. Pyecroft, when the truth of the
  affair flashed upon him, that wide, flexible mouth twisted upward
  into its whimsicalest smile&mdash;but the next instant his face
  was gravity itself. With every word she grew less and less like
  the Mrs. De Peyster of M. Dubois's masterpiece. At the close of
  the long narrative, made longer by frequent outbursts of misery,
  she could have posed for a masterpiece of humiliation.</p>

  <p>"It's all been bad enough," she moaned at the end; "what's
  happened is all bad enough, but think what's yet to come! It's
  all coming out! Everybody will be laughing at
  me&mdash;oh!&mdash;oh!&mdash;oh!&mdash;"</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg 267]</span>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster was drifting away into inarticulate
  lamentations, when there came a tramping sound upon the stairway.
  She drew herself up.</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>There was a loud rap upon the door.</p>

  <p>"I say, Judge Harvey, Mr. De Peyster," called out a voice.
  "What's all this delay about?"</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" breathed Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"That infernal Mayfair, and the whole gang of reporters!"
  exclaimed Jack.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jack,&mdash;Judge Harvey! Save me! Save me!"</p>

  <p>"The hour set for the funeral is passed," Mayfair continued to
  call, "the drawing-room is packed with people, and the body
  hasn't arrived yet. We don't want to make ourselves obnoxious,
  but it's almost press-time for the next edition, and we've got to
  know what's doing. You know what a big story this is.
  Understand&mdash;we've simply got to know!"</p>

  <p>"Judge&mdash;what the devil <i>are</i> we going to do?"
  breathed Jack.</p>

  <p>"My God, Caroline, Jack,&mdash;this is awful!" Judge Harvey
  whispered desperately. "We simply can't keep this out of the
  papers, and when it does get out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh! Oh!" moaned Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"Judge Harvey," called the impatient Mr. Mayfair, "you really
  must tell us what's up!"</p>

  <p>Judge Harvey and Jack and Mary regarded each <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg 268]</span>
  other in blank desperation; Mrs. De Peyster and Olivetta and
  Matilda were merely different varieties of jellied
  helplessness.</p>

  <p>"Judge Harvey," Mr. Mayfair called again, "we simply must
  insist!"</p>

  <p>"Caroline," falteringly whispered Judge Harvey, "I don't see
  what we&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," whispered Mr. Pyecroft, gently stepping forward
  among them. Then he raised his voice: "Wait just one minute,
  gentlemen! You shall know everything!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Pyecroft, don't, don't!" moaned Mrs. De Peyster.
  "Judge Harvey&mdash;Jack&mdash;don't let him! Send them away! Put
  it off! I can't stand it!"</p>

  <p>But Mr. Pyecroft, without heeding her protest, and unhampered
  by the others, stepped to Olivetta's side.</p>

  <p>"Miss Harmon," he whispered rapidly, "did you obey Mrs. De
  Peyster's instructions on your voyage home? About keeping to your
  stateroom&mdash;about keeping yourself veiled, and all the
  rest?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Olivetta.</p>

  <p>"And Mrs. De Peyster's trunks, where are they?"</p>

  <p>"At the Cunard pier,"</p>

  <p>"What name did you sail under?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Harriman."</p>

  <p>In the same instant Mr. Pyecroft had lifted Olivetta to her
  feet, had drawn from her boneless figure the long traveling-coat
  of pongee silk, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id=
  "page269"></a>[pg 269]</span> had drawn the pins from her
  traveling-hat. Released from his support, Olivetta re-collapsed.
  In the next instant Mr. Pyecroft had Mrs. De Peyster upon her
  feet, with firm, deft, resistless hands had slipped the long coat
  upon her, had put the hat upon her head and pushed in the pins,
  had drawn the thick veil down over her face&mdash;and had thrust
  her again down into her chair.</p>

  <p>"Matilda, not a word!" he ordered, in a quick, authoritative
  whisper. "Miss Harmon, not a word! Mrs. De Peyster, call up your
  nerve; you'll need it, for you know that Mayfair is the cleverest
  reporter in Park Row. And now, Mrs. Jack De Peyster,"&mdash;for
  Mary stood nearest the door,&mdash;"let them in."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster half-rose in ultimate consternation.</p>

  <p>"Oh, please&mdash;please&mdash;you're not going to let them
  in!"</p>

  <p>"We don't dare keep them out!" Mr. Pyecroft pressed Mrs. De
  Peyster firmly back into her chair. "Keep your nerve!" he
  repeated sharply. "Open the door, please,&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>Mary cast a questioning glance at Jack, who, bewildered,
  nodded his consent. She unlocked the door.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg 270]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <h3>MR. PYECROFT TAKES CHARGE</h3>

  <p>The next moment a dozen reporters crowded into the room, the
  redoubtable Mr. Mayfair at their head; and behind them could be
  seen the pale, curious faces of William, Miss Gardner, and M.
  Dubois. Mrs. De Peyster, Olivetta, and Matilda sat in limp
  despair. Judge Harvey, Jack, and Mary gazed in breathless
  suspense and wonderment at Mr. Pyecroft. As for Mr. Pyecroft, he
  stood before Mrs. De Peyster, obscuring her, looking like one who
  has suffered a severe shock, yet withal grave and composed.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" demanded the keen-faced Mayfair.</p>

  <p>"Before I answer that," said Mr. Pyecroft, "permit me to
  preface what I have to say by touching upon two necessary
  personal details. First, I believe, at least, you, Mr. Mayfair,
  have known me as Mr. Simpson, brother of Mrs. De Peyster's
  housekeeper. I am not her brother. This harmless deception was
  undertaken, for reasons not necessary to give, at the request of
  Judge Harvey; he wished me to remain in the house to arrange, and
  make abstracts of, certain private papers. The <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg 271]</span>
  second detail is, that I am speaking at the request of Judge
  Harvey, as his associate and as the representative of the De
  Peyster family."</p>

  <p>Judge Harvey felt his collar; Jack stared. But fortunately the
  room was dim, and the reporters' eyes were all on the grave,
  candid face of Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;yes," said the impatient Mayfair. "But out with the
  story! What's doing?"</p>

  <p>"Something that I think will surprise you," said Mr. Pyecroft.
  "Something that has completely astounded all of
  us&mdash;particularly this lady who is Mrs. De Peyster's
  housekeeper, and Miss Harmon, here, who has just returned from a
  quiet summer in Maine to attend her cousin's funeral. The fact
  is, gentlemen, to come right to the point, there is to be no
  funeral."</p>

  <p>"No funeral!" cried Mr. Mayfair.</p>

  <p>"No funeral!" ran through the crowd.</p>

  <p>"No funeral," repeated Mr. Pyecroft. "The reason, gentlemen,
  is that a great mistake has been made. Mrs. De Peyster is not
  dead."</p>

  <p>"Not dead!" exclaimed the reporters.</p>

  <p>"If you desire proof, here it is." Mr. Pyecroft, stepping
  aside, revealed the figure of Mrs. De Peyster. He put his right
  hand upon her shoulder, gripping it tightly and holding her in
  her chair, and with his left he lifted the thick veil above her
  face. "I believe that most of you know Mrs. De Peyster, at least
  from her pictures."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"
  id="page272"></a>[pg 272]</span>

  <p>"Mrs. De Peyster!" cried the staggered crowd. "Mrs. De Peyster
  herself!"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. De Peyster herself," repeated Mr. Pyecroft in his grave
  voice. "You are surprised, but not more so than the rest of
  us."</p>

  <p>"But that other Mrs. De Peyster&mdash;the one the funeral is
  for?" asked Mr. Mayfair. "Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"That, gentlemen, is as great a mystery to us as to any of
  you," said Mr. Pyecroft.</p>

  <p>"But how the&mdash;but how did it all happen?" ejaculated Mr.
  Mayfair.</p>

  <p>"That is what I am going to tell you," Mr. Pyecroft
  answered.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster struggled up.</p>

  <p>"Don't&mdash;don't!" she besought him wildly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pyecroft pressed her back into her chair, and held her
  there with an arm that was like a brace of steel.</p>

  <p>"You see, gentlemen," he remarked sympathetically, "how this
  business has upset her."</p>

  <p>"Yes! But the explanation?"</p>

  <p>"Immediately&mdash;word for word, as Mrs. De Peyster has just
  now told us," said he.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" moaned Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>Olivetta and Matilda gazed at Mr. Pyecroft with ghastly,
  loose-lipped faces; Judge Harvey and Jack and Mary stared at him
  with an amazed suspense which they could hardly mask; and Miss
  Gardner, with whom he had not yet made his peace, breathlessly
  awaited the next move of this incomprehensible <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span>
  husband of hers. Mr. Pyecroft kept his eyes, for the most part,
  upon the shrewd, fraud-penetrating features of the unfoilable Mr.
  Mayfair&mdash;his own countenance the most truthful that son of
  Adam ever wore.</p>

  <p>"What Mrs. De Peyster has said is really very simple. As you
  know, she left Paris two or three weeks ago on a long motor trip.
  During her brief stay in Paris, one of her trunks was either lost
  or stolen, she is not certain which. As she pays no personal
  attention to her baggage, she was not aware of her loss for
  several days. So much is fact. Now we come to mere conjecture. A
  plausible conjecture seems to be that the gowns in the trunk were
  sold to a second-hand dealer, and these gowns, being attractive,
  the dealer must have immediately resold to various purchasers,
  and one of these purchasers must have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! Plain as day!" exclaimed Mr. Mayfair.</p>

  <p>"The face was unrecognizable," continued Mr. Pyecroft, "but
  since the gown had sewn into it Mrs. De Peyster's name, of
  course&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course! The most natural mistake in the world!" cried Mr.
  Mayfair excitedly. "Go on! Go on!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster had slowly turned a dazed countenance upward
  and was gazing at the sober, plausible face of her young man of
  the sea.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. De Peyster did not learn of what had <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg 274]</span>
  happened till the day the supposed Mrs. De Peyster was started
  homeward. The most sensible thing for her to have done would have
  been to declare the mistake, and saved her family and friends a
  great deal of grief. But the shock completely unbalanced her. I
  will not attempt to describe her psychological processes or
  explain her actions. You may call her course illogical,
  hysterical, what you like; I do not seek to defend it; I am only
  trying to give you the facts. She was so completely
  unnerved&mdash;But a mere look at Mrs. De Peyster will show you
  how the shock unnerved her."</p>

  <p>The group gazed at Mrs. De Peyster's face. A murmur of
  sympathy and understanding ran among them.</p>

  <p>"In her hysterical condition," continued Mr. Pyecroft, "she
  had but one thought, and that was to get home as quickly as she
  could. She crossed to England, sailed on the Mauretania, kept to
  her stateroom, and arrived here at the house heavily veiled about
  an hour ago. I may add the details that she sailed under the name
  of Miss Harriman and that her trunks are now at the Cunard pier.
  There you have the entire story, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>He looked down at Mrs. De Peyster. "I believe I have stated
  the matter just as you outlined it to us?"</p>

  <p>"Ye&mdash;yes," breathed Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>"There is no detail you would like to add?"</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;none," breathed Mrs. De Peyster.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg 275]</span>

  <p>"Then, gentlemen," said Mr. Pyecroft, turning to the
  reporters, "since you have all the facts, and since Mrs. De
  Peyster is in a state bordering on collapse, we would take it as
  a favor if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No need to dismiss us," put in Mr. Mayfair. "We're in a
  bigger hurry to leave than you are to have us go. God, boys," he
  ejaculated to his fellows, "what a peach of a story!"</p>

  <p>In a twinkling Mr. Mayfair and his fellows of the press had
  vanished, each in the direction of a telephone over which he
  could hurry this super-sensation into his office.</p>

  <p>Within the room, all were staring at Mr. Pyecroft, as though
  in each a whirling chaos were striving to shape itself into
  speech. But before they could become articulate, that sober young
  gentleman had stepped from out of their midst and, his back to
  them, was discreetly engrossing himself in the examination of the
  first object that came to his hands: which chanced to be
  something lying on top of the exquisite safe&mdash;a slender
  platinum chain with a pendant pearl.</p>

  <p>With him gone, all eyes fixed themselves upon Mrs. De Peyster,
  and there was a profound and motionless silence in the room, save
  at first for some very sincere and vigorous snuffling into the
  handkerchiefs of Olivetta and Matilda. As for Mrs. De Peyster,
  she sat below the awesome, imperturbable Mrs. De Peyster of the
  portrait, and oh, what a change was there in the one
  beneath!&mdash;huddled, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page276"
  id="page276"></a>[pg 276]</span> shaking, not a duchess-like line
  to her person, her face dropped forward in her hands.</p>

  <p>"Mother&mdash;" Jack breathed at length.</p>

  <p>"Caroline!" breathed Judge Harvey. Then added: "I'm sure
  it&mdash;it'll never become known."</p>

  <p>"Oh, to think it's all over&mdash;and we're out of it!"
  Olivetta cried hysterically. "Oh! Oh!" And she limply pitched
  sidewise in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Mees Harmon&mdash;Olivetta!" exclaimed M. Dubois. He sprang
  forward, knelt at her side and supported her wilted figure
  against his bosom. Upon this poultice to her troubles Olivetta
  relaxed and sobbed unrestrainedly. And no one, particularly Mrs.
  De Peyster, paid the least heed to this little episode.</p>

  <p>William, the coachman, the irreproachable, irreplaceable,
  unbendable William, his clean-shaven mask of a face now somewhat
  pale&mdash;William took a few respectful paces toward his
  resurrected mistress.</p>

  <p>"If you will not regard it as a liberty," said he, with his
  cadence of a prime minister, "I should like to express my relief
  and happiness at your restoration among us."</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;William," whispered Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>William, having delivered his felicitations, bowed slightly,
  and started to turn away. But Matilda had stepped forward behind
  him, an imploring look upon her face.</p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span>

  <p>"Please, ma'am,&mdash;please, ma'am!" said she, in a tone that
  left no doubt as to her meaning.</p>

  <p>"Wait, William," weakly commanded Mrs. De Peyster.</p>

  <p>William paused.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster did not yet know what she was doing; her words
  spoke themselves.</p>

  <p>"William, Matilda has&mdash;has just confessed your
  engagement. She has also confessed how, during my&mdash;my
  absence&mdash;one night, after driving with you, she&mdash;she
  lost control of herself and seriously offended you. She asks me
  to apologize to you and tell you how very, very sorry she
  is."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I am, William!" put in Matilda fervently.</p>

  <p>"It is my wish, William," continued Mrs. De Peyster, "that you
  should forgive her&mdash;and make up things between you&mdash;and
  never speak of that incident again&mdash;and be happy and stay
  with me forever."</p>

  <p>Matilda timidly slipped an arm through William's.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, William!" said she appealingly.</p>

  <p>William's graven face exhibited a strange phenomenon&mdash;it
  twitched slightly.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mrs. De Peyster," said he. And bowing
  respectfully, with Matilda upon his arm, he went out.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mary, I guess we'd better be going, too," said Jack,
  taking his wife's hand. "Mother,"&mdash;respectfully, yet a
  little defiantly,&mdash;"I'm sorry <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page278" id="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span> that Mary and I have
  by our trespassing caused you so much inconvenience. But Mary and
  I and our things will be out of the house within an hour.
  Good-bye."</p>

  <p>"Wait, Jack!" Mrs. De Peyster reached up a trembling hand and
  caught his sleeve. "Olivetta," said she, "perhaps you and
  your&mdash;your fianc&amp;#233; could find&mdash;another place
  for your confidences."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Olivetta, starting up with a flush.</p>

  <p>"Cousin Caroline, do you mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster lifted an interrupting hand.</p>

  <p>"Do as you like, but tell me about it later."</p>

  <p>As the pair went out, Mrs. De Peyster slowly raised herself up
  and stood gazing for a moment at her son. And that strange new
  force which had menaced her with eruption during all the days of
  her hiding, and which these last few minutes had been pulsing
  upward toward orgasm, was now become resistless. It was as though
  a crust, a shell, were being burst and being violently shed. She
  thrilled with an amazing, undreamed-of, expanding warmth.</p>

  <p>"Do you really&mdash;want to&mdash;leave me, Jack?" she
  whispered.</p>

  <p>"I have been invited to leave," said he, "but I have never
  been invited to come back."</p>

  <p>With a timidity, shot through with tingling daring, she
  slipped an arm about his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Then I invite you," she said tremulously. "Won't you stay,
  Jack?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id=
  "page279"></a>[pg 279]</span>

  <p>"And Mary?" said he.</p>

  <p>She looked about at her dark-eyed daughter-in-law.</p>

  <p>"If Mary will stay, too, I'll&mdash;I'll try not to act like
  my petrified family tree."</p>

  <p>"What! Was that you that day?" gasped the horrified Mary.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Peyster slipped her other arm about Mary, and daringly
  she kissed Mary's fresh young cheek, and she drew the two
  tightly, almost convulsively, to her. "Mother!" cried Jack; and
  the next instant the two pairs of arms were about her. And thus
  they stood for several moments; until&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Caroline," broke in the unsteady but determined voice of
  Judge Harvey, "I told you I was going to propose to you again.
  And I'm going to do it right now. Please consider yourself
  proposed to."</p>

  <p>She looked up&mdash;shamefaced, flushing.</p>

  <p>"What, after the foolish woman I've&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you were ever foolish, you were never less a fool than
  now!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," she quavered, "but anyhow I want
  you to straighten out my affairs&mdash;and&mdash;and Allistair,
  for all I care, can have&mdash;can have&mdash;for I'm all
  through&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Caroline!"</p>

  <p>The next moment Judge Harvey's arms had usurped complete
  possession of her. And she wilted away upon his shoulder, and
  sobbed there. And thus for several moments....</p>

  <p>They were aroused by a polite cough. Both <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span>
  looked up. Halfway to the door stood Mr. Pyecroft; and beside him
  was Miss Gardner, gazing at him, tremulously bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," said he, in his grave manner; nothing was ever
  seen less suggestive of having ever smiled than his
  face&mdash;"pardon me, Judge Harvey, but I believe you failed to
  mention at what time your office opens."</p>

  <p>"What time my office opens?" Judge Harvey repeated blankly.
  "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Mr. Pyecroft, "I wish to know at what hour I
  am supposed to report for work."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;Well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But for a moment Judge Harvey could get out no more. He just
  stared.</p>

  <p>Then in a voice of dryest sarcasm: "Would you consider it
  impudent on my part&mdash;I wouldn't be impudent for the world,
  you know&mdash;to inquire what might be your real name? I have
  heard you variously called Mr. Simpson, Mr. Preston, Mr.
  Pyecroft. Perhaps you have a few other <i>aliases</i>."</p>

  <p>"I have had&mdash;yes. My real name is Eliot Endicott
  Bradford. That name has the advantage of never having appeared in
  any complaint or police report. For that matter, I may add that
  under none of my names have I ever been arrested. Eliot Bradford
  is a man against whom no legal fault can be found."</p>

  <p>"A testimonial from you," exclaimed the Judge&mdash;"what
  could possibly be better!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page281" id="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span>

  <p>"But the hour?" gently insisted the other.</p>

  <p>Judge Harvey stared; his eyes narrowed. Then,
  suddenly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Nine-thirty," said he.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," said Mr. Bradford; and slipped a hand
  through Miss Gardner's arm.</p>

  <p>But before he could turn to go, Mrs. De Peyster, from over the
  shoulder against which she leaned&mdash;Mrs. De Peyster, she
  couldn't help it ... smiled at him.</p>

  <p>And, suddenly, Judge Harvey&mdash;he couldn't help it, either
  ... was smiling, too.</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
