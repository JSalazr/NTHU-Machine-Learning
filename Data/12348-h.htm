<br>
<p>I never knew exactly how the invitation came; I felt very much
honored by it, though I think now, very likely the honor was felt
to be upon the other side. I was exceedingly young, and exceedingly
ignorant, not seventeen, and an orphan, living in the house of an
uncle, an unmarried man of nearly seventy, wholly absorbed in
business, and not much more interested in me than in his clerks and
servants.</p>
<p>I had come under his protection, a little girl of two years old,
and had been in his house ever since. I had had as good care as a
very ordinary class of servants could give me, and was supplied
with some one to teach me, and had as much money to spend as was
good for me--perhaps more; and I do not feel inclined to say my
uncle did not do his duty, for I do not think he knew of anything
further to do; and strictly speaking, I had no claim on him, for I
was only a great-niece, and there were those living who were more
nearly related to me, and who were abundantly able to provide for
me, if they had been willing to do it.</p>
<p>When I came in to the household, its wants were attended to by a
cook and a man-servant, who had lived many years with my uncle. A
third person was employed as my nurse, and a great deal of
quarrelling was the result of her coming. I quite wonder my uncle
did not put me away at board somewhere, rather than be disturbed.
But in truth, I do not believe that the quarrelling disturbed him
much, or that he paid much attention to the matter, and so the
matter settled itself. My nurses were changed very often, by will
of the cook and old Peter, and I never was happy enough to have one
who had very high principle, or was more than ordinarily
good-tempered.</p>
<p>I don't know who selected my teachers; probably they applied for
employment and were received. They were very business-like and
unsuggestive people. I was of no more interest to them than a bale
of goods, I believe. Indeed, I seemed likely to go a bale of goods
through life; everything that was done for me was done for money,
and with a view to the benefit of the person serving me. I was not
sent to school, which was a very great pity; it was owing to the
fact, no doubt, that somebody applied to my uncle to teach me at
home, and so the system was inaugurated, and never received a
second thought, and I went on being taught at home till I was
seventeen.</p>
<p>The "home" was as follows; a large dark house on the unsunny
side of a dull street; furniture that had not been changed for
forty years, walls that were seldom repainted, windows that were
rarely opened. The neighborhood had been for many years
unfashionable and undesirable, and, by the time I was grown up,
nobody would have lived in it, who had cared to have a cheerful
home, I might almost have said, a respectable one, I fancy ours was
nearly the only house in the block occupied by its owner; the
others, equally large, were rented for tenement houses, or
boarding-houses, and perhaps for many things worse. It was probably
owing to this fact, that my uncle gave orders, once for all, I was
never to go into the street alone; and I believe, in my whole life,
I had never taken a walk unaccompanied by a servant, or one of my
teachers.</p>
<p>A very dull life indeed. I wonder how I endured it. The rooms
were so dismal, the windows so uneventful. If it had not been for a
room in the garret where I had my playthings, and where the sun
came all day long, I am sure I should have been a much worse and
more unhappy child. As I grew older, I tried to adorn my room (my
own respectable sleeping room, I mean), with engravings, and the
little ornaments that I could buy. But it was a hopeless attempt.
The walls were so high and so dingy, the little pictures were lost
upon them; and the vases on the great black mantel-shelf looked so
insignificant, I felt ashamed of them, and owned the unfitness of
decorating such a room. No flowers would grow in those cold north
windows--no bird would sing in sight of such a street. I gave it up
with a sigh; and there was one good instinct lost.</p>
<p>When I was about eleven, I fell foul of some good books. If it
had not been for them, I truly do not see how I could have known
that I was not to lie or steal, and that God was to be worshipped.
Certainly, I had had hands slapped many times for taking things I
had been forbidden to touch, and had had many a battle in
consequence of "telling stories," with the servants of the house,
but I had always recognized the personal spite of the punishments,
and they had not carried with them any moral lesson.</p>
<p>I had sometimes gone to church; but the sermons in large city
churches are not generally elementary, and I did not understand
those that I heard at all. Occasionally I went with the nurse to
Vespers, and that I thought delightful. I was enraptured with the
pictures, the music, the rich clothes of the priests; if it had not
been for the bad odor of the neighboring worshippers, I think I
might have rushed into the bosom of the Church of Rome. But that
offended sense restrained me. And so, as I said, if I had not
obtained access to some books of holy and pure influence, and been
starved by the dullness of the life around me into taking hold of
them with eagerness, I should have led the life of a little heathen
in the midst of light. Of course the books were not written for my
especial case, nor were they books for children,--and so, much was
supposed, and not expressed, and consequently the truth they
imparted to me was but fragmentary. But it was truth, and the
influence was holy.</p>
<p>I was driven to books; I do not believe I had any more desire
than most vivid, palpitating, fluttering young things of my sex, to
pore over a dull black and white page; but this black and white
gate opened to me golden fields of happiness, while I was perishing
of hunger in a life of dreary fact.</p>
<p>When I was about sixteen, however, an outside human influence,
not written in black and white, came into the current of my
existence. About that time, my uncle took into his firm, as junior
partner, a young man who had long been a clerk in the house. After
his promotion he often came home with my uncle to dinner. I think
this was done, perhaps, with a view of civil treatment, on the
first occasion; but afterward, it was continued because my uncle
could not bear to leave business when he left the office, and
because he could talk on the matters which were dearer to him than
his dinner, with this junior, in whom he took unqualified delight.
He often wrote letters in the evening, which my uncle dictated, and
he sometimes did not go away till eleven o'clock at night. The
first time he came, I did not notice him very much. It was not
unusual for Uncle Leonard to be accompanied by some gentleman who
talked business with him during dinner; and being naturally shy,
and moreover, on this occasion, in the middle of a very interesting
book, at once timid and indifferent, I slipped away from the table
the moment that I could. But upon the third or fourth occasion of
his being there, I became interested, finding often a pair of
handsome eyes fixed on me, and being occasionally addressed and
made a partner in the conversation. Uncle Leonard very rarely
talked to me, and I think found me in the way when Richard
Vandermarck made the talk extend to me.</p>
<p>But this was the beginning of a very much improved era for me. I
lost my shyness, and my fear of Uncle Leonard, and indeed, I think,
my frantic thirst for books, and became quite a young lady. We were
great friends; he brought me books, he told me about other people,
he opened a thousand doors of interest and pleasure to me. I never
can enumerate all I owed to him. My dull life was changed, and the
house owed him gratitude.</p>
<p>We began to have the gas lighted in the parlor, and even Uncle
Leonard came in there sometimes and sat after dinner, before he
went up into that dreary library above. I think he rather enjoyed
hearing us talk gayly across his sombre board; he certainly became
softer and more human toward me after Richard came to be so
constantly a guest. He gave me more money to spend, (that was
always the expression of his feelings, his language, so to speak;)
he made various inquiries and improvements about the house. The
dinners themselves were improved, for a horrible monotony had crept
into the soups and sauces of forty years; and Uncle Leonard was no
epicure; he seemed to have no more stomach than he had heart; brain
and pocket made the man.</p>
<p>I think unconsciously he was much influenced by Richard, whose
business talent had charmed him, and to whom he looked for much
that he knew he must soon lose. He was glad to make the house seem
pleasant to him, and he was much gratified by his frequent coming.
And Richard was peculiarly a man to like and to lean upon. Not in
any way brilliant, and with no literary tastes, he was well
educated enough, and very well informed; a thorough business man. I
think he was ordinarily reserved, but our intercourse had been so
unconventional, that I did not think him so at all. He was rather
good-looking, tall and square-shouldered, with light-brown hair and
fine dark-blue eyes; he had a great many points of advantage.</p>
<p>One day, long after he had become almost a member of the
household, he told me he wanted me to know his sister, and that she
would come the next day to see me, if I would like it. I did like
it, and waited for her with impatience. He had told me a great deal
about her, and I was full of curiosity to see her. She was a little
older than Richard, and the only sister; very pretty, and quite a
person of consequence in society. She had made an unfortunate
marriage, though of that Richard said very little to me; but with
better luck than attends most unfortunately-married, women, she was
released by her husband's early death, and was free to be happy
again, with some pretty boys, a moderate fortune, and two brothers
to look after her investments, and do her little errands for her.
She considered herself fortunate; and was a widow of rare
discretion, in that she was wedded to her unexpected independence,
and never intended to be wedded to anything or anybody else. She
was naturally cool and calculating, and was in no danger of being
betrayed by her feelings into any other course of life than the one
she had marked out as most expedient. If she was worldly, she was
also useful, intelligent, and popular, and a paragon in her
brother's partial eyes.</p>

<h3>VERY GOOD LUCK.</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Mieux vaut une once de fortune qu'une livre de
sagesse.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>At last (on the day on which Richard had advertised me she was
coming,) the door was opened, and some one was taken to the parlor.
Then old Peter rang a bell which stood on the hall table, and
called out to Ann Coddle (once my nurse, now the seamstress,
chambermaid, and general lightener of his toils), to tell Miss
Pauline a lady wanted her.</p>
<p>This bell was to save his old bones; he never went up-stairs,
and he resented every visitor as an innovation. They were so few,
his temper was not much tried. I was leaning over the stairs when
the bell rang, and did not need a second message. Ann, who
continued to feel a care for my personal appearance, followed me to
the landing-place and gave my sash a last pull.</p>
<p>When I found myself in the parlor I began to experience a little
embarrassment. Mrs. Hollenbeck was so pretty and her dress was so
dainty, the dingy, stiff, old parlor filled me with dismay.
Fortunately, I did not think much of myself or my own dress. But
after a little, she put me at ease, that is, drew me out and made
me feel like talking to her.</p>
<p>I admired her very much, but I did not feel any of the affection
and quick cordiality with which Richard had inspired me. I could
tell that she was curious about me, and was watching me
attentively, and though she was so charming that I felt flattered
by her interest, I was not pleased when I remembered my interview
with her.</p>
<p>"You are not at all like your brother," I said, glancing in her
face with frankness.</p>
<p>"No?" she said smilingly, and looking attentively at me with an
expression which I did not understand.</p>
<p>And then she drew me on to speak of all his features, which I
did with the utmost candor, showing great knowledge of the
subject.</p>
<p>"And you," she said, "you do not look at all as I supposed. You
are not nearly so young--Richard told me you were quite a child. I
was not prepared for this grace; this young ladyhood--'cette taille
de palmier,'" she added, with a little sweep of the hand.</p>
<p>Somehow I was not pleased to feel that Richard had talked of me
to her, though I liked it that he had talked of her to me. No doubt
she saw it, for I was lamentably transparent. "Do you lead a quiet
life, or have you many friends?" she said, as if she did not know
exactly the kind of life I led, and as if she had not come for the
express purpose of helping me out of it, at the instance of her
kindly brother. Then, of course, I told her all about my dull days,
and she pitied me, and said lightly it must not be, and I must see
more of the world, and she, for her part, must know me better,
etc., etc. And then she went away.</p>
<p>In a few days, I went with Ann Coddle, in a carriage, to return
the visit. The house was small, but in a beautiful, bright street,
and the one window near the door was full of ferns and ivies. I did
not get in, which was a disappointment to me, particularly as I had
no printed card, and realized keenly all the ignominy of leaving
one in writing. This was in April, and I saw no more of my new
friend. Richard was away, on some business of the firm, and the
days were very dull indeed.</p>
<p>In May he came back, and resumed the dinners, and the evenings
in the parlor, though not quite with the frequency of the past
winter,--and I think there was the least shade of constraint in his
manner. It was on one of these May days that he came and took me to
the Park. It was a great occasion; I had never been so happy before
in my life. I was in great doubt about taking Ann Coddle; never
having been out of the house without a person of that description
in attendance before. But Ann got a suspicion of my doubt and
settled it, to go--of course. I think Richard was rather chagrined
when she followed us out to get into the carriage; she was so
dried-up and shrewish-looking, and wore such an Irish bonnet. But
she preserved a discreet silence, and looked steadfastly out of the
carriage window, so we soon forgot that she was there, though she
was directly opposite to us. It was Saturday; the day was fresh and
lovely, and there were crowds of people driving in the Park. Once
we left the carriage with Ann Coddle in it, and went to hear the
music. It was while we were sitting for a few moments under the
vines to listen to it, and watch the gay groups of people around
us, that a carriage passed within a dozen feet, and a lady leaned
out and bowed with smiles.</p>
<p>"Why, see--it is your sister!" I exclaimed, with the vivacity of
a person of a very limited acquaintance.</p>
<p>"Ah," he said, and raised his hat carelessly. But I saw he was
not pleased; he pushed the end of his moustache into his mouth, and
bit it, as he always did when out of humor, and very soon proposed
we should go back and find the carriage. It was not long, however,
before he recovered from this annoyance, as he had from the
unexpected pleasure of Ann's company; and, I am sure, was as sorry
as I when it was time to go home to dinner.</p>
<p>He stayed and dined with us; another gentleman had come home
with my uncle, who talked well and amused us very much. I was
excited and in high spirits; altogether, it was a very happy
day.</p>
<p>It was more than a week after this, that the invitation came
which turned the world upside down at once, and made me most
extravagantly happy. It was from Mrs. Hollenbeck, and I was asked
to spend part of June and all of July and August, with them at
R----.</p>
<p>At R---- was their old family home, a place of very little
pretension, but to which they were much attached. When the father
died, five years before, the two sons had bought the place, or
rather had taken it as their share, turning over the more
productive property to their sister.</p>
<p>They had been very reluctant to close the house, and it was
decided that Sophie should go there every summer, and take her
servants from the city; the expenses of the place being borne by
the two young men. They were very well able to do it, as both were
successful in business, and keeping open the old home, with no
diminution of the hospitality of their father's time, was perhaps
the greatest pleasure that they had. It was an arrangement which
suited Sophie admirably. It gave her the opportunity to entertain
pleasantly and informally; it was a capital summer-home for her two
boys; it was in the centre of an agreeable neighborhood; and above
all, it gave her yearly-exhausted purse time to recuperate and
swell again before the winter's drain. Of course she loved the
place, too, but not with the simple affection that her two brothers
did. The young men invited their friends there without restriction,
as was to be supposed; and Sophie was a gay and agreeable hostess.
No one could have made the house pleasanter than she did; and she
left nothing undone to gratify her brothers' tastes and wishes,
like a wise and prudent woman as she was.</p>
<p>I did not know all this then, or my invitation might not have
overwhelmed me with such gratitude to her. I reproached myself for
not having loved her the first time I saw her.</p>
<p>Three months! Three happy months in the country! I could hardly
believe it possible such a thing had happened to me. I took the
note to my uncle without much fear of his opposition, for he rarely
opposed anything that I had the courage to ask him, except going in
the street alone. (I believe my mother had made a runaway match,
and I think he had faith in inherited traits; his one resolution
regarding me must have been, not to give me a chance.) He read the
note carefully, and then looked me over with more interest than
usual, and told me I might go. Afterward he gave me a roll of
bills, and told me to come to him for more money, if I needed
it.</p>
<p>I was much excited about my clothes. I could not think that
anything was good enough to go to R----; and I am afraid I spent a
good deal of my uncle's money. Ann Coddle and the cook thought that
my dresses were magnificent, and old Peter groaned over the coming
of the packages. I had indeed a wardrobe fit for a young princess,
and in very good taste besides, because I was born with that. An
inheritance, no doubt. And my uncle never complained at all about
the bills. I seemed to have become, in some way, a person of
considerable importance in the house. Ann Coddle no more fretted at
me, but waited on me with alacrity. The cook ceased to bully me,
and on the contrary, flattered me outrageously. I remembered the
long years of bullying, and put no faith in her assurances. I did
not know exactly why this change had happened, but supposed it
might be the result of having become a young lady, and being
invited to pay visits.</p>

<br>
<p>The packages finally ceased coming and the stiff old bell from
being pulled; but only half an hour before the carriage drove to
the door that was to take me to the boat. Ann Coddle was flying up
and down the stairs, and calling messages over to Peter in a shrill
voice. She was not designed by nature for a lady's maid, and was a
very disagreeable person to have about one's room. She made me even
more nervous than I should otherwise have been. I had never packed
a trunk before, or had one packed, and might have thought it a very
simple piece of business if Ann had not made such a mountain of it;
packing every tray half a dozen times over, and going down-stairs
three times about every article that was to come up from the
laundry.</p>
<p>Happily she was not to go with me any farther than the boat.
Richard was away again on business--had been gone, indeed, since
the day after we had driven in the Park: so I was to be put on
board the boat, and left in charge of Kilian, his younger brother,
who had called at my uncle's office, and made the arrangement with
him. I had never seen Kilian, and the meeting filled me with
apprehension; my uncle, however, sent up one of his clerks in the
carriage to take me to the boat, and put me in charge of this young
gentleman. This considerate action on the part of my uncle seemed
to fill up the measure of my surprises.</p>
<p>When we reached the boat, the clerk, a respectful youth,
conducted me to the upper deck, and then left me with Ann, while he
went down about the baggage.</p>
<p>With all our precautions, we were rather late, for the last bell
was ringing; Ann was in a fever of impatience, and I was quite
uncertain what to do, the clerk not having returned, and Mr. Kilian
Vandermarck not having yet appeared. Ann was so disagreeable, and
so disturbing to all thinking, that I had more than once to tell
her to be quiet. Matters seemed to have reached a crisis. The man
at the gangway was shouting "all aboard;" the whistle was blowing;
the bell was ringing; Ann was whimpering; when a belated-looking
young man with a book and paper under his arm came up the stairs
hurriedly and looked around with anxiety. As soon as his eye fell
on us, he looked relieved, and walked directly up to me, and called
me by name, interrogatively.</p>
<p>"O yes," I said eagerly, "but do get this woman off the boat or
we'll have to take her with us." "Oh, no danger," he said, "plenty
of time," and he took her toward the stairs, at the head of which
she was met by the clerk, who touched his hat to me, handed the
checks to Mr. Vandermarck, then hurried off with Ann. Mr.
Vandermarck returned to me, but I was so engrossed looking over the
side of the boat and watching for Ann and the clerk, that I took no
notice of him.</p>
<p>At last I saw Ann scramble on the wharf, just before the plank
was drawn in; with a sigh of relief I turned away.</p>
<p>"I want to apologize for being so late," he said.</p>
<p>"Why, it is not any matter," I answered, "only I had not the
least idea what to do."</p>
<p>"You are not used to travelling alone, then, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Oh no," nor to travelling any way, for the matter of that, I
added to myself; but not aloud, for I had a great fear that it
should be known how very limited my experience was.</p>
<p>"You must let me take your shawl and bag, and we will go and get
a comfortable seat," he said in a few moments. We went forward and
found comfortable chairs under an awning, and where there was a
fine breeze. It was a warm afternoon, and the change from the
heated and glaring wharf was delightful. Mr. Vandermarck threw
himself back in his chair with an expression of relief, and took
off his straw hat.</p>
<p>"If you had been in Wall-street since ten o'clock this morning
you would be prepared to enjoy this sail," he said.</p>
<p>"Is Wall-street so very much more disagreeable than other
places? I think my uncle regrets every moment that he spends away
from it."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. Mr. Greer may; he has a good deal to make him like it;
if I made as much money as he does every day there, I think it's
possible I might like it too. But it is a different matter with a
poor devil like me: if I get off without being cheated out of all
I've got, it is as much as I can ask."</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps when he was your age, Uncle Leonard did not ask
more than that."</p>
<p>"Not he; he began, long before he was as old as I am, to do what
I can never learn to do, Miss d'Esir&eacute;e--make money with one
hand and save it with the other. Now, I'm ashamed to say, a great
deal of money comes into my pockets, but it never stays there long
enough to give me the feeling that I'm a rich man. One gets into a
way of living that's destruction to all chances of a fortune."</p>
<p>"But what's the good of a fortune if you don't enjoy it?" I
said, thinking of the dreary house in Varick-street.</p>
<p>"No good," he said. "It isn't in my nature to be satisfied with
the knowledge that I've got enough to make me happy locked up
somewhere in a safe: I must get it out, and strew it around in
sight in the shape of horses, pictures, nice rooms, and good things
to eat, before I can make up my mind that the money is good for
anything. Now as to Richard, he is just the other way: old head on
young shoulders, old pockets in young breeches (only there ar'nt
any holes in them). He's a model of prudence, is my brother
Richard. <i>Qui garde son diner, il a mieux &agrave; souper</i>.
He'll be a rich man one of these fine days. I look to him to keep
me out of jail. You know Richard very well, I believe?" he said,
turning a sudden look on me, which would have been very
disconcerting to an older person, or one more acquainted with the
world.</p>
<p>"O, very well indeed," I said with great simplicity. "You know
he is such a favorite with my uncle, and he is a great deal at the
house."</p>
<p>"Well he may be a favorite, for he is built exactly on his
model; at seventy, if I am not hung for debt before I reach it, I
shall look to see him just a second Mr. Leonard Greer."</p>
<p>I made a gesture of dissent. "I don't think he is in the least
like Uncle Leonard, and I don't think he cares at all for
money."</p>
<p>"O, Miss Pauline, don't you believe him if he says he doesn't.
I'm his younger brother, whom he has lectured and been hard on for
these twenty-seven years, and I know more about it than anybody
else."</p>
<p>"Why, is Mr. Richard Vandermarck twenty-seven years old?" I said
with much surprise.</p>
<p>"Twenty-nine his next birthday, and I am twenty-seven. Why, did
he pass himself off for younger? That's an excellent thing against
him."</p>
<p>"No; he did not pass himself off for anything in the matter of
age. It was only my idea about him. I thought he was not more than
twenty-five, perhaps even younger than that. But then I had nobody
but Uncle Leonard to compare him with, and it isn't strange that I
didn't get quite right."</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> something of a step from Mr. Greer to Richard, I
must say. Mr. Greer seems so much the oldest man in the world, and
Richard--well, Richard isn't that, but he is a good deal older than
he ought to be. But do you tell me, Miss Pauline, you havn't any
younger fellows than Richard on your cards? Do they keep you as
quiet as all that in Varick-street?"</p>
<p>I knew by intuition this was impertinence, and no doubt I looked
annoyed, and Mr. Vandermarck hastened to obliterate the impression
by a very rapid movement upon the scenery, the beauties of the
river, and many things as novel.</p>
<p>The three hours of our sail passed away pleasantly. Mr.
Vandermarck did not move from his seat; did not even read his
paper, though I gave him an opportunity by turning over the leaves
of my "Littel" on the occurrence of every pause.</p>
<p>I felt that I knew him quite well before the journey was over,
and I liked him exceedingly, almost as well as Richard. He was
rather handsomer than Richard, not so tall, but more vivacious and
more amusing, much more so. I began to think Richard rather dull
when I contrasted him with his brother.</p>
<p>When we reached the wharf, Mr. Vandermarck, after disposing of
the baggage, gave his arm to me, and took me to an open wagon which
was waiting for us. He put me in the seat beside him, and took the
reins with a look of pleasure.</p>
<p>"These are Tom and Jerry, Miss Pauline," he said, "about the
pleasantest members of the family; at least they contribute more to
my pleasure than any other members of it. I squandered about half
my income on them a year or two ago, and have not repented yet;
though, indeed, repentance isn't in my way. I shall hope for the
happiness of giving you many drives with them, if I am
permitted."</p>
<p>"Nothing could make me happier, I am sure."</p>
<p>"Richard hasn't any horses, though he can afford it much better
than I can. He does his driving, when he is here, with the
carriage-horses that we keep for Sophie--a dull old pair of brutes.
He disapproves very much of Tom and Jerry; but you see it would
never do to have two such wise heads in one family."</p>
<p>"It would destroy the balance of power in the neighborhood."</p>
<p>"Decidedly; as it is, we are a first-class power, owing to
Sophie's cleverness and Richard's prudence; my prodigality is just
needed to keep us from overrunning the county and proclaiming an
empire at the next town meeting. How do you like Sophie, Miss
d'Estr&eacute;e? I know you haven't seen much of her--but what you
have? Isn't she clever, and isn't she a pretty woman to be nearly
thirty-five?"</p>
<p>I was feeling very grateful for my invitation, and so I said a
great deal of my admiration for his sister.</p>
<p>"Everybody likes her," he said, complacently. "I don't know a
more popular person anywhere. She is the life of the neighborhood;
people come to her for everything, if they want to get a new
door-mat for the school-house, or if they want a new man nominated
for the legislature. I think she's awfully bored, sometimes, but
she keeps it to herself. But though the summer is her rest, she
always does enough to tire out anybody else. Now, for instance, she
is going to have three young ladies with her for the next two
months (besides yourself, Miss d'Estr&eacute;e), whom she will have
to be amusing all the time, and some friends of mine who will turn
the house inside out. But Sophie never grumbles."</p>
<p>"Tell me about them all," I said, consuming with a fever of
curiosity.</p>
<p>"O, I forgot you did not know them. Shall I begin with the young
ladies?--(Sam, there's a stone in Jerry's off fore-foot; get down
and look about it--Steady!--there, I knew it)--Excuse me, Miss
d'Estr&eacute;e. Well,--the young ladies. There's one of our
cousins, a grand, handsome, sombre, estimable girl, whom nobody
ever flirts with, but whom somebody will marry. That's Henrietta
Palmer. Then there is Charlotte Benson--not pretty, but stylish and
so clever. She carries too many guns for most men; she is a capital
girl in her way. Then there is Mary Leighton; she is small, blonde,
lovely. I do not believe in her particularly, but we are great
friends, and flirt a little, I am told. I quite wonder how you will
like each other. I hope you will tell me your impressions. No doubt
she will be rather your companion, for Henrietta and Charlotte
Benson are desperately intimate, and have a room together. They are
quite romantic and very superior. Pretty Miss Leighton isn't in
their line exactly, and is rather left to her own reflections, I
should think. But she makes up for it when the gentlemen appear;
she isn't left with any time upon her hands, you may be sure. I
don't know what it is about her; she never said a bright thing in
her life, and a great, great many silly ones; but everybody wants
to talk to her, and her silly words are precious to the man to whom
she says them. Did you ever meet anybody like her?"</p>
<p>"I? oh no. I never met anybody," I said, half-bitterly,
beginning to be afraid of the people whom I so soon should meet;
and then I began to talk about the road, and to inquire how far we
had yet to drive, and to ask to have a shawl about my shoulders. It
was not yet seven o'clock, but the country air was fresh and cool,
and the rapid driving made it cooler.</p>
<p>"We are almost there; and I hope, Miss d'Estr&eacute;e, that you
won't feel as if you were going among strangers. You will not feel
so long, at any rate. It is too bad Richard isn't here; you know
him so much better than the rest of us. But before he comes back, I
am sure you will feel as much at home as he. But here's the
gate."</p>
<p>There was a drive of perhaps an eighth of a mile from the gate
to the house: the trees and hedge were thick, so that one saw
little of the house from the road. The grounds were well kept;
there was a nice lawn, in front of the house, and some very fine
old trees. The house was low and irregular, but quite picturesque.
It fronted the road; the rear looked toward the river, about
quarter of a mile distant, and of which the view was lovely.</p>
<p>There was a piazza in front, on which four ladies stood; one of
them came forward, and came down the steps, and met me as I got out
of the carriage. That, of course, was Mrs. Hollenbeck, She welcomed
me very cordially, and led me up the steps of the piazza, where the
young ladies stood. Terrible young ladies! I shook with fear of
them. I felt as if I did not know anything, as if I did not look
well, as if my clothes were hideous. I should not have been afraid
of young or old men, nor of old women; but they were just my age,
just my class, just my equals, or ought to have been, if I had had
any other fate than Uncle Leonard and Varick-street. How they would
criticize me! How soon they would find out I had never been
anywhere before! I wished for Richard then with all my heart.
Kilian had already deserted me, and was talking to Miss Leighton,
who had come half-way down the steps to meet him, and who only gave
me a glance and a very pretty smile and nod, when Mrs. Hollenbeck
presented me to them. Miss Benson and Miss Palmer each gave me a
hand, and looked me over horribly; and the tones of their voices,
when they spoke to me, were so constrained and cold, and so
different from the tones in which they addressed each other. I
hated them.</p>
<p>After a few moments of wretchedness, Sophie proposed to take me
to my room. We went up the stairs, which were steep and
old-fashioned, with a landing-place almost like a little room. My
room was in a wing of the house, over the dining-room, and the
windows looked out on the river. It was not large, but was very
pretty. The windows were curtained, and the bed was dainty, and the
little mantel was draped, and the ornaments and pictures were
quaint and delightful to my taste.</p>
<p>Sophie laid the shawls she had been carrying up for me upon the
bed, and said she hoped I would find everything I needed, and would
try to feel entirely at home, and not hesitate to ask for anything
that would make me comfortable.</p>
<p>Nothing could be kinder, but my affection and gratitude were
fast dying out, and I was quite sure of one thing, namely, that I
never should love Sophie if she spent her life in inviting me to
pay her visits. She told me that tea would be ready in half an
hour, and then left me. I sat down on the bed when she was gone,
and wished myself back in Varick-street; and then cried, to think
that I should be homesick for such a dreary home. But the appetites
and affections common to humanity had not been left out of my
heart, though I had been beggared all my life in regard to most of
them. I could have loved a mother so--a sister--I could have had
such happy feelings for a place that I could have felt was home.
What matter, if I could not even remember the smile on my mother's
lips; what matter, if no brother or sister had ever been born to
me; if no house had ever been my rightful home? I was hungry for
them all the same. And these first glimpses of the happy lives of
others seemed to disaffect me more than ever with my own.</p>

<p>The servant came to call me down to tea while I was still
sitting with my face in my hands upon the bed. I started up, lit
the candles on the dressing-table, arranged my hair, washed the
tears off my face, and hurried down the stairs. They were waiting
for me in the parlor, and no doubt were quite impatient, as they
had already waited for the arrival of the evening train, and it was
nearly eight o'clock. The evening train had brought Mr. Eugene
Whitney, of whom I can only say, that he was a very insignificant
young man indeed. We all moved into the dining-room; the others
took the seats they were accustomed to. Mr. Whitney and I, being
the only new-comers, were advised which seats belonged to us by a
trim young maid-servant, and I, for one, was very glad to get into
mine. Mr. Whitney was my neighbor on one hand, the youngest of the
Hollenbeck boys on the other. These were our seats:</p>

<p>The seat opposite me was not filled when we sat down.</p>
<p>"Where is Mr. Langenau, Charley?" said his mother.</p>
<p>"I'm sure I don't know, mamma," said Charley, applying himself
to marmalade.</p>
<p>"Charley doesn't see much of his tutor out of hours, I think,"
said Miss Benson.</p>
<p>"A good deal too much of him in 'em," murmured Charley, between
a spoonful of marmalade and a drink of milk.</p>
<p>"Benny's the boy that loves his book," said Kilian; "he's the
joy of his tutor's heart, I know," at which there was a general
laugh, and Benny, the younger, looked up with a merry smile.</p>
<p>The Hollenbeck boys were not fond of study. They were healthy
and pretty; quite the reverse of intellectual; very fair and rosy,
without much resemblance to their mother or her brothers. It was
evident the acquisition of knowledge was far from being the
principal pursuit of their lives, and the tutor was looked upon as
the natural enemy of Charley, at the least.</p>
<p>"I don't see what you ever got him for, mamma," said Charley.
"I'd study just as much without him."</p>
<p>"And that wouldn't be pledging yourself to very much, would it,
Charley dear?"</p>
<p>"Wish he was back in Germany with his ugly books," cried
Charley.</p>
<p>But--hush!--there was a sudden lull, as the tutor entered and
took his place by Charley. He was a well-made man, evidently about
thirty. He was so decidedly a gentleman, in manners and appearance,
that even these spoiled boys treated him respectfully, and the
young ladies and gentlemen at the table were more stiff than
offensive in their manner. But he was so evidently not one of
them!</p>
<p>It is very disagreeable to be among people who know each other
very well, even if they try to know you very well and admit you to
their friendship. But I had no assurance that any one was trying to
do this for <i>me</i>, and I am afraid I showed very little
inclination to be admitted to their friendship. I could not talk,
and I did not want to be talked to. I was even afraid of the little
boys, and thought all the time that Charley was watching me and
making signs about me to his brother, when in reality he was only
telegraphing about the marmalade.</p>
<p>In the meantime, without any attention to my feelings, the
business of the tea-table proceeded. Mrs. Hollenbeck poured out
tea, and kept the little boys under a moderate control. Kilian cut
up some birds before him, and tried to persuade the young ladies to
eat some, but nobody had appetite enough but Mr. Whitney and
himself. Charlotte Benson, who was clever and efficient and
exceedingly at home, cut up a cake that was before her, and gave
the boys some strawberries, and offered some to me. Miss Palmer
simply looked very handsome, and eat a biscuit or two, and tried to
talk to Mr. Whitney, who seemed to have a good appetite and very
little conversation. Miss Leighton gave herself up to attentions to
Kilian; she was saying silly little things to him in a little low
tone all the time, and offering him different articles before her,
and advising him what he ought to eat; all of which seemed most
interesting and important in dumb-show till you heard what it was
all about, and then you felt ashamed of them. At times, I think,
Kilian felt somewhat ashamed too, and tried to talk a little to the
others; but most of the time he seemed to like it very well, and
did not ask anything better than the excellent woodcock on his
plate, and the pretty young woman by his side.</p>
<p>"By the way," said Sophie, when the meal was nearly over, "I had
a letter from Richard to-day."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Kilian, with a momentary release from his admirer.
"And when is he coming home?"</p>
<p>I looked up with quick interest, and met Mrs. Hollenbeck's eyes,
which seemed to be always on me. Then I turned mine down the table
uncomfortably, and found Charlotte Benson looking at me too. I did
not know what I had done to be looked at, but wished they would
look at themselves and let me take my tea (or leave it alone) in
peace.</p>
<p>"Not for two weeks yet," said his sister; "not for two whole
weeks."</p>
<p>"How sorry I am," said Charlotte Benson.</p>
<p>"I think we are all sorry," said Henrietta the tranquil.</p>
<p>"Miss d'Estr&eacute;e confided to me that she'd be glad to see
him," said Kilian, cutting up another woodcock and looking at his
plate.</p>
<p>"Indeed I shall," I said, with, a little sigh, not thinking so
much about them as feeling most earnestly what a difference his
coming would make, and how sure I should be of having at least one
friend when he got here.</p>
<p>"He seems to be having a delightful time," said his sister.</p>
<p>"I am glad to hear that," I said, interested. "Generally he
finds it such a bore. He doesn't seem to like to travel." I was
rather startled at the sound of my own voice and the attention of
my audience; but I had been betrayed into speaking, by my interest
in the subject, and my surprise at hearing he was having such a
pleasant time.</p>
<p>"Ah!" she said, "don't you think he does? At any rate, he seems
to be enjoying this journey, and to be in no hurry to come back. I
looked for him last week."</p>
<p>Warned by my last experience, I said nothing in answer; and
after a moment Kilian said:</p>
<p>"Well, if Richard's having a good time, you may be sure he's
made some favorable negotiation, and comes home with good news for
the firm. That's his idea of a good time, you know."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Sophie, gently, "that's his brother's idea of his
idea. It isn't mine."</p>
<p>Charlotte Benson seemed a little nettled at this, and
exclaimed,</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hollenbeck! you are making us all unhappy. You are leading
us to suspect that the stern man of business is unbending. What's
the influence at work? What makes this journey different from other
journeys? Where does he tarry, oh, where?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" said Sophie, with a little laugh. "You cannot say I
have implied anything of the sort. Cannot Richard enjoy a journey
without your censure or suspicion? You must be careful; he does not
fancy teasing."</p>
<p>"O, I shall not accuse him, you may be sure; that is, if he ever
comes. Do you believe he really ever will?"</p>
<p>"Not if he thinks you want him," said Kilian, amiably. "He has a
great aversion to being made much of."</p>
<p>"Yes, a family trait," interrupted Charlotte, at which everybody
laughed, no one more cordially than Miss Leighton.</p>
<p>"Leave off laughing at my Uncle Richard," said Benny, stoutly,
with his cheeks quite flushed.</p>
<p>"We have, dear, and are laughing at your Uncle Kilian. You don't
object to that, I'm sure," and Charlotte Benson leaned forward and
threw him a little kiss past the tutor, who wore a silent,
abstracted look, in odd contrast with the animated expressions of
the faces all around him.</p>
<p>Benny did not like the joke at all, and got down from his chair
and walked away without permission. We all followed him, going into
the hall, and from thence to the piazza, as the night was fine. The
tutor walked silently through the group in the hall to a seat where
lay his book and hat, then passed through the doorway and
disappeared from sight.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>The next day, the first of my visit, was a very sultry one, and
the rest of the party thought it was, no doubt, a very dull
one.</p>
<p>Kilian and Mr. Eugene Whitney went away in the early train, not
to return, alas, till the evening of the following day. Miss
Leighton was languid, and yawned incessantly, though she tried to
appear interested in things, and was very attentive to me.
Charlotte Benson and Henrietta laid strong-minded plans for the
day, and carried them out faithfully. First, they played a game of
croquet, under umbrellas, for the sun was blazing on the ground:
that was for exercise; then, for mental discipline, they read
history for an hour in the library; and then, for relaxation, under
veils and sunhats, read Ruskin for two hours by the river.</p>
<p>I cannot think Henrietta understood Ruskin, but I have no doubt
she thought she did, and tried to share in her friend's enthusiasm.
Sophie had a little headache, and spent much of the morning in her
room. The boys were away with their tutor in the farm-house where
they had their school-room, and the house seemed deserted and
delightful. I wandered about at ease, chose my book, and sat for
hours in the boat-house by the river, not reading Ruskin, nor even
my poor little novel, but gazing and dreaming and wondering. It can
be imagined what the country seemed to me, in beautiful summer
weather, after the dreary years I had spent in a city-street.</p>
<p>It is quite impossible to describe all that seemed starting into
life within me, all at once--- so many new forces, so much new
life.</p>
<p>My home-sickness had passed away, and I was inclined to be very
happy, particularly in the liberty that seemed to promise. Dinner
was very quiet, and every one seemed dull, even Charlotte Benson,
who ordinarily had life enough for all. The boys were there, but
their tutor had gone away on a long walk and would not be back till
evening. "<i>A la bonne heure</i>," cried Madame, with a little
yawn; "freedom of the halls, and deshabille, for one
afternoon."</p>
<p>So we spent the afternoon with our doors open, and with books,
or without books, on the bed.</p>
<p>Nobody came into my room, except Mrs. Hollenbeck for a few
moments, looking very pretty in a white peignoir, and rather sleepy
at the same time; hoping I was comfortable and had found something
to amuse me in the library.</p>
<p>It seemed to be thought a great bore to dress, to judge from the
exclamations of ennui which I heard in the hall, as six o'clock
approached, and the young ladies wandered into each other's room
and bewailed the necessity. I think Miss Leighton would have been
very glad to have stayed on the bed, and tried to sleep away the
hours that presented no amusement; but Charlotte Benson laughed at
her so cruelly, that she began to dress at once, and said, she had
not intended what she said, of course.</p>
<p>I was the first to be ready, and went down to the piazza. The
heat of the day was over and there was a soft, pleasant breeze. We
were to have tea at seven o'clock, and while I sat there, the bell
rang. The tutor came in from under the trees where he had been
reading, looking rather pale after his long walk.</p>
<p>He bowed slightly as he passed me, and waited at the other end
of the piazza, reading as he stood, till the others came down to
the dining-room. As we were seating ourselves he came in and took
his place, with a bow to me and the others. Mrs. Hollenbeck asked
him a little about his expedition, and paid him a little more
attention than usual, being the only man.</p>
<p>He had a most fortunate way of saying just the right thing and
then being silent; never speaking unless addressed, and then
conveying exactly the impression he desired. I think he must have
appeared in a more interesting light that usual at this meal, for
as we went out from the dining room Mary Leighton put her arm
through mine and whispered "Poor fellow! How lonely he must be!
Let's ask him to go and walk with us this evening."</p>
<p>Before I could remonstrate or detach myself from her, she had
twisted herself about, in a peculiarly supple and child-like manner
that she had, and had made the suggestion to him.</p>
<p>He was immeasurably surprised, no doubt, but he gave no sign of
it. After a silence of two or three instants, during which, I
think, he was occupied in trying to find a way to decline, he
assented very sedately.</p>
<p>Charlotte Benson and her friend, who were behind us, were
enraged at this proceeding. During the week they had all been in
the house together, they had never gone beyond speaking terms with
the tutor, and this they had agreed was the best way to keep
things, and it seemed to be his wish no less than theirs. Here was
this saucy girl, in want of amusement, upsetting all their plans.
They shortly declined to go to walk with us: and so Mary Leighton,
Mr. Langenau, and I started alone toward the river.</p>
<p>It must be confessed, Miss Leighton was not rewarded for her
effort, for a stiffer and more uncomfortable companion could not be
imagined. He entirely declined to respond to her coquetry, and she
very soon found she must abandon this role; but she was nothing if
not coquettish, and the conversation flagged uncomfortably. Before
we reached home she was quite impatient, and ran up the steps, when
we got there, as if it were a great relief. The tutor raised his
hat when he left us at the door, turned back, and disappeared for
the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>The next morning, coming down-stairs half an hour before
breakfast, I went into the library (a little room at the right of
the front door), for a book I had left there. I threw myself into
an easy-chair, and opened it, when I caught sight of the tutor,
reading at the window. I half started to my feet, and then sank
back again in confusion; for what was there to go away for?</p>
<p>He rose and bowed, and resumed his seat and his book.</p>
<p>The room was quite small, and we were very near each other. How
I could possibly have missed seeing him as I entered, now surprised
me. I longed to go away, but did not dare do anything that would
seem rude. He appeared very much engrossed with his book, but I,
for my part, could not read a word, and was only thinking how I
could get away. Possibly he guessed at my embarrassment, for after
about ten minutes he arose, and coming up to the table by which I
sat, he took up a card, and placed it in his book for a mark, and
shut it up, then made some remark to me about the day.</p>
<p>The color was coming and going in my face.</p>
<p>He must have felt sorry or curious, for he did not go directly
away, and continued to talk of things that did not require me to
answer him.</p>
<p>I do not know what it was about his voice that was so different
from the ordinary voices of people. There was a quality in it that
I had never heard in any other. But perhaps it was in the ear that
listened, as well as the voice that spoke. And apart from the
tones, the words I never could forget. The most trivial things that
he ever said to me, I can remember to this day.</p>
<p>I believe that this was not of my imagination, but that others
felt it in some degree as I did. It was this that made him such an
invaluable teacher; he impressed upon those flesh-and-blood boys,
in that one summer, more than they would have learned in whole
years from ordinary persons. It was not very strange, then, that I
was smitten with the strangest interest in all he said and did, and
that his words made the deepest impression on me.</p>
<p>No doubt it is pleasant to be listened to by one whose face
tells you you are understood; and the tutor was not in a hurry to
go away. He had got up from the window, I know, with the intention
of going out of the room, but he continued standing, looking down
at me and talking, for half an hour at least.</p>
<p>The soft morning wind came in at the open door and window, with
a scent of rose and honeysuckle: the pretty little room was full of
the early sunshine in which there is no glare: I can see it all
now, and I can hear, as ever, his low voice.</p>
<p>He talked of the book I held in my hand, of the views on the
river, of the pleasantness of country life. I fancy I did not say
much, though I never am able to remember what I said when talking
to him. Whatever I said was a mere involuntary accord with him. I
never recollect to have felt that I did not agree with and admire
every word he uttered.</p>
<p>How different his manner from last night when he had talked with
Mary Leighton; all the stiffness, the half-concealed repelling tone
was gone. I had not heard him speak to any one, except perhaps once
to Benny, as he spoke now. I was quite sure that he liked me, and
that he did not class me with the others in the house. But when the
breakfast-bell rang, he gave a slight start, and his voice changed;
and such a frown came over his face! He looked at his watch, said
something about the hour, and quickly left the room. I bent my head
over my book and sat still, till I heard them all come down and go
into the breakfast-room. I trusted they would not know he had been
talking to me, and there was little danger, unless they guessed it
from my cheeks being so aflame.</p>
<p>At breakfast he was more silent than ever, and his brow had not
quite got over that sudden frown. At dinner he was away again, as
the day before.</p>
<p>The day passed much as yesterday had done. About four o'clock
there came a telegram from Kilian to his sister. He had been
delayed, and Mr. Whitney would wait for him, and they would come
the next evening by the boat. I think Mary Leighton could have
cried if she had not been ashamed. Her pretty blue organdie was on
the bed ready to put on. It went back into the wardrobe very
quickly, and she came down to tea in a gray bar&eacute;ge that was
a little shabby.</p>
<p>A rain had come on about six o'clock. At tea the candles were
lit, and the windows closed. Every one looked moped and dull; the
evening promised to be insufferable. Mrs. Hollenbeck saw the
necessity of rousing herself and providing us some amusement. When
Mr. Langenau entered, she met his bow with one of her best smiles:
how the change must have struck him; for she had been very
mechanical and polite to him before. Now she spoke to him with the
charming manner that brought every one to her feet.</p>
<p>And what was the cause of this sudden kindness? It is very easy
for me to see now, though then I had not a suspicion. Alas! I am
afraid that the cheeks aflame at breakfast-time were the immediate
cause of the change. Mrs. Hollenbeck would not have made so marked
a movement for an evening's entertainment: it seemed to suit her
very well that I should talk to the tutor in the library before
breakfast, and she meant to give me opportunities for talking to
him in the parlor too.</p>
<p>"A dreary evening, is it not?" she began. "What shall we all do?
Charlotte, can't you think of something?"</p>
<p>Charlotte, who had her own plans for a quiet evening by the lamp
with a new book, of course could not think of anything.</p>
<p>"Henrietta, at least you shall give us some music, and Mr.
Langenau, I am sure you will be good enough to help us; I will send
over to the school-room for that flute and those piles of music
that I've seen upon a shelf, and you will be charitable enough to
play for us."</p>
<p>"I must beg you will not take that trouble."</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Langenau, that is selfish now."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hollenbeck did not press the subject then, but made herself
thoroughly delightful during tea, and as we rose from the table
renewed the request in a low tone to Mr. Langenau: and the result
was, a little after eight o'clock he came into the parlor where we
sat. A place was made for him at the table around which we were
sitting, and Mrs. Hollenbeck began the process of putting him at
his ease. There was no need. The tutor was quite as much at ease as
any one, and, in a little while, imperceptibly became the person to
whom we were all listening.</p>
<p>Charlotte Benson at last gave up her book, and took her work-box
instead. We were no longer moping and dull around the table. And
bye and bye Henrietta, much alarmed, was sent to the piano, and her
poor little music certainly sounded very meagre when Mr. Langenau
touched the keys.</p>
<p>I think he consented to play not to appear rude, but with the
firm intention of not being the instrument of our entertainment,
and not being made use of out of his own accepted calling. But
happily for us, he soon forgot all about us, and played on,
absorbed in himself and in his music. We listened breathlessly, the
others quite as much engrossed as I, because they all knew much
more of music than I did. Suddenly, after playing for a long while,
he started from the piano, and came back to the table. He was
evidently agitated. Before the others could say a word of thanks or
wonder, I cried, in a fear of the cessation of what gave me such
intense pleasure,</p>
<p>"Oh, sing something; can't you sing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I can sing," he said, looking down at me with those
dangerous eyes. "Will it give you pleasure if I sing for you?"</p>
<p>He did not wait for an answer, but turned back to the piano.</p>
<p>He had said "if I sing for you," and I knew that for me he was
singing. I do not know what it was for others, but for me, it was
the only true music that I had ever heard, the only music that I
could have begged might never cease, but flood over all the present
and the future, satisfying every sense. Other voices had roused and
thrilled, this filled me. I asked no more, and could have died with
that sound in my ears.</p>
<p>"Why, Pauline! child! what is it?" cried Mrs. Hollenbeck, as the
music ceased and Mr. Langenau. again came back to the circle round
the table. Every one looked: I was choking with sobs.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't, I don't want you to speak to me," I cried, putting
away her hand and darting from the room. I was not ashamed of
myself, even when I was alone in my room. The powerful magic lasted
still, through the silence and darkness, till I was aroused by the
voices of the others coming up to bed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hollenbeck knocked at my door with her bedroom candle in
her hand, and, as she stood talking to me, the others strayed in to
join her and to satisfy their curiosity.</p>
<p>"You are very sensitive to music, are you not?" said Charlotte
Benson, contemplatively. She had tried me on Mompssen, and the
"Seven Lamps," and found me wanting, and now perhaps hoped to find
some other point less faulty.</p>
<p>"I do not know," I said, honestly. "I seem to have been very
sensitive to-night."</p>
<p>"But you are not always?" asked Henrietta Palmer. "You do not
always cry when people sing?"</p>
<p>"Why, no," I said with great contempt. "But I never heard any
one sing like that before."</p>
<p>"He does sing well," said Mrs. Hollenbeck, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Immense expression and a fine voice," added Charlotte
Benson.</p>
<p>"He has been educated for the stage, you may be sure," said Mary
Leighton, with a little spite. "As Miss d'Estr&eacute;e says, I
never heard anyone sing like that, out of the chorus of an
opera."</p>
<p>"Well, I think," returned Charlotte Benson, "if there were many
voices like that in ordinary choruses, one would be glad to
dispense with the solos and duets."</p>
<p>"Oh, you would not find his voice so wonderful, if you heard it
out of a parlor. It is very well, but it would not fill a concert
hall, much less an opera house. No; you may be sure he has been
educated for some of those German choruses; you know they are very
fine musicians."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know that it is anything to us what he was
educated for," said Charlotte Benson, sharply. "He has given us a
very delightful evening, and I, for one, am much obliged to
him."</p>
<p>"<i>Et moi aussi"</i> murmured Henrietta, wreathing her large
beautiful arms about her friend, and the two sauntered away.</p>
<p>Mary Leighton, in general ill-humor, and still remembering the
walk of the last evening, desired to fire a parting-shot, and
exclaimed, as she went out, "Well, I think it is something to us; I
like to have gentlemen about me."</p>
<p>"You need not be uneasy," said Mrs. Hollenbeck, a little
stiffly. "I think Mr. Langenau is a gentleman."</p>
<p>But at this moment his step was heard in the hall below, and
there was an end put to the conversation.</p>

<h3>MATINAL.</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Last night, when some one spoke his name,<br>
From my swift blood that went and came<br>
A thousand little shafts of flame<br>
Were shivered in my narrow frame.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>

<br>
<p>The next morning was brilliant and cool, the earth and heavens
shining after the rain of the past night. I was dressed long, long
before breakfast: it would be so tiresome to wait in my room till
the bell rang; yet if I went down-stairs, would it not look as if I
wanted to see Mr. Langenau again? I need not go to the library, of
course, but I could scarcely avoid being seen from the library if I
went out. But why suppose that he would be down again so early? It
was very improbable, and so, affectionately deceived, I put on a
hat and walking-jacket and stole down the stairs. I saw by the
clock in the lower hall that it was half an hour earlier than I had
come down the morning before; at which I was secretly chagrined,
for now there was no danger, <i>alias</i> hope, of seeing Mr.
Langenau.</p>
<p>But probably he had forgotten all about the foolish half-hour
that had given me so much to think about. I glanced into the
library, which was empty, and hurried out of the hall-door,
secretly disappointed.</p>
<p>I took the path that led over the hill to the river. It passed
through the garden, under the long arbors of grapevines, over the
hill, and through a grove of maples, ending at the river where the
boat-house stood. The brightness of the morning was not lost on me,
and before I reached the maple-grove I was buoyant and happy. At
the entrance of the grove (which was traversed by several paths,
the principal coming up directly from the river) I came suddenly
upon the tutor, walking rapidly, with a pair of oars over his
shoulder. He started, and for a moment we both stood still and did
not speak. I could only think with confusion of my emotion when he
sang.</p>
<p>"You are always early," he said, with his slight, very slight,
foreign accent, "earlier than yesterday by half an hour," he added,
looking at his watch. My heart gave a great bound of pleasure. Then
he had not forgotten! How he must have seen all this.</p>
<p>He stood and talked with me for some moments, and then
desperately I made a movement to go on. I do not believe, at least
I am not sure, that at first he had any intention of going with me.
But it was not in human nature to withstand the flattery of such
emotion as his presence seemed always to inspire in me; and then, I
have no doubt, he had a certain pleasure in talking to me outside
of that; and then the morning was so lovely and he had so much of
books.</p>
<p>He proposed to show me a walk I had not taken. There was a
little hesitation in his manner, but he was reassured by my look of
pleasure, and throwing down the oars under a tree, he turned and
walked beside me. No doubt he said to himself, "America! This
paradise of girlhood;--there can be no objection." It was heavenly
sweet, that walk--the birds, the sky, the dewiness and freshness of
all nature and all life. It seemed the unstained beginning of all
things to me.</p>
<p>The woods were wet; we could not go through them, and so we went
a longer way, along the river and back by the road.</p>
<p>This time he did not do all the talking, but made me talk, and
listened carefully to all I said; and I was so happy, talking was
not any effort.</p>
<p>At last he made some allusion to the music of last night; that
he was so glad to see that I loved music as I did. "But I don't
particularly," I said in confusion, with a great fear of being
dishonest, "at least I never thought I did before, and I am so
ignorant. I don't want you to think I know anything about it, for
you would be disappointed." He was silent, and, I felt sure,
because he was already disappointed; in fear of which I went on to
say--</p>
<p>"I never heard any one sing like that before; I am very sorry
that it gave any one an impression that I had a knowledge of music,
when I hadn't. I don't care about it generally, except in church,
and I can't understand what made me feel so yesterday."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is because you were in the mood for it," he said.
"It is often so, one time music gives us pleasure, another time it
does not."</p>
<p>"That may be so; but your voice, in speaking, even, seems to me
different from any other. It is almost as good as music when you
speak; only the music fills me with such feelings."</p>
<p>"You must let me sing for you again," he said, rather low, as we
walked slowly on.</p>
<p>"Ah; if you only will," I answered, with a deep sigh of
satisfaction.</p>
<p>We walked on in silence till we reached the gate: he opened it
for me and then said, "Now I must leave you, and go back for the
oars."</p>
<p>I was secretly glad of this; since the walk had reached its
natural limit and its end must be accepted, it was a relief to
approach the house alone and not be the subject of any
observation.</p>
<p>Breakfast had began: no one seemed to feel much interest in my
entrance, though flaming with red roses and red cheeks.</p>
<p>They were of the sex that do not notice such things naturally,
with much interest or admiration. They had hardly "shaken off
drowsy-hed," and had no pleasure in anything but their breakfast,
and not much in that.</p>
<p>"How do you manage to get yourself up and dressed at such
inhuman hours?" said Mary Leighton, querulously.</p>
<p>"You are a reproach to the household, and we will not suffer
it," said Charlotte Benson.</p>
<p>"I never could understand this thing of getting up before you
are obliged to," added Henrietta plaintively.</p>
<p>But Sophie seemed well satisfied, particularly when Mr. Langenau
came in and I looked down into my cup of tea, instead of saying
good-morning to him. He did not say very much, though there was a
good deal of babble among the others, principally about his
music.</p>
<p>It was becoming the fashion to be very attentive to him. He was
made to promise to play in the evening; to bring down his books of
music for the benefit of Miss Henrietta, who wanted to practice,
Heaven knows what of his. His advice was asked about styles of
playing and modes of instruction; he was deferred to as an
authority. But very little he seemed to care about it all, I
thought.</p>

<br>
<p>Two weeks more passed: two weeks that seem to me so many years
when I look back upon them. Many more walks, early and late, many
evenings of music, many accidents of meeting. It is all like a
dream. At seventeen it is so easy to dream! It does not take two
weeks for a girl to fall in love and make her whole life
different.</p>
<p>It was Saturday evening, and Richard was expected; Richard and
Kilian and Mr. Eugene Whitney. Ah, Richard was coming just three
weeks too late.</p>
<p>We were all waiting on the piazza for them, in pretty toilettes
and excellent tempers. It was a lovely evening; the sunset was
filling the sky with splendor, and Charlotte and Henrietta had gone
to the corner of the piazza whence the river could be seen, and
were murmuring fragments of verses to each other. They were not so
much absorbed, however, but that they heard the first sound of the
wheels inside the gate, and hurried back to join us by the
steps.</p>
<p>Mary Leighton looked absolutely lovely. The blue organdie had
seen the day at last, and she was in such a flutter of delight at
the coming of the gentlemen that she could scarcely be recognized
as the pale, flimsy young person who had moped so unblushingly all
the week.</p>
<p>"They are all three there," she exclaimed with suppressed
rapture, as the carriage turned the angle of the road that brought
them into sight. Mrs. Hollenbeck, quite beaming with pleasure, ran
down the steps (for Richard had been away almost two months), and
Mary Leighton was at her side, of course. Charlotte Benson and
Henrietta went half-way down the steps, and I stood on the piazza
by the pillar near the door.</p>
<p>I was a little excited by their coming, too, but not nearly as
much so as I might have been three weeks ago. A subject of much
greater interest occupied my mind that very moment, and related to
the chances of the tutor's getting home in time for tea, from one
of those long walks that were so tiresome. I felt as if I hardly
needed Richard now. Still, dear old Richard! It was very nice to
see him once again.</p>
<p>The gentlemen all sprang out of the carriage, and a Babel of
welcomes and questions and exclamations arose. Richard kissed his
sister, and answered some of her many questions, then shook hands
with the young ladies, but I could see that his eye was searching
for me. I can't tell why, certainly not because I felt at all shy,
I had stepped back, a little behind the pillar and the vines. In an
instant he saw me, and came quickly up the steps, and stood by me
and grasped my hand, and looked exactly as if he meant to kiss me.
I hoped that nobody saw his look, and I drew back, a little
frightened. Of course, I know that he had not the least intention
of kissing me, but his look was so eager and so unusual,</p>
<p>"It is two months, Pauline," he said; "and are you well?" And
though I only said that I was well and was very glad to see him, I
am sure his sister Sophie thought that it was something more, for
she had followed him up the steps and stood in the doorway looking
at us.</p>
<p>The others came up there, and Kilian, as soon as he could get
out of the meshes of the blue organdie, came to me, and tried to
out-devotion Richard.</p>
<p>That is the way with men. He had not taken any trouble to get
away from Mary Leighton till Richard came.</p>
<p>A young woman only needs one lover very much in earnest, to
bring about her several others, not so much, perhaps, in earnest,
but very amusing and instructive. Richard went away very quickly,
for I am sure he did not like that sort of thing.</p>
<p>It was soon necessary for Mr. Kilian to suspend his devotion and
go to his room to get ready for tea.</p>
<p>When we all assembled again, at the table, I found that he had
placed himself beside me, next his sister, little Benny having gone
to bed.</p>
<p>"Of course, the head of the table belongs to Richard; I never
interfere there, and as everybody else is placed, this is the only
seat that I can take, following the rose and thorn principle."</p>
<p>"But that principle is not followed strictly," cried Charlotte
Benson, who sat by Mary Leighton. "Here are two roses and no
thorn."</p>
<p>"Ah! What a strange oversight," he exclaimed, seating himself
nevertheless. "The only way to remedy it will be to put the tutor
in your place, Miss Benson, and you come opposite Miss Pauline.
Quick; before he comes and refuses to move his Teutonic bones an
inch." Charlotte Benson changed her seat and the vacant one was
left between her and Mary Leighton.</p>
<p>This is the order of our seats, for that and many following
happy nights and days:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Mary Leighton looked furious and could hardly speak a word all
through the meal. It was particularly hard upon her, as the tutor
did not come, and the chair was empty, and a glaring insult to her
all the time.</p>
<p>Kilian had done his part so innocently and so simply that it was
hard to suspect him of any intention to pique her and annoy
Richard, but I am sure he did it with just those two intentions. He
was as thorough a flirt as any woman, and withal very fond of
change, and I think my pink grenadine quite dazzled him as I stood
on the piazza. Then came the brotherly and quite natural desire to
outshine Richard and put things out a little. I liked it all very
much, and was charmed to be of so much consequence, for I saw all
this quite plainly. I laughed and talked a good deal with Kilian;
he was delightful to laugh and talk with. Even Eugene Whitney found
me more worth his weak attention than the beautiful and placid
Henrietta.</p>
<p>The amusement was chiefly at our end of the table. But amidst
it, I did not fail to glance often at the door and wonder,
uncomfortably, why the tutor did not come.</p>
<p>As we left the table and lingered for a few moments in the hall,
Richard came up to me and said, as he prepared to light his cigar,
"Will you not come out and walk up and down the path here with me
while I smoke?"</p>
<p>I began to make some excuse, for I wanted to do nothing just
then but watch the stairway to see if Mr. Langenau did not come
down even then and go into the dining-room.</p>
<p>But I reflected how ungracious it would seem to refuse this,
when he had just come home, and I followed him out into the
path.</p>
<p>There was no moon, but the stars were very bright, and the air
was sweet with the flower-beds in the grass along the path we
walked.</p>
<p>The house looked gay and pleasant as we walked up and down
before it, with its many lighted windows, and people with bright
dresses moving about on the piazza. Richard lit his cigar, and
said, after a silence of a few moments, with a sigh, "It is good to
be at home again."</p>
<p>"But you've had a pleasant journey?"</p>
<p>"No; the most tiresome that I ever made, and this last detention
wore my patience out. It seemed the longest fortnight. I could not
bear to think of you all here, and I away in such a dismal
hole."</p>
<p>"I suppose Uncle Leonard had no pity on you, as long as there
was a penny to be made by staying there."</p>
<p>"No; I spent a great deal of money in telegraphing to him for
orders to come home, but he would not give up."</p>
<p>"And how is Uncle Leonard; did you go to Varick-street?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed; I did not waste any time in town. I only reached
there yesterday."</p>
<p>"I wonder Uncle Leonard let you off so soon."</p>
<p>"He growled a good deal, but I did not stay to listen."</p>
<p>"That's always the best way."</p>
<p>"And now, Pauline, tell me how you like the place."</p>
<p>"Like it! Oh, Richard, I think it is a Paradise," and I clasped
my hands in a young sort of ecstacy.</p>
<p>He was silent, which was a sign that he was satisfied. I went on
after a moment, "I don't wonder that you all love it. I never saw
anything half so beautiful. The dear old house is prettier than any
new one that could be built, and the trees are so grand! And oh,
Richard, I think the garden lying on the hillside there in the
beautiful warm sun, with such royal flowers and fruit, is worth all
the grape-houses and conservatories in the neighborhood. Your
sister took us to three or four of the neighboring places a week or
two ago. But I like this a hundred times the best. I should think
you would be sorry every moment that you have to spend away from
it."</p>
<p>"I hope one of these days to live here altogether," he said in a
low tone.</p>
<p>It was so difficult for Richard to be unreserved that it is very
likely this was the first time in his life that he had ever
expressed this, the brightest hope he had.</p>
<p>I could fancy all these few words implied--a wife, children, a
happy home in manhood where he had been a happy child.</p>
<p>"It belongs to Kilian and me, but it is understood I have the
right to it when I am ready for it."</p>
<p>"And your sister--it does not belong at all to her?"</p>
<p>"No, she only keeps house for us. It would make a great change
for Sophie if either of us married. But then I know that it would
give her pleasure, for I am sure that she would not be
selfish."</p>
<p>I was not so sure, but, of course, I did not say so. At this
moment, while Richard smoked and I walked silently beside him, a
dark figure struck directly across the path before us. The
apparition was so sudden that I sprang and screamed, and caught
Richard by the arm.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," said the tutor, with a quick look of
surprise at me and then at Richard, and bowing, strode on into the
house.</p>
<p>"That's the German Sophie has taken for the boys, is it?" said
Richard, knitting his brows, and looking after him, with no great
approbation. "I don't half like the idea of his being here: I told
Sophie so at starting. A governess would do as well for two years
yet. What kind of a person does he seem to be?"</p>
<p>"I don't know--that is--I can't tell exactly. I don't know him
well enough," I answered in confusion, which Richard did not
see.</p>
<p>"No, of course not. You would not be likely to see him except at
the table. But it is awkward having him here,--so much of the week,
no man about; and one never knows anything about these
Germans."</p>
<p>"I thought--your sister said--you knew all about him," I said,
in rather a low voice.</p>
<p>"As much as one needs to know about a mere teacher. But the
person you have in your house all the time is different."</p>
<p>"But he is a gentleman," I put in more firmly.</p>
<p>"I hope he is. He had letters to some friends of ours. But what
are letters? People give them when they're asked for them, and half
the time know nothing of the person for whom they do the favor,
besides his name and general standing. Hardly that, sometimes."
Then, as if to put away a tiresome and unwelcome subject, he began
again to talk about the place.</p>
<p>But I had lost my interest in the subject, and thought only of
returning to the house.</p>
<p>"Don't," I said, playfully putting out my hand as he took out
another cigar to light. "You have smoked enough to-night. Do you
know, you smoke a great deal more than is good for you."</p>
<p>"Well, I will not smoke any more to-night if you say so. Only
don't go in the house."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you know we only came out to smoke."</p>
<p>He stood in front of the path that led to the piazza and said,
in an affectionate, gentle way, "Stay and walk a little longer. I
have not told you half how glad I am that you are here at
last."</p>
<p>"Oh, as for that, you've got a good many weeks to tell me in.
Besides, it's getting chilly," and I gave a little shiver.</p>
<p>"If you're cold, of course," he said, letting me pass and
following me, and added, with a shade of anxiety, "Why didn't you
tell me before? I never thought of it, and you have no shawl."</p>
<p>I felt ashamed of myself as I led the way up the piazza
steps.</p>
<p>In the hall, which was quite light, they were all standing, and
Mr. Langenau was in the group. They were petitioning him for
music.</p>
<p>"Oh, he has promised that he will sing," said Sophie; "but
remember he has not had his tea. I have ordered it for you, Mr.
Langenau; it will be ready in a moment."</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau bowed and turned to go up the stairs. His eye met
mine, as I came into the light, dazzled a little by it.</p>
<p>He went up the stairs; the others after a few moments, went into
the parlor. I sat down on a sofa beside Mrs. Hollenbeck. Richard
was called away by a person on business. There was a shaded lamp on
a bracket above the sofa where we sat; Mrs. Hollenbeck was reading
some letters she had just received, and I took up the evening
paper, reading over and over an advertisement of books. Presently
the servant came to Mrs. Hollenbeck and said that Mr. Langenau's
tea was ready. She was sent up to tell him so, and in a few moments
he came down. When he reached the hall, Sophie looked up with her
most lovely smile.</p>
<p>"You must be famished, Mr. Langenau; pray go immediately to the
dining-room. I am sorry not to make your tea myself, but I hear
Benny waking and must go to him. Will you mind taking my place,
Pauline, and pouring out tea for Mr. Langenau?"</p>
<p>I was bending over the paper; my face turned suddenly from red
to pale. I said something inaudible in reply, and got up and went
into the dining-room, followed by the tutor.</p>
<p>It was several minutes before I looked at him. The servants had
not favored us with much light: there was a branch of wax candles
in the middle of the table. Mr. Langenau's plate was placed just at
one side of the tray, at which I had seated myself. He looked pale,
even to his lips. I began to think of the terrible walks in which
he seemed to hunt himself down, and to wonder what was the motive,
though I had often wondered that before. He took the cup of tea I
offered him without speaking. Neither of us spoke for several
minutes, then I said, rather irresolutely, "I am sure you tire
yourself by these long walks."</p>
<p>"Do you think so? No: they rest me."</p>
<p>No doubt I felt more coquettish, and had more confidence than
usual, from the successes of that evening, and from the knowledge
that Richard and Kilian and Eugene Whitney, even, were so delighted
to talk to me; otherwise I could never have said what I said then,
by a sudden impulse, and with a half-laughing voice, "Do not go
away again so long; it makes it so dull and tiresome."</p>
<p>He looked at me and said, "It does not seem to me you miss me
very much." But such a gleam of those dark, dangerous eyes! I
looked down, but my breath came quickly and my face must have shown
the agitation that I felt.</p>
<p>At this moment Richard, released from his engagement in the
library, came through the hall and stopped at the dining-room door.
He paused for a moment at the door, walked away again, then came
back and into the room, with rather a quicker step than usual.</p>
<p>"Pauline," he said, and I started visibly, "They seem to be
waiting for you in the parlor for a game of cards."</p>
<p>His voice indicated anything but satisfaction. I half rose, then
sank back, and said, hesitatingly, "Can I pour you some more tea,
Mr. Langenau?"</p>
<p>"If it is not troubling you too much," he said in a voice that a
moment's time had hardened into sharpness.</p>
<p>Oh, the misery of that cup of tea, with Richard looking at me on
one side flushed and angry, and Mr. Langenau on the other, pale and
cynical. My hands shook so that I could not lift the teakettle, and
Richard angrily leaned down and moved it for me. The alcohol in the
lamp flamed up and scorched my arm.</p>
<p>"Oh Richard, you have burned me," I cried, dropping the cup and
wrapping my handkerchief around my arm. In an instant he was all
softness and kindness, and, I have no doubt, repentance.</p>
<p>"I am very sorry," he said; "Does it hurt you very much? Come
with me, and I will get Sophie to put something on it."</p>
<p>But Mr. Langenau did not move or show any interest in my
sufferings. I was half-crying, but I sat still and tried with the
other hand to replace the cup and fill it. Seeing that I did not
make much headway, and that Richard had stepped back, Mr. Langenau
said, "Allow me," and held the cup while I managed to pour the tea
into it. He thanked me stiffly, and without looking at either of
them I got up and went out of the room, Richard following me.</p>
<p>"Will you wait here while I call Sophie to get something for
you?" he said a little coldly.</p>
<p>"No, I do not want anything; I wish you would not say anything
more about it; it only hurt me for a moment."</p>
<p>"Will you go into the parlor, then?"</p>
<p>"No--yes, that is," I said, and capriciously went, alone, for he
did not follow me.</p>
<p>I was wanted for cards, but I would not play, and sat down by
one of the windows, a little out of the light. This window opened
upon the piazza. After a little while Richard, walking up and down
the piazza, stopped by it, and said to me: "I hope you won't think
it unreasonable in me to ask, Pauline; but how in the world did you
happen to be making tea for that--that man in there?"</p>
<p>"I happened to make tea for Mr. Langenau because your sister
asked me to," I said angrily; "you had better speak to her about
it."</p>
<p>"You may be sure I shall," he said, walking away from the
window.</p>
<p>Presently the tutor came in from the hall by the door near the
piano, and sat down by it without being asked, and began to play
softly, as if not to interrupt the game of cards. I could not help
thinking in what good taste this was, since he had promised not to
wait for any more importunities. The game at cards soon languished,
for Charlotte Benson really had an enthusiasm for music, and was
not happy till she was at liberty to give her whole attention to
it. As soon as the players were released, Kilian came over and sat
beside me. He rather wearied me, for I wanted to listen to the
music, but he was determined not to see that, and chattered so that
more than once Charlotte Benson turned impatiently and begged us
not to talk. Once Mr. Langenau himself turned and looked at us, but
Kilian only paused, and then went on again.</p>
<p>Mary Leighton had fled to the piano and was gazing at the keys
in a rapt manner, hoping, no doubt, to rouse Kilian to jealousy of
the tutor.</p>
<p>"Please go away," I said at last, "this is making me seem
rude."</p>
<p>"Do not tell me," he exclaimed, "that you are helping Mary
Leighton and Sophie to spoil this German fellow. I really did not
look for it in you. I--"</p>
<p>"I can't stay here and be talked to," I said, getting up in
despair.</p>
<p>"Then come on the piazza," he exclaimed, and we were there
almost before I knew what I was doing.</p>
<p>I suppose every one in the room saw us go out: I was in terror
when I thought what an insult it would seem to Mr. Langenau. We
walked about the piazza for some time; I am afraid Mr. Kilian found
me rather dull, for I could only listen to what was going on
inside. At last he was called away by a man from the stable, who
brought some alarming account of his beloved Tom or Jerry. If I had
been his bride at the altar, I am sure he would have left me; being
only a new and very faintly-lighted flame, he hurried off with
scarcely an apology.</p>
<p>I sat down in a piazza-chair, just outside the window at which
we had been sitting. I looked in at the window, but no one could
see me, from the position of my chair.</p>
<p>Presently Mr. Langenau left the piano, and Mary Leighton,
talking to him with effusion, walked across the room beside him,
and took her seat at this very window. He did not sit down, but
stood before her with his hat in his hand, as if he only awaited a
favorable pause to go away.</p>
<p>"Ah, where did Pauline go?" she said, glancing around. "But I
suppose we must excuse her, for to-night at least, as he has just
come home. I imagine the engagement was no surprise to you?"</p>
<p>"Of what engagement do you speak?" he said.</p>
<p>"Why! Pauline and Richard Vandermarck; you know it is quite a
settled thing. And very good for her, I think. He seems to me just
the sort of man to keep her steady and--well, improve her
character, you know. She seems such a heedless sort of girl. They
say her mother ran away and made some horrid marriage, and, I
believe, her uncle has had to keep her very strict. He is very much
pleased, I am told, with marrying her to Richard, and she herself
seems very much in love with him."</p>
<p>All this time he had stood very still and looked at her, but his
face had changed slowly as she spoke. I knew then that what she had
said had not pleased him. She went on in her babbling, soft
voice:</p>
<p>"His sister Sophie isn't pleased, of course, so there is nothing
said about it here. It <i>is</i> rather hard for her, for the place
belongs to Richard, and besides, Richard has been very generous to
her always. And then to see him marry just such a sort of
person--you know--so young--"</p>
<p>"Yes--so young," said Mr. Langenau, between his teeth, "and of
such charming innocence."</p>
<p>"Oh, as to that," said Mary Leighton, piqued beyond prudence,
"we all have our own views as to that."</p>
<p>The largess due the bearer of good news was not by right the
meed of Mary Leighton. He looked at her as if he hated her.</p>
<p>"Mr. Richard Yandermarck is a fortunate man," he said. "She has
rare beauty, if he has a taste for beauty."</p>
<p>"Men sometimes tire of that; if indeed she has it. Her coloring
is her strong point, and that may not last forever;" and Mary's
voice was no longer silvery.</p>
<p>"You think so?" he said. "I think her grace is her strong point,
'<i>la gr&acirc;ce encore plus belle que la beaut&eacute;</i>,' and
longer-lived beside. Few women move as she does, making it a
pleasure to follow her with the eyes. And her height and
suppleness: at twenty-five she will be regal."</p>
<p>"Then, Mr. Langenau," she cried, with sudden spitefulness, "you
<i>do</i> admire her very much yourself! Do you know, I thought
perhaps you did. How you must envy Mr. Vandermarck!"</p>
<p>A slight shrug of the shoulders and a slight low laugh; after
which, he said, "No, I think not. I have not the courage that is
necessary."</p>
<p>"The courage! why, what do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>"I mean that a man who ventures to love a woman in whom he
cannot trust, has need for courage and for patience; perhaps Mr.
Richard Vandermarck has them both abundantly. For me, I think the
pretty Miss Pauline would be safer as an hour's amusement than as a
life's companion."</p>
<p>The words stabbed, killed me. With an ejaculation that could
scarcely have escaped their ears, I sprang up and ran through the
hall and up the stairs. Before I reached the landing-place, I knew
that some one was behind me. I did not look or pause, but flew on
through the hall till I reached my own door. My own door was just
at the foot of the third-floor stairway. I glanced back, and saw
that it was Mr. Langenau who was behind me. I pushed open my door
and went half-way in the room; then with a vehement and sudden
impulse came back into the hall and pulled it shut again and stood
with my hand upon the latch, and waited for him to pass. In an
instant more he was near me, but not as if he saw me; he could not
reach the stairway without passing so near me that he must touch my
dress. I waited till he was so near, and said, "Mr. Langenau."</p>
<p>He raised his eyes steadily to mine and bowed low. I almost
choked for one instant, and then I found voice and rushed on
vehemently. "What she has told you is false; every word of it is
false. I am not engaged to Richard Vandermarck; I never thought of
such a thing till I came here, and found they talked about it. They
ought to be ashamed, and I will go away to-morrow. And what she
said about my mother is a wicked lie as well, at least in the way
she meant it; and I shall hate her all my life. I have been
motherless and lonely always, but God has cared for me, and I never
knew before what evil thoughts and ways there were. I am not
ashamed that I listened, though I didn't mean to stay at first. I'm
glad I heard it all and know what kind of friends I have. And those
last cruel words you said--I never will forgive you,
never--never--never till I die."</p>
<p>He had put his hand out toward me as if in conciliation, at
least I understood it so. I pushed it passionately away, rushed
into my room, bolted the door, and flung myself upon the bed with a
frightful burst of sobs. I heard his hand upon the latch of the
door, and he said my name several times in a low voice. Then he
went slowly up the stairs. And I think his room must have been
directly over mine, for, for hours I heard some one walking there;
indeed, it was the last sound I heard, when, having cried all my
tears and vowed all my vows, I fell asleep and forgot that I was
wretched.</p>

<h3>SUNDAY.</h3>
<br>
<blockquote><i>La notte &eacute; madre di pensieri</i>.<br>
<br>
Now tell me how you are as to religion?<br>
You are a clear good man--but I rather fear<br>
You have not much of it.<br>
<i>Faust</i>.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>It was all very well to talk about going away; but the matter
looked very differently by daylight. It was Sunday; and I knew I
could not go away for a day or two, and not even then without
making a horrid sort of stir, for which I had not the courage in
cold blood. Besides, I did not even know that I wanted to go if I
could. Varick-street! Hateful, hateful thought. No, I could not go
there. And though (by daylight) I still detested Mary Leighton, and
felt ashamed about Richard, and remembered all Mr. Langenau's words
(sweet as well as bitter), everything was let down a great many
degrees; from the heights of passion into the plains of
commonplace.</p>
<p>My great excitement had worked its own cure, and I was so dull
and weary that I did not even want to think of what had passed the
night before. If I had a sentiment that retained any strength, it
was that of shame and self-contempt. I could not think of myself in
any way that did not make me blush. When, however, it came to the
moment of facing every one, and going down to breakfast, I began to
know I still had some other feelings.</p>
<p>I was the last to go down. The bell had rung a very long while
before I left my room. I took my seat at the table without looking
at any one, though, of course, every one looked at me. My confused
and rather general good-morning was returned with much precision by
all. Somebody remarked that I did not look well. Somebody else
remarked that was surely because I went to bed so early; that it
never had been known to agree with any one. Some one else wanted to
know why I had gone so early, and that I had been hunted for in all
directions for a dance which had been a sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>"But as you had gone away, and the musician could not be found,
we had to give it up," said Charlotte Benson, "and we owe you both
a grudge."</p>
<p>"For my part, I am very sorry," said Mr. Langenau. "I had no
thought that you meant to dance last night, or I should have stayed
at the piano; I hope you will tell me the next time."</p>
<p>"The next time will be to-morrow evening," said Mary Leighton.
"Now, Mr. Langenau, you will not forget--or--or get excited about
anything and go away?"</p>
<p>I dared not look at Mr. Langenau's face, but I am sure I should
not have seen anything pleasant if I had. I don't know what he
answered, for I was so confused, I dropped a plate of berries which
I was just taking from Kilian's hand, and made quite an
uncomfortable commotion. The berries were very ripe, and they
rolled in many directions on the table-cloth, and fell on my white
dress.</p>
<p>"Your pretty dress is ruined, I'm afraid," said Kilian, stooping
down to save it.</p>
<p>"I don't care about that, but I'm very sorry that I've stained
the table-cloth," and I looked at Mrs. Hollenbeck as if I thought
that she would scold me for it. But she quite reassured me. Indeed,
I think she was so pleased with me, that she would not have minded
seeing me ruin all the table-cloths that she had.</p>
<p>"But it will make you late for church, for you'll have to change
your dress," said Charlotte Benson, practically, glancing at the
clock. I was very thankful for the suggestion, for I thought it
would save me from the misery of trying to eat breakfast, but
Kilian made such an outcry that I found I could not go without more
comments than I liked.</p>
<p>"You have no appetite either," said Mary Leighton. "I am ashamed
to eat as much as I want, for here is Mr. Langenau beside me, who
has only broken a roll in two and drank a cup of coffee."</p>
<p>"I am not perhaps quite used to your American way of
breakfasting," he returned quickly.</p>
<p>"But you ate breakfasts when we first came," said the sweet girl
gently.</p>
<p>"Was not the weather cooler then?" he answered, "and I have
missed my walk this morning."</p>
<p>"Let me give you some more coffee, at any rate," said Sophie,
with affectionate interest. Indeed, I think at that moment she
absolutely loved him.</p>
<p>In a few minutes I escaped from the table; when I came down from
my room ready for church, I found that they were all just starting.
(Richard, I suppose, would have waited for me.) The church was in
the village, and not ten minutes' walk from the house. Kilian was
carrying Mary Leighton's prayer-book, and was evidently intending
to walk with her.</p>
<p>Richard came up to me and said, "Sophie is waiting to know if
you will let her drive you, or if you will walk."</p>
<p>I had not yet been obliged to speak to Richard since I had heard
what people said about us, and I felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Oh, let me drive if there is room," I said, without looking up.
Sophie sat in her little carriage waiting for me. Richard put me in
beside her, and then joined the others, while we drove away. Benny,
in his white Sunday clothes, sat at our feet.</p>
<p>"I think it is so much better for you to drive," said Mrs.
Hollenbeck, "for the day is warm, and I did not think you looked at
all well this morning."</p>
<p>"No," I said faintly. And she was so kind, I longed to tell her
everything. It is frightful at seventeen to have no one to tell
your troubles to.</p>
<p>At the gate Benny was just grumbling about getting out to open
it, when Mr. Langenau appeared, and held it open for us. He was
dressed in a flannel suit which he wore for walking. After he
closed the gate, he came up beside the carriage, as Mrs. Hollenbeck
very kindly invited him to do, by driving slowly.</p>
<p>"Are you coming with us to church, Mr. Langenau?" asked
Benny.</p>
<p>"To church? No, Benny. I am afraid they would not let me
in."</p>
<p>"Why, yes, they would, if you had your good clothes on," said
Benny.</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau laughed, a little bitterly, and said he doubted,
even then. "I am afraid I haven't got my good conscience on either,
Benny."</p>
<p>"But the minister would never know," said Benny.</p>
<p>"That's very true; the ministers here don't know much about
peoples' consciences, I should think."</p>
<p>"Do ministers in any other places know any more?" asked Benny
with interest.</p>
<p>"Why, yes, Benny, in a good many countries where I've been, they
do."</p>
<p>"You are a Catholic, Mr. Langenau?" asked Mrs. Hollenbeck.</p>
<p>"I once was; I have no longer any right to say it is my faith,"
he answered slowly.</p>
<p>"What is it to be a Catholic?" inquired Benny, gazing at his
tutor's face with wonder.</p>
<p>"To be a Catholic, is to be in a safe prison; to have been a
Catholic, is to be alone on a sea big and black with billows,
Benny."</p>
<p>"I think I'd like the prison best," said Benny, who was very
much afraid of the water.</p>
<p>"Ah, but if you couldn't get back to it, my boy."</p>
<p>"Well, I think I'd try to get to land somewhere," Benny
answered, stoutly.</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau laughed, but rather gloomily, and we went on for a
few moments in silence. The road was bordered with trees, and there
was a beautiful shade. The horse was very glad to be permitted to
go slow, not being of an ambitious nature.</p>
<p>All this time I had been leaning back, holding my parasol very
close over my face. Mr. Langenau happened to be on the side by me:
once when the carriage had leaned suddenly, he had put his hand
upon it, and had touched, without intending it, my arm.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," he had said, and that was all he had said
to me; and I had felt very grateful that Benny had been so inclined
to talk. I trusted that nobody would speak to me, for my voice
would never be steady and even again, I was sure, when he was by to
listen to it.</p>
<p>Now, however, he spoke to me: commonplace words, the same almost
that every one in the house had addressed to me that morning, but
how differently they sounded.</p>
<p>"I am sorry that you are not well to-day, Miss
d'Estr&eacute;e."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hollenbeck at this moment began to find some fault with
Benny's gloves, and leaning down, talked very obligingly and
earnestly with him, while she fastened the gloves upon his
hands.</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau took the occasion, as it was intended he should
take it, and said rather low, "You will not refuse to see me a few
moments this evening, that I may explain something to you?"</p>
<p>I think he was disappointed that I did not answer him, only
turned away my head. But I don't know in truth what other answer he
had any right to ask. He did not attempt to speak again, but as we
turned into the village, said, "Good-morning, I must leave you.
Good-bye, Benny, since I have neither clothes nor conscience fit
for church."</p>
<p>Sophie laughed, and said, at least she hoped he would be home
for dinner. He did not promise, but raising his hat struck off into
a little path by the roadside, that led up into the woods.</p>
<p>"What a pity," said Mrs. Hollenbeck musingly, "that a man of
such fine intellect should have such vague religious faith."</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau was at home for dinner, but he did not see me at
that meal, for my head ached so, and I felt so weary that when I
came up-stairs after church, it seemed impossible to go down again.
I should have been very glad to make the same excuse serve for the
remainder of the day, but really the rest and a cup of tea had so
restored me, that no excuse remained at six o'clock.</p>
<p>All families have their little Sunday habits, I have found; the
Sunday rule in this house was, to have tea at half-past six, and to
walk by the river till after the sun had set; then to come home and
have sacred music in the parlor. After tea, accordingly, we took
our shawls on our arms (it still being very warm) and walked down
toward the river.</p>
<p>I kept beside Mrs. Hollenbeck and Benny, where only I felt
safe.</p>
<p>The criticism I had heard had given me such a shock, I did not
feel that I ever could be careful enough of what I said and did.
And I vaguely felt my mother's honor would be vindicated, if I
showed myself always a modest and prudent woman.</p>
<p>"It was so well that I heard them," I kept saying to myself, but
I felt so much older and so much graver. My silence and constraint
were no doubt differently interpreted. Richard did not come up to
me, except to tell me I had better put my shawl on, as I sat on the
steps of the boat-house, with Benny beside me. The others had
walked further on and were sitting, some of them on the rocks, and
some on the boat that had been drawn up, watching the sun go
down.</p>
<p>"Tell me a story," said Benny, resting his arms on my lap, "a
story about when you were a little girl."</p>
<p>"Oh, Benny, that wouldn't make a pretty story."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, it would: all about your mamma and the house you used
to live in, and the children you used to go to see."</p>
<p>"Dear Benny! I never lived in but one old, dismal house. I never
went to play with any children. I could not make a story out of
that."</p>
<p>"But your mamma. O yes, I'm sure you could if you tried very
hard."</p>
<p>"Ah, Benny! that's the worst of all. For my mamma has been with
God and the good angels in the sky, ever since I was a little baby,
and I have had a dreary time without her here alone."</p>
<p>"Then I think you might tell me about God and the good angels,"
whispered Benny, getting closer to me.</p>
<p>I wrapped my arms around him, and leaning my face down upon his
yellow curls, told him a story of God and the good angels in the
sky.</p>
<p>Dear little Benny! I always loved him from that night. He cried
over my story: that I suppose wins everybody's heart: and we went
together, looking at the placid river and the pale blue firmament,
very far into the paradise of faith. My tears dropped upon his
upturned face; and when the stars came out, and we were told it was
time to go back to the house, we went back hand in hand, firm
friends for all life from that Sunday night.</p>
<p>"There is Mr. Langenau," said Benny; "waiting for you, I should
think."</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau was waiting for me at the piazza steps. He fixed
his eyes on mine as if waiting for my permission to speak again.
But I fastened my eyes upon the ground, and holding Benny tightly
by the hand, went on into the house.</p>

<h3>A DANCE.</h3>
<br>
<blockquote><b>It</b> is impossible to love and to be wise.<br>

<br>
Niente piu tosto se secca che lagrime.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>"This is what we must do about it," said Kilian, as we sat
around the breakfast-table. "If you are still in a humor for the
dance to-night, I will order Tom and Jerry to be brought up at
once, and Miss Pauline and I will go out and deliver all the
invitations."</p>
<p>"Of which there are about five," said Charlotte Benson. "You can
spare Tom and Jerry and send a small boy."</p>
<p>"But what if I had rather go myself?" he said, "and Miss Pauline
needs the air. Now there are--let me see," and he began to count up
the dancing inhabitants of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>"Will you write notes or shall we leave a verbal message at each
door?"</p>
<p>"Oh leave a verbal message by all means," said Charlotte Benson,
a little sharply. "It won't be quite <i>en r&egrave;gle</i>, as
Miss d'Estr&eacute;e doesn't know the people, but so unconventional
and fresh."</p>
<p>"I do know them," I retorted, much annoyed, "conventionally at
least: for they have all called upon me, though I didn't see them
all. But I shall be very glad if you will take my place."</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you; I wasn't moving an amendment for that end. We
have made our arrangements for the morning, irrespective of the
delivery of cards."</p>
<p>"I shall have time to write the notes first, if Sophie would
rather have notes sent," said Henrietta, who wrote a good hand and
was very fond of writing people's notes for them.</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you, dear; yes, perhaps it would be best, and save
Pauline and Kilian trouble."</p>
<p>So Henrietta went grandly away to write her little notes: a very
large ship on a very small voyage.</p>
<p>"And how about your music, Sophie," said Kilian, who was anxious
to have all business matters settled relating to the evening.</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose you had better go for the music-teacher from
the village; he plays very well for dancing, and it is a mercy to
me and to poor Henrietta, who would have to be pinned to the piano
for the evening, if we didn't have him."</p>
<p>"As to that, I thought we had a music-teacher of our own: can't
your German be made of any practical account? Or is he only to be
looked at and revered for his great powers?"</p>
<p>"I didn't engage Mr. Langenau to play for us to dance," said
Sophie.</p>
<p>"Nor to lounge about the parlor every evening either," muttered
Kilian, pushing away his cup of coffee.</p>
<p>"Now, Mr. Kilian, pray don't let our admiration of the tutor
drive you into any bitterness of feeling," cried Charlotte Benson,
who had been treasuring up a store of little slights from Kilian.
"You know he can't be blamed for it, poor man."</p>
<p>Kilian was so much annoyed that he did not trust himself to
answer, but rose from the table, and asked me if I would drive with
him in half an hour.</p>
<p>During the drive, he exclaimed angrily that Charlotte Benson had
a tongue that would drive a man to suicide if he came in hearing of
it daily. "Why, if she were as beautiful as a goddess, I could
never love her. Depend upon it, she'll never get a husband, Miss
Pauline."</p>
<p>"Some men like to be scolded, I have heard," I said.</p>
<p>"Well then, if you ever stumble upon one that does, just call me
and I'll run and fetch him Charlotte Benson."</p>
<p>The morning was lovely, and I had much pleasure in the drive,
though I had not gone with any idea of enjoying it. It was very
exhilarating to drive so fast as Kilian always drove; and Kilian
himself always amused me and made me feel at ease. We were very
companionable; and though I could not understand how young ladies
could make a hero of him, and fancy that they loved him, I could
quite understand how they should find him delightful and
amusing.</p>
<p>We delivered our notes, at more than one place, into the hands
of those to whom they were addressed, and had many pleasant talks
at the piazza steps with young ladies whom I had not known before.
Then we went to the village and engaged the music-teacher, stopped
at the "store" and left some orders, and drove to the Post-Office
to see if there were letters.</p>
<p>"Haven't we had a nice morning!" I exclaimed simply, as we drove
up to the gate.</p>
<p>"Capital," said Kilian. "I'm afraid it's been the best part of
the day. I wish I had any assurance that the German would be half
as pleasant. I beg your pardon, I don't mean your surly Teuton, but
the dance that we propose to-night; I wish it had another name.
Confound it! there he is ahead of us. (I don't mean the dance this
time, you see.) I wish he'd turn back and open the gate for us.
Holloa there!"</p>
<p>Kilian would not have dared call out, if the boys had not been
with their tutor. It was one o'clock, and they were coming from the
farm-house back to dinner. At the call they all turned; Mr.
Langenau stood still, and told Charles to go back and open the
gate.</p>
<p>Kilian frowned; he didn't like to see his nephew ordered to do
anything by this unpleasant German. While we were waiting for the
opening of the gate, the tutor walked on toward the house with
Benny. As we passed them, Benny called out, "Stop, Uncle Kilian,
stop, and take me in." Benny never was denied anything, so we
stopped and Mr. Langenau lifted him up in front of us. He bowed
without speaking, and Benny was the orator of the occasion.</p>
<p>"You looked as if you were having such a nice time, I thought
I'd like to come."</p>
<p>"Well, we were," said Kilian, with a laugh, and then we drove on
rapidly.</p>
<p>At the tea-table Mr. Langenau said to Sophie as he rose to go
away: "Mrs. Hollenbeck, if there is any service I can render you
this evening at the piano, I shall be very glad if you will let me
know."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hollenbeck thanked him with cordiality, but told him of the
provision that had been made.</p>
<p>"But you will dance, Mr. Langenau," cried Mary Leighton, "we
need dancing-men terribly, you know. Promise me you'll dance."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Charlotte Benson, "he has promised me." Mr. Langenau
bowed low; he got wonderfully through these awkward situations. As
he left the room Kilian said in a tone loud enough for us, but not
for him, to hear, "The Lowders have a nice young gardener; hadn't
we better send to see if he can't come this evening?"</p>
<p>"Kilian, that's going a little too far," said Richard in a
displeased manner; "as long as the boys' tutor conducts himself
like a gentleman, he deserves to be treated like a gentleman."</p>
<p>"Ah, Paterfamilias, thank you. Yes, I'll think of it," and
Kilian proposed that we should leave the table, as we all seemed to
have appeased our appetites and nothing but civil war could come of
staying any longer.</p>
<p>It was understood we had not much time to dress: but when I came
down-stairs, none of the others had appeared. Richard met me in the
hall: he had been rather stern to me all day, but his manner quite
softened as he stood beside me under the hall-lamp. That was the
result of my lovely white mull, with its mint of Valenciennes.</p>
<p>"You haven't any flowers," he said. Heavens! who'd have thought
he'd ever have spoken in such a tone again, after the cup of tea I
poured out for the tutor. "Let's go and see if we can't find some
in these vases that are fit, for I suppose the garden's
robbed."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, following him, quite pleased. For I could not
bear to have him angry with me. I was really fond of him, dear, old
Richard; and I looked so happy that I have no doubt he thought more
of it than he ought. He pulled all the pretty vases in the parlor
to pieces: (Charlotte and Henrietta and his sister had arranged
them with such care!) and made me a bouquet of ferns, and
tea-roses, and lovely, lovely heliotrope. I begged him to stop, but
he went on till the flowers were all arranged and tied together,
and no one came down-stairs till the spoilage was complete.</p>
<p>All this time Mr. Langenau was in the library--restless,
pretending to read a book. I saw him as we passed the door, but did
not look again. Presently we heard the sound of wheels.</p>
<p>"There," said Richard, feeling the weight of hospitality upon
him, "Sophie isn't down. How like her!"</p>
<p>But at the last moment, to save appearances, Sophie came down
the stairs and went into the parlor: indolent, favored Sophie, who
always came out right when things looked most against it.</p>
<p>In a little while the empty rooms were peopled. Dress improved
the young ladies of the house very much, and the young ladies who
came were some of them quite pretty: The gentlemen seemed to me
very tiresome and not at all good-looking. Richard was quite a king
among them, with his square shoulders, and his tawny moustache, and
his blue eyes.</p>
<p>There were not quite gentlemen enough, and Mrs. Hollenbeck
fluttered into the library to hunt up Mr. Langenau, and he
presently came out with her. He was dressed with more care than
usual, and suitably for evening: he had the <i>vive</i> attentive
manner that is such a contrast to most young men in this country:
everybody looked at him and wondered who he was. The music-teacher
was playing vigorously, and so, before the German was arranged,
several impetuous souls flew away in waltzes up and down the room.
The parlor was a very large room. It had originally been two rooms,
but had been thrown into one, as some pillars and a slight arch
testified. The ceiling was rather low, but the many windows which
opened on the piazza, and the unusual size of the room, made it
very pretty for a dance. Mary Leighton and the tutor were dancing;
somebody was talking to me, but I only saw that.</p>
<p>"How well he dances," I heard some one exclaim.</p>
<p>I'm afraid it must have been Richard whom I forgot to answer
just before: for I saw him twist his yellow moustache into his
mouth and bite it; a bad sign with him.</p>
<p>Kilian was to lead with Mary Leighton, and he came up to where
we stood, and said to Richard, "I suppose you have Miss Pauline for
your partner?"</p>
<p>Now I had been very unhappy for some time, dreading the moment,
but there was nothing for it but to tell the truth. So I said, "I
hope you are not counting upon me for dancing? You know I cannot
dance!"</p>
<p>"Not dance!" cried Kilian, in amazement; "why, I never dreamed
of that."</p>
<p>"You don't like it, Pauline?" said Richard, looking at me.</p>
<p>"Like it!" I said, impatiently. "Why, I don't know how; who did
I ever have to dance with in Varick-street? Ann Coddle or old
Peter? And Uncle Leonard never thought of such a thing as sending
me to school."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me before, and we wouldn't have bothered
about this stupid dance," said Kilian; but I think he didn't mean
it, for he enjoyed dancing very much.</p>
<p>Richard had to go away, for though he hated it, he was needed,
as they had not gentlemen enough.</p>
<p>The one or two persons who had been introduced to me, on going
to join the dance, also expressed regret. Even Mrs. Hollenbeck came
up, and said how sorry she was: she had supposed I danced.</p>
<p>But they all went away, and I was left by one of the furthest
windows with a tiresome old man, who didn't dance either, because
his legs weren't strong enough, and who talked and talked till I
asked him not to; which he didn't seem to like. But to have to
talk, with the noise of the music, and the stir, of the dancing,
and the whirl that is always going on in such a room, is penance. I
told him it made my head ache, and besides I couldn't hear, and so
at last he went away, and I was left alone.</p>
<p>Sometimes in pauses of the dance Richard came up to me, and
sometimes Kilian; but it had the effect of making me more
uncomfortable, for it made everybody turn and look at me. Bye and
bye I stole away and went on the piazza, and looked in where no one
could see me. I could not go away entirely, for I was fascinated by
the dance. I longed so to be dancing, and had such bitter feelings
because I never had been taught. After I left the room, I could see
Richard was uncomfortable; he looked often at the door, and was not
very attentive to his partner. No one else seemed to miss me. Mr.
Langenau talked constantly to Miss Lowder, with whom he had been
dancing, and never looked once toward where I had been sitting. A
long time after, when they had been dancing--hours it seemed to
me--Miss Lowder seemed to feel faint or tired, and Mr. Langenau
came out with her, and took her up-stairs to the dressing-room.</p>
<p>Ashamed to be seen looking in at the window, I ran into the
library and sat down. There was a student's lamp upon the table,
but the room had no other light. I sat leaning back in a large
chair by the table, with my bouquet in my lap, buttoning and
unbuttoning absently my long white gloves. In a moment I heard Mr.
Langenau come down-stairs alone: he had left Miss Lowder in the
dressing-room to rest there: he came directly toward the
library.</p>
<p>He came half-way in the door, then paused. "May I speak to you?"
he said slowly, fixing his eyes on mine. "I seem to be the only one
who is forbidden, of those who have offended you and of those who
have not."</p>
<p>"No one has said what you have," I said very faintly.</p>
<p>In an instant he was standing beside me, with one hand resting
on the table.</p>
<p>"Will you listen to me," he said, bending a little toward me and
speaking in a quick, low voice, "I did say what you have a right to
resent; but I said it in a moment when I was not master of my
words. I had just heard something that made me doubt my senses: and
my only thought was how to save myself, and not to show how I was
staggered by it. I am a proud man, and it is hard to tell you
this--but I cannot bear this coldness from you--and <i>I ask you to
forgive me</i>"</p>
<p>His eyes, his voice, had all their unconquerable influence upon
me. I bent over Richard's poor flowers, and pulled them to pieces
while I tried to speak. There was a silence, during which he must
have heard the loud beating of my heart, I think: at last he spoke
again in a lower voice, "Will you not be kind, and say that we are
friends once more?"</p>
<p>I said something that was inaudible to him, and he stooped a
little nearer me to catch it. I made a great effort and commanded
my voice and said, very low? but with an attempt to speak lightly,
"You have not made it any better, but I will forget it."</p>
<p>He caught my hand for one instant, then let it go as suddenly.
And neither of us could speak.</p>
<p>There is no position more false and trying than a woman's, when
she is told in this way that a man loves her, and yet has not been
told it; when she must seem not to see what she would be an idiot
not to see; when he can say what he pleases and she must seem to
hear only so much. I did no better and no worse than most women of
my years would have done. At last the silence (which did not seem a
silence to me, it was so full of new and conflicting thoughts,) was
broken by the recommencement of the music in the other room. He had
taken a book in his hands and was turning over its pages
restlessly.</p>
<p>"Why have you not danced?" he said at last, in a voice that
still showed agitation.</p>
<p>"I have not danced because I can't, because I never have been
taught."</p>
<p>"You? not taught? it seems incredible. But let me teach you.
Will you? Teach you! you would dance by intention. And would love
it--madly--as I did years ago. Come with me, will you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," I said, half frightened, shrinking back, "I am not
going to dance--ever."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that is as well," he said in a low tone, meeting my eye
for an instant, and telling me by that sudden brilliant gleam from
his, that then he would be spared the pain of ever seeing me
dancing with another.</p>
<p>"But let me teach you something," he said after a moment. "Let
me teach you German--will you?" He sank down in a chair by the
table, and leaning forward, repeated his question eagerly.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I should like it so much--if--."</p>
<p>"If--if what? If it could be arranged without frightening and
embarrassing you, you mean?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I wonder if you are not more afraid of being frightened and
embarrassed than of any other earthly trial. There are worse things
that come to us, Miss d'Estr&eacute;e. But I will arrange about the
German, and you need have no terror. How will I arrange? No
matter--when Mrs. Hollenbeck asks you to join a class in German,
you will join it, will you not?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes."</p>
<p>"You promise?"</p>
<p>"Oh, anything."</p>
<p>"Anything? take care. I may fill up a check for thousands, if
you give a blank."</p>
<p>"I didn't give a blank; anything about German's what I
meant."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's safer, but not half so generous. And yet you're one
who might be generous, I think."</p>
<p>"But tell me about the German class."</p>
<p>"I've nothing to tell you about it," he answered, "only that
you've promised to learn."</p>
<p>"But where are we to say our lessons, and what books are we to
Study?"</p>
<p>"Would you like to say a lesson now and get one step in advance
of all the others?"</p>
<p>"O yes! I shall need at least as much grace as that."</p>
<p>"Then say this after me: '<b>Ich will Alles lernen, was Sie mich
lehren</b>.' Begin. '<b>Ich will Alles lernen</b>'--"</p>
<p>"'<b>Ich will Alles lernen</b>'--but what does it mean?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that is not important. Learn it first. Can you not trust
me? '<b>Ich will Alles lernen, was Sie mich lehren.</b>'"</p>
<p>"'<b>Ich will Alles lernen</b>'--ah, you look as if my
pronunciation were not good."</p>
<p>"I was not thinking of that; you pronounce very well. '<b>Ich
will Alles lernen</b>--'"</p>
<p>"<b>Ich will Alles lernen, was Sie mich lehren</b>:--there
<i>now</i>, tell me what it means."</p>
<p>"Not until you learn it; <i>encore une fois</i>."</p>
<p>I said it after him again and again, but when I attempted it
alone, I made invariably some error.</p>
<p>"Let me write it for you," he said, and pulling a book from his
pocket, tore out a leaf and wrote the sentence on it. "There--keep
the paper and study it, and say it to me in the morning."</p>
<p>I have the paper still; long years have passed: it is only a
crumpled little yellow fragment; but the world would be poorer and
emptier to me if it were destroyed.</p>
<p>I had quite mastered the sentence, saying it after him word for
word, and held the slip of paper in my hand, when I heard steps in
the hall. I knew Richard's step very well, and gave a little start.
Mr. Langenau frowned, and his manner changed, as I half rose from
my seat, and as quickly sank back in it again.</p>
<p>"Is it that you lack courage?" he said, looking at me
keenly.</p>
<p>"I don't know what I lack," I cried, bending down my head to
hide my flushed face; "but I hate to be scolded and have
scenes."</p>
<p>"But who has a right to scold you and to make a scene?"</p>
<p>"Nobody: only everybody does it all the same."</p>
<p>"Everybody, I suppose, means Mr. Richard Vandermarck, who is
frowning at you this moment from the hall."</p>
<p>"And it means you--who are frowning at me this moment from your
seat."</p>
<p>All this time Richard had been standing in the hall; but now he
walked slowly away. I felt sure he had given me up. The people
began to come out of the parlor, and I felt ready to cry with
vexation, when I thought that they would again be talking about me.
It was true, I am afraid, that I lacked courage.</p>
<p>"You want me to go away?" he said, fixing his eyes intently on
me.</p>
<p>"O yes, if you only would," I said na&iuml;vely.</p>
<p>He looked so white and angry when he rose, that I sprang up and
put out my hand to stop him, and said hurriedly, "I only
meant--that is--I should think you would understand without my
telling you. A woman cannot bear to have people talk about her, and
know who she likes and who she doesn't. It kills me to have people
talk about me. I'm not used to society--I don't know what is
right--but I don't think--I am afraid--I ought not to have stayed
in here and talked to you away from all the others. It's that that
makes me so uncomfortable. That, and Richard too. For I know he
doesn't like to have me pleased with any one. Do not go away angry
with me. I don't see why you do not understand."</p>
<p>My incoherent little speech had brought him to his senses.</p>
<p>"I am not going away angry," he said in a low voice, "I will
promise not to speak to you again to-night. Only remember that I
have feelings as well as Mr. Richard Vandermarck."</p>
<p>In a moment more I was alone. Richard did not come near me, nor
seem to notice me, as he passed through the hall. Presently Mr.
Eugene Whitney came in, and I was very glad to see him.</p>
<p>"Won't you take me to walk on the piazza?" I asked, for
everybody else was walking there. He was only too happy; and so the
evening ended commonplace enough.</p>

<br>
<i>Surrey</i>.<br>
<br>
Love is not love<br>
That alters where it alteration finds.</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<p>This was how the German class was formed.</p>
<p>The next day, as we were leaving the dinner-table, Mr. Langenau
paused a few moments by Sophie, in the hall, and talked with her
about the boys.</p>
<p>"Charley gets on very well with his German," he observed, "but
Benny doesn't make much progress. He is too young to study much,
and acquires chiefly by the ear. If you only had a German maid, or
if you could speak with him yourself, he would make much better
progress."</p>
<p>"Yes, I wish I had more knowledge of the language," she replied;
"I read it very easily, but cannot speak with any fluency."</p>
<p>"Why will you never speak it with me?" he said. "And if you will
permit me, I shall be very glad to read with you an hour a day. I
have much leisure, and it would be no task to me."</p>
<p>"I should like it very much, and you are very kind. But it is so
hard to find an hour unoccupied, particularly with so many people
in the house, whom I ought to entertain."</p>
<p>"That is very true, unless you can make it a source of
entertainment to them. Miss Benson--is she not a German scholar?
She might like to join you."</p>
<p>Then, I think, the clever Sophie's mind was illuminated, and the
tutor's little scheme was revealed to her clear eye; she embraced
it with effusion. "An admirable idea," she said, "and the others,
too, perhaps, would join us if you would not mind. It would be one
hour a day at least secure from <i>ennui:</i> I shall have great
cause to thank you, if we can arrange it. For these girls get so
tired of doing nothing; my mind is always on the strain to think of
an amusement. Charlotte! Come here, I want to ask you
something."</p>
<p>Charlotte Benson came, and with her came Henrietta. I was
sitting on the sofa between the parlor-doors, and could not help
hearing the whole conversation, as they were standing immediately
before me.</p>
<p>"Mr. Langenau proposes to us to read an hour a day with him in
German. What do you think about it?"</p>
<p>"Charming," said Charlotte with enthusiasm. "I cannot think of
anything that would give me greater pleasure. Henrietta and I have
read in German together for two winters, and it will be enchanting
to continue it with such a master as Mr. Langenau."</p>
<p>Henrietta murmured her satisfaction, and then Charlotte rushed
into plans for the course, leaving me in despair, supposing I had
been forgotten. What place I was to find in such advanced society I
could not well imagine.</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau never turned his head in my direction, and talked
with Miss Benson with so much earnestness about the books into
which they were to plunge, that I could not convince myself that
all this was undertaken solely that he might teach me German. In a
little while they seemed to have settled it all to their
satisfaction, and he had turned to go away. My heart was in my
throat. Mrs. Hollenbeck had not forgotten me. She said something
low to Mr. Langenau.</p>
<p>"Ah, true!" he said. "But does she know anything of German?"
Then turning to me he said, with one of his dazzling sudden
glances, "Miss d'Estr&eacute;e, we are talking of making up a
German class; do you understand the language?"</p>
<p>"No," I said, meeting his eye for a moment, "I have only taken
one lesson in my life," and then blushed scarlet at my own
audacity.</p>
<p>"Ah," said he, as if quite sorry for the disappointment, "I wish
you were advanced enough to join us."</p>
<p>Then Charlotte Benson, quite ignoring the interruption, began to
ask him about a book that she wanted very much to find. Mr.
Langenau had it in his room--a most happy accident, and there was a
great deal said about it. I again was left in doubt of my fate.
Again Sophie interposed. "We have forgotten Mary Leighton," she
said, gently.</p>
<p>"Does Miss Leighton know anything of German?"</p>
<p>"Not a thing," said Henrietta.</p>
<p>"What does she know anything of, but flirting?" said Charlotte
with asperity, glancing out into the grounds where Kilian was
murmuring softest folly to her under her pongee parasol.</p>
<p>"Perhaps she'd like to learn," suggested Sophie. "She and
Pauline might begin together; that is, if Mr. Langenau would not
think it too much trouble to give them an occasional suggestion.
And you, Charlotte, I am sure, could help them a great deal."</p>
<p>Charlotte made no disguise of her disinclination to undertake to
help them.</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau expressed his willingness so unenthusiastically,
that I think Mrs. Hollenbeck was staggered. I saw her glance
anxiously at him, as if to know what really he might mean. She
concluded to interpret according to the context, however, and went
on.</p>
<p>"But it will be so much better for all to undertake it, if one
does. Suppose they try and see how it will work, either before or
after our lesson."</p>
<p>"<i>De tout mon coeur</i>," said Mr. Langenau, as if, however,
his <i>coeur</i> had very little interest in the matter.</p>
<p>"Well, about the hour?" said Charlotte, the woman of business;
"we haven't settled that after all our talking."</p>
<p>There was a great deal more, oh, a great deal more, and then it
was settled that five in the afternoon should be considered the
German hour--subject to alteration as circumstances should
arise.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hollenbeck very discreetly ordered that a beginning should
not be made till the next day but one. "The gentlemen will all be
here to-morrow, and there may be something else going on." I knew
very well she was afraid of Richard, and thought he would not
approve her zeal for our improvement.</p>
<p>The first lesson was very dull work for me. It was agreed that
Mary Leighton and I should take our lesson after the others,
sitting beside them, however, for the benefit of such crumbs of
information as might fall to us.</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau took no special notice of me then, and very little
that was flattering when Mary Leighton and I began our lesson
proper. Mrs. Hollenbeck, Charlotte, and Henrietta took up their
books and left, when the infant class was called. I do not think
Mr. Langenau took great pains to make the study of the German
tongue of interest to Miss Leighton. She was unspeakably bored, and
never even learned the alphabet. She was very much unused to mental
application, undoubtedly, and was annoyed at appearing dull. There
was but one door open to her; to vote German a bore, and give up
the class. She made her exit by that door on the occasion of the
second lesson, and Mr. Langenau and I were left to pursue our
studies undisturbed. The rendezvous was the piazza in fine weather,
and the library when it was damp or cloudy. The fidelity with which
the senior Germans gathered up their books and left, when their
hour was over, was mainly due to the kind thoughtfulness of Mrs.
Hollenbeck, who was always prompt, and always found some excuse for
carrying away Charlotte and Henrietta with her when she went.</p>
<p>It can be imagined what those hours were to me, those soft,
golden afternoons. Sometimes we took our books and went out under
the trees to some shaded seats, and sat there till the maid came
out to call us in to tea. Happy, happy hours in dreamland! But what
peril to me, and perhaps to him. It is vain to go over it all: it
is enough that of all the happy days, that hour from six o'clock
till tea-time was the happiest: and that with strange smoothness,
day after day passed on without bringing interruption to it. At six
the others went to ride or walk; I was never called, and did not
even wonder at it.</p>
<p>All this time Richard had been going every day to town and
coming back by the evening train. It was pretty tiresome work, and
he looked rather pale and worn; but I believe he could not stay
away. I sometimes felt a little sorry when I saw how much he was
out of spirits, but I was in such a happy realm myself, it did not
depress me long: in truth, I forgot it when he was not actually
before me, and sometimes even then. "I do not think you are
listening to what I say," he said to me one night as he sat by me
in the parlor. I blushed desperately, and tried to listen better.
Ah! how often it happened after that. I blush again to think how
much I pained him, and how silently he bore it all.</p>
<p>The last days of July were very busy ones in the Wall-street
office, and Richard did not give himself a holiday, till one
Saturday, much to be remembered, the very last day of the month. I
recall with penitence, the impatient feeling that I had when
Richard told me he was going to take the day at home. I felt
intuitively that it would spoil it all for me. After breakfast, we
all played croquet, and then I shut myself into my room with my
German books, and selfishly saw no one till dinner. At dinner I was
excited and half frightened, as I always was when Mr. Langenau and
Richard were both present, and both watching me; it was impossible
to please either.</p>
<p>Something was said about the afternoon, and Richard (who all
this time knew nothing of the German class) said to me, evidently
afraid of some other engagement being entered on, "I hope you will
drive with me, Pauline, at five. I ordered the horses when I was
down at the stables; I think the afternoon is going to be fine." It
was rather a public way of asking one out of so many to go and take
a drive; but in truth, Richard was too honest and straightforward
to care who knew what he was in pursuit of, and too sore at heart
and too indifferent an actor to conceal it if he had desired. But
the invitation struck me with such consternation. At five o'clock!
The flower and consummation of the day! The hour that I had been
looking forward to, since seven the day before. I could not lose
it. I would not go to drive. I hated Richard. I hated going to
drive. I grew very brave, and was on the point of saying that I
could not go, when I caught Sophie's eye. She made me a quick sign,
which I dared not disobey. I blushed crimson, and did not lift my
eyes again, but said in a low voice that I would go. Then my heart
seemed to turn to lead, and all the glory and pleasure of the day
was gone. It seemed to me of such vast importance, of such endless
duration, this penance that I was to undergo. O lovers! Foolish,
foolish men and women! I was like a child balked of its holiday; I
wanted to cry--I longed to get away by myself. I did not dare to
look at any one.</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau excused himself, and left the table before the
others went away. As we were leaving the table, Sophie, passing
close by me, said quite low, "I would not say anything about the
German class, Pauline. And it was a great deal better that you
should go; you know Richard has not many holidays."</p>
<p>"Yes, but you don't give up all your pleasures for him," I
thought, but did not say.</p>
<p>I went quickly to my room, and saw no one till I came
down-stairs at five o'clock. I had on a veil, for my face was
rather flushed, and my eyes somewhat the worse for crying. Richard
was waiting for me at the foot of the stairs, and accompanied me
silently to the wagon, which stood at the door. As we passed the
parlor I could see, on the east piazza, Mr. Langenau and Charlotte
already at their books. Both were so engrossed that they did not
look up as we went through the hall. For that, Richard, poor
fellow! had to suffer. I was too unreasonable to comprehend that
Mr. Langenau's absorbed manner was a covering for his pique. It was
enough torture to have to lose my lesson, without seeing him
engrossed with some one else, whose fate was happier than mine.
Perhaps, after all, he was fascinated by Charlotte Benson. She was
bright, clever, and understood him so well. She admired him so
much. She was, I was sure, half in love with him. (The day before I
had concluded she liked Richard very much.) That was a very
disagreeable drive. I complained of the heat. The sun hurt my
eyes.</p>
<p>"We can go back, if you desire it," said Richard, with a shade
of sternness in his voice, stopping the horses suddenly, after two
miles of what would have been ill-temper if we had been married,
but was now perhaps only petulance.</p>
<p>"I don't desire it," I said, quite frightened, "but I do wish we
could go a little faster till we get into the shade."</p>
<p>After that, there was naturally very little pleasure in
conversation. I felt angry with Richard and ashamed of myself. For
him, I am afraid his feelings were very bitter, and his silence the
cover of a sore heart. We had started to take a certain drive; we
both wished it over, I suppose, but both lacked courage to shorten
it, or go home before we were expected. There was a brilliant
sunset, but I am sure we did not see it: then the clouds gathered
and the twilight came on, and we were nearly home.</p>
<p>"Pauline," said Richard, hoarsely, not looking at me, and
insensibly slackening the hold he had upon the reins; "will you let
me say something to you? I want to give you some advice, if you
will listen to me."</p>
<p>"I don't want anybody to advise me," I said in alarm, "and I
don't know what right you have to expect me to listen to you,
Richard, unless it is that I am your guest; and I shouldn't think
that was any reason why I should be made to listen to what isn't
pleasant to me."</p>
<p>The horses started forward, from the sudden emphasis of
Richard's pull upon the reins; and that was all the answer that I
had to my most unjustifiable words. Not a syllable was spoken after
that; and in a few moments we were at the house. Richard silently
handed me out; if I had been thinking about him I should have been
frightened at the expression of his face, but I was not: I was only
thinking--that we were at home, and that I was going to have the
happiness of meeting Mr. Langenau.</p>

<h3>SOPHIE'S WORK.</h3>
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>This was what Sophie had done: she had invoked forces that she
could not control, and she felt, as people are apt to feel when
they watch their monster growing into strength, a little frightened
and a little sorry. No doubt it had seemed to her a very small
thing, to favor the folly of a girl of seventeen, fascinated by the
voice and manner of a nameless stranger; it was a folly most
manifest, but she had nothing to do with it, and was not
responsible; a very small thing to allow, and to encourage what,
doubtless, she flattered herself, her discouragement could not have
subdued. It was very natural that she should not wish Richard to
many any one; she was not more selfish than most sisters are. Most
sisters do not like to give their brothers up. She would have to
give up her home (one of her homes, that is,) as well. She did not
think Richard's choice a wise one: she was not subject to the
fascination of outline and coloring that had subjugated him, and
she felt sincerely that she was the best judge. If Richard must
marry (though in thinking of her own married life, she could not
help wondering why he must), let him marry a woman who had fortune,
or position, or talent. Of course there was a chance that this one
might have money, but that would be according to the caprice of a
selfish old man, who had never been known to show any affection for
her.</p>
<p>But money was not what Richard wanted: his sister knew much
better what Richard wanted, than he knew himself. He wanted a
clever woman, a woman who would keep him before the world and rouse
him into a little ambition about what people thought of him. Sophie
was disappointed and a little frightened when she found that
Richard did not give up the outline and coloring pleasantly. She
had thought he would be disillusionized, when he found he was
thrown over for a German tutor, who could sing. She had not counted
upon seeing him look ill and worn, and finding him stern and silent
to her; to her, of whom he had always been so fond. She found he
was taking the matter very seriously, and she almost wished that
she had not meddled with the matter.</p>
<p>And this German tutor--who could sing--well, it was strange, but
he was the worst feature of her Frankenstein, and the one at which
she felt most sorry and most frightened. Richard was very bad, to
be sure, but he would no doubt get over it: and if it all came out
well, she would be the gainer. As to "this girl for whom his heart
was sick," she had no manner of patience with her or pity for
her.</p>
<p>"She must suffer: so do all;" she would undoubtedly have a hard
future, no matter to which of these men who were so absurd about
her, Fate finally accorded her: hard, if she married Richard
without loving him (nobody knew better than Sophie how hard that
sort of marriage was); hard, if she married the German, to suffer a
lifetime of poverty and ill-temper and jealous fury. But about all
that, Sophie did not care a straw. She knew how much women could
live through, and it seemed to be their business to be
wretched.</p>
<p>But this man! And she could not gain anything by what he
suffered, with his dangerous nature, his ungovernable jealousy, his
possibly involved and unknown antecedents; what was to become of
him, in case he could not have this girl of whom six weeks ago he
had not heard? A pretty candidate to present to "mon oncle" of the
Wall-street office, for the hand of the young lady trusted to their
hospitality--a very pretty candidate--a German tutor--who could
sing. If he took her, it was to be feared he would have to take her
without more dowry than some very heavy imprecations. But could he
take her, even thus? Sophie had some very strange misgivings. This
man was desperately unhappy: was suffering frightfully: it made her
heart ache to see the haggard lines deepening on his face, to see
his colorless lips and restless eyes. She was sorry for him, as a
woman is apt to be sorry for a fascinating man. And then she was
frightened, for he was "no carpet knight so trim," to whom cognac,
and cigars, and time would be a balm: this man was essentially
dramatic, a dangerous character, an article with which she was
unfamiliar. He was frantic about this silly girl: that was plain to
see. Why then was he so wretched, seeing she was as irrationally in
love with him?</p>
<p>"If it only comes out right," she sighed distrustfully many
times a day. She resolved never to interfere with anything again,
but it came rather late, seeing she probably had done the greatest
mischief that she ever would be permitted to have a hand in while
she lived. She made up her mind not to think anything about it,
but, unfortunately for that plan, she could not get out of sight of
her work. If she had been a man, she would probably have gone to
the Adirondacks. But being a woman she had to stay at home, and sit
down among the tangled skeins which she had not skill to
straighten.</p>
<p>"If it only comes out right," she sighed again, the evening of
that most uncomfortable drive, "If it only comes out right." But it
did not look much like it.</p>
<p>I had gone directly in to tea, and so had Richard. Richard's
face silenced and depressed everybody at the table; and Mr.
Langenau did not come.</p>
<p>"There is going to be a terrible shower," said some one, and
before the sentence was ended, there was a vivid flash of lightning
that made the candles pale.</p>
<p>"How rapidly it has come up," said Sophie. "Was the sky black
when you came in, Richard?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," said Richard, and nobody doubted that he told
the truth.</p>
<p>"It had begun to darken before we came up from the river." said
Charlotte Benson. "The clouds were rising rapidly as we came in. It
will be a fearful tempest."</p>
<p>"Are the windows all shut?" said Sophie to the servant.</p>
<p>"I should think so," exclaimed Kilian. "The heat is horrid."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is suffocating," said Richard, getting up.</p>
<p>As he went out of the dining-room, some one, I think Henrietta,
said, "Well, I hope Mr. Langenau will get in safely; he was out on
the river when we were on the hill."</p>
<p>The storm was so sudden and so furious that everybody was
concerned at hearing this; even Kilian made some exclamation of
alarm.</p>
<p>"Does he know anything about a boat?" he asked of Richard, who
had paused in the doorway, hearing what was said.</p>
<p>"I have no idea," said Richard, shortly, but he did not go
away.</p>
<p>"It isn't the sail-boat that he has, of course," said Kilian,
thoughtfully. "He always goes out to row, I believe."</p>
<p>"Why, no," said Charlotte Benson, "he's in the sail-boat; don't
you remember saying, Henrietta, how bright the gleam of the sunset
was on the sail, and all the water was so dark?"</p>
<p>Kilian came to his feet very suddenly at these words.</p>
<p>"That's a bad business," he said quickly to his brother. "I've
no idea he can manage her in such a squall."</p>
<p>Sophie gave a little scream, and Charlotte and Henrietta both
grew very pale, as a frightful shock of thunder followed. The wind
was furious, and the unfastened shutters in various parts of the
house sounded like so many reports of pistols, and in an instant
the whole force of the rain fell suddenly and at once upon the
windows. Somewhere some glass was shattered, and all these sounds
added to the sense of danger, and the darkness was so great and so
sudden, that it was difficult to realize that half an hour before,
the sunset could have whitened the sails of a boat upon the
river.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's too late to do much now," said Kilian, stopping
in front of his brother in the doorway.</p>
<p>"What's the use of talking in that way," returned Richard in a
hoarse, low voice. "If you hav'nt more sense than to talk so before
women, you can stay at home with them," he continued, striding
across the hall, and picking up a lantern that stood in a corner
near the door. Charlotte Benson caught up one of the candles from
the table, and ran to him and lit the lamp within the lantern.
Sophie threw a cloak over Kilian's shoulders, and Henrietta flew to
carry a message to the kitchen. Richard pulled a bell that was a
signal to the stable (the stable was very near the house), and in
almost a moment's time two men, beside Kilian, were following him
out into the tempest. We saw their lanterns flicker for an instant,
and then they were swallowed up in the darkness. The fury of the
storm increased every moment. The flashes of lightning were but a
few seconds apart, and the roll of thunder was incessant. Every few
moments, above this continued roar, would come an appalling crash
which sounded just above our heads. The children were screaming
with fear, the servants had come into the hall and seemed in a
helpless sort of panic. Sophie was very pale and Mary Leighton
clung hysterically to her. Charlotte Benson was the only one who
seemed to be self-possessed enough to have done anything, if there
had been anything to do. But there was not. All we could do was to
try to behave ourselves with fortitude in view of the personal
danger, and with composure in view of that of others. Presently
there came a lull in the tempest, and we began to breathe freer;
some one went to the door and opened it. A gust of cold wind swept
through the hall and put out the lamp, at which the children and
Mary Leighton renewed their cries of fright.</p>
<p>The respite in the tempest was but temporary; before the lamp
was relit and order restored, the storm had burst again upon us.
This was, if anything, fiercer, but shorter lived. After fifteen or
twenty minutes' rage, it subsided almost utterly, and we could hear
it taking itself off across the heavens. I suppose the whole storm,
from its beginning to its end, had not occupied more than three
quarters of an hour, but it had seemed much longer.</p>
<p>We were very glad to open the door and let the cool, damp air
into the hall. The children were taken up-stairs, consoled with the
promise that word should be sent to them when their uncles should
return. The servants went feebly off to their domain; one was sent
to sweep the piazza, for the rain had beaten in such torrents upon
it that it was impossible to walk there, till it should be brushed
away. Wrapped in their shawls, Henrietta and Charlotte Benson
walked up and down the space that the servant swept, and watched
and listened for a long half-hour. I took a cloak from the rack
and, leaning against the door-post, stood and listened
silently.</p>
<p>From the direction of the river there was nothing to be heard.
There was still distant thunder, but that was the only sound, that
and the dripping of the rain off the leaves of the drenched trees.
The wind was almost silent, and in the spaces of the broken clouds
there were occasional faint stars. A fine, young tree, uprooted by
the tempest, lay across the carriage-way before the house, its
topmost branches resting on the steps of the piazza: the grass was
strewed with leaves like autumn, and the paths were simply pools of
water. Sophie, more than once, came to the door, and begged us to
come in, for fear of the dampness and the cold, but no one heeded
her suggestion. Even she herself came out very often, and looked
and listened anxiously. Finally my ear caught a sound: I ran down
the steps, and bent forward eagerly. There was some one coming
along the garden-path that led up from the river. I could hear the
water plashing as he walked, and he was coming rapidly. In a moment
the others heard it too, and starting to the steps, stood still,
and waited breathlessly. He had no lantern, for we could have seen
that; he was almost at the steps before I could recognize him. It
was Richard. I gave a smothered cry, and springing forward, held
out my hands to stop him.</p>
<p>"Tell me what has happened." He put aside my hands, and went
past me without a second look.</p>
<p>"There has nothing happened, but what he can tell you when he
comes," he said, as he strode past me up the steps, and on into the
house. Then he was alive to tell me: the reaction was a little too
strong for me, and I sat down on the steps to try and recover
myself, for I was ill and giddy.</p>
<p>In a few moments more, more steps sounded in the distance, this
time slowly, several persons coming together. I started and ran up
the steps, I don't exactly know why, and stood behind the others,
who were crowding down, servants and all, to hear what was the
news. Kilian came first, very drenched, and spattered, and subdued
looking, then Mr. Langenau, leaning upon one of the men, very pale,
but making an attempt to smile and speak reassuringly to Sophie,
who met him with looks of great alarm. It evidently gave him
dreadful pain to move, and when he reached the house he was quite
faint. Charlotte Benson placed a chair, into which they supported
him.</p>
<p>"Run, Pauline, and get some brandy," said Sophie, putting a
bunch of keys into my hand without looking at me.</p>
<p>When I came back with the glass of brandy, he was conscious
again, and looked at me and took the glass from my hand. The other
man had been sent for the doctor from the village, who was expected
every moment, and Mr. Langenau, who was now revived by stimulants,
was quite reassuring, and attempted to laugh at us for being so
much frightened. Then the young ladies' curiosity got the better of
their terror, and they clamored for the history of the past two
hours. This history was given them principally by Kilian. I cannot
repeat it satisfactorily, for the reason that I don't know anything
about jibs, and bowsprits, and masts, and centre-boards, and I did
not understand it at the time; but I received enough out of the
mass of evidence presented in that language, to be sure that there
had been considerable danger, and that everybody had behaved well.
In fact, Kilian's changed manner toward the tutor of itself was
quite enough to show that he had behaved unexpectedly well.</p>
<p>The unvarnished and unbowspritted and unjib-boomed tale was
pretty much as follows: Mr. Langenau had found himself in the
middle of the river, when the storm came on. I am afraid he could
not have been thinking very much about the clouds, not to have
noticed that a storm was rising; though every one agreed that they
had never known anything like the rapidity of its coming up. Before
he knew what he was about, a squall struck him, and he had great
difficulty to right the boat. (Then followed a good deal about
luffing and tacking and keeping her taut to windward; that is, I
think that was where he wanted to keep her.) But whatever it was,
he didn't succeed in doing it, and Kilian vouchsafed to say nobody
could have done it. Then something split: I really cannot say
whether it was the mast, or the bowsprit, or the centre-board, but
whatever it was, it hurt Mr. Langenau so much that for a moment he
was stunned. And then Kilian cannot see why he wasn't drowned. When
he came to himself he was still holding the rudder in his hand.</p>
<p>The other arm was useless from the falling of--this thing that
split--upon it. And so the boat was floundering about in the gale
till it got righted, and it was Mr. Langenau's presence of mind
that saved him and the boat, for he never let go the rudder, and
controlled her as far as he could, though he did not know where he
was going, the blackness was so great, and the flashes did not show
him the shore; and he was like one placed in the midst of a
frightful sea wakened out of a dream, owing to the blow and the
unconsciousness which followed.</p>
<p>Then Richard came upon the stage as hero; he and one of the men
had gone out in the only boat at hand, a very small one, toward the
speck, which, by the flashes of lightning, he saw out upon the
river. It was almost impossible to overhaul her, and it could not
have been done at the rate she was going, of course; but then
occurred that accident which rendered Mr. Langenau unconscious, and
which brought things to a standstill for a moment. Kalian said we
did not know anything about the storm up here at the house; that
more than one tree had been struck within a few feet of him on the
shore. The river was surging; the wind was furious; no one could
imagine what it was who had not witnessed it, and he, for his part,
never expected to see Richard come back to land. But Richard did
come back, and brought back the disabled sail-boat and the injured
man. That was the end of the story; which thrilled us all very
much, as we knew the heroes, and had one of them before us, ghastly
pale but uncomplaining.</p>
<p>It seemed as if the doctor never would come! We were women, and
we naturally looked to the coming of the doctor as the end of all
the trouble. It was impossible to make the poor fellow comfortable.
He could not lie down, he could not move without excruciating pain,
and very frequently he grew quite faint. Charlotte Benson and
Sophie administered stimulants; endeavored to ease his position
with pillows and footstools; and did all the nameless soothing acts
that efficient and good nurses alone understand; while I, paralyzed
and mute, stood aside, scarcely able to bear the sight of his
sufferings. I am sorry to say, I don't think he cared at all to
have me by him. He was in such pain that he cared only for the
attendance of those who could alleviate it in a measure; and the
strong firm hand and the skilled touch were more to him than the
presence of one who had nothing but excited and unavailing sympathy
to offer. It was rather a stern fact walking into my dreamland,
this.</p>
<p>By and bye Kilian went away to take off his wet clothes, and he
did not come back again, but sent down a message to his sister that
he was very tired and should go to bed, but if he were wanted for
anything he could be called. This was not heroic of Kilian, but,
after the manner of men, he was apt to keep away from the sight of
disagreeable things.</p>
<p>After all, he could not do much good, but it was something to
feel there was a man to call upon, besides Patrick, who was stupid;
and I saw Charlotte Benson's lip curl when Kilian's message was
brought down.</p>
<p>Richard was in his room: we all thought he had done enough for
one night, and had a right to rest.</p>
<p>At last, after the most weary waiting, wheels were heard, and
the doctor drove up to the door. The servants had begun to look
very sleepy. Mary Leighton had slipped away to her room, and Sophie
had told Henrietta and me to go, for we were really of no earthly
use. We did not take her advice as a compliment, and did not go.
Henrietta opened the door for the doctor, which was doing something
though not much, as two of the maids stood prepared to do it if she
did not.</p>
<p>The doctor was a reassuring, quiet man, and became a pillar of
strength at once. After talking a few moments with Mr. Langenau,
and pulling and twisting him rather ruthlessly, he walked a little
away with Sophie, and told her he wanted him got at once to his
room, and he should need the assistance of one of the gentlemen.
Would not Patrick do? Besides Patrick. Mr. Langenau's shoulder was
dislocated, badly, and it must be set at once. It was a painful
operation and he needed help. I was within hearing of this, and I
was in great alarm. Sophie looked so too, and I don't think she
liked disagreeable things any better than her brother, but she was
a woman, and could not shirk them as he could.</p>
<p>"Pauline," she said, finding me at her side as she turned, "run
up and tell Richard that he must come down, quick. Tell him how it
is, and that he must make haste."</p>
<p>I ran up the stairs breathlessly, but feeling all the time that
it was rather hard that I must be sent to Richard with this
message. Sophie did not want to ask him to come down herself, and
she thought me the most likely ambassador to bring him, but it was
not a congenial embassy. Perhaps, however, she only asked me
because I happened to be nearest her, and she was rather upset by
what the doctor said.</p>
<p>I knocked at Richard's door.</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Oh, they want you to come down-stairs a minute. There's
something to be done," panting and rather incoherent.</p>
<p>"What is to be done?"</p>
<p>"The Doctor's here, and he says he must have help."</p>
<p>"Where's Kilian?"</p>
<p>"Gone to bed."</p>
<p>Some suppressed ejaculation, and he pushed back his chair, and
rose, and came across the room: at least it sounded so, and I ran
down the stairs again. He followed me in a moment. The Doctor came
forward and talked to him a little while, and then Richard called
Patrick, and told Sophie to see that Mr. Langenau's room was
ready.</p>
<p>"How can he get up two pairs of stairs," said Charlotte Benson,
"when he cannot move an inch without such suffering?"</p>
<p>"That's very true," the Doctor said. "I doubt if he could bear
it. You have no room below?"</p>
<p>"Put a bed in the library," said Charlotte Benson, and in ten
minutes it was done; the servants no longer sleepy when they had
any definite order to fulfill.</p>
<p>"In the meantime," said Richard to his sister, "send those two
to bed," pointing out Henrietta and me.</p>
<p>"I've told them to go, but they won't," said Sophie, somewhat
sharply.</p>
<p>Henrietta walked off, rather injured, but I would not go.</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau had another faint attack, and I was quite certain
he would die. Charlotte was making him breathe <i>sal volatile</i>
and Sophie ran to rub his hands. The Doctor was busy at the light
about something.</p>
<p>"The room is all ready," said the servant.</p>
<p>"Very well; now Mr. Richard, if you please," the Doctor
said.</p>
<p>"Pauline," said Richard, coming to me as I stood at the foot of
the balusters, "You can't do any good. You'd better go
up-stairs."</p>
<p>"Oh, Richard," I cried, "I think you're very cruel; I think you
might let me stay."</p>
<p>I suppose my wretchedness, and youthfulness, and folly softened
him again, and he said, very gently, "I don't mean to be unkind,
but it is best for you to go. You need not be so frightened: there
isn't any danger."</p>
<p>I moved slowly to obey him, but turned back and caught his hand
and whispered, "You won't let them hurt him, Richard?" and then ran
up the stairs. No doubt Richard thought I went to my own room; but
I spent the next hour on the landing-place, looking down into the
hall.</p>
<p>It was rather a serious matter, getting Mr. Langenau even into
the library, and it was well they had not attempted his own room.
Patrick was called, and with his assistance and Richard's, he began
to move across the hall. But half-way to the library-door, he
fainted dead away, and Richard carried him and laid him on the bed,
Patrick being worse than useless, having lost his head, and the
Doctor being a small man, and only strong in science.</p>
<p>Pretty soon the library-door closed, and Sophie and Charlotte
were excluded. They walked about the hall, talking in low tones,
and looking anxious. Later, there came groaning from within the
closed door, and Charlotte Benson wrung her hands and listened. The
groans continued for a long while: the misery of hearing them!
After a while they ceased: then Richard opened the door, hastily,
it seemed, and called "Sophie."</p>
<p>Sophie ran forward, and the door closed again. There was a long
silence, time enough for those who were outside to imagine all
manner of horrid possibilities. Then the Doctor and Richard came
out.</p>
<p>"How is he, Doctor?" said Charlotte Benson, bravely, going to
meet them, while I hung trembling over the landing-place.</p>
<p>"Oh better, better, very comfortable," said the Doctor, in his
calm professional tone.</p>
<p>I could not help thinking those groans had not denoted a very
high state of comfort; but maybe the Doctor knew best how people
with dislocated shoulders and broken ribs are apt to express their
sentiments of satisfaction.</p>
<p>I listened with more than interest to their plans for the night:
the Doctor was going away at once; two of the servants and Patrick
were to relieve each other in sitting by him, while Richard was to
throw himself on the sofa in the hall, to be at hand if anything
were needed.</p>
<p>"Which means, that you are to be awake all night," said
Charlotte Benson. "You have more need of rest than we. Let Sophie
and me take your place."</p>
<p>Richard looked gratefully and kindly at her, but refused. The
Doctor assured them again that there was no reason for anxiety;
that Richard would probably be undisturbed all night; that he
himself would come early in the morning. Then Richard came toward
the stairs, and I escaped to my own room.</p>

<br>
<p>Two weeks later, and things had not stood still; they rarely do,
when there is so much at hand, and ripe for mischief; seventeen
does not take up the practice of wisdom voluntarily. I do not think
I was very different from other girls of seventeen, and I cannot
blame myself very much that I spent all these days in a dream of
bliss and folly; how could it have been otherwise, situated exactly
as we were? This is the way our days were passed. Mr. Langenau was
better, but still not able to leave his room. He was the hero, as a
matter of course, and little besides his sufferings, his condition,
and his prospects, was talked of at the table; which had the effect
of making Kilian stay away two nights out of three, and of
alienating Richard altogether. Richard went to town on Monday
morning after the accident occurred, and it was now Friday of the
following week, and he had not come back.</p>
<p>It was a little dull for Mary Leighton and for Henrietta,
perhaps; possibly for Charlotte Benson, but she did not seem to
mind it much; and I had never found R---- so enchanting as that
fortnight. Charlotte Benson liked to be Florence Nightingale in
little, it was very plain; and naturally nothing made me so happy
as to be permitted to minister to the wants of the (it must be
confessed) frequently unreasonable sufferer. For the first few
days, while he was confined to his bed, of course Charlotte and I
were obliged to content ourselves with the sending of messages, the
arranging of bouquets, the concocting of soups and jellies, and all
the other coddling processes at our command. But when Mr. Langenau
was able to sit up, Sophie (at the instance of Charlotte Benson,
for she seemed to have renounced diplomacy herself,) arranged that
the bed should be taken away during the daytime, and brought back
again at night, and that Mr. Langenau should lie on the sofa
through the day. This made it possible for us to be in the room,
even without Sophie, though we began to think her presence
necessary. That scruple was soon done away with, for it laid too
great a tax on her, and restricted our attentions very much. The
result was, we passed nearly the whole day beside him; Mary
Leighton and Henrietta very often of the party, and Sophie
occasionally looking in upon us. Sometimes when Charlotte Benson,
as ranking officer, decreed that the patient needed rest, we took
our books and work and went to the piazza, outside the window of
his room.</p>
<p>He would have been very tired of us, if he had not been very
much in love with one of us. As it was, it must have been a kind of
fool's paradise in which he lived, five pretty women fluttering
about him, offering the prettiest homage, and one of them the woman
for whom, wisely or foolishly, rightly or wrongly, he had conceived
so violent a passion.</p>
<p>As soon as he was out of pain and began to recover the tone of
his nerves at all, I saw that he wanted me beside him more than
ever, and that Charlotte Benson, with all her skill and cleverness,
was as nothing to him in comparison. No doubt he dissembled this
with care; and was very graceful and very grateful and infinitely
interesting. His moods were very varying, however; sometimes he
seemed struggling with the most unconquerable depression, then we
were all so sorry for him; sometimes he was excited and brilliant;
then we were all thrilled with admiration. And not unfrequently he
was irritable and quite morose and sullen. And then we pitied, and
admired, and feared him <i>&agrave; la fois</i>. I am sure no man
more fitted to command the love and admiration of women ever
lived.</p>
<p>Charlotte Benson with great self-devotion had insisted upon
teaching the children for two hours every day, so that Mr. Langenau
might not be annoyed at the thought that they were losing time, and
that Sophie might not be inconvenienced. It was the least that she
could do, she reasoned, after the many lessons that Mr. Langenau
had given us, with so much kindness, and without accepting a
return. Henrietta volunteered for the service, also, and from
eleven to one every day the boys were caught and caged, and made to
drink at the fountain of learning; or rather to approach that
fountain, of which forty Charlottes and Henriettas could not have
made them drink.</p>
<p>At that time Charlotte always decreed that Mr. Langenau should
lie on the sofa and go to sleep. The windows were darkened, and the
room was cleared of visitors. On this Friday morning, nearly two
weeks after the accident, as I was following Sophie from the room
(Charlotte having gone with Henrietta to capture the children), Mr.
Langenau called after me rather imperiously, "Miss
d'Estr&eacute;e--Miss Pauline--"</p>
<p>It had been a stormy session, and I turned back with misgivings.
Sophie shrugged her shoulders and went away toward the
dining-room.</p>
<p>"What are you going away for, may I ask?" he said, as I appeared
before him humbly.</p>
<p>"Why, you know you ought to lie down and to rest," I tried to
say with discretion, but it was all one what I said: it would have
irritated him just the same.</p>
<p>"I am rather tired of this surveillance," he exclaimed. "It is
almost time I should be permitted to express a wish about the
disposition of myself. As I do not happen to want to go to sleep, I
beg I may be allowed the pleasure of your society for a little
while."</p>
<p>"I don't think it would give you much pleasure, and you know you
don't feel as well to-day."</p>
<p>"Again, may I be permitted to judge how I feel myself?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, of course, but--"</p>
<p>"But what, Miss d'Estr&eacute;e?--No doubt you want to go
yourself--I am sorry I thought of detaining you (with a gesture of
dismissal). I beg you to excuse me, A sick man is apt to be
unreasonable."</p>
<p>"Oh, as to that, you know entirely well I do not want to go. You
are unreasonable, indeed, when you talk as you do now. I only went
away for your benefit."</p>
<p>"<i>Qui s'excuse, s'accuse</i>."</p>
<p>"But I am not excusing myself; and if you put it so I will go
away at once."</p>
<p>"<i>Si vous voulez</i>--"</p>
<p>"But I don't '<i>voulez</i>'--Oh, how disagreeable you can
be."</p>
<p>"You will stay?"</p>
<p>"Pauline!" called Sophie from across the hall.</p>
<p>"There!" I exclaimed, interpreting it as the voice of
conscience. I left my work-basket and book upon the table, and went
out of the room.</p>
<p>"You called me?" I said, following her into the parlor, where,
shutting the door, she motioned me to a seat beside her. She had a
slip of paper and an envelope in her hand, and seemed a little ill
at ease.</p>
<p>"I've just had a telegram from Richard," she said. "He's coming
home to-night by the eleven o'clock train. It's so odd altogether.
I don't know why he's coming. But you may as well read his message
yourself," she said with a forced manner, handing me the paper. It
was as follows:</p>
<p>Send carriage for me to eleven-thirty train to-night. Remember
my injunctions, our last conversation, and your promises."</p>
<p>"Well?" I said, looking up, bewildered and not violently
interested, for I was secretly listening to the quick shutting of
the library-door.</p>
<p>"Why, you see," she returned, with a forced air of confidence
that made me involuntarily shrink from her; I think she even laid
her hand upon my sleeve, or made some gesture of familiarity which
was unusual--</p>
<p>"You see, that last conversation was--about you. Richard is
annoyed at--at your intimacy with Mr. Langenau. You know just as
well as I do how he feels, for no doubt he's spoken to you
himself."</p>
<p>"He never has," I said, quite shortly.</p>
<p>"No?" and she looked rather chagrined. "Well--but at all events
you know how he feels. Girls ar'nt slow generally to find out about
those things. And he is really very unhappy about it, very. I wish,
Pauline, you'd give it up, child. It's gone quite far enough; now
don't you think so yourself? Mr. Langenau isn't the sort of man to
be serious about, you know. It's all very well, just for a summer's
amusement. But, you know, you mustn't go too far. I'm sure, dear,
you're not angry with me: now you understand just what I mean,
don't you?"</p>
<p>No: not angry, certainly not angry. She went on, still with the
impertinent touch upon my arm: "Richard made me promise that I
would look after you, and not permit things to go too far. And you
see--well--I'll tell you in confidence what I think his coming
to-night means, and his message and all. I think--that is, I am
afraid--he's found out something against Mr. Langenau since he's
been away. I know he never has felt confidence in him. But I've
always thought, perhaps that was because he was--well--a little
jealous and suspicious. You know men are so apt to be suspicious;
and I was sure, when he went away that last Monday morning, that he
would not leave a stone unturned in finding out everything about
him. It is that that's kept him, I am sure. Don't let that make you
feel hardly toward Richard," she went on, noticing perhaps my look;
"you know it's only natural, and besides, it's right. How would he
answer to your uncle?"</p>
<p>"It is I who should answer to my uncle," I returned, under my
breath.</p>
<p>"Yes, but you are in our house, in our care. You know, my dear
child, you are very young and very inexperienced; you don't know
how very careful people have to be."</p>
<p>"Why don't you talk that way to Charlotte and Henrietta and Mary
Leighton? Have I done anything so very different from them?" I
answered, with a blaze of spirit.</p>
<p>"No, dear," she said, with a little laugh, "only there are one
or two men very much in love with you, and that makes everything so
different."</p>
<p>I blushed scarlet, and was silenced instantly, as she
intended.</p>
<p>"Now, maybe I am mistaken about his having discovered
something," she went on, "but I can't make anything else out of
Richard's message. He is not one to send off such a despatch
without a reason. Evidently he is very uneasy; and I thought it was
best to be perfectly frank with you, dear, and I know you'll do me
the justice to say I have been, if Richard ever says anything to
you about it. You mustn't blame me, you know, for the way he feels.
I wish the whole thing was at an end," she said, with the first
touch of sincerity. "And now promise me one thing," with another
caressing movement of the hand, "Promise me, you won't go into the
library again till Richard comes, and we hear what he has to say.
Just for my sake, you know, my dear, for you see he would blame me
if I did not keep a strict surveillance. You won't mind doing that,
I'm sure, for me?"</p>
<p>"I shall not promise anything," I returned, getting up, "but I
am not likely to go near the library after what you've said."</p>
<p>"That's a good child," she said, evidently much relieved, and
thinking that the affair was very near its end. I opened the door,
and she added: "Now go up-stairs, and rest yourself, for you look
as if you had a headache, and don't think of anything that's
disagreeable." That was a good prescription, but I did not take
it.</p>
<p>Of course, I did not go near the library; that was understood.
After dinner, the servant brought in Mr. Langenau's tray untouched,
and Charlotte Benson started up, and ran in to see what was the
matter. Sophie went too, looking a little troubled. I think they
were both snubbed: for ten minutes after, when I met Charlotte in
the hall, she had an unusual flush upon her cheek, and Sophie I
found standing at one of the parlor-windows, biting her lip, and
tapping impatiently upon the carpet. Evidently the affair was not
as near its placid end as she had hoped. She started a little when
she saw me, and tried to look unruffled.</p>
<p>"How sultry it is this afternoon!" she said. "Are you going up
to your room to take a rest? stop in my room on your way, I want to
show you those embroideries that I was telling Charlotte Benson of
last night."</p>
<p>"I did not hear you, and I do not know anything about them," I
said, feeling not at all affectionate.</p>
<p>"No? Oh, I forgot: it was while you and Henrietta were sitting
in the library, and Charlotte and I were walking up and down the
piazza while it rained. Why, they are some heavenly sets that I got
this spring from Paris--Marshall picked them up one day at the
<i>Bon March&eacute;</i>--and verily they are <i>bon
march&eacute;</i>. I never saw anything so cheap, and I was telling
Charlotte that some of you might just as well have part of them,
for I never could use the half. Come up and look them over."</p>
<p>Now I loved "heavenly sets" as well as most women, but dress was
not the bait for me at that moment. So I said my head ached and I
could not look at them then, if she'd excuse me; and I went
silently away to my room, not caring at all if she were pleased or
not. I disliked and distrusted her more and more every moment, and
she seemed to me so mean: for I knew all her worry came from the
apprehension of what she might have to fear from Richard, not the
thought of the suffering that he or that any one else endured.</p>
<p>It was a long afternoon, but it reached its end, after the
manner of all afternoons on record, even those of Marianna. When I
came down-stairs they were all at tea and Kilian had arrived. A
more enlivening atmosphere prevailed, and the invalid was not
discussed. A drive was being canvassed. There was an early moon,
and Kilian proposed driving Tom and Jerry before the open wagon,
which would carry four, through the valley-road, to be back by
half-past nine or ten o'clock.</p>
<p>"But what am I to do," cried Kilian, "when there are five
angels, and I have only room for three?"</p>
<p>"Why, two will have to stay at home, according to my
arithmetic," said Charlotte, good-naturedly, "and I've no doubt I
shall be remainder."</p>
<p>"If you stay, I shall stay with you," said Henrietta, dropping
the metaphor, for metaphors, even the mildest, were beyond her
reach of mind.</p>
<p>Everybody wanted to stay, and everybody tried to be quite firm;
but as no one's firmness but mine was based on inclination, the
result was that Sophie and I were "remainder," and Mary Leighton,
Charlotte, and Henrietta drove away with Kilian quite jauntily, at
half-past seven o'clock. But before she went, Charlotte, who was
really good-natured with all her sharpness and self-will, went into
the library to speak to Mr. Langenau, and to show she did not
resent the noonday slight, whatever that had been. But presently
she came back looking rather anxious, and said to Sophie, ignoring
me (whom she always did ignore if possible),</p>
<p>"Do go and see what you can do for Mr. Langenau. He is really
very far from well. His tea stands there, and he hasn't taken
anything to eat. He looks feverish and excited, and I truly think
he ought to see the Doctor. You know he promised the Doctor to stay
in his room, and keep still all the rest of the week. But I am sure
he means to come out to-morrow, and he even talks of going down to
town. It will kill him if he does; I'm sure he's doing badly, and I
wish you'd go and see to him."</p>
<p>"Does he know Richard is coming up to-night?" asked Sophie,
<i>sotto voce</i>, but with affected carelessness.</p>
<p>"I do not know; oh yes, he does, I mentioned it to him at
dinner-time, I remember now."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll see if I can do anything for him; now go, they're
waiting for you. Have a pleasant time."</p>
<p>After they were gone, Sophie went into the library, but she did
not stay very long. She came and sat beside me on the
river-balcony, and talked a little, desultorily and
absent-mindedly.</p>
<p>Presently there was a call for "mamma," a hubbub and a
hurry--soon explained. Charley, who had been running wild for the
last two weeks, without tutor or uncle to control him, had just
fallen from the mow, and hurt himself somewhat, and frightened
himself much more. The whole house was in a ferment. He was taken
to mamma's room, for he was a great baby when anything was the
matter with him, and would not let mamma move an inch away from
him. After assisting to the best of my ability in making him
comfortable, and seeing myself only in the way, I went down-stairs
again, and took my seat upon the balcony that overlooked the
river.</p>
<p>The young moon was shining faintly, and the air was soft and
balmy. The house was very still; the servants, I think, were all in
a distant part of the house, or out enjoying the moonlight and the
idleness of evening. Sophie was nailed to Charley's bed up-stairs,
trying to soothe him; Benny was sinking to sleep in his little
crib. It seemed like an enchanted palace, and when I heard a step
crossing the parlor, it made me start with a vague feeling of
alarm. The parlor-window by me, which opened to the floor, was not
closed, and in another moment some one came out and stood beside
me. It was Mr. Langenau. I started up and exclaimed, "Mr. Langenau,
how imprudent! Oh, go back at once."</p>
<p>He seemed weak, and his hand shook as he leaned against the
casement, but his eyes were glittering with a feverish excitement.
He did not answer. I went on: "The Doctor forbade your coming out
for several days yet--and the exertion and the night-air--oh, I beg
you to go back."</p>
<p>"Alone?" he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>"No, oh no, I will go with you. Anything, only do not stay here
a moment longer; come." And taking his hand (and how burning hot it
was!) and drawing it through my arm, I started toward the hall. He
had to lean on me, for the unusual exertion seemed to have
annihilated all his strength. When we reached the library, I led
him to a chair--a large and low and easy one, and he sank down in
it.</p>
<p>"You are not going away?" he asked, as he gasped for breath,
"For there is something that must be said to-night."</p>
<p>"No, I will not go," I answered, frightened to see him so, and
agitated by a thousand feelings. "I will light the lamp, and read
to you. Let me move your chair back from the window."</p>
<p>"No, you must not light the lamp; I like the moonlight better.
Bring your chair and sit here by me--here." He leaned and
half-pulled toward him the companion to the chair on which he sat,
a low, soft, easy one.</p>
<p>I sat down in it, sitting so I nearly faced him. The moon was
shining in at the one wide window: I can remember exactly the
pattern that the vine-leaves made as the moonlight fell through
them on the carpet at our feet. I had a bunch of verbena-leaves
fastened in my dress, and I never smell verbena-leaves at any time
or place without seeing before me that moon-traced pattern and that
wide-open window.</p>
<p>"Pauline," he said, in that low, thrilling voice, leaning a
little toward me, "I have a great deal to say to you to-night. I
have a great wrong to ask pardon for--a great sorrow to tell you
of. I shall never call you Pauline again as I call you to-night. I
shall never look into your eyes again, I shall never touch your
hand. For we must part, Pauline; and this hour, which heaven has
given me, is the last that we shall spend together on the
earth."</p>
<p>I truly thought that his fever had produced delirium, and,
trying to conceal my alarm, I said, with an attempt to quiet him,
"Oh, do not say such things; we shall see each other a great, great
many times, I hope, and have many more hours together."</p>
<p>"No, Pauline, you do not know so well as I of what I speak. This
is no delirium; would to heaven, it were, and I might wake up from
it. No, the parting must be said to-night, and I must be the one to
speak it. We may spend days, perhaps, under the same roof--we may
even sit at the same table once again; but, I repeat, from this day
I may never look into your eyes again, I may never touch your hand.
Pauline, can you forgive me? I know that you can love. Merciful
Heaven! who so well as I, who have held your stainless heart in my
stained hand these many dreamy weeks; and Justice has not struck me
dead. Yes, Pauline, I know you've loved me; but remember this one
thing, in all your bitter thoughts of me hereafter: remember this,
you have not loved me as I have loved you. You have not given up
earth and heaven both for me as I have done for you. For you? No,
not for you, but for the shadow of you, for the thought of you, for
these short weeks of you. And then, an eternity of absence, and of
remorse, and of oblivion--ah, if it might be oblivion for you! If I
could blot out of your life this short, blighting summer; if I
could put you back to where you were that fresh, sweet morning that
I walked with you beside the river! I loved you from that day,
Pauline, and I drugged my conscience, and refused to heed that I
was doing you a wrong in teaching you to love me. Pauline, I have
to tell you a sad story: you will have to go back with me very far;
you will have to hear of sins of which you never dreamed in your
dear innocence. I would spare you if I could, but you must know,
for you must forgive me. And when you have heard, you may cease to
love, but I think you will forgive. Listen."</p>
<p>Why should I repeat that terrible disclosure? why harrow my soul
with going back over that dark path? Let me try to forget that such
sins, such wrongs, such revenges, ever stained a human life. I was
so young, so innocent, so ignorant. It was a strange misfortune
that I should have had to know that which aged and changed me so.
But he was right in saying that I had to know it. My life was bound
involuntarily to his by my love, and what concerned him was my
fate. Alas! He was in no other way bound to me than by my love: nor
ever could be.</p>
<p>I don't know whether I was prepared for it or not: I knew that
something terrible and final was to come, and I felt the awe that
attends the thoughts that words are final and time limited. But
when I heard the fatal truth--that another woman lived to whom he
was irrevocably bound--I heard it as in a dream, and did not move
or speak. I think I felt for a moment as if I were dead, as if I
had passed out of the ranks of the living into the abodes of the
silent, and benumbed, and pulseless. There was such a horrible awe,
and chill, and check through all my young and rapid blood. It was
like death by freezing. It is not so pleasant as they say, believe
me. But no pain: that came afterward, when I came to life, when I
felt the touch of his hand on mine, and ceased to hear his cruel
words.</p>
<p>I had shrunk back from him in my chair, and sat, I suppose, like
a person in a trance, with my hands in my lap, and my eyes fixed on
him with bewilderment. But when he ceased to speak--and, leaning
forward on one knee, clasped my hands in his, and drew me toward
him, then indeed I knew I was not dead. Oh, the agony of those few
moments--I tried to rise, to go away from him. But he held me with
such strength--all his weakness was gone now. He folded his arms
around my waist and held me as in a vise. Then suddenly leaning his
head down upon my arms, he kissed my hands, my arms, my dress, with
a moan of bitter anguish.</p>
<p>"Not mine," he murmured. "Never mine but in my dreams. O
wretched dreams, that drive me mad. Pauline, they will tell us that
we must not dream--we must not weep, we must be stocks and stones.
We must wear this weight of living death till that good Lord that
makes such laws shall send us death in mercy. Twenty, thirty,
forty, fifty years of suffering: that might almost satisfy Him, one
would think. Pauline! you and I are to say good-bye to-night.
Good-bye! People talk of it as a cruel word. Think of it: if it
were but for a year, a year with hope at the end of it to keep our
hearts alive, it would be terrible, and we should need be brave.
The tears that lovers shed over a year apart; the days that have
got to come and go, how weary. The nights--the nights that sleep
flies off from, and that memory reigns over. Count them--over three
hundred come in every year. One, you think while it is passing, is
enough to kill you: one such night of restless torture, and how
many shall we multiply our three hundred by? We are young, Pauline.
You are a child, a very child. I am in the very flush and strength
of manhood. There is half a century of suffering in me yet: this
frame, this brain, will stand the wear of the hard years to come
but too, too well. There is no hope of death. There is no hope in
life. That star has set. Good God! And that makes hell--why should
I wait for it--it cannot be worse there than here. Don't listen to
me--it will not be as hard for you--you are so young--you have no
sins to torture you--only a little love to conquer and forget. You
will marry a man who lives for you, and who is patient and will
wait till this is over. Ah, no: by Heaven! I can't quite stand it
yet. Pauline, you never loved him, did you--never blushed for
him--never listened for his coming with your lips apart and your
heart fluttering, as I have seen you listen when you thought that I
was coming? No, I know you never loved him: I know you have loved
me alone--me--who ought to have forbidden you.
Forgive--forgive--forgive me."</p>
<p>A passion of tears had come to my relief, and I shook from head
to foot with sobs. I cannot feel ashamed when I remember that he
held me for one moment in his arms. He had been to me till that
shock, strength, truth, justice: <i>the man I loved</i>. How could
I in one instant know him by his sin alone, and undo all my trust?
I knew only this, that it was for the last time, and that my heart
was broken.</p>
<p>I forgave him--that was an idle form; in my great love I never
felt that there was anything to be forgiven, except the wrong that
fate had done me, in making my love so hopeless. He told me to
forget him; that seemed to me as idle; but all his words were
precious, and all my soul was in his hand. When, at that moment,
the sound of wheels upon the gravel came, and the sound of laughter
and of voices, I sprang up; he caught me in his arms and held me
closely. Another moment, the parting was over, and I was kneeling
by my bed up-stairs, weeping, sobbing, hopeless.</p>

On my restless bed, unsightly,<br>
&nbsp;I sat up in my sorrow.<br>
<br>
<i>Faust.</i></blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<p>It is an amazing thing, the strength and power of pride. Pride,
and the law of self-respect and self-preservation in our being, is
the force that holds us in our course. When we reflect upon it, how
few of all the myriads fly out from it and are lost. That I ate my
meals; that I dressed myself with care; that I took walks and
drives: that I did not avoid my companions, and listened patiently
to what they chose to say: these were the evidences of that
centripetal law within that was keeping me from destruction. It
would be difficult to imagine a person more unhappy. Undisciplined
and unfortified by the knowledge that disappointment is an integral
part of all lives, there had suddenly come upon me a disappointment
the most total. It covered everything; there was not a flicker of
hope or palliation. And I had no idea where to go to make myself
another hope, or in what course lay palliation. As we have prepared
ourselves or have been prepared, so is the issue of our
temptations. My great temptation came upon me, foolish, ignorant,
unprepared: the wonder would have been if I had resisted it to my
own credit.</p>
<p>The days went on as usual at R----, and I must hold my place
among the careless daughters and not let them see my trouble.
Careless daughters, indeed they were, and I shuddered at the
thought of their cold eyes: no doubt their eyes, bright as well as
cold, saw that something was amiss with me; with all my bravery, I
could not keep the signs of wretchedness out of my pale face. But
they never knew the story, and they could only guess at what made
me wretched. It is amazing (again) what power there is in silence,
and how much you can keep in your hands if you do not open them.
People may surmise--may invent, but they cannot know your secret
unless you tell it to them, and their imaginings take so many
forms, the multitude of things that they create blot out all
definite design. Thus every one at R---- had a different theory
about my loss of spirits and the relapse of Mr. Langenau, but no
one ever knew what passed that night.</p>
<p>Richard came. He was closeted with Sophie until after midnight,
but I do not think he told her anything that she desired to know. I
think he only tried to find out from her what had passed (and she
did not know that I had been in the library since she spoke to me).
If Mr. Langenau had been well, I have no doubt that it was his
design to have dismissed him on the following day, no matter at
what hazard. How much he knew I cannot tell, but enough to have
warranted him in doing that, perhaps. He probably would have put it
in Mr. Langenau's power to have gone without any coloring put upon
his going that would have affected his standing in the household.
This was his design, no doubt; otherwise he would have told his
sister all. His delicate consideration for me made him guard as
sacred the fact that I had wasted my hope and love so cruelly.</p>
<p>He was not going away again, I soon found; <i>qui va &agrave; la
chasse perd sa place</i>. He had lost his place, but he would stay
and guard me all the same; and the chase for gold seemed given up
for good and all.</p>
<p>Kilian was in constant surprise, and made out many catechisms,
but he got little satisfaction.</p>
<p>Richard was going to have a few weeks' "rest," unless something
should occur to call him back to town.</p>
<p>He sought no interview with me, was kind and silent, but his eye
was never off me. I think he watched his opportunity for saying
what he had to say to Mr. Langenau, but such an opportunity seemed
destined not to come.</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau was ill the day after Richard came home--quite ill
enough to cause alarm. He had a high fever, and the Doctor even
seemed uneasy, and prescribed the profoundest quiet. After a day or
two, however, he improved, and all danger seemed averted.</p>
<p>As soon as he was strong enough, he was to be removed to his own
room above, for the sake of quiet, and to release the household
from its enforced tranquillity.</p>
<p>All these particulars I heard at table, or from morning groups
on the piazza: with stony cheeks, and eyes that looked
unflinchingly into all curious faces: so works the law of
self-defence.</p>
<p>All but Richard, I am sure, were staggered, but he read with his
heart.</p>
<p>I never blushed now, I never faltered, I never said a word I did
not mean to say. It was a struggle for life: though I did not value
the life, and should have found it hard to say why I did not give
up and let them see that I was killed.</p>
<p>But I kept wondering how I should sustain myself if I should be
called upon to meet him once again.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>"Mr. Langenau is coming down to-day," said Charlotte Benson in a
stage-whisper, as we took our places at the table, a week after
this. "I met him in the hall about an hour ago, looking like a
ghost, and he told me he was coming down to dinner."</p>
<p>"<i>Vraiment</i>," said Sophie, looking a little disconcerted.
"Well, he shall have Charley's place. Charley isn't coming."</p>
<p>"I hope he's in a better temper than that last day we saw him,"
said Henrietta.</p>
<p>"Poor fellow!" said Charlotte, "that was the day before the
fever began. It was coming on: that was the reason of it all, no
doubt. He looks ghastly enough now. You'll forgive all, the moment
that you see him."</p>
<p>Charlotte had forgiven him herself, though she had never resumed
the role of Florence Nightingale. Since he had given up the library
and removed to his own room, he had been quite lost to all, and
nobody seemed to have gone near him, not even Sophie, who would
have been glad to forget that he existed, without doubt.</p>
<p>Richard's eyes were on me as Charlotte said "Hush!" and a step
crossed the hall in the pause that ensued. Kilian, sitting next me,
began to talk to me at that moment, the moment that Mr. Langenau
entered the room. And I think I answered quite coherently: though
two sets of words were going through my brain, the answer to his
commonplace question, and the words that Mr. Langenau had said that
night, "Pauline, I shall never look into your eyes again, I shall
never touch your hand."</p>
<p>It seemed to me an even chance which sentence saw the day; but
as the walls did not fall down about me and no face looked
amazement, I found I must have answered Kilian's question with
propriety.</p>
<p>There were many voices speaking at once; but there was such a
ringing in my ears, I could not distinguish who spoke, or what was
said: for a moment I was lost, if any one had taken advantage of
it. But gradually I regained my senses: one after another they each
took up their guard again: and I looked up. And met his eyes? No;
but let mine rest upon his face. And then I found I had not
measured my temptation, and that there was something to do besides
defending myself from others' eyes. For there was to defend myself
from my own heart. The passion of pity and tenderness that rushed
over me as my eyes fell on his haggard face, so strong and yet so
wan, swept away for the moment the defences against the public
gaze. I could have fallen down at his feet before them all and told
him that I loved him.</p>
<p>A few moments more of the sound of commonplace words, and the
repulsion of every-day faces and expressions, swept me back into
the circle of conventionalities, and brought me under the force of
that current that keeps us from high tragedy.</p>
<p>All during the meal Mr. Langenau was grave and silent, speaking
little and then with effort. He had overrated his strength,
perhaps, for he went away before the end of the dinner, asking to
be excused, in a tone almost inaudible. After he had gone, a good
many commentaries were offered. Kilian seemed to express the sense
of the assembly when he said: "The man looks shockingly, and he's
not out of the woods yet."</p>
<p>Sophie looked troubled: she had some compunctions for the
neglect of the last few days, perhaps.</p>
<p>"What does the Doctor say?" pursued her brother.</p>
<p>"Nothing, I suppose--for he hasn't been here for a week,
almost."</p>
<p>"Well, then, you'd better send for him, if you don't want the
fellow to die on your hands. He's not fit to be out of bed, and
you'll have trouble if you don't look out."</p>
<p>"As if I hadn't had trouble," returned his sister, almost
peevishly.</p>
<p>"Well, I beg your pardon, Sophie. But I fancied you and Miss
Charlotte were in charge; and I thought about ten days ago, your
patient was in a fair way to be killed with kindness, and it's a
little of a surprise to me to find he's being let alone so very
systematically."</p>
<p>"Why, to tell you the truth," cried Charlotte Benson, "we were
turned out of office without much ceremony, one fine day after
dinner. I am quite willing to be forgiving; but I don't think you
can ask me to put myself in the way of being snubbed again to that
extent."</p>
<p>"The ungrateful varlet! what did he complain of? Hadn't he been
coddled enough to please him? Did he want four or five more women
dancing attendance on him?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it was not want of attention he complained of. In fact,"
said Charlotte, coloring, "It was that he didn't like quite so
much, and wanted to be allowed more liberty."</p>
<p>Kilian indulged in a good laugh, which wasn't quite fair,
considering Charlotte's candor.</p>
<p>"But the truth is," said Charlotte, uneasily, "that he was too
ill, that day, to be responsible for what he said. He was just
coming down with the fever, and, you know, people are always most
unreasonable then."</p>
<p>"I'm very glad I never gave him a chance to dispense with me,"
said Mary Leighton, with a view to making herself amiable in
Kilian's eyes.</p>
<p>"I think he dispensed with you early in the season," said
Charlotte, sharply. "Oh, hast thou forgotten that walk that he
took, upon your invitation? Ah, Miss Leighton, his look was quite
dramatic. I know you never have forgiven him."</p>
<p>"I haven't the least idea what you are talking of," returned
Mary Leighton, with bewildered and child-like simplicity.</p>
<p>"Ah, then it was not as unique an occurrence as I hoped," said
Charlotte, viciously. "I imagined it would make more of an
impression."</p>
<p>"Charlotte," interrupted Sophie, shocked at this open
impoliteness, "I hope you are forgiving enough to break it to him
that he's got to see the Doctor; for if he comes unexpectedly and
goes up to his room, he will be dramatic, and that is so
unpleasant, as we know to our sorrow."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I shan't tell him," cried Charlotte, "you can take your
life in your hand, and try it if you please; but I cannot consent
to risk myself. There's Mary Leighton, she bears no malice. Perhaps
she'll go with you as support."</p>
<p>"Ha, ha!" cried Kilian. "Richard, you and I may be called on to
bring up the rear. There's the General's old sword in the hall, and
I'll take the Joe Manton from the shelf in the library."</p>
<p>"Richard looks as if he disapproved of us all very much," said
Sophie, and in truth Richard did look just so. He did not even
answer these suggestions, but began after a moment to talk to
Henrietta on indifferent matters.</p>
<p>It was on this afternoon that a new policy was inaugurated at
R----. We were taught to feel that we had been quite aggrieved by
the dullness of the past two weeks or more, and that we must be
compensated by some refreshing novelties.</p>
<p>Richard was at the head of the movement--Richard with his sober
cares and weary look. But the incongruity struck no one; they were
too glad to be amused. Even Sophie brightened up. Charlotte was
ready to throw her energies into any active scheme, hospital or
picnic, charity-school or kettle-drum.</p>
<p>"To-morrow will be just the sort of day for it," said Richard,
"cool and fine. And half the pleasure of a picnic is not having
time to get tired of it beforehand."</p>
<p>"That's very true," said Charlotte; "but I don't see how we're
going to get everybody notified and everything in order for nine
o'clock to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>"Nothing easier," said Kilian; "we'll go, directly after tea, to
the De Witts and Prentices, and send Thomas with a note to the
Lowders. Sophie has done her part in shorter time than that, very
often; and I don't believe we should be starved, if she only gave
half an hour's notice to the cook."</p>
<p>What is heavier than pleasure-seeking in which one has no
pleasure? I shall never forget the misery of those plans and that
bustle. I dared not absent myself, and I could scarcely carry out
my part for very heavy-heartedness. It seemed to me that I could
not bear it, if the hour came, and I should have to drive away with
all that merry party, and leave poor Mr. Langenau for a long, long
day alone.</p>
<p>I felt sure something would occur to release me: it could not be
that I should have to go. With the exaggeration of youth, it seemed
to me an impossibility that I could endure anything so grievous.
How I hated all the careless, thoughtless, happy household! Only
Richard, enemy as he was to my happiness, seemed endurable to me.
For Richard was not merry-making in his heart, and I was sure he
was sorry for me all the time he was trying to oppose me.</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau was again in the Doctor's care, who came that
evening, and who said to Richard, in my hearing, he must be kept
quiet; he didn't altogether like his symptoms.</p>
<p>Richard had his hands full, with great matters and small. Sophie
had washed hers of the invalid; there had been some sharpish words
between the sister and brother on the matter, I imagine, and the
result was, Richard was the only one who did or would do anything
for his comfort and safety.</p>
<p>That day, after appearing at dinner, he came no more. I watched
with feverish anxiety every step, every sound; but he came not. I
knew that the Doctor's admonitions would not have much weight, nor
yet Richard's opinion. I had the feeling that if he would only
speak to me, only look at me once, it would ease that horrible
oppression and pain which I was suffering. The agony I was enduring
was so intolerable, and its real relief so impossible, like a child
I caught at some fancied palliation, and craved only that. What
would one look, one word be--out of a lifetime of silence and
separation.</p>
<p>No matter: it was what I raged and died for, just one look, just
one word more. He had said he would never look into my eyes again:
that haunted me and made me superstitious. I would <i>make</i> him
look at me. I would seize his hand and kneel before him, and tell
him I should die if he did not speak to me once more. Once more!
Just once, out of years, out of forever. I had thrown duty,
conscience, thought to the winds. I had but one fear--that we
should be finally separated without that word spoken, that look
exchanged. I said to myself again and again, I shall die, if I
cannot speak to him again. Beyond that I did not look. What better
I should be after that speaking I did not care. I only longed and
looked for that as a relief from the insufferable agony of my fate.
One cannot take in infinite wretchedness: it is our nature to make
dates and periods to our sorrows in our imagination.</p>
<p>And so that horrid afternoon and evening passed, amid the racket
and babel of visitors and visiting. I followed almost blindly, and
did as the others did. The next morning dawned bright and cold.
What a day for summer! The sun was brilliant, but the wind came
from over icebergs; it seemed like "winter painted green."</p>
<p>We were to start at nine o'clock. I was ready early, waiting on
the piazza for the aid to fate that was to keep me from the
punishment of going. No human being had spoken his name that
morning. How should I know whether he were still so ill or no.</p>
<p>The hour for starting had arrived. Richard, who never kept long
out of sight of me, was busy loading the wagon that was to
accompany us, with baskets of things to eat, and with wines and
fruits. Kilian was engrossed in arranging the seats and cushions in
the two carriages which had just driven to the door.</p>
<p>Mary Leighton was fluttering about the flower-bed at the left of
the piazza, making herself lovely with geranium and roses. Sophie,
in a beautiful costume, was pacifying Charley, who had had a
difference with his uncle Kilian. Charlotte and Henrietta were busy
in their small way over a little basket of preserves; and two or
three of the neighboring gentlemen, who were to drive with us, were
approaching the house by a side-entrance.</p>
<p>In a moment or two we should be ready to be off. What should I
do? I was frantic with the thought that he might be worse, he might
go away. I was to be absent such a length of time. I must--I would
see him before we went. What better moment than the present, when
everybody was engaged in this fretting, foolish picnic. I would run
up-stairs--call to him outside his door--make him speak to me.</p>
<p>With a guilty look around, I started up, stole through the group
on the piazza, and ran to the stairs. But alas, Richard had not
failed to mark my movements, and before my foot had touched the
stair his voice recalled me. I started with a guilty look, and
trembled, but dared not meet his eye.</p>
<p>"Pauline, are you going away? We are just ready start."</p>
<p>If I had had any presence of mind I should have made an excuse,
and gone to my own room for a moment, and taken my chance of
getting to the floor above; but I suppose he would have forestalled
me. I could not command a single word, but turned back and followed
him. As we got into the carriage, the voices and the laughing
really seemed to madden me. Driving away from the house, I never
shall forget the sensation of growing heaviness at my heart; it
seemed to be turning into lead. I glanced back at the closed
windows of his room and wondered if he saw us, and if he thought
that I was happy.</p>
<p>The length of that day! The glare of that sun! The chill of that
unnatural wind! Every moment seemed to me an hour. I can remember
with such distinctness the whole day, each thing as it happened;
conversations which seemed so senseless, preparations which seemed
so endless. The taste of the things I tried to eat: the smell of
the grass on which we sat, and the pine-trees above our heads: the
sound of fire blazing under the teakettle, and the pained sensation
of my eyes when the smoke blew across into our faces: the hateful
vibration of Mary Leighton's laugh: all these things are
unnaturally vivid to me at this day.</p>
<p>I don't know what the condition of my brain must have been, to
have received such an exaggerated impression of unimportant
things.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you, Miss Pauline?" said Kilian, throwing
himself down on the grass at my feet. I could not sit down for very
impatience, but was walking restlessly about, and was now standing
for a moment by a great tree under which the table had been spread.
It was four o'clock, and there was only vague talk of going home;
the horses had not yet been brought up, the baskets were not a
quarter packed. Every one was indolent, and a good deal tired; the
gentlemen were smoking, and no one seemed in a hurry.</p>
<p>When Kilian said, "What can I do for you. Miss Pauline?" I could
not help saying, "Take me home."</p>
<p>"Home!" cried Kilian. "Here is somebody talking about going
home. Why, Miss Pauline, I am just beginning to enjoy myself! only
look, it is but four o'clock."</p>
<p>"Oh, let us stay and go home by moonlight," cried Mary Leighton,
in a little rapture.</p>
<p>"Would it not be heavenly!" said Henrietta.</p>
<p>"How about tea?" said Charlotte. "We shall be hungry before
moonlight, and there isn't anything left to eat."</p>
<p>"How material!" cried Kilian, who had eaten an enormous
dinner.</p>
<p>"We shall all get cold," said Sophie, who loved to be
comfortable, "and the children are beginning to be very cross."</p>
<p>"Small blame to them," muttered a dissatisfied man in my ear,
who had singled me out as a companion in discontent, and had
pursued me with his contempt for pastoral entertainments, and for
this entertainment in especial.</p>
<p>"Well, let the people that want to stay, stay; but let us go
home," I said, hastily.</p>
<p>"That is so like you, Pauline," exclaimed Mary Leighton, in a
voice that stung me like nettles.</p>
<p>"It is very like common-sense," I said, "if that's like me."</p>
<p>"Well, it isn't particularly."</p>
<p>"Let dogs delight," said Kilian, "I have a compromise to offer.
If we go home by the bridge we pass the little Brink hotel, where
they give capital teas. We can stop there, rest, get tea, have a
dance in the 'ball-room,' sixteen by twenty, and go home by
moonlight, filling the souls of Miss Leighton and Henrietta with
bliss."</p>
<p>A chorus of ecstasy followed this; Sophie herself was satisfied
with the plan, and exulted in the prospect of washing her face, and
lying down on a bed for half an hour, though only at a little
country inn. Even this low form of civilized life was tempting,
after seven hours spent in communion with nature on hard rocks.</p>
<p>Great alacrity was shown in getting ready and in getting off. I
could not speak to any one, not even the dissatisfied man, but
walked away by myself and tried to let no one see what I was
feeling. After all was ready, I got into the carriage beside one of
the Miss Lowders, and the dissatisfied man sat opposite. He wore
canvas shoes and a corduroy suit, and sleeve-buttons and studs that
were all bugs and bees. I think I could make a drawing of the
sleeve-button on the arm with which he held the umbrella over us;
there were five different forms of insect-life represented on it,
but I remember them all.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you haven't enjoyed yourself very much," said Miss
Lowder, looking at me rather critically.</p>
<p>"I? why--no, perhaps not; I don't generally enjoy myself very
much."</p>
<p>Somebody out on the front seat laughed very shrilly at this: of
course it was Mary Leighton, who was sitting beside Kilian, who
drove. I felt I would have liked to push her over among the horses,
and drive on.</p>
<p>"Isn't her voice like a steel file?" I said with great
simplicity to my companions. The dissatisfied man, writhing
uncomfortably on his seat, four inches too narrow for any one but a
child of six, assented gloomily. Miss Lowder, who was twenty-eight
years old and very well bred, looked disapproving, and changed the
subject. Not much more was said after this. Miss Lowder had a
neuralgic headache, developed by the cold wind and an undigested
dinner eaten irregularly. She was too polite to mention her
sufferings, but leaned back in the carriage and was silent.</p>
<p>My vis-&agrave;-vis was at last relieved by the declining sun
from his task, and so the umbrella-arm and its sleeve-button were
removed from my range of vision.</p>
<p>We counted the mile-posts, and we looked sometimes at our
watches, and so the time wore away.</p>
<p>Kilian and Mary Leighton were chattering incessantly, and did
not pay much attention to us. Kilian drove pretty fast almost all
the way, but sometimes forgot himself when Mary was too seductive,
and let the horses creep along like snails.</p>
<p>"There's our little tavern," cried Kilian at last, starting up
the horses.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry," murmured Mary Leighton, "we have had such a
lovely drive."</p>
<p>My vis-&agrave;-vis groaned and looked at me as this observation
reached us. I laughed a little hysterically: I was so glad to be at
the half-way house--and Mary Leighton's words were so absurd. When
we got out of the carriage, the dissatisfied man stretched his long
English limbs out, and lighting his cigar, began silently to pace
the bricks in front of the house.</p>
<p>Kilian took us into the little parlor (we were the first to
arrive), and committed us to the care of a thin, tired-looking
woman, and then went to see to the comfort of his horses.</p>
<p>The tired woman, who looked as if she never had sat down since
she grew up, took us to some rooms, where we were to rest till tea
was ready. The rooms had been shut up all day, and the sun had been
beating on them: they smelled of paint and dust and ill-brushed
carpets. The water in the pitchers was warm and not very clear: the
towels were very small and thin, the beds were hard, and the
pillows very small, like the towels: they felt soft and warm and
limp, like sick kittens. We threw open the windows and aired the
rooms, and washed our faces and hands: and Miss Lowder lay down on
the bed and put her head on a pile of four of the little pillows
collected from the different rooms. Mary Leighton spent the time in
re-arranging her hair, and I walked up and down the hall, too
impatient to rest myself in any way.</p>
<p>By-and-by the others came, and then there was a hubbub and a
clatter, and poor Miss Lowder's head was overlooked in the
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e; for these were all the rooms the house afforded
for the entertainment of wayfarers, and as there were nine ladies
in our party, it is not difficult to imagine the confusion that
ensued.</p>
<p>Benny and Charley also came to have their hair arranged, and it
devolved on Charlotte and me to do it, as their mamma had thrown
herself exhausted on one of the beds, and with the bolsters doubled
up under her head, was trying to get some rest.</p>
<p>It was fully half-past seven before the tea-bell rang. I seized
Benny's hand, and we were the first on the ground. I don't know how
I thought this would be useful in hurrying matters, for Benny's tea
and mine were very soon taken, and were very insignificant
fractions of the general business.</p>
<p>There were kerosene lamps on the table, and everything was
served in the plainest manner, but the cooking was really good, and
it was evident that the tired woman had been on her feet all her
life to some purpose. Almost every one was hungry, and the contrast
to the cold meats, and the hard rocks, and the disjointed apparatus
of the noonday meal, was very favorable.</p>
<p>Richard had put me between himself and Benny, and he watched my
undiminished supper with disapprobation: but I do not believe he
ate much more himself. He put everything that he thought I might
like, before me, silently: and I think the tired woman (who was
waitress as well as cook), must have groaned over the frequent
changing of my plate.</p>
<p>"Do not take any more of that," he said, as I put out my hand
for another cup of coffee.</p>
<p>"Well, what shall I take?" I exclaimed peevishly. But indeed I
did not mean to be peevish, nor did I know quite what I said, I was
so miserable. Richard sighed as he turned away and answered some
question of Sophie; who was quite revived.</p>
<p>Charlotte and Henrietta each had an admirer, one of the Lowders,
and a young Frenchman who had come with the Lowders.</p>
<p>It had evidently been a very happy day with all the young ladies
from the house. After tea the gentlemen must smoke, and after the
smoking there was to be dancing. The preparations for the dancing
created a good deal of amusement and consumed a great deal of time.
Kilian and young Lowder went a mile and a half to get a man to play
for them. When he came, he had to be instructed as to the style of
music to be furnished, and the rasping and scraping of that
miserable instrument put me beside myself with nervousness. Then
the "ball-room" had to be aired and lighted; then the negro's music
was found to be incompatible with modern movements; even a waltz
was proved impossible, and nobody would consent to remember a
quadrille but Richard. So they had to fall back upon Virginia
reels, and everybody was made to dance.</p>
<p>The dissatisfied man was at my side when the order was given. He
turned to me languidly, and offered me his hand.</p>
<p>"No," I exclaimed, biting my lips with impatience, and added,
"You will excuse me, won't you?"</p>
<p>He said, with grave philosophy, "I really think it will seem
shorter than if we were looking on."</p>
<p>I accepted this wise counsel, and went to dance with him. And
what a dance it was! The blinking kerosene lamps at the sides of
the room, the asparagus boughs overhead, the grinning negro on the
little platform by the door: the amused faces looking in at the
open windows: the romping, well-dressed, pretty women: the handsome
men who were trying to act like clowns: the noise of laughing and
the calling out of the figures: all this, I am sure, I never shall
forget. And, strange to say, I somewhat enjoyed it after all. The
coffee had stimulated me: the music was merry: I was reckless, and
my companions were full of glee. Even the <i>ennuy&eacute;</i>
skipped up and down the room like a school-boy: I never shall
forget Richard's happy and relieved expression, when I laughed
aloud at somebody's amusing blunder.</p>
<p>Then came the reaction, when the dancing was over, and we were
getting ready to go home. It was a good deal after ten o'clock, and
the night was cold. There were not quite shawls enough, no
preparations having been made for staying out after dark. Richard
went up to Sophie (I was standing out by the steps to be ready the
moment the carriages should come), and I heard him negotiating with
her for a shawl for me. She was quite impatient and peremptory,
though <i>sotto voce</i>. The children needed both her extra ones,
and there was an end of it.</p>
<p>I did not care at all, and feeling warm with dancing, did not
dread what I had not yet felt. I pulled my light cloak around me,
and only longed for the carriage to arrive. But after we had
started and were about forty rods from the door, quite out of the
light of the little tavern, just within a grove of locust-trees
(the moon was under clouds), Richard's voice called out to Kilian
to stop, and coming up to the side of the carriage, said, "Put this
around you, Pauline, you haven't got enough." He put something
around my shoulders which felt very warm and comfortable: I believe
I said, Thank you, though I am not at all sure, and Kilian drove on
rapidly.</p>
<p>By-and-by, when I began to feel a little chilly, I drew it
together round my throat: the air was like November, and, August
though it was, there was a white frost that night. I was frightened
when I found what I had about my shoulders. It was Richard's coat.
I called to Kilian to stop a moment, I wanted to speak to Richard.
But when we stopped, the carriage in which he was to drive was just
behind us--and some one in it said, Richard had walked. He had not
come back after he ran out to speak to us--must have struck across
the fields and gone ahead. And Richard walked home, five miles,
that night! the only way to save himself from the deadly chill of
the keen air, without his coat.</p>
<p>When we drove into the gate, at home, I stooped eagerly forward
to get a sight of the house through the trees. There was a light
burning in the room over mine: that was all I wanted to know, and
with a sigh of relief I sank back.</p>
<p>When we went into the hall, I remembered to hang Richard's coat
upon a rack there, and then ran to my room. I could not get any
news of Mr. Langenau, and could not hear how the day had gone with
him: could only take the hope that the sight of the little lamp
conveyed.</p>

<br>
<p>Of course, the night was entirely sleepless after such, a day. I
was over-tired, and the coffee would have been fatal to rest in any
case. I tossed about restlessly till three o'clock, and then fell
into a heavy sleep.</p>
<p>The sun was shining into the room, and I heard the voices of
people on the lawn when I awoke. When I went down, after a hurried
and nervous half-hour of dressing, I found the morning, apparently,
half gone, and the breakfast-table cleared.</p>
<p>Mary Leighton, with a croquet mallet in her hand, was following
Kilian through the hall to get a drink of water. She made a great
outcry at me and my appearance.</p>
<p>"What a headache you must have," she cried. "But ah! think what
you've missed, dear! The tutor has been down at breakfast, or
rather at the breakfast-table, for he didn't eat a thing. He is a,
little paler than he was at dinner day before yesterday--and he's
gone up-stairs; and we've voted that we hope he'll stay there, for
he depresses us just to look at him."</p>
<p>And then, with an unmeaning laugh, she tripped on after Kilian
to get that drink of water, which was nothing but a ticket for a
moment's <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> away from the
croquet party. Richard had seen me by this time, and came in and
asked how I felt, and rang the bell in the dining-room, and ordered
my breakfast brought. He did not exactly stay and watch it, but he
came in and out of the dining-room enough times to see that I had
everything that was dainty and nice (and to see, alas! that I could
not eat it); for that piece of news from Mary Leighton had levelled
me with the ground again.</p>
<p>That I had missed seeing him was too cruel, and that he looked
so ill; how could I bear it?</p>
<p>After my breakfast was taken away, I went into the hall, and sat
down on the sofa between the parlor doors. Pretty soon the people
came in from the croquet ground, talking fiercely about a game in
which Kilian and Mary had been cheating. Charlotte Benson was quite
angry, and Charley, who had played with her, was enraged. I thought
they were such, fools to care, and Richard looked as if he thought
they were all silly children. The day was warm and close, such a
contrast to the day before. The sudden cold had broken down into a
sultry August atmosphere. The sun, which had been bright an hour
ago, was becoming obscured, and the sky was grayish. Every one felt
languid. We were all sitting about the hall, idly, when a servant
brought a note. It was an invitation; that roused them all--and for
to-day. There was no time to lose.</p>
<p>The Lowders had sent to ask us all to a croquet party there at
four o'clock.</p>
<p>"What an hour!" cried Sophie, who was tired; "I should think
they might have let us get rested from the picnic."</p>
<p>But Charlotte and Henrietta were so much charmed at the prospect
of seeing so soon the Frenchman and the young devoted Lowder, that
they listened to no criticism on the hour or day.</p>
<p>"How nice!" they said, "we shall get there a little before
five--play for a couple of hours--then have tea on the lawn,
perhaps--a little dance, and home by moonlight." It was a ravishing
prospect for their unemployed imaginations, and they left no time
in rendering their answer.</p>
<p>For myself, I had taken a firm resolve. I would never repeat the
misery of yesterday; nothing should persuade me to go with them,
but I would manage it so that I should be free from every one, even
Richard.</p>
<p>Croquet parties are great occasions for pretty costumes; all
this was talked over. What should I wear? Oh, my gray grenadine,
with the violet trimmings, and a gray hat with violet velvet and
feather.</p>
<p>"You have everything so perfect for that suit," said Mary
Leighton, in a tone of envy. "Cravat and parasol and gloves of just
the shade of violet."</p>
<p>"And gray boots," I said. "It <i>is</i> a pretty suit." No one
but Sophie had such expensive clothes as I, but I cannot say at
that moment they made me very happy. I was only thinking how
improbable that the gray suit would come out of the box that day,
unless I should be obliged to dress to mislead the others till the
last.</p>
<p>The carriages (for we filled two), were to be at the door at
four o'clock punctually. The Lowders were five miles away: the
whole thing was so talked about and planned about, that when dinner
was over, I felt we had had a croquet party, and quite a long one
at that.</p>
<p>Mr. Langenau did not come to dinner; Sophie sent a servant to
his room after we were at table, to ask him if he would come down,
or have his dinner sent to him; but the servant came back, saying
he did not want any dinner, with his compliments to Mrs.
Hollenbeck.</p>
<p>"<i>&Agrave; la bonne heure</i>" cried Kilian. "A skeleton
always interferes with my appetite at a feast."</p>
<p>"It is the only thing, then, that does, isn't it?" asked
Charlotte, who seemed to have a pick at him always.</p>
<p>"No, not the only thing. There is one other--just one
other."</p>
<p>"And, for the sake of science, what is that?"</p>
<p>"A woman with a sharp tongue, Miss Charlotte.--Sophie, I don't
think much of these last soups. Your famous cook's degenerating,
take my word."</p>
<p>And so on, while Charlotte colored, and was silent through the
meal. She knew her tongue was sharp; she knew that she was
self-willed and was not humble. But she had not taken herself in
hand, religiously; to take one's self in hand morally, or on
grounds of expediency, never amounts to much; and such taking in
hand was all that Charlotte had as yet attempted. In a little
passion of self-reproach and mortification, she occasionally lopped
off ugly shoots; but the root was still vigorous and lusty, and
only grew the better for its petty pruning. Richard looked very
much displeased at his brother's rudeness, and tried to make up for
it by great kindness and attention.</p>
<p>About this time I had become aware of what were Sophie's plans
for Richard. In case he must marry (to be cured of me), he was to
marry Charlotte, who was so capable, so sensible, of so good
family, so much indebted to Sophie, and so decidedly averse to
living in the country. Sophie saw herself still mistress here,
with, to be sure, a shortened income, and Richard and his wife
spending a few weeks with her in the summer. I do not know how far
Charlotte entered into these plans. Probably not at all,
consciously; but I became aware that, as a little girl, Richard had
been her hero; and he did not seem to have been displaced by any
one entirely yet. But I took a very faint interest in all this. I
should have cared, probably, if I had seen Richard devoted to her.
He seemed to belong to me, and I should have resented any
interference with my rights. But I did not dread any. I knew,
though I took little pleasure in the knowledge, that he loved me
with all his good and manly heart; and it never seemed a
possibility that he could change.</p>
<p>The simple selfishness of young women in these matters is
appalling. Richard was mine by right of conquest, and I owed him no
gratitude for the service of his life. That other was the lord who
had the right inalienable over me. I bent myself in the dust before
him. I would have taken shame itself as an honor from his hands. I
thought of him day and night. I filled my soul with passionate
admiration for his good deeds, his ill deeds, his all. And the
other was as the ground beneath my feet, of which I seldom
thought.</p>
<p>Richard met me at the foot of the stairs, after dinner, as I was
going up.</p>
<p>"Pauline, will you go in the carriage with Charlotte and Sophie?
I am going to drive."</p>
<p>"Oh, it doesn't make any difference," I answered, with
confusion. "Anywhere you choose."</p>
<p>I think he had misgivings about my going from that moment; to
allay which, I called out something about my costume to Sophie as I
went up to my room. The day was growing duller, and stiller, and
grayer. I sat by the window and watched the leaden river. It was
like an afternoon in September, before the chill of the autumn has
come. Not a leaf moved upon the trees, not a cloud crept over the
sky. It was all one dim, gray, gloomy stillness overhead. I
wondered if they would have rain. <i>They</i>, not I, for I was
going to stay at home, and before they came back I should have seen
him. I said that over and over to myself with bated breath, and
cheeks that burned like flame. Every step that passed my door made
me start guiltily. Once, when some one knocked, I pulled out my
gray dress, and flung it on the bed, before I answered.</p>
<p>It was approaching four o'clock. I undressed myself rapidly, put
on a dressing-sack, and threw myself upon the bed. What should I
say when they came for me? They could not <i>make</i> me go. I felt
very brave. At last the carriages drove up to the door. I crept to
the window to see if any one was ready. While I was watching
through the half-closed blinds, some one crossed the piazza. My
heart gave a great leap, and then every pulse stood still. It was
Mr. Langenau. His step was slower than it used to be, and, I
thought, a little faltering. He crossed the road, and took the path
that led through the grove and garden to the river. He had a book
under his arm; he must be going to the boat-house to sit there and
read. My heart gave such an ecstasy of life to my veins at the
thought, that for a moment I felt sick and faint, as I drew back
from the window.</p>
<p>I threw myself on the bed as some one knocked. It was a servant
to tell me they were ready. I sent word to Mrs. Hollenbeck that I
was not well, and should not be able to go with them. Then I lay
still and waited in much trepidation for the second knock. I heard
in a few moments the rustle of Sophie's dress outside. She was not
pleased at all. She could scarcely be polite. But then everything
looked very plausible. There lay my dress upon the bed, as if I had
begun to dress, and I was pale and trembling, and I am sure must
have looked ill enough to have convinced her that I spoke the
truth.</p>
<p>She made some feeble offer to stay and take care of me. "Oh,
pray don't," I cried, too eagerly, I am afraid. And then she said
her maid should come and stay with me, for the children were going
with them, and there would be nothing for her to do. I stammered
thanks, and then she went away. I did not dare to move till after I
had heard both carriages drive off, and all voices die away in the
distance.</p>
<p>Bettina came to the door, and was sent away with thanks. Then I
began to dress myself with very trembling hands. This was new work
to me, this horrible deception. But all remorse for that, was
swallowed up in the one engrossing thought and desire which had
usurped my soul for the days just passed.</p>
<p>It was a full half-hour before I was ready, my hands shook so
unaccountably, and I could scarcely find the things I wanted to put
on. When I went to the door I could hardly turn the key, I felt so
weak, and I stood in the passage many minutes before I dared go on.
If any one had appeared or spoken to me, I am quite sure I should
have fainted, my nerves were in such a shaken state.</p>

Or poison doubtless; but from water--feel!<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>I met no one in the hall or on the piazza. The house was silent
and deserted: one of the maids was closing the parlor windows. She
did not look at me with any surprise, for she had not probably
heard that I was ill.</p>
<p>Once in the open air I felt stronger. I took the river-path, and
walked quickly, feeling freed from a nightmare: and my mind was
filled with one thought. "In a few moments I shall be beside him, I
shall make him look at me, he cannot help but touch my hand." I did
not think of past or future, only of the greedy, passionate
present. My infatuation was at its height. I cannot imagine a
passion more absorbing, more unresisted, and more dangerous. I
passed quickly through the garden without even noticing the flowers
that brushed against my dress.</p>
<p>As I reached the grove I thought for one instant of the morning
that he had met me here, just where the paths intersected. At that
moment I heard a step; and full of that hope, with a quick thrill,
I glanced in the direction of the sound. There, not ten yards from
me, coming from the opposite direction, was Richard. I felt a shock
of disappointment, then fear, then anger. What right had he to dog
me so? He looked at me without surprise, but as if his heart was
full of bitterness and sorrow. He approached, and turned as if to
walk with me.</p>
<p>"I want to be alone," I said angrily, moving away from him.</p>
<p>"No, Pauline," he answered with a sigh, as he turned from me,
"you do not want to be alone."</p>
<p>Full of shame and anger, and jarred with the shock and fear, I
went on more slowly. The wood was so silent--the river through the
trees lay so still and leaden. If it had not been for the fire
burning in my heart, I could have thought the world was dead.</p>
<p>There was not a sound but my own steps; should I soon meet him,
would he be sitting in his old seat by the boat-house door, or
would he be wandering along the dead, still river-bank? What should
I say to him? O! he would speak. If he saw me he would have to
speak.</p>
<p>I soon forgot that I had met Richard, that I had been angry; and
again I had but this one thought.</p>
<p>The pine cones were slippery under my feet. I held by the old
trees as I went down the bank, step by step. I had to turn and pass
a clump of trees before I reached the boat-house door.</p>
<p>I was there! With a beating heart I stepped up on the threshold.
There were two doors, one that opened on the path, one that opened
on the river. The house was empty. I had a little sinking pang of
disappointment, but I passed on to the door looking out on the
river. By this door was a seat, empty, but on this lay a book and a
straw hat. I could feel the hot blushes cover my face, my neck, as
I caught sight of these. I stooped down, feeling guilty, and took
up the book. It was a book which he had read daily to me in our
lesson-hours. It had his name on the blank page, and was full of
his pencil-marks. I meant to ask him to give me this book; I would
rather have it than anything the world held, when I should be
parted from him. <i>When!</i> I sat down on the seat beside the
door, with the book lying in my lap, the straw hat on the bench. I
longed to take it in my hands--to wreathe it with the clematis that
grew about the door, as I had done one foolish, happy afternoon,
not three weeks ago. But with a strange inconsistency, I dared not
touch it; my face grew hot with blushes as I thought of it.</p>
<p>How should I meet him? Now that the moment I had longed for had
arrived, I wondered that I had dared to long for it. I felt that if
I heard his step, I should fly and hide myself from him. The
recollection of that last interview in the library--which I had
lived over and over, nights and days, incessantly, since then, came
back with fresh force, fresh vehemence. But no step approached me,
all was silent; it began to impress me strangely, and I looked
about me. I don't know at what moment it was, my eye fell upon the
trace of footsteps on the bank, and then on the mark of the boat
dragged along the sand; a little below the boat-house it had been
pushed off into the water.</p>
<p>I started to my feet, and ran down to the water's edge (at the
boat-house the trees had been in the way of my seeing the river any
distance).</p>
<p>I stood still, the water lapping faintly on the sand at my feet;
it was hardly a sound. I looked out on the unruffled lead-colored
river: there, about quarter of a mile from the bank, the boat was
lying: empty --motionless. The oars were floating a few rods from
her, drifting slowly, slowly, down the stream.</p>
<p>The sight seemed to turn my warm blood and blushes into ice:
even before I had a distinct impression of what I feared, I was
benumbed. But it did not take many moments for the truth, or a
dread of it, to reach my brain.</p>
<p>I covered my eyes with my hands, then sprang up the bank and
called wildly.</p>
<p>My voice was like a madwoman's, and it must have sounded far on
that still air. In less than a moment Richard came hurrying with
great strides down the path. I sprang to him, and caught his arm
and dragged him to the water's edge.</p>
<p>"Look," I whispered--pointing to the hat and book--and then out
to the boat. I read his face in terror. It grew slowly, deadly
white.</p>
<p>"My God!" he said in a tone of awe. Then shaking me from him,
sprang up the bank, and his voice was something fearful as he
shouted, as he ran, for help.</p>
<p>There were men laboring, two or three fields off. I don't know
how long it took them to get to him, nor how long to get a boat out
on the water, nor what boat it was. I know they had ropes and
poles, and that they were talking in eager, hurried voices, as they
passed me.</p>
<p>I sat on the steps that led down the bank, clinging to the low
railing with my hands: I had sunk down because my strength had
given way all at once, and I felt as if everything were rocking and
surging under me. Sometimes everything was black before me, and
then again I could see plainly the wide expanse of the river, the
wide expanse of the gray sky, and between them--the empty,
motionless boat, and the floating oars beyond upon the tide.</p>
<p>The voices of the men, and the splashing of the water, when at
last they were launched and pulling away from shore, made a
ringing, frightful noise in my head. I watched till I saw them
reach the boat--till I saw one of them get over in it. Then while
they groped about with ropes and poles, and lashed their boats
together, and leaned over and gazed down into the water, I watched
in a strange, benumbed state.</p>
<p>But, by-and-by, there were some exclamations--a stir, and effort
of strength. I saw them pulling in the ropes with combined
movement. I saw them leaning over the side of the boat, nearest the
shore, and together trying to lift something heavy over into it. I
saw the water dripping as they raised it--and then I think I must
have swooned. For I knew nothing further till I heard Richard's
voice, and, raising my head, saw him leaping from the boat upon the
bank. The other boat was further out, and was approaching slowly. I
stood up as he came to me, and held by the railing.</p>
<p>"I want you to go up to the house," he said, gently, "there can
be no good in your staying here."</p>
<p>"I will stay," I cried, everything coming back to me. "I
will--will see him."</p>
<p>"There is no hope, Pauline," he said, in a quick voice, for the
boat was very near the bank, "or very little--and you must not
stay. Everything shall be done that can be done. I will do all. But
you must not stay."</p>
<p>"I will," I said, frantically, trying to burst past him. He
caught my arms and turned me toward the boat-house, and led me
through it, out into the path that went up to the grove.</p>
<p>"Go home," he said, in a voice I never shall forget. "You shall
not make a spectacle for these men. I have promised you I will do
all. Mind you obey me strictly, and go up to your room and wait
there till I come."</p>
<p>I don't know how I got there. I believe Bettina found me at the
entrance to the garden, and helped me to the house, and put me on
my bed.</p>
<p>An hour passed--perhaps more--and such an hour! (for I was not
for a moment unconscious, after this, only deadly faint and weak),
and then Richard came. The door was a little open, and he pushed it
back and came in, and stood beside the bed.</p>
<p>I suppose the sight of me, so broken and spoiled by suffering,
overcame him, for he stooped down suddenly, and kissed me, and then
did not speak for a moment.</p>
<p>At last he said, in a voice not quite steady, "I didn't mean to
be hard on you, Pauline. But you know I had to do it."</p>
<p>"And there isn't any--any--" I gasped for the words, and could
hardly speak.</p>
<p>"No, none, Pauline," he said, keeping my hand in his. "The
doctors have just gone away. It was all no use."</p>
<p>"Tell me about it," I whispered.</p>
<p>"About what?" he said, looking troubled.</p>
<p>"About how it happened."</p>
<p>"Nobody can tell," he answered, averting his face. "We can only
conjecture about some things. Don't try to think about it. Try to
rest."</p>
<p>"How does he look?" I whispered, clinging to his hand.</p>
<p>"Just the same as ever; more quiet, perhaps," he answered,
looking troubled.</p>
<p>I gave a sort of gasp, but did not cry. I think he was
frightened, for he said, uneasily, "Let me call Bettina; she can
give you something--she can sit beside you."</p>
<p>I shook my head, and said, faintly, "Don't let her come."</p>
<p>"I have sent for Sophie," he said, soothingly. "She will soon be
here, and will know what to do for you."</p>
<p>"Keep her out of this room," I cried, half raising myself, and
then falling back from sudden faintness. "Don't let her come
<i>near</i> me," I panted, after a moment, "nor any of them, but,
most of all, Sophie; remember--don't let her even look at me;" and
with moaning, I turned my face down on the pillow. I had taken in
about a thousandth fraction of my great calamity by that time.
Every moment was giving to me some additional possession of it.</p>
<p>Some one at that instant called Richard, in that subdued tone
that people use about a house in which there is one dead.</p>
<p>"I have got to go," he said, uneasily. I still kept hold of his
hand. "But I will come back before very long; and I will tell
Bettina to bring a chair and sit outside your door, and not let any
one come in."</p>
<p>"That will do," I said, letting go his hand, "only I don't want
my door shut tight."</p>
<p>I felt as if the separation were not so entire, so tremendous,
while I could hear what was going on below, and know that no door
was shut between us--no door! Bettina, in a moment more, had taken
up her station in the passage-way outside.</p>
<p>I heard people coming and going quietly through the hall below.
I heard doors softly shut and opened.</p>
<p>I knew, by some intuition, that <i>he</i> was lying in the
library. They moved furniture with a smothered sound; and when I
heard two or three men sent off on messages by Richard, even the
horses' hoofs seemed to be muffled as they struck the ground. This
was the effect of the coming in of death into busy, household life.
I had never been under the roof with it before.</p>
<p>About dusk a servant came to the door, with a tray of tea and
something to eat, that Mr. Richard had sent her with.</p>
<p>"No," I said, "don't leave it here."</p>
<p>But, in a few moments, Richard himself brought it back. I can
well imagine how anxious and unhappy he felt. He had, perhaps,
never before had charge of any one ill or in trouble, and this was
a strange experience.</p>
<p>"You must eat something, Pauline," he said. "I want you to. Sit
up, and take this tea."</p>
<p>I was not inclined to dispute his will, but raised my head, and
drank the tea, and ate a few mouthfuls of the biscuit. But that
made me too ill, and I put the plate away from me.</p>
<p>"I am very sorry," I said, meekly, "but I can't eat it. I feel
as if it choked me."</p>
<p>He seemed touched with my submissiveness, and, giving Bettina
the tray, stood looking down at me as if he did not know how to say
something that was in his mind. Suddenly my ear, always quick, now
exaggeratedly so, caught sound of carriage-wheels. I started up and
cried, "They are coming," and hid my face in my hands.</p>
<p>"Don't be troubled," he said, "you shall not be disturbed."</p>
<p>"Oh, Richard," I exclaimed, as he was going away, after another
undecided movement as if to speak, "you know what I want."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know," he said, in a low voice.</p>
<p>"And now they're come, I cannot. They will see him, and I
cannot."</p>
<p>"Be patient. I will arrange for you to go. Don't, don't,
Pauline."</p>
<p>For I was in a sort of spasm, though no tears came, and my sobs
were more like the gasps of a person being suffocated, than like
one in grief.</p>
<p>"If you will only be quiet, I will take you down, after a few
hours, when they are all gone to their rooms. Pauline, you'll kill
me; don't do so--Pauline, they'll hear you. Try not to do so;
that's right--lie down and try to quiet yourself, poor child. I
can't bear to go away; but there is Sophie on the stairs."</p>
<p>He had scarcely time to reach the hall before Sophie burst upon
him with almost a shriek.</p>
<p>"What is this horrible affair, Richard? What a terrible disgrace
and scandal! we never shall get over it. Will it get in the papers,
do you think? I am so ill--I have been in such a state since the
news came. Such a drive home as this has been! Oh, Richard, tell me
all about it quickly. Where is Pauline? how does she bear it?"
making for my door.</p>
<p>Richard put out his hand and stopped her. I had sprung up from
the bed, and stood, trembling violently, at the further extremity
of the room. I do not know what I meant to do if she came in, for I
was almost beside myself at that moment.</p>
<p>She was persistent, angry, agitated. How well I knew the
curiosity that made her so intent to gain admission to me. It was
not so much that I dreaded being a spectacle, as the horror and
hatred I felt at being approached by her coldness and hypocrisy,
while I was so sore and wounded. I was hardly responsible; I don't
think I could have borne the touch of her hand.</p>
<p>But Richard saved me, and sent her away angry. I crept back to
the bed, and lay down on it again. I heard the others whispering as
they passed through the hall. Mary Leighton was crying; Charlotte
was silent. I don't think I heard her voice at all.</p>
<p>After a long while I heard them go down, and go into the
dining-room. They spoke in very subdued tones, and there was only
the slightest movement of china and silver, to indicate that a meal
was going on. But this seemed to give me a more frantic sense of
change than anything else. I flung myself across the bed, and
another of those dreadful, tearless spasms seized me.
Everything--all life--was going on just the same; even in this very
house they were eating and drinking as they ate and drank
before--the very people who had talked with him this day; the very
table at which he had sat this morning. Oh! they were so heartless
and selfish: every one was; life itself was. I did not know where
to turn for comfort. I had a feeling of dreading every one, of
shrinking away from every one.</p>
<p>"Oh!" I said to myself, "if Richard is with them at the table, I
never want to see him again."</p>
<p>But Richard was not with them. In a moment or two he came to the
door, only to ask me if I wanted anything, and to say he would come
back by-and-by.</p>
<p>There was a question which I longed so frantically to ask him,
but which I dared not; my life seemed to hang on the answer.
<i>When were they going to take him away?</i> I had heard something
about trains and carriages, and I had a wild dread that it was soon
to be.</p>
<p>I went to the door and called Richard back, and made him
understand what I wanted to know. He looked troubled, and said in a
low tone,</p>
<p>"At four o'clock we go from here to meet the earliest train. I
have telegraphed his friends, and have had an answer. I am going
down myself, and it is all arranged in the best way, I think. Go
and lie down now, Pauline; I will come and take you down soon as
the house is quiet."</p>
<p>Richard went away unconscious of the stab his news had given me.
I had not counted on anything so sudden as this parting. While he
was in the house, while I was again to look upon his face, the end
had not come; there was a sort of hope, though only a hope of
suffering, something to look forward to, before black monotony
began its endless day.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>The tall old clock, which stood by the dining-room door, had
struck two, and been silent many minutes, before Richard came to
me. I had spent those dreadful hours in feverish restlessness: my
room seemed suffocating to me. I had walked about, had put away my
trinkets, I had changed my dress, and put on a white one which I
had worn in the morning, and had tried to braid my hair.</p>
<p>The quieting of the house, it seemed, would never come. It was
twelve o'clock before any one came up-stairs. I heard one door
after another shut, and then sat waiting and wondering why Richard
did not come, till the moments seemed to grow to centuries. At last
I heard him at the door, and I went toward it trembling, and
followed him into the hall. He carried a light, for up-stairs it
was all dark, and when we reached the stairway, he took my hand to
lead me. I was trembling very much; the hall below was dimly lit by
a large lamp which had been turned low. Our steps on the bare
staircase made so much noise, though we tried to move so silently.
It was weird and awful. I clung to Richard's hand in silence. He
led me across the hall, and stopped before the library-door. He let
go my hand, and taking a key from his pocket, put it in the lock,
turned it slowly, then opened the door a little way, and motioned
me to enter.</p>
<p>Like one in a trance, I obeyed him, and went in alone. He shut
the door noiselessly, and left me with the dead.</p>
<p>That was the great, the immense hour of my life. No vicissitude,
no calamity of this mortal state, no experience that may be to
come, can ever have the force, the magnitude of this. All feelings,
but a child's feelings, were comparatively new to me, and here, at
one moment, I had put into my hand the plummet that sounded hell;
anguish, remorse, fear--a woman's heart in hopeless pain. For I
will not believe that any child, that any woman, had ever loved
more absolutely, more passionately, than I had loved the man who
lay there dead before me. But I cannot talk about what I felt in
those moments; all that concerns what I write is the external.</p>
<p>The--coffin was in the middle of the room, where the table
ordinarily stood--where my chair had been that night, when he told
me his story. Surely if I sinned, in thought, in word, <i>that</i>
night, I paid its full atonement, <i>this</i>. Candles stood on a
small table at the head of where he lay, and many flowers were
about the room. The smell of verbena-leaves filled the air: a
branch of them was in a vase that some one had put beside his
coffin. The fresh, cool night-air came in from the large window,
open at the top.</p>
<p>His face was, as Richard said, much as in life, only quieter. I
do not know what length of time Richard left me there, but at last,
I was recalled to the present, by his hand upon my shoulder, and
his voice in a whisper, "Come with me now, Pauline."</p>
<p>I rose to my feet, hardly understanding what he said, but
resisted when I did understand him.</p>
<p>"Come with me," he said, gently, "You shall come back again and
say good-bye. Only come out into the hall and stay awhile with me;
it is not good for you to be here so long."</p>
<p>He took my hand and led me out, shutting the door noiselessly.
He took me across the hall, and into the parlor, where there was no
light, except what came in from the hall. There was a sofa opposite
the door, and to that he led me, standing himself before me, with
his perplexed and careworn face. I was very silent for some time:
all that awful time in the library, I had never made a sound: but
suddenly, some thought came that reached the source of my tears,
and I burst into a passion of weeping. I am not sure what it was: I
think, perhaps, the sight of the piano, and the recollection of
that magnificent voice that would never be heard again, Whatever it
was, I bless it, for I think it saved my brain. I threw myself down
upon the sofa, and clung to Richard's hand, and sobbed, and sobbed,
and sobbed.</p>
<p>Poor fellow! my tears seemed to shake him terribly. Once he
turned away, and drew his hand across his brow, as if it were a
little more than he could bear. But some men, like many women, are
born to sacrifice.</p>
<p>He tried to comfort and soothe me with broken words. But what
was there to say?</p>
<p>"Oh, Richard," I cried, "What does it all mean? why am I so
punished? was it so very wicked to have loved him after I knew all?
Was all this allowed to come because I did that? Answer me, tell
me; tell me what you think."</p>
<p>"No, Pauline, I don't think that was it. Don't talk about it
now. Try to be quiet. You are not fit to think about it now."</p>
<p>"But, Richard, what else can it mean? I know, I know that it is
the truth. God wouldn't have sent such a punishment upon me if he
hadn't seen my sin."</p>
<p>"It's more likely He sent it to--" and then he paused.</p>
<p>I know now he meant, it was more likely He had sent it to save
me from the sins of others; but he had the holy charity not to say
it.</p>
<p>"Oh," I cried, passionately, "When all the sin was mine, that he
should have had to die: when he never came near me, never looked at
me: when he would rather die than break his word to me. That night
in the library, after he had told me all, he said, 'I will never
look into your eyes again, I will never touch your hand;' and
though we were in the same room together after that, and in the
same house all this time, and though he knew I loved him so--he
never looked at me, he never turned his eyes upon me; and I--I was
willing to sin for him--to die for him. I would have followed him
to the ends of the earth, not twelve hours ago."</p>
<p>"Hush, Pauline," said Richard huskily, "you don't know what
you're saying--you are a child."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not a child--after to-day, after to-night--I am not a
child--and I know too well what I say--too well--too well. Richard,
you don't know what has been in my heart. That night, he held me in
his arms and kissed me--when he said good-bye. Then I was innocent,
for I was dazed by grief and had not come to my senses, after what
he told me. But to-day I said--<i>to-day</i>--to have his arms
around me once again--to have him kiss me once again as he kissed
me then--I would go away from all I ever had been taught of right
and duty, and would be satisfied."</p>
<p>"Then, thank God for what has come," said Richard, hoarsely,
wiping from his forehead the great drops that had broken out upon
it.</p>
<p>"No!" I cried with a fresh burst of weeping. "No, I cannot thank
God, for I want him back again. <i>I want him</i>. I had rather die
than be separated from him. I cannot thank God for taking him away
from me. Oh, Richard, what shall I do? I loved him, loved him so.
Don't look so stern; don't turn away from me. You used to love me.
Could you thank God for taking me away from you, out of your arms,
warm, and strong, and living, and making me cold, and dumb, and
stiff, like <i>that</i>?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Pauline, if it had been to save us both from sin."</p>
<p>"You don't know what love is, if you say that."</p>
<p>"I know what sin is, better than you do, maybe. Listen, Pauline.
I've loved you ever since I saw you; men don't often love better
than I have loved you; but I'd rather drag you, to-night, to that
black river there, and hold you down with my own hands till the
breath left your body, than see you turn into a sinful woman, and
lead the life of shame you tell me you had it in your heart to
lead, to-day."</p>
<p>"Is it so very awful?" I whispered with a shiver, my own emotion
stilled before his. "I only loved him!"</p>
<p>"Forget you ever did," he said, rising, and pacing up and down
the room.</p>
<p>I put my hands before my face, and felt as if I were alone in
the world with sin. If this unspoken, passionate, sweet thought,
that I had harbored, were so full of danger as to force God to
blast me with such punishment, as to drive this tender, generous,
loving man to wish me dead, what must be the blackness of the sin
from which I had been saved, if I were saved? If there were,
indeed, anything but shocks of woe and punishment, and deadly
despair and darkness, in this strange world in which I found
myself. There was a silence. I rose to my feet. I don't know what I
meant to do or where to go; my only impulse was to hide myself from
the eyes of my companion, and to go away from him, as I had hidden
myself from all others, since I was smitten with this
chastisement.</p>
<p>"Forgive me, Pauline," he said, coming to my side. "It is the
second time I have been harsh with you this dreadful day. This is
what comes of selfishness. I hope you will forget what I have
said."</p>
<p>I still turned to go away, feeling afraid of him and ashamed
before him. He put out his hand to stop me.</p>
<p>"Pauline, remember, I have been sorely tried. I would do
anything to comfort you. I haven't another wish in my heart but to
be of use to you."</p>
<p>"Oh, Richard," I cried, bursting into tears afresh, and hiding
my eyes, "if you give me up and drive me away from you, I am all
alone. There isn't another human being that I love or that cares
for me. Dear Richard, do be good to me; do be sorry for me."</p>
<p>"I am sorry for you, Pauline; you know that."</p>
<p>"And you will take care of me?" I cried, stretching out my arms
toward him, with a sudden overwhelming sense of my loneliness and
destitution.</p>
<p>"Yes, Pauline, to the end of my life or of yours; as if you were
my sister or almost my child."</p>
<p>"Dear Richard," I whispered, as I buried my face on his arm, "if
it were not for you I should not live through this dreadful time. I
hope I shall die soon; as soon as I am better. But till I do die, I
hope you will be good to me, and love me." And I pressed his hand
against my cheek and lips, like the poor, frantic, grief-bewildered
child that I was.</p>
<p>At this moment there came a sound of movement in the stables: I
heard one of the heavy doors thrown open, and a man leading a horse
across the stable-floor. (The windows were open and the night was
very still.) Richard started, and looked uneasily at his watch,
stepping to the door to get the light.</p>
<p>"How late is it?" I faltered.</p>
<p>"Half-past three," he said, turning his eyes away, as if he
could not bear the sight of my face. I do not like to remember the
dreadful moments that followed this: the misery that I put upon
Richard by my passionate, ungoverned grief. I threw myself upon the
floor, I clung to his knees, I prayed him to delay the hour of
going--another hour, another day. I said all the wild and frantic
things that were in my heart, as he closed the library-door and led
me to my room.</p>
<p>"Try to say your prayers, Pauline," was all he could answer
me.</p>
<p>I did try to say them, as I knelt by the window, and saw in the
dull, gray dawn, those two carriages drive slowly from the
door.</p>
<p>Richard went away alone. Kilian indeed came down-stairs just as
he was starting.</p>
<p>Sophie had awakened, and called him into her room for a few
moments.</p>
<p>Then he came down, and I saw him get into the carriage alone,
and motion the man to drive on, after that other--which stood
waiting a few rods farther on.</p>

<br>
<p>A thing which surprises me very much in looking over those days
of suffering, is, that during that day a frightful irritability is
the emotion that I most remember--an irritability of feeling, not
of expression: for I lay quite still upon the bed all day, and only
answered, briefly and simply, the questions of Sophie and the
maid.</p>
<p>I could not sleep: it was many hours since I had slept: but
nothing seemed further from possibility than sleeping. The lightest
sound enraged my nerves: the approach of any one made me frantic. I
lay with my hands crushed together, and my teeth against each
other, whenever Sophie entered the room.</p>
<p>She tried to be sympathetic and kind: but she was not much
encouraged. Toward afternoon, she left me a good deal alone. "I
wonder how people feel when they are going mad," I said, getting up
and putting cold water on my head. I was so engaged with the
strange sensations that pursued me, that I did not dwell upon my
trouble.</p>
<p>"Is this the way you feel when you are going to die? or what
happens if you never go to sleep?" My body was so young and
healthy, that it was making a good fight.</p>
<p>Just at dusk, Richard returned. In a little while, about half an
hour, Sophie came and told me Richard would like to see me in her
little dressing-room.</p>
<p>The day of panic and horror was over, and proprieties must begin
their sway. I felt I hated Sophie for making me go out of my own
room, but I pulled a shawl over my shoulders and followed her
across the hall into her little room. There Richard was waiting for
me. He gave me a chair, and then said, "You needn't wait, Sophie,"
and sat down beside me.</p>
<p>Sophie went away half angry, and Richard looked at me
uneasily.</p>
<p>"I thought you'd want to see me," he said.</p>
<p>"Yes," I answered; "I wish you'd tell me everything," but in so
commonplace a voice, I know that he was startled.</p>
<p>"You do not feel well, do you? Maybe we'd better not talk about
it now."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. You might as well tell me all to-night."</p>
<p>"Well, everything is done. The two persons to whom I telegraphed
met me at the station. There was very little delay. I went with
them to the cemetery."</p>
<p>"I am very glad of that. I thought perhaps you wouldn't go. Was
there a clergyman, or don't they have a clergyman when--when--"</p>
<p>"There was a clergyman," said Richard, briefly.</p>
<p>"I hope you'll take me there some time," I said dreamily.
"Should you know where to go--exactly?"</p>
<p>"Exactly," he answered. "But, Pauline, I am afraid you havn't
rested at all to-day. Have you slept?"</p>
<p>"No; and I wish I could; my head feels so strangely--light, you
know--and as if I couldn't think."</p>
<p>"Haven't you seen the Doctor?"</p>
<p>"No--and that's what I want to say. I <i>won't</i> have the
Doctor here; and I want you to take me home to-morrow morning,
early, I have put a good many of my clothes into my trunk, and
Bettina will help me with the rest to-night. Isn't there any train
before the five o'clock?"</p>
<p>"No," said Richard, uneasily. "Pauline, I think you'd better not
arrange to go away to-morrow."</p>
<p>"If you don't take me out of this house I shall go mad. I have
been thinking about it all day, and I know I shall."</p>
<p>Richard was silent for a moment, then, with the wise instinct of
affection, wonderful in man, and in a man who had had no experience
in dealing with diseased or suffering minds, he acquiesced in my
plan to go; told me that we would take the earliest train, and
interested me in thoughts about my packing. About nine o'clock he
came to my room-door, and I heard some one with him. It was the
Doctor.</p>
<p>I turned upon Richard a fierce look, and said, very quietly, he
might go away, for I would not see the Doctor. After that, they
tried me with Sophie, but with less success; and, finally, Richard
came back alone, with a glass in his hand.</p>
<p>"Take this, Pauline, it will make you sleep."</p>
<p>I wanted to sleep very much, so I took it.</p>
<p>Bettina had finished my packing, and had laid my travelling
dress and hat upon a chair.</p>
<p>"Shall Bettina come and sleep on the floor, by your bed?" asked
Richard, anxiously.</p>
<p>"No, I would not have her for the world."</p>
<p>"Maybe you might not wake in time," said Richard, warily.</p>
<p>That was very true: so I let Bettina come. Richard gave her some
instructions at the door, and she came in and arranged things for
the night, and lay down on a mattress at the foot of my bed.</p>
<p>The sedative which the Doctor sent did not work very well. I had
very little sleep, and that full of such hideous, freezing dreams,
that every time I woke, I found Bettina standing by my bed, looking
at me with alarm. I had been screaming and moaning, she said, The
screaming and moaning and sleeping (such as it was), were all over
in about two hours, and then I had the rest of the night to endure,
with the same strange, light feeling in my head--the restlessness
not much, but somewhat abated.</p>
<p>I was very glad that Bettina was in the room, for though she was
sleepy, and always a little stupid, she was human, and I was a
coward, both in the matter of loneliness and of suffering. I made
her sit by me, and take hold of my hand, and I asked her several
times if she had ever been with any one that died, or that--I did
not quite dare to ask her about going mad.</p>
<p>My questions seemed to trouble her. She crossed herself, and
shuddered, and said, No, she had never been with any one that died,
and she prayed the good God never to let her be.</p>
<p>"You'll have to be with one person that dies, Bettina. That's
yourself. You know it's got to come. We've all got to go out at
that gate," and I moaned, and turned my face away.</p>
<p>"Let me call Mr. Richard," said Bettina, very much afraid. I
would have given all the world to have seen Richard then; but I
knew it was impossible, and I said, No, it would soon be
morning.</p>
<p>Long before morning, I heard Richard up and walking about the
house. We were to leave the house at half-past four. By four, all
the trunks, and shawls, and packages, were strapped and ready, and
I was sitting dressed, and waiting by the window.</p>
<p>Bettina liked very much better to pack trunks, and put rooms in
order, than to sit still and hold a person's hot hands, in the
middle of the night, and have dreadful questions asked her; and she
had been very active and efficient. Soon Richard called her to come
down and take my breakfast up to me. I could not eat it, and it was
taken away. Then the carriage came, and the wagon to take the
baggage. Finally, Richard came, and told me it was time to start,
if I were ready.</p>
<p>Sophie came into the room in a wrapper, looking very dutiful and
patient, and said all that was dutiful and civil. But I suppose I
was a fiery trial to her, and she wished, no doubt, that she had
never seen me, or better, that Richard never had. All this I felt,
through her decently framed good-bye, but I did not care at all; to
be out of her sight as soon as possible, was all that I
requested.</p>
<p>When we went down in the hall, Richard looked anxiously at me,
but I did not feel as if I had ever been there before; I really had
no feeling. I said good-bye to Bettina, who was the only servant
that I saw, and Richard put me into the carriage. When, we drove
away, I did not even look back. As we passed out of the gate, I
said to him, "What day of the month is it to-day?"</p>
<p>"It is the first of September," he returned.</p>
<p>"And when did I come here?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Early in June, was it not?" he said. "You know I was not
here."</p>
<p>"Then it is not three months," and I leaned back wearily in the
carriage, and was silent.</p>
<p>Before we reached the city, Richard had good reason to think
that I was very ill. He made me as comfortable as he could, poor
fellow! but I was so restless, I could not keep in one position two
minutes at a time. Several times I turned to him and said, "It is
suffocating in this car; cannot the window be put up?" and when it
was put up, I would seem to feel no relief, and in a few moments,
perhaps, would be shaking with a nervous chill. It must have been a
miserable journey, as I remember it. Once I said to Richard, after
some useless trouble I had put him to, "I am very sorry, Richard, I
don't know how to help it, I feel so dreadfully."</p>
<p>Richard tried to answer, but his voice was husky, and he bent
his head down to arrange the bundle of shawls beneath my feet. I
knew that there were tears in his eyes, and that that was the
reason that he did not speak. It made me strangely, momentarily
grateful.</p>
<p>"How strange that you should be so good," I said dreamily, "when
Sophie is so hateful, and Kilian is so trifling. I think your
mother must have been a good woman."</p>
<p>I had never talked about Richard's mother before, never even
thought whether he had had one or not, in my supreme and
light-hearted selfishness. But the mind, at such a point as I was
then, makes strange plunges out of its own orbit.</p>
<p>"And she died when you were little?"</p>
<p>"Yes, when I was scarcely twelve years old."</p>
<p>"A woman ought to be very good when it makes so much difference
to her children. Richard, did my uncle ever tell you anything about
my mother--what sort of a woman she was, and whether I am like
her?"</p>
<p>"He never said a great deal to me about it," Richard answered,
not looking at me as he talked. "He thinks you are like her, very
strikingly, I believe."</p>
<p>"Think! I haven't even a scrap of a picture of her, and no one
has ever talked to me about her. All I have are some old yellow
letters to my father, written before I was born. I think she loved
my father very much. The noise of these cars makes me feel so
strangely. Can't we go into the one behind? I am sure it cannot be
so bad."</p>
<p>"This is the best car on the train, Pauline. I know the noise is
very bad, but try to bear it for a little while. We shall soon be
there." And so on, through the weary journey.</p>
<p>At one station Richard got out, and I saw him speaking to
several men. I believe he was hoping to find a doctor, for he was
thoroughly frightened.</p>
<p>Before we reached the city I was past being frightened for
myself, for I was suffering too much to think of what might be the
result of my condition. When we left the cars, and Richard put me
in a carriage, the motion of the carriage and its jarring over the
stones were almost unendurable. Richard was too anxious now to say
much to me. The expression of relief on his face as we reached
Varick-street was unspeakable. He hurried up the steps and rang the
bell, then came back for me, and half carried me up the steps.</p>
<p>The door was opened by Ann Coddle, who was thrown into a
helpless state of amazement by seeing me, not knowing why in this
condition I did come, or why I came at all. She shrieked, and
ejaculated, and backed almost down the basement stairs. Richard
sternly told her she was acting like a fool, and ordered her to
show him where Miss Pauline's room was, that he might take her to
it.</p>
<p>"But her room isn't ready," ejaculated Ann, coming to herself,
which was a wretched thing to come to, as poor Richard found.</p>
<p>"Not ready? well, make it ready, then. Go before me and open the
windows, and I will put her on the sofa till you have the bed ready
for her."</p>
<p>"The sofa--oh, Mr. Richard, it's all full of her dear clothes
that have come up from the wash."</p>
<p>"Well, then, take them off--idiot--and do as you are told."</p>
<p>"Oh, Miss Pauline--oh, my poor, dear lamb. Oh, I'm all in a
flutter; I don't know what to do. I'd better call the cook."</p>
<p>"Well, call the cook, then," said Richard, groaning, "only tell
her to be quick."</p>
<p>All this time Richard was supporting me up the stairs. As we
reached the top, Richard called out, "Tell Peter I want him at
once, to take a message for me."</p>
<p>Ann was watching our progress up the stairs, with groans and
ejaculations, forgetting that she was to call the cook. At the
mention of Peter she exclaimed,</p>
<p>"He's laid up with the rheumatism, Mr. Richard. Oh, whatever
shall we do!"</p>
<p>When we reached the middle of the second pair of stairs, I was
almost helpless; Richard took me in his arms, and carried me.</p>
<p>"Is it this door, Pauline dear?" he said, opening the first he
came to.</p>
<p>I should think the room had not been opened since I went away,
it was so warm and close.</p>
<p>Richard carried me to the sofa, and scattered the
<i>lingerie</i> far and wide as he laid me down upon it, and went
to open the windows. Then he went to the bell and pulled it
violently. In a few moments the cook came up (accompanied by Ann).
She was a huge, unwieldy woman, but she had some intelligence, and
knew better than to whimper.</p>
<p>"Miss Pauline is ill," he said, "and I want you to stay by her,
and not leave her for a moment, till I come back. Make that woman
get the room in order instantly, and keep everything as quiet as
you can." To me: "I am going to bring a doctor, and I shall be back
in a few moments. Do not worry, they will take good care of
you."</p>
<p>When I heard Richard shut the carriage-door and drive away
rapidly, I felt as if I were abandoned, and by the time he returned
with the Doctor, I was in a state that warranted them in supposing
me unconscious, tossing and moaning, and uttering inarticulate
words.</p>
<p>The Doctor stood beside me, and talked about me to Richard with
as much freedom as if I had been a corpse.</p>
<p>"I may as well be frank with you," he said, after a few moments
of examination. "I apprehend great trouble from the brain. How long
has she been in this condition?"</p>
<p>"She has been unlike herself since yesterday; as soon as I saw
her, at seven o'clock last night, I noticed she was looking badly.
She answered me in an abstracted, odd way, and was unlike herself,
as I have said. But she had been under much excitement for some
time."</p>
<p>"Tell me, if you please, all about it; and how long she has been
under this excitement."</p>
<p>"She has been often agitated, and quite overstrained in feeling
for some time. Three weeks ago I thought her looking badly. Two
days ago she had a frightful shock--a suicide--which she was the
first to discover. Since then I do not think that she has
slept."</p>
<p>"Ah! poor young lady. She has had a terrible experience, and is
paying for it. Now for what we can do for her. In the first place,
who takes care of her?" with a look about the room.</p>
<p>"You may well ask. I have just brought her home, and find here,
the man-servant ill, one woman too old and inactive to perform much
service, and another to whom I would not trust her for a moment. I
must ask <i>you</i>, who shall I get to take care of her?"</p>
<p>"You have no friend, no one to whom you could send in such a
case? One of life and death,--I hope you understand?"</p>
<p>"None," answered Richard, with a groan. "There is not a person
in the city to whom I could send for help. All my family--all our
friends, are away. Is there no one that can be got for money--any
money? no nurse that you could recommend?"</p>
<p>"I have a list of twenty. Yesterday I sent to every one, for a
dangerous case of hemorrhage, and could not find one disengaged. It
may be to-morrow night before you get on the track of one that is
at liberty, if you hunt the city over. And this girl is in need of
instant care; her life hangs on it, you must see."</p>
<p>"In God's name, then," said Richard, with a groan, pacing up and
down the room, "what am I to do?"</p>
<p>"In <i>His</i> name, if you come, to that," said the Doctor, who
was a good sort of man, notwithstanding his professional cool ways,
"there is a sisterhood, that I am told offer to do things like
this. I never sent to them, for I only heard of it a short time
ago; but if you have no objection to crosses, and caps, and
ritualistic nonsense in its highest flower, I have no doubt, that
they will let you have a sister, and that she'll do good service
here."</p>
<p>"The direction," said Richard, too eager to be civil. "How am I
to get there?"</p>
<p>The Doctor pulled over a pocket-case of loose papers, and at
last found one, which he handed his companion.</p>
<p>"I give you three quarters of an hour to get back," he said. "I
will stay here till then, at all events. Do not waste any time--nor
spare any eloquence," he added to himself, as Richard hurried from
the room.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>The next thing that I recall, is rousing from slumber, or
something related to slumber, and seeing a tall woman in the dress
of a sister, standing by my bed. It was night, and there was a lamp
upon a table near. The unusual dress, and the unfamiliarity of her
whole appearance, made me start and stare at her, half raising
myself in the bed.</p>
<p>"Why did you come here?" I said. "Who sent for you?"</p>
<p>"I came because you were sick and suffering, and I was sent in
the Name ----" and bending her head slightly, she said a Name too
sacred for these pages.</p>
<p>I gave a great sigh of relief, and sank back on my pillow. Her
answer satisfied me, for I was not able to reason. I let her hold
my hand; and all through that dark and troubled time submitted to
her will, and desired her presence, and was soothed by her voice
and touch.</p>
<p>Sister Madeline was not at all the ideal sister, being tall and
dark, and with nothing peculiarly devotional or pensive in her cast
of feature. Her face was a fine, earnest one. Her movements were
full of energy and decision, though not quick or sharp. The whole
impression left was that of one by nature far from humility,
tenderness, devotion; but, by the force of a magnificent faith,
made passionately humble, devout from the very heart, more than
humanly compassionate and tender.</p>
<p>I never felt toward her as if she were "born so"--but as if she
were rescued from the world by some great effort or experience; as
if it were all "made ground," reclaimed from nature by infinite
patience and incessant labor. She lived the life of an angel upon
the earth. I never saw her, by look, by word, or tone, transgress
the least of the commandments, so wonderful was the curb she held
over all her human feelings. Nor was this perfection attained by a
sudden and grand sacrifice; the consecration of herself to the
religious life was not the "single step 'twixt earth and heaven,"
but it was attained by daily and hourly study--by the practice of a
hundred self-denials--by the most accurate science of spiritual
progress.</p>
<p>Doubtless, saints can be made in other ways, but this is one way
they can be made, starting with a sincere intention to serve God.
At least, so I believe, from knowing Sister Madeline.</p>
<p>She made a great change in my life, and I owe her a great deal.
It is not strange I feel enthusiasm for her. I cannot bear to think
what my coming back to life would have been without her.</p>
<p>Of the alarming nature of my illness, I only know that there
were several days when Richard never left the house, but waited,
hour after hour, in the library below, for the news of my
condition, and when even Uncle Leonard came home in the middle of
the day, and walked about the house, silent and unapproachable.</p>
<p>One night--how well I remember it! I had been convalescent, I do
not know how long; I had passed the childish state of interest in
my <i>bouilli</i>, and fretfulness about my <i>peignoir</i>; my
mind had begun to regain its ordinary power, and with the first
efforts of memory and thought had come fearful depression and
despondency. I was so weak, physically, that I could not fight
against this in the least. Sister Madeline came to my bedside, and
found me in an agony of weeping. It was not an easy matter to gain
my confidence, for I thought she knew nothing of me, and I was not
equal to the mental effort of explaining myself; she was only
associated with my illness. But at last she made me understand that
she was not ignorant of a great deal that troubled me.</p>
<p>"Who has told you?" I said, my heart hardening itself against
Richard, who could have spoken of my trouble to a stranger.</p>
<p>"You, yourself," she answered me.</p>
<p>"I have raved?" I said.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And who has heard me?"</p>
<p>"No one else. I sent every one else from the room whenever your
delirium became intelligible."</p>
<p>This made me grateful toward her; and I longed for sympathy. I
threw my arms about her and wept bitterly.</p>
<p>"Then you know that I can never cry enough," I said.</p>
<p>"I do not know that," she answered. After a vain attempt to
soothe me with general words of comfort, she said, with much
wisdom, "Tell me exactly what thought gives you the most pain, now,
at this moment."</p>
<p>"The thought of his dreadful act, and that by it he has lost his
soul."</p>
<p>"We know with Whom all things are possible," she said, "and we
do not know what cloud may have been over his reason at that
moment. Would it comfort you to pray for him?"</p>
<p>"Ought I?" I asked, raising my head.</p>
<p>"I do not know any reason that you ought not," she returned.
"Shall I say some prayers for him now?"</p>
<p>I grasped her hand: she took a little book from her pocket, and
knelt down beside me, holding my hand in hers. Oh, the mercy, the
relief of those prayers! They may not have done him any good, but
they did me. The hopeless grief that was killing me, I "wept it
from my heart" that hour.</p>
<p>"Promise me one thing," I whispered as she rose, "that you will
read that prayer, every hour during the day, to-morrow, by my bed,
whether I am sleeping or awake."</p>
<p>"I promise," she said, and I am sure she kept her word, that day
and many others after it.</p>
<p>During my convalescence, which was slow, I had no other person
near me, and wanted none. Uncle Leonard came in once a day, and
spent a few minutes, much to his discomfort and my disadvantage.
Richard I had not seen at all, and dreaded very much to meet. Ann
Coddle fretted me, and was very little in the room.</p>
<p>Over these days there is a sort of peace. I was entering upon so
much that was new and elevating, under the guidance of Sister
Madeline, and was so entirely influenced by her, that I was brought
out of my trouble wonderfully. Not out of it, of course, but from
under its crushing weight. I know that I am rather easily
influenced, and only too ready to follow those who have won my
love. Therefore, I am in every way thankful that I came at such a
time under the influence of a mind like that of Sister
Madeline.</p>
<p>But the time was approaching for her to go away. I was well
enough to do without her, and she had other duties. The sick-room
peace and indulgence were over, and I must take up the burden of
every-day life again. I was very unhappy, and felt as if I were
without stay or guidance.</p>
<p>"To whom am I to go when I am in doubt?" I said; "you will be so
far away."</p>
<p>"That is what I want to arrange: the next time you are able to
go out, I want to take you to some one who can direct you much
better than I."</p>
<p>"A priest?" I asked. "Tell me one thing: will he give me
absolution?"</p>
<p>"I suppose he will, if he finds that you desire it."</p>
<p>"What would be the use of going to him for anything else?" I
said. "It is the only thing that can give me any comfort."</p>
<p>"All people do not feel so, Pauline."</p>
<p>"But you feel so, dear Sister Madeline, do you not? You can
understand how I am burdened, and how I long to have the bands
undone?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Pauline, I can understand."</p>
<p>I am not inclined to give much weight to my own opinions, and as
for my feelings, I know they were, then, those of a child, and in
many ways will always be. I can only say what comforted me, and
what I longed for. There had always been great force to me, in the
Scripture that says, "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted
unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained," even
before I felt the burden of my sins.</p>
<p>I had once seen the ordination of a priest, and I suppose that
added to the weight of the words ever after in my mind. I never had
any doubt of the power then conferred, and I no sooner felt the
guilt and stain of sin upon my soul, than I yearned to hear the
pardon spoken, that Heaven offered to the penitent. I had been
tangibly smitten; I longed to be tangibly healed.</p>
<p>Whatever shame and pain there was about laying bare my soul
before another, I gladly embraced it, as one poor means at my
command of showing to Him whom I had offended, that my repentance
was actual, that I stopped at no humiliation.</p>
<p>It may very well be that these feelings would find no place in
larger, grander, more self-reliant natures; that what healed my
soul would only wound another. I am not prepared to think that one
remedy is cure for all diseases, but I know what cured mine. I
bless God for "the soothing hand that Love on Conscience laid." I
mark that hour as the beginning of a fresh and favored life; the
dawning of a hope that has not yet lost its power</p>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sunshine, to my night;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;An advent of pure light.<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>The winter that followed seemed very long and uneventful. After
Sister Madeline went away, my days settled themselves into the
routine in which they continued to revolve for many months. I was
as lonely as formerly, save for the companionship of well-chosen
books, and for the direction of another mind, which I felt to be
the truest support and guidance. I was taught to bend to my uncle's
wishes, and to give up constant church-going, and visiting among
the poor, which would have been such a resource and occupation to
me. And so my life, outwardly, was very little changed from former
years--years that I had found almost insupportable, without any
sorrow; and yet, strange to say, I was not unhappy.</p>
<p>My hours were full of little duties, little rules. (I suppose my
heart was in them, or I should have found them irksome.) Above all,
I was not permitted to brood over the past: I was taught to feel
that every thought of it indulged, was a sin, and to be accounted
for as such: I could only remember the one for whom I mourned, on
my knees, in my prayers. This checked, as nothing else could have
done, the morbid tendency of grief, in a lonely, unoccupied,
undisciplined mind. I was thoroughly obedient, and bent myself with
all simplicity to follow the instructions given me. Sometimes they
seemed very irrelevant and useless, but I never rebelled against
any, even one that seemed as hard to flesh and blood as this. And I
have, sooner or later, seen the wisdom of them all, as I have
worked out the problem of my correction.</p>
<p>Obedient as I was, though, and simple as the routine of my life
continued, sometimes there came crises that were beyond my
strength.</p>
<p>I can remember one; it was a furious storm--a day that nailed
one in the house. There was something in the rage without that
disturbed me; I wandered about the house, and found myself unable
to settle to any task. Some one to speak to! Oh, it was so dreary
to be alone. I went into my uncle's room where there were many
books. Among those that were there I found one in French, (I have
no idea how it came there, I am sure my uncle had never read it.) I
carelessly turned it over, and finally became absorbed in it. I
came upon this passage:</p>
<blockquote>Quel plus noir ab&icirc;me d'angoisse y a-t-il an
monde que le coeur d'un suicide? Quand le malheur d'un homme est
d&ucirc; &agrave; quelque circonstance de sa vie, on pent
esp&eacute;rer de l'en voir d&eacute;livrer par un changement qui
pent survenir dans sa position. Mais lorsque ce malheur a sa source
en lui; quand c'est l'&acirc;me elle-m&ecirc;me qui est le tourment

O&ugrave; descendra-t-il qu'il ne s'y suive lui-m&ecirc;me;

Insens&eacute;, dont la folie &eacute;gale la mis&egrave;re, quand

souffre en toi, tu vivras toujours.<br>

ce n'est pas ta place qu'il faut changer, c'est ton coeur. Que tu

A moins que tu ne penses peut-&ecirc;tre, parceque l'oeil de
l'homme n'a rien vu au-del&agrave; de la tombe, que cette vie n'ait

autres le penseraient, toi, tu ne le pourrais pas. Tu as une preuve
d'immortalit&eacute; qui t'appartient en propre. Cette tristesse
qui te consume, est quelque chose de trop intime et de trop profond
pour se dissoudre avec tes organes, et ce qui est capable de tant
souffrir ne pent pas s'aller perdre dans la terre. Les vers
h&eacute;riteront de la poussi&egrave;re de ton corps, mais
l'amertume de ton &acirc;me, qui en h&eacute;ritera? Ces extases
sublimes, ces tourments affreux; ces hauteurs des cieux, ces
profondeurs des ab&icirc;mes; qu'y a-t-il d'assez grand ou d'assez
abaiss&eacute;, d'assez &eacute;lev&eacute; ou d'assez avili pour
les rev&ecirc;tir en ta place? Non, tu ne saurais jamais croire que

<p>It is proof how child-like I had been, how obedient in
suppressing all forbidden thoughts, that these words smote me with
such horror. I had indulged in no speculation; I had never thought
of him as haunted by the self he fled; as still bound to an
inexorable and inextinguishable life,</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"With time and hope behind him cast,<br>
And all his work to do with palsied hands and cold."</blockquote>
<p>The terrors I had had, had been vague. I had thought dimly of
punishment, more keenly of separation. If I had analysed my
thoughts, I suppose I should have found annihilation to have been
my belief--death forever, loss eternal. But this--if this were
truth--(and it smote me as the truth alone can smite), oh, it was
maddening. To my knees! To my knees! Oh, that I might live long
years to pray for him! Oh, that I might stretch out my hands to God
for him, withered with age and shrunk with fasting, and strong but
in faith and final perseverance! Oh, it could not be too late! What
was prayer made for, but for a time like this? What was this little
breath of time, compared with the Eternal Years, that we should
only speak <i>now</i> for each other to our merciful God, and never
speak for each other afterward? Spirits are forever; and is prayer
only for the days of the body?</p>
<p>It was well for me that none of the doubts that are so often
expressed had found any lodgment in my brain; if I had not believed
that I had a right to pray for him, and that my prayers might help
him, I cannot understand how I could have lived through those
nights and days of thought.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>It was now early spring: the days were lengthening and were
growing soft. Lent (late that year) was nearly over. I had begun to
think much about the summer, and to wonder if I were to pass it in
the city. There was one thing that the winter had developed in me,
and that was, a sort of affection for my uncle. I had learned that
I owed him a duty, and had tried to find ways of fulfilling it; had
taken a little interest in the house, and had tried to make him
more comfortable. Also I had prayed very constantly for him, and
perhaps there is no way more certain of establishing an affection,
or at least a charity for another, than that.</p>
<p>In return, he had been a little more human to me than formerly,
had shown some interest in my health, and continued appreciation of
the fact that I was in the house. Once he had talked to me, for
perhaps half an hour, about my mother, for which I was unspeakably
grateful. Several times he had given me a good deal of money, which
I had cared much less about. Latterly he had permitted me to go to
church alone, which had seemed to me must be owing to Richard's
intervention.</p>
<p>Richard had been almost as much as formerly at the house: my
uncle was becoming more and more dependent on him. For myself, I
did not see as much of him as the year before. We were always
together at the table, of course. But the evenings that Richard was
with my uncle, I thought it unnecessary for me to stay down-stairs.
Besides, now, they almost always had writing or business affairs to
occupy them.</p>
<p>It was natural that I should go away, and no one seemed to
notice it. Richard still brought me books, still arranged things
for me with my uncle (as in the matter of going to church alone),
but we had no more talks together by ourselves, and he never asked
me to go anywhere with him. At Christmas he sent me beautiful
flowers, and a picture for my room. Sophie I rarely saw, and only
longed never to see Benny was permitted to come and spend a day
with me, at great intervals, and I enjoyed him more than his mother
or his uncle.</p>
<p>One day my uncle went down to his office in his usual health; at
three o'clock he was brought home senseless, and only lived till
midnight, dying without recovering speech or consciousness. It was
a sudden seizure, but what everybody had expected; everybody was
shocked for the moment, and then wondered that they were. It was
very appalling to me; I was so unhappy, I almost believed I loved
him, and I certainly mourned for him with simplicity and
affection.</p>
<p>The preparations for the funeral were so frightful, and all the
thoughts it brought so unnerving, that I was almost ill. A great
deal came upon me, in trying to manage the wailing servants, and in
helping Richard in arrangements.</p>
<p>It was the day after the funeral; I was tired, out, and had lain
down on the sofa in the dining-room, partly because I hated to be
alone up-stairs, and partly because it was not far from lunch-time,
and I felt too weary to take any needless steps. I don't think ever
in my life before I had lain down on that sofa, or had spent two
hours except, at the table, in that room. It was a most cheerless
room, and no one ever thought of sitting down in it, except at
mealtime. I closed the shutters and darkened it to suit my eyes,
which ached, and I think must have fallen asleep.</p>
<p>The parlor was the room which adjoined the dining-room (only two
large rooms on one floor, as they used to build), and separated
from it by heavy mahogany columns and sliding-doors. These doors
were half-way open, and I was roused by voices in the parlor. As
soon as I recovered myself from the sudden waking, I recognized
Sophie's and then Richard's. I wondered what Richard was doing
up-town at that hour, and so Sophie did too, for she asked him very
plainly.</p>
<p>"I thought I ought to come to see Pauline," she said, "but I did
not suppose I should find you here in the middle of the day."</p>
<p>"There is something that I've got to see Pauline about at once,"
he said, "and so I was obliged to come up-town."</p>
<p>"Nothing has happened?" she said interrogatively.</p>
<p>"No," he answered, evasively.</p>
<p>But she went on: "I suppose it's something in relation to the
will; I hope she's well provided for, poor thing."</p>
<p>"Sophie," said her brother, with a change of tone, "You'll have
to hear it some time, and perhaps you may as well hear it now. It
is that that I have come up-town about; there has been some strange
mistake made; there is no will."</p>
<p>"No will!" echoed Sophie, "Why, you told me once--"</p>
<p>"That he had left her everything. So he told me twice last year;
so I have always believed to be the case. Since the day he died,
the most faithful search has been made; there is not a corner of
his office, of his library, of his room, that I have not hunted
through. He was so methodical in business matters, so exact in the
care of his papers, that I had little hope, after I had gone
through his desk. I cannot understand it. It is altogether dark to
me."</p>
<p>"What can have made him change his mind about it, Richard? Can
he have heard anything about last summer?"</p>
<p>"Not from me, Sophie. But I have sometimes thought he knew, from
allusions that he has made to her mother's marriage, more than once
this winter."</p>
<p>"He was very angry about that, at the time, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I imagine so. The man she married was poor, and a
foreigner: two things he hated. I never heard there was anything
against him but his poverty."</p>
<p>"How can he have heard about Mr. Langenau?" said Sophie,
musingly.</p>
<p>"I think Pauline must have told him," said Richard.</p>
<p>"Pauline? never. She is much too clever; she never told him. You
may be quite sure of <i>that</i>."</p>
<p>"Pauline clever! Poor Pauline!" said Richard, with a short,
sarcastic laugh, which had the effect of making Sophie angry.</p>
<p>"I am willing," she said, "that she should be as stupid and as
good as you can wish--. To whom does the money go?" she added, as
if she had not patience for the other subject.</p>
<p>"To a brother, with whom he had a quarrel, and whom he had not
seen for over sixteen years."</p>
<p>"Incredible!"</p>
<p>"But there had been some sort of a reconciliation, at least an
exchange of letters, within these three months past."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"And it is in consequence of hearing from him, and being pressed
by his lawyer for an immediate settlement of the estate, that I
have come up to tell Pauline, and to prepare her for her changed
prospects."</p>
<p>"And what do you propose to advise?" asked Sophie, with a
chilling voice.</p>
<p>"Heaven knows, Sophie," answered her brother, with a heavy sigh.
"I see nothing ahead for the poor girl, but loneliness and trial.
She is utterly unfit to struggle with the world. And she has not
even a shelter for her head."</p>
<p>"Richard," interrupted his sister, with intensity of feeling in
her voice, "I see what you are trying to persuade yourself: do not
tell me, after what has passed, you still feel that you are bound
to her--"</p>
<p>"<i>Bound!</i>" exclaimed Richard, with a vehemence most strange
in him, as, pacing the room, he stood still before his sister. His
back was toward me. She was so absorbed she did not see me as I
darted past the folding-doors into the hall. As I flew panting up
to my own room, I remember one feeling above all others, the first
feeling of affection toward the house that I had ever had. It was
mine no longer, my home never again; I had no right to stay in it a
moment: my own room was not mine any more--the room where I had
learned to pray, and to try to lead a good life--the room where I
had lain when I was so near to death--the room where Sister
Madeline had led me to such peaceful, quiet thoughts. I had but one
wish now, not to see Richard, to escape Sophie, to get away forever
from this house to which I had no right. I pulled down my hat and
my street things, and dressed so quickly, that I had slipped down
the stairs, and out into the street, before they had ceased talking
in the parlor. I heard their voices, very low, as I passed through
the hall. I fully meant never to come back to the house again--not
to be turned out.</p>
<p>My heart swelled as the door closed behind me. It was dreadful
not to have a home. I was so unused to being in the street alone,
that I felt frightened when I reached the cars and stopped
them.</p>
<p>I was going to Sister Madeline. She would take me, and keep me,
and teach me where to live, and how. I was a little confused, and
got out at the wrong street, and had to walk several blocks before
I reached the house.</p>
<p>The servant at the door met me with an answer that made me
wonder whether there were anything else to happen to me on that
day.</p>
<p>Sister Madeline had been called away--had gone on a long
journey--something about the illness of her brother; and I must not
come inside the door, for a contagious disease was raging, and the
orders were strict that no one be admitted. I had walked so fast,
and in such excitement of feeling, that I was weak and faint when I
turned to go down the steps. Where should I go? I walked on slowly
now, and undecided, for I had no aim.</p>
<p>The clergyman to whom I had gone for direction in matters
spiritual, was ill--for two weeks had given up even Lenten duties.
Anything--but I could not go home, or rather where home had been. I
walked and walked till I was almost fainting, and found myself in
the Park. There the lovely indications of spring, and the quiet,
and the fresh air, soothed me, and I sat down under some trees near
the water, and rested myself. But the same giddy whirl of thoughts
came back, the same incompetency to deal with such strange facts,
and the same confusion. I do not know how long I wandered about;
but I was faint and weary and hungry, and frightened too, for
people were beginning to look at me.</p>
<p>It began to force itself upon me that I must go back to
Varick-street after all, and take a fresh start. Then I began to
think how I should get back, on which side must I go to find the
cars--where was I, literally. Then I sat down to wait, till I
should see some policeman, or some kind-looking person, near me, to
whom I could apply for this very necessary information. In the
meantime I took out my purse to see if I had the proper change.
Verily, not that, nor any change at all! My heart actually stood
still. Yes, it was very true: I had given away, right and left,
during this Lent: caring nothing for money, and being very sure of
more when this was gone. I was literally penniless. I had not even
the money to ride home in the cars.</p>
<p>Till a person has felt this sensation, he has not had one of the
most remarkable experiences of life. To know where you can get
money, to feel that there is some <i>dernier ressort</i> however
hateful to you, is one thing; but to <i>know</i> that you have not
a cent--not a prospect of getting one--not a hope of earning
one--no means of living--this is suffocation. This is the stopping
of that breath that keeps the world alive.</p>
<p>The bench on which I happened to be sitting was one of those
pretty, little, covered seats, which jut out into the lake. I
looked down into the water as I sat with my empty purse in my lap,
and remembered vaguely the many narratives I had seen in the
newspapers about unaccounted-for and unknown suicides. I could see
how it might be inevitable--a sort of pressure, a fatality that
might not be resisted. Even cowardice might be overcome when that
pressure was put on.</p>
<p>It is a very amazing thing to feel that you have no money, nor
any means of getting even eightpence: it chokes you: you feel as if
the wheel had made its last revolution, and there was no power to
make it turn again. It is not any question of pride, or of
independence, when it comes suddenly; it is a feeling of the
inevitable; you do not turn to others. You feel your individual
failure, and you stand alone.</p>
<p>For myself, this was my reflection: I had not even a shelter for
my head; Richard had said so. I had not a cent of money, and I had
no means of earning any. The uncle who was coming to take
possession of the house and furniture, was one whom I had been
taught to distrust and dread. He would, perhaps, not even let me go
into my room again, and would turn me out to-morrow, if he came: my
clothes--were <i>they</i> even mine, or would they be given to me,
if they were? This uncle had reproached Uncle Leonard once for what
he had done for me. I had even an idea that it was about my
mother's marriage that the quarrel had occurred. And hard as I had
regarded Uncle Leonard, he had been the soft-hearted one of the
brothers, who had sheltered the little girl (after he had thrown
off the mother, and broken her poor heart).</p>
<p>The house in Varick-street would be broken up. What would become
of the cook, and Ann Coddle? It would be easier for them to live
than for me.</p>
<p>They could get work to do, for they knew how to work, and people
would employ them. I--I could do nothing, I had been taught to do
nothing. I had never been directed how to hem a handkerchief. I had
tried to dust my room one day, and the effort had tired me
dreadfully, and did not look very well, as a result. I could not
teach. I had been educated in a slipshod way, no one directing
anything about it--just what it occurred to the person who had
charge of me to put before me.</p>
<p>I had intended to throw myself upon Sister Madeline. But what
then? What could she have done for me? I had asked her months
before if I could not be a sister, and had been discouraged both by
her and by my director. I believe they thought I was too young and
too pretty, and, in fact, had no vocation. No doubt they thought I
might soon look upon things differently, when my trouble was a
little older.</p>
<p>And Richard--I did not give Richard many thoughts that day, for
my heart was sore, when I remembered all his words. He had always
thought that I was to be rich; perhaps that had made him so long
patient with me. He had said I was not clever; he had seemed to be
very sorry for me. He might well be. Sophie had asked him if he
were still bound to me. I had not heard all his answer, but he had
spoken in a tone of scorn. I did not want to think about him.</p>
<p>There was no whither to turn myself for help. And the clergyman,
who had been more than kind to me, who had seemed to help me with
words and counsel out of heaven,--he was cut off from my succor,
and I stood alone--I, who was so dependent, so naturally timid, and
so easily mistaken.</p>
<p>It was a dreary hour of my life, that hour that I sat looking
over at the water of the pretty placid lake. I don't like to recall
it. Some one passed by me, gave an exclamation of surprise, and
came back hastily. It was Richard. He seemed so glad, and so
relieved to see me--and to me it was like Heaven opening;
notwithstanding my vindictive thoughts about him, I could have
sprung into his arms; I felt protected, safe, the moment he was by
me. I tried to speak, and then began to cry.</p>
<p>"I've been looking for you these last two hours," he said,
sitting down beside me. "I came up-town to see you, and found you
had gone out. I thought you would not be likely to go anywhere but
to see Sister Madeline, and there the servant told me you had come
this way. I could not find you here, and went back to
Varick-street, then was frightened at hearing you had not come
back, and returned again to look for you. What made you stay so
long? Something has happened. Tell me what you are crying for."</p>
<p>I had no talent for acting, and not much discretion when I was
excited; and he found out very soon that I knew what had befallen
me. (I think he believed that Sophie had told me of it.)</p>
<p>"Were you very much surprised?" he said. "Had you supposed that
you would be his heiress?"</p>
<p>"Why, no. I had not thought anything about it. I am afraid I
have not thought much about anything this winter. I must have been
very ungrateful, as well as childish, for I never have felt as if
it were fortunate that I had a home, and as much money as I wanted.
I did not care anything about being rich, you know--ever."</p>
<p>"No, I know you did not. I was sure you would have been
satisfied with a very moderate provision."</p>
<p>"Oh, Richard," I cried, clasping my hands together, "if he had
left me a little--just a little--just a few hundred dollars, when
he had so much, to have kept me from having to work, when I don't
know how to work, and am such a child."</p>
<p>"Work!" he exclaimed, looking down at me as if I were something
so exquisite and so precious, that the very thought was
profanation. "Work! no, Pauline, you shall not have to work."</p>
<p>"But what can I do?" I said, "I have nothing--and you know it;
not a shelter; not the money to pay for my breakfast to-morrow
morning. Not a person to whom I have a right to go for help; not a
human being who is bound to care for me. Oh, I don't care what
becomes of me; I wish that it were time for me to die."</p>
<p>Richard got up, and paced up and down the little platform with
an absorbed look.</p>
<p>"It was so strange," I went on, "when he seemed this winter to
take a little notice of me, and to want to have me near him. I
really almost thought he cared for me. And when I was so ill last
Fall, don't you remember how often he used to come up to my
room?"</p>
<p>"I remember--yes. It is all very strange."</p>
<p>"And some days early in the winter, when I could scarcely speak
at table, I was so unhappy, he would look at me so long, and seem
to think. And then would be very kind and gentle afterward, and do
something to show he liked me--give me money, you know, as he
always did."</p>
<p>"Tell me, Pauline: did he ever ask you anything about last
summer, or did you ever tell him?"</p>
<p>"No, Richard, I could never have spoken to him about it; and he
never asked me. But I know he saw that I was not happy."</p>
<p>"Pauline," said Richard, after a pause, and as if forcing
himself to speak, "there is no use in disguising from you what your
position is: you know it yourself, enough of it, at least, to make
you understand why I speak now. I don't know of any way out of it,
but one; and I feel as if it were ungenerous to press that on you
now, and, Heaven knows, I would not do it if I could think of
anything else to offer to you. You know, Pauline, that if you will
marry me, you will have everything that you need, as much as if
your uncle had left you everything."</p>
<p>He did not look at me, but paced up and down the platform, and
spoke with a thick, husky voice.</p>
<p>"You know it's been the object of my life, ever since I knew
you, but I don't want that to influence you. I know it is too soon,
a great deal too soon. And I would not have done it, if I could
have seen anything else to do, or if you could have done without
me."</p>
<p>I must have been deadly pale, for when at last he looked at me,
he started.</p>
<p>"I don't know how it is," he said, with a groan, "I always have
to give you pain, when, Heaven knows, I'd give my life to spare you
every suffering. I can't see any other way to take care of you than
the way I tell you of, and yet, I have no doubt you think me cruel,
and selfish, to ask you to do it now. It does seem so, and yet it
is not. If you knew how much it has cost me to speak, you would
believe it."</p>
<p>"I do believe it," I said, trying to command my voice. "I think
you have always been too good and kind to me. But I can't tell you
how this makes me feel. Oh, Richard, isn't there any, any other
way?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps there may be," he said, with a bitter and disappointed
look, "but I do not know of it."</p>
<p>"Oh, Richard, do not be angry with me. Think how hard it is for
me always to be disappointing you. I have a great deal of
trouble!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Pauline, I know you have," he said, sitting down by me,
and taking my hand in a repentant way. "You see I'm selfish, and
only looked at my own disappointment just that minute. I thought I
had not any hope that you might not mind the idea of marrying me;
but you see, after all, I had. I believe I must have fancied that
you were getting over your trouble: you have seemed so much
brighter lately. But now I know the truth; and now I know that what
I do is simply sacrifice and duty. A man must be a fool who looks
for pleasure in marrying a woman who has no love for him. And I say
now, in the face of it all, marry me, Pauline, if you can bring
yourself to do it. I am the only approach to a friend that you have
in the world. As your husband, I can care for you and protect you.
You are young, your character is unformed, you are ignorant of the
world. You have no home, no protection, literally none, and I am
afraid to trust you. You need not be angry if I say so. I think
I've earned the right to find some faults in you. I don't expect
you to love me. I don't expect to be particularly happy; but there
are a good many ways of serving God and doing one's duty; and if we
try to serve him and to live for duty, it will all come out right
at last. You will be a happier woman, Pauline, if you do it, than
if you rebel against it, and try to find some other way, and put
yourself in a subordinate place, or a place of dependence, and
waste your life, and expose yourself to temptation. No, no,
Pauline, I cannot see you do it. Heaven knows, I wish you had
somebody else to direct you. But it has all come upon me, and I
must do the best I can. I think any one else would advise the same,
who had the same means of judging."</p>
<p>"I will do just what you think best," I said, almost in a
whisper, getting up.</p>
<p>"That is right," he answered, in a husky voice, rising too, and
putting my cloak about my shoulders, which had fallen off. "You
will see it will be best."</p>

<p>Richard had obtained for me (with difficulty), from the lawyer
of the new uncle who had arisen, the privilege of remaining in the
house for another month, undisturbed in any way. At the end of
those four weeks I was to be married to him, one day, quietly in
church, and to go away. It was very hard to have to see Sophie, and
be treated with ignominy, for doing what I did not want to do; it
was very hard to make preparations to leave the only place I wanted
to stay in now; it was very hard to be tranquil and even, while my
heart was like lead. But I had begun to discover that that was the
general order of things here below, and it did not amaze me as it
had done at first. I was doing my duty, to the best of my
discernment, and was not to be deterred by all the lead in the
world.</p>
<p>It was very well for Richard to say, he did it for sacrifice and
for duty. I have no doubt at first he did it greatly for those two
things: but he grew happier every day, I could see. He was very
considerate of my sadness, and always acted on the basis on which
our engagement was begun, never keeping my hand in his, or kissing
me, or asking any of the trifling favors of a lover.</p>
<p>He was grave and silent: but I could see the change in his face;
I could see that he was more exacting of every moment that I spent
away from him; he kept near me, and followed me with his eyes, and
seemed never to be satisfied with his possession of me.</p>
<p>He bought me the most beautiful jewels, (he had made great
strides toward fortune in the last six months, and was a rich man
now in earnest,) and though he never clasped them on my throat or
wrist, nor even fitted a ring on my finger, I could feel his eyes
upon me, hungering for a smile, a word of gratitude.</p>
<p>And who would not have been grateful? But it was "too soon, a
great deal too soon," as he had said himself. I was very grateful,
but I would have been glad to die.</p>
<p>I have wondered whether he saw it or not, I rather think not. I
was very submissive and gentle, and tried to be bright, and I think
he was so absorbed in the satisfaction of my promise, so intent
upon his plans for making me happy, and for making me love him,
that he made himself believe there was no heart of lead below the
tranquillity he saw.</p>
<p>It was the third week since my uncle's death. The next week was
to come the marriage, on Wednesday, the 19th of May.</p>
<p>"Marriages in May are not happy," said Ann Coddle.</p>
<p>"I did not need you to tell me that," I thought.</p>
<p>It was on Thursday, the 13th; Richard had come up a little
earlier, in the evening. It grew to be a little earlier every
evening.</p>
<p>"By-and-by he will not go down-town at all, at this rate," I
said to myself, when I heard his ring that night.</p>
<p>I was sitting by the parlor-lamp, with the evening paper in my
lap, of which I had not read a word. He came and sat down by the
table, and we talked a little while. I tried to find things to talk
about, and wondered if it always would be so. I felt as if some day
I should give out entirely, and have to go through bankruptcy. (And
take a fresh start.)</p>
<p>He never seemed to feel the want of talking; I suppose he was
quite satisfied with his thoughts, and with having me beside
him.</p>
<p>By-and-by, he said he should have to go up to the library, and
look over the last of some books of my uncle's, and finish an
inventory that he had begun. Could I not bring my work and sit
there by him? I felt a little selfish, for we were already on the
last week, and I said I thought I would sit in the parlor. I had to
write a letter to Sister Madeline. I had not heard a word from her
yet, though I had written twice.</p>
<p>Why could not I write in the library?</p>
<p>I always liked to be alone when I wrote letters: I could not
think, when any one was in the room. Besides, trying to smile, he
would be sure to talk.</p>
<p>He looked disappointed, and lingered a good while before he went
away. As he rose to go away he threw into my lap a little package,
saying,</p>
<p>"There is some white lace for you. Can't you use it on some of
your clothes? I don't know anything about such things: maybe it
isn't pretty enough, but I thought perhaps it would do for that
lilac silk you talked of."</p>
<p>I opened the package: it was exquisite, fit for a princess; and
as I bent over it, I thought, how dead I must be, that it gave me
no pleasure to know it was my own, for I had loved such baubles so,
a year ago.</p>
<p>"What a mass of it!" I exclaimed, unfolding yard on yard.</p>
<p>"You must always wear lace," he said, throwing one end of it
over my black dress around the shoulder. "I like you in it. I am
tired of those stiff little linen collars."</p>
<p>The lace had given me a little compunction about not spending
the evening with him: but as I had said so, I could not draw back;
so I compromised the matter by going up to the library with him, to
see that he was comfortable, before I came down to write my
letter.</p>
<p>I brought the little student-lamp from my own room and lit it,
and put it on the library-table, and brought him some fresh pens,
and opened the inkstand for him, even pushed up the chair and put a
little footstool by it. Though he was standing by the bookshelves,
and seemed to be engrossed by them, I knew that he was watching me,
filled with content and satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Do you remember where that box of cigars was put?" he said,
turning to me as I paused. That was to keep me longer; for they
were on the shelf, half a yard from where he stood.</p>
<p>I got the cigar-box and put it on the table.</p>
<p>"Now you will want some matches, and this stand is almost
empty." So I took it away with me to my room, and came back with it
filled.</p>
<p>"Is there anything else that I can do?" I said, pausing as I put
it on the table.</p>
<p>"No, Pauline. I believe not. Thank you."</p>
<p>I think that moment Richard was nearer to happiness than he had
ever been before. Poor fellow!</p>
<p>I went down-stairs, feeling quite easy in mind, and sat down to
my letter. That threw me back into the past, for to Sister Madeline
I poured out my heart. An hour went by, and I had forgotten Richard
and the library. I was recalled to the present by hearing some
books fall on the floor (the library was over the parlor); and by
hearing Richard's step heavily crossing the room. I started up,
pushed my letter into my portfolio, and wiped away my tears, quite
frightened that Richard should see me crying. To my surprise, he
came hurriedly down the stairs, passed the parlor-door, opened the
hall-door, and shutting it heavily after him, was gone, without a
word to me. This startled me for a moment, it was so unusual. But
my heart was not enough engaged to be wounded by the slight, and I
very soon returned to my letter and my other thoughts.</p>
<p>When I went up to bed, I stopped in the library, and found the
lamp still burning, the pens unused, a cigar, which had been
lighted, but unsmoked, lying on the table. A book was lying on the
floor at the foot of the bookshelf, where I had left Richard
standing. I picked it up. "This was the last book that Uncle
Leonard ever read," I said to myself, turning its pages over. I
remembered that he had it in his hand the last night of his life,
when I bade him goodnight. I was not in the room the next day, till
he was brought home in a dying state.</p>
<p>Ann had put the books in order, and arranged them, after he went
down-town in the morning.</p>
<p>I wondered whether Richard knew that that was the last book he
had been reading, and I put it by, to tell him of it in the morning
when he came. But in the morning Richard did not come. Unusual
again; and I was for an hour or two surprised. He always found some
excuse for coming on his way down-town: and it was very odd that he
should not want to explain his sudden going away last night. But,
as before, my lack of love made the wound very slight, and in a
little time I had forgotten all about it, and was only thinking
that this was Friday--and that Wednesday was coming very near.</p>

<br>
<p>Dinner-time came, and passed, and still Richard did not come. At
eight o'clock Ann brought the tea, as usual, and it stood nearly an
hour upon the table; and then I told her to take it away.</p>
<p>By this time I had begun to feel uneasy. Something must have
happened. It would necessarily be something uncomfortable, perhaps
something that would frighten me, and give me another shock. And I
dreaded that so; I had had so many. But perhaps, dreadful though it
might be, it would bring me a release. Perhaps Richard was only
angry with me, and <i>that</i> might bring me a release.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock I heard a ring at the bell, and then his step in
the hall. He was slower than usual in coming in; everything made me
feel confused and apprehensive. When he opened the door and
entered, I was trying to command myself, but I forgot all about
myself when I saw <i>him</i>. His face was white, and he looked
haggard and harassed, as if he had gone through a year of suffering
since last night, when I left him with the lamp and cigar in the
library.</p>
<p>I started up and put out my hand. "What is it, Richard? You are
in some trouble."</p>
<p>He said no, and tried to speak in an ordinary tone, sitting down
on the sofa by my chair.</p>
<p>I was confused and thrown back by this, and tried to talk as if
nothing had been said.</p>
<p>"Will you have a cup of tea?" I asked; "Ann has just taken it
away."</p>
<p>He said absently, yes, and I rang for Ann to bring the tea, and
then went to the table to pour it out.</p>
<p>He sat with his face leaning on his hand on the arm of the sofa,
and did not seem to notice me till I carried the cup to him, and
offered it. Then he started, and looked up and took it, asking my
pardon, and thanking me.</p>
<p>"Are you not going to have one yourself?" he said, half
rising.</p>
<p>"No, I don't want any to-night. Tell me if yours is right."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is very nice," he said absently, drinking some. Then
rising suddenly, he put the cup on the mantleshelf, and said to me,
"Send Ann away, I want to talk to you."</p>
<p>I told Ann I would ring for her when I wanted her, and sat down
by the lamp again, with many apprehensions.</p>
<p>"You asked me if anything had happened, Pauline, didn't you?" he
said.</p>
<p>"No," I answered. "But I was sure that something had, from the
way you looked when you came in."</p>
<p>"It is something that--that changes things very much for you,
Pauline," he resumed, with an effort, "and makes all our
arrangements unnecessary--that is, unless you choose."</p>
<p>I looked amazed and frightened, and he went on.</p>
<p>"I made a discovery last night in the library. The will is
found, Pauline."</p>
<p>I started to my feet, with my hands pressed against my heart,
waiting breathlessly for his next word.</p>
<p>"Everything is left to you--and I have come to tell you, you are
free--if you desire to be."</p>
<p>"Oh, thank God! Thank God!" I cried; then covering my face with
my hands, sank back into my seat, and burst into tears.</p>
<p>He turned from me and walked to the other end of the room; each
of us lived much in that little time.</p>
<p>For myself, I had accepted my bondage so meekly, so dutifully,
that I did not know the weight it had been upon me till it was
suddenly taken off. I did not think of him--I could only think,
there was no next Wednesday, and I could stay where I was. It was
like the sudden cessation of dreadful and long-continued pain: it
was Heaven. I was crying for joy. But at last the reaction came,
and I had to think of him.</p>
<p>"Oh, Richard," I cried, going toward him, (he was sitting by the
window, and his hand concealed his eyes.) "I don't know what you
think of me, I hope you can forgive me."</p>
<p>He did not speak, and I felt a dreadful pang of
self-reproach.</p>
<p>"Richard," I said, crying, and taking hold of his hand, "I am
ashamed of myself for being glad. I will marry you yet, if you want
me to. I know how good you have been to me. I know I am ungrateful
and abominable."</p>
<p>Still he did not speak. His very lips were white, and his hand,
when I touched it, did not meet mine or move.</p>
<p>"You are angry with me," I cried, bursting into a flood of
tears. "Oh, how you ought to hate me. Oh, I wish we had never seen
each other. I wish I had been dead before I brought you all this
trouble. Richard, do look at me--do speak to me. Don't you believe
that I am sorry? Don't you know I will do anything you want me
to?"</p>
<p>He seemed to try to speak--moved a little, as a person in pain
might do, but, bending his head a little lower on his hand, was
silent still.</p>
<p>"Richard," I said, after several moments' silence, speaking
thoughtfully--"it has all come to me at last. I begin to see what
you have been to me always, and how badly I have treated you. But
it must have been because I was very young, and did not think. I am
sure my heart was not so bad, and I mean to be different now. You
know I have not had any one to teach me. Will you let me try and
make you happy?"</p>
<p>"No, Pauline," he said at last, speaking with effort. "It is all
over now, and we will never talk of it again."</p>
<p>I was silent for many minutes--standing before him with
irresolution. "If it was right for me to marry you before," I said
at last, "Why is it not right now, if I mean to do my duty?"</p>
<p>"No, it is no longer right, if it ever was," he answered. "I
will not take advantage of your sense of duty now, as I was going
to take advantage of your necessity before. No, you are free, and
it is all at an end."</p>
<p>"You are unjust to yourself. You were not taking advantage of my
necessity. You were saving me, and I am ashamed of myself when I
think of everything. Oh, Richard, where did you learn to be so
good!"</p>
<p>A spasm of pain crossed his face, and he turned away from
me.</p>
<p>"If you give me up," I said timidly, "who will take care of
me?"</p>
<p>"There will be plenty now," he answered bitterly.</p>
<p>"There wasn't anybody yesterday."</p>
<p>"But there will be to-morrow. No, Pauline," he said, lifting his
head and speaking in a firmer voice, "What I thought I was doing,
till this showed me my heart, and how I had deceived myself, I will
do now, even if it kills me. I thought I was acting for your good,
and from a sense of duty: now that I know what is for your good,
and what is my duty, I will go on in that, and nothing shall turn
me from it, so help me Heaven."</p>
<p>"At least you will forgive me," I said, with tears, "for all the
things that I have made you suffer."</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, with some emotion, "I shall forgive you sooner
than I shall forgive myself. I cannot see that you have been to
blame."</p>
<p>"Ah," I cried, hiding my face with shame, when I thought of all
my selfishness and indifference, and the return I had made him for
his devoted love. "I know how I have been to blame; and I am going
to pay you for your goodness and care by breaking your heart for
you--by upsetting all your plans. Oh, Richard! You had better let
it all go on! Think how everybody knows about it!"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "I don't care a straw for that," he said. And
I am sure he did not.</p>
<p>"No," he said firmly, getting up, and walking up and down the
room; "it is all over, and we must make the best of it. I shall
still have everything to do for you under the will; and while you
mustn't expect me to see you often, just for the present time, at
least, you know I shall do everything as faithfully as if nothing
had occurred. You must write to me whenever you think my judgment
or advice would do you any good. And I shall be always looking
after things that you don't understand, and taking care of your
interests, whether you hear from me or not. You'll always be sure
of that, whatever may occur."</p>
<p>"Oh," I faltered, with a sudden frightened feeling of loneliness
and loss, in the midst of my new freedom, "I can't feel as if it
were all over."</p>
<p>"I don't know how this terrible mistake about the will
occurred," he went on, without noticing what I said: "it was only
a--mercy that I found it when I did. It was between the leaves of a
book, an old volume of Tacitus; I took it down to look at the title
for the inventory, and it fell out."</p>
<p>"That was the book he had in his hand when I saw him last, that
night before he died."</p>
<p>"Yes? Then after you went up-stairs I suppose he was thinking of
you, and he took out the will to read it over, and maybe left it
out, meaning to lock it up again in the morning."</p>
<p>"And in the morning he was not well," I said, "and perhaps went
away leaving it lying on the book; I remember, Ann said there were
several papers lying on the table, when she arranged the room."</p>
<p>"No doubt," said Richard, "she shut it up in the book it laid
on, and put it on the shelf. But it is all one how it came about.
The will is all correct and duly executed. One of the witnesses was
a clerk, who returned yesterday from South America, where he had
been gone for several months. The other is lying ill at his home in
Westchester, but I have sent to-day and had his deposition taken.
It is all in order, and there can be no dispute."</p>
<p>I think at that moment I should have been glad if it had been
found invalid. There was something so inevitable and final in
Richard's plain and practical words.</p>
<p>Evidently a great change had come in my life, and I could not
help it if I would. I could not but feel the separation from the
person upon whom I had leaned so long, and who had done everything
for me, and I knew this separation was to be a final one; Richard's
words left no doubt of that.</p>
<p>"What you'd better do," he said, leaning by the mantelpiece, "is
to tell the servants about this--this--change in your plans,
to-morrow; unpack, and settle the house to stay here for the
present. In the course of a couple of months it will be time enough
to make up your mind about where you will live. I think, till the
will is admitted and all that, you had better keep things as they
are, and make no change."</p>
<p>He had been so used to thinking for* me, that he could not give
it up at once. "I will tell Sophie to-morrow," he went on. "It will
not be necessary for you to see her if she should come before she
hears of it from me." (Sophie had an engagement with me to go out
on the following morning. He seemed to to have forgotten
nothing.)</p>
<p>"What will Sophie think of me?" I said, with my eyes on the
floor. "Richard, it looks very bad for me; when I was poor, I was
going to marry you, and now that I have money left me, I am going
to break it off."</p>
<p>"What difference does it make how it looks," he said, "when you
know you have done right? I will tell Sophie the truth, that it was
my doing both times, and that you only yielded to my judgment in
the matter. Besides, if she judges you harshly, it need not make
much matter to you. You will never again be thrown intimately with
her, I suppose."</p>
<p>"No, I suppose not," I said faintly. I was being turned out of
my world very fast, and it was not very clear what I was going to
get in exchange for it (except freedom).</p>
<p>"I will send you up money to-morrow morning," he went on, "to
pay the servants, and all that. The clerk I shall send it by, is
the one that I shall put in charge of your matters. You can always
draw on him for money, or ask him any questions, or call on him for
any service, in case I should be away, or ill, or anything."</p>
<p>"You are going away?" I said interrogatively.</p>
<p>"It is possible, for a while--I don't know. I haven't made up my
mind definitely about what I am going to do. But in case I
<i>should</i> be away, I mean, you are to call on him."</p>
<p>"I understand."</p>
<p>"Anything he tells you, about signing papers, and such things,
you may be sure is all right."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But don't do anything, without consulting me, for anybody else,
remember."</p>
<p>"I'll remember," I said absently and humbly. It was no wonder
Richard felt I needed somebody to take care of me!</p>
<p>"I believe there's nothing else I wanted to say to you," he said
at last, moving from the mantelpiece where he had been standing;
"at least, nothing that I can't write about, when it occurs to
me."</p>
<p>"Oh, Richard!" I said, beginning to cry again, as I knew that
the moment of parting had come, "I don't understand you at all. I
think you take it very calm."</p>
<p>"Isn't that the way to take it?" he said, in a voice that was,
certainly, very calm indeed.</p>
<p>I looked up in his face: he was ten years older. I really was
frightened at the change in him.</p>
<p>"Oh!" I exclaimed, putting my face down in my hands, "I wasn't
worth all I've made you suffer."</p>
<p>"Maybe you weren't," he said simply, "But it wasn't either your
fault or mine--and you couldn't help it--that I wanted you."</p>
<p>He made a quick movement as he passed the table, and my
work-basket fell at his feet, and a little jewel-box rolled across
the floor. It was a ring he had brought me, only three days
before.</p>
<p>He stooped to pick it up, and I saw his features contract as if
in pain, as he laid it back upon the table. And his voice was
unsteady, as he said, not looking at me while he spoke, "I hope you
won't send any of these things back. If there's anything you're
willing to keep, because I gave it to you, I'd like it very much.
The rest send to your church, or somewhere. I don't want to have to
look at them again."</p>
<p>By this time I was sobbing, and, sitting down by the table, had
buried my face on my arms.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry that it makes you feel so," he said, "but it can't be
helped. Don't cry, I can't bear to see you cry. Good-bye, Pauline;
God bless you."</p>
<p>And he was gone. I did not realize it, and did not lift my head,
till I heard the heavy sound of the outer door closing after
him.</p>
<p>Then I knew it was all over, and that things were changed for me
indeed.</p>
<p>"I cannot cry and get over it as you can," he had said.</p>
<p>And if tears would have got me over it, I should have been cured
that night.</p>

<br>
<p>From eighteen to twenty-four--a long step; and it covers the
ground that is generally the brightest and gayest in a woman's
life, and the most decisive. With me it was, in a certain sense,
bright and gay; but the deciding events of my life seemed to have
been crowded into the year, the story of which has just been told.
Of the six years that came after, there is not much to tell. My
character went on forming itself, no doubt, and interiorly I was
growing in one direction or the other; but in external matters,
there is not much of interest.</p>
<p>I had "no end of money," so it seemed to me, and to a good many
other people, I should think, from the way that they paid me court.
I don't see why it did not turn my head, except that I was what
they call religious, and dreadfully afraid of doing wrong. I was
not my own mistress exactly, either, for I had some one to direct
my conscience, though that was the only direction that I ever had.
I had not the smallest restriction as to money from Richard (to
whom the estate was left in trust); and it had been found much to
exceed his expectations, or those of anybody else.</p>
<p>I had the whole world before me, where to go and what to choose;
not very much stability of character, and the greatest ignorance; a
considerable share of good looks, and the love of pleasure
inseparable from youth and health; absolutely no authority, and any
amount of flattery and temptation. I think it must be agreed, it
was a happy thing for me that I was brought under the influence of
Sister Madeline, and that through her I was made to feel most
afraid of sin, and of myself; and that the life within, the growth
in grace, and the keeping clear my conscience, was made to appear
of more consequence than the life without, that was so full of
pleasures and of snares.</p>
<p>I often think now of the obedience with which I would give up a
party, stay at home alone, and read a good book, because I had been
advised to do it, or because it was a certain day; of the
simplicity with which I would pat away a novel, when its interest
was at the height, because it was the hour for me to read something
different, or because it was Friday, or because I was to learn to
give up doing what I wanted to.</p>
<p>These things, trivial in themselves, and never bound upon my
conscience, only offered as advice, had the effect of breaking up
the constant influence of the world, giving me a little time for
thought, and opportunity for self-denial. I cannot help thinking
such things are very useful for young persons, and particularly
those who have only ordinary force and resolution. At least, I
think they were made a means of security to me. I was so in earnest
to do right, that I often thought, in terror for myself, in the
midst of alluring pleasures and delights, it was a pity they had
not let me be a Sister when I wanted to at first. (I really think I
had more vocation than they thought: I could have <i>given up</i>,
to the end of life, without a murmur, if that is what is
necessary.) As to the people who wanted to marry me, I did not care
for any of them, and seemed to have much less coquetry than of old.
They simply did not interest me, (of course, in a few years, I had
outgrown the love that I had supposed to be so immortal.) It was
very pleasant to be always attended to, and to have more constant
homage than any other young woman whom I saw. But as to liking
particularly any of the men themselves, it never occurred to me to
think of it.</p>
<p>I was placed by my fortunate circumstances rather above the
intrigue, and detraction, and heart-burning, that attends the
social struggle for life in ordinary cases. If I were envied, I did
not know it, and I had small reason to envy anybody else, being
quite the queen.</p>
<p>I enjoyed above measure, the bright and pleasant things that I
had at my command: the sunny rooms of my pretty house: the driving,
the sailing, the dancing: all that charms a healthy young taste,
and is innocent. I took journeys, with the ecstasy of youth and of
good health. I never shall forget the pleasure of certain days and
skies, and the enjoyment that I had in nature. In society, I had a
little more weariness, as I grew older, and found a certain want of
interest, as was inevitable. Society isn't all made up of clever
people, and even clever people get to be tiresome in the course of
time. But at twenty-four I was by no means <i>blas&eacute;</i>,
only more addicted to books and journeys, and less enthusiastic
about parties and croquet, though these I could enjoy a little
yet.</p>
<p>I had a pretty house (and re-furnished it very often, which
always gave me pleasure). I had no care, for Richard had arranged
that I should have a very excellent sort of person for duenna, who
had a good deal of tact, and didn't bore me, and was shrewd enough
to make things very smooth. I liked her very much, though I think
now she was something of a hypocrite. But she had enough principle
to make things very respectable, and I never took her for a friend.
We had very pretty little dinners, and little evenings when anybody
wanted them, though the house wasn't very large. My duenna (by name
Throckmorton) liked journeys as well as I did, and never objected
to going anywhere. Altogether we were very comfortable.</p>
<p>The people whom I had known in that first year of my social
existence, had drifted away from me a good deal in this new life.
Sophie I could not help meeting sometimes, for she was still a gay
woman, but I naturally belonged to a younger set, and did not go
very long into general society. We still disliked each other with
the cordiality of our first acquaintance, but I was very sorry for
it, and had a great many repentances about it after every meeting.
Kilian I met a good deal, but we rather avoided each other, at
short range, though exceedingly good friends to the general
observation.</p>
<p>Mary Leighton I seldom saw; no doubt she was consumed with envy
when she heard of me, for they were poor, and not able to keep up
with gay life as would have pleased her. She still maintained her
intimacy with Kilian, for he had not the resolution to break off a
flirtation of which, I was sure, he must be very tired.</p>
<p>Henrietta had married very well, two years after I saw her at
R----, and was the staid, placid matron that she was always meant
to be.</p>
<p>Charlotte Benson was the clever woman still: a little
stronger-minded, and no less good-looking than of old, and no more.
People were beginning to say that she would not marry, though she
was only twenty-six. She did not go much to parties, and was not in
my set. She affected art and lectures, and excursions to mountains,
and campings-out, and unconventionalities, and no doubt had a good
time in her way. But it was not my way: and so we seldom met. When
we did, she did not show much more respect for me than of old,
which always had the effect of making me feel angry.</p>
<p>And as for Richard, we could not have been much further apart,
if he had lived "in England and I at Rotterdam." For a year, while
he was settling up the estate, he was closely in the city. I did
not see him more than once or twice, all business being transacted
through his lawyer, and the clerk of whom he had spoken to me.
After the business matters of the estate were all in order, he went
away, intending, I believe, to stay a year or two. But he came back
before many months were over, and settled down into the routine of
business life, which now seemed to have become necessary to
him.</p>
<p>Travel was only a weariness to him in his state of mind; and
work, and city-life, seemed the panacea. He did not live with
Sophie, but took apartments, which he furnished plainly; and seemed
settling down, according to his brother, into much of the sort of
life that Uncle Leonard had led so many years in Varick-street.</p>
<p>Sophie still went to R----, and I often heard of the pleasant
parties there in summer. But Richard seldom went, and seemed to
have lost his interest in the place, though I have no doubt he
spent more money on it than before. I heard of many improvements
every year.</p>
<p>And Richard was now a man of wealth, so much so that people
talked about him; and the newspapers said, in talking about
real-estate, or investments, or institutions of charity--"When such
men as Richard Vandermarck allow their names to appear, we may be
sure," etc., etc. He was now the head of the firm, and one of the
first business men of the city. He seemed a great deal older than
he was; thirty-seven is young to occupy the place he held.</p>
<p>Such a <i>parti</i> could not be let alone entirely. His course
was certainly discouraging, and it needs tough hopes to live on
nothing. But stranger things had happened; more obdurate men had
yielded; and unappropriated loveliness hoped on. The story of an
early attachment was afloat in connection with his name. I don't
know whether I was made to play a part in it or not.</p>
<p>I saw him, perhaps, twice a year, not oftener. His manner was
always, to me, peculiarly grave and kind; to every one, practical
and unpretending. I had many letters from him, particularly when I
was away on journeys. He seemed always to want to know exactly
where I was, and to feel a care of me, though his letters never
went beyond business matters, and advice about things I did not
understand.</p>
<p>As my guardian, he could not have done less, nor was it
necessary that he should do more; still I often wished it would
occur to him to come and see me oftener, and give me an opportunity
of showing him how much I had improved, and how different I had
become. I had the greatest respect for his opinion; and he had
grown, unconsciously to myself, to be a sort of oracle with me, and
a sort of hero, too.</p>
<p>I was apt to compare other men with him, and they fell very far
short of his measure in my eyes. That may have been because I saw
him much too seldom, and the other men much too often.</p>

<br>
<p>"It's very nice to be at home again," I said to Mrs.
Throckmorton, as I broke a great lump of coal in pieces, and
watched the flames with pleasure.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Throckmorton, putting another piece of sugar in
her coffee, for she was still at the table. "That is, if you call
this home; I must confess it doesn't feel so to me altogether."</p>
<p>"Well, it's our own dear, noisy, raging, racketing, bustling old
city, if it isn't our own house, and I'm sure we're very
comfortable."</p>
<p>"Very," said Mrs. Throckmorton, who was always pleased.</p>
<p>"Every time I hear the tinkle of a car-bell, or the roar of an
omnibus, I feel a thrill of pleasure," I said; "I never was so glad
to get anywhere before."</p>
<p>"That's something new, isn't it?" said Mrs. Throckmorton,
briefly.</p>
<p>"I don't know; I think I am always glad to get back home."</p>
<p>"And very glad to go away again too, my dear."</p>
<p>"I don't think I shall travel any more," I returned. "The fact
is, I am getting too old to care about it, I believe."</p>
<p>Mrs. Throckmorton laughed, being considerably over forty, and
still as fond of going about as ever.</p>
<p>We were only <i>de retour</i> two days. We had started eighteen
months ago, for at least three years in Europe, and I had found
myself unaccountably tired of it at the end of a year and a half;
and here we were.</p>
<p>Our house was rented, but that I had not allowed to be any
obstacle, though Mrs. Throckmorton, who was very well satisfied
with the easy life abroad, had tried to make it so. I had secured
apartments which were very pretty and complete. We had found them
in order, and we had come there from the steamer. I was eminently
happy at being where I wanted to be.</p>
<p>"How odd it seems to be in town and have nobody know it," I
said, thinking, with a little quiet satisfaction, how pleased
several people I could name would be, if they only knew we were so
near them.</p>
<p>"Nobody but Mr. Vandermarck, I suppose," said Mrs.
Throckmorton.</p>
<p>"Not even he," I answered, "for he can't have got my letter yet;
it was only mailed the day we started. It was only a chance, you
know, our getting those staterooms, and we were in such a hurry. I
was so much obliged to that dear, old German gentleman for dying.
We shouldn't have been here if he hadn't."</p>
<p>"Pauline, my dear!"</p>
<p>"Well, I can't think, as he's probably in heaven, that he can
have begrudged us his tickets to New York."</p>
<p>"I should think not," said Mrs. Throckmorton, with a little
sigh. For New York was not heaven to her, and she had spent a good
deal of the day in looking up the necessary servants for our
establishment, which, little as it was, required just double the
number that had made us comfortable abroad.</p>
<p>She had too much discretion to trouble me with her cares,
however, so she said cheerfully, after a few moments, by way of
diverting my mind and her own--</p>
<p>"Well, I heard some news to-day."</p>
<p>"Ah!"--(I had been unpacking all day; and Mrs. Throckmorton in
the interval of servant-hunting had not been able to refrain from a
visit or two, <i>en passant</i> to dear friends.)</p>
<p>"Yes: Kilian Vandermarck was married yesterday."</p>
<p>"Yesterday! how odd. And pray, who has he married? Not Mary
Leighton, I should hope."</p>
<p>"Leighton. Yes, that's the name. No money, and a little
<i>pass&eacute;</i>. Everybody wonders."</p>
<p>"Well, he deserves it. That is even-handed justice, I'm not
sorry for him. He's been trifling all his days, and now he's got
his punishment. It serves Sophie right, too. I know she can't
endure her. She never thought there was the slightest danger. But
I'm sorry for Richard, that he's got to have such a girl related to
him."</p>
<p>"Oh, well," said Mrs. Throckmorton, "I don't know whether
that'll affect him very much, for they say he's going to be married
too."</p>
<p>"Richard!"</p>
<p>"Yes; and to that Benson girl, you know."</p>
<p>"Who told you?"</p>
<p>"Mary Ann. She's heard it half a dozen times, she says. I
believe it's rather an old affair. His sister made it up, I'm told.
The young lady's been spending the summer with them, and this
autumn it came out."</p>
<p>"I don't believe it."</p>
<p>"I'm sure I don't know; only that's the talk. It would be odd,
though, if we'd just come home in time for the wedding. You'll have
to give her something handsome, being your guardian, and all."</p>
<p>I wouldn't give her anything, and she shouldn't marry Richard, I
thought, as I leaned back in my chair and looked into the fire; a
great silence having fallen on us since the delivery of that piece
of news.</p>
<p>I said I didn't believe it, and yet I'm afraid I did. It was so
like a man to give in at last; at least, like any man but Richard.
He had always liked Charlotte Benson, and known how clever she was,
and Sophie had been so set upon it, (particularly since Richard had
had so much money that he had given her a handsome settlement that
nothing would affect.) And now that Kilian was married and would
have the place, unless Richard wanted it, it was natural that
Sophie should approve Richard having <i>his</i> wife there instead
of Kilian having his; Kilian's being one that nobody particularly
approved.</p>
<p>Yes, it did sound very much like probability. I wasn't given to
self-analysis; but I acknowledged to myself, that I was very much
disappointed, and that if I had known that this was going to
happen, I should have stayed in Europe.</p>
<p>I had never felt as if there were any chance of Richard marrying
any one; I had not said to myself, that his love for me still had
an existence, nor had I any reason to believe it. But the truth had
been, I had always felt that he belonged to me, and was my right,
and I felt a bitter resentment toward this woman, who was supposed
to have usurped my place. How <i>dared</i> Richard love anybody
else! I was angry with him, and very much hurt, and very, very
unhappy.</p>
<p>Long after Mrs. Throckmorton went to her middle-aged repose, I
sat up and went through imaginary scenes, and reviewed the
situation a hundred times, and tried to convince myself of what I
wanted to believe, and ended without any satisfaction.</p>
<p>One thing was certain. If Richard was going to marry Charlotte
Benson, he was not going to do it because he loved her. He might
not be prevented from doing it because he loved me; but he did not
love her. I could not say why exactly. But I knew she was not the
kind of woman for him to think of loving, and I would not believe
it till I heard it from himself, and I would hear it from himself
at the earliest possible date. I did not like to be unhappy, and
was very impatient to get rid of this, if it were not true, and to
know the worst, at once, if it were.</p>
<p>"My dear Throcky," I said to my companion, at the
breakfast-table, "I think you'd better go and take dinner with your
niece to-day. I've sent for Mr. Vandermarck to come and dine, and I
thought perhaps you'd rather not be bored; we shall have business
to talk about, and business is such a nuisance when you're not
interested in it."</p>
<p>"Very well, my dear," said Mrs. Throckmorton, with
indestructible good-humor.</p>
<p>"Or you might have a headache, if you'd rather, and I'll send
your dinner up to you. I'll be sure Susan takes you everything
that's nice."</p>
<p>"Well, then, I think I'll have a headache; I'm afraid I'd rather
have it than one of Mary Ann's poor dinners. (I'd be sure of one
to-morrow if I went.)"</p>
<p>"Paris things have spoiled you, I'm afraid," I said. "Only see
that I have something nice for Richard, won't you?--How do you
think the cook is going to do?" This was the first sign of interest
I had given in the matter of <i>m&eacute;nage</i>; by which it will
be seen I was still a little selfish, and not very wise. But
Throckmorton was a person to cultivate my selfishness, and there
had not been much to develop the wisdom of common life.</p>
<p>She promised me a very pretty dinner, no matter at what trouble,
and made me feel quite easy about her wounded feelings. One of the
best features of Throckmorton was, she hadn't any feelings; you
might treat her like a galley-slave, and she would show the least
dejection. It was a temptation to have such a person in the
house.</p>
<p>I had sent a note to Richard which contained the following:</p>
<blockquote>"DEAR RICHARD:<br>
<br>
"I am sure you will be surprised to know we have returned. But the
fact is, I got very tired of Italy; and we were disappointed in the
apartments we wanted in Berlin, and some of the people we expected
to have with us had to give it up, and altogether it seemed dull,
and we thought it would be just as pleasant to come home. We were
able to get staterooms that just suited us, and it didn't seem
worth while to lose them by waiting to send word. We had a very
comfortable voyage, and I am glad to find myself at home, though
Mrs. Throckmorton doesn't think the rooms are very nice. I want to
know if you won't come to dinner. We dine at six. Send a line back
by the boy. I want to ask you about some business matters.<br>
<br>
"Affectionately yours,<br>
<br>
"PAULINE."</blockquote>
<p>And I had received for answer:</p>
<blockquote>"MY DEAR PAULINE:<br>
<br>
"Of course I am astonished to think you are at home. I enclosed you
several letters by the steamer yesterday, none of them of any very
great importance, though, I think. I will come up at six.<br>
<br>
"Always yours,<br>
<br>
"RICHARD VANDERMARCK.<br>
<br>
"P.S. I am very glad you wanted to come home."</blockquote>
<p>I read this letter over a great many times, but it did not
enlighten me at all as to his intentions about marrying Charlotte
Benson. It was very matter-of-fact, but that Richard's letters
always were. Evidently he had thought the same of it himself, as he
read it over, and had added the postscript. But that did not seem
very enthusiastic. Altogether I was not happy, waiting for six
o'clock to come.</p>

<h3>A DINNER</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Time and chance are but a tide,<br>
Slighted love is sair to bide.</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<p>The dining-room and parlor of our little suite adjoined; the
door was standing open between them, as I walked up and down the
parlor, waiting nervously for Richard to arrive. The fire was
bright, and the only light in the parlor was a soft, pretty lamp,
which we had brought from Italy. There were flowers on the table,
and in two or three vases, and the curtains were pretty, and there
were several large mirrors. Outside, it was the twilight of a dark
autumnal day; almost night already, and the lamps were lit. It
lacked several minutes of six when Richard came. I felt very much
agitated when he entered the room. It was a year and a half since I
had seen him: besides, this piece of news! But he looked just the
same as ever, and I had not the self-possession to note whether he
seemed agitated at meeting me. I do not know exactly what we talked
about for the first few moments, probably I was occupied in trying
to excuse myself for coming home so suddenly, for I found Richard
was not altogether pleased at not having been informed, and thought
there must be something yet to tell. He was not used to feminine
caprice, and I began to feel a good deal ashamed of myself. I had
to remind myself, more than once, that I was not responsible to any
one.</p>
<p>"I just felt like it," was such a very weak explanation to offer
to this grave business-man, for disarranging two years of
carefully-laid plans.</p>
<p>I found I was getting to be a little afraid of Richard: we had
been so long apart, and he had grown so much older.</p>
<p>"I hope, at least, you are not going to scold me for it," I said
at last, with a little laugh, feeling that was my best way out of
it. "I shall think you are not glad, to see me."</p>
<p>"I am glad to see you," he said, gravely; "and as to scolding,
it's so long since you've given me an opportunity, I should not
know how to go to work."</p>
<p>"Do you mean, because I've been away so long, or because I've
been so good?"</p>
<p>Susan, who had been watching her opportunity, now appeared in
the dining-room door, and said that dinner was on the table.</p>
<p>Richard asked for Mrs. Throckmorton when we sat down to dinner.
I told him she was dining with her niece. (She had reconsidered the
question of the headache, and had gone to hear more news.) The
dinner was very nice, and very nicely served; but somehow, Richard
did not seem to enjoy it very much, that is, not as I had been in
the habit lately of seeing men enjoy their meals.</p>
<p>"I am afraid you are getting like Uncle Leonard, and only care
about Wall-street," I said. "I shouldn't wonder if you forgot to
order your dinner half the time, and took the same thing for
breakfast every morning in the year."</p>
<p>"That's just exactly how it is," he said. "If Sophie did not
come down to my quarters every week or two, and regulate affairs a
little, I don't know where I should be, in the matter of my
dinners."</p>
<p>"How is Sophie?" I said.</p>
<p>"Very well. I saw her yesterday. I went to put Charley in
College for her."</p>
<p>"I can't think of Charley as a young man."</p>
<p>"Yes, Charley is a strapping fellow, within two inches of my
height."</p>
<p>"Impossible! And where is Benny?"</p>
<p>"At school here in town. His mother will not let him go to
boarding-school. He is a nice boy: I think there's more in him than
Charley."</p>
<p>"And I hear Kilian is married!"</p>
<p>"Yes. Kilian is married--the very day you landed, too."</p>
<p>"Well," I said, with a little dash of temper, "I'm very sorry
for you all. I did not think Kilian was going to be so
foolish."</p>
<p>"He thinks he's very wise, though, all the same," said Richard,
with a smile, which turned into a sigh before he had done
speaking.</p>
<p>"I do dislike her so," I exclaimed, warmly. "There isn't an
honest or straightforward thing about her. She is weak, too; her
only strength is her suppleness and cunning."</p>
<p>"I know you never liked her," said Richard, gravely; "but I hope
you'll try to think better of her now."</p>
<p>"I hope I shall never have to see her," I answered, with angry
warmth.</p>
<p>Richard was silent, and I was very much ashamed of myself a
moment after. I had meant him to see how much improved I was, and
how well disciplined. This was a pretty exhibition! I had not
spoken so of any one for a year, at least. I colored with
mortification and penitence. Richard evidently saw it, and felt
sorry for me, for he said, most kindly,</p>
<p>"I can understand exactly how you feel, Pauline. This marriage
is a great trial to me. I have done all I could to keep Kilian from
throwing himself away, but I might as well have argued with the
winds."</p>
<p>"I don't care how much Kilian throws himself away," I said,
impulsively. "He deserves it for keeping around her all these
years. But I do mind that she is your sister, and that she will be
mistress of the house at R----."</p>
<p>There was an awful silence then. Heavens! what had I been
thinking about to have said that! I had precipitated the
<i>d&eacute;nouement</i>, and I had not meant to. I did not want to
hear it that moment, if he were going to marry Charlotte Benson,
nor did I want to hear it, if he were saving the old place for me.
I felt as if I had given the blow that would bring the whole
structure down, and I waited for the crash in frightened
silence.</p>
<p>In the meantime the business of the table went on. I ate half a
chicken croquette, and Susan placed the salad before Richard, and
another plate. He did not speak till he had put the salad on his
plate; then he said, without looking at me, in a voice a good deal
lower than was usual to him,</p>
<p>"She is not to be mistress of that house. They will live in
town."</p>
<p>Then I felt cold and chilled to my very heart; it was well that
he did not expect me to speak, for I could not have commanded my
voice enough to have concealed my agitation. I knew very well from
that moment that he was going to marry Charlotte Benson. Something
that was said a little later was a confirmation.</p>
<p>I had recovered myself enough to talk about ordinary things, and
to keep strictly to them, too. Richard was talking of the great
heat of the past summer. I had said it had been unparalleled in
France; had he not found it very uncomfortable here in town?</p>
<p>"I have been out of town so much, I can hardly say how it has
been here," he answered. "I was all of August in the country; only
coming to the city twice."</p>
<p>My heart sank: that was just what they had said; he had been a
great deal at home this summer, and she had been there all the
time.</p>
<p>The dinner was becoming terribly <i>ennuyant</i>, and I wished
with all my heart Throckmorton had been contented with just half
the courses. Richard did not seem to enjoy them, and I--I was so
wretched I could scarcely say a word, much less eat a morsel. It
had been a great mistake to invite him to take dinner; it was being
too familiar, when he had put me at such a distance all these
years: I wished for Mrs. Throckmorton with all my heart. Why had I
sent her off? Richard was evidently so constrained, and it was in
such bad taste to have asked him here; it could not help putting
thoughts in both our minds, sitting alone at a table opposite each
other, as we should have been sitting daily if that horrid will had
not been found. He had dined with us just twice before, but that
was at dinner-parties, when there had been ever so many people
between us, and when I had not said six words to him during the
whole evening.</p>
<p>The only excuse I could offer, and that he could understand,
would be that I wanted to talk business to him; I had said in my
note that I wanted to consult him about something, and I must keep
that in mind. I had wanted to ask him about a house I thought of
buying, adjoining the Sisters' Hospital, to enlarge their work; but
I was so wicked and worldly, I felt just then as if I did not care
whether they had a house or not, or whether they did any work.
However, I resolved to speak about it, when we had got away from
the table, if we ever did.</p>
<p>Susan kept bringing dish after dish.</p>
<p>"Oh, we don't want any of that!" I exclaimed, at last,
impatiently; "do take it away, and tell them to send in the
coffee."</p>
<p>I was resolved upon one thing: Richard should tell me of his
engagement before he went away; it would be dishonorable and unkind
if he did not, and I should make him do it. I was not quite sure
that I had self-control enough not to show how it made me feel,
when it came to hearing it all in so many words. But in very truth,
I had not much pride as regarded him; I felt so sore-hearted and
unhappy, I did not care much whether he knew it or suspected
it.</p>
<p>I could not help remembering how little concealment he had made
of his love for me, even when he knew that all the heart I had was
given to another. I would be very careful not to precipitate the
disclosure, however, while we sat at table; it is so disagreeable
to talk to any one on an agitating subject <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>
across a little dinner-table, with a bright light overhead, and a
servant walking around, able to stop and study you from any point
she pleases.</p>
<p>Coffee came at last, though even that, Susan was unwilling to
look upon as the legitimate finale, and had her views about
liqueur, instructed by Throckmorton. But I cut it short by getting
up and saying, "I'm sure you'll be glad to go into the parlor; it
gets warm so soon in these little rooms."</p>
<p>The parlor was very cool and pleasant; a window had been open,
and the air was fresh, and the flowers were delicious, and the lamp
was softer and pleasanter than the gas. I went to break up the coal
and make the fire blaze, and Richard to shut the window down.</p>
<p>When I had pulled a chair up to the fire and seated myself, he
stood leaning on the mantelpiece, on the other side from me. I felt
sure he meant to go, the minute that he could get away--a committee
meeting, no doubt, or some such nauseous fraud. But he should not
go away until he had told me, that was certain.</p>
<p>"What is it that you wanted to ask me about, Pauline?" he said,
rather abruptly.</p>
<p>My heart gave a great thump; how could he have known? Oh, it was
the business that I had spoken of in my stupid note. Yes; and I
began to explain to him what I wanted to do about the hospital.</p>
<p>He looked infinitely relieved. I believe he had an idea it was
something very different. My explanation could not have added much
to his reverence for my business ability. I was very indefinite,
and could not tell him whether it was hundreds or thousands that I
meant.</p>
<p>He said, with a smile, he thought it must be thousands, as city
property was so very high. He was very kind, however, about the
matter, and did not discourage me at all. He always seemed to
approve of my desire to give away in charity, and, within bounds,
always furthered such plans of doing good. He said he would look
into it, and would write me word next week what his impression was;
and then, I think, he meant to go away.</p>
<p>Then I began talking on every subject I could think of, hoping
some of the roads would lead to Rome. But none of them led there,
and I was in despair.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't you want to look at some photographs?" I said, at
last, thinking I saw an opening for my wedge. I got the package,
and he came to the table and looked at them, standing up. They were
naturally of much more interest to me than to him, being of places
and people with which I had so lately been familiar.</p>
<p>But he looked at them very kindly, and asked a good many
questions about them.</p>
<p>"Look at this," I said, handing him an Antwerp peasant-woman in
her hideous bonnet. "Isn't that ridiculously like Charlotte Benson?
I bought it because it was so singular a resemblance."</p>
<p>"It is like her," he said, thoughtfully, looking at it long.
"The mouth is a little larger and the eyes further apart. But it is
a most striking likeness. It might almost have been taken for
her."</p>
<p>"How is she, and when have you seen her?" I said, a little
choked for breath.</p>
<p>"She is very well. I saw her yesterday," he answered, still
looking at the little picture.</p>
<p>"Was she with Sophie this summer?"</p>
<p>"Yes, for almost two months."</p>
<p>"I hope she doesn't keep everybody in order as sharply as she
used to?" I said, with a bitter little laugh.</p>
<p>"I don't know," he said. "I think, perhaps, she is rather less
decided than she used to be."</p>
<p>"Oh, you call it decision, do you? Well, I'm glad I know what it
is. I used to think it hadn't such a pretty name as that."</p>
<p>Richard looked grave; it certainly was not a graceful way to
lead up to congratulations.</p>
<p>"But then, you always liked her," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I always liked her," he answered, simply.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I'm not very amiable," I retorted, "for I never
liked her: no better even than that fraudulent Mary Leighton,
clever and sensible as she always was. There is such a thing as
being too clever, and too sensible, and making yourself an offence
to all less admirable people."</p>
<p>Richard was entirely silent, and, I was sure, was disapproving
of me very much.</p>
<p>"Do you know what I heard yesterday?" I said, In a daring way.
"And I hope you're going to tell me if it's true, to-night?"</p>
<p>"What was it that you heard yesterday?" he asked, without much
change of tone. He had laid down the photograph, and had gone back,
and was leaning by the mantelpiece again.</p>
<p>"Why, I heard that you were going to marry Charlotte Benson. Is
it true?"</p>
<p>I had pushed away the pile of photographs from me, and had
looked up at him when I began, but my voice and courage rather
failed before the end, and my eyes fell. There was a silence--a
silence that seemed to stifle me.</p>
<p>"Why do you ask me that question?" he said, at last, in a low
voice. "Do you believe I am, yourself?"</p>
<p>"No," I cried, springing up, and going over to his side. "No, I
don't believe it. Tell me it isn't true, and promise me you won't
ever, ever marry Charlotte Benson."</p>
<p>The relief was so unspeakable that I didn't care what I said,
and the joy I felt showed itself in my face and voice. I put out my
hand to him when I said "promise me," but he did not take it, and
turned his head away from me.</p>
<p>"I shall not marry Charlotte Benson," he said; "but I cannot
understand what difference it makes to you."</p>
<p>It was now my turn to be silent, and I shrank back a step or two
in great confusion.</p>
<p>He raised his head, and looked steadily at me for a moment, and
then said:</p>
<p>"Pauline, you did a great many things, but I don't think you
ever willingly deceived me. Did you?"</p>
<p>I shook my head without looking lip.</p>
<p>"Then be careful what you do now, and let the past alone," he
said, and his voice was almost stern.</p>
<p>I trembled, and turned pale.</p>
<p>"Women sometimes play with dangerous weapons," he said; "I don't
accuse you of meaning to give pain, but only of forgetting that
some recollections are not to you what they are to me. I never want
to interfere with any one's comfort or enjoyment; I only want to be
let alone. I do very well, and am not unhappy. About marrying, now
or ever, I should have thought you would have known. But let me
tell you once for all: I haven't any thought of it, and shall not
ever have. It is not that I am holding to any foolish hopes. It
would be exactly the same if you were married, or had died. It
simply isn't in my nature to feel the same way a second time.
People are made differently, that is all. I'm very well contented,
and you need never let it worry you."</p>
<p>He was very pale now, and his eyes had an expression I had never
seen in them before.</p>
<p>"Richard," I said, faintly, "I never <i>have</i> deceived you:
believe me now when I tell you, I am sorry from my heart for all
that's past."</p>
<p>"You told me so before, and I did forgive you. I forgave you
fully, and have never had a thought that wasn't kind."</p>
<p>"I know it," I said. "But you do not trust me--you don't ever
come near me, or want to see me."</p>
<p>"You do not know what you are talking of," he answered, turning
from me. "I forgive you anything you may have done at any time to
give me pain. I will do everything I can to serve you, in every way
I can; only do not stir up the past, and let me forget the little
of it that I can forget."</p>
<p>I burst into tears, and put my hands before my face.</p>
<p>"What is it?" he said, uneasily. "You need not be troubled about
me."</p>
<p>Seeing that I did not stop, he said again, "Tell me: is it that
that troubles you?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"What is it, then? Something that I do not know about? Pauline,
you are unhappy, and yet you've everything in the world to make you
happy. I often think, there are not many women have as much."</p>
<p>"The poorest of them are better off than I," I said, without
raising my head.</p>
<p>"Then you are ungrateful," he said, "for you have youth, and
health, and money, and everybody likes you. You could choose from
all the world."</p>
<p>"No, I couldn't," I exclaimed, like a child; "and everybody
doesn't like me,"--and then I cried again, for I was really in
despair, and thought he meant to put me away, memory and all.</p>
<p>"Well, if that's your trouble," he said, with a sigh, "I suppose
I cannot help you; but I'm very sorry."</p>
<p>"Yes, you <i>can</i> help me," I cried imploringly, forgetting
all I ought to have remembered; "if you only would forgive me,
really and in earnest, and be friends again--and let me try--" and
I covered my face with my hands.</p>
<p>"Pauline," he said, standing by my side, and his voice almost
frightened me, it was so strong with feeling; "is this a piece of
sentiment? Do you mean anything? Or am I to be trifled with
again?"</p>
<p>He took hold of my wrists with both his hands, with such force
as to give me pain, and drew them from my face.</p>
<p>"Look at me," he said, "and tell me what you mean; and decide
now--forever and forever. For this is the last time that you will
have a chance to say."</p>
<p>"It's all very well," I said, trying to turn my face away from
him. "It's all very well to talk about loving me yet, and being
just the same; but this isn't the way you used to talk, and I think
it's very hard--"</p>
<p>"That isn't answering me," he said, holding me closer to
him.</p>
<p>"What shall I say," I whispered, hiding my face upon his arm.
"Nothing will ever satisfy you."</p>
<p>"Nothing ever <i>has</i> satisfied me," he said, "--before."</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://gutenberg.net/etext06/">http://gutenberg.net/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:
