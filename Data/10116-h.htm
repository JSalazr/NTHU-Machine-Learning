<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The following Sermons could not be arranged according to any proper
sequence.&nbsp; Those, however, which refer to doctrine and the Church
Seasons will mostly be found at the beginning of the volume, whilst
those which deal with practical subjects are placed at the close.</p>
<p>A few of the Sermons have already appeared in &ldquo;Good Words;&rdquo;
but by far the greater number were never prepared by their author for
the press.&nbsp; They were written out very roughly&mdash;sometimes
at an hour&rsquo;s notice, as occasion demanded&mdash;and were only
intended for delivery from the pulpit.</p>
<p>The original MSS. have been adhered to as closely as possible.</p>
<p>It is thought that many to whom the late Rector of Eversley was dear
will welcome the publication of these earnest words, and find them helpful
in the Christian life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth:
Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their
works do follow them.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON I.&nbsp; ALL SAINTS&rsquo; DAY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; November</i> 1, 1874.</p>
<p>Revelation vii. 9-12.&nbsp; &ldquo;After this I beheld, and, lo,
a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds,
and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb,
clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a
loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb.&nbsp; And all the angels stood round about the throne,
and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne
on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory,
and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto
our God for ever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-day is All Saints&rsquo; Day.&nbsp; On this day we commemorate&mdash;and,
as far as our dull minds will let us, contemplate&mdash;the saints;
the holy ones of God; the pure and the triumphant&mdash;be they who
they may, or whence they may, or where they may.&nbsp; We are not bidden
to define and limit their number.&nbsp; We are expressly told that they
are a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and
kindreds, and peoples, and tongues; and most blessed news that is for
all who love God and man.&nbsp; We are not told, again&mdash;and I beg
you all to mark this well&mdash;that this great multitude consists merely
of those who, according to the popular notion, have &ldquo;gone to heaven,&rdquo;
as it is called, simply because they have not gone to hell.&nbsp; Not
so, not so!&nbsp; The great multitude whom we commemorate on All Saints&rsquo;
Day, are <i>saints</i>.&nbsp; They are the holy ones, the heroes and
heroines of mankind, the elect, the aristocracy of grace.&nbsp; These
are they who have kept themselves unspotted from the world.&nbsp; They
are the pure who have washed their robes, and made them white in the
blood of the Lamb, which is the spirit of self-sacrifice.&nbsp; They
are those who carry the palm-branch of triumph, who have come out of
great tribulation, who have dared, and fought, and suffered for God,
and truth, and right.&nbsp; Nay, there are those among them, and many,
thank God&mdash;weak women, too, among them&mdash;who have resisted
unto blood, striving against sin.</p>
<p>And who are easy-going folk like you and me, that we should arrogate
to ourselves a place in that grand company?&nbsp; Not so!&nbsp; What
we should do on All Saints&rsquo; Day is to place ourselves, with all
humility, if but for an hour, where we can look afar off upon our betters,
and see what they are like, and what they do.</p>
<p>And what are they like, those blessed beings of whom the text speaks?&nbsp;
The Gospel for this day describes them to us; and we may look on that
description as complete, for He who gives it is none other than our
Lord Himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit; for their&rsquo;s
is the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; Blessed are they that mourn: for they
shall be comforted.&nbsp; Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit
the earth.&nbsp; Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness:
for they shall be filled.&nbsp; Blessed are the merciful: for they shall
obtain mercy.&nbsp; Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see
God.&nbsp; Blessed are the peace-makers: for they shall be called the
children of God.&nbsp; Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness&rsquo;
sake: for their&rsquo;s is the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; Blessed are
ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all
manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.&nbsp; Rejoice, and
be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is what they are like; and what we, I fear, too many of us,
are not like.&nbsp; But in proportion as we grow like them, by the grace
of God, just so far shall we enter into the communion of saints, and
understand the bliss of that everlasting All Saints&rsquo; Day which
St John saw in heaven.</p>
<p>And what do they do, those blessed beings?&nbsp; Whatever else they
do, or do not do, this we are told they do&mdash;they worship.&nbsp;
They satisfy, it would seem, in perfection, that mysterious instinct
of devotion&mdash;that inborn craving to look upward and adore, which,
let false philosophy say what it will, proves the most benighted idolater
to be a man, and not a brute&mdash;a spirit, and not a merely natural
thing.</p>
<p>They have worshipped, and so are blest.&nbsp; They have hungered
and thirsted after righteousness, and now they are filled.&nbsp; They
have longed for, toiled for, it may be died for, the true, the beautiful,
and the good; and now they can gaze upward at the perfect reality of
that which they saw on earth, only as in a glass darkly, dimly, and
afar; and can contemplate the utterly free, the utterly beautiful, and
the utterly good in the character of God and the face of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
They entered while on earth into the mystery and the glory of self-sacrifice;
and now they find their bliss in gazing on the one perfect and eternal
sacrifice, and rejoicing in the thought that it is the cause and ground
of the whole universe, even the Lamb slain before the foundation of
the world.</p>
<p>I say not that all things are clear to them.&nbsp; How can they be
to any finite and created being?&nbsp; They, and indeed angels and archangels,
must walk for ever by faith, and not by sight.&nbsp; But if there be
mysteries in the universe still hidden from them, they know who has
opened the sealed book of God&rsquo;s secret counsels, even the Lamb
who is the Lion, and the Lion who is the Lamb; and therefore, if all
things are not clear to them, all things at least are bright, for they
can trust that Lamb and His self-sacrifice.&nbsp; In Him, and through
Him, light will conquer darkness, justice injustice, truth ignorance,
order disorder, love hate, till God be all in all, and pain and sorrow
and evil shall have been exterminated out of a world for which Christ
stooped to die.&nbsp; Therefore they worship; and the very act of worship&mdash;understand
it well&mdash;is that great reward in heaven which our Lord promised
them.&nbsp; Adoration is their very bliss and life.&nbsp; It must be
so.&nbsp; For what keener, what nobler enjoyment for rational and moral
beings, than satisfaction with, and admiration of, a Being better than
themselves?&nbsp; Therefore they worship; and their worship finds a
natural vent in words most fit though few, but all expressing utter
trust and utter satisfaction in the worthiness of God.&nbsp; Therefore
they worship; and by worship enter into communion and harmony not only
with each other, not only with angels and archangels, but with all the
powers of nature, the four beings which are around the throne, and with
every creature which is in heaven and in earth, and under the earth,
and in the sea.&nbsp; For them, likewise, St John heard saying, &ldquo;Blessing
and glory, and honour, and power, be unto Him that sitteth on the throne,
and to the Lamb for ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And why?&nbsp; I think, with all humility, that the key to all these
hymns&mdash;whether of angels or of men, or of mere natural things&mdash;is
the first hymn of all; the hymn which shows that, however grateful to
God for what He has done for them those are whom the Lamb has redeemed
by His blood to God, out of every kindred, and nation, and tongue; yet,
nevertheless, the hymn of hymns is that which speaks not of gratitude,
but of absolute moral admiration&mdash;the hymn which glorifies God,
not for that which He is to man, not for that which He is to the universe,
but for that which He is absolutely and in Himself&mdash;that which
He was before all worlds, and would be still, though the whole universe,
all created things, and time, and space, and matter, and every created
spirit likewise, should be annihilated for ever.&nbsp; And what is that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and
is to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah! what a Gospel lies within those words!&nbsp; A Gospel?&nbsp;
Ay, if you will receive it, the root of all other possible Gospels,
and good news for all created beings.&nbsp; What a Gospel! and what
an everlasting fount of comfort!&nbsp; Surely of those words it is true,
&ldquo;blessed are they who, going through the vale of misery, find
therein a well, and the pools are filled with water.&rdquo;&nbsp; Know
you not what I mean?&nbsp; Happier, perhaps, are you&mdash;the young
at least among you&mdash;if you do not know.&nbsp; But some of you must
know too well.&nbsp; It is to them I speak.&nbsp; Were you never not
merely puzzled&mdash;all thinking men are that&mdash;but crushed and
sickened at moments by the mystery of evil?&nbsp; Sickened by the follies,
the failures, the ferocities, the foulnesses of mankind, for ages upon
ages past?&nbsp; Sickened by the sins of the unholy many&mdash;sickened,
alas! by the imperfections even of the holiest few?&nbsp; And have you
never cried in your hearts with longing, almost with impatience, Surely,
surely, there is an ideal Holy One somewhere, or else how could have
arisen in my mind the conception, however faint, of an ideal holiness?&nbsp;
But where, oh where?&nbsp; Not in the world around, strewed with unholiness.&nbsp;
Not in myself&mdash;unholy too, without and within&mdash;seeming to
myself sometimes the very worst company of all the bad company I meet,
because it is the only bad company from which I cannot escape.&nbsp;
Oh, is there a Holy One, whom I may contemplate with utter delight?
and if so, where is He?&nbsp; Oh, that I might behold, if but for a
moment, His perfect beauty, even though, as in the fable of Semele of
old, the lightning of His glance were death.&nbsp; Nay, more, has it
not happened to some here&mdash;to clergyman, lawyer, physician, perhaps,
alas! to some pure-minded, noble-hearted woman&mdash;to be brought in
contact perforce with that which truly sickens them&mdash;with some
case of human folly, baseness, foulness&mdash;which, however much their
soul revolts from it, they must handle, they must toil over many weeks
and months, in hope that that which is crooked may be made somewhat
straight, till their whole soul was distempered, all but degraded, by
the continual sight of sin, till their eyes seemed full of nothing but
the dance of death, and their ears of the gibbering of madmen, and their
nostrils with the odours of the charnel house, and they longed for one
breath of pure air, one gleam of pure light, one strain of pure music,
to wash their spirits clean from those foul elements into which their
duty had thrust them down perforce?</p>
<p>And then, oh then, has there not come to such an one&mdash;I know
that it has come&mdash;that for which his spirit was athirst, the very
breath of pure air, the very gleam of pure light, the very strain of
pure music, for it is the very music of the spheres, in those same words,
&ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is
to come;&rdquo; and he has answered, with a flush of keenest joy, Yes.&nbsp;
Whatever else is unholy, there is an Holy One, spotless and undefiled,
serene and self-contained.&nbsp; Whatever else I cannot trust, there
is One whom I can trust utterly.&nbsp; Whatever else I am dissatisfied
with, there is One whom I can contemplate with utter satisfaction, and
bathe my stained soul in that eternal fount of purity.&nbsp; And who
is He?&nbsp; Who save the Cause and Maker, and Ruler of all things,
past, present, and to come?&nbsp; Ah, Gospel of all gospels, that God
Himself, the Almighty God, is the eternal and unchangeable realisation
of all that I and all mankind, in our purest and our noblest moments,
have ever dreamed concerning the true, the beautiful, and the good.&nbsp;
Even though He slay me, the unholy, yet will I trust in Him.&nbsp; For
He is Holy, Holy, Holy, and can do nothing to me, or any creature, save
what He <i>ought</i>.&nbsp; For He has created all things, and for His
pleasure they are and were created.</p>
<p>Whosoever has entered, though but for a moment, however faintly,
partially, stupidly, into that thought of thoughts, has entered in so
far into the communion of the elect; and has had his share in the everlasting
All Saints&rsquo; Day which is in heaven.&nbsp; He has been, though
but for a moment, in harmony with the polity of the Living God, the
heavenly Jerusalem; and with an innumerable company of angels, and the
church of the first-born who are written in heaven; and with the spirits
of just men made perfect, and with all past, present, and to come, in
this and in all other worlds, of whom it is written, &ldquo;Blessed
are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; Blessed
are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be
filled.&nbsp; Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.&nbsp;
Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake: for
their&rsquo;s is the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Great indeed is
their reward, for it is no less than the very beatific vision to contemplate
and adore.&nbsp; That supreme moral beauty, of which all earthly beauty,
all nature, all art, all poetry, all music, are but phantoms and parables,
hints and hopes, dim reflected rays of the clear light of that everlasting
day, of which it is written&mdash;that &ldquo;the city had no need of
the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did
lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON II.&nbsp; PREPARATION FOR ADVENT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; November</i> 15, 1874.</p>
<p>Amos iv. 12.&nbsp; &ldquo;Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We read to-day, for the first lesson, parts of the prophecy of Amos.&nbsp;
They are somewhat difficult, here and there, to understand; but nevertheless
Amos is perhaps the grandest of the Hebrew prophets, next to Isaiah.&nbsp;
Rough and homely as his words are, there is a strength, a majesty, and
a terrible earnestness in them, which it is good to listen to; and specially
good now that Advent draws near, and we have to think of the coming
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and what His coming means.&nbsp; &ldquo;Prepare
to meet thy God,&rdquo; says Amos in the text.&nbsp; Perhaps he will
tell us how to meet our God.</p>
<p>Amos is specially the poor man&rsquo;s prophet, for he was a poor
man himself; not a courtier like Isaiah, or a priest like Jeremiah,
or a sage like Daniel; but a herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit
in Tekoa, near Bethlehem, where Amos was born.&nbsp; Yet to this poor
man, looking after sheep and cattle on the downs, and pondering on the
wrongs and misery around, the word of the Lord came, and he knew that
God had spoken to him, and that he must go and speak to men, at the
risk of his life, what God had bidden, against all the nations round
and their kings, and against the king and nobles and priests of Israel,
and the king and nobles and priests of Judah, and tell them that the
day of the Lord is at hand, and that they must prepare to meet their
God.&nbsp; And he said what he felt he must say with a noble freedom,
with a true independence such as the grace of God alone can give.&nbsp;
Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, who was worshipping (absurd as it may
seem to us) God and the golden calf at the same time in King Jeroboam&rsquo;s
court, complained loudly, it would seem, of Amos&rsquo;s plain speaking.&nbsp;
How uncourteous to prophesy that Jeroboam should die by the sword, and
Israel be carried captive out of their own land!&nbsp; Let him go home
into his own land of Judah, and prophesy there; but not prophesy at
Bethel, for it was the king&rsquo;s chapel and the king&rsquo;s court.&nbsp;
Amos went, I presume, in fear of his life.&nbsp; But he left noble words
behind him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was no prophet,&rdquo; he said to Amaziah,
&ldquo;nor a prophet&rsquo;s son, but a herdsman, and a gatherer of
wild figs.&nbsp; And the Lord took me as I followed the flock, and said,
Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he turned
on that smooth court-priest Amaziah, and pronounced against him, in
the name of the Lord, a curse too terrible to be repeated here.</p>
<p>Now what was the secret of this inspired herdsman&rsquo;s strength?&nbsp;
What helped him to face priests, nobles, and kings?&nbsp; What did he
believe?&nbsp; What did he preach?&nbsp; He believed and preached the
kingdom of God and His righteousness; the simple but infinite difference
between right and wrong; and the certain doom of wrong, if wrong was
persisted in.&nbsp; He believed in the kingdom of God.&nbsp; He told
the kings and the people of all the nations round, that they had committed
cruel and outrageous sins, not against the Jews merely, but against
each other.&nbsp; In the case of Moab, the culminating crime was an
insult to the dead.&nbsp; He had burned the bones of the king of Edom
into lime.&nbsp; In the case of Ammon, it was brutal cruelty to captive
women; but in the cases of Gaza, of Tyre, and of Edom, it was slave-making
and slave-trading invasions of Palestine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thus saith the
Lord: For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn
away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole
captivity, to deliver them up to Edom.&nbsp; But I will send a fire
upon the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Slave-hunting and slave-trading wars&mdash;that was and
is an iniquity which the just and merciful Ruler of the earth would
not, and will not, pardon.&nbsp; And honour to those who, as in Africa
of late, put down those foul deeds, wheresoever they are done; who,
at the risk of their own lives, dare free the captives from their chains;
and who, if interfered with in their pious work, dare execute on armed
murderers and manstealers the vengeance of a righteous God.&nbsp; For
the Lord God was their King, and their Judge, whether they knew it or
not.&nbsp; And for three transgressions of theirs, and for four, the
Lord would not turn away their punishment, but would send fire and sword
among them, and they should be carried away captive, as they had carried
others away.&nbsp; But to go back.&nbsp; Amos next turns to his own
countrymen&mdash;to Judah and Israel, who were then two separate nations.&nbsp;
For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, the Lord would not
turn away their punishment, because they had despised the law of the
Lord, and had not walked in His commandments.&nbsp; Therefore He would
send a fire on Judah, and it should devour the palaces of Jerusalem.&nbsp;
But Amos is most bitter against Israel, against the court of King Jeroboam
at Samaria, and against the rich men of Israel, the bulls of Bashan,
as he calls them.&nbsp; For three transgressions, and for four, the
Lord would not turn away their punishment.&nbsp; And why?</p>
<p>Now see what I meant when I said that Amos believed not only in the
kingdom of God, but in the righteousness of God.&nbsp; It was not merely
that they were worshipping idols&mdash;golden calves at Dan, and Bethel,
and Samaria, at the same time that they worshipped the true God.&nbsp;
That was bad, but there was more behind.&nbsp; These men were bad, proud,
luxurious, cruel; they were selling their countrymen for slaves&mdash;selling,
he says so twice, as if it was some notorious and special case, an honest
man for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes.&nbsp; They were lying
down on clothes taken on pledge by every altar.&nbsp; They were breaking
the seventh commandment in an abominable way.&nbsp; They were falsifying
weights and measures, and selling the refuse of the wheat.&nbsp; They
stored up the fruits of violence and robbery in their palaces.&nbsp;
They hated him who rebuked them, and abhorred him that spoke uprightly.&nbsp;
They trod upon the poor and crushed the needy, and then said to their
stewards, &ldquo;Bring wine, and let us drink.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore
though they had built houses of hewn stone, they should not live in
them.&nbsp; They had planted pleasant vineyards, but should not drink
of them.&nbsp; And all the while these superstitious and wicked rich
men were talking of the day of the Lord, and hoping that the day of
the Lord would appear.</p>
<p>You, if you have read your Bibles carefully and reverently, must
surely be aware that the day of the Lord, either in the Old Testament
or in the New, does not mean merely the final day of judgment, but any
striking event, any great crisis in the world&rsquo;s history, which
throws a divine light upon that history, and shows to men&mdash;at least
to those who have eyes wherewith to see&mdash;that verily there is a
God who judges the earth in righteousness, and ministers true judgment
among the people;&mdash;a God whom men, and all their institutions,
should always be prepared to meet, lest coming suddenly, He find them
sleeping.&nbsp; If you are not aware of this, the real meaning of a
day of the Lord, a day of the Son of Man, let me entreat you to go and
search the Scriptures for yourselves; for in them ye think ye have eternal
life, and they are they which testify of the Lord, of that Eternal Son
of whom the second Psalm speaks, in words which mobs and tyrants, the
atheist and the superstitious, are alike willing to forget.</p>
<p>In the time of Amos, the rich tyrants of Israel seem to have meant
by the day of the Lord some vague hope that, in those dark and threatening
times, God would interfere to save them, if they were attacked by foreign
armies.&nbsp; But woe to you that desire the day of the Lord, says Amos
the herdsman.&nbsp; What do you want with it?&nbsp; You will find it
very different from what you expect.&nbsp; There is a day of the Lord
coming, he says, therefore prepare to meet your God.&nbsp; But you are
unprepared, and you will find the day of the Lord very different from
what you expect.&nbsp; It will be a day in which you will learn the
righteousness of God.&nbsp; Because He is righteous He will not suffer
your unrighteousness.&nbsp; Because He is good, He will not permit you
to be bad.&nbsp; The day of the Lord to you will be darkness and not
light, not as you dream deliverance from the invaders, but ruin by the
invaders, from which will be no escape.&nbsp; &ldquo;As if a man did
flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned
his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.&rdquo;&nbsp; There will
be no escape for those wicked men.&nbsp; Though they dug into hell,
God&rsquo;s hand would take them; though they climbed up into heaven,
God would fetch them down; though they hid in the bottom of the sea,
God would command the serpent, and it should bite them.&nbsp; He would
sift the house of Israel among all nations like corn in a sieve, and
not a grain should fall to the earth.&nbsp; And all the sinners among
God&rsquo;s people should die by the sword, who say, &ldquo;The evil
shall not overtake us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was Amos&rsquo;s notion of the kingdom of God and His righteousness.&nbsp;
These Israelites would not obey the laws of God&rsquo;s kingdom, and
be righteous and good.&nbsp; But Amos told them, they could not get
rid of God&rsquo;s kingdom.&nbsp; The Lord was King, in spite of them,
and they would find it out to their sorrow.&nbsp; If they would not
seek His kingdom and His government, His government would seek them
and find them, and find their evil-doings out.&nbsp; If they would not
seek God&rsquo;s righteousness, His righteousness would seek them, and
execute righteous judgment on them.&nbsp; No wonder that the Israelites
thought Amos a most troublesome and insolent person.&nbsp; No wonder
that the smooth priest Amaziah begged him to begone and talk in that
way somewhere else.&nbsp; He saw plainly enough that either Amos must
leave Samaria, or he must leave it.&nbsp; The two could no more work
together than fire and water.&nbsp; Amos wanted to make men repent of
their sins, while Amaziah wanted only to make them easy in their minds;
and no man can do both at once.</p>
<p>So it was then, my friends, and so it will be till the end of this
wicked world.&nbsp; The way to please men, and be popular, always was,
and always will be, Amaziah&rsquo;s way; to tell men that they may worship
God and the golden calf at the same time, that they may worship God
and money, worship God and follow the ways of this wicked world which
suit their fancy and their interest; to tell them the kingdom of God
is not over you now, Christ is not ruling the world now; that the kingdom
of God will only come, when Christ comes at the last day, and meanwhile,
if people will only believe what they are told, and live tolerably respectable
lives, they may behave in all things else as if there was no God, and
no judgments of God.&nbsp; Seeking the righteousness of God, say these
preachers of Amaziah&rsquo;s school, only means, that if Christ&rsquo;s
righteousness is imputed to you need not be righteous yourselves, but
will go to heaven without having been good men here on earth.&nbsp;
That is the comfortable message which the world delights to hear, and
for which the world will pay a high price to its flatterers.</p>
<p>But if any man dares to tell his fellow-men what Amos told them,
and say, The kingdom of God is among you, and within you, and over you,
whether you like or not, and you are in it; the Lord is King, be the
people never so unquiet; and all power is given to Him in heaven and
earth already; and at the last great day, when He comes in glory, He
will show that He has been governing the world and the inhabitants thereof
all along, whether they cared to obey Him or not:&mdash;if he tell men,
that the righteousness of God means this&mdash;to pray for the Spirit
of God and of Christ, that they may be perfect as their Father in heaven
is perfect, and holy as Christ is holy, for without holiness no man
shall see the Lord: if he tell men, that the wrath of God was revealed
from heaven at the fall of man, and has been revealed continuously ever
since, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, that indignation
and wrath, tribulation and anguish will fall upon every soul of man
that doeth evil; and glory, honour, and peace to every man that worketh
good:&mdash;when a man dares to preach that, he is no more likely to
be popular with the wicked world (for it is a wicked world) than Amos
was popular, or St Paul was popular, or our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave
both to Amos and to St Paul their messages, was popular.&nbsp; False
preachers will dislike that man, because he wishes to make sinners uneasy,
while they wish to make them easy.&nbsp; Philosophers, falsely so-called,
will dislike that man, because he talks of the kingdom of God, the providence
of God, and they are busy&mdash;at least, just now&mdash;in telling
men that there is no providence and no God&mdash;at least, no living
God.&nbsp; The covetous and worldly will dislike that man, for they
believe that the world is governed, not by God, but by money.&nbsp;
Politicians will dislike that man, because they think that not God,
but they, govern the world, by those very politics and knavish tricks,
which we pray God to confound, whenever we sing &ldquo;God save the
Queen.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the common people&mdash;the masses&mdash;who
ought to hear such a man gladly, for his words are to them, if they
would understand them, a gospel, and good news of divine hope and deliverance
from sin and ignorance, oppression and misery&mdash;the masses, I say,
will dislike that man, because he tells them that God&rsquo;s will is
law, and must be obeyed at all risks: and the poor fools have got into
their heads just now that not God&rsquo;s will, but the will of the
people, is law, and that not the eternal likeness of God, but whatever
they happen to decide by the majority of the moment, is right.</p>
<p>And so such a preacher will not be popular with the many.&nbsp; They
will dismiss him, at best, as they might a public singer or lecturer,
with compliments and thanks, and so excuse themselves from doing what
he tells them.&nbsp; And he must look for his sincere hearers in the
hearts of those&mdash;and there are such, I verily believe, in this
congregation&mdash;who have a true love and a true fear of Christ, their
incarnate God&mdash;who believe, indeed, that Christ is their King,
and the King of all the earth; who think that to please Him is the most
blessed, as well as the most profitable, thing which man can do; to
displease Him the most horrible, as well as the most dangerous, thing
which man can do; and who, therefore, try to please Him by becoming
like Him, by really renouncing the world and all its mean and false
and selfish ways, and putting on His new pattern of man, which is created
after God&rsquo;s likeness in righteousness and true holiness.&nbsp;
Blessed are they, for of them it is written, &ldquo;Blessed are they
which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Even Christ Himself shall fill them.&nbsp; Blessed are they, and all
that they take in hand, for of them it is written, &ldquo;Blessed are
all they that fear the Lord, and walk in His ways.&nbsp; For thou shalt
eat the labours of thine hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord is righteous
in all His ways, and holy in all His works.&nbsp; The Lord is nigh unto
all them that call upon Him, yea, all such as call upon Him faithfully.&nbsp;
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear Him.&nbsp; He also will
hear their cry&rdquo;&mdash;ay, &ldquo;and will help them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happy, ay, blest will such souls be, let the day of the Lord appear
when it will, or how it will.&nbsp; It may appear&mdash;the day of the
Lord, as it has appeared again and again in history&mdash;in the thunder
of some mighty war.&nbsp; It may appear after some irresistible, though
often silent revolution, whether religious or intellectual, social or
political.&nbsp; It will appear at last, as that great day of days,
which will conclude, so we believe, the drama of human history, and
all men shall give account for their own works.&nbsp; But, however and
whenever it shall appear, they at least will watch its dawning, neither
with the selfish assurance of modern Pharisaism, nor with the abject
terror of medi&aelig;val superstition; but with that manful faith with
which he who sang the 98th Psalm saw the day of the Lord dawn once in
the far east, more than two thousand years ago, and cried with solemn
joy, in the glorious words which you have just heard sung&mdash;words
which the Church of England has embodied in her daily evening service,
in order, I presume, to show her true children how they ought to look
at days of judgment; and so prepare to meet their God:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing,
rejoice, and give thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round
world, and they that dwell therein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful
together before the Lord: for He cometh to judge the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With righteousness shall He judge the world: and the people
with equity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world
without end.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON III.&nbsp; THE PURIFYING HOPE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, 1869.&nbsp; <i>Windsor Castle</i>, 1869.</p>
<p>1 John iii. 2.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beloved, now are we the sons of God,
and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when
he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.&nbsp;
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as
he is pure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us consider this noble text, and see something, at least, of
what it has to tell us.&nbsp; It is, like all God&rsquo;s messages,
all God&rsquo;s laws, ay, like God&rsquo;s world in which we live and
breathe, at once beautiful and awful; full of life-giving hope; but
full, too, of chastening fear.&nbsp; Hope for the glorious future which
it opens to poor human beings like us; fear, lest so great a promise
being left us, we should fall short of it by our own fault.&nbsp; Behold
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed on us, that we should be
called the sons of God.</p>
<p>There is the root and beginning of all Christianity,&mdash;of all
true religion.&nbsp; We are the sons of God, and the infinite, absolute,
eternal Being who made this world, and all worlds, is our Father.&nbsp;
We are the children of God.&nbsp; It is not for us to say who are not
God&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; That is God&rsquo;s concern, not ours.&nbsp;
All that we have to do with, is the awful and blessed fact that we are.&nbsp;
We were baptised into God&rsquo;s kingdom, in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Let us believe the Gospel
and good news which baptism brings us, and say each of us;&mdash;Not
for our own goodness and deserving; not for our own faith or assurance;
not for anything which we have thought, felt, or done, but simply out
of the free grace and love of God, seeking out us unconscious infants,
we are children of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beloved now are we the sons of
God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be.&rdquo;&nbsp; It doth
not yet appear what the next life will be like, or what we shall be
like in it.&nbsp; That there will be a next life,&mdash;that death does
not end all for us, the New Testament tells us.&nbsp; Yea, our own hearts
and reasons tell us.&nbsp; That sentiment of immortality, that instinct
that the death of our body will not, cannot destroy our souls, or ourselves&mdash;all
men have had that, except a few; and it is a question whether they had
it not once, and have only lost it by giving way to their brute animal
nature.&nbsp; But be that as it may, it concerns us, I think, very little.&nbsp;
For we at least believe that we shall live again.&nbsp; That we shall
live again in some state or other, is as certain to our minds as it
was to the minds of our forefathers, even while they were heathens;
as certain to us as it is that we are alive now.&nbsp; But in that future
state, what we shall be like, we know not.&nbsp; St. John says that
he did not know; and we certainly have no more means of knowing than
St. John.</p>
<p>Therefore let us not feed our fancies with pictures of what the next
world will be like,&mdash;pictures, I say, which are but waking dreams
of men, intruding into those things which they have not seen, vainly
puffed up in their fleshly minds&mdash;that is in their animal and mortal
brain.&nbsp; Let us be content with what St. John tells us, which is
a matter not for our brains, but for our hearts; not for our imaginations,
but for our conscience, which is indeed our highest reason.&nbsp; Whatever
we do not know about the next world, this, he says, we do know,&mdash;that
when God in Christ shall appear, we shall be like Him.&nbsp; Like God.&nbsp;
No more: No: but no less.&nbsp; To be like God, it appears, is the very
end and aim of our being.&nbsp; That we might be like God, God our Father
sent us forth from His eternal bosom, which is the ground of all life,
in heaven and in earth.&nbsp; That we might be like God, He clothed
us in mortal flesh, and sent us into this world of sense.&nbsp; That
we might be like God, He called us, from our infancy, into His Church.&nbsp;
That we might be like God, He gave us the divine sense of right and
wrong; and more, by the inspiration of His holy spirit, that inward
witness, that Light of God, which lightens every man that cometh into
the world, He taught us to love the right and hate the wrong.&nbsp;
That we might be like God, God is educating us from our cradle to our
grave, by every event, even the smallest, which happens to us.&nbsp;
That we might be like God, it is in God that we live, and move, and
have our being; that as the raindrop which falls from heaven, rises
again surely, soon or late, to heaven again; so each soul of man, coming
forth from God at first, should return again to God, as many of them
as have eternal life, having become like to God from whom it came at
first.&nbsp; And how shall we become like God? or rather like Christ
who is both God and man?&nbsp; To become like God the Father,&mdash;that
is impossible for finite and created beings as we are.&nbsp; But to
become somewhat, at least, like God the Son, like Jesus Christ our Lord,
who is the brightness of His Father&rsquo;s glory, and the express image
of His person, that is not impossible.&nbsp; For He has revealed Himself
as a man, in the soul and body of a man, that our sinful souls might
be made like His pure soul; our sinful bodies like His glorious body;
and that so He might be the first born among many brethren.&nbsp; And
how?&nbsp; &ldquo;We know that when He appears, we shall be like Him,
for we shall see Him as He is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For we shall see Him as He is.&nbsp; Herein is a great mystery, and
one which I do not pretend to fathom.&nbsp; Only this I can try to do&mdash;to
shew how it may seem possible and reasonable, from what is called analogy,
that is by judging of an unknown thing from a known thing, which is,
at least, something like it.&nbsp; Now do we not all know how apt we
are to become like those whom we see, with whom we spend our hours&mdash;and,
above all, like those whom we admire and honour?&nbsp; For good and
for evil, alas!&nbsp; For evil&mdash;for those who associate with evil
or frivolous persons are too apt to catch not only their low tone, but
their very manner, their very expression of face, speaking, and thinking,
and acting.&nbsp; Not only do they become scornful, if they live with
scorners; false, if they live with liars; mean, if they live with covetous
men; but they will actually catch the very look of their faces.&nbsp;
The companions of affected, frivolous people, men or women, grow to
look affected frivolous.&nbsp; Indulging in the same passions, they
mould their own countenances and their very walk, also the very tones
of their voice, as well as their dress, into the likeness of those with
whom they associate, nay, of those whose fashions (as they are called)
they know merely by books and pictures.&nbsp; But thank God, who has
put into the hearts of Christian people the tendency towards God&mdash;just
in the same way does good company tend to make men good; high-minded
company to make them high-minded; kindly company to make them kindly;
modest company to make them modest; honourable company to make them
honourable; and pure company to make them pure.&nbsp; If the young man
or woman live with such, look up to such as their ideal, that is, the
pattern which they ought to emulate&mdash;then, as a fact, the Spirit
of God working in them does mould them into something of the likeness
of those whom they admire and love.&nbsp; I have lived long enough to
see more than one man of real genius stamp his own character, thought,
even his very manner of speaking, for good or for evil, on a whole school
or party of his disciples.&nbsp; It has been said, and truly, I believe,
that children cannot be brought up among beautiful pictures,&mdash;I
believe, even among any beautiful sights and sounds,&mdash;without the
very expression of their faces becoming more beautiful, purer, gentler,
nobler; so that in them are fulfilled the words of the great and holy
Poet concerning the maiden brought up according to God, and the laws
of God&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And she shall bend her ear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
many a secret place,<br />Where rivulets dance their wayward round,<br />And
beauty, born of murmuring sound,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall pass into
her face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>But if mere human beings can have this &ldquo;personal influence,&rdquo;
as it is called, over each others&rsquo; characters, if even inanimate
things, if they be beautiful, can have it&mdash;what must be the personal
influence of our Lord Jesus Christ?&nbsp; Of Him, who is the Man of
all men, the Son of Man, the perfect and ideal Man&mdash;and more, who
is very God of very God; the Author of all life, power, wisdom, genius,
in every human being, whether they use to good, or abuse to ill, His
divine gifts; the Author, too, of all natural beauty, from the sun over
our heads to the flower beneath our feet?&nbsp; Think of that steadily,
accurately, rationally.&nbsp; Think of who Christ is, and what Christ
is&mdash;and then think what His personal influence must be&mdash;quite
infinite, boundless, miraculous.&nbsp; So that the very blessedness
of heaven will not be merely the sight of our Lord; it will be the being
made holy, and kept holy, by that sight.&nbsp; If only we be fit for
it.&nbsp; For let us ask ourselves the question,&mdash;If St John&rsquo;s
words come true of us, if we should see Him as He is, would the sight
of His all-glorious countenance warm us into such life, love, longing
for virtue and usefulness, as we never felt before?&nbsp; Or would it
crush us into the very earth with utter shame and humiliation, full
and awful knowledge of how weak and foolish, sinful and unworthy we
were?&mdash;as it does to Gerontius in the poem, when he dreams that,
after death, he demanded, rashly and ambitiously, to see our Lord, and
had his wish.</p>
<p>That is the question which every one must try to answer for himself
in fear and trembling, for, he that hath this hope in Him purifieth
himself, even as He is pure.&nbsp; The common sense of men&mdash;which
is often their conscience and highest reason&mdash;has taught them this,
more or less clearly, in all countries and all ages.&nbsp; There are
very few religions which have not made purifying of some kind a part
of their duty.&nbsp; The very savage, when he enters (as he fancies)
the presence of his god, will wash and adorn himself that he may be
fit, poor creature, for meeting the paltry god which he has invented
out of his own brain; and he is right as far as he goes.&nbsp; The Englishman,
when he dresses himself in his best to go to church, obeys the same
reasonable instinct.&nbsp; And, indeed, is not holy baptism a sign that
this instinct is a true one?&mdash;that if God be pure, he who enters
the presence of God must purify himself, even as God is pure?&nbsp;
Else why, when each person, whether infant or adult, is received into
Christ&rsquo;s Church, is washing with water, whether by sprinkling,
as now, or, as of old, by immersion, the very sign and sacrament of
his being received into God&rsquo;s kingdom?&nbsp; The instinct, I say,
is reasonable, and has its root in the very heart of man.&nbsp; Whatsoever
we respect and admire we shall also try to copy, if it be only for a
time.&nbsp; If we are going into the presence of a wiser man than ourselves,
we shall surely recollect and summon up what little wisdom or knowledge
we may have; if into the presence of a holier person, we shall try to
call up in ourselves those better and more serious thoughts which we
so often forget, that we may be, even for a few minutes, fit for that
good company.&nbsp; And if we go into the presence of a purer person
than ourselves, we shall surely (unless we be base and brutal) call
up our purest and noblest thoughts, and try to purify ourselves, even
as they are pure.&nbsp; It is true what poets have said again and again,
that there are women whose mere presence, whose mere look, drives all
bad thoughts away&mdash;women before whom men dare no more speak, or
act, nay, even think, basely, than they would dare before the angels
of God.</p>
<p>But if it be so&mdash;and so it is&mdash;what must we be, to be fit
to appear before Him who is Purity itself?&mdash;before that spotless
Christ in whom is no sin and who knows what is in man; who is quick
and piercing as a two-edged sword, even to the dividing asunder of the
joints and marrow, so that all things are naked and open in the sight
of Him with whom we have to do?&nbsp; What purity can we bring into
His presence which will not seem impure to Him?&nbsp; What wisdom which
will not seem folly?&nbsp; What humility which will not seem self-conceit?&nbsp;
What justice which will not seem unjust?&nbsp; What love which will
not seem hardness of heart, in the sight of Him who charges His angels
with folly, and the very heavens are not clean in His sight?&nbsp; Who
loved Him better, and whom did He love better, than St John?&nbsp; Yet,
what befel St John when, in the spirit, he saw Him even somewhat as
He is?&mdash;&ldquo;And I fell at His feet as dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; If
St John himself was struck down with awe, what shall we feel, even the
best and purest among us?&nbsp; All we can do is to cast ourselves,
now and for ever, in life, in death, and in the day of judgment, on
His boundless mercy and love&mdash;who stooped from heaven to die for
us and cry, God be merciful to me a sinner.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have many fears for some who are ready enough to talk
of their fulness of hope and their assurance of salvation, and to join
in hymns which express weariness of this life and longings for the joys
of heaven, and prayers that they may depart and be with Christ.&nbsp;
If they are not in earnest in such words they mock God; but if they
are in earnest, some of them, I fear much, tempt God.&nbsp; What if
He took them at their word?&nbsp; What if He gave them their wish?&nbsp;
What if they departed and entered the presence of Christ, only to meet
with a worse fate than that of Gerontius?&nbsp; Only to be overwhelmed
with shame and terror, because, though they have been talking of being
with Christ, they have not been trying to be like Christ; because they
have not sought after holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord;
because they have not tried to purify themselves, even as He is pure;
and have, poor, heedless souls, gone out of the world, with all their
sins upon their head, to enter a place for which they will find themselves
utterly unfit, because it is a place into which nothing can enter which
defileth, or committeth abomination, or maketh a lie, and from which
the covetous are specially excluded; and in which will be fulfilled
the parable of the man who came to the feast, not having on a wedding
garment,&mdash;Take him, bind him hand and foot, and cast him into the
outer darkness.&nbsp; There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>Assurance, my friends, may be reasonable enough when it is founded
on repentance and hatred of evil, and love and practice of what is good.&nbsp;
But, again, assurance may be as unreasonable as it is offensive.&nbsp;
We blame a man who has too much assurance about earthly things.&nbsp;
Let us beware that we have not too much assurance about heavenly things.&nbsp;
For our assurance will surely be too great, unreasonable, built upon
the sand, if it be built on mere self-conceit of our own orthodoxy,
and our own privileges, or our own special connection with God.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it has been my comfort to meet with some&mdash;would God
they were more numerous&mdash;who, instead of talking of their assurance
of salvation, lived in a state of noble self-discontent and holy humility;
who could see nothing but their own faults and failings; who, though
they were holier than others, considered themselves as unholy; though
they were doing more good than others, thought themselves useless; whose
standard of duty was so lofty, that they could think of nothing, but
how far they had failed in reaching it; who measured themselves, not
by other men, but by Christ Himself; and, doing that, had nought to
say, save, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; And for
such people I have had full assurance, just because they had no assurance
themselves.&nbsp; And I have said in my heart, These are worthy, just
because they think themselves unworthy.&nbsp; These are fit to appear
in the presence of God, just because they believe themselves unfit.&nbsp;
These are they who will cry at the day of judgment, in wondering humility,&mdash;Lord,
when saw we Thee hungry, or thirsty, or naked, or in prison, and visited
Thee?&nbsp; And will receive for answer,&mdash;&ldquo;Inasmuch as ye
have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done
it unto Me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hast been faithful over a few things,
I will make thee ruler over many things.&nbsp; Enter into the joy of
thy Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which end may God of His mercy bring us, and all we love.&nbsp;
Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON IV.&nbsp; THE LORD COMING TO HIS TEMPLE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; November</i>, 1874.</p>
<p>Malachi iii. 1, 2.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly
come to His temple. . . .&nbsp; But who may abide the day of His coming?
and who shall stand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner&rsquo;s
fire, and like fuller&rsquo;s sope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We believe that this prophecy was fulfilled at the first coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; We believe that it will be fulfilled again,
in that great day when He shall judge the quick and the dead.&nbsp;
But it is of neither of these events I wish to speak to you just now.&nbsp;
I wish to speak of an event which has not (as far as we know) happened;
which will probably never happen; but which is still perfectly possible;
and one, too, which it is good for us to face now and then, and ask
ourselves, If this thing came to pass, what should I think, and what
should I do?</p>
<p>I shall touch the question with all reverence and caution.&nbsp;
I shall try to tread lightly, as one who is indeed on hallowed ground.&nbsp;
For the question which I have dared to ask you and myself is none other
than this&mdash;If the Lord suddenly came to this temple, or any other
in this land; if He appeared among us, as He did in Judea eighteen hundred
years ago, what should we think of Him?&nbsp; Should we recognise, or
should we reject, our Saviour and our Lord?&nbsp; It is an awful thought,
the more we look at it.&nbsp; But for that very reason it may be the
more fit to be asked, once and for all.</p>
<p>Now, to put this question safely and honestly, we must keep within
those words which I just said&mdash;as He appeared in Judea eighteen
hundred years ago.&nbsp; We must limit our fancy to the historic Christ,
to the sayings, doings, character which are handed down to us in the
four Gospels; and ask ourselves nothing but&mdash;What should I think
if such a personage were to meet me now?&nbsp; To imagine Him&mdash;as
has been too often done&mdash;as doing deeds, speaking words, and even
worse, entertaining motives, which are not written in the four Gospels,
is as unfair morally, as it is illogical critically.&nbsp; It creates
a phantom, a fictitious character, and calls that Christ.&nbsp; It makes
each writer, each thinker&mdash;or rather dreamer&mdash;however shallow
his heart and stupid his brain&mdash;and all our hearts are but too
shallow, and all our brains too stupid&mdash;the measure of a personage
so vast and so unique, that all Christendom for eighteen hundred years
has seen in Him, and we of course hold seen truly, the Incarnate God.&nbsp;
No; we must think of nothing save what is set down in Holy Writ.</p>
<p>And yet, alas! we cannot use in our days, that which eighteen hundred
years ago was the most simple and obvious test of our Lord&rsquo;s truthfulness,
namely His miraculous powers.&nbsp; The folly and sin of man have robbed
us of what is, as it were, one of the natural rights of reasoning, man.&nbsp;
Lying prodigies and juggleries, forged and pretended miracles, even&mdash;oh,
shame!&mdash;imitations of His most sacred wounds, have, up to our own
time, made all rational men more and more afraid of aught which seems
to savour of the miraculous; till most of us, I think, would have to
ask forgiveness&mdash;as I myself should have to ask,&mdash;if, tantalized
and insulted again and again by counterfeit miracles, we failed to recognise
real miracles, and Him who performed them.&nbsp; Therefore, for good
or evil, we should be driven back upon that test alone, which, after
all, perhaps, is the most sure as well as the most convincing&mdash;the
moral test&mdash;the test of character.&nbsp; What manner of personage
would He be did He condescend to appear among us?&nbsp; Of that, thank
God, the Gospels ought to leave us in no doubt.&nbsp; What acts He might
condescend to perform, what words He might condescend to speak, it is
not for such beings as we to guess.&nbsp; But how He would demean Himself
we know; for Holy Writ has told us how He demeaned Himself in Judea
eighteen hundred years ago; and He is the same yesterday, to-day, and
for ever, and can be only like Himself.&nbsp; But should we know Him
merely by His bearing and character?&nbsp; Should we see in Him an utterly
ideal personage&mdash;The Son of Man, and therefore, ere we lost sight
of Him once more, the Son of God?&nbsp; Let us think.&nbsp; First, therefore,
we must believe that&mdash;as in Judea of old&mdash;Christ would meet
men with all consideration and courtesy.&nbsp; He would not break the
bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax.&nbsp; He would not strive,
nor cry, nor let His voice be heard in the streets.&nbsp; He would not
cause any of God&rsquo;s little ones to offend, to stumble.&nbsp; In
plain words, He would not shock and repel them by any conduct of His.&nbsp;
Therefore, as in Judea of old, He would be careful of, even indulgent
to, the usages of society, as long as they were innocent.&nbsp; He would
never outrage the code of manners, however imperfect, however conventional,
which this or any other civilised nation may have agreed on, to express
and keep up respect, self-restraint, delicacy, of man toward man, of
man toward woman, of the young ward the old, of the living toward the
dead.&nbsp; No.</p>
<p>As I said just now, He would never cause, by any act or word of His,
one of God&rsquo;s little ones to stumble and fall away.</p>
<p>I used just now that word <i>manners</i>.&nbsp; Let me beg your very
serious attention to it.&nbsp; I use it, remember, in its true, its
ancient&mdash;that is, in its moral and spiritual sense.&nbsp; I use
it as the old Greeks, the old Romans, used their corresponding words;
as our wise forefathers used it, when they said well, that &ldquo;Manners
maketh man;&rdquo; that manners are at once the efficient cause of a
man&rsquo;s success, and the proof of his deserving to succeed: the
outward and visible sign of whatsoever inward and spiritual grace, or
disgrace, there may be in him.&nbsp; I mean by the word what our Lord
meant when He reproved the pushing and vulgar arrogance of the Scribes
and Pharisees, and laid down the golden rule of all good manners, &ldquo;Whosoever
will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will
be chief among you, let him be your servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, I beg you to remember that all, or almost all, good manners
which we have among us&mdash;courtesies, refinements, self-restraint,
and mutual respect&mdash;all which raises us, socially and morally,
above our forefathers of fifteen hundred years ago&mdash;deep-hearted
men, valiant and noble, but coarse, and arrogant, and quarrelsome&mdash;all
that, or almost all, we owe to Christ, to the influence of His example,
and to that Bible which testifies of Him.&nbsp; Yes, the Bible has been
for Christendom, in the cottage as much as in the palace, the school
of manners; and the saying that he who becomes a true Christian becomes
a true gentleman, is no rhetorical boast, but a solid historic fact.</p>
<p>Now imagine Christ to reappear on earth, with that perfect outward
beauty of character&mdash;with what Greeks and Romans, and our own ancestors,
would have called those perfect manners&mdash;which, if we are to believe
the Gospels, He shewed in Judea of old, which won then so many hearts,
especially of the common people, sounder judges often of true nobility
than many who fancy themselves their betters.&nbsp; Conceive&mdash;but
which of us can conceive?&mdash;His perfect tenderness, patience, sympathy,
graciousness, and grace, combined with perfect strength, stateliness,
even awfulness, when awe was needed.&nbsp; Remember that, if, again,
the Gospels are to be believed.&nbsp; He alone, of all personages of
whom history tells us, solved in His own words and deeds the most difficult
paradox of human character&mdash;to be at once utterly conscious, and
yet utterly unconscious, of self; to combine with perfect self-sacrifice
a perfect self-assertion.&nbsp; Whether or not His being able to do
that proved Him to have been that which He was, the Son of God, it proves
Him at least to have been the Son of Man&mdash;the unique and unapproachable
ideal of humanity, utterly inspired by the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
<p>But again: He condescended, in His teaching of old, to the level
of Jewish, knowledge at that time.&nbsp; We may, therefore, believe
that He would condescend to the level of our modern knowledge; and what
would that involve?&nbsp; It would leave Him, however less than Himself,
at least master of all that the human race has thought or discovered
in the last eighteen hundred years.&nbsp; Think of that.&nbsp; And think
again, that if He condescended, as in Judea of old, to employ that knowledge
in teaching men&mdash;He who knew what was in man, and needed not that
any should bear witness to Him of man&mdash;He would manifest a knowledge
of human nature to which that of a Shakspeare would be purblind and
dull; a knowledge of which the Scripture nobly says that &ldquo;The
Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword,
even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and
marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart;&rdquo;
so that all &ldquo;things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him
with whom we have to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; And consider that, in the light
of that knowledge, He might adapt himself as perfectly to us of this
great city, as He did to the villagers of Galilee, or to the townsmen
of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Consider, again, that He who spoke as never man yet spake in Jerusalem,
might speak as man never yet spoke on English soil; that He who was
listened to gladly once, because He spake with authority, and not as
the scribes, at second hand, and by rule and precedent, might be listened
to gladly here once more.&nbsp; For He might speak here, not as we poor
scribes can speak at best, but with an authority, originality, earnestness,
as well as an eloquence, which might exercise a fascination, which would
be, to all with whom He came in contact, what Malachi calls it, &ldquo;a
refiner&rsquo;s fire&rdquo;&mdash;most purifying, though often most
painful to the very best; a fascination which might be to every one
who came under its spell a veritable Judgment and Day of the Lord, shewing
each man with fearful clearness to which side he really inclined at
heart in the struggle between truth and falsehood, good and evil; a
fascination, therefore, equally attractive to those who wished to do
right, and intolerable to those who wished to do wrong.</p>
<p>Consider that last thought.&nbsp; And consider, too, that those to
whom the fascination of such a personage might be so intolerable, that
it might turn to utter hate, would probably be those whose moral sense
was so perverted, that they thought they were doing right when they
were doing wrong, and speaking truth when they were telling lies.&nbsp;
It is an awful thought.&nbsp; But we know that there were such men,
and too many, among the scribes and Pharisees of Jerusalem.&nbsp; And
human nature is the same in every age.&nbsp; Be that as it may&mdash;however
retired His life, He could not long be hid.&nbsp; He would shortly exercise,
almost without attempting it, an enormous public influence.</p>
<p>But yet, as in Judea of old, would He not be only too successful?&nbsp;
Would He not be at once too liberal for some, and too exacting for others?&nbsp;
Would He not, as in Judea of old, encounter not merely the active envy
of the vain and the ambitious, which would follow one who spoke as never
man spoke; not merely the active malignity of those who wish their fellow-creatures
to be bad and not good; not merely the bigotry of every sect and party;
but that mere restless love of new excitements, and that dull fear and
suspicion of new truths, and even of old truths in new words, which
beset the uneducated of every rank and class, and in no age more than
in our own?&nbsp; And therefore I must ask, in sober sadness, how long
would His influence last?&nbsp; It lasted, we know, in Judea of old,
for some three years.&nbsp; And then&mdash;.&nbsp; But I am not going
to say that any such tragedy is possible now.&nbsp; It would be an insult
to Him; an insult to the gracious influences of His Spirit, the gracious
teaching of His Church, to say that of our generation, however unworthy
we may be of our high calling in Christ.&nbsp; And yet, if He had appeared
in any country of Christendom only four hundred years ago, might He
not have endured an even more dreadful death than that of the cross?</p>
<p>But doubtless, no personal harm would happen to Him here.&nbsp; Only
there might come a day, in which, as in Judea of old, &ldquo;after He
had said these things, many were offended, and walked no more with Him:&rdquo;
when his hearers and admirers would grow fewer and more few, some through
bigotry, some through envy, some through fickleness, some through cowardice,
till He was left alone with a little knot of earnest disciples; who
might diminish, alas, but too rapidly, when they found at He, as in
Judea of old, did not intend to become the head of a new sect, and to
gratify their ambition and vanity by making them His delegates.&nbsp;
And so the world, the religious world as well as the rest, might let
Him go His way, and vanish from the eyes and minds of men, leaving behind
little more than a regret that one so gifted and so fascinating should
have proved&mdash;I hardly like to say the words, and yet they must
be said&mdash;so unsafe and so unsound a teacher.</p>
<p>I shall not give now the reasons which have led me, and not in haste,
to this melancholy conclusion.&nbsp; I shall only say that I have come
to it, with pain, and shame, and fear.&nbsp; With shame and fear.&nbsp;
For when I ask you the solemn question, Would you know Christ if He
came among you? do I not ask myself a question which I dare not answer?&nbsp;
How can I tell whether I should recognise, after all, my Saviour and
my Lord?&nbsp; How do I know that if He said (as He but too certainly
might), something which clashed seriously with my preconceived notions
of what He ought to say, I should not be offended, and walk no more
with Him?&nbsp; How do I know that if He said, as in Judea of old, &ldquo;Will
ye too go away?&rdquo; I should answer with St Peter, &ldquo;Lord, to
whom shall we go?&nbsp; Thou hast the words of eternal life, and we
believe and are sure that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God?&rdquo;&nbsp; I dare not ask that question of myself.&nbsp; How
then dare I ask it of you?&nbsp; I know not.&nbsp; I can only say, &ldquo;Lord,
I believe: help thou mine unbelief.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know not.&nbsp; But
this I know&mdash;that in this or any other world, if you or I did recognise
Him, it would be with utter shame and terror, unless we had studied
and had striven to copy either Himself, or whatsoever seems to us most
like Him.&nbsp; Yes; to study the good, the beautiful, and the true
in Him, and wheresoever else we find it&mdash;for all that is good,
beautiful, and true throughout the universe are nought but rays from
Him, the central sun&mdash;to obey St. Paul of old, and &ldquo;whatsoever
things are true, venerable, just, pure, lovely, and of good report&mdash;if
there be any virtue and if there be any praise, to think on these things,&rdquo;&mdash;on
these scattered fragmentary sacraments of Him whose number is not two,
nor seven, &ldquo;but seventy-times seven;&rdquo; that is the way&mdash;I
think, the only way&mdash;to be ready to recognise our Saviour, and
to prepare to meet our God; that He may be to us, too, as a refiner&rsquo;s
fire, and refine us&mdash;our thoughts, our deeds, our characters throughout.</p>
<p>And I think, too, that this is the way, perhaps the only way, to
rid ourselves of the fancy that we can be accounted righteous before
God for any works or deservings of our own.&nbsp; Those in whom that
fancy lingers must have but a paltry standard of what righteousness
is, a mean conception of moral&mdash;that is, spiritual&mdash;perfection.&nbsp;
But those who look not inwards, but upwards; not at themselves, but
at Christ and all spiritual perfection&mdash;they become more and more
painfully aware of their own imperfections.&nbsp; The beauty of Christ&rsquo;s
character shows them the ugliness of their own.&nbsp; His purity shows
them their own foulness.&nbsp; His love their own hardness.&nbsp; His
wisdom their own folly.&nbsp; His strength their own weakness.&nbsp;
The higher their standard rises, the lower falls their estimate of themselves;
till, in utter humiliation and self-distrust, they seek comfort ere
alone it can be found&mdash;in <i>faith</i>&mdash;in utter faith and
trust in that very moral perfection of Christ which shames and dazzles
them, and yet is their only hope.&nbsp; To trust in Him for themselves
and all they love.&nbsp; To trust that, just because Christ is so magnificent,
He will pity, and not despise, our meanness.&nbsp; Just because He is
so pure, and righteous, and true, and lovely, He will appreciate, and
not abhor, our struggles after purity, righteousness, truth, love, however
imperfect, however soiled with failure&mdash;and with worse.&nbsp; Just
because He is so unlike us, He will smile graciously upon out feeblest
attempts to be like Him.&nbsp; Just because He has borne the sins and
carried the sorrows of mankind, therefore those who come to Him He will
in no wise cast out.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON V.&nbsp; ADVENT LESSONS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Westminster Abbey, First Sunday in Advent</i>, 1873.</p>
<p>Romans vii. 22-25.&nbsp; &ldquo;I delight in the law of God after
the inward man: but I see another law in my members, warring against
the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin
which is in my members.&nbsp; O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver
me from the body of this death?&nbsp; I thank God through Jesus Christ
our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the first Sunday in Advent.&nbsp; To-day we have prayed that
God would give us grace to put away the works of darkness, and put on
us the armour of light.&nbsp; Next Sunday we shall pray that, by true
understanding of the Scriptures, we may embrace and hold fast the blessed
hope of everlasting life.&nbsp; The Sunday after that the ministers
and stewards of God&rsquo;s mysteries may prepare His way by turning
the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just&mdash;the next,
that His grace and mercy may speedily help and deliver us from the sins
which hinder us in running the race set before us.&nbsp; But I do not
think that we shall understand those collects, or indeed the meaning
of Advent itself, or the reason why we keep the season of Advent year
by year, unless we first understand the prayer which we offered up last
Sunday, &ldquo;Stir up, O Lord, the wills of Thy faithful people,&rdquo;&mdash;and
we shall understand that prayer just in proportion as we have in us
the Spirit of God, or the spirit of the world, which is the spirit of
unbelief.</p>
<p>Worldly people say&mdash;and say openly, just now&mdash;that this
prayer is all a dream.&nbsp; They say God will not stir up men&rsquo;s
wills to do good any more than to do harm.&nbsp; He leaves men to themselves
to get through life as they can.&nbsp; This Heavenly Father of whom
you speak will not give His holy spirit to those who ask Him.&nbsp;
He does not, as one of your Collects says, put into men&rsquo;s minds
good desires&mdash;they come to a man entirely from outside a man, from
his early teaching, his youthful impressions, as they are called now-a-days.&nbsp;
He does not either give men grace and power to put these desires into
practice.&nbsp; That depends entirely on the natural strength of a man&rsquo;s
character; and that, again, depends principally on the state of his
brain.&nbsp; So, says the world, if you wish your own character to improve,
you must improve it yourself, for God will not improve it for you.&nbsp;
But, after all, why should you try to improve? why not be content to
be just what you are? you did not make yourself, and you are not responsible
for being merely what God has chosen to make you.</p>
<p>This is what worldly men say, or at least what they believe and act
on; and this is the reason why there is so little improvement in the
world, because men do not ask God to improve their hearts and stir up
their wills.&nbsp; I say, very little improvement.&nbsp; Men talk loudly
of the enlightenment of the age, and the progress of the species, and
the spread of civilisation, and so forth: but when I read old books,
and compare old times with these, I confess I do not see so much of
it as all this hopeful talk would lead me to expect.&nbsp; Men in general
have grown more prudent, more cunning, from long experience.&nbsp; They
have found out that certain sins do not pay&mdash;that is, they interfere
with people&rsquo;s comfort and their power of making money, and therefore
they prudently avoid them themselves, and put them down by law in other
men&rsquo;s cases.&nbsp; Men have certainly grown more good-natured,
in some countries, in that they dislike more than their ancestors did,
to inflict bodily torture on human beings; but they are just as ready,
or even more ready, to inflict on those whom they dislike that moral
and mental torture which to noble souls is worse than any bodily pain.&nbsp;
As for any real improvement in human nature&mdash;where is it?&nbsp;
There is just as much falsehood, cheating, and covetousness, I believe,
in the world as ever there was; just as much cant and hypocrisy, and
perhaps more; just as much envy, hatred, malice and all uncharitableness.&nbsp;
Is not the condition of the masses in many great cities as degraded
and as sad as ever was that of the serfs in the middle ages?&nbsp; Do
not the poor still die by tens of thousands of fevers, choleras, and
other diseases, which we know perfectly how to prevent, and yet have
not the will to prevent?&nbsp; Is not the adulteration of food just
now as scandalous as it is unchecked?&nbsp; The sins and follies of
human nature have been repressed in one direction only to break out
another.&nbsp; And as for open and coarse sin, people complain even
now, and I fear with justice, that there is more drunkenness in England
at this moment than there ever was.&nbsp; So much for our boasted improvement.</p>
<p>Look again at the wars of the world.&nbsp; Five-and-twenty years
ago, one used to be told that the human race was grown too wise to go
to war any more, and that we were to have an advent of universal peace
and plenty, and since then we have seen some seven great wars, the last
the most terrible of all,&mdash;and ever since, all the nations of Europe
have been watching each other in distrust and dread, increasing their
armaments, working often night and day at forging improved engines of
destruction, wherewith to kill their fellow-men.&nbsp; Not that I blame
that.&nbsp; It is necessary.&nbsp; Yes! but the hideous thing is, that
it should be necessary.&nbsp; Does that state of things look much like
progress of the human race?&nbsp; Can we say that mankind is much improved,
either in wisdom or in love, while all the nations of Europe are spending
millions merely to be ready to fight they know not whom, they know not
why?</p>
<p>No, my good friends, obey the wise man, and clear your minds of cant&mdash;man&rsquo;s
pretensions, man&rsquo;s boastfulness, man&rsquo;s power of blinding
his own eyes to plain facts&mdash;above all, to the plain fact that
he does not succeed, even in this world of which he fancies himself
the master, because he lives without God in the world.&nbsp; All this
saddens, I had almost said, sickens, a thoughtful man, till he turns
away from this noisy sham improvement of mankind&mdash;the wages of
sin, which are death, to St John&rsquo;s account of the true improvement
of mankind, the true progress of the species,&mdash;the gift of God
which is eternal life.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I saw a new heaven and a new
earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.&nbsp;
And I saw the Holy City&mdash;New Jerusalem, coming down from God out
of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&nbsp; And I
heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold the tabernacle of
God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His
people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God.&nbsp;
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be
no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any
more pain: for the former things are passed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does that sound much like a general increase of armaments? or like
bills for the prevention of pestilence, or of drunkenness,&mdash;which,
even if they pass, will both probably fail to do the good which they
propose?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; And if this wicked world is to be mended, then
God must stir up the wills of His faithful people, and we must pray
without ceasing for ourselves, and for all for whom we are bound to
pray, that He would stir them up.&nbsp; For what we want is not knowledge;
we have enough of that, and too much.&nbsp; Too much; for knowing so
much and doing so little, what an account will be required of us at
the last day!</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; It is the will which we want, in a hundred cases.&nbsp;
Take that of pestilential dwelling-houses in our great towns.&nbsp;
Every one knows that they ought to be made healthy; every one knows
that they can be made healthy.&nbsp; But the will to make them healthy
is not here, and they are left to breed disease and death.&nbsp; And
so, as in a hundred instances, shallow philosophers are proved, by facts,
to be mistaken, when they tell us that man will act up to the best of
his knowledge without God&rsquo;s help.&nbsp; For that is exactly what
man does not.&nbsp; What is wrong with the world in general, is wrong
likewise more or less with you and me, and with all human beings; for
after all, the world is made up of human beings; and the sin of the
world is nothing save the sins of each and all human beings put together;
and the world will be renewed and come right again, just as far and
no farther, as each human being is renewed and comes right.&nbsp; The
only sure method, therefore, of setting the world right, is to begin
by setting our own little part of the world right&mdash;in a word, setting
ourselves right.</p>
<p>But if we begin to try, that, we find, is just what we cannot do.&nbsp;
When a man begins to hunger and thirst after righteousness, and, discontented
with himself, attempts to improve himself, he soon begins to find a
painful truth in many a word of the Bible and the Prayer Book to which
he gave little heed, as long as he was contented with himself, and with
doing just what pleased him, right or wrong.&nbsp; He soon finds out
that he has no power of himself to help himself, that he is tied and
bound with the burden of his sins, and that he cannot, by reason of
his frailty, stand upright&mdash;that he actually is sore let and hindered
by his own sins, from running the race set before him, and doing his
duty where God has put him.&nbsp; All these sayings come home to him
as actual facts, most painful facts, but facts which he cannot deny.&nbsp;
He soon finds out the meaning and the truth of that terrible struggle
between the good in him and the evil in him, of which St Paul speaks
so bitterly in the text.&nbsp; How, when he tries to do good, evil is
present with him.&nbsp; How he delights in the law of God with his inward
mind, and yet finds another law in his body, warring against the law
of God, and bringing him into captivity to the law of sin.&nbsp; How
he is crippled by old bad habits, weakened by cowardice, by laziness,
by vanity, by general inability of will, till he is ready,&mdash;disgusted
at himself and his own weakness,&mdash;to cry, Who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?</p>
<p>Let him but utter that cry honestly.&nbsp; Let him once find out
that he wants something outside himself to help him, to deliver him,
to strengthen him, to stir up his weak will, to give him grace and power
to do what he knows instead of merely admiring it, and leaving it undone.&nbsp;
Let a man only find out that.&nbsp; Let him see that he needs a helper,
a deliverer, a strengthener&mdash;in one word, a Saviour&mdash;and he
will find one.&nbsp; I verily believe that, sooner or later, the Lord
Jesus Christ will reveal to that man what He revealed to St Paul; that
He Himself will deliver him; and that, like St Paul, after crying &ldquo;O
wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo;
he will be able to answer himself, I thank God&mdash;God will, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Christ will deliver me from the bonds of
my sins, Christ will stir up this weak will of mine, Christ will give
me strength and power, faithfully to fulfil all my good desires, because
He Himself has put them into my heart not to mock me, not to disappoint
me&mdash;not to make me wretched with the sight of noble graces and
virtues to which I cannot attain, but to fulfil His work in me.&nbsp;
What He has begun in me He will carry on in me.&nbsp; He has sown the
seed in me, and He will make it bear fruit, if only I pray to Him, day
by day, for strength to do what I know I ought to do, and cry morning
and night to Him, the fount of life, Stir up my will, O Lord, that I
may bring forth the fruit of good works, for then by Thee I shall be
plentifully rewarded.</p>
<p>So the man gains hope and heart for himself, and so, if he will but
think rationally and humbly, he may gain hope and heart for this poor
sinful world.&nbsp; For what has come true for him may come true for
any man.&nbsp; Who is he that God should care more for him than for
others?&nbsp; Who is he that God should help him when he prays, more
than He will help His whole church if it will but pray?&nbsp; He says
to himself, all this knowledge of what is right; all these good desires,
all these longings after a juster, purer, nobler, happier state of things;
there they are up and down the world already, though, alas! they have
borne little enough fruit as yet.&nbsp; Be it so.&nbsp; But God put
them into my heart.&nbsp; And who save God has put them into the world&rsquo;s
heart?&nbsp; It was God who sowed the seed in me; surely it is God who
has sowed it in other men?&nbsp; And if God has made it bear even the
poorest fruit in me, why should He not make it bear fruit in other men
and in all the world?&nbsp; All they need is that God should stir up
their wills, that they may do the good they know, and attain the blessedness
after which they long.</p>
<p>And then, if the man have a truly human, truly reasonable heart in
him&mdash;he feels that he can pray for others as well as for himself.&nbsp;
He feels that he must pray for them, and cry,&mdash;Thou alone canst
make men strong to do the right thing, and Thou wilt make them.&nbsp;
Stir up their wills, O Lord!&nbsp; Thou canst not mean that all the
good seed which is sown about the world should die and wither, and bring
no fruit to perfection.&nbsp; Surely Thy word will not return to Thee
void, but be like the rain which comes down from heaven, and gives seed
to the sower and bread to the eater.&nbsp; Oh, strengthen such as stand,
and comfort and help the weak-hearted, and raise up them that fall,
and, finally, beat down Satan and all the powers of evil under our feet,
and pour out thy spirit on all flesh, that so their Father&rsquo;s name
may be hallowed, His kingdom come, His will be done on earth as it is
in heaven.&nbsp; And so will come the one and only true progress of
the human race&mdash;which is, that all men should become faithful and
obedient citizens of the holy city, the kingdom of God, which is the
Church of Christ.&nbsp; To which may God in His mercy bring us all,
and our children after us.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p>This, then, is the lesson why we are met together this Advent day.&nbsp;
We are met to pray that God would so help us by His grace and mercy
that we may bring forth the fruit of good works, and that when our Lord
Jesus Christ shall come in His glorious majesty to judge the quick and
the dead, we, and our descendants after us, may be found an acceptable
people in His sight.</p>
<p>We are met to pray, in a National Church, for the whole nation of
England, that all orders and degrees therein may, each in his place
and station, help forward the hallowing of God&rsquo;s name, the coming
of His kingdom, the doing of His will on earth.&nbsp; We are met to
pray for the Queen and all that are in authority, that these Advent
collects may be fulfilled in them, and by them, for the good of the
whole people; for the ministers and stewards of Christ&rsquo;s mysteries,
that the same collects may be fulfilled by them and in them, till they
turn the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; for the
Commons of this nation, that each man may he delivered, by God&rsquo;s
grace and mercy, from the special sin which besets him in this faithless
and worldly generation and hinders him from running the race of duty
which is set before him, and get strength from God so to live that in
that dread day he may meet his Judge and King, not in tenor and in shame,
but in loyalty and in humble hope.</p>
<p>But more&mdash;we are here to worship God in Christ, both God and
man.&nbsp; To confess that without Him we can do nothing, that unless
He enlighten our understandings we are dark, unless He stir up our wills
we are powerless for good.&nbsp; To confess that though we have forgotten
Him, yet He has not forgotten us.&nbsp;  That He is the same gracious
and generous Giver and Saviour.&nbsp; That though we deny Him He cannot
deny Himself.&nbsp; That He is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever
as when He came to visit this earth in great humility.&nbsp; That the
Lord is King, though the earth be moved.&nbsp; He sitteth upon His throne,
be the nations never so unquiet.&nbsp; We are here to declare to ourselves
and all men, and the whole universe, that we at least believe that the
heavens and earth are full of His glory.&nbsp; We are here to declare
that, whether or not the kings of the earth are wise enough, or the
judges of it learned enough, to acknowledge Christ for their king, we
at least will worship the Son lest He be angry, and so we perish from
the right way; for if His wrath be kindled, yea but a little, then blessed
are they, and they only, who put their trust in Him.&nbsp; We are here
to join our songs with angels round the throne, and with those pure
and mighty beings who, in some central sanctuary of the universe, cry
for ever, &ldquo;Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour
and power: for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they
are and were created.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We do so in ancient words, ancient music, ancient ceremonies, for
a token that Christ&rsquo;s rule and glory is an ancient rule and an
eternal glory; that it is no new discovery of our own, and depends not
on our own passing notions and feelings about it, but is like Christ,
the same now as in the days of our forefathers, the same as it was fifteen
hundred years ago, the same as it has been since the day that He stooped
to be born of the Virgin Mary, the same that it will be till He shall
come in His glory to judge the quick and the dead.&nbsp; Therefore we
delight in the ancient ceremonial, as like as we can make it, to that
of the earlier and purer ages of the Church, when Christianity was still,
as it were, fresh from the hand of its Creator, ere yet it had been
debased and defiled by the idolatrous innovations of the Church of Rome.&nbsp;
For so we confess ourselves bound by links of gratitude to the Apostles,
and the successors of the Apostles, and to all which has been best,
purest, and truest in the ages since.&nbsp; So we confess that we worship
the same God-man of whom Apostles preached, of whom fathers philosophised,
and for whom martyrs died.&nbsp; That we believe, like them, that He
alone is King of kings and Lord of lords; that there is no progress,
civilization, or salvation in this life or the life to come, but through
His undeserved mercy and His strengthening grace; that He has reigned
from the creation of the world, reigns now, and will reign unto that
last dread day, when He shall have put all enemies under His feet, and
delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, that God may be all
in all.&nbsp; Unto which day may He in His mercy bring us all through
faith and good works: Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON VI.&nbsp; CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley.&nbsp; Quinquagesima Sunday</i>, 1872.</p>
<p>Genesis ix. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.&nbsp; &ldquo;And God blessed Noah and
his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
the earth. . . .&nbsp; Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat
for you . . .&nbsp; But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood
thereof, shall ye not eat.&nbsp; And surely your blood of your lives
will I require: at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at
the hand of man; at the hand of every man&rsquo;s brother will I require
the life of man.&nbsp; Whoso sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood, by man shall
his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is God&rsquo;s blessing on mankind.&nbsp; This is our charter
from God, who made and rules this earth.&nbsp; This is the end and duty
of our mortal life:&mdash;to be fruitful and multiply and replenish
the earth, and subdue it.&nbsp; But is that all?&nbsp; Is there no hint
in this blessing of God of something more than our mortal life&mdash;something
beyond our mortal life?&nbsp; Surely there is.&nbsp; Those words&mdash;&ldquo;in
the image of God made He man,&rdquo; must mean, if they mean anything,
that man can, if he will but be a true man, share the eternal life of
God.&nbsp; But I will not speak of that to-day, but rather of a question
about his mortal life in this world, which is this:&mdash;What is the
reason why man has a right over the lives of animals? why he may use
them for his food? and at the same time, what is the reason why he has
not the same right over the lives of his fellow-men? why he may not
use them for food?</p>
<p>It is this&mdash;that &ldquo;in the image of God made He man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Man is made in the image and likeness of God, therefore he is a sacred
creature; a creature, not merely an animal, and the highest of all animals,
only cunninger than all animals, more highly organised, more delicately
formed than all animals; but something beyond an animal.&nbsp; He is
in the likeness of God, therefore he is consecrated to God.&nbsp; He
is the one creature on earth whom God, so far as we know, is trying
to make like Himself.&nbsp; Therefore, whosoever kills a man, sins not
only against that man, nor against society: he sins against God.&nbsp;
And God will require that man&rsquo;s blood at the hand of him who slays
him.&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; At the hand of every beast will He require
it, and at the hand of every man.</p>
<p>What that first part of the law means I cannot tell.&nbsp; How God
will require from the lion, or the crocodile, or the shark, who eats
a human being, the blood of their victims, is more than I can say.&nbsp;
But this I can say&mdash;that the feeling, not only of horror and pity,
but of real rage and indignation, with which men see (what God grant
you never may see) a wild beast kill a man, is a witness in man&rsquo;s
conscience that the text is true somehow, though how we know not.&nbsp;
I received a letter a few weeks since from an officer, a very remarkable
person, in which he described his horror and indignation at seeing a
friend of his struck down and eaten by a tiger, and how, when next day
he stood over what had been but the day before a human being, he looked
up to heaven, and kept repeating the words of the text, &ldquo;in the
image of God made He man,&rdquo; in rage and shame, and almost accusing
God for allowing His image to be eaten by a brute beast.&nbsp; It shook,
for the moment, his faith in God&rsquo;s justice and goodness.&nbsp;
That man was young then, and has grown calmer and wiser now, and has
regained a deeper and sounder faith in God.&nbsp; But the shock, he
said, was dreadful to him.&nbsp; He felt that the matter was not merely
painful and pitiable, but that it was a wrong and a crime; and on the
faith of this very text, a wrong and a crime I believe it to be, and
one which God knows how to avenge and to correct when man cannot.&nbsp;
Somehow&mdash;for He has ways of which we poor mortals do not dream&mdash;at
the hand of every beast will He require the blood of man.</p>
<p>But more; at the hand of every man will He require it.&nbsp; And
how?&nbsp; The text tells us, &ldquo;Whoso sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood,
by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made He man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, I do not doubt but that the all-seeing God, looking back on what
had most probably happened on this earth already, and looking forward
to what would happen, and happens, alas! too often now, meant to warn
men against the awful crime of cannibalism, of eating their fellow-men
as they would eat an animal.&nbsp; By so doing, they not only treated
their fellow-men as beasts, but they behaved like beasts themselves.&nbsp;
They denied that their victim was made in the likeness of God; they
denied that they were made in the likeness of God; they willingly and
deliberately put on the likeness of beasts, and as beasts they were
to perish.&nbsp; Now, this is certain, that savages who eat men&mdash;and
alas! there are thousands even now who do so&mdash;usually know in their
hearts that they are doing wrong.&nbsp; As soon as their consciences
are the least awakened, they are ashamed of their cannibalism; they
lie about it, try to conceal it; and as soon as God&rsquo;s grace begins
to work on them, it is the very first sin that they give up.&nbsp; And
next, this is certain, that there is a curse upon it.&nbsp; No cannibal
people, so far as I can find, have ever risen or prospered in the world;
and the cannibal peoples now-a-days, and for the last three hundred
years, have been dying out.&nbsp; By their own vices, diseases, and
wars, they perish off the face of the earth, in the midst of comfort
and plenty; and, in spite of all the efforts of missionaries, even their
children and grand-children, after giving up the horrid crime, and becoming
Christians, seem to have no power of living and increasing, but dwindle
away, and perish off the earth.&nbsp; Yes, God&rsquo;s laws work in
strange and subtle ways; so darkly, so slowly, that the ungodly and
sinners often believe that there are no laws of God, and say&mdash;&ldquo;Tush,
how should God perceive it?&nbsp; Is there knowledge in the Most High?&rdquo;&nbsp;
But the laws work, nevertheless, whether men are aware of them or not.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The mills of God grind slowly,&rdquo; but sooner or later they
grind the sinner to powder.</p>
<p>And now I will leave this hateful subject and go on to another, on
which I am moved to speak once and for all, because it is much in men&rsquo;s
minds just now&mdash;I mean what is vulgarly called &ldquo;capital punishment,&rdquo;
the punishing of murder by death.&nbsp; Now the text, which is the ancient
covenant of God with man, speaks very clearly on this point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whosoever
sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Man is made in the likeness of God.&nbsp; That is the ground of our
law about murder, as it is the ground of all just and merciful law;
that gives man his right to slay the murderer; that makes it his duty
to slay the murderer.&nbsp; He has to be jealous of God&rsquo;s likeness,
and to slay, in the name of God, the man who, by murder, outrages the
likeness of God in himself and in his victim.</p>
<p>You all know that there is now-a-days a strong feeling among some
persons about capital punishment; that there are those who will move
heaven and earth to interfere with the course of justice, and beg off
the worst of murderers, on any grounds, however unreasonable, fanciful,
even unfair; simply because they have a dislike to human beings being
hanged.&nbsp; I believe, from long consideration, that these persons&rsquo;
strange dislike proceeds from their not believing sufficiently that
man is made in the image of God.&nbsp; And, alas! it proceeds, I fear,
in some of them, from not believing in a God at all&mdash;believing,
perhaps, in some mere maker of the world, but not in the living God
which Scripture sets forth.&nbsp; For how else can they say, as I have
known some say, that capital punishment is wrong, because &ldquo;we
have no right to usher a man into the presence of his Maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into the presence of his Maker!&nbsp; Why, where else is every man,
you and I, heathen and Christian, bad and good, save in the presence
of his Maker already?&nbsp; Do we not live and move and have our being
in God?&nbsp; Whither can we go from His spirit, or whither can we flee
from His presence?&nbsp; If we ascend into heaven, He is there.&nbsp;
If we go down to hell He is there also.&nbsp; And if the law puts a
man to death, it does not usher him into the presence of his Maker,
for he is there already.&nbsp; It simply says to him, &ldquo;God has
judged you on earth, not we.&nbsp; God will judge you in the next world,
not we.&nbsp; All we know is, that you are not fit to live in this world.&nbsp;
All our duty is to send you out of it.&nbsp; Where you will go in the
other world is God&rsquo;s matter, not ours, and the Lord have mercy
on your soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this want of faith in a living God lies at the bottom of another
objection.&nbsp; We are to keep murderers alive in order to convert
and instruct and amend them.&nbsp; The answer is, We shall be most happy
to amend anybody of any fault, however great: but the experience of
ages is that murderers are past mending; that the fact of a man&rsquo;s
murdering another is a plain proof that he has no moral sense, and has
become simply a brute animal Our duty is to punish not to amend, and
to say to the murderer, &ldquo;If you can be amended; God will amend
you, and so have mercy on your soul.&nbsp; God must amend you, if you
are to be amended.&nbsp; If God cannot amend you, we cannot.&nbsp; If
God will not amend you, certainly we cannot force Him to do so, if we
kept you alive for a thousand years.&rdquo;&nbsp; That would seem reasonable,
as well as reverent and faithful to God.&nbsp; But men now-a-days fancy
that they love their fellow creatures far better than God loves them,
and can deal far more wisely and lovingly with them than God is willing
to deal.&nbsp; Of these objections I take little heed.&nbsp; I look
on them as merely loose cant, which does not quite understand the meaning
of its own words, and I trust to sound, hard, English common sense to
put them aside.</p>
<p>But there is another objection to capital punishment, which we must
deal with much more respectfully and tenderly; for it is made by certain
good people, people whom we must honour, though we differ from them,
for no set of people have done more (according to their numbers) for
education, for active charity, and for benevolence, and for peace and
good will among the nations of the earth.&nbsp; And they say, you must
not take the life of a murderer, just because he is made in God&rsquo;s
image.&nbsp; Well, I should have thought that God Himself was the best
judge of that.&nbsp; That, if God truly said that man was made in His
image, and said, moreover, as it were at the same moment, that, therefore,
whoso sheds man&rsquo;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed&mdash;our
duty was to trust God, to obey God, and to do our duty against the murderer,
however painful to our feelings it might be.&nbsp; But I believe these
good people make their mistake from forgetting this; that if the murderer
be made in God&rsquo;s image and likeness, so is the man whom he murders;
and so also is the jury who convict him, the judge who condemns him,
and the nation (the society of men) for whom they act.</p>
<p>And this, my dear friends, brings us to the very root of the meaning
of law.&nbsp; Man has sense to make laws (which animals cannot do),
just because he is made in the likeness of God, and has the sense of
right and wrong.&nbsp; Man has the right to enforce laws, to see right
done and wrong punished, just because he is made in the likeness of
God.&nbsp; The laws of a country, as far as they are just and righteous,
are the copy of what the men of that country have found out about right
and wrong, and about how much right they can get done, and how much
wrong punished.&nbsp; So, just as the men of a country are (in spite
of all their sins) made in the likeness of God, so the laws of a country
(in spite of all their defects) are a copy of God&rsquo;s will, as to
what men should or should not do.&nbsp; And that, and no other, is the
true reason why the judge or magistrate has authority over either property,
liberty, or life.&nbsp; He is God&rsquo;s servant, the servant of Christ,
who is King of this land and of all lands, and of all governments, and
all kings and rulers of the earth.&nbsp; He sits there in God&rsquo;s
name, to see God&rsquo;s will done, as far as poor fallible human beings
can get it done.&nbsp; And, because he is, not merely as a man, but,
by his special authority, in the likeness of God, who has power over
life and death, therefore he also, as far as his authority goes, has
power over life and death.&nbsp; That is my opinion, and that was the
opinion of St. Paul.&nbsp; For what does he say&mdash;and say not (remember
always) of Christian magistrates in a Christian country, but actually
of heathen Roman magistrates?&nbsp; &ldquo;Let every soul be subject
unto the higher powers.&nbsp; For there is no power but of God: the
powers that be are ordained of God.&nbsp; Whosoever therefore resisteth
the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall
receive to themselves damnation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus spoke out the tenderest-hearted,
most Christ-like human being, perhaps, who ever trod this earth, who,
in his intense longing to save sinners, endured a life of misery and
danger, and finished it by martyrdom.&nbsp; But there was no sentimentality,
no soft indulgence in him.&nbsp; He knew right from wrong; common sense
from cant; duty from public opinion; and divine charity from the mere
cowardly dislike of witnessing pain, not so much because it pains the
person punished, as because it pains the spectator.&nbsp; He knew that
Christ was King of kings, and what Christ&rsquo;s kingdom was like.&nbsp;
He had discovered the divine and wonderful order of men and angels.&nbsp;
He saw that one part of that order was&mdash;&ldquo;the soul that sinneth,
it shall die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But some say that capital punishment is inconsistent with the mild
religion of Christ&mdash;the religion of mercy and love.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
mild religion of Christ!&rdquo;&nbsp; Do these men know of Whom they
talk?&nbsp; Do they know that, if the Bible be true, the God who said,
&ldquo;Whoso sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed,&rdquo;
is the very same Being, the very same God, who was born of the Virgin
Mary, crucified under Pontius Pilate&mdash;the very same Christ who
took little children up in His arms and blessed them, the very same
Word of God, too, of whom it is written, that out of His mouth goeth
a two-edged sword, that He may smite the nations, and He shall rule
them with a rod of iron, and He treadeth the wine press of the fierceness
and wrath of Almighty God?&nbsp; These are awful words, but, my dear
friends, I can only ask you if you think them too awful to be true?&nbsp;
Do you believe the Christian religion?&nbsp; Do you believe the Creeds?&nbsp;
Do you believe the Bible?&nbsp; For if you do, then you believe that
the Lord Christ, who was born of the Virgin Mary, and crucified under
Pontius Pilate, is the Maker, the Master, the Ruler of this world, and
of all worlds.&nbsp; By what laws He rules other worlds we know not,
save that they are, because they must be&mdash;just and merciful laws.&nbsp;
But of the laws by which He rules this world we do know, by experience,
that His laws are of most terrible and unbending severity, as I have
warned you again and again, and shall warn you, as long as there is
a liar or an idler, a drunkard or an adulteress in this parish.</p>
<p>And if this be so&mdash;if Christ be a God of severity as well as
a God of love, a God who punishes sinners as well as a God who forgives
penitents&mdash;what then?&nbsp; We are, He tells us, made in His likeness.&nbsp;
Then, according to His likeness we must behave.&nbsp; We must copy His
love, by helping the poor and afflicted, the weak and the oppressed.&nbsp;
But we must copy His severity, by punishing whenever we have the power,
without cowardice or indulgence, all wilful offenders; and, above all,
the man who destroys God&rsquo;s image in himself, by murdering and
destroying the mortal life of a man made in the image of God.&nbsp;
And more; if we be made in the likeness of God and of Christ, we must
remember, morning and night, and all day long, that most awful and most
blessed fact.&nbsp; We must say to ourselves, again and again, &ldquo;I
am not a mere animal, and like a mere animal I must not behave; I dare
not behave like a mere animal, for I was made in the likeness of God;
and when I was baptised the Spirit of God took possession of me to restore
me to God&rsquo;s likeness, and to call out and perfect God&rsquo;s
likeness in me all my life long.&nbsp; Therefore, I am no mere animal;
and never was intended to be.&nbsp; I am the temple of God; my body
and soul belong to God, and not to my own fancies and passions and lusts,
and whosoever defiles the temple of God, him will God destroy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore, this is our duty, this is our only hope or safety&mdash;to
do our best to keep alive and strong the likeness of God in ourselves;
to try to grow, not more and more mean, and brutal, and carnal, but
more and more noble, and human, and spiritual; to crush down our base
passions, our selfish inclinations, by the help of the Spirit of God,
and to think of and to pray for, whatsoever is like Christ and like
God; to pray for a noble love of what is good and noble, for a noble
hate of what is bad; and whatsoever things are pure and lovely and of
good report to think of these things.&nbsp; And to pray, too, for forgiveness
from Christ, and for the sake of Christ, whenever we have yielded to
our low passions, and defiled the likeness of God in us, and grieved
His Spirit, lest at the last day it be said to us, if not in words yet
in acts, which there will be no mistaking, no escaping,&mdash;&ldquo;I
made thee in My likeness in the beginning of the creation, I redeemed
thee into My likeness on the cross, I baptised thee into My likeness
by my Holy Spirit; and what hast thou hast done with My likeness?&nbsp;
Thou hast cast it away, thou hast let it die out in thee, thou hast
lived after the flesh and not after the spirit, and hast put on the
likeness of the carnal man, the likeness of the brute.&nbsp; Thou hast
copied the vanity of the peacock, the silliness of the ape, the cunning
of the fox, the rapacity of the tiger, the sensuality of the swine;
but thou hast not copied God, thy God, who died that thou mightest live,
and be a man.&nbsp; Then, thou hast destroyed God&rsquo;s likeness,
for thou hast destroyed it in thyself.&nbsp; Thou hast slain a man,
for thou hast slain thy own manhood, and art thine own murderer, and
thine own blood shall be required at thy hand.&nbsp; That which thou
hast done to God&rsquo;s likeness in thee, shall be done to that which
remains of thee in a second death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And from that may Christ in His mercy deliver us all.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON VII.&nbsp; TEMPTATION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, 1872.&nbsp; <i>Chester Cathedral</i>, 1872.</p>
<p>St Matt. iv. 3.&nbsp; &ldquo;And when the tempter came to Him, he
said, If Thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let me say a few words to-day about a solemn subject, namely, Temptation.&nbsp;
I do not mean the temptations of the flesh&mdash;the temptations which
all men have to yield to the low animal nature in them, and behave like
brutes.&nbsp; I mean those deeper and more terrible temptations, which
our Lord conquered in that great struggle with evil which is commonly
called His temptation in the wilderness.&nbsp; These were temptations
of an evil spirit&mdash;the temptations which entice some men, at least,
to behave like devils.</p>
<p>Now these temptations specially beset religious men&mdash;men who
are, or fancy themselves, superior to their fellow-men, more favoured
by God, and with nobler powers, and grander work to do, than the common
average of mankind.&nbsp; But specially, I say, they beset those who
are, or fancy themselves, the children of God.&nbsp; And, therefore,
I humbly suppose our Lord had to endure and to conquer these very temptations
because He was not merely a child of God, but the Son of God&mdash;the
perfect Man, made in the perfect likeness of His Father.&nbsp; He had
to endure these temptations, and to conquer them, that He might be able
to succour us when we are tempted, seeing that He was tempted in like
manner as we are, yet without sin.</p>
<p>Now it has been said, and, I think, well said, that what proves our
Lord&rsquo;s three temptations to have been very subtle and dangerous
and terrible, is this&mdash;that we cannot see at first sight that they
were temptations at all.&nbsp; The first two do not look to us to be
wrong.&nbsp; If our Lord could make stones into bread to satisfy His
hunger, why should He not do so?&nbsp; If He could prove to the Jews
that He was the Son of God, their divine King and Saviour, by casting
Himself down from the pinnacle of the temple, and being miraculously
supported in the air by angels&mdash;if He could do that, why should
He not do it?&nbsp; And lastly, the third temptation looks at first
sight so preposterous that it seems silly of the evil spirit to have
hinted at it.&nbsp; To ask any man of piety, much less the Son of God
Himself, to fall down and worship the devil, seems perfectly absurd&mdash;a
request not to be listened to for a moment, but put aside with contempt.</p>
<p>Well, my friends, and the very danger of these spiritual temptations
is&mdash;that they do not look like temptations.&nbsp; They do not look
ugly, absurd, wrong, they look pleasant, reasonable, right.</p>
<p>The devil, says the apostle, transforms himself at times into an
angel of light.&nbsp; If so, then he is certainly far more dangerous
than if he came as an angel of darkness and horror.&nbsp; If you met
some venomous snake, with loathsome spots upon his scales, his eyes
full of rage and cunning, his head raised to strike at you, hissing
and showing his fangs, there would be no temptation to have to do with
him.&nbsp; You would know that you had to deal with an evil beast, and
must either kill him or escape from him at once.&nbsp; But if, again,
you met, as you may meet in the tropics, a lovely little coral snake,
braided with red and white, its mouth so small that it seems impossible
that it can bite, and so gentle that children may take it up and play
with it, then you might be tempted, as many a poor child has been ere
now, to admire it, fondle it, wreathe it round the neck for a necklace,
or round the arm for a bracelet, till the play goes one step too far,
the snake loses its temper, gives one tiny scratch upon the lip or finger,
and that scratch is certain death.&nbsp; That would be a temptation
indeed; one all the more dangerous because there is, I am told, another
sort of coral snake perfectly harmless, which is so exactly like the
deadly one, that no child, and few grown people, can know them apart.</p>
<p>Even so it is with our worst temptations.&nbsp; They look sometimes
so exactly like what is good and noble and useful and religious, that
we mistake the evil for the good, and play with it till it stings us,
and we find out too late that the wages of sin are death.&nbsp; Thus
religious people, just because they are religious, are apt to be specially
tempted to mistake evil for good, to do something specially wrong, when
they think they are doing something specially right, and so give occasion
to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme; till, as a hard and experienced
man of the world once said: &ldquo;Whenever I hear a man talking of
his conscience, I know that he is going to do something particularly
foolish; whenever I hear of a man talking of his duty, I know that he
is going to do something particularly cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do I say this to frighten you away from being religious?&nbsp; God
forbid.&nbsp; Better to be religious and to fear and love God, though
you were tempted by all the devils out of the pit, than to be irreligious
and a mere animal, and be tempted only by your own carnal nature, as
the animals are.&nbsp; Better to be tempted, like the hermits of old,
and even to fall and rise again, singing, &ldquo;Rejoice not against
me, O mine enemy, when I fall I shall arise;&rdquo; than to live the
life of the flesh, &ldquo;like a beast with lower pleasures, like a
beast with lower pains.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the price a man must pay
for hungering and thirsting after righteousness, for longing to be a
child of God in spirit and in truth.&nbsp; &ldquo;The devil,&rdquo;
says a wise man of old, &ldquo;does not tempt bad men, because he has
got them already; he tempts good men, because he has <i>not</i> got
them, and wants to get them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how shall we know these temptations?&nbsp; God knows, my friends,
better than I; and I trust that He will teach you to know, according
to what each of you needs to know.&nbsp; But as far as my small experience
goes, the root of them all is pride and self-conceit.&nbsp; Whatsoever
thoughts or feelings tempt us to pride and self-conceit are of the devil,
not of God.&nbsp; The devil is specially the spirit of pride; and, therefore,
whatever tempts you to fancy yourself something different from your
fellow-men, superior to your fellow men, safer than them, more favoured
by God than them, that is a temptation of the spirit of pride.&nbsp;
Whatever tempts you to think that you can do without God&rsquo;s help
and God&rsquo;s providence; whatever tempts you to do anything extraordinary,
and show yourself off, that you may make a figure in the world; and
above all, whatever tempts you to antinomianism, that is, to fancy that
God will overlook sins in you which He will not overlook in other men&mdash;all
these are temptations from the spirit of pride.&nbsp; They are temptations
like our Lord&rsquo;s temptations.&nbsp; These temptations came on our
Lord more terribly than they ever can on you and me, just because He
was the Son of Man, the perfect Man, and, therefore, had more real reason
for being proud (if such a thing could be) than any man, or than all
men put together.&nbsp; But He conquered the temptations because He
was perfect Man, led by the Spirit of God; and, therefore, He knew that
the only way to be a perfect man was not to be proud, however powerful,
wise, and glorious He might be; but to submit Himself humbly and utterly,
as every man should do, to the will of His Father in Heaven, from whom
alone His greatness came.</p>
<p>Now the spirit of pride cannot understand the beauty of humility,
and the spirit of self-will cannot understand the beauty of obedience;
and, therefore, it is reasonable to suppose the devil could not understand
our Lord.&nbsp; If He be the Son of God, so might Satan argue, He has
all the more reason to be proud; and, therefore, it is all the more
easy to tempt Him into shewing His pride, into proving Himself a conceited,
self-willed, rebellious being&mdash;in one word, an evil spirit.</p>
<p>And therefore (as you will see at first sight) the first two temptations
were clearly meant to tempt our Lord to pride; for would they not tempt
you and me to pride?&nbsp; If we could feed ourselves by making bread
of stones, would not that make us proud enough?&nbsp; So proud, I fear,
that we should soon fancy that we could do without God and His providence,
and were masters of nature and all her secrets.&nbsp; If you and I could
make the whole city worship and obey us, by casting ourselves off this
cathedral unhurt, would not that make us proud enough?&nbsp; So proud,
I fear, that we should end in committing some great folly, or great
crime in our conceit and vainglory.</p>
<p>Now, whether our Lord could or could not have done these wonderful
deeds, one thing is plain&mdash;that He would not do them; and, therefore,
we may presume that He ought not to have done them.&nbsp; It seems as
if He did not wish to be a wonderful man: but only a perfectly good
man, and He would do nothing to help Himself but what any other man
could do.&nbsp; He answered the evil spirit simply out of Scripture,
as any other pious man might have done.&nbsp; When He was bidden to
make the stones into bread, He answers not as the Eternal Son of God,
but simply as a man.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is written:&rdquo;&mdash;it is
the belief of Moses and the old prophets of my people that man doth
not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
mouth of God:&mdash;as much as to say, If I am to be delivered out of
this need, God will deliver me by some means or other, just as He delivers
other men out of their needs.&nbsp; When He was bidden cast Himself
from the temple, and so save Himself, probably from sorrow, poverty,
persecution, and the death on the cross, He answers out of Scripture
as any other Jew would have done.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is written again,
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says nothing&mdash;this
is most important&mdash;of His being the eternal Son of God.&nbsp; He
keeps that in the background.&nbsp; There the fact was; but He veiled
the glory of His godhead, that He might assert the rights of His manhood,
and shew that mere man, by the help of the Spirit of God, could obey
God, and keep His commandments.</p>
<p>I say these last words with all diffidence and humility, and trusting
that the Lord will pardon any mistake which I may make about His Divine
Words.&nbsp; I only say them because wiser men than I have often taken
the same view already.&nbsp; Of course there is more, far more, in this
wonderful saying than we can understand, or ever will understand.&nbsp;
But this I think is plain&mdash;that our Lord determined to behave as
any and every other man ought to have done in His place; in order to
shew all God&rsquo;s children the example of perfect humility and perfect
obedience to God.</p>
<p>But again, the devil asked our Lord to fall down and worship him.&nbsp;
Now how could that be a temptation to pride?&nbsp; Surely that was asking
our Lord to do anything but a proud action, rather the most humiliating
and most base of all actions.&nbsp; My friends, it seems to me that
if our Lord had fallen down and worshipped the evil spirit, He would
have given way to the spirit of pride utterly and boundlessly; and I
will tell you why.</p>
<p>The devil wanted our Lord to do evil that good might come.&nbsp;
It would have been a blessing, that all the kingdoms of the world and
the glory of man should be our Lord&rsquo;s,&mdash;the very blessing
for this poor earth which He came to buy, and which He bought with His
own precious blood.&nbsp; And here the devil offered Him the very prize
for which He came down on earth, without struggle or difficulty, if
He would but do, for one moment, one wrong thing.&nbsp; What temptation
that would be to our Lord as God, I dare not say.&nbsp; But that to
our Lord as Man, it must have been the most terrible of all temptations,
I can well believe: because history shews us, and, alas! our own experience
in modern times shews us, persons yielding to that temptation perpetually;
pious people, benevolent people, people who long to spread the Bible,
to convert sinners, to found charities, to amend laws, to set the world
right in some way or other, and who fancy that therefore, in carrying
out their fine projects, they have a right to do evil that good may
come.</p>
<p>This is a very painful subject; all the more painful just now, because
I sometimes think it is the special sin of this country and this generation,
and that God will bring on us some heavy punishment for it.&nbsp; But
all who know the world in its various phases, and especially what are
called the religious world, and the philanthropic world, and the political
world, know too well that men, not otherwise bad men, will do things
and say things, to carry out some favourite project or movement, or
to support some party, religious or other, which they would (I hope)
be ashamed to say and do for their own private gain.&nbsp; Now what
is this, but worshipping the evil spirit, in order to get power over
this world, that they may (as they fancy) amend it?&nbsp; And what is
this but self-conceit&mdash;ruinous, I had almost said, blasphemous?&nbsp;
These people think themselves so certainly in the right, and their plans
so absolutely necessary to the good of the world, that God has given
them a special licence to do what they like in carrying them out; that
He will excuse in them falsehoods and meannesses, even tyranny and violences
which He will excuse in no one else.</p>
<p>Now, is not this self-conceit?&nbsp; What would you think of a servant
who disobeyed you, cheated you, and yet said to himself&mdash;No matter,
my master dare not turn me off: I am so useful that he cannot do without
me.&nbsp; Even so in all ages, and now as much as, or more than ever,
have men said, We are so necessary to God and God&rsquo;s cause, that
He cannot do without us; and therefore though He hates sin in everyone
else, He will excuse sin in us, as long as we are about His business.</p>
<p>Therefore, my dear friends, whenever we are tempted to do or say
anything rash, or vain, or mean, because we are the children of God;
whenever we are inclined to be puffed up with spiritual pride, and to
fancy that we may take liberties which other men must not take, because
we are the children of God; let us remember the words of the text, and
answer the tempter, when he says, If thou be the Son of God, do this
and that, as our Lord answered him&mdash;&ldquo;If I be the Child of
God, what then?&nbsp; This&mdash;that I must behave as if God were my
Father.&nbsp; I must trust my God utterly, and I must obey Him utterly.&nbsp;
I must do no rash or vain thing to tempt God, even though it looks as
if I should have a great success, and do much good thereby.&nbsp; I
must do no mean or base thing, nor give way for a moment to the wicked
ways of this wicked world, even though again it looks as if I should
have a great success, and do much good thereby.&nbsp; In one word, I
must worship my Father in heaven, and Him only must I serve.&nbsp; If
He wants me, He will use me.&nbsp; If He does not want me, He will use
some one else.&nbsp; Who am I, that God cannot govern the world without
my help?&nbsp; My business is to refrain my soul, and keep it low, even
as a weaned child, and not to meddle with matters too high for me.&nbsp;
My business is to do the little, simple, everyday duties which lie nearest
me, and be faithful in a few things; and then, if Christ will, He may
make me some day ruler over many things, and I shall enter into the
joy of my Lord, which is the joy of doing good to my fellow men.&nbsp;
But I shall never enter into that by thrusting myself into Christ&rsquo;s
way, with grand schemes and hasty projects, as if I knew better than
He how to make His kingdom come.&nbsp; If I do, my pride will have a
fall.&nbsp; Because I would not be faithful over a few things, I shall
be tempted to be unfaithful over many things; and instead of entering
into the joy of my Lord, I shall be in danger of the awful judgment
pronounced on those who do evil that good may come, who shall say in
that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy
name cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?&nbsp;
And then will He protest unto them&mdash;I never knew you.&nbsp; Depart
from me, ye that work iniquity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, my friends, in all your projects for good, as in all other matters
which come before you in your mortal life, keep innocence and take heed
to the thing that is right.&nbsp; For that, and that alone, shall bring
a man peace at the last.</p>
<p>To which, may God in His mercy bring us all.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON VIII.&nbsp; MOTHER&rsquo;S LOVE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley, Second Sunday in Lent</i>, 1872.</p>
<p>St Matthew xv. 22-28.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, behold, a woman of Canaan
came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy
on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with
a devil.&nbsp; But he answered her not a word.&nbsp; And his disciples
came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.&nbsp;
But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.&nbsp; Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
help me.&nbsp; But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the
children&rsquo;s bread, and to cast it to dogs.&nbsp; And she said,
Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master&rsquo;s
table.&nbsp; Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is
thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.&nbsp; And her daughter
was made whole from that very hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you want a proof from Scripture that there are two sides to our
blessed Lord&rsquo;s character&mdash;that He is a Judge and an Avenger
as well as a Saviour and a Pardoner&mdash;that He is infinitely severe
as well as infinitely merciful&mdash;that, while we may come boldly
to His throne of grace to find help and mercy in time of need, we must,
at the same time, tremble before His throne of justice&mdash;if you
want a proof of all this, I say, then look at the Epistle and the Gospel
for this day.&nbsp; Put them side by side, and compare them, and you
will see how perfectly they shew, one after the other, the two sides.</p>
<p>The Epistle for the day tells men and women that they must lead moral,
pure, and modest lives.&nbsp; It does not advise them to do so.&nbsp;
It does not say, It will be better to do so, more proper and conducive
to the good of society, more likely to bring you to heaven at last.&nbsp;
It says, You must, for it is the commandment of the Lord Jesus, and
the will of God.&nbsp; Let no man encroach on or defraud his brother
in the matter, says St Paul; by which he means, Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; &ldquo;Because that
the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you
and testified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friends, people talk loosely of the Thunder of Sinai and the rigour
of Moses&rsquo; law, and set them against what they call the gentle
voice of the Gospel, and the mild religion of Christ.&nbsp; Why, here
are the Thunders of Sinai uttered as loud as ever, from the very foot
of the Cross of Christ; and the terrible, &ldquo;Thou shalt not,&rdquo;
of Moses&rsquo; law, with the curse of God for a penalty on the sinner,
uttered by the Apostle of Faith, and Freedom, in the name of Christ
and of God.&nbsp; St Paul is not afraid to call Christ an Avenger.&nbsp;
How could he be?&nbsp; He believed that it was Christ who spoke to Moses
on Sinai&mdash;the very same Christ who prayed for His murderers, &ldquo;Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he knew
that Christ was the eternal Son of God, the same yesterday, to-day,
and for ever; that He had not changed since Moses&rsquo; time, and could
never change; that what He forbade in Moses&rsquo; time, hated in Moses&rsquo;
time, and avenged in Moses&rsquo; time, He would forbid, and hate, and
avenge for ever.&nbsp; And that, therefore, he who despises the warnings
of the Law despises not man merely, but God, who has also given to us
His Holy Spirit to know what is unchangeable, the everlastingly right,
from what is everlastingly wrong.&nbsp; So much for that side of our
Lord&rsquo;s character; so much for sinners who, after their hardness
and impenitent hearts, treasure up for themselves wrath against the
day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, in the
day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according
to St Paul&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>
<p>But, when we turn to the Gospel for the day, we see the other side
of our Lord&rsquo;s character, boundless condescension and boundless
charity.&nbsp; We see Him there still a Judge, as He always is and always
will be, judging the secrets of a poor woman&rsquo;s heart, and that
woman a heathen.&nbsp; He judges her openly, in public, before His disciples.&nbsp;
But He is a Judge who judges righteous judgment, and not according to
appearances; who is no respecter of persons; who is perfectly fair,
even though the woman be a heathen: and, instead of condemning her and
driving her away, He acquits her, He grants her prayer, He heals her
daughter, even though that daughter was also a heathen, and one who
knew Him not.&nbsp; I say our Lord judged the woman after He had tried
her, as gold is tried in the fire.&nbsp; Why He did so, we cannot tell.&nbsp;
Perhaps He wanted, by the trial, to make her a better woman, to bring
out something noble which lay in her heart unknown to her, though not
to Him who knew what was in man.&nbsp; Perhaps He wished to shew his
disciples, who looked down on her as a heathen dog, that a heathen,
too, could have faith, humility, nobleness, and grace of heart.&nbsp;
Be that as it may, when the poor woman came crying to Him, He answered
her not a word.&nbsp; His disciples besought Him to send her away&mdash;and
I am inclined to think that they wished Him to grant her what she asked,
simply to be rid of her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Send her away,&rdquo; they said,
&ldquo;for she crieth after us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our Lord, we learn from
St Mark, did not wish to be known in that place just then.&nbsp; The
poor woman, with her crying, was drawing attention to them, and, perhaps,
gathering a crowd.&nbsp; Somewhat noisy and troublesome, perhaps she
was, in her motherly eagerness.&nbsp; But our Lord was still seemingly
stern.&nbsp; He would not listen, it seemed, to His disciples any more
than to the heathen woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not sent but unto the lost
sheep of the house of Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; So our Lord said, and (what
is worth remembering) if He said so, what He said was true.&nbsp; He
was the King of the people of Israel, the Royal Prince of David&rsquo;s
line; and, as a man, His duty was only to His own people.&nbsp; And
this woman was a Greek, a Syro-phenician by nation&mdash;of a mixed
race of people, notoriously low and profligate, and old enemies of the
Jews.</p>
<p>Then, it seems, He went into a house, and would have no man know
it.&nbsp; But, says St Mark, &ldquo;He could not be hid.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The mother&rsquo;s wit found our Lord out, and the mother&rsquo;s heart
urged her on, and, in spite of all His rebuffs, she seems to have got
into the house and worshipped Him.&nbsp; She &ldquo;fell at His feet,&rdquo;
says St Mark&mdash;doubtless bowing her forehead to the ground, in the
fashion of those lands&mdash;an honour which was paid, I believe, only
to persons who were royal or divine.&nbsp; So she confessed that He
was a king&mdash;perhaps a God come down on earth&mdash;and again she
cried to Him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord, help me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what was
our Lord&rsquo;s answer&mdash;seemingly more stern than ever?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take
the children&rsquo;s bread and cast it unto the dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hard
words.&nbsp; Yes: but all depends on how they were spoken.&nbsp; All
depends on our Lord&rsquo;s look as He spoke them, and, even more, on
the tone of His voice.&nbsp; We all know that two men may use the very
same words to us;&mdash;and the one shall speak sneeringly, brutally,
and raise in us indignation or despair; another shall use the same words,
but solemnly, tenderly, and raise in us confidence and hope.&nbsp; And
so it may have been&mdash;so, I fancy, it must have been&mdash;with
the tone of our Lord&rsquo;s voice, with the expression of His face.&nbsp;
Did He speak with a frown, or with something like a smile?&nbsp; There
must have been some tenderness, meaningness, pity in His voice which
the quick woman&rsquo;s wit caught instantly, and the quick mother&rsquo;s
heart interpreted as a sign of hope.</p>
<p>Let Him call her a dog if He would.&nbsp; What matter to a mother
to be called a dog, if she could thereby save her child from a devil?&nbsp;
Perhaps she was little better than a dog.&nbsp; They were a bad people
these Syrians, quick-witted, highly civilised, but vicious, and teaching
vice to other nations, till some of the wisest Romans cursed the day
when the Syrians first spread into Rome, and debauched the sturdy Romans
with their new-fangled, foreign sins.&nbsp; They were a bad people,
and, perhaps, she had been as bad as the rest.&nbsp; But if she were
a dog, at least she felt that the dog had found its Master, and must
fawn on Him, if it were but for the hope of getting something from Him.</p>
<p>And so, in the poor heathen mother&rsquo;s heart, there rose up a
whole heaven of perfect humility, faith, adoration.&nbsp; If she were
base and mean, yet our Lord was great, and wise, and good; and that
was all the more reason why He should be magnanimous, generous, condescending,
like a true King, to the basest and meanest of His subjects.&nbsp; She
asked not for money, or honour, or this world&rsquo;s fine things: but
simply for her child&rsquo;s health, her child&rsquo;s deliverance from
some mysterious and degrading illness.&nbsp; Surely there was no harm
in asking for that.&nbsp; It was simply a mother&rsquo;s prayer, a simply
human prayer, which our Lord must grant, if He were indeed a man of
woman born, if He had a mother, and could feel for a mother, if He had
human tenderness, human pity in Him.&nbsp; And so, with her quick Syrian
wit, she answers our Lord with those wonderful words&mdash;perhaps the
most pathetic words in the whole Bible&mdash;so full of humility, of
reverence, and yet with a certain archness, almost playfulness, in them,
as it were, turning our Lord&rsquo;s words against Him; and, by that
very thing, shewing how utterly she trusted Him,&mdash;&ldquo;Truth,
Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&rsquo;
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those were the beautiful words&mdash;more beautiful to me than whole
volumes of poetry&mdash;which our Lord had as it were crushed out of
the woman&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Doubtless, He knew all the while that
they were in her heart, though not as yet shaped into words.&nbsp; Doubtless,
He was trying her, to shew His disciples&mdash;and all Christians who
should ever read the Bible&mdash;what was in her heart, what she was
capable of saying when it came to the point.&nbsp; So He tried her,
and judged her, and acquitted her.&nbsp; Out of the abundance of her
heart her mouth had spoken.&nbsp; By her words she was justified.&nbsp;
By those few words she proved her utter faith in our Lord&rsquo;s power
and goodness&mdash;perhaps her faith in His godhead.&nbsp; By those
words she proved the gentleness and humility, the graciousness and gracefulness
of her own character.&nbsp; By those words she proved, too,&mdash;and
oh, you that are mothers, is that nothing?&mdash;the perfect disinterestedness
of her mother&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; And so she conquered&mdash;as the
blessed Lord loves to be conquered&mdash;as all noble souls who are
like their blessed Lord, love to be conquered&mdash;by the prayer of
faith, of humility, of confidence, of earnestness, and she had her reward.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O woman,&rdquo; said He, the Maker of all heaven and earth, &ldquo;great
is thy faith.&nbsp; For this saying go thy way.&nbsp; Be it unto thee
even as thou wilt.&nbsp; The devil is gone out of thy daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She went, full of faith; and when she was come to her house, she found
the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>
<p>One word more, and I have done.&nbsp; I do not think that any one
who really took in the full meaning of this beautiful story, would ever
care to pray to Saints, or to the Blessed Virgin, for help; fancying
that they, and specially the Blessed Virgin, being a woman, are more
humane than our Lord, and can feel more quickly, if not more keenly,
for poor creatures in distress.&nbsp; We are not here to judge these
people, or any people.&nbsp; To their own master they stand or fall.&nbsp;
But for the honour of our Lord, we may say, Does not this story shew
that the Lord is humane enough, tender enough, to satisfy all mankind?&nbsp;
Does not this story shew that even if He seem silent at first, and does
not grant our prayers, yet still He may be keeping us waiting, as He
kept this heathen woman, only that He may be gracious to us at last?&nbsp;
Does not this story shew us especially that our Lord can feel for mothers
and with mothers; that He actually allowed Himself to be won over&mdash;if
I may use such a word in all reverence&mdash;by the wit and grace of
a mother pleading for her child?&nbsp; Was it not so?&nbsp; &ldquo;O
woman, great is thy faith.&nbsp; For this saying go thy way.&nbsp; Be
it unto thee even as thou wilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah! are not those gracious
words a comfort to every mother, bidding her, in the Lord&rsquo;s own
name, to come boldly where mothers&mdash;of all human beings&mdash;have
oftenest need to come, to the throne of Christ&rsquo;s grace, to find
mercy, and grace to help in time of need?</p>
<p>Yes, my friends, such is our Lord, and such is our God.&nbsp; Infinite
in severity to the scornful, the proud, the disobedient: infinite in
tenderness to the earnest, the humble, the obedient.&nbsp; Let us come
to Him, earnest, humble, obedient, and we shall find Him, indeed, a
refuge of the soul and body in spirit and in truth.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Thou, O Lord, art all I want.<br />All and more in thee I find.&nbsp;
Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON IX.&nbsp; GOOD FRIDAY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, 1856.</p>
<p>St. Luke xxiv. 5, 6.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why seek ye the living among the
dead?&nbsp; He is not here, but is risen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a very solemn day; for on this day the Lord Jesus Christ
was crucified.&nbsp; The question for us is, how ought we to keep it?
that is, what sort of thoughts ought to be in our minds upon this day?&nbsp;
Now, many most excellent and pious persons, and most pious books, seem
to think that we ought to-day to think as much as possible of the sufferings
of our Blessed Lord; and because we cannot, of course, understand or
imagine the sufferings of His Spirit, to think of what we can, that
is, His bodily sufferings.&nbsp; They, therefore, seem to wish to fill
our minds with the most painful pictures of agony, and shame, and death,
and sorrow; and not only with our Lord&rsquo;s sorrows, but with those
of His Blessed Mother, and of the disciples, and the holy women who
stood by His cross; they wish to stir us up to pity and horror, and
to bring before us the saddest parts of Holy Scripture, such as the
Lamentations of Jeremiah; as well as dwell at great length upon very
painful details, which may be all quite true, but of which Scripture
says nothing; as so to make this day a day of darkness, and sorrow,
and horror, just such as it would have been to us if we had stood by
Christ&rsquo;s cross, like these holy women, without expecting Him to
rise again, and believing that all was over&mdash;that all hope of Israel&rsquo;s
being redeemed was gone, and that the wicked Jews had really conquered
that perfectly good, and admirable Saviour, and put Him out of the world
for ever.</p>
<p>Now, I judge no man; to his own master he standeth or falleth; yea,
and he shall stand, for God is able to make him stand.&nbsp; But it
does seem to me that these good people are seeking the living among
the dead, and forgetting that Christ is neither on the cross nor in
the tomb, but that He is risen; and it seems to me better to bid you
follow to-day the Bible and the Church Service, and to think of what
they tell you to think of.</p>
<p>Now the Bible, it is most remarkable, never enlarges anywhere upon
even the bodily sufferings of our dear and blessed Lord.&nbsp; The evangelists
keep a silence on that point which is most lofty, dignified, and delicate.&nbsp;
What sad and dreadful things might not St. John, the beloved apostle
as he was, have said, if he had chosen, about what he saw and what he
felt, as he stood by that cross on Calvary&mdash;words which would have
stirred to pity the most cruel, and drawn tears from a heart of stone?&nbsp;
And yet all he says is, &ldquo;They crucified Him, and two other with
him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.&rdquo;&nbsp; He passes
it over, as it were, as a thing which he ought not to dwell on; and
why should we put words into St. John&rsquo;s mouth which he did not
think fit to put into his own?&nbsp; He wrote by the Spirit of God;
and therefore he knew best what to say, and what not to say.&nbsp; Why
should we try and say anything more for him?&nbsp; Scripture is perfect.&nbsp;
Let us be content with it.&nbsp; The apostles, too, in their Epistles,
never dwell on Christ&rsquo;s sufferings.&nbsp; I entreat you to remark
this.&nbsp; They never mention His death except in words of cheerfulness
and triumph.&nbsp; They seem so full of the glorious fruits of His death,
that they have, as it were, no time to speak of the death itself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who, for the joy which was set before Him, endured the cross,
despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne
of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is the apostles&rsquo; key-note.&nbsp; For
God&rsquo;s sake let it be ours too, unless we fancy that we can improve
on Scripture, or that we can feel more for our Lord than St. Paul did.&nbsp;
In the Lessons, the Psalms, the Epistle, and Gospel for this day, you
find just the same spirit.&nbsp; All except one Psalm are songs of hope,
joy, deliverance, triumph.&nbsp; The Collects for this day, which are
particularly remarkable, being three in number, and evidently meant
to teach us the key-note of Good Friday, make no mention of our Lord&rsquo;s
sufferings, save to say that He was <i>contented</i>, &ldquo;contented
to be betrayed, and given up into the hands of wicked men, and to suffer
death upon the cross,&rdquo; but are full of prayers that the glorious
fruits of His death may be fulfilled, not only in us and all Christians,
but in the very heathen who have not known Him; drawing us away, as
it were, from looking too closely upon the cross itself, lest we should
forget what the cross meant, what the cross conquered, what the cross
gained, for us and mankind.</p>
<p>Surely, this was not done without a reason.&nbsp; And I cannot but
think the reason was to keep us from seeking the living among the dead;
to keep us from knowing Christ any longer after the flesh, and spending
tears and emotions over His bodily sufferings; to keep us from thinking
and sorrowing too much over the dead Christ, lest we should forget,
as some do, that He is alive for evermore; and while they weep over
the dead Christ or the crucifix, go to the blessed Virgin and the saints
to do for them all that the living Christ is longing to do for them,
if they would but go straight to Him to whom all power is given in heaven
and earth; whom St John saw, no longer hanging on the accursed tree,
but with His hair as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire,
and His voice like the sound of many waters, and His countenance as
the sun when he shineth in his strength, saying unto him, &ldquo;Fear
not, I am the first and the last; I am He that liveth and was dead,
and behold I am alive for evermore.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is what Christ
is now.&nbsp; In this shape He is looking at us now.&nbsp; In this shape
He is hearing me speak.&nbsp; In this shape He is watching every feeling
of your hearts, discerning your most secret intents, seeing through
and through the thoughts which you would confess to no human being,
hardly even to yourselves.&nbsp; This is He, a living Christ, an almighty
Christ, an all-seeing Christ, and yet a most patient and loving Christ.&nbsp;
He needs not our pity; but our gratitude, our obedience, our worship.&nbsp;
Why seek Him among the dead?&nbsp; He is not there, He is risen!&nbsp;
He is not there, He is here!&nbsp; Bow yourselves before Him now; for
He is in the midst of you; and those eyes of His, more piercing than
the mid-day sunbeams, are upon you, and your hearts, and your thoughts,
and upon mine also.&nbsp; God have mercy upon me a sinner.</p>
<p>Yes, my friends, why seek the living among the dead?&nbsp; He is
not there, but here.&nbsp; We may try to put ourselves in the place
of the disciples and the Virgin Mary, as they stood by Jesus&rsquo;
cross; but we cannot do it, for they saw Him on the cross, and thought
that He was lost to them for ever; they saw Him die, and gave up all
hope of His rising again.&nbsp; And we know that Christ is not lost
to us for ever.&nbsp; We know Christ is not on the cross, but at the
right hand of God in bliss and glory unspeakable.&nbsp; We may be told
to watch with the three Maries at the tomb of Christ: but we cannot
do as they did, for they thought that all was over, and brought sweet
spices to embalm His body, which they thought was in the tomb; and we
know that all was not over, that His body is not in the tomb, that the
grave could not hold Him, that His body is ascended into heaven; that
instead of His body needing spices to embalm it, it is His body which
embalms all heaven and earth, and is the very life of the world, and
food which preserves our souls and bodies to everlasting life.&nbsp;
We are not in the place of those blessed women; God has not put us in
their place, and we cannot put ourselves into their place; and if we
could and did, by any imaginations of our own, we should only tell ourselves
a lie.&nbsp; Good Friday was to them indeed a day of darkness, horror,
disappointment, all but despair; because Easter Day had not yet come,
and Christ had not yet risen.&nbsp; But Good Friday cannot be a day
of darkness to us, because Christ has risen, and we know it, and cannot
forget it; we cannot forget that Easter dawn, when the Sun of Righteousness
arose, never to set again.&nbsp; Has not the light of that Resurrection
morning filled with glory the cross and the grave, yea the very agony
in the Garden, and hell itself, which Christ harrowed for us?&nbsp;
Has it not risen a light to lighten the Gentiles, a joy to angels and
archangels, and saints, and all the elect of God; ay, to the whole universe
of God, so that the very stars in their courses, the trees as they bud
each spring, yea, the very birds upon the bough, are singing for ever,
in the ears of those who have ears to hear, &ldquo;Christ is risen?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And shall we, under pretence of honouring Christ and of bestowing on
Him a pity which He needs least of all, try to spend Good Friday and
Passion Week in forgetting Easter Day; try to think of Christ&rsquo;s
death as we should if He had not risen, and try to make out ourselves
and the world infinitely worse off than we really know that we are?&nbsp;
Christ has died, but He has risen again; and we must not think of one
without the other.&nbsp; Heavenly things are too important, too true,
too real&mdash;Christ is too near us, and too loving to us, too earnest
about our salvation, for us to spend our thoughts on any such attempts
(however reverently meant) at imaginative play-acting in our own minds
about His hanging on His cross, while we know that He is not on His
cross; and about watching by His tomb, when we know that He is not in
His tomb.&nbsp; Let us thank Him, bless Him, serve Him, die for Him,
if need be, in return for all He endured for us: but let us keep our
sorrow and our pity, and our tears, for our own daily sins&mdash;we
have enough of them to employ all our sorrow, and more;&mdash;and not
in voluntary humility and will-worship, against which St Paul warns
us, lose sight of our real Christ, of Him who was dead and is alive
for evermore, and dwells in us by faith; now and for ever, amen; and
hath the keys of death and hell, and has opened them for us, and for
our fathers before us, and for our children after us, and for nations
yet unborn.</p>
<p>True, this is a solemn day, for on it the Son of God fought such
a fight, that He could only win it at the price of His own life&rsquo;s
blood; and a humiliating day, for our sins helped to nail Him on the
cross&mdash;and therefore a day of humiliation and of humility.&nbsp;
Proud, self-willed thoughts are surely out of place to-day (and what
day are they in place?)&nbsp; On this day God agonised for man: but
it is a day of triumph and deliverance; and we must go home as men who
have stood by and seen a fearful fight&mdash;a fight which makes the
blood of him who watches it run cold; but we have seen, too, a glorious
victory&mdash;such a victory as never was won on earth before or since;
and we therefore must think cheerfully of the battle, for the sake of
the victory that was won; and remember that on this day death was indeed
swallowed up in victory&mdash;because death was the victory itself.</p>
<p>The question on which the fate of the whole world depended was, whether
Christ dare die; and He dared die.&nbsp; Whether Christ would endure
to the end; and He did endure.&nbsp; Whether He would utterly drink
the cup which His Father had given Him; and He drank it to the dregs;
and so by His very agony He showed Himself noble, beautiful, glorious,
adorable, beyond all that words can express.&nbsp; And so the cross
was His throne of glory; the prints of the nails in His hands and feet
were the very tokens of His triumph; His very sorrows were His bliss;
and those last words, &ldquo;It is finished,&rdquo; were no cry of despair,
but a trumpet-call of triumph, which rang from the highest heaven to
the lowest hell, proclaiming to all created things, that the very fountain
of life, by dying, had conquered death, that good had conquered evil,
love had conquered selfishness, God had conquered man, and all the enemies
of man; and that He who died was the first begotten from the dead, and
the King of all the princes of the earth, who was going to fulfil, more
and more, as the years and the ages rolled on, the glorious prayer which
we have prayed this day, graciously to behold that family for whom He
had been contented to die; and wisely and orderly to call each man to
a vocation and a ministry, in which he might duly serve God and be a
blessing to all around him, by the inspiration of Christ&rsquo;s Holy
Spirit; and to have mercy, in His own good time, upon all Jews, Turks,
heathens, and infidels, and bring them home to His flock, that they
may be saved, and made one fold under one Shepherd&mdash;Him who was
dead and is alive for evermore.</p>
<p>Therefore, my dear friends, if we wish to keep Good Friday in spirit
and in truth, we cannot do so better than by trying to carry out the
very end for which Christ died on this day; and doing our part, small
though it be, toward bringing those poor heathens home into Christ&rsquo;s
fold, and teaching them the gospel and good news that for them, too,
Christ died, and over them, too, Christ reigns alive for evermore; and
bringing them home into His flock, that they, too, may find a place
in His great family, and have their calling and ministry appointed to
them among the nations of those who are saved and walk in the light
of God and of the Lamb.</p>
<p>I have refrained till now from speaking to you much about missionaries,
and the duty which lies on us all of helping missions.&nbsp; It seemed
to me that I must first teach you to understand these first and second
collects before I went on. to the third; that I must first teach you
that you belonged to Christ&rsquo;s family, and that He had called each
of you, and appointed each of you to some order and degree in His Holy
Church.&nbsp; But now, if indeed you have learnt that&mdash;if my preaching
here for fourteen years has had any effect to teach you who and what
you are, and what your duty is, let me entreat you to go on, and take
the lesson of that third collect, and think of those poor Jews, Turks,
infidels, and heretics, who still&mdash;many a million of them&mdash;sit,
or rather wander, and fall, and lie, miserably wallowing in darkness
and the shadow of death, and think whether you cannot do something toward
helping them.&nbsp; What you can do, and how it is to be done, I will
tell you hereafter; and, by God&rsquo;s grace, I hope to see men of
God in this pulpit, who having been missionaries themselves, can tell
you better than I, what remains to be done, and how you can help to
do it.&nbsp; But take home this one thought with you, this Good Friday,&mdash;Christ,
who liveth and was dead, and behold He is alive for evermore, if He
be indeed precious to you, if you indeed feel for His sufferings, if
you indeed believe that what He bought by those sufferings was a right
to all the souls on earth, then do what you can toward repaying Him
for His sufferings, by seeing of the travail of His soul, and being
satisfied.&nbsp; All the reward He asks, or ever asked, is the hearts
of sinners, that He may convert them; the souls of sinners, that He
may save them; and they belong to Him already, for He bought them this
day with His own most precious blood.&nbsp; Do something, then, toward
helping Christ to His own.</p>

<h2>SERMON X.&nbsp; THE IMAGE OF THE EARTHLY AND THE HEAVENLY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley, Easter Day</i>, 1871.</p>
<p>1 Cor. xv. 49.&nbsp; &ldquo;As we have borne the image of the earthy,
we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This season of Easter is the most joyful of all the year.&nbsp; It
is the most comfortable time, in the true old sense of that word; for
it is the season which ought to comfort us most&mdash;that is, it gives
us strength; strength to live like men, and strength to die like men,
when our time comes.&nbsp; Strength to live like men.&nbsp; Strength
to fight against the temptation which Solomon felt when he said: &ldquo;I
have seen all the works which are done under the sun, and behold all
is vanity and vexation of spirit.&nbsp; For what has a man of all his
labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he has laboured under
the sun?&nbsp; For all his days are sorrow, and his travail grief.&nbsp;
Yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night.&nbsp; This also is vanity.&nbsp;
For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts: as the one
dieth, so dieth the other: yea, they have all one breath: so that a
man has no pre-eminence over a beast; for all is vanity.&nbsp; All go
to one place: all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.&nbsp;
Who knoweth the spirit of man that it goeth upward, and the spirit of
the beast that it goeth downward to the earth?&rdquo;&nbsp; So thought
Solomon in his temptation, and made up his mind that there was nothing
better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul
enjoy good in his labour.</p>
<p>So thought Solomon, in spite of all his wisdom, because he had not
heard the good news of Easter day.&nbsp; And so think many now, who
are called wise men and philosophers; because they, alas! for them,
will not believe the good news of Easter day.</p>
<p>But what says Easter day?&nbsp; Easter day says, Man has pre-eminence
over a beast.&nbsp; The man is redeemed from the death of the beasts
by Christ, who rose on Easter day.&nbsp; Easter day says, Wherever the
spirit of the beast goes, wherever the spirit of the brutal and the
wicked man goes, the spirit of the true Christian goes upward, to Christ,
who bought it with His precious blood.&nbsp; Easter day says, The body
may turn to the dust from which it was taken, but the spirit lives for
ever before God, who shall give it another body, as it shall please
Him, as He gives to every seed its own body.&nbsp; And, therefore, Easter
day says, There is something better for a man than to eat and drink
and enjoy himself, for to-morrow he may die, and all be over; and that
something is, to labour not merely for the meat which perishes with
the perishing body, but to labour after the fruits of the spirit&mdash;love,
joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.&nbsp;
These the life of the body does not give us; and these the death of
the body not take away from us; for they are spiritual and heavenly,
eternal and divine; and he who has them cannot die for ever.&nbsp; And
therefore, we may comfort ourselves in all our labour, if only we labour
at the one useful work on earth, to be good, and to do good, and to
make others good likewise.</p>
<p>True it is, as St. Paul says, that if in this life only we have hope
in Christ we are of all men most miserable.&nbsp; For we do not care
to be of the earth, earthy: we long to be of the heaven, heavenly.&nbsp;
We do not care to spend our time in eating and drinking, mean covetousness,
ambition, and the base pleasures of the flesh: we long after high and
noble things, which we cannot get on earth, or at best only in fragments,
and at rare moments; after the holiness and the blessedness of ourselves
and our fellow-creatures.&nbsp; But we have hope in Christ for the next
life as well as for this.&nbsp; Hope that in the next life He will give
us power to succeed, where we failed here; that He will enable us to
be good and to do good, and, if not to make others good (for there,
we trust, all will be good together), to enjoy the fulness of that pleasure
for which we have been longing on earth&mdash;the pleasure of seeing
others good, as Christ is good and perfect, as their Father in heaven
is perfect.</p>
<p>To be good ourselves, and to live for ever in good company&mdash;ah
my friends, that is true bliss.&nbsp; If we cannot reach that after
death, it were better for us that death should make an end of us, and
that when our body decays in the grave we should be annihilated, and
become nothing for ever.</p>
<p>But Easter day says to us, If you labour to create good company in
this life, by trying to make other people round you good, you shall
enjoy for ever in the next world the good company which you have helped
to make.&nbsp; If you labour to make yourself good in this life, you
shall enjoy the fruit of your labour in the next life by being good,
and, therefore, blessed for ever.&nbsp; Easter day says, Your labour
is not vanity and vexation of spirit.&nbsp; It is solid work, which
shall receive solid pay from God hereafter.&nbsp; Easter day is a pledge&mdash;I
may say a sacrament&mdash;from God to us, that He will righteously reward
all righteous work; and that, therefore, it is worth any man&rsquo;s
while to labour, to suffer, if need be even to die, in trying to be
good, noble, useful, self-sacrificing, as Christ toiled and suffered
and died and sacrificed Himself to do good.&nbsp; For then he will share
Christ&rsquo;s reward, as he has shared Christ&rsquo;s labour, and be
rewarded, as Christ was, by resurrection to eternal life.</p>
<p>And so Easter day should give us strength to live like men&mdash;the
only truly manly, truly human life; the life of being good and doing
good.</p>
<p>And strength to die.&nbsp; Men are afraid of dying, principally,
I believe, because they fear the unknown.&nbsp; It is not that they
are afraid of the pain of dying.&nbsp; It is not that they are afraid
of going to hell; for in all my experience, at least, I have met with
but one person who thought that he was going to hell.&nbsp; Neither
is it that they are afraid of not going to heaven.&nbsp; Their expectation
almost always is, that they are going thither.&nbsp; But they do not
care much to go to heaven.&nbsp; They are willing enough to go there,
because they know that they must go somewhere.&nbsp; But their notions
of what heaven will be like are by no means clear.&nbsp; They have sung
rapturous hymns in church or chapel about the heavenly Jerusalem, and
passing Jordan safe to Canaan&rsquo;s shore, with no very clear notion
of what the words meant&mdash;and small blame to them.</p>
<p>But when they think of actually dying, they feel as if to go into
the next world was to be turned out into the dark night, into an unknown
land, away from house and home, and all they have known, and all they
have loved; and they are ready to say with the good old heathen emperor,
when he lay a-dying&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Little soul of mine, wandering, kindly,<br />Companion and
guest of my body;<br />Into what place art thou now departing,<br />Shivering,
naked, and pale?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And so they shrink from death.&nbsp; They must shrink from death,
unless they will believe with their whole hearts the good news of Easter
day.&nbsp; The more thoughtful and clever they are, the more they will
shrink from death, and dread the thought of losing their bodies.&nbsp;
They have always had bodies here on earth.&nbsp; They only know themselves
as souls embodied, living in bodies; and they cannot think of themselves
in the next world with any comfort, if they may not think of themselves
as having bodies.</p>
<p>And the more loving and affectionate they are, the more they will
shrink from death, unless they believe with their whole hearts the good
news of Easter day.&nbsp; For those whom they have loved on earth have
bodies.&nbsp; Through their bodies&mdash;through their voices, their
looks, their actions, they have known them, and thus they have loved
them; and if their beloved ones are to have no bodies in the world to
come, how shall they see them? how shall they know them? how shall they
converse with them?&nbsp; It seems to them in that case neither they,
nor those they love, would be the same persons in the world to come
they are here; and that thought is lonely and dreadful, till they accept
the good news of Easter day, the thrice blessed words of St. Paul, in
his Epistle to the Corinthians, which they hear at the burial of those
whom they love and lose.&nbsp; Oh, blessed news for us, and for those
we love; those without whose company the world to come would be lonely
and cheerless to us.&nbsp; For now we can say, Tell me not that as the
beast dies, so dies the man.&nbsp; Tell me not that as Adam died because
of sin, so must I die, and all I love.&nbsp; Tell me not that it is
the universal law of nature that all things born in time must die in
time; and that every human being, animal, and plant carries in itself
from its beginning to its end a law of death, the seed of its own destruction.&nbsp;
I know all that; but I care little for it, because I know more than
that.&nbsp; I know that the man&rsquo;s body dies as the beast&rsquo;s
body dies; but I know that the body is not the man, but only the husk,
the shell of the man; that the true man, the true woman, lives on after
the loss of his mortal body; and that there is an eternal law of life,
which conquers the law of death; and by that law a fresh body will grow
up round the true man, the immortal spirit, and will be as fit&mdash;ay,
far fitter&mdash;to do his work, than this poor mortal body which has
turned to death on earth.&nbsp; Tell me not that because I am descended
from a mortal and sinful old Adam, of whom it is written that he was
of the earth, earthly, therefore my soul is a part of my body, and dies
when my body dies.&nbsp; I belong not to the old Adam, but to the new
Adam&mdash;the new Head of men, who is the Lord from heaven, the author
of eternal life to all who obey Him.&nbsp; Do not tell me that I have
nothing in me but the likeness of the old Adam, for that seems to me
and to St. Paul nothing but the likeness of the fallen savage and the
brute in human form.&nbsp; I know I have more in me&mdash;infinitely
more&mdash;than that.&nbsp; What may be in store for the savage, the
brutal, the wicked, is God&rsquo;s concern, not mine.&nbsp; But what
is in store for me I know&mdash;that as I have borne the image of the
earthly, so shall I bear the image of the heavenly, if only the Spirit
of Christ, the new Adam, be in me.&nbsp; For if Christ be in us, &ldquo;the
body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And if the Spirit of Him which raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
us, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken our mortal
bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in us.&nbsp; How He will do it I
know not; neither do I care to know.&nbsp; When He will do it I know
not; but it will be when it ought to be; and that is enough for me.&nbsp;
That He can do it I know, for He is the Maker of the universe, and to
Him all power is given in heaven and earth; and as for its being strange,
wonderful, past understanding, that matters little to me.&nbsp; That
will be but one wonder more in a world where all is wonderful&mdash;one
more mystery in an utterly mysterious universe.</p>
<p>And so, as Easter day has given us strength to live, let Easter day,
too, give us strength to die.</p>

<h2>SERMON XI.&nbsp; EASTER DAY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Chester Cathedral</i>. 1870.</p>
<p>St John xii. 24, 25.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto you,
except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone:
but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.&nbsp; He that loveth his
life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall
keep it unto life eternal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is our Lord&rsquo;s own parable.&nbsp; In it He tells us that
His death, His resurrection, His ascension, is a mystery which we may
believe, not only because the Bible tells us of it, but because it is
reasonable, and according to the laws of His universe; a fulfilment,
rather say the highest fulfilment, of one of those laws which runs through
the world of nature, and through the spiritual and heavenly world likewise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth
alone;&rdquo;&mdash;barren, useless, and truly dead to the rest of the
world around it, because it is shut up in itself, and its hidden life,
with all its wondrous powers of growth and fertility, remains undeveloped,
and will remain so, till it decays away, a worthless thing, into worthless
dust.&nbsp; But if it be buried in the earth a while, then the rich
life which lay hid in it is called out by that seeming death, and it
sprouts, tillers, and flowers, and ripens its grain&mdash;forty-fold,
sixty-fold, an hundred-fold; and so it shows God&rsquo;s mind and will
concerning it.&nbsp; It shows what is really in it, and develops the
full capabilities of its being.&nbsp; Even so, says our Lord, would
His death, His resurrection, His ascension be.</p>
<p>He speaks of His own resurrection and ascension; yes, but He speaks
first of His own death.&nbsp; Before the corn can bring forth fruit,
and show what is in it, fulfilling the law of its being, it must fall
into the ground and die.&nbsp; Before our Lord could fulfil the prophecy,
&ldquo;Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer
Thy Holy One to see corruption,&rdquo; He must fulfil the darker prophecy
of that awful 88th Psalm, the only one of all the psalms which ends
in sorrow, in all but despair, &ldquo;My soul is full of trouble, and
my life draweth nigh unto hell.&nbsp; I am counted as one of them that
go down into the pit: and I have been even as a man that hath no strength.&nbsp;
Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded and lie in the
grave, who are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So it was to be.&nbsp; So, we may believe, it needed to be.&nbsp; Christ
must suffer before He entered into His glory.&nbsp; He must die, before
He could rise.&nbsp; He must descend into hell, before He ascended into
heaven.&nbsp; For this is the law of God&rsquo;s kingdom.&nbsp; Without
a Good Friday, there can be no Easter Day.&nbsp; Without self-sacrifice,
there can be no blessedness, neither in earth nor in heaven.&nbsp; He
that loveth his life will lose it.&nbsp; He that hateth his life in
this paltry, selfish, luxurious, hypocritical world, shall keep it to
life eternal.&nbsp; Our Lord Jesus Christ fulfilled that law; because
it is the law, the law not of Moses, but of the kingdom of heaven, and
must be fulfilled by him who would fulfil all righteousness, and be
perfect, even as his Father in heaven is perfect.</p>
<p>Bear this in mind, I pray you, and whenever you think of our Lord&rsquo;s
resurrection and ascension, remember always that the background to His
triumph is&mdash;a tomb.&nbsp; Remember that it is the triumph over
suffering; a triumph of One who still bears the prints of the nails
in His hands and in His feet, and the wound of the spear in His side;
like many a poor soul who has followed Him triumphant at last, and yet
scarred, and only not maimed in the hard battle of life.&nbsp; Remember
for ever the adorable wounds of Christ.&nbsp; Remember for ever that
St John saw in the midst of the throne of God the likeness of a lamb,
as it had been slain.&nbsp; For so alone you will learn what our Lord&rsquo;s
resurrection and ascension are to all who have to suffer and to toil
on earth.&nbsp; For if our Lord&rsquo;s triumph had had no suffering
before it,&mdash;if He had conquered as the Hindoos represent their
gods as conquering their enemies, without effort, without pain, destroying
them, with careless ease, by lightnings, hurled by a hundred hands and
aided by innumerable armies of spirits,&mdash;what would such a triumph
have been to us?&nbsp; What comfort, what example to us here struggling,
often sinning, in this piecemeal world?&nbsp; We want&mdash;and blessed
be God, we have&mdash;a Captain of our salvation, who has been made
perfect by sufferings.&nbsp; We want&mdash;and blessed be God, we have&mdash;an
High Priest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,
because He has been tempted in all things like as we are, yet without
sin.&nbsp; We want&mdash;and blessed be God, we have&mdash;a King who
was glorified by suffering, that, if we are ever called on to sacrifice
ourselves, we may hope, by suffering, to share His glory.&nbsp; And
when we have remembered this, and fixed it in our minds, we may go on
safely to think of His glory, and see that (as I said at first) His
resurrection and ascension satisfy our consciences,&mdash;satisfy that
highest reason and moral sense within us, which is none other than the
voice of the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
<p>For see.&nbsp; Our Lord proved Himself to be the perfectly righteous
Being, by His very passion.&nbsp; He proved it by being righteous utterly
against His own interest; by enduring shame, torment, death, for righteousness&rsquo;
sake.&nbsp; But we feel that our Lord&rsquo;s history could not, must
not, end there.&nbsp; Our conscience, which is our highest reason, shrinks
from that thought.&nbsp; If our Lord had died and never risen, then
would His history be full of nothing but despair to all who long to
copy Him and do right at all costs.&nbsp; Our consciences demand that
God should be just.&nbsp; We say with Abraham, &ldquo;Shall not the
Judge of all the earth do right?&rdquo;&nbsp; Shall not He, who suffered
without hope of reward, have His reward nevertheless?&nbsp; Shall not
He who cried, &ldquo;My God! my God! why hast Thou forsaken Me?&rdquo;
be justified by having it proved to all the world that God had not forsaken
Him?&nbsp; But we surely cannot be more just than God.&nbsp; If we expect
God to do right, we shall surely &ldquo;find that He has done right,
and more right than we could expect or dream.&nbsp; Therefore we may
believe&mdash;I say that we must believe, if we be truly reasonable
beings&mdash;what the Bible tells us; that Christ, who suffered more
than all, was rewarded more than all; that Christ, who humbled Himself
more than all, was exalted more than all; and that His resurrection
and ascension, as St Paul tells us again and again, was meant to show
men this,&mdash;to show them that God the Father has been infinitely
just to the infinite merits of God the Son, Jesus Christ our Lord,&mdash;to
justify our Lord to all mankind by His triumph over death and hell,
and in justifying Him to justify His Father and our Father, his God
and our God.</p>
<p>And what is true of Christ must be true of us, the members of Christ.&nbsp;
He is entered into His rest, and you desire to enter into it likewise.&nbsp;
You have a right to desire it, for it is written, &ldquo;There remaineth
a rest for the people of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Remember, then, that true
rest can only be attained as He attained it, through labour.&nbsp; You
desire to be glorified with Christ.&nbsp; Remember that true glory can
only be attained in earth or heaven through self-sacrifice.&nbsp; Whosoever
will save his life shall lose it; whosoever will lose his life shall
save it.&nbsp; If that eternal moral law held good enough for the sinless
Christ, who, though He were a son, yet learned obedience by the things
which He suffered, how much more must it hold good of you and me and
all moral and rational beings,&mdash;yea, for the very angels in heaven.&nbsp;
They have not sinned.&nbsp; That we know; and we do not know; and I
presume cannot know, that they have ever suffered.&nbsp; But this at
least we know, that they have submitted.&nbsp; They have obeyed and
have given up their own wills to be the ministers of God&rsquo;s will.&nbsp;
In them is neither self-will nor selfishness; and therefore by faith,
that is, by trust and loyalty, they stand.&nbsp; And so, by consenting
to lose their individual life of selfishness, they have saved their
eternal life in God, the life of blessedness and holiness; just as all
evil spirits have lost their eternal life by trying to save their selfish
life, and be something in themselves and of themselves without respect
to God.</p>
<p>This is a great mystery; indeed, it is the mystery of the eternal,
divine, and blessed life, to which God of His mercy bring us all.&nbsp;
And therefore Good Friday, Easter Day, Ascension Day, are set as great
lights in the firmament of the spiritual year,&mdash;to remind us that
we are not animals, born to do what we like, and fulfil the sinful lusts
of the flesh, the ways whereof are death; but that we are moral and
rational beings, members of Christ, children of God, inheritors of the
kingdom of heaven; and that, therefore, I say it again, like Christ
our Lord, we must die in order to live, stoop in order to conquer.&nbsp;
They remind us that honour must grow out of humility; that freedom must
grow out of discipline; that sure conquest must be born of heavy struggles;
righteous joy out of righteous sorrow; pure laughter out of pure tears;
true strength out of the true knowledge of our own weakness; sound peace
of mind out of sound contrition; and that the heart which has a right
to cry, &ldquo;The Lord is on my side, I will not fear what man doeth
unto me,&rdquo; must be born out of the heart which has cried, &ldquo;God
be merciful to me a sinner!&rdquo; They remind us that in all things,
as says our Lord, there cannot be joy, because a man is born into the
world, unless there first be sorrow, because the hour of birth is come;
and that he who would be planted into the likeness of Christ&rsquo;s
resurrection, must, like the corn of wheat, be first planted into the
likeness of His death, and die to sin and self, that he may live to
righteousness and to God; and, like the corn of wheat, become truly
living, truly strong, truly rich, truly useful, and develop the hidden
capabilities of his being, fulfilling the mind and will of God concerning
him.&nbsp; Again, I say, this is a great mystery.&nbsp; But again, I
say, this is the law, not Moses&rsquo; law, but the Gospel law;&mdash;the
law of liberty, by which a man becomes truly free, because he has trampled
under foot the passions of his own selfish flesh, till his immortal
spirit can ascend free into the light of God, and into the love of God,
and into the beneficence of God.&nbsp; My dear friends, remember these
words, for they are true.&nbsp; Remember that St Paul always couples
with the resurrection and ascension of our bodies in the next life the
resurrection and ascension of our souls in this life; for without that,
the resurrection of our bodies would be but a resurrection to fresh
sin, and therefore to fresh misery and ruin.&nbsp; Remember his great
words about that moral resurrection and ascension of our wills, our
hearts, our characters, our actions.&nbsp; &ldquo;God,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;who is rich in mercy, for His great love, wherewith He loved
us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with
Christ, (by grace are ye saved;) and hath raised us up together, and
made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what are those heavenly places?&nbsp; And what is our duty in
them?&nbsp; Let St Paul himself answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;If ye then be risen
with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth
at the right hand of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what are they?&nbsp; Let St Paul answer once more; who should
know better than he, save Christ alone?&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatsoever things
are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, of good report.&nbsp; If there
be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, think of these things,&mdash;and, thinking of them, ask the
Holy Spirit of God to inspire you, and make a Whitsuntide in your hearts,
even as He has made, I trust, a Good Friday and an Eastertide and an
Ascension Day; that so, knowing these things, you may be blessed in
doing them; that so&mdash;and so only&mdash;may be fulfilled in you
and me or any rational being, those blessed promises which were fulfilled
in Christ our Lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;They that sow in tears shall reap in
joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth
forth good seed, shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his
sheaves with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed is the man whose strength
is in Thee, in whose heart are Thy ways; who going through the vale
of misery, use it for a well, and the pools are filled with water.&nbsp;
They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of gods appeareth
every one of them in Sion.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which may God in His great
mercy bring us all.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON XII.&nbsp; PRESENCE IN ABSENCE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, <i>third Sunday after Easter</i>. 1862.</p>
<p>St John xvi. 16.&nbsp; &ldquo;A little while, and ye shall not see
me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to
the Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Divines differ, and, perhaps, have always differed, about the meaning
of these words.&nbsp; Some think that our Lord speaks in them of His
death and resurrection.&nbsp; Others that He speaks of His ascension
and coming again in glory.&nbsp; I cannot decide which is right.&nbsp;
I dare not decide.&nbsp; It is a very solemn thing&mdash;too solemn
for me&mdash;to say of any words of our Lord&rsquo;s they mean exactly
this or that, and no more.&nbsp; For if wise men&rsquo;s words have
(as they often have) more meanings than one, and yet all true, then
surely the words of Jesus, the Son of God, who spake as never man spake&mdash;His
words, I say, may have many meanings; yea, meanings without end, meanings
which we shall never fully understand, perhaps even in heaven, and yet
all alike true.</p>
<p>But I think it is certain that most of the early Christians understood
these words of our Lord&rsquo;s ascension and coming again in glory.&nbsp;
They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during
their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the
world and to judge the quick and the dead.&nbsp; And as they waited
for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come,
a sadness fell upon them.&nbsp; Christ seemed to have left the world.&nbsp;
The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become
a very long while.&nbsp; Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did
not come in glory.&nbsp; And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church.&nbsp;
Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to
weep and lament till we saw Him again&mdash;this is the time of which
He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast
in those days.&nbsp; And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their
religion became a very sad and melancholy one&mdash;most sad in those
who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His
coming in glory.</p>
<p>What happened after that again I could tell you, but we have nothing
to do with it to-day.&nbsp; We will rather go back, and see what the
Lord&rsquo;s disciples thought He meant when He said,&mdash;&ldquo;A
little while, and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while, and
ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; One would
think, surely, that they must have taken those words to mean His death
and resurrection.&nbsp; They heard Him speak them on the very night
that He was betrayed.&nbsp; They saw Him taken from them that very night.&nbsp;
In horror and agony they saw Him mocked and scourged, crucified, dead,
and buried, as they thought for ever, and the world around rejoicing
over His death.&nbsp; Surely they wept and lamented then.&nbsp; Surely
they thought that He had gone away and left them then.</p>
<p>And the third day, beyond all hope or expectation, they beheld Him
alive again, unchanged, perfect, and glorious&mdash;as near them and
as faithful to them as ever.&nbsp; Surely that was seeing Him again
after a little while.&nbsp; Surely then their sorrow was turned to joy.&nbsp;
Surely then a man, the man of all men, was born into the world a second
time, and in them was fulfilled our Lord&rsquo;s most exquisite parable&mdash;most
human and yet most divine&mdash;of the mother remembering no more her
anguish for joy that a man is born into the world.</p>
<p>I think, too, that we may see, by the disciples&rsquo; conduct, that
they took these words of the text to speak of Christ&rsquo;s death and
resurrection.&nbsp; For when He ascended to heaven out of their sight,
did they consider that was seeing Him no more?&nbsp; Did they think
that He had gone away and left them?&nbsp; Did they, therefore, as would
have been natural, weep and lament?&nbsp; On the contrary, we are told
expressly by St Luke that they &ldquo;returned to Jerusalem with great
joy; and were continually in the temple,&rdquo; not weeping and lamenting,
but praising and blessing God.&nbsp; Plainly they did not consider that
Christ was parted from them when He ascended into heaven.&nbsp; He had
been training them during the forty days between Easter Day and Ascension
Day to think of Him as continually near them, whether they saw Him or
not.&nbsp; Suddenly He came and went again.&nbsp; Mysteriously He appeared
and disappeared.&nbsp; He showed them that though they saw not Him,
He saw them, heard their words, knew the thoughts and intents of their
hearts.&nbsp; He was always near them they felt; with them to the end
of the world, whether in sight or out of sight.&nbsp; And when they
saw Him ascend into heaven, it seemed to them no separation, no calamity,
no change in His relation to them.&nbsp; He was gone to heaven.&nbsp;
Surely He had been in heaven during those forty days, whenever they
had not seen Him.&nbsp; He had gone to the Father.&nbsp; Might He not
have been with the Father during those forty days, whenever they had
not seen Him?&nbsp; Nay; was He not always in heaven?&nbsp; Was not
heaven very near them?&nbsp; Did not Christ bring heaven with Him whithersoever
He went?&nbsp; Was He not always with the Father, the Father who fills
all things, in whom all created things live, and move, and have their
being?&nbsp; How could they have thought otherwise about our Lord, when
almost His last words to them were not, Lo, I leave you alone, but,
&ldquo;Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friends, these may seem deep words to some&mdash;doubtless they
are, for they are the words of the Bible&mdash;so deep that plain, unlearned
people can make no use of them, and draw no lesson from them.&nbsp;
I do not think so.&nbsp; I think it is of endless use and endless importance
to you how you think about Christ; and, therefore, how you think about
these forty days between our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension.&nbsp;
You may think of our Lord in two ways.&nbsp; You may think of Him as
having gone very far away, millions of millions of miles into the sky,
and not to return till the last day,&mdash;and then, I do not say that
you will weep and lament.&nbsp; There are not many who have that notion
about our Lord, and yet love Him enough to weep and lament at the thought
of His having gone away.&nbsp; But your religion, when it wakes up in
you, will be a melancholy and terrifying one.&nbsp; I say, when it wakes
up in you&mdash;for you will be tempted continually to let it go to
sleep.&nbsp; There will come over you the feeling&mdash;God forgive
us, does it not come over us all but too often?&mdash;Christ is far
away.&nbsp; Does He see me?&nbsp; Does He hear me?&nbsp; Will He find
me out?&nbsp; Does it matter very much what I say and do now, provided
I make my peace with Him before I die?&nbsp; And so will come over you
not merely a carelessness about religious duties, about prayer, reading,
church-going, but worse still, a carelessness about right and wrong.&nbsp;
You will be in danger of caring little about controlling your passions,
about speaking the truth, about being just and merciful to your fellow-men.&nbsp;
And then, when your conscience wakes you up at times, and cries, Prepare
to meet thy God! you will be terrified and anxious at the thought of
judgment, and shrink from the thought of Christ&rsquo;s seeing you.&nbsp;
My friends, that is a fearful state, though a very common one.&nbsp;
What is it but a foretaste of that dreadful terror in which those who
would not see in Christ their Lord and Saviour will call on the mountains
to fall on them, and the hills to cover them, from Him that sitteth
on the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb?</p>
<p>But, again: you may think of Christ as His truest servants, though
they might have been long in darkness, in all ages and countries have
thought of Him, sooner or later.&nbsp; And they thought of Him, as the
disciples did; as of One who was about their path and about their bed,
and spying out all their ways; as One who was in heaven, but who, for
that very reason, was bringing heaven down to earth continually in the
gracious inspirations of His Holy Spirit; as One who brought heaven
down to them as often as He visited their hearts and comforted them
with sweet assurance of His love, His faithfulness, His power&mdash;as
God grant that He may comfort those of you who need comfort.&nbsp; And
that thought, that Christ was always with them, even to the end of the
world, sobered and steadied them, and yet refreshed and comforted them.&nbsp;
It sobered them.&nbsp; What else could it do?&nbsp; Does it not sober
us to see even a picture of Christ crucified?&nbsp; How must it have
sobered them to carry, as good St Ignatius used to say of himself, Christ
crucified in his heart.&nbsp; A man to whom Christ, as it were, showed
perpetually His most blessed wounds, and said, Behold what I have endured&mdash;how
dare he give way to his passion?&nbsp; How dare he be covetous, ambitious,
revengeful, false?&nbsp; And yet it cheered and comforted them.&nbsp;
How could it do otherwise, to know all day long that He who was wounded
for their iniquities, and by whose stripes they were healed, was near
them day and night, watching over them as a father over his child, saying
to them,&mdash;&ldquo;Fear not, I am He that was dead, and am alive
for evermore, and I hold the keys of death and hell.&nbsp; Though thou
walkest through the fires, I will be with thee.&nbsp; I will never leave
thee nor forsake thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, my friends, if you wish your
life&mdash;and therefore your religion, which ought to be the very life
of your life&mdash;to be at once sober and cheerful, full of earnestness
and full of hope, believe our Lord&rsquo;s words which He spoke during
these very forty days,&mdash;&ldquo;Lo, I am with you alway, even to
the end of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Believe that heaven has not taken
Him away from you, but brought Him nearer to you; and that He has ascended
up on high, not that He, in whom alone is life, might empty this earth
of His presence, but that He might fill all things, not this earth only,
but all worlds, past, present, and to come.&nbsp; Believe that wherever
two or three are gathered together in Christ&rsquo;s name, there He
is in the midst of them; that the holy communion is the sign of His
perpetual presence; and that when you kneel to receive the bread and
wine, Christ is as near you&mdash;spiritually, indeed, and invisibly,
but really and truly&mdash;as near you as those who are kneeling by
your side.</p>
<p>And if it be so with Christ, then it is so with those who are Christ&rsquo;s,
with those whom we love.&nbsp; It is the Christ in them which we love;
and that Christ in them is their hope of glory; and that glory is the
glory of Christ.&nbsp; They are partakers of His death, therefore they
are partakers of His resurrection.&nbsp; Let us believe that blessed
news in all its fulness, and be at peace.&nbsp; A little while and we
see them; and again a little while and we do not see them.&nbsp; But
why?&nbsp; Because they are gone to the Father, to the source and fount
of all life and power, all light and love, that they may gain life from
His life, power from His power, light from His light, love from His
love&mdash;and surely not for nought?</p>
<p>Surely not for nought, my friends.&nbsp; For if they were like Christ
on earth, and did not use their powers for themselves alone, if they
are to be like Christ when they shall see Him as He is, then, more surely,
will they not use their powers for themselves, but, as Christ uses His,
for those they love.</p>
<p>Surely, like Christ, they may come and go, even now, unseen.&nbsp;
Like Christ, they may breathe upon our restless hearts and say, Peace
be unto you&mdash;and not in vain.&nbsp; For what they did for us when
they were on earth they can more fully do now that they are in heaven.&nbsp;
They may seem to have left us, and we, like the disciples, may weep
and lament.&nbsp; But the day will come when the veil shall be taken
from our eyes, and we shall see them as they are, with Christ, and in
Christ for ever; and remember no more our anguish for joy that a man
is born into the world, that another human being has entered that one
true, real, and eternal world, wherein is neither disease, disorder,
change, decay, nor death, for it is none other than the Bosom of the
Father.</p>

<h2>SERMON XIII.&nbsp; ASCENSION DAY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley.&nbsp; Chester Cathedral</i>. 1872.</p>
<p>St John viii. 58.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before Abraham was, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us consider these words awhile.&nbsp; They are most fit for our
thoughts on this glorious day, on which the Lord Jesus ascended to His
Father, and to our Father, to His God, and to our God, that He might
be glorified with the glory which He had with the Father before the
making of the world.&nbsp; For it is clear that we shall better understand
Ascension Day, just as we shall better understand Christmas or Eastertide,
the better we understand Who it was who was born at Christmas, suffered
and rose at Eastertide, and, as on this day, ascended into heaven.&nbsp;
Who, then, was He whose ascent we celebrate?&nbsp; What was that glory
which, as far as we can judge of divine things, He resumed as on this
day?</p>
<p>Let us think a few minutes, with all humility, not rashly intruding
ourselves into the things we have not seen, or meddling with divine
matters which are too hard for us, but taking our Lord&rsquo;s words
simply as they stand, and where we do not understand them, believing
them nevertheless.</p>
<p>Now it is clear that the book of Exodus and our Lord&rsquo;s words
speak of the same person.&nbsp; The Old Testament tells of a personage
who appeared to Moses in the wilderness, and who called Himself &ldquo;the
Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this personage
also calls Himself &ldquo;I AM.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I AM THAT I AM:&rdquo;
&ldquo;and He said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,
I AM hath sent me unto you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the New Testament we read of a personage who calls Himself the
Son of God, is continually called the Lord, and who tells His disciples
to call Him by that name without reproving them, though they and He
knew well what it meant&mdash;that it meant no less than this, that
He, Jesus of Nazareth, poor mortal man as He seemed, was still the Lord,
the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&nbsp; I do not say that the disciples
saw that at first, clearly or fully, till after our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection.&nbsp;
But there was one moment shortly before His death, when they could have
had no doubt who He assumed Himself to be.&nbsp; For the unbelieving
Jews had no doubt, and considered Him a blasphemer; and these were His
awful and wonderful words,&mdash;I do not pretend to understand them&mdash;I
take them simply as I find them, and believe and adore.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it, and was glad.&nbsp;
Then said the Jews unto Him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast
Thou seen Abraham?&rdquo;&nbsp; One cannot blame them for asking that
question, for Abraham had been dead then nearly two thousand years.&nbsp;
But what is our Lord&rsquo;s solemn answer?&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily, verily,
I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Am.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same name by which our Lord God had
revealed Himself to Moses in the wilderness, some sixteen hundred years
before.&nbsp; If these words were true,&mdash;and the Lord prefaces
them with Verily, verily, Amen, Amen, which was as solemn an asseveration
as any oath could be&mdash;then the Lord Jesus Christ is none other
than the God of Abraham, the God of Moses, the God of the Jews, the
God of the whole universe, past, present, and to come.</p>
<p>Let us think awhile over this wonder of all wonders.&nbsp; The more
we think over it, we shall find it not only the wonder of all wonders,
but the good news of all good news.</p>
<p>The deepest and soundest philosophers will tell us that there must
be an &ldquo;I Am.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is, as they would say, a self-existent
Being; neither made nor created, but who has made and created all things;
who is without parts and passions, and is incomprehensible, that is
cannot be comprehended, limited, made smaller or weaker, or acted on
in any way by any of the things that He has made.&nbsp; So that this
self-existing Being whom we call God, would be exactly what He is now,
if the whole universe, sun, moon, and stars, were destroyed this moment;
and would be exactly what He is now, if there had never been any universe
at all, or any thing or being except His own perfect and self-existent
Self.&nbsp; For He lives and moves and has His being in nothing.&nbsp;
But all things live and move and have their being in Him.&nbsp; He was
before all things, and by Him all things consist.&nbsp; And this is
the Catholic Faith; and not only that, this is according to sound and
right reason.&nbsp; But more: the soundest philosophers will tell you
that God must be not merely a self-existent Being, but the &ldquo;I
Am:&rdquo; that if God is a Spirit, and not merely a name for some powers
and laws of brute nature and matter, He must be able to say to Himself,
&ldquo;I Am:&rdquo; that He must know Himself, that He must be conscious
of Himself, of who and what He is, as you and I are conscious of ourselves,
and more or less of who and what we are.&nbsp; And this, also, I believe
to be true, and rational, and necessary to the Catholic Faith.</p>
<p>But they will tell you again&mdash;and this, too, is surely true&mdash;that
I Am must be the very name of God, because God alone can say perfectly,
&ldquo;I Am,&rdquo; and no more.&nbsp; You and I dare not, if we think
accurately, say of ourselves, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may say,
I am this or that; I am a man; I am an Englishman; but we must not say,
&ldquo;I am;&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;I exist of myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We must say&mdash;not I am; but I become, or have become; I was made;
I was created; I am growing, changing; I depend for my very existence
on God and God&rsquo;s will, and if He willed, I should be nothing and
nowhere in a moment.&nbsp; God alone can say, I Am, and there is none
beside Me, and never has, nor can be.&nbsp; I exist, absolutely, and
simply; because I choose to exist, and get life from nothing; for I
Am the Life, and give life to all things.&nbsp; But you may say, What
is all this to us?&nbsp; It is very difficult to understand, and dreary,
and even awful.&nbsp; Why should we care for it, even if it be true?&nbsp;
Yes, my friends; philosophy may be true, and yet be dreary, and awful,
and have no gospel and good news in it at all.&nbsp; I believe it never
can have; that only in Revelation, and in the Revelation of our Lord
Jesus Christ, can poor human beings find any gospel and good news at
all.&nbsp; And sure I am, that that is an awful thought, a dreary thought,
a crushing thought, which makes a man feel as small, and worthless,
and helpless, and hopeless, as a grain of dust, or a mote in the sunbeam&mdash;that
thought of God for ever contained in Himself, and saying for ever to
Himself, &ldquo;I Am, and there is none beside Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Gospel, the good news of the Old Testament, the Gospel, the
good news of the New Testament, is the Revelation of God and God&rsquo;s
ways, which began on Christmas Day, and finished on Ascension Day: and
what is that?&nbsp; What but this?&nbsp; That God does not merely say
to Himself in Majesty, &ldquo;I Am;&rdquo; but that He goes out of Himself
in Love, and says to men, &ldquo;I Am.&rdquo;&nbsp; That He is a God
who has spoken to poor human beings, and told them who He was; and that
He, the I Am, the self-existent One, the Cause of life, of all things,
even the Maker and Ruler of the Universe, can stoop to man&mdash;and
not merely to perfect men, righteous men, holy men, wise men, but to
the enslaved, the sinful, the brutish&mdash;that He may deliver them,
and teach them, and raise them from the death of sin, to His own life
of righteousness.</p>
<p>Do you not see the difference, the infinite difference, and the good
news in that?&nbsp; Do you not see a whole heaven of new hope and new
duty is opened to mankind in that one fact&mdash;God has spoken to man.&nbsp;
He, the I Am, the Self-Existent, who needs no one, and no thing, has
turned aside, as it were, and stooped from the throne of heaven, again
and again, during thousands of years, to say to you, and me, and millions
of mankind, I Am your God.&nbsp; How do you prosper?&mdash;what do you
need?&mdash;what are you doing?&mdash;for if you are doing justice to
yourself and your fellow-men, then fear not that I shall be just to
you.</p>
<p>And more.&nbsp; When that I Am, the self-existent God, could not
set sinful men right by saying this, then did He stoop once more from
the throne of the heavens to do that infinite deed of love, of which
it is written, that He who called Himself &ldquo;I Am,&rdquo; the God
of Abraham, was conceived of the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary,
crucified under Pontius Pilate, rose again the third day, and ascended
into heaven,&mdash;that He might send down the Spirit of the &ldquo;I
Am,&rdquo; the Holy Spirit who proceedeth from the Father and the Son,
upon all who ask Him; that they may be holy as God is holy, and perfect
as God is perfect.&nbsp; Yes, my dear friends, remember that, and live
in the light of that; the gospel of good news of the Incarnation of
Jesus Christ, very God of very God begotten.&nbsp; Know that God has
spoken to you as He spoke to Abraham, and said,&mdash;I am the Almighty
God, walk before Me, and be thou perfect.&nbsp; Know that He has spoken
to you as He spoke to Moses, saying,&mdash;I am the Lord thy God, who
have brought you, and your fathers before you, out of the spiritual
Egypt of heathendom, and ignorance, sin, and wickedness, into the knowledge
of the one, true, and righteous God.&nbsp; But know more, that He has
spoken to you by the mouth of Jesus Christ, saying,&mdash;I am He that
died in the form of mortal man upon the cross for you.&nbsp; And, behold,
I am alive for evermore; and to me all power is given in heaven and
earth.</p>
<p>Yes, my friends, let us lay to heart, even upon this joyful day,
the awful warnings of the Epistle to the Hebrews,&mdash;God, the I Am,
has spoken to us; God, the I Am, is speaking to us now.&nbsp; See that
you refuse not Him that speaketh; for if they escaped not who refused
Moses that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape if we turn
away from Him that speaketh from heaven; wherefore follow peace with
all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord, and
have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and
godly fear.&nbsp; For our God is a consuming fire.&nbsp; To those who
disobey Him, eternal wrath; to those who love Him, eternal love.</p>
<p>Yes, my friends.&nbsp; Let us believe that, and live in the light
of that, with reverence and godly fear, all the year round.&nbsp; But
let us specially to-day, as far as our dull feelings and poor imaginations
will allow us; let us, I say, adore the ascended Saviour, who rules
for ever, a Man in the midst of the throne of the universe, and that
Man&mdash;oh, wonder of wonders!&mdash;slain for us; and let us say
with St Paul of old, with all our hearts and minds and souls:&mdash;Now
to the King of the Ages, immortal, invisible, with the Father and the
Holy Spirit, be honour and glory, for ever and ever.&nbsp; Amen!</p>

<h2>SERMON XIV.&nbsp; THE COMFORTER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley.&nbsp; Sunday after Ascension Day</i>. 1868.</p>
<p>St John xv. 26.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the Comforter is come, whom I will
send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth
from the Father, he shall testify of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some writers, especially when they are writing hymns, have fallen
now-a-days into a habit of writing of the Holy Spirit of God, in a tone
of which I dare not say that it is wrong or untrue; but of which I must
say, that it is one-sided.&nbsp; And if there are two sides to a matter,
it must do us harm to look at only one of them.&nbsp; And I think that
it does people harm to hear the Holy Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost,
the Comforter, spoken of in terms, not of reverence, but of endearment.&nbsp;
For consider: He is the</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Creator-Spirit, by whose aid<br />The world&rsquo;s
foundations first were laid,&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>the life-giving Spirit of whom it is written, Thou sendest forth
Thy Spirit, and things live, and Thou renewest the face of the earth.</p>
<p>But He is the destroying Spirit too; who can, when He will, produce
not merely life, but death; who can, and does send earthquakes, storm,
and pestilence; of whom Isaiah writes&mdash;&ldquo;All flesh is as grass,
and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.&nbsp;
The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the Spirit of the Lord
bloweth upon it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think it does people harm to hear this
awful and almighty being, I say, spoken of merely as the &ldquo;sweet
Spirit,&rdquo; and &ldquo;gentle dove&rdquo;&mdash;words which are true,
but only true, if we remember other truths, equally true of Him, concerning
whom they are spoken.&nbsp; The Spirit of God, it seems to me, is too
majestic a being to be talked of hastily as &ldquo;sweet.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Words may be true, and yet it may not be always quite reverent to use
them.&nbsp; An earthly sovereign may be full of all human sweetness
and tenderness, yet we should not dare to address him as &ldquo;sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, indeed, some of this talk about the Holy Spirit is not warranted
by Scripture at all.&nbsp; In one of the hymns, for instance, in our
hymn-book&mdash;an excellent hymn in other respects, there is a line
which speaks of the Holy Spirit as possessing &ldquo;The brooding of
the gentle dove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, this line is really little but pretty sentiment, made up of
false uses of Scripture.&nbsp; The Scripture speaks once of the Holy
Spirit of God brooding like a bird over its nest.&nbsp; But where?&nbsp;
In one of the most mysterious, awful, and important of all texts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the earth was without form and void.&nbsp; And the Spirit
of God moved (brooded) over the face of the deep.&rdquo;&nbsp; What
has this&mdash;the magnificent picture of the Life-giving Spirit brooding
over the dead world, to bring it into life again, and create from it
sea and land, heat and fire, and cattle and creeping things after their
kind, and at last man himself, the flower and crown of things;&mdash;what
has that to do with the brooding of a gentle dove?</p>
<p>But the Holy Spirit is spoken of in Scripture under the likeness
of a dove?&nbsp; True, and here is another confusion.&nbsp; The Dove
is not the emblem of gentleness in the Bible: but the Lamb.&nbsp; The
dove is the emblem of something else, pure and holy, but not of gentleness;
and therefore the Holy Spirit is not spoken of in Scripture as brooding
as a gentle dove; but very differently, as it seems to me.&nbsp; St
Matthew and St John say, that at our Lord&rsquo;s baptism the Holy Spirit
was seen, not brooding, but descending from heaven as a dove.&nbsp;
To any one who knows anything of doves, who will merely go out into
the field or the farm-yard and look at them, and who will use his own
eyes, that figure is striking enough, and grand enough.&nbsp; It is
the swiftness of the dove, and not its fancied gentleness that is spoken
of.&nbsp; The dove appearing, as you may see it again and again, like
a speck in the far off sky, rushing down with a swiftness which outstrips
the very eagle; returning surely to the very spot from which it set
forth, though it may have flown over hundreds of miles of land, and
through the very clouds of heaven.&nbsp; It is the sky-cleaving force
and swiftness, the unerring instinct of the dove, and not a sentimental
gentleness to which Scripture likens that Holy Spirit, which like the
rushing mighty wind bloweth whither it listeth, and thou hearest the
sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, or whither it goeth;&mdash;that
Holy Spirit who, when He fell on the apostles, fell in tongues of fire,
and shook all the house where they were sitting; that Holy Spirit of
whom one of the wisest Christians who ever lived, who knew well enough
the work of the Spirit, arguing just as I am now against the fancy of
associating the Holy Spirit merely with pretty thoughts of our own,
and pleasant feelings of our own, and sentimental raptures of our own,
said, &ldquo;Wouldst thou know the manner of spiritual converse?&nbsp;
Of the way in which the Spirit of God works in man?&nbsp; Then it is
this: He hath taken me up and dashed me down.&nbsp; Like a lion, I look,
that He will break all my bones.&nbsp; From morning till evening, Thou
wilt make an end of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But people are apt to forget this.&nbsp; And therefore they fall
into two mistakes.&nbsp; They think of the Holy Spirit as only a gentle,
and what they call a dove-like being; and they forget what a powerful,
awful, literally formidable being He is.&nbsp; They lose respect for
the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; They trifle with Him; and while they sing hymns
about His gentleness and sweetness, they do things which grieve and
shock Him; forgetting the awful warning which He, at the very outset
of the Christian Church, gave against such taking of liberties with
God the Holy Ghost:&mdash;how Ananias and Sapphira thought that the
Holy Spirit was One whom they might honour with their lips, and more,
with their outward actions, but who did not require truth in the inward
parts, and did not care for their telling a slight falsehood that they
might appear more generous than they really were in the eyes of men;
and how the answer of the Holy Spirit of God was that He struck them
both dead there and then for a warning to all such triflers, till the
end of time.</p>
<p>Another mistake which really pious and good people commit, is, that
they think the Holy Spirit of God to be merely, or little beside, certain
pleasant frames, and feelings, and comfortable assurances, in their
own minds.&nbsp; They do not know that these pleasant frames and feelings
really depend principally on their own health: and, then, when they
get out of health, or when their brain is overworked, and the pleasant
feelings go, they are terrified and disheartened, and complain of spiritual
dryness, and cry out that God&rsquo;s Spirit has deserted them, and
are afraid that God is angry with them, or even that they have committed
the unpardonable sin: not knowing that God is not a man that He should
lie, nor a son of man that He should repent; that God is as near them
in the darkness as in the light; that whatever their own health, or
their own feelings may be, yet still in God they live, and move, and
have their being; that to God&rsquo;s Spirit they owe all which raises
them above the dumb animals; that nothing can separate them from the
love of Him who promised that He would not leave us comfortless, but
send to us His Holy Ghost to comfort us, and exalt us to the same place
whither He has gone before.</p>
<p>Now, why do I say all this?&nbsp; To take away comfort from you?&nbsp;
To make you fear and dread the Spirit of God?&nbsp; God forbid!&nbsp;
Who am I, to take away comfort from any human being!&nbsp; I say it
to give yon true comfort, to make you trust and love the Holy Spirit
utterly, to know Him&mdash;His strength and His wisdom as well as His
tenderness and gentleness.</p>
<p>You know that afflictions do come&mdash;terrible bereavements, sorrows
sad and strange.&nbsp; My sermon does not make them come.&nbsp; There
they are, God help us all, and too many of them, in this world.&nbsp;
But from whom do they come?&nbsp; Who is Lord of life and death?&nbsp;
Who is Lord of joy and sorrow?&nbsp; Is not that the question of all
questions?&nbsp; And is not the answer the most essential of all answers?&nbsp;
It is the Holy Spirit of God; the Spirit who proceedeth from the Father
and the Son; the Spirit of the Father who so loved the world that He
spared not His only begotten Son; the Spirit of the Son who so loved
the world, that He stooped to die for it upon the Cross; the Spirit
who is promised to lead you into all truth, that you may know God, and
in the knowledge of Him find everlasting life; the Spirit who is the
Comforter, and says, I have seen thy ways and will heal thee, I will
lead thee also, and restore comforts to thee and to thy mourners.&nbsp;
I speak peace to him that is near, and to him that is far off, saith
the Lord; and I will heal him.&nbsp; Is it not the most blessed news,
that He who takes away, is the very same as He who gives?&nbsp; That
He who afflicts is the very same as He who comforts?&nbsp; That He of
whom it is written that, &ldquo;as a lion, so will He break all my bones;
from day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me;&rdquo; is the same
as He of whom it is written, &ldquo;He shall gather the lambs in His
arms, and carry them, and shall gently lead those that are with young;&rdquo;
and, again, &ldquo;as a beast goeth down into the valley, so the Spirit
of the Lord caused him to rest?&rdquo;&nbsp; That He of whom it is written,
&ldquo;Our God is a consuming fire,&rdquo; is the same as He who has
said, &ldquo;When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned?&rdquo;&nbsp;
That He who brings us into &ldquo;the valley of the shadow of death,&rdquo;
is the same as He of whom it is said, &ldquo;Thy rod and Thy staff they
comfort me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is not that blessed news?&nbsp; Is it not the
news of the Gospel; and the only good news which people will really
care for, when they are tormented, not with superstitious fears and
doctrines of devils which man&rsquo;s diseased conscience has originated,
but tormented with the real sorrows, the rational fears of this stormy
human life.</p>
<p>We all like comfort.&nbsp; But what kind of comfort do we not merely
like but need?&nbsp; Merely to be comfortable?&mdash;To be free from
pain, anxiety, sorrow?&mdash;To have only pleasant faces round us, and
pleasant things said to us?&nbsp; If we want that comfort, we shall
very seldom have it.&nbsp; It will be very seldom good for us to have
it.&nbsp; The comfort which poor human beings want in such a world as
this, is not the comfort of ease, but the comfort of strength.&nbsp;
The comforter whom we need is not one who will merely say kind things,
but give help&mdash;help to the weary and heavy laden heart which has
no time to rest.&nbsp; We need not the sunny and smiling face, but the
strong and helping arm.&nbsp; For we may be in that state that smiles
are shocking to us, and mere kindness,&mdash;though we may be grateful
for it&mdash;of no more comfort to us than sweet music to a drowning
man.&nbsp; We may be miserable, and unable to help being miserable,
and unwilling to help it too.&nbsp; We do not wish to flee from our
sorrow, we do not wish to forget our sorrow.&nbsp; We dare not; it is
so awful, so heartrending, so plain spoken, that God, the master and
tutor of our hearts must wish us to face it and endure it.&nbsp; Our
Father has given us the cup&mdash;shall we not drink it?&nbsp; But who
will help us to drink the bitter cup?&nbsp; Who will be the comforter,
and give us not mere kind words, but strength?&nbsp; Who will give us
the faith to say with Job, &ldquo;Though He slay me, yet will I trust
in Him?&rdquo;&nbsp; Who will give us the firm reason to look steadily
at our grief, and learn the lesson it was meant to teach?&nbsp; Who
will give us the temperate will, to keep sober and calm amid the shocks
and changes of mortal life?&nbsp; Above all, I may say&mdash;Who will
lead us into all truth?&nbsp; How much is our sorrow increased&mdash;how
much of it is caused by simple ignorance!&nbsp; Why has our anxiety
come?&nbsp; How are we to look at it?&nbsp; What are we to do?&nbsp;
Oh, that we had a comforter who would lead us into all truth:&mdash;not
make us infallible, or all knowing, but lead us into truth; at least
put us in the way of truth, put things in their true light to us, and
give us sound and rational views of life and duty.&nbsp; Oh, for a comforter
who would give us the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit
of counsel and ghostly strength, the spirit of knowledge and true godliness,
and fill us with that spirit of God&rsquo;s holy fear, which would make
us not superstitious, not slavish, not anxious, but simply obedient,
loyal and resigned.</p>
<p>If we had such a Comforter as that, could we not take evil from his
hands, as well as good?&nbsp; We have had fathers of our flesh who corrected
us, and we gave them reverence.&nbsp; They chastised us, but we loved
and trusted them, because we knew that they loved and trusted us&mdash;chastised
us to make us better&mdash;chastised us because they trusted us to become
better.&nbsp; But if we can find a Father of our spirits, of our souls,
shall we not rather be in subjection to Him and live?&nbsp; If He sent
us a Comforter, to comfort and guide, and inspire, and strengthen us,
shall we not say of that Comforter&mdash;&ldquo;Though He slay me, yet
will I trust in Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we had such a Comforter as that, we should not care, if He seemed
at times stern, as well as kind; we could endure rebuke and chastisement
from Him, if we could only get from Him wisdom to understand the rebuke,
and courage to bear the chastisement.&nbsp; Where is that Comforter?&nbsp;
God answers:&mdash;That Comforter am I, the God of heaven and earth.&nbsp;
There are comforters on earth who can help thee with wise words and
noble counsel, can be strong as man, and tender as woman.&nbsp; Then
God can be more strong than man, and more tender than woman likewise.&nbsp;
And when the strong arm of man supports thee no longer, yet under thee
are the everlasting arms of God.</p>
<p>Oh, blessed news, that God Himself is the Comforter.&nbsp; Blessed
news, that He who strikes will also heal: that He who gives the cup
of sorrow, will also give the strength to drink it.&nbsp; Blessed news,
that chastisement is not punishment, but the education of a Father.&nbsp;
Blessed news, that our whole duty is the duty of a child&mdash;of the
Son who said in His own agony, &ldquo;Father, not my will, but thine
be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Blessed news, that our Comforter is the Spirit
who comforted Christ the Son Himself; who proceeds both from the Father
and from the Son; and who will therefore testify to us both of the Father
and the Son, and tell us that in Christ we are indeed, really and literally,
the children of God who may cry to Him, &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; with full
understanding of all that that royal word contains.&nbsp; Blessed, too,
to find that in the power of the Divine Majesty, we can acknowledge
the unity, and know and feel that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are
all one in love to the creatures whom they have made&mdash;their glory
equal, for the glory of each and all is perfect charity, and their majesty
co-eternal, because it is a perfect majesty; whose justice is mercy,
whose power is goodness, its very sternness love, love which gives hope
and counsel, and help and strength, and the true life which this world&rsquo;s
death cannot destroy.</p>

<h2>SERMON XV.&nbsp; THOU ART WORTHY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, 1869.&nbsp; <i>Chester Cathedral</i>, 1870.&nbsp;
<i>Trinity Sunday.</i></p>
<p>Revelation iv. 11.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive
glory and honour and power: for Thou hast created all things, and for
Thy pleasure they are and were created.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am going to speak to you on a deep matter, the deepest and most
important of all matters, and yet I hope to speak simply.&nbsp; I shall
say nothing which you cannot understand, if you will attend.&nbsp; I
shall say nothing, indeed, which you could not find out for yourselves,
if you will think, and use your own common sense.&nbsp; I wish to speak
to you of Theology&mdash;of God Himself.&nbsp; For this Trinity Sunday
of all the Sundays of the year, is set apart for thinking of God Himself&mdash;not
merely of our own souls, though we must never forget them, nor of what
God has done for our souls, though we must never forget that&mdash;but
of what God is Himself, what He would be if we had no souls&mdash;if
there were, and had been from the beginning, no human beings at all
upon the earth.</p>
<p>Now, if we look at any living thing&mdash;an animal, say, or a flower,
and consider how curiously it is contrived, our common sense will tell
us at once that some one has made it; and if any one answers&mdash;Oh!
the flower was not made, it grew&mdash;our common sense would tell us
that that was only a still more wonderful contrivance, and that there
must be some one who gave it the power of growing, and who makes it
grow.&nbsp; And so our common sense would tell us, as it told the heathens
of old, that there must be <i>gods</i>&mdash;beings whom we cannot see,
who made the world.&nbsp; But if we watch things more closely, we should
find out that all things are made more or less upon the same plan; that
(and I tell you that this is true, strange as it may seem) all animals,
however different they may seem to our eyes, are made upon the same
plan; all plants and flowers, however different they may seem, are made
upon the same plan; all stones, and minerals, and earths, however different
they may seem, are made upon the same plan.&nbsp; Then common sense
would surely tell us, one God made all the animals, one God made all
the plants, one God made all the earths and stones.&nbsp; But if we
watch more closely still, we should find that the plants could not live
without the animals, nor the animals without the plants, nor either
of them without the soil beneath our feet, and the air and rain above
our heads.&nbsp; That everything in the world worked together on one
plan, and each thing depended on everything else.&nbsp; Then common
sense would tell us, one God must have made the whole world.&nbsp; But
if we watched more closely again, or rather, if we asked the astronomers,
who study the stars and heavens, they would tell us that all the worlds
over our heads, all the stars that spangle the sky at night, were made
upon the same plan as our earth&mdash;that sun and moon, and all the
host of heaven, move according to the same laws by which our earth moves,
and as far as we can find out, have been made in the same way as our
earth has been made, and that these same laws must have been going on,
making worlds after worlds, for hundreds of thousands of years, and
ages beyond counting, and will, in all probability, go on for countless
ages more.&nbsp; Then common sense will tell us, the same God has made
all worlds, past, present, and to come.&nbsp; There is but one God,
the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.</p>
<p>So we should learn something of how all things were made; and then
would come a second question, why all things were made?&nbsp; Why did
God make the worlds?</p>
<p>Let us begin with a very simple example.&nbsp; Simple things will
often teach us most.&nbsp; You see a flower growing, not in a garden,
but wild in a field or wood.&nbsp; You admire its beautiful colours,
or if it is fragrant, its sweet scent.&nbsp; Now, why was that flower
put there?&nbsp; You may answer, &ldquo;to please me.&rdquo;&nbsp; My
dear friends, I should be the last person to deny that.&nbsp; I can
never see a child picking a nosegay, much less a little London child,
born and bred and shut up among bricks and mortar, when it gets for
the first time into a green field, and throws itself instinctively upon
the buttercups and daisies, as if they were precious jewels and gold;&mdash;I
never can see that sight, I say, without feeling that there are such
things as final causes&mdash;I mean that the great Father in heaven
put those flowers into that field on purpose to give pleasure to His
human children.&nbsp; But then comes the question, Of all the flowers
in a single field, is one in ten thousand ever looked at by child or
by men?&nbsp; And yet they are just as beautiful as the rest; and God
has, so to speak, taken just as much pains with the many beautiful things
which men will never see, as with the few, very few, which men may see.&nbsp;
And when one thinks further about this&mdash;when one thinks of the
vast forests in other lands which the foot of man has seldom or never
trod, and which, when they are entered, are found to be full of trees,
flowers, birds, butterflies, so beautiful and glorious, that anything
which we see in these islands is poor and plain in comparison with them;
and when we remember that these beautiful creatures have been going
on generation after generation, age after age, unseen and unenjoyed
by any human eyes, one must ask, Why has God been creating all that
beauty? simply to let it all, as it were, run to waste, till after thousands
of years one traveller comes, and has a hasty glimpse of it?&nbsp; Impossible.&nbsp;
Or again&mdash;and this is an example still more strange, and yet it
is true.&nbsp; We used to think till within a very few years past, that
at the bottom of the deep sea there were no living things&mdash;that
miles below the surface of the ocean, in total darkness, and under such
a weight of water as would crush us to a jelly, there could be nothing,
except stones, and sand, and mud.&nbsp; But now it is found out that
the bottom of the deepest seas, and the utter darkness into which no
ray of light can ever pierce, are alive and swarming with millions of
creatures as cunningly and exquisitely formed, and in many cases as
brilliantly coloured, as those which live in the sunlight along the
shallow shores.</p>
<p>Now, my dear friends,&mdash;surely beautiful things were made to
be seen by some one, else why were they made beautiful?&nbsp; Common
sense tells us that.&nbsp; But who has seen those countless tribes,
which have been living down, in utter darkness, since the making of
the world?&nbsp; Common sense, I think, can give but one answer&mdash;GOD.&nbsp;
He, and He only, to whom the night is as clear as the day, to whom the
darkness and the light are both alike.&nbsp; But more&mdash;God has
not only made things beautiful; He has made things happy; whatever misery
there may be in the world, there is no denying that.&nbsp; However sorrow
may have come into the world, there is a great deal more happiness than
misery in it.&nbsp; Misery is the exception; happiness is the rule.&nbsp;
No rational man ever heard a bird sing, without feeling that that bird
was happy; and, if so, his common sense ought to tell him that if God
made that bird, He made it to be happy; He intended it to be happy,
and He takes pleasure in its happiness, though no human ear should ever
hear its song, no human heart should ever share in its joy.&nbsp; Yes,
the world was not made for man; but man, like all the world, was made
for God.&nbsp; Not for man&rsquo;s pleasure merely, not for man&rsquo;s
use, but for God&rsquo;s pleasure all things are, and for God&rsquo;s
pleasure they were created.</p>
<p>And now, surely, common sense will tell us why God made all things.&nbsp;
For His own pleasure.&nbsp; God is pleased to make them, and pleased
with what He has made, because what He has made is worth being pleased
with.&nbsp; He has seen all things that He has made, and, behold, they
are very good, and right, and wise, and beautiful, and happy, each after
its kind.&nbsp; So that, as the Psalmist says, &ldquo;The Lord shall
rejoice in His works.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Scripture tells that it must
be so, if we only recollect and believe one word of St. John&rsquo;s
that &ldquo;God is Love&rdquo;&mdash;for it is the very essence of love,
that it cannot be content to love itself.&nbsp; It must have something
which is not itself to love that it may go out of itself, and forget
itself, and spend itself in the good and in the happiness of what it
loves.&nbsp; All true love of husband and wife, mother and child, sister
and brother, friend and friend, man to his country,&mdash;what does
it mean but this?&nbsp; Forgetting one&rsquo;s selfish happiness in
doing good to others, and finding a deeper, higher happiness in that.&nbsp;
The man who only loves himself knows not what Love means.&nbsp; In truth,
he does not even love himself.&nbsp; He is his own worst enemy: his
selfishness torments him with discontent, disgust, pride, fear, and
all evil passions and lusts; and in him is fulfilled our Lord&rsquo;s
saying, that he that will save his life shall lose it.&nbsp; But the
man who is full of love, as God is full of love, who forgets himself
in making others happy, who lives the eternal life of God, which is
alone worth living, he is the only truly happy man; and in him is fulfilled
that other saying of our Lord, that he who loseth his life shall save
it.</p>
<p>And the loving, unselfish man too is the only sound theologian, for
he who dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.&nbsp; He alone
will understand the mystery of who God is, and why He made all things.&nbsp;
The loving man alone, I say, will understand the mystery&mdash;how because
God is love He could not live alone in the abyss, but must create all
things, all worlds and heavens, yea, and the heaven of heavens, that
He might have something beside Himself, whereon to spend His boundless
love.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Because love can only love what is somewhat
like itself, He made all things according to the idea of His own eternal
mind.&nbsp; Because He is unchangeable, and a God of order and of law,
He made all things according to one order, and gave them a law which
cannot be broken, that they might continue this day as they were at
the beginning, serving Him and fulfilling His word.&nbsp; Because He
is a God of justice, He made all things just, depending on each other,
helping each other, and compelled to sacrifice themselves for each other,
and minister to each other whether they will or not.&nbsp; Because He
is a God of beauty, He made all things beautiful, of a variety and a
richness unspeakable, that He might rejoice in all His works, and find
a divine delight in every moss which grows upon the moor, and every
gnat which dances in the sun.&nbsp; Because He is a God of love, He
gave to every creature a power of happiness according to its kind, that
He might rejoice in the happiness of His creatures.&nbsp; And lastly,
because God is a spirit&mdash;a moral and a rational Being&mdash;therefore
He created rational beings to be more like Him than any other creatures,
and constituted the services of men and angels in a most wonderful order,
that they might reverence law as He does, and justice as He does&mdash;that
they might love to be loving as He loves, and to be useful as He is
useful&mdash;that they might rejoice in the beauty of His works as He
rejoices in them Himself; and, catching from time to time fuller and
fuller glimpses of that Divine and wonderful order according to which
He has made all things and all worlds, may see more and more clearly,
as the years roll on, that all things are just, and beautiful, and good;
and join more and more heartily in the hymn which goes up for ever from
every sun, and star, and world, and from the tiniest creature in these
worlds: &ldquo;Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour
and power; for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they
are and were created.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, to God the Father, who, out of His boundless love, ordains the
making of all things; and to God the Son, who, out of His boundless
love, performs the making of all things; and to God the Holy Spirit,
who, out of His boundless love, breathes law and kind, life and growth
into all things, three Persons in one, ever-blessed Trinity, be all
glory, and honour, and praise, for ever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON XVI.&nbsp; THE GLORY OF THE TRINITY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, 1868.&nbsp; <i>St Mary&rsquo;s Chester</i>, 1871.&nbsp;
<i>Trinity Sunday.</i></p>
<p>Psalm civ. 31, 33.&nbsp; &ldquo;The glory of the Lord shall endure
for ever: The Lord shall rejoice in his works.&nbsp; I will sing unto
the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have
my being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is Trinity Sunday, on which we think especially of the name
of God.&nbsp; A day which, to a wise man, may well be one of the most
solemn, and the most humiliating days of the whole year.&nbsp; For is
it not humiliating to look stedfastly, even for a moment, at God&rsquo;s
greatness, and then at our own littleness; at God&rsquo;s strength and
at our own weakness; at God&rsquo;s wisdom, and at our own ignorance;
and, most of all, at God&rsquo;s righteousness, and at our own sins?</p>
<p>I do not say that it should not be so.&nbsp; Rather, I say, it should
be so.&nbsp; For what is more wholesome for you and me, and any man,
than to be humiliated&mdash;humbled&mdash;and brought to our own level&mdash;that
all may see who, what, and where we are?&nbsp; What more wholesome than
to be made holy and humble men of heart?&nbsp; What more wholesome for
us, who are each of us tempted to behave as if we were the centre of
the universe, to judge ourselves the most important personages in the
world, and to judge of everything according as it is pleasant or unpleasant
to us, each in our own family, our own sect, our own neighbourhood;
what more wholesome than to be brought now and then face to face with
God Himself, and see what poor, little, contemptible atoms we are at
best, compared with Him who made heaven and earth?&mdash;to see how
well God and God&rsquo;s world have gone on for thousands of years without
our help;&mdash;how well they will go on after we are dead and gone?</p>
<p>Face to face with God!&nbsp; And how far shall we have to go to find
ourselves face to face with God?&nbsp; Not very far, according to St
Paul.&nbsp; God, he says, is &ldquo;not far from every one of us; for
in Him we live, and move, and have our being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In God, in the ever blessed Trinity&mdash;Father, Son, and Holy Ghost&mdash;we,
and not we only, but every living thing&mdash;each flower, each insect&mdash;lives,
and moves, and has its being.&nbsp; So it is&mdash;strange as it may
seem, and we cannot make it otherwise.&nbsp; You fancy God far off&mdash;somewhere
in the skies, beyond suns and stars.&nbsp; Know that the heavens, and
the heaven of heavens, cannot contain Him.&nbsp; Rather, in the very
deepest sense, He contains them.&nbsp; In God, suns and stars, and all
the host of heaven, live, and move, and have their being; and if God
destroyed them all at this very moment, and the whole universe became
nothing once more, as it was nothing at first, still God would remain,
neither greater nor less, neither stronger nor weaker, neither richer
nor poorer, than He was before.&nbsp; For He is the self-existent I
Am; who needs nought save Himself, and who needs nought save to assert
Himself in His Word, Jesus Christ our Lord, and say &ldquo;I Am,&rdquo;
in order to create all things and beings, save Himself.&nbsp; He is
the infinite; whom nothing, however huge, and vast, or strong, can comprehend&mdash;that
is, take in and limit.&nbsp; He takes in and limits all things; giving
to each thing, form according to its own kind, and life and growth according
to its own law; appointing to all (as says St Paul) their times, and
the bounds of their habitation; that if they be rational creatures,
as we are, they may feel after the Lord and find Him; and if they be
irrational creatures, like the animals and the plants, mountains and
streams, clouds and tempests, sun and stars, they may serve God&rsquo;s
gracious purposes in the economy of His world.</p>
<p>Therefore, everything which you see, is, as it were, a thought of
God&rsquo;s, an action of God&rsquo;s; a message to you from God.&nbsp;
Therefore you can look at nothing in the earth without seeing God Himself
at work thereon.&nbsp; As our Lord said, &ldquo;My Father worketh hitherto,
and I work.&rdquo;&nbsp; You can look neither at the sun in the sky,
nor at the grass beneath your feet, without being brought face to face
with God, the ever blessed Trinity.&nbsp; The tiniest gnat which dances
in the sun, was conceived by God the Father, in whose eternal bosom
are the ideas and patterns of all things, past, present, and to come;
it was created by God the Son, by whom the Father made all things, and
without whom nothing is made: and it is kept alive by God the Holy Spirit,
the Lord and giver of life, of whom it is written, &ldquo;Thou sendest
forth thy Spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh that we could all remember this.&nbsp; That when we walk across
the field, or look out into the garden, we could have the wisdom to
remember, Whither, O God, can I go from Thy presence?&nbsp; For Thou
art looking down on the opening of every bud and flower, and without
Thee not a sparrow falls to the ground.&nbsp; Whither can I flee from
Thy Spirit?&nbsp; For Thy Spirit is giving life perpetually, alike to
me and to the insect at my feet; without Thy Spirit my lungs could not
breathe one breath, my heart could not beat one pulse.&nbsp; In Thee,
I and all things live, move, and have our being.&nbsp; And shall I forget
Thee, disobey Thee, neglect to praise, and honour, and worship Thee,
and thank Thee day and night, for Thy great glory?</p>
<p>If we could but remember that, there would be no fear of our being
ungodly, irreligious, undevout.&nbsp; We look too often, day after day,
month after month, on the world around us just as the dumb beasts do,
as a place out of which we can get something to eat, and forget that
it is also a place out of which we can get, daily and hourly, something
to admire, to adore, to worship, even the thought of God&rsquo;s wisdom,
God&rsquo;s power, God&rsquo;s goodness, God&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; Oh
blind and heedless that we are.&nbsp; Truly said the wise man&mdash;&ldquo;An
undevout astronomer is mad.&rdquo;&nbsp; And truly said another wise
man, an Englishman&mdash;the saintly philosopher Faraday, now with God,&mdash;&ldquo;How
could he be otherwise than religious; when at every step he found himself
brought more closely face to face with the signs of a mind constructed
like his own, with an aim and a purpose which he could understand, employing
ways and means, and tending clearly to an end, and methodically following
out a system which he could both perceive and grasp.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such
a man&rsquo;s whole life is one act of reverence to that God in whose
inner presence he finds himself illuminated and strengthened; and if
there be revelation of divine things on earth, it is when the hidden
secrets of nature are disclosed to the sincere and self-denying seeker
after truth.</p>
<p>Yes, that is true.&nbsp; The more you look into the world around
you, and consider every flower, and bird, and stone, the more you will
see that a Mind planned them, even the mind of God; a Mind like yours
and mine; but how infinitely different, how much deeper, wiser, vaster.&nbsp;
Before that thought we shrink into the nothingness from whence He called
us out at first.&nbsp; The difference between our minds and the Mind
of God is&mdash;to what shall I liken it?&nbsp; Say, to the difference
between a flake of soot and a mountain of pure diamond.&nbsp; That soot
and that diamond are actually the same substance; of that there is no
doubt whatsoever; but as the light, dirty, almost useless soot is to
the pure, and clear, hard diamond, ay, to a mountain, a world, a whole
universe made of pure diamond&mdash;if such a thing were possible&mdash;so
is the mind of man compared with that Mind of the ever blessed Trinity,
which made the worlds, and sustains them in life and order to this day.</p>
<p>My friends, it is not in great things only, but in the very smallest,
that the greatest glory of the ever blessed Trinity is seen.&nbsp; Ay,
most, perhaps, in the smallest, when one considers the utterly inconceivable
wisdom, which can make the smallest animal&mdash;so made as to be almost
invisible under the strongest microscope&mdash;as perfect in all its
organs as the hugest elephant.&nbsp; Ay, more, which can not only make
these tiny living things, but, more wonderful still, make them make
themselves?&nbsp; For what is growth, but a thing making itself?&nbsp;
What is the seed growing into a plant, the plant into a flower, the
flower to a seed again, but that thing making itself, transforming itself,
by an inward law of life which God&rsquo;s Spirit gives it.&nbsp; I
tell you the more earnestly and carefully you examine into the creation,
birth, growth of any living thing, even of the daisy on the grass outside;
the more you inquire what it really is, how it came to be like what
it is, how it got where it is, and so forth; you will be led away into
questions which may well make you dizzy with thinking, so strange, so
vast, so truly miraculous is the history of every organised creature
upon earth.&nbsp; And when you recollect (as you are bound to do on
this day), that each of these things is the work of the ever blessed
Trinity; that upon every flower and every insect, generation after generation
of them, since the world was made, the ever blessed Trinity has been
at work, God the Father thinking and conceiving each thing, in His eternal
Mind, God the Son creating it and putting it into the world, each thing
according to the law of its life, God the Holy Ghost inspiring it with
life and law, that it may grow and thrive after its kind&mdash;when
such thoughts as these crowd upon you, and they ought to crowd upon
you, this day of all the year, at sight of the meanest insect under
your feet; then what can a rational man do, but bow his head and worship
in awful silence, adoring humbly Him who sits upon the throne of the
universe, and who says to us in all His works, even as He said to Job
of old, &ldquo;Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?&nbsp;
When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted
for joy?&nbsp; Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast
thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?&nbsp; Knowest thou the ordinances
of heaven?&nbsp; Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance
of waters may cover thee?&nbsp; Canst thou send lightnings, that they
may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?&nbsp; Wilt thou hunt the prey
for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions?&nbsp; Gavest
thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto
the ostrich?&nbsp; Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed
his neck with thunder?&nbsp; Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom? doth the
eagle mount up at thy command?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When God speaks thus to us&mdash;and He does thus speak to us, by
every cloud and shower, and by every lightning flash and ray of sunshine,
and by every living thing which flies in air, or swims in water, or
creeps upon the earth&mdash;what can we say, save what Job said&mdash;&ldquo;Behold,
I am vile; what shall I answer thee?&nbsp; I will lay mine hand upon
my mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if God be so awful in the material world, of which our five senses
tell us, how much more awful is He in that spiritual and moral world,
of which our senses tell us nought?&nbsp; That unseen world of justice
and truthfulness, of honour and duty, of reverence and loyalty, of love
and charity, of purity and self-sacrifice; that spiritual world, I say,
which can be only seen by the spiritual eye of the soul, and felt by
the spiritual heart of the soul?&nbsp; How awful is God in that eternal
world of right and wrong; wherein cherubim, seraphim, angel and archangel
cry to Him for ever, not merely Mighty, mighty, mighty, but &ldquo;Holy,
holy, holy.&rdquo;&nbsp; How awful to poor creatures like us.&nbsp;
For then comes in the question&mdash;not merely is God good? but, am
not I bad?&nbsp; Is God sinless? but, am not I a sinner?&nbsp; Is God
pure? but am not I impure?&nbsp; Is God wise? then am not I a fool?&nbsp;
And when once that thought has crossed our minds, must we not tremble,
must we not say with Isaiah of old, &ldquo;Woe is me! for I am undone;
because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people
of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes; awful as is the thought of God&rsquo;s perfection in the material
world about us, more awful still is the thought of His perfection in
the spiritual world.&nbsp; So awful, that we might well be overwhelmed
with dread and horror at the sight of God&rsquo;s righteousness and
our sinfulness; were it not for the gracious message of revelation that
tells us, that God, the Father of heaven, is <i>our</i> Father likewise,
who so loved us that He gave for us His only begotten, God the Son;
that for His sake our sins might be freely forgiven us; that God the
Son is our Atonement, our Redeemer, our King, our Intercessor, our Example,
our Saviour in life and death; and God the Holy Ghost, our Comforter,
our Guide, our Inspirer, who will give to our souls the eternal life
which will never perish, even as He gives to our bodies the mortal life
which must perish.</p>
<p>On the mercy and the love of the ever blessed Trinity, shown forth
in Christ upon His cross, we can cast ourselves with all our sins; we
can cry to Him, and not in vain, for forgiveness and for sanctification;
for a clean heart and a right spirit; and that we may become holy and
humble men of heart.&nbsp; We can join our feeble praises to that hymn
of praise which goes up for ever to God from suns and stars, clouds
and showers, beasts and birds, and every living thing, giving Him thanks
for ever for His great glory.&nbsp; O all ye works of the Lord, bless
ye the Lord; praise Him and magnify Him for ever.&nbsp; O ye holy and
humble Men of heart, bless ye the Lord; praise Him and magnify Him for
ever.</p>

<h2>SERMON XVII.&nbsp; LOVE OF GOD AND MAN</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>FIRST SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY.</p>
<p><i>Eversley.&nbsp; Chester Cathedral</i>, 1872.</p>
<p>1 John iv. 16, 21.&nbsp; &ldquo;God is love; and he that dwelleth
in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. . . .&nbsp; And this commandment
have we from Him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the first Sunday after Trinity.&nbsp; On it the Church begins
to teach us morals,&mdash;that is, how to live a good life; and therefore
she begins by teaching us the foundation of all morals,&mdash;which
is love,&mdash;love to God and love to man.</p>
<p>But which is to come first,&mdash;love to God, or love to man?</p>
<p>On this point men in different ages have differed, and will differ
to the end.&nbsp; One party has said, You must love God first, and let
love to man come after as it can; and others have contradicted that
and said, You must love all mankind, and let love to God take its chance.&nbsp;
But St John says, neither of the two is before or after the other; you
cannot truly love God without loving man, or love man without loving
God.&nbsp; St John says so, being full of the Spirit of God: but alas!
men, who are not full of the Spirit of God, but only let themselves
be taught by Him now and then and here and there, have found it very
difficult to understand St John, and still more difficult to obey him;
and therefore there always have been in God&rsquo;s Church these two
parties; one saying, You must love God first, and the other, You must
love your neighbour first,&mdash;and each, of course, quoting Scripture
to prove that they are in the right.</p>
<p>The great leader of the first party&mdash;perhaps the founder of
it, as far as I am aware&mdash;was the famous St Augustine.&nbsp; He
first taught Christians that they ought to love God with the same passionate
affection with which they love husband or wife, mother or child; and
to use towards God the same words of affection which those who love
really utter one to each other.&nbsp; I will not say much of that; still
less will I mention any of the words which good men and women who are
of that way of thinking use towards God.&nbsp; I should be sorry to
hold up such language to blame, even if I do not agree with it; and
still more sorry to hold it up to ridicule from vulgar-minded persons
if there be any in this Church.&nbsp; All I say is, that all which has
been written since about this passionate and rapturous love toward God
by the old monks and nuns, and by the Protestant Pietists, both English
and foreign, is all in St Augustine better said than it ever has been
since.&nbsp; Some of the Pietist hymns, as we know, are very beautiful;
but there are things in them which one wishes left out; which seem,
or ought to seem, irreverent when used toward God; which hurt, or ought
to hurt, our plain, cool, honest English common-sense.&nbsp; A true
Englishman does not like to say more than he feels; and the more he
feels, the more he likes to keep it to himself, instead of parading
it and talking of it before men.&nbsp; Still waters run deep, he holds;
and he is right for himself; only he must not judge others, or think
that because he cannot speak to God in such passionate language as St
Augustine, who was an African, a southern man, with much stronger feelings
than we Englishmen usually have, that therefore St Augustine, or those
who copy him now, do not really feel what they say.&nbsp; But, nevertheless,
plain common-sense people, such as most Englishmen are, are afraid of
this enthusiastical religion.&nbsp; They say, We do not pretend to feel
this rapturous love to God, how much-soever we may reverence Him, and
wish to keep His commandments; and we do not desire to feel it.&nbsp;
For we see that people who have talked in this way about God have been
almost always monks and nuns; or brain-sick, disappointed persons, who
have no natural and wholesome bent for their affections.&nbsp; And even
though this kind of religion may be very well for them, it is not the
religion for a plain honest man who has a wife and family and his bread
to earn in the world, and has children to provide for, and his duty
to do in the State as well as in the Church.&nbsp; And more, they say,
these enthusiastic, rapturous feelings do not seem to make people better,
and more charitable, and more loving.&nbsp; Some really good and charitable
people say that they have these feelings, but for all that we can see
they would be just as good and charitable without the feelings, while
most persons who take up with this sort of religion are not the better
for it.&nbsp; They do not control their tempers; they can be full,&mdash;as
they say,&mdash;of love and devotion to God one minute, but why are
they the next minute peevish, proud, self-willed, harsh and cruel to
those who differ from them?&nbsp; Their religion does not make them
love their neighbours.&nbsp; In old times (when persecution was allowed),
it made them, or at least allowed them, to persecute, torment, and kill
their neighbours, and fancy that by such conduct they did God service;
and now it tempts them to despise their neighbours&mdash;to look on
every one who has not these strange, intense feelings which they say
they have, as unconverted, and lost, and doomed to everlasting destruction.&nbsp;
Not, says the plain man, that we are more satisfied with the mere philanthropist
of modern times,&mdash;the man who professes to love the whole human
race without loving God, or indeed often believing that there is a God
to love.&nbsp; To us he seems as unloving a person as the mere fanatic.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, plain people say, we will have nothing to do with either
fanaticism or philanthropy,&mdash;we will try to do our duty where God
has put us, and to behave justly and charitably by our neighbours; but
beyond that we cannot go.&nbsp; We will not pretend to what we do not
feel.</p>
<p>My friends, there is, as usual, truth on both sides,&mdash;both are
partly right, and both are partly wrong.&nbsp; And both may go on arguing
against each other, and quoting texts of Scripture against each other
till the last day; if they will not listen to St John&rsquo;s message
in the text.&nbsp; One party will say, It is written, Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and soul, and strength, and mind;
and if thou doest that, and thy soul is filled with love for the Creator,
thou canst have no love left for the creature; or if thy heart is filled
with love for the creature, there is no room left for love to God.&nbsp;
And then thou wilt find that God is a jealous God, and will take from
thee what thou lovest, because He will not have His honour given to
another.</p>
<p>And to that the other party will answer, Has not God said, &ldquo;Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself?&rdquo;&nbsp; Has He not commanded
us to love our wives, our children?&nbsp; And even if He had not, would
not common sense tell us that He intended us to do so?&nbsp; Do you
think that God is a tempter and a deceiver?&nbsp; He has given us feelings
and powers.&nbsp; Has He not meant us to use them?&nbsp; He has given
us wife and child.&nbsp; Did He mean us not to love them, after He has
made us love them, we know not how or why?&nbsp; You say that God is
a jealous God.&nbsp; Yes, jealous He may be of our worshipping false
gods, and idols, saints, or anything or person save Himself,&mdash;jealous
of our doing wrong, and ruining ourselves, and wandering out of the
path of His commandments, in which alone is life; but jealous of our
loving our fellow creature as well as Himself, never.&nbsp; That sort
of jealousy is a base and wicked passion in man, and dare we attribute
it to God?&nbsp; What a thing to say of the loving God, that He takes
away people&rsquo;s children, husbands, and friends, because they love
them too much!</p>
<p>Then the first party will say, But is it not written, &ldquo;Love
not the world, neither the things that are in the world.&nbsp; If any
man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And to that, the second party will answer, And do you say that we are
not to love this fair and wonderful earth which God has made for our
use, and put us into it?&nbsp; Why did He make it lovely?&nbsp; Why
did He put us into it, if He did not mean us to enjoy it?&nbsp; That
is contrary to common sense, and contrary to the whole teaching of the
Old Testament.&nbsp; But if by the world you mean the world of man,
the society in which we live&mdash;dare you compare a Christian and
civilized country like England with that detestable Roman world, sunk
in all abominable vices, against which St John and St Paul prophesied?&nbsp;
Are not such thoughts unjust and uncharitable to your neighbours, to
your country, to all mankind?&nbsp; Then the first party will say, But
you do away with all devoutness; and the second party will answer, And
you do away with all morality, for you tell people that the only way
to please God is to feel about Him in a way which not one person in
a thousand can feel; and therefore what will come, and does come, of
your binding heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and laying them
on men&rsquo;s shoulders is this,&mdash;that the generality of people
will care nothing about being good or doing right, because you teach
them that it will not please God, and will leave all religion to a few
who have these peculiar fancies and feelings.</p>
<p>And so they may argue on for ever, unless they will take honestly
the plain words of St John, and see that to love their neighbour is
to love God, and to love God is to love their neighbour.&nbsp; So says
St John clearly enough twice over.&nbsp; &ldquo;God is love; and he
that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The two things are one, and the one cannot be without the other.</p>
<p>Does this seem strange to you?&nbsp; Oh, my friends, it need not
seem strange, if you will but consider who God is, and who man is.&nbsp;
Thou lovest God?&nbsp; Then, if thou lovest Him, thou must needs love
all that He has made.&nbsp; And what has He made?&nbsp; All things,
except sin; and what sin is He has told thee.&nbsp; He has given thee
ten commandments, and let no man give thee an eleventh commandment out
of his own conceit and will worship; calling unclean what God hath made
clean, and cursing what God hath blessed.&nbsp; Thou lovest God?&nbsp;
Then thou lovest all that is good; for God is good, and from Him all
good things come.&nbsp; But what is good?&nbsp; All is good except sin;
for it is written, &ldquo;God saw every thing that He had made, and,
behold, it was very good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore, if thou lovest God,
thou must love all things, for all things are of Him, and by Him, and
through Him; and in Him all live and move and have their being.&nbsp;
Then thou wilt truly love God.&nbsp; Thou wilt be content with God;
and so thy love will cast out fear.&nbsp; Thou wilt trust God; thou
wilt have the mind of God; thou wilt be satisfied with God&rsquo;s working,
from the rise and fall of great nations to the life and death of the
smallest gnat which dances in the sun; thou wilt say for ever, and concerning
all things, I know in whom I have believed.&nbsp; It is the good Lord,
let Him do what seemeth Him good.</p>
<p>Again.&nbsp; Thou lovest thy neighbour; thou lovest wife and child;
thou lovest thy friends; thou lovest or wishest to love all men, and
to do them good.&nbsp; Then thou lovest God.&nbsp; For what is it that
thou lovest in thy neighbour?&nbsp; Not that which is bad in him?&nbsp;
No, but that which is good.&nbsp; Thou lovest him for his kindliness,
his honesty, his helpfulness,&mdash;for some good quality in him.&nbsp;
But from whom does that good come, save from Christ and from the Spirit
of Christ, from whom alone come all good gifts?&nbsp; Yes, if you will
receive it;&mdash;when we love our neighbours, it is God in them, Christ
in them, whom we love,&mdash;Christ in them, the hope of glory.</p>
<p>What, some one will ask, when a man loves a fair face, does he love
Christ then?&nbsp; Ah! my friends, that is not true love, as all know
well enough if they will let their own hearts tell them truth.&nbsp;
True love is when two people love each other for the goodness which
is in them.&nbsp; True love is the love which endures after beauty has
faded, and youth, and health, and all that seems to make life worth
having is gone.&nbsp; Have we not seen ere now two old people, worn,
crippled, diseased, yet living on together, helping each other, nursing
each other, tottering on hand in hand to the grave, dying, perhaps,
almost together,&mdash;because neither cared to live when the other
is gone before, and loving all the while as truly and tenderly as in
the days of youth?&nbsp; They know not why.&nbsp; No; but God knows
why.&nbsp; It is Christ in each other whom they love;&mdash;Christ,
the hope of glory.&nbsp; Yes, we have seen that, surely; and seen in
it one of the most beautiful, the most divine sights upon earth,&mdash;one
which should teach us, if we will look at it aright, that when we love
our neighbour truly, it is the divine part in him, the spark of eternal
goodness in him,&mdash;what St Paul says is Christ in him,&mdash;which
we admire, and cling to, and love.</p>
<p>But by that rule we cannot love every one, for every one is not good.&nbsp;
Be not too sure of that.&nbsp; All are not good, alas! but in all there
is some good.&nbsp; It may be a very little,&mdash;a hope of glory in
them, even though that hope be very faint.&nbsp; It may be dying out;
it may die altogether, and their souls may become utterly base and evil,
and be lost for ever.&nbsp; Still, while there is life there is hope,
even for the worst; and just as far as our hearts are full of the Spirit
of God, we shall see the Spirit of God striving with the souls even
of the worst men, and love them for that.&nbsp; Just as far as we have
the likeness of Christ in us, we shall be quick to catch the least gleam
of His likeness in our neighbours, and love them for that.&nbsp; Just
as far as our hearts are full of love we shall see something worth loving
in every human being we meet, and love them for that.&nbsp; I know it
is difficult.&nbsp; It is not gotten in a day, that wide and deep spirit
of love to all mankind which St Paul had; which made him weep with those
who wept and rejoice with those who rejoiced, and become all things
to all men, if by any means he might save some.&nbsp; Before our eyes
are cleansed and purged to see some trace of good in every man, our
hearts must be cleansed and purged from all selfishness, and bigotry,
and pride, and fancifulness, and anger, so that they may be filled with
the loving Spirit of God.&nbsp; As long as a taint of selfishness or
pride remains in us, we shall be in continual danger of hating those
whom God does not hate, despising those whom God does not despise, and
condemning those whom God does not condemn.&nbsp; But if self is cast
out of us, and the Spirit of God and of Christ enthroned in our hearts,
then we shall love our brother, and in loving him love God, who made
him; and so, dwelling in love, we shall dwell in God, and God in us:&mdash;to
which true and only everlasting life may He of His mercy bring us, either
in this world or in the world to come.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON XVIII.&nbsp; COURAGE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Chester Cathedral</i>, 1871.</p>
<p>Acts iv. 13, 18-20.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now when they saw the boldness of
Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant
men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had
been with Jesus. . . .&nbsp; And they called them, and commanded them
not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.&nbsp; But Peter
and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight
of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.&nbsp; For we
cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last Thursday was St Peter&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp; The congregation on
that day was, as far as I could perceive, no larger than usual; and
this is not a matter of surprise.&nbsp; Since we gave up at the Reformation
the superstitious practice of praying to the saints, saints&rsquo; days
have sunk&mdash;and indeed sunk too much&mdash;into neglect.&nbsp; For
most men&rsquo;s religion has a touch of self-interest in it; and therefore
when people discovered that they could get nothing out of St Peter or
St John by praying to them, they began to forget the very memory, many
of them, of St Peter, St John, and other saints and apostles.&nbsp;
They forget, too often, still, that though praying to any saint, or
angel, or other created being, is contrary both to reason and to Scripture;
yet it is according to reason and to Scripture to commemorate them.&nbsp;
That is to remember them, to study their characters, and to thank God
for them&mdash;both for the virtues which He bestowed on them, and the
example which He has given us in them.</p>
<p>For these old saints lived and died for our example.&nbsp; They are,
next of course to the Lord Himself, the ideals, the patterns, of Christian
life&mdash;the primeval heroes of our holy faith.&nbsp; They shew to
us of what stuff the early Christians were made; what sort of stone&mdash;to
use St Paul&rsquo;s own figure,&mdash;the Lord chose wherewith to build
up His Church.&nbsp; They are our spiritual ancestors, for they spread
the Gospel into all lands; and they spread it, remember always, not
only by preaching what they knew, but by being what they were.&nbsp;
Their characters, their personal histories, are as important to us as
their writings; nay, in the case of St Peter, even more important.&nbsp;
For if these two epistles of his had been lost, and never handed down
to us, St Peter himself would have remained, as he is drawn in the Gospels
and the Acts, a grand and colossal human figure, every line and feature
of which is full of meaning and full of teaching to us.</p>
<p>Now I think that the quality&mdash;the grace of God&mdash;which St
Peter&rsquo;s character and story specially force on our notice, is,
the true courage which comes by faith.&nbsp; I say, the courage which
comes by faith.&nbsp; There is a courage which does not come by faith.&nbsp;
There is brute courage, which comes from hardness of heart, from stupidity,
obstinacy, or anger, which does not see danger, or does not feel pain.&nbsp;
That is the courage of the brute.&nbsp; One does not blame it, or call
it wrong.&nbsp; It is good in its place, as all natural things are,
which God has made.&nbsp; It is good enough for the brutes, but it is
not good enough for man.&nbsp; You cannot trust it in man.&nbsp; And
the more a man is what a man should be, the less he can trust it.&nbsp;
The more mind and understanding a man has, so as to be able to foresee
danger, and measure it, the more chance there is of his brute courage
giving way.&nbsp; The more feeling a man has, the more keenly he feels
pain of body, or pain of mind, such as shame, loneliness, the dislike,
ridicule, and contempt of his fellow men; in a word, the more of a man
he is, and the less of a mere brute, the more chance there is of his
brute courage breaking down, just when he wants it most to keep him
up, by leaving him to play the coward and come to shame.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;
To go through with a difficult and dangerous undertaking, a man wants
more than brute courage.&nbsp; He wants spiritual courage&mdash;the
courage which comes by faith.&nbsp; He needs to have faith in what he
is doing; to be certain that he is doing his duty, to be certain that
he is in the right.&nbsp; Certain that right will conquer, certain that
God will make it conquer, by him or by some one else; certain that he
will either conquer honourably, or fail honourably, for God is with
him.&nbsp; In a word, to have true courage, man needs faith in God.</p>
<p>To give one example.&nbsp; Look at the class of men who, in all England,
undergo the most fearful dangers; who know not at what hour of any night
they may not be called up to the most serious labour and responsibility,
with the chance of a horrible and torturing death.&nbsp; I mean the
firemen of our great cities, than whom there are no steadier, braver,
nobler-hearted men.&nbsp; Not a week passes without one or more of these
firemen, in trying to save life and property, doing things which are
altogether heroic.&nbsp; What do you fancy keeps them up to their work?&nbsp;
High pay?&nbsp; The amusement and excitement of fires?&nbsp; The vanity
of being praised for their courage?&nbsp; My friends, those would be
but paltry weak motives, which would not keep a man&rsquo;s heart calm
and his head clear under such responsibility and danger as theirs.&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; It is the sense of duty,&mdash;the knowledge that they are
doing a good and a noble work in saving the lives of human beings and
the wealth of the nation,&mdash;the knowledge that they are in God&rsquo;s
hands, and that no real evil can happen to him who is doing right,&mdash;that
to him even death at his post is not a loss, but a gain.&nbsp; In short,
faith in God, more or less clear, is what gives those men their strong
and quiet courage.&nbsp; God grant that you and I, if ever we have dangerous
work to do, may get true courage from the same fountain of ghostly strength.</p>
<p>Now, St Peter&rsquo;s history is, I think, a special example of this.&nbsp;
He was naturally, it seems, a daring man,&mdash;a man of great brute
courage.&nbsp; So far so good; but he had to be taught, by severe lessons,
that his brute courage was not enough,&mdash;that he wanted spiritual
courage, the courage which came by faith, and that if that failed him,
the brute courage would fail too.</p>
<p>He throws himself into the lake, to walk upon the water to Christ;
and as soon as he is afraid he begins to sink.&nbsp; The Lord saves
him, and tells him why he had sank.&nbsp; Because he had doubted, his
faith had failed him.&nbsp; So he found out the weakness of courage
without faith.&nbsp; Then, again, he tells our Lord, &ldquo;Though all
men shall be offended of Thee, yet will I never be offended.&nbsp; I
am ready to go with Thee both into prison, and to death.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And shortly after, his mere animal courage breaks out again, and does
what little it can do, and little enough.&nbsp; He draws sword, single-handed,
on the soldiers in the garden, and cuts down a servant of the high priest&rsquo;s,
and perhaps would have flung his life away, desperately and uselessly,
had not our Lord restrained him.&nbsp; But when the fit of excitement
is past, his animal courage deserts him, and his moral courage too,
and he denies his Lord.&nbsp; So he found out that he was like too many,&mdash;full
of bodily courage, perhaps, but morally weak.&nbsp; He had to undergo
a great change.&nbsp; He had to be converted by the Holy Spirit of God,
and strengthened by that Spirit, to have a boldness which no worldly
courage can give.&nbsp; Then, when he was strong himself, he was able
to strengthen his brethren.&nbsp; Then he was able, ignorant and unlearned
man as he was, to stand up before the high priests and rulers of his
nation, and to say, simply and firmly, without boasting, without defiance,
&ldquo;Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more
than unto God, judge ye.&nbsp; For we cannot but speak the things which
we have seen and heard.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, my friends, it is the courage
which comes by faith which makes truly brave men,&mdash;men like St
Peter and St John.&nbsp; He who can say, I am right, can say likewise,
God is on my side, and I will not fear what man can do to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not fear,&rdquo; said the Psalmist, &ldquo;though
the earth be removed, and though the hills be carried into the midst
of the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The just man, who holds firm to his
purpose,&rdquo; says a wise old heathen, &ldquo;he will not be shaken
from his solid mind by the rage of the mob bidding him do base things
or the frowns of the tyrant who persecutes him.&nbsp; Though the world
were to crumble to pieces round him, its ruins would strike him without
making him tremble.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whether it be right,&rdquo;
said Peter and John to the great men and judges of the Jews, &ldquo;to
hearken to God more than to you, judge ye.&nbsp; We cannot but speak
the things which we have seen and heard.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cannot but
speak what we know to be true.</p>
<p>It was that courage which enabled our forefathers,&mdash;and not
the great men among them, not the rich, not even the learned, save a
few valiant bishops and clergy, but for the most part poor, unlearned,
labouring men and women,&mdash;to throw off the yoke of Popery, and
say, &ldquo;Reason and Scripture tell us that it is absurd and wrong
to worship images and pray to saints,&mdash;tell us that your doctrines
are not true.&nbsp; And we will say so in spite of the Pope and all
his power,&mdash;in spite of torture and a fiery death.&nbsp; We cannot
palter; we cannot dissemble; we cannot shelter ourselves under half-truths,
and make a covenant with lies. &lsquo;Whether it be right in the sight
of God to hearken unto you more than to God, judge ye.&nbsp; We cannot
but speak the things which we know to be true.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it has been in all ages, and so it will be for ever.&nbsp; Faith,
the certainty that a man is right, will give him a courage which will
enable him to resist, if need be, the rich ones, the strong ones, the
learned ones of the earth.&nbsp; It has made poor unlearned men heroes
and deliverers of their countrymen from slavery and ignorance.&nbsp;
It has made weak women martyrs and saints.&nbsp; It has enabled men
who made great discoveries to face unbelief, ridicule, neglect, poverty;
knowing that their worth would be acknowledged at last, their names
honoured at last as benefactors by the very men who laughed at them
and reviled them.&nbsp; It has made men, shut up in prison for long
weary years for doing what was right and saying what was true, endure
manfully for the sake of some good cause, and say,&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Stone walls do not a prison make,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor
iron bars a cage;<br />Minds innocent and quiet take<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
for an hermitage.<br />If I have freedom in my thought,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
in my love am free,<br />Angels alone, that soar above,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy
such liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Yes; settle it in your hearts, all of you.&nbsp; There is but one
thing which you have to fear in earth or heaven,&mdash;being untrue
to your better selves, and therefore untrue to God.&nbsp; If you will
not do the thing you know to be right, and say the thing you know to
be true, then indeed you are weak.&nbsp; You are a coward, and sin against
God, and suffer the penalty of your cowardice.&nbsp; You desert God,
and therefore you cannot expect Him to stand by you.</p>
<p>But if you will do the thing you know to be right, and say the thing
you know to be true, then what can harm you?&nbsp; Who will harm you,
asks St Peter himself, &ldquo;if you be followers of that which is good?&nbsp;
For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are open
to their prayers.&nbsp; But if ye suffer for righteousness&rsquo; sake,
happy are ye; and be not afraid of those who try to terrify you, neither
be troubled, but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts.&nbsp; Remember
that He is just and holy, and a rewarder of all who diligently seek
Him.&nbsp; Worship Him in your hearts, and all will be well.&nbsp; For
says David again, &ldquo;Lord, who shall dwell in Thy tabernacle, or
who shall rest upon Thy holy hill?&nbsp; Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt
life, and doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh the truth from
his heart.&nbsp; Whoso doeth these things shall never fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, my friends; there is a tabernacle of God in which, even in this
life, He will hide us from the strife of tongues.&nbsp; There is a hill
of God on which, even in the midst of labour and anxiety, we may rest
both day and night.&nbsp; Even Jesus Christ, the Rock of Ages,&mdash;He
who is the Righteousness itself, the Truth itself; and whosoever does
righteousness and speaks truth dwells in Christ in this life, as well
as in the life to come; and Christ will strengthen him by His Holy Spirit
to stand in the evil day, if it shall come, and having done all, to
stand.&nbsp; My dear friends, if any of you are minded to be good men
and women, pray for the Holy Spirit of God.&nbsp; First for the spirit
of love to give you good desires; then the spirit of faith, to make
you believe deeply in the living God, who rewards every man according
to his work; and then for the spirit of strength, to enable you to bring
these desires to good effect.</p>
<p>Pray for that spirit, I say; for we all need help.&nbsp; There are
too many people in the world&mdash;too many, perhaps, among us here&mdash;who
are not what they ought to be, and what they really wish to be, because
they are weak.&nbsp; They see what is right, and admire it; but they
have not courage or determination to do it.&nbsp; Most sad and pitiable
it is to see how much weakness of heart there is in the world&mdash;how
little true moral courage.&nbsp; I suppose that the reason is, that
there is so little faith; that people do not believe heartily and deeply
enough in the absolute necessity of doing right and being honest.&nbsp;
They do not believe heartily and deeply enough in God to trust Him to
defend and reward them, if they will but be true to Him, and to themselves.&nbsp;
And therefore they have no moral courage.&nbsp; They are weak.&nbsp;
They are kind, perhaps, and easy; easily led right; but, alas! just
as easily led wrong.&nbsp; Their good resolutions are not carried out;
their right doctrines not acted up to; and they live pitiful, confused,
useless, inconsistent lives; talking about religion, and yet denying
the power of religion in their daily lives; playing with holy and noble
thoughts and feelings, without giving themselves up to them in earnest,
to be led by the Spirit of God, to do all the good works which God has
prepared for them to walk in.&nbsp; Pray all of you, then, for the spirit
of faith, to believe really in God; and for the spirit of ghostly strength,
to obey God honestly.&nbsp; No man ever asked earnestly for that spirit
but what he gained it at last.&nbsp; And no man ever gained it but what
he found the truth of St Peter&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;Who will harm
you if ye be followers of that which is good?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON XIX.&nbsp; GOOD DAYS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, 1867.&nbsp; <i>Westminster</i>, <i>Sept</i>. 27,
1872.</p>
<p>1 Peter iii. 8-12.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be ye all of one mind, having compassion
one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: Not rendering
evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing
that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.&nbsp;
For he that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue
from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: Let him eschew evil,
and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.&nbsp; For the eyes of
the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are open unto their prayers:
but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is one of the texts which is apt to puzzle people who do not
read their Bibles carefully enough.&nbsp; They cannot see what the latter
part of it has to do with the former.</p>
<p>St. Peter says that we Christians are called that we should inherit
a blessing.&nbsp; That means, of course, they say, the blessing of salvation,
everlasting life in heaven.&nbsp; But then St. Peter quotes from the
34th Psalm.&nbsp; &ldquo;For he that will love life, and see good days,
let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no
guile.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now that Psalm, they say, speaks of blessing and
happiness in this life.&nbsp; Then why does St. Peter give it as a reason
for expecting blessing and happiness in the life to come?&nbsp; And
then, they say, to make it fit in, it must be understood spiritually;
and what they mean by that, I do not clearly know.</p>
<p>Their notion is, that the promises of the Old Testament are more
or less carnal, because they speak of God&rsquo;s rewarding men in this
life; and that the promises of the New Testament are spiritual, because
they speak of God&rsquo;s rewarding men in the next life; and what they
mean by that, again, I do not clearly know.</p>
<p>For is not the Old Testament spiritual as well as the New?&nbsp;
I trust so, my friends.&nbsp; Is not the Old Testament inspired, and
that by the Spirit of God? and if it be inspired by the Spirit, what
can it be but spiritual?&nbsp; Therefore, if we want to find the spiritual
meaning of Old Testament promises, we need not to alter them to suit
any fancies of our own; like those monks of the fourth and succeeding
centuries, who saw no sanctity in family or national life; no sanctity
in the natural world, and, therefore, were forced to travesty the Hebrew
historians, psalmists, and prophets, with all their simple, healthy
objective humanity, and politics, and poetry, into metaphorical and
subjective, or, as they miscalled them, spiritual meanings, to make
the Old Testament mean anything at all.&nbsp; No; if we have any real
reverence for the Holy Scriptures, we must take them word for word in
their plain meaning, and find the message of God&rsquo;s Spirit in that
plain meaning, instead of trying to put it in for ourselves.&nbsp; Therefore
it is that the VII. Article bids us beware of playing with Scripture
in this way.&nbsp; It says the Old Testament is not contrary to the
New, for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered
to mankind by Christ.&nbsp; Wherefore they are not to be heard who feign
that the old fathers did look only for transitory promises, that is
temporary promises, promises which would be fulfilled only in this life,
and end and pass away when they died.</p>
<p>But some one will say, how can that be, when so many of the old Hebrews
seem to have known nothing about the next life?&nbsp; Moses, for instance,
always promises the Children of Israel that if they do right, and obey
God, they shall be rewarded in this life, with peace and prosperity,
fruitfulness and wealth; but of their being rewarded in the next life
he never says one word&mdash;which last statement is undeniably true.</p>
<p>Is not then the Old Testament contrary to the New, if the Old Testament
teaches men to look for their reward in this life, and the New Testament
in the next?&nbsp; No, it is not, my friends.&nbsp; And I think we shall
see that it is not, and why it is not, if we will look honestly at this
very important text.&nbsp; If we do that we shall see that what St.
Peter meant&mdash;what the VII.&nbsp; Article means is the only meaning
which will make sense of either one or the other; is simply this&mdash;that
what causes a man to enjoy this life, is the same that will cause him
to enjoy the life to come.&nbsp; That what will bring a blessing on
him in this life, will bring a blessing on him in the life to come.&nbsp;
That what blessed the old Jews, will bless us Christians.&nbsp; That
if we refrain our tongue from evil, and our lips from speaking deceit;
it we avoid evil and do good; if we seek peace and follow earnestly
after it; then shall we enjoy life, and see good days, and inherit a
blessing; whether in this life or in the life to come.</p>
<p>And why?&nbsp; Because then we shall be living the one and only everlasting
life of goodness, which alone brings blessings; alone gives good days;
and is the only life worth living, whether in earth or heaven.</p>
<p>My dear friends, lay this seriously to heart, in these days especially,
when people and preachers alike have taken to part earth and heaven,
in a fashion which we never find in Holy Scripture.&nbsp; Lay it to
heart, I say, and believe that what is right, and therefore good, for
the next life, is right, and therefore good, for this.&nbsp; That the
next life is not contrary to this life.&nbsp; That the same moral laws
hold good in heaven, as on earth.&nbsp; Mark this well; for it must
be so, if morality, that is right and goodness, is of the eternal and
immutable essence of God.&nbsp; And therefore, mark this well again,
there is but one true, real, and right life for rational beings, one
only life worth living, and worth living in this world or in any other
life, past, present, or to come.&nbsp; And that is the eternal life
which was before all worlds, and will be after all are passed away&mdash;and
that is neither more nor less than a good life; a life of good feelings,
good thoughts, good words, good deeds, the life of Christ and of God.</p>
<p>It is needful, I say, to bear this in mind just now.&nbsp; People
are, as I told you, too apt to say that the Old Testament saints got
their rewards in this life, while we shall get them in the next.&nbsp;
Do they find that in Scripture?&nbsp; If they will read their Bible
they will find that the Old Testament saints were men whom God was training
and educating, as He does us, by experience and by suffering.&nbsp;
That David, so far from having his reward at once in this life, had
his bitter sorrows and trials; that Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Job, all,
indeed, of the old prophets, had to be made perfect by suffering, and
(as St. Paul says) died in faith <i>not</i> having received the promises.&nbsp;
So that if they had their reward in this life, it must have been a spiritual
reward, the reward of a good conscience, and of the favour of Almighty
God.&nbsp; And that is no transitory or passing reward, but enduring
as immortality itself.&nbsp; But people do not usually care for that
spiritual reward.&nbsp; Their notion of reward and happiness is that
they are to have all sorts of pleasures, they know not what, and know
not really why.&nbsp; And because they cannot get pleasant things enough
to satisfy them in this life, they look forward greedily to getting
them in the next life; and meanwhile are discontented with God&rsquo;s
Providence, and talk of God&rsquo;s good world as if some fiend and
not the Lord Jesus Christ was the maker and ruler thereof.&nbsp; Do
not misunderstand me.&nbsp; I am no optimist.&nbsp; I know well that
things happen in this world which must, which ought to make us sad&mdash;so
sad that at moments we envy the dead, who are gone home to their rest;
real tragedies, real griefs, divine and Christlike griefs, which only
loving hearts know&mdash;the suffering of those we love, the loss of
those we love, and, last and worst, the sin of those we love.&nbsp;
Ah! if any of those swords have pierced the heart of any soul here,
shall I blame that man, that woman, if they cry at times, &ldquo;Father,
take me home, this earth is no place for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shall I bid
them do aught but cling to the feet of Christ and cry, &ldquo;If it
be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will,
but as Thou wilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, not of such do I speak; not of such
sharers of Christ&rsquo;s unselfish suffering here, that they may be
sharers of His unselfish joy hereafter.&nbsp; Not of them do I speak;
but of those who only wish to make up for selfish discomforts and disappointments
in this life by selfish comforts and satisfaction in the next; and who
therefore take up (let me use the honest English word) some maundering
form of religion, which, to judge from their own conduct, they usually
only half believe; those who seem, on six days of the week, as fond
of finery and frivolity as any other gay worldlings, and on the seventh
join eagerly in hymns in which (in one case at least) they inform the
Almighty God of truth, who will not be mocked, that they lie awake at
night, weeping because they cannot die and see &ldquo;Jerusalem the
golden,&rdquo; and so forth.&nbsp; Or those, again, who for six days
in the week are absorbed in making money&mdash;honestly if they can,
no doubt, but still making money, and living luxuriously on their profits&mdash;and
on the seventh listen with satisfaction to preachers and hymns which
tell them that this world is all a howling wilderness, full of snares
and pitfalls; and that in this wretched place the Christian can expect
nothing but tribulation and persecution till he &ldquo;crosses Jordan,
and is landed safe on Canaan&rsquo;s store,&rdquo; and so forth.</p>
<p>My friends, my friends, as long as a man talks so, blaspheming God&rsquo;s
world&mdash;which, when He made it, behold it was all very good&mdash;and
laying the blame of their own ignorance and peevishness on God who made
them, they must expect nothing but tribulation and sorrow.&nbsp; But
the tribulation and the sorrow will be their own fault, and not God&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
If religious professors will not take St. Peter&rsquo;s advice and the
Psalmist&rsquo;s advice; if they will go on coveting and scheming about
money, and how they may get money; if they will go on being neither
pitiful, courteous, nor forgiving, and hating and maligning whether
it be those who differ from them in doctrine, or those who they fancy
have injured them, or those who merely are their rivals in the race
of life; then they are but too likely to find this world a thorny place,
because they themselves raise the thorns; and a disorderly place, because
their own tempers and desires are disorderly; and a wilderness, because
they themselves have run wild, barbarians at heart, however civilised
in dress and outward manners.&nbsp; St. James tells them that of old.&nbsp;
&ldquo;From whence,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;come wars and quarrels among
you?&nbsp; Come they not hence, even of the lusts which war in your
members?&nbsp; You long, and have not.&nbsp; You fight and war, yet
you have not, because you ask not.&nbsp; You ask, and have not.&nbsp;
You pray for this and that, and God does not give it you.&nbsp; Because
you ask amiss, selfishly to consume it on your lusts.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then you say, This world is an evil place, full of temptations.&nbsp;
What says St. James to that?&nbsp; &ldquo;Let no man say when he is
tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither
tempteth He any man.&nbsp; But every man is tempted, when he is drawn
away of his own lust, and enticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was in the Old Testament times, and so it is in these Christian
times.&nbsp; God is good, and God&rsquo;s world is good; and the evil
is not in the world around us, but in our own foolish hearts.&nbsp;
If we follow our own foolish hearts, we shall find this world a bad
place, as the old Jews found it&mdash;whenever they went wrong and sinned
against God&mdash;because we are breaking its laws, and they will punish
us.&nbsp; If we follow the commandments of God, we shall find this world
a good place, as the old Jews found it&mdash;whenever they went right,
and obeyed God&mdash;because we shall be obeying its laws, and they
will reward us.&nbsp; This is God&rsquo;s promise alike to the old Jewish
fathers and to us Christian men.&nbsp; And this is no transitory or
passing promise, but is founded on the eternal and everlasting law of
right, by which God has made all worlds, and which He Himself cannot
alter, for it springs out of His own essence and His own eternal being.&nbsp;
Hear, then, the conclusion of the whole matter: God hath called you
that you might inherit a blessing.</p>
<p>He hath made you of a blessed race, created in His own likeness,
to whom He hath put all things in subjection, making man a little lower
than the angels, that He might crown him with glory and worship: a race
so precious in God&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;we know not why&mdash;that when
mankind had fallen, and seemed ready to perish from their own sin and
ignorance, God spared not His only begotten Son, but freely gave Him
for us, that the world by Him might be saved.&nbsp; And God hath put
you in a blessed place, even His wondrous and fruitful world, which
praises God day and night, fulfilling His word; for it continues this
day as in the beginning, and He has given it a law which cannot be broken.&nbsp;
He has made you citizens of a blessed kingdom, even the kingdom of heaven,
into which you were baptised; and has given you the Holy Bible, that
you might learn the laws of the kingdom, and live for ever, blessing
and blest.</p>
<p>And the Head of this blessed race, the Maker of this blessed world,
the King of this blessed kingdom, is the most blessed of all beings,
Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son, both God and man.&nbsp; He has
washed you freely from your sins in His own blood; He has poured out
on you freely His renewing Spirit.&nbsp; And He asks you to enter into
your inheritance; that you may love your life, and see good days, by
living the blessed life, which is the life of self-sacrifice.&nbsp;
But not such self-sacrifices as too many have fancied who did not believe
that mankind was a blessed race, and this earth a blessed place.&nbsp;
He does not ask you to give up wife, child, property, or any of the
good things of this life.&nbsp; He only asks you to give up that selfishness
which will prevent you enjoying wife, child, or property, or anything
else in earth, or in heaven either.&nbsp; He asks you not to give up
anything which is <i>around</i> you, for that which cometh from without
defileth not a man; but to give up something which is within you, for
that which cometh from within, that defileth a man.</p>
<p>He asks you to give up selfishness and all the evil tempers which
that selfishness breeds.&nbsp; To give up the tongue which speaks evil
of your fellow-men; and the lips which utter deceit; and the brain which
imagines cunning; and the heart which quarrels with your neighbour.&nbsp;
To give these up and to seek peace, and pursue it by all means reasonable
or honourable; peace with all around you, which comes by having first
peace with God; next, peace with your own conscience.&nbsp; This is
the peace which passeth understanding; for if you have it, men will
not be able to understand why you have it.&nbsp; They will see you at
peace when men admire you and praise you, and at peace also when they
insult you and injure you; at peace when you are prosperous and thriving,
and at peace also when you are poor and desolate.&nbsp; And that inward
peace of yours will pass their understanding as it will pass your own
understanding also.&nbsp; You will know that God sends you the peace,
and sends it you the more the more you pray for it: but how He sends
it you will not understand; for it springs out of those inner depths
of your being which are beyond the narrow range of consciousness, and
is spiritual and a mystery, and comes by the inspiration of the holy
Spirit of God.</p>
<p>But remember that all your prayers will not get that peace if your
heart be tainted with malice and selfishness and covetousness, falsehood
and pride and vanity.&nbsp; You must ask God first to root those foul
seeds out of your heart, or the seed of His Spirit will not spring up
and bear fruit in you to the everlasting life of love and peace and
joy in the holy Spirit.&nbsp; But if your heart be purged and cleansed
of self, then indeed will the holy Spirit enter in and dwell there;
and you will abide in peace, through all the chances and changes of
this mortal life, for you will abide in God, who is for ever at peace.&nbsp;
And you will inherit a blessing; for you will inherit Christ, your light
and your life, who is blessed for ever.&nbsp; And you will love life;
for life will be full to you of hope, of work, of duty, of interest,
of lessons without number.&nbsp; And you will see good days; for all
days will seem good to you, even those which seem to the world bad days
of affliction and distress.&nbsp; And so the peace of God will keep
you in Jesus Christ, in this life, and in the life to come.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON XX.&nbsp; GRACE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>. 1856.</p>
<p>St. John i. 16, 17.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of His fulness have all we received,
and grace for grace.&nbsp; For the law was given by Moses, but grace
and truth came by Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wish you to mind particularly this word <i>grace</i>.&nbsp; You
meet it very often in the Bible.&nbsp; You hear often said, The grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.&nbsp; Now, what does this
word grace mean?&nbsp; It is really worth your while to know; for if
a man or a woman has not grace, they will be very unhappy people, and
very disagreeable people also; a torment to themselves, and a torment
to their neighbours also; and if they live without grace, they will
live but a poor life; if they die without grace, they will come to a
very bad end indeed.&nbsp; What, then, does this word mean?&nbsp; Some
of you will answer that grace means God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit, or that
it means what God gives to our souls by His Spirit.&nbsp; But what does
that mean?&nbsp; What does God&rsquo;s Spirit give us?&nbsp; What is
the grace of Jesus Christ like, and how is it the same as the grace
of God&rsquo;s Spirit?</p>
<p>Now, to know what grace means, we must know what St John and St Paul
meant by it, and what the word meant in their time, and what the Ephesians,
and Corinthians, and Romans, to whom they wrote, would have understood
by this word grace.</p>
<p>Now these heathens, to whom the apostles preached, before they heard
the gospel, knew that word grace very well indeed, often used it; and
saw it written up in their heathen temples all about them.&nbsp; And
they meant by it just what we mean, when we talk of a graceful person,
or a graceful tree or flower; and what we mean, too, when we say that
any one is gracious; that they do things gracefully, and have a great
deal of grace in their way of speaking and behaving.&nbsp; We mean by
that that they are handsome, agreeable, amiable, pleasant to look at,
and talk to, and deal with.&nbsp; And so these heathens meant, before
they were Christians.&nbsp; The Romans used to talk about some one called
a Grace.&nbsp; The Greeks called her <i>Charis</i>; which is exactly
the word which St John and St Paul use, and from it come our words charity
and charitable.&nbsp; But more; they used to talk of three Graces: they
fancied that they were goddesses&mdash;spirits of some kind in the shape
of beautiful, and amiable, and innocent maidens, who took delight in
going about the world and making people happy and amiable like themselves;
and they used to make images of these graces, and pray to them to make
them lovely, and happy, and agreeable.&nbsp; And painters and statuaries,
too, used to pray to these graces, and ask them to put beautiful fancies
into their minds, that they might be able to paint beautiful pictures,
and carve beautiful statues.&nbsp; So when St Paul or St John talked
to these heathens about grace, or Charis (as the Testament calls it),
they knew quite well what the apostles meant.</p>
<p>Did the apostles, then, believe in these three goddesses?&nbsp; Heaven
forbid.&nbsp; They came to teach these heathens to turn from those very
vanities, and worship the living-God.&nbsp; And so they told them,&mdash;You
are quite right in thinking that grace comes from heaven, and is God&rsquo;s
gift; that it is God who makes people amiable, cheerful, lovely, and
honourable; that it is God who gives happiness and all the joys of life:
but which god?&nbsp; Not those three maidens; they are but a dream and
fancy.&nbsp; All that is lovely and pleasant in men and women&mdash;and
our life here, and our everlasting life after death, in this world and
in all worlds to come&mdash;all comes from Jesus Christ and from Him
alone.&nbsp; God has gathered together all things in Him, whether things
in heaven or things on earth; and He bestows blessings and graces on
all who will ask Him, to each as much as is good for him.&nbsp; He is
full of grace&mdash;more full of it than all the human beings in the
world put together.&nbsp; All the goodness and sweetness, and all the
graciousness which you ever saw in all the men and women whom you ever
met; all the goodness and sweetness which you ever fancied for yourselves,
all put together is not to be compared to Him.&nbsp; For He is the perfect
brightness of God&rsquo;s glory, and the express image of God&rsquo;s
person; and in Him is gathered together all grace, all goodness, all
which makes men or angels good, and lovely, and loving.&nbsp; All is
in Him, and He gives it freely to all, said the apostles; we know that
He speaks truth, we have seen Him; our eyes saw Him, our hands touched
Him, and there was a glory about Him such as there never could be about
any other person.&nbsp; A glory as of the only begotten of the Father,
full of grace and truth.&nbsp; A person whom we could not help loving;
could not help admiring; could not help trusting; could not help giving
ourselves up to&mdash;to live for Him, and if need be, die for Him.</p>
<p>And, said the apostles, there was a grace of truth in another of
your heathen fancies.&nbsp; You thought that these goddesses, because
they were amiable and innocent themselves, liked to make every one amiable,
innocent, and happy also.&nbsp; Your conscience, your reason were right
there.&nbsp; That is the very nature of grace, not to keep itself to
itself, but to spend itself on every one round it, and try to make every
one like itself.&nbsp; If a man be good, he will long to make others
good; if tender, he will long to make others tender; if gentle, he will
long to make others gentle; if cheerful, he will long to make others
cheerful; if forgiving, he will long to make others forgiving; if happy,
he will long to make others happy.&nbsp; Then said the apostles, only
believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, just because He is full of grace,
wishes to fill you with grace, ten thousand times better grace than
you ever fancied those false goddesses could give you&mdash;of His fulness
you may all receive, and grace for grace.&nbsp; All the grace of this
world comes from Him&mdash;health, and youth, and happiness, and all
the innocent pleasures of life, and He delights in giving you them.&nbsp;
But, over and above that, comes a deeper and nobler grace&mdash;spiritual
grace, the grace of the immortal soul, which will last on, and make
you loving and loveable, pure and true, gracious and generous, honourable
and worthy of respect, when the grace of the body is gone, and the eye
is grown dim, and the hair is grey, and the limbs, feeble; a grace which
will make you gracious in old age, gracious in death, gracious for ever
and ever, after the body has crumbled again to its dust.&nbsp; Whatsoever
things are honourable, lovely, and of good report; whatsoever tempers
of mind make you a comfort to yourselves and all around you; Christ
has them all, and He can give you them all, one after the other, till
Christ be formed in you, till you come to be perfect men and women,
to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.&nbsp; Come,
then, boldly to His throne of grace, to find mercy, and grace to help
you in the time of need.</p>
<p>This was what the apostles taught the heathen, and their words were
true.&nbsp; You may see them come true round you every day.&nbsp; For,
my friends, just as far as people pray for Christ&rsquo;s grace, and
give themselves up to be led by God&rsquo;s Spirit, they become full
of grace themselves, courteous and civil, loving and amiable, true and
honourable&mdash;a pleasure to themselves and to all round them.&nbsp;
While, on the other hand; all rudeness, all ill-temper, all selfishness,
all greediness are just so many sins against the grace of Christ, which
grieve the Spirit of God, at the same time that they grieve our neighbours
for whom Christ died, and cut us off, as long as we give way to them,
from the communion of saints.</p>
<p>Well would it be for married people, if they would but remember this.&nbsp;
Well for them, for their own sake and for their children&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heirs together,&rdquo; St Peter says they are, &ldquo;of the
grace of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Think of those words; for in them lies the
true secret of happiness.&nbsp; Not in the mere grace of youth, which
pleases the fancy at first; that must soon fade; and then comes, too
often, coldness between man and wife; neglect, rudeness, ill-temper,
because the grace of life is not there&mdash;the grace of the inner
life, of the immortal soul, which alone makes life pleasant, even tolerable,
to two people who are bound together for better or for worse.&nbsp;
But yet, unless St Peter be mistaken, the fault in such sad case is
on the man&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Yes, we must face that truth, we men;
and face it like men.&nbsp; If we are unhappy in our marriage it is
our own fault.&nbsp; It is the woman who is the weaker, says St Peter,
and selfish men are apt to say, &ldquo;Then it is the woman&rsquo;s
fault, if we are not happy.&rdquo;&nbsp; St Peter says exactly the opposite.&nbsp;
He says,&mdash;Because she is the weaker you are the stronger; and therefore
it is your fault if she is not what she should be; for you are able
to help her, and lead her; you took her to your heart for that very
purpose, you swore to cherish her.&nbsp; Because she is the weaker,
you can teach her, help her, improve her character, if you will.&nbsp;
You have more knowledge of life and the world than she has.&nbsp; Dwell
with her according to knowledge, says St Peter; use your experience
to set her right if she be wrong; and use your experience and your strength,
too, to keep down your own temper and your own selfishness toward her,
to bear and forbear, to give and forgive, live and let live.&nbsp; Remember
that you are heirs <i>together</i> of the grace of life; and if the
grace of life is not in you, you cannot expect it to be in her.&nbsp;
And what is the grace of life?&nbsp; It must be the grace of Christ.&nbsp;
St John says that Christ <i>is</i> the Life.&nbsp; And what is the grace
of Christ?&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s grace, Christ&rsquo;s gracefulness,
Christ&rsquo;s beautiful and noble and loving character&mdash;the grace
of Christ is Christ&rsquo;s likeness.&nbsp; Do you ask what will Christ
give me?&nbsp; He will give you Himself.&nbsp; He will make you like
Himself, partaker of His grace; and what is that?&nbsp; It is this&mdash;to
be loving, gentle, temperate, courteous, condescending, self-sacrificing.&nbsp;
Giving honour to those who are weaker than yourself, just because they
are weaker; ready and willing, ay, and counting it an honour to take
trouble for other people, to be of use to other people, to give way
to other people; and, above all, to the woman who has given herself
to you, body and soul.&nbsp; That is the grace of Christ; that is the
grace of life; that is what makes life worth having: ay, makes it a
foretaste of heaven upon earth; when man and wife are heirs together
of the grace of life, of all those tempers which make life graceful
and pleasant, giving way to each other in everything which is not wrong;
studying each other&rsquo;s comfort, taking each other&rsquo;s advice,
shutting their eyes to each other&rsquo;s little failings, and correcting
each other&rsquo;s great failings, not by harsh words, but silently
and kindly, by example.&nbsp; And if the man will do that, there is
little fear but that the woman will do it also.&nbsp; And so, their
prayers are not hindered.</p>
<p>Married people cannot pray, they have no heart to pray, while they
are discontented with each other.&nbsp; They feel themselves wrong,
and because they are parted from each other, they feel parted from God
too; and their selfishness or anger rises as a black wall, not merely
between them, but between each of them and God.&nbsp; And so the grace
of life is indeed gone away from them, and the whole world looks dark
and ugly to them, because it is not bright and cheerful in the light
of Christ&rsquo;s grace, which makes all the world full of sunshine
and joy.&nbsp; But it need not be so, friends.&nbsp; It would not be
so, if married people would take the advice which the Prayer Book gives
them, and come to Holy communion.&nbsp; Would to God, my friends, that
all married people would understand what that Holy communion says to
them; and come together Sunday after Sunday to that throne of grace,
there to receive of Christ&rsquo;s fulness, and grace upon grace.&nbsp;
For that Table says to you: You are heirs together of the grace of life;
you are not meant merely to feed together for a few short years, at
the same table, on the bread which perishes, but to feed for ever together
on the bread which comes down from heaven, even on Christ Himself, the
life of the world; to receive life from His life, that you may live
together such a life as He lived, and lives still; to receive grace
from the fulness of His grace, that you may be full of grace as He is.&nbsp;
That Table tells you that because you both must live by the same life
of Christ, you must live the same life as each other, and grow more
and more like each other year by year; that as you both receive the
same grace of Christ, you will become more and more gracious to each
other year by year, and both grow together, nearer and dearer to each
other, more worthy of each other&rsquo;s respect, more worthy of each
other&rsquo;s trust, more worthy of each other&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; And
then &ldquo;till death us do part&rdquo; may mean what it will.&nbsp;
Let death part what of them he can part, the perishing mortal body;
he has no power over the soul, or over the body which shall rise to
life eternal.&nbsp; Let death do his worst.&nbsp; They belong to Christ
who conquered death, and they live by His everlasting life, and their
life is hid with Christ in God, where death cannot reach it or find
it; and therefore their life and their love, and the grace of it, will
last as long as Christ&rsquo;s life and Christ&rsquo;s love, and Christ&rsquo;s
grace last&mdash;and that will be for ever and ever.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXI.&nbsp; FATHER AND CHILD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>. 1861.</p>
<p>1 Cor. i. 4, 5, 7.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thank my God always on your behalf,
for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ.&nbsp; That
in every thing ye are enriched by Him, in all utterance, and in all
knowledge . . .&nbsp; So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Who shall also confirm you
unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This text is a very important one.&nbsp; It ought to teach me how
I should treat you.&nbsp; It ought to teach you how you should treat
your children.&nbsp; It ought to teach you how God, your heavenly Father,
treats you.&nbsp; You see at the first glance how cheerful and hopeful
St Paul is about these Corinthians.&nbsp; He is always thanking God,
he says, about them, for the grace of God which was given them by Jesus
Christ, that in everything they were enriched by Him, in all utterance
and in all knowledge.&nbsp; And he has good hope for them.&nbsp; Nay,
he seems to be certain about them, that they will persevere, and conquer,
and be saved; for Christ Himself will confirm them (that is strengthen
them) to the end, that they may be blameless in the way of our Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>If we knew no more of these Corinthians than what these words tell
us, we should suppose that they were very great saints, leading holy
and irreproachable lives before God and man.&nbsp; But we know that
it was not so.&nbsp; That they were going on very ill.&nbsp; That this
is the beginning of an epistle in which St Paul is going to rebuke them
very severely; and to tell them, that unless they mend, they will surely
become reprobates, and be lost after all.&nbsp; He is going to rebuke
them for having heresies among them, that is religious parties and religious
quarrels&mdash;very much as we have now; for being puffed up with spiritual
self-conceit; for despising and disparaging him; for loose lives, allowing
(in one case) such a crime among them as even the heathen did not allow;
for profaning the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, to such an extent that some seem
even to have got drunk at it; for want of charity to each other; for
indulging in fanatical excitement; for denying, some of them, the resurrection
of the dead; on the whole, for being in so unwholesome a state of mind
that he has to warn them solemnly of the fearful example of the old
Israelites, who perished in the wilderness for their sins&mdash;as they
will perish, he hints, unless they mend.</p>
<p>And yet he begins by thanking God for them, by speaking of them,
and to them, in this cheerful and hopeful tone.</p>
<p>Does that seem strange?&nbsp; Why should it seem strange, my friends,
to us, if we are in the habit of training our children, and rebuking
our children, as we ought?&nbsp; If we have to rebuke our children for
doing wrong, do we begin by trying to break their hearts? by raking
up old offences, by reproaching them with all the wrong they ever did
in their lives, and giving them to understand that they are thoroughly
bad, and have altogether lost our love, so that we will have nothing
more to do with them unless they mend?&nbsp; Or do we begin by making
them feel that however grieved we are with them, we love them still;
that however wrong they have been, there is right feeling left in them
still; and by giving them credit for whatever good there is in them&mdash;by
appealing to that; calling on them to act up to that; to be true to
themselves, and to their better nature; saying, You can do right in
one thing&mdash;then do right in another&mdash;and do right in all?&nbsp;
If we do not do this we do wrong; we destroy our children&rsquo;s self-respect,
we make them despair of improving, we make them fancy themselves bad
children: that is the very surest plan we can take to make them bad
children, by making them reckless.</p>
<p>But if we be wise parents&mdash;such parents to our children as St
Paul was to his spiritual children, the Corinthians&mdash;we shall do
by them just what St Paul did by these Corinthians.&nbsp; Before he
says one harsh word to them, he will awaken in them faith and love.&nbsp;
He will make them trust him and love him, all the more because he knows
that through false teaching they do not trust and love him as they used
to do.&nbsp; But till they do, he knows that there is no use in rebuking
them.&nbsp; Till they trust him and love him, they will not listen to
him.&nbsp; And how does he try to bring them round to him?&nbsp; By
praising them:&mdash;by telling them that he trusts them and loves them,
because in spite of all their faults there is something in them worthy
to be loved and trusted.&nbsp; He begins by giving them credit for whatever
good there is in them.&nbsp; They are rich in all utterance and all
knowledge; that is, they are very brilliant and eloquent talkers about
spiritual things, and also very deep and subtle thinkers about spiritual
things.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; These are great gifts&mdash;gifts
of Christ, too,&mdash;tokens that God&rsquo;s spirit is with them, and
that all they need is to be true to His gracious inspirations.&nbsp;
Then, when he has told them that, or rather made them understand that
he knows that, and is delighted at it, then he can go on safely and
boldly to tell them of their sins also in the plainest and sternest
and yet the most tender and fatherly language.</p>
<p>This is very important, my friends.&nbsp; I cannot tell you fully
how important I think it, in more ways than one.&nbsp; I am sure that
if we took St Paul&rsquo;s method with our children we should succeed
with them far better than we do.&nbsp; And I think, I have thought long,
that if we could see that St Paul&rsquo;s method with those Corinthians
was actually the same as God&rsquo;s method with us, we should have
far truer notions of God, and God&rsquo;s dealings with us; and should
reverence and value far more that Holy Catholic Church into which we
have been, by God&rsquo;s infinite mercy, baptized, and wherein we have
been educated.</p>
<p>For, and now I entreat you to listen to me carefully, you who have
sound heads and earnest hearts, ready and willing to know the truth
about God and yourselves, if St Paul looked at the Corinthians in this
light, may not God have looked at them in the same light?&nbsp; If St
Paul accepted them for the sake of the good which was in them, in spite
of all their faults, may not God have accepted them for the sake of
the good which was in them, in spite of all their faults? and may not
He accept us likewise?&nbsp; I think it must be so.&nbsp; For was not
St Paul an inspired apostle? and are not these words of his inspired
by the Holy Spirit of God?&nbsp; But if so, then the Spirit of God must
have looked at these Corinthians in the same light as St Paul, and therefore
God must do likewise, because the Holy Spirit is God.&nbsp; Must it
not be so?&nbsp; Can we suppose that God would take one view of these
Corinthians, and then inspire St Paul to take another view?&nbsp; What
does being inspired mean at all, save having the mind of Christ and
of God,&mdash;being taught to see men and things as God sees them, to
feel for them and think of them as God does?&nbsp; If inspiration does
not mean that, what does it mean?&nbsp; Therefore, I think, we have
a right to believe that St Paul&rsquo;s words express the mind of God
concerning these Corinthians; that God was pleased with their utterance
and their knowledge, and accepted them for that; and that in the same
way God is pleased with whatsoever He sees good in us, and accepts us
for that.&nbsp; But, remember, not for our own works or deservings any
more than these Corinthians.&nbsp; They were, and we are accepted in
Christ, and for the merits of Christ.&nbsp; And any good points in us,
or in these Corinthians, as St Paul says expressly (here and elsewhere),
are not our own, but come from Christ, by the inspiration of His Holy
Spirit.</p>
<p>I know many people do not think thus.&nbsp; They think of God as
looking only at our faults; as extreme to mark what is done amiss; as
never content with us; as always crying to men, Yes, you have done this
and that well, and yet not quite well, for even in what you have done
there are blots and mistakes; but this and that you have not done, and
therefore you are still guilty, still under infinite displeasure.&nbsp;
And they think that they exalt God&rsquo;s holiness by such thoughts,
and magnify His hatred of sin thereby.&nbsp; And they invent arguments
to prove themselves right, such as this: That because God is an infinite
being, every sin committed against Him is infinite; and therefore deserves
an infinite punishment; which is a juggle of words of which any educated
man ought to be ashamed.</p>
<p>I do not know where, in the Bible, they find all this.&nbsp; Certainly
not in the writings of St Paul.&nbsp; They seem to me to find it, not
in the Bible at all, but in their own hearts, judging that God must
be as hard upon His children as they are apt to be upon their own.&nbsp;
I know that God is never content with us, or with any man.&nbsp; How
can He be?&nbsp; But in what sense is He not content?&nbsp; In the sense
in which a hard task-master is not content with his slave, when he flogs
him cruelly for the slightest fault?&nbsp; Or in the sense in which
a loving father is not content with his child, grieving over him, counselling
him, as long as he sees him, even in the slightest matter, doing less
well than he might do?&nbsp; Think of that, and when you have thought
of it, believe that in this grand text St Paul speaks really by the
Spirit of God, and according to the mind of God, and teaches not these
old Corinthians merely, but you and your children after you, what is
the mind of God concerning you, what is the light in which God looks
upon you.&nbsp; For, if you will but think over your own lives, and
over the Catechism which you learned in your youth, has not God&rsquo;s
way of dealing with you been just the same as St Paul&rsquo;s with those
Corinthians, teaching you to love and trust Him almost before He taught
you the difference between right and wrong?&nbsp; I know that some think
otherwise.&nbsp; Many who do not belong to the Church, and many, alas!
who profess to belong to the Church, will tell you that God&rsquo;s
method is, first to terrify men by the threats of the law and the sight
of their sins and the fear of damnation, and afterwards to reveal to
them the gospel and His mercy and salvation in Christ.&nbsp; Now I can
only answer that it is not so.&nbsp; Not so in fact.&nbsp; These preachers
themselves may do it; but that is no proof that God does it.&nbsp; What
God&rsquo;s plan is can only be known from facts, from experience, from
what actually happens; first in God&rsquo;s kingdom of nature, and next
in God&rsquo;s kingdom of grace, which is the Church.&nbsp; And in the
kingdom of nature how does God begin with mankind?&nbsp; What are a
child&rsquo;s first impressions of this life?&nbsp; Does he hear voices
from heaven telling little children that they are lost sinners?&nbsp;
Does he see lightning come from heaven to strike sinners dead, or earthquakes
rise and swallow them up?&nbsp; Nothing of the kind.&nbsp; A child&rsquo;s
first impressions of this life, what are they but pleasure?&nbsp; His
mother&rsquo;s breast, warmth, light, food, play, flowers, and all pleasant
things,&mdash;by these God educates the child, even of the heathen and
the savage:&mdash;and why?&nbsp; If haply he may feel after God and
find Him, and find that He is a God of love and mercy, a giver of good
things, who knows men&rsquo;s necessities before they ask,&mdash;a good
and loving God, and not a being such as I will not, I dare not speak
of.</p>
<p>I say with the very heathen God deals thus.&nbsp; We have plain Scripture
for that.&nbsp; For we have, and thanks be to God that we have, in such
times as these, a missionary sermon preached by St Paul to the heathen
at Lystra.&nbsp; And in that is not one word concerning these terrors
of the law.&nbsp; He says, I preach to you God, whom you ought to have
known of yourselves, because He has not left Himself without witness.&nbsp;
And what is this witness of which the apostle speaks?&nbsp; Wrath and
terror and destruction?&nbsp; Not so, says St Paul.&nbsp; This is His
witness, that He has sent you rain and fruitful seasons, filling your
heart with food and gladness.&nbsp; His goodness, His bounty,&mdash;it
is the witness of God and of the character of God.&nbsp; There is wrath
and terror enough, says St Paul elsewhere, awaiting those who go on
in sin.&nbsp; But then what does he say is their sin?&nbsp; Despising
the goodness of God, by which He has been trying to win mankind to love
and trust Him, before He threatens and before He punishes at all.&nbsp;
So much for the terrors of the law coming before the good news of the
gospel in God&rsquo;s kingdom of nature.</p>
<p>And still less do the terrors of the law come first in God&rsquo;s
kingdom of grace, which is the Church.&nbsp; They did not come first
to you or to me, or to any one in His Church who has been taught, as
churchmen should be, their Catechism.&nbsp; If any have been, unhappily
for them, brought up to learn Catechisms and hymns which do not belong
to the Church, and which terrify little children with horrible notions
of God&rsquo;s wrath, and the torments prepared not merely for wicked
men, but for unconverted children, and then teach them to say,&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Can such a wretch as I<br />Escape this dreadful end?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>so much the worse for them.&nbsp; We, who are Church people, are
bound to believe that God speaks to us through the Church books, and
that it was His will that we should have been brought up to believe
the Catechism.&nbsp; And in that Catechism we heard not one word of
these terrors of the law or of God&rsquo;s wrath hanging over us.&nbsp;
We were taught that before we even knew right from wrong, God adopted
us freely as His children, freely forgave us our original sin for the
sake of Christ&rsquo;s blood, freely renewed us by His Holy Spirit,
freely placed us in His Church;&mdash;that we might love Him, because
He first loved us; trust Him because He has done all that even God could
do to win our trust; and obey Him, because we are boundlessly in debt
to Him for boundless mercies.&nbsp; This is God&rsquo;s method with
us in His Church, and what is it but St Paul&rsquo;s method with these
Corinthians?</p>
<p>Believe this, then, you who wish to be Churchmen in spirit and in
truth.&nbsp; Believe that St Paul&rsquo;s conduct is to you a type and
pattern of what God does, and what you ought to do.&nbsp; That God&rsquo;s
method of winning you to do right is to make you love Him and trust
Him; and that your method of winning your children to do right is to
make them love and trust you.&nbsp; Let us remember that if our children
are not perfect, they at least inherited their imperfections from us;
and if our Father in heaven, from whom we inherit no sin, but only good,
have patience with us, shall we not have patience with our children,
who owe to us their fallen nature?</p>
<p>Ah! cast thy bread upon the waters,&mdash;the bread which even the
poorest can give to their children abundantly and without stint,&mdash;the
bread of charity,&mdash;human tenderness, forbearance, hopefulness,&mdash;cast
that bread upon the waters, and thou shalt find it after many days.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXII.&nbsp; GOD IS OUR REFUGE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Westminster Abbey</i>, 1873.</p>
<p>Psalm xlvi. 1.&nbsp; &ldquo;God is our refuge and strength, a very
present help in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a noble psalm, full of hope and comfort; and it will be more
and more full of hope and comfort, the more faithfully we believe in
the incarnation, the passion, the resurrection, and the ascension of
our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; For if we are to give credit to His express
words, and to those of every book of the New Testament, and to the opinion
of that Church into which we are baptised, then Jesus Christ is none
other than the same Jehovah, Lord, and God who brought the Jews out
of Egypt, who guided them and governed them through all their history&mdash;teaching,
judging, rewarding, punishing them and all the nations of the earth.&nbsp;
This psalm, therefore, is concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom
all power is given in heaven and earth, and who ascended up on high;
that He might be as He had been from the beginning, King of kings and
Lord of lords, the Master of this world and all the nations in it.&nbsp;
This psalm, therefore, is a hymn concerning the kingdom of Christ and
of God.&nbsp; It tells us something of the government which Christ has
been exercising over the world ever since the beginning of it, and which
He is exercising over this world now.&nbsp; It bids us be still, and
know that He is God&mdash;that He will be exalted among the nations,
and will be exalted in the earth, whether men like it or not; but that
they ought to like it and rejoice in it, and find comfort in the thought
that Christ Jesus is their refuge and their strength&mdash;a very present
help in trouble&mdash;as the old Jew who wrote this psalm found comfort.</p>
<p>When this psalm was written, or what particular events it speaks
of, I cannot tell, for I do not think we have any means of finding out.&nbsp;
It may have been written in the time of David, or of Solomon, or of
Hezekiah.&nbsp; It may possibly have been written much later.&nbsp;
It seems to mo probably to refer&mdash;but I speak with extreme diffidence&mdash;to
that Assyrian invasion, and that preservation of Jerusalem, of which
we heard in the magnificent first lesson for this morning and this afternoon;
when, at the same time that the Assyrians were crushing, one by one,
every nation in the East, there was, as the elder Isaiah and Micah tell
us plainly, a great volcanic outbreak in the Holy Land.&nbsp; But all
this matters very little to us; because events analogous to those of
which it speaks have happened not once only, but many times, and will
happen often again.&nbsp; And this psalm lays down a rule for judging
of such startling and terrible events whenever they happen, and for
saying of them, &ldquo;God is our refuge and strength, a very present
help in trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems from the beginning of the psalm
that there had been earthquakes or hurricanes in Judea&mdash;more probably
earthquakes, which were and are now frequent there.&nbsp; It seems as
if the land had been shaken, and cliffs thrown into the sea, which had
rolled back in a mighty wave, such as only too often accompanies an
earthquake.&nbsp; But the Psalmist knew that that was God&rsquo;s doing;
and therefore he would not fear, though the earth was moved, and though
the hills were earned into the very midst of the sea.&nbsp; It seems,
moreover, that Jerusalem itself had, as in Hezekiah&rsquo;s time, not
been shaken, or at least seriously injured, by the earthquake.&nbsp;
But why?&nbsp; &ldquo;God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she
not be removed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems, also, as if the earthquake or
hurricane had been actually a benefit to Jerusalem&mdash;which was often
then, and has been often since, in want of water&mdash;that either fresh
springs had broken out, or abundant rain had fallen, as occurs at times
in such convulsions of nature.&nbsp; But that, too, was God&rsquo;s
doing on behalf of His chosen city.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rivers of the flood&rdquo;
had made &ldquo;glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacle
of the most highest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, there seem to have been great disturbances and wars among
the nations round.&nbsp; The heathen had made much ado, and the kingdoms
had been moved.&nbsp; But whatever their plans were, it was God who
had brought them to naught.&nbsp; God had shewed His voice, and the
earth melted away; and (we know not how) discomfiture had fallen upon
them, and a general peace had followed.&nbsp; &ldquo;O come hither,&rdquo;
says the Psalmist, &ldquo;and behold the works of the Lord, what desolations
He has made in the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not a desolation of cruelty and
tyranny: but a desolation of mercy and justice; putting down the proud,
the aggressive, the ruthless, and helping the meek, the simple, the
industrious, and the innocent.&nbsp; It is He, says the Psalmist, who
has made wars to cease in all the world, who has broken the bow and
snapped the spear in sunder, and burned the chariots in the fire; and
so, by the voice of fact, said to these kings and to their armies, if
they would but understand it, &ldquo;Be still, and know that I am God&rdquo;&mdash;that
I, not you, will be exalted among the nations&mdash;that I, not you,
will be exalted in the earth.</p>
<p>Such is the 46th Psalm, one of the noblest utterances of the whole
Old Testament.&nbsp; And is it not as true for us now, ay, for all nations
and all mankind now, as it was when it was uttered?&nbsp; Is not Jesus
Christ the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever?&nbsp; Have His words
passed away?&nbsp; Did He say in vain, &ldquo;All power is given unto
me in heaven and earth?&rdquo;&nbsp; Did He say in vain, &ldquo;Lo,
I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
trust not.&nbsp; I trust and I hope that you, or at least some here,
believe that Christ is ruling and guiding the world, the church, and
every individual soul who trusts in Him toward&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;One far off divine event,<br />To which the whole creation
moves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I hope you do have that trust, for your own sakes, for the sake of
your own happiness, your own sound peace of mind; for then, and then
only, you can afford to be hopeful concerning yourselves, your families,
your country, and the whole human race.&nbsp; It must be so.&nbsp; If
you believe that He who hung upon the cross for all mankind is your
refuge and strength, and the refuge and strength of all mankind, then,
amid all the changes and chances of this mortal life, you can afford
to be still calm in sudden calamity, patient in long afflictions; for
you know that He is God, He is the Lord, He is the Redeemer, He is the
King.&nbsp; He knows best.&nbsp; He must be right, whosoever else is
wrong.&nbsp; Let Him do what seemeth Him good.</p>
<p>Now I cannot but feel (what wiser and better men than I am feel more
deeply), that this old-fashioned faith in the living Christ is dying
out among us.&nbsp; That men do not believe as they used to do in the
living Lord and in His government, in that perpetual divine providence
which the Scriptures call &ldquo;the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
have lost faith in Christ&rsquo;s immediate and personal government
of the world and its nations; and, therefore, they are tempted more
and more, either to try to misgovern the world themselves, or to fancy
that Christ has entrusted His government, as to a substitute and vicar,
to an aged priest at Rome.&nbsp; They have lost faith, likewise, in
Christ&rsquo;s immediate government of themselves; their own fortunes,
their own characters, and inmost souls; and, therefore, they are tempted
either to follow no rule or guidance save their own instincts, passions,
fancies; or else, in despair at their own inward anarchy, to commit
the keeping of their souls to directors and confessors, instead of to
Christ Himself, the Lord of the spirits of all flesh.</p>
<p>Yes, the faith which keeps a man ever face to face with God and with
Christ, in the least as well as in the greatest events of life; which
says in prosperity and in adversity, in plenty and scarcity, in joy
and sorrow, in peace and war,&mdash;It is the Lord&rsquo;s doing, it
is the Lord&rsquo;s sending, and therefore we can trust in the Lord&mdash;that
faith is growing, I fear, very rare.&nbsp; That faith was more common,
I think, a generation or two back, in old-fashioned church people than
in any other.&nbsp; It could not help being so; for the good old Prayer-Book
upon which they were brought up is more full of that simple and living
faith in the Lord, from beginning to end, than any other book on earth
except the Bible.&nbsp; It was more common, too, and I suppose always
will be, among the poor than among the rich; for the poor soon find
out how little they have to depend upon except the Lord and His good
providence; while the rich are tempted, and always will be, to depend
upon their own wealth and their own power, to trust in uncertain riches,
and say, &ldquo;Soul, take thine ease, thou hast much goods laid up
for many years.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was more common, too, and I suppose
always will be, among the old than among the young; for the young are
tempted to trust not in the Lord, but in their own health, strength,
wit, courage, and to put their hopes, not on God&rsquo;s Providence,
but on the unknown chapter of accidents in the future, most of which
will never come to pass; while the old have learned by experience and
disappointment the vanity of human riches, the helplessness of human
endeavour, the blindness of human foresight, and are content to go where
God leads them, and say, &ldquo;I will go forth in the strength of the
Lord God, and will make mention of Thy righteousness only.&nbsp; Thou,
O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I tell
of Thy wondrous works.&nbsp; Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age,
when I am grey-headed; until I have showed Thy strength unto this generation,
and Thy power to all them which are yet for to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, for some reason or other, this generation does not seem to care
to see God&rsquo;s strength; and those that are yet for to come seem
likely to believe less and less in God&rsquo;s power&mdash;believe less
and less that they are in Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, and that Christ is
ruling over them and all the world.&nbsp; They have not faith in the
Living Lord.&nbsp; But they must get back that faith, if they wish to
keep that wealth and prosperity after which every one scrambles so greedily
now-a-days; for those who forget God are treading, they and their children
after them, not, as they fancy, the road to riches&mdash;they are treading
the road to ruin.&nbsp; So it always was, so it always will be.&nbsp;
Yet the majority of mankind will not see it, and the preacher must not
expect to be believed when he says it.&nbsp; Nevertheless it is true.&nbsp;
Those who forget that they are in Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, Christ does
not go out of His way to punish them.&nbsp; They simply punish themselves.&nbsp;
They earn their own ruin by the very laws of human nature.&nbsp; They
must find hope in something and strength in something; and if they will
not see that God is their hope, they will hope to get rich as fast as
possible, and make themselves safe so.&nbsp; If they will not see that
God is their strength, they will find strength in cunning, in intrigue,
in flattery of the strong and tyranny over the weak, and in making themselves
strong so.&nbsp; They want a present help in trouble; and if they will
not believe that God is a present help in trouble, they will try to
help themselves out of their trouble by begging, lying, swindling, forging,
and all those meannesses which fill our newspapers with shameful stories
day by day, and which all arise simply out of want of faith in God.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is written, &ldquo;Be still, and know that I am God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And if men will not be still, they will not know that He is God.&nbsp;
And if they do not know that the gracious Christ is God, they will not
be still; and therefore they will grow more and more restless, discontented,
envious, violent, irreverent, full of passions which injure their own
souls, and sap the very foundations of order and society and civilised
life.&nbsp; And what can come out of all these selfish passions, when
they are let loose, but that in which selfishness must always end, but
that same mistrust and anarchy, ending in that same poverty and wretchedness,
under which so many countries of the world now lie, as it were, weltering
in the mire.&nbsp; Alas! say rather weltering in their own life-blood&mdash;and
all because they have forgotten the living God?</p>
<p>Oh, my dear friends, take these words solemnly to heart&mdash;for
yourselves, and for your children after you.&nbsp; If you wish to prosper
on the earth, let God be in all your thoughts.&nbsp; Remember that the
Lord is on your right hand; and then, and then alone, will you not be
moved, either to terror or to sin, by any of the chances and changes
of this mortal life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fret not thyself,&rdquo; says the
Psalmist, &ldquo;else shalt thou be moved to do evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
the only way not to fret yourselves is to remember that God is your
refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
that believeth,&rdquo; saith the Prophet, &ldquo;shall not make haste&rdquo;&mdash;not
hurry himself into folly and disappointment and shame.&nbsp; Why should
you hurry, if you remember that you are in the kingdom of Christ and
of God?&nbsp; You cannot hurry God&rsquo;s Providence, if you would;
you ought not, if you could.&nbsp; God <i>must</i> know best; God&rsquo;s
Laws <i>must</i> work at the right pace, and fulfil His Will in the
right way and at the right time.&nbsp; As for what that Will is, we
can know from the angels&rsquo; song on Christmas Eve, which told us
how God&rsquo;s Will was a good will towards men.</p>
<p>For who is our Lord?&nbsp; Who is our King?&nbsp; Who is our Governor?&nbsp;
Who is our Lawgiver?&nbsp; Who is our Guide?&nbsp; Christ, who died
for us on Calvary; who rose again for us; who ascended into heaven for
us; who sits at God&rsquo;s right hand for us; who sent down His Holy
Spirit at the first Whitsuntide; and sends Him down for ever to us;
that by His gracious inspiration we may both perceive and know what
we ought to do, and also may have grace and power faithfully to fulfil
the same.&nbsp; With such a King over us, how can the world but go right?&nbsp;
With such a King over us, what refuge or strength or help in trouble
do we need but Him Himself?&mdash;His Providence, which is Love, and
His Laws, which are Life.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXIII.&nbsp; PRIDE AND HUMILITY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, 1869.&nbsp; <i>Chester Cathedral</i>, 1870.</p>
<p>1st. Peter v. 5.&nbsp; &ldquo;God resisteth the proud, and giveth
grace to the humble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let me, this evening, say a few words to you on theology, that is,
on the being and character of God.&nbsp; You need not be afraid that
I shall use long or difficult words.&nbsp; Sound theology is simple
enough, and I hope that my words about it will be simple enough for
the worst scholar here to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, this saying is an old one.&nbsp; It had been said, in different
words, centuries before St Peter said it.&nbsp; The old prophets and
psalmists say it again and again.&nbsp; The idea of it runs through
the whole of the Old Testament, as anyone must know who has read his
Bible with common care.&nbsp; But why should it be true?&nbsp; What
reason is there for it?&nbsp; What is there in the character of God
which makes it reasonable, probable, likely to be true?&nbsp; That God
would give grace to the humble, and reward men for bowing down before
His Majesty, seems not so difficult to understand.&nbsp; But why should
God resist the proud?&nbsp; How does a man&rsquo;s being proud injure
God, who is &ldquo;I AM THAT I AM;&rdquo; perfectly self-sufficient,
having neither parts nor passions, who tempteth no man, neither is tempted
of any?&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should God go out of His way, as it were, to
care for such a paltry folly as the pride of an ignorant, weak, short-sighted
creature like man?</p>
<p>Now, let us take care that we do not give a wrong answer to this
question&mdash;an answer which too many have given, in their hearts
and minds, though not perhaps in words, and so have fallen into abject
and cruel superstitions, from which may God keep us, and our children
after us.&nbsp; They have said to themselves, God is proud, and has
a right to be proud: and therefore He chooses no one to be proud but
Himself.&nbsp; Pride in man calls out His pride, and makes Him angry.&nbsp;
They have thought of God as some despotic Sultan of the Indies, who
is surrounded, not by free men, but by slaves; who will have those slaves
at his beck and nod.&nbsp; In one word, they have thought of God as
a tyrant.&nbsp; They have thought of God, and, may God forgive them,
have talked of God as if He were like Nebuchadnezzar of old, who, when
the three young men refused to obey him, was filled with rage and fury,
and cast them into a burning fiery furnace.&nbsp; That is some men&rsquo;s
God&mdash;a God who must be propitiated by crouching and flattery, lest
he should destroy them&mdash;a God who holds all men as his slaves,
and therefore hates pride in them.&nbsp; For what has a slave to do
with pride?</p>
<p>But that is not the God of the Bible, my friends, nor the God of
Nature either, the God who made the world and man.&nbsp; For He is not
a tyrant, but a Father.&nbsp; He wishes men not to be His slaves, but
His children.&nbsp; And if He resists the proud, it is because children
have no right to be proud.&nbsp; If He resists the proud, it is in fatherly
love, because it is bad for them to be proud.&nbsp; Not because the
proud are injuring God, but because they are injuring themselves, does
God resist them, and bring them low, and show them what they are, and
where they are, that they may repent, and be converted, and turned back
into the right way.</p>
<p>Remember always that God is your Father.&nbsp; This question, like
all questions between God and man, is a question between a father and
a child; and if you see it in any other light, and judge it by any other
rule, you see it and judge it wrongly, and learn nothing about it, or
worse than nothing.&nbsp; If God were really angry with, really hated,
the proud man, or any other man, would He need only to resist him? would
He have to wait till the next life to punish him?&nbsp; My dear friends,
if God really hated you or me, do you not suppose that He would simply
destroy us&mdash;get rid of us&mdash;abolish us and annihilate us off
the face of the earth, just as we crush a gnat when it bites us?</p>
<p>That God can do; and more&mdash;He does it now and then.&nbsp; He
will endure with much long suffering vessels of wrath, fitted to destruction:
but a moment sometimes comes when He will endure them no longer, and
He destroys them with the destruction for which they have fitted themselves.&nbsp;
In them is fulfilled the parable of the rich man, who said to himself,
&ldquo;Soul, thou hast much good laid up for many years; take thine
ease, eat, drink, and be merry.&nbsp; But God said unto him, Thou fool,
this night thy soul shall be required of thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for the most part, thanks to the mercy of our Heavenly Father,
we are not destroyed by our pride and for our pride.&nbsp; We are only
chastened, as a father chastens his child.&nbsp; And that we are chastised
for pride, who does not know?&nbsp; What proverb more common, what proverb
more true, than that after pride comes a fall?&nbsp; Do we not know
(if we do not, we shall know sooner or later) that the surest way to
fail in any undertaking is to set about it in self-will and self-conceit;
that the surest way to do a foolish thing, is to fancy that we are going
to do a very wise one; that the surest way to make ourselves ridiculous
in the eyes of our fellow-men, is to assume airs, and boast, shew ourselves
off, and end by shewing off only our own folly?</p>
<p>Why is it so?&nbsp; Why has God so ordered the world and human nature,
that pride punishes itself?&nbsp; Because, I presume, pride is begotten
and born of a lie, and God hates a lie, because all lies lead to ruin,
and this lie of pride above all.&nbsp; It is as it were the root lie
of all lies.&nbsp; The very lie by which, as old tales tell, Satan fell
from heaven, and when he tried to become a god in his own right, found
himself, to his surprise and disappointment, only a devil.&nbsp; For
pride and self-conceit contradict the original constitution of man and
the universe, which is this&mdash;that of God are all things, and in
God are all things, and for God are all things.&nbsp; Man depends on
God.&nbsp; Self tells him that he depends on himself.&nbsp; Man has
nothing but what he receives from God.&nbsp; Self tells him that what
he has is his own, and that he has a right to do with it what he likes.&nbsp;
Man knows nothing but what God teaches him.&nbsp; Self tells him that
he has found out everything for himself, and can say what he thinks
fit without fear of God or man.&nbsp; Therefore the proud, self-willed,
self-conceited man must come to harm, like Malvolio in the famous play,
merely because he is in the blackest night of ignorance.&nbsp; He has
mistaken who he is, what he is, where he is.&nbsp; He is fancying himself,
as many mad men do, the centre of the universe; while God is the centre
of the universe.&nbsp; He is just as certain to come to harm as a man
would be on board a ship, who should fancy that he himself, and not
the ship, was keeping him afloat, and step overboard to walk upon the
sea.&nbsp; We all know what would happen to that man.&nbsp; Let us thank
God our Father that He not only knows what would happen to such men:
but desires to save them from the consequences of their own folly, by
letting them feel the consequences of their own folly.</p>
<p>Oh my friends, let us search our hearts, and pray to our Father in
Heaven to take out of them, by whatever painful means, the poisonous
root of pride, self-conceit, self-will.&nbsp; So only shall we be truly
strong&mdash;truly wise.&nbsp; So only shall we see what and where we
are.</p>
<p>Do we pride ourselves on being something?&nbsp; Shall we pride ourselves
on health and strength?&nbsp; A tile falling off the roof, a little
powder and lead in the hands of a careless child, can blast us out of
this world in a moment&mdash;whither, who can tell?&nbsp; What is our
cleverness&mdash;our strength of mind?&nbsp; A tiny blood vessel bursting
on the brain, will make us in one moment paralytic, helpless, babblers,
and idiots.&nbsp; What is our knowledge of the world?&nbsp; That of
a man, who is forcing his way alone through a thick and pathless wood,
where he has never been before, to a place which he has never seen.&nbsp;
What is our wisdom&mdash;What does a wise man say of his?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;So runs my dream; but what am I?<br />An infant crying in
the night;<br />An infant crying for the light;<br />And with no language
but a cry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Our true knowledge is to know our own ignorance.&nbsp;
Our true strength is to know our own weakness.&nbsp; Our true dignity
is to confess that we have no dignity, and are nobody, and nothing in
ourselves, and to cast ourselves down before the Dignity of God, under
the shadow of whose wings, and in the smile of whose countenance, alone,
is any created being safe.&nbsp; Let us cling to our Father in Heaven,
as a child, walking in the night, clings to his father&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;
Let us take refuge on the lowest step of the throne of Christ our Lord,
and humble ourselves under His mighty hand; and, instead of exalting
ourselves in undue time, leave Him to exalt us again in due time, when
the chastisement has told on us, and patience had her perfect work;
casting all our care on Him, who surely cares for us still, if He cared
for us once, enough to die for us on the cross; caring for God&rsquo;s
opinion and not for the opinion of the world.&nbsp; And then we shall
be among the truly humble, to whom God gives grace&mdash;first grace
in their own hearts, that they may live gracious lives, modest and contented,
dignified and independent, trusting in God and not in man; and then,
grace in the eyes of their fellow-men, for what is more graceful, what
is more gracious, pleasant to see, pleasant to deal with, than the humble
man, the modest man?&nbsp; I do not mean the cringing man, the flattering
man, the man who apes humility for his own ends, because he wants to
climb high, by pretending to be lowly.&nbsp; He is neither graceful
or gracious.&nbsp; He is only contemptible, and he punishes himself.&nbsp;
He spoils his own game.&nbsp; He defeats his own purpose.&nbsp; For
men despise him, and use him, and throw him away when they have done
with him, as they throw away a dirty worn-out tool.</p>
<p>Not him do I mean by the humble man, the modest man.&nbsp; I mean
the man who, like a good soldier, knows his place and keeps it, knows
his duty, and does it; who expects to be treated as a man should be,
with fairness, consideration, respect, kindness&mdash;and God will always
treat him so, whether man does or not: but who, beyond that, does not
trouble his mind with whether he be private or sergeant, lieutenant
or colonel, but with whether he can do his duty as private, his duty
as sergeant, his duty as lieutenant, his duty as colonel; who has learnt
the golden lesson, which so few learn in these struggling, envious,
covetous, ambitious days, namely, to abide in the calling to which he
is called, and in whatsoever state he is, therewith to be content.&nbsp;
To be sure that in God&rsquo;s world, the only safe way to become ruler
over many things is to be a good ruler over a few things; that if he
is fit for better work than he is doing now, God will find that out,
sooner and more surely than he, or any man will, and will set him about
it; and that, meanwhile, God has set him about work which he can do,
and that the true wisdom is to do that and do it well, and so approve
himself alike to man and God, humbling himself under the mighty hand
of God, that He may exalt him in good time, by giving him grace and
strength to do great things, as He has given him grace and strength
to do small things.</p>
<p>Am I speaking almost to deaf ears?&nbsp; I fear that few here will
take my advice.&nbsp; I fear that many here will have excellent excuses
and plain reasons, why they should not take it.&nbsp; Be it so.&nbsp;
They cannot alter eternal fact.&nbsp; In one word, they cannot alter
Theology.&nbsp; They cannot alter the laws of God.&nbsp; They cannot
alter the character of God.&nbsp; And sooner or later, in this world
or in the next, they will find out that Theology is right: and St Peter
is right: that God <i>does</i> resist the proud, that God <i>does</i>
give grace to the humble.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXIV.&nbsp; WORSHIP</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, <i>September</i> 4, 1870.</p>
<p>Revelation xi. 16, 17.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the four and twenty elders,
which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped
God, saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and
wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power,
and hast reigned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dear friends,&mdash;I wish to speak a few plain words to you this
morning, on a matter which has been on my mind ever since I returned
from Chester, namely,&mdash;The duty of the congregation to make the
responses in Church.</p>
<p>Now I am not going to scold&mdash;even to blame.&nbsp; To do so would
be not only unjust, but ungrateful in me, to a congregation which is
as attentive and as reverent as you are.&nbsp; Indeed, I am the only
person to blame, for I ought to have spoken on the subject long ago.</p>
<p>As it is, coming fresh from Chester, and accustomed to hear congregations,
in that city and in the country round, reading the responses aloud throughout
the service with earnestness, and reverence, I was painfully struck
by the silence in this church.&nbsp; I had before grown so accustomed
to it that I did not perceive it, just as one grows accustomed to a
great many things which ought not to be, till one forgets that, however
usual they may be, wrong they are, and ought to be amended.</p>
<p>Now, it is always best to begin at the root of a matter.&nbsp; So
to begin at the root of this.&nbsp; Why do we come to church at all?</p>
<p>Some will say, to hear the sermon.&nbsp; That is often too true.&nbsp;
Some folks do come to church to hear a man get up and preach, just as
they go to a concert to hear a man get up and sing, to amuse and interest
them for half-an-hour.&nbsp; Some go to hear sermons, doubtless, in
order that they may learn from them.&nbsp; But are there not, especially
in these days of cheap printing, books of devotion, tracts, sermons,
printed, which contain better preaching than any which they are likely
to hear in church?&nbsp; If <i>teaching</i> is all that they come to
church for, they can get that in plenty at home.&nbsp; Moreover, nine
people out of ten who come to church need no teaching at all.&nbsp;
They know already, just as well as the preacher, what is right and what
is wrong; they know their duty; they know how to do it.&nbsp; And if
they do not intend to do it, all the talking in the world (as far as
I have seen) will not make them do it.&nbsp; Moreover, if the teaching
in the sermon be what we come to church for, why have we prayer-books
full of prayers, thanksgivings, psalms, and so forth, which are not
sermons at all?&nbsp; What is the use of the service, as we call it,
if the sermon is the only or even the principal object for which we
come?&nbsp; I trust there are many of you here who agree with me so
fully, that you would come regularly to church, as I should, even if
there were no sermon, knowing that God preaches to every man, in the
depths of his own heart and conscience, far more solemn and startling
sermons than any mortal man can utter.</p>
<p>Others will answer that they come to church to say their prayers.&nbsp;
Well: that is a wiser answer than the last.&nbsp; But if that be all,
why can they not say their prayers at home?&nbsp; God is everywhere.&nbsp;
God is all-seeing, all-hearing, about our path and about our bed, and
spying out all our ways.&nbsp; Is He not as ready to hear in the field,
and in the workshop and in the bed-chamber, as in the church?&nbsp;
&ldquo;When thou prayest,&rdquo; says our Lord, &ldquo;enter into thy
closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is
in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Those are not my words, they are the words of our Lord Jesus Christ
Himself; and none can gainsay them.&nbsp; None dare take from them or
add to them; and our coming to church, therefore, must be for more reasons
than for the mere saying of our prayers.</p>
<p>Others will answer&mdash;very many, indeed, will answer&mdash;we
come to church because&mdash;because, we hardly know why, but because
we ought to come to church.</p>
<p>Some may call that a silly answer, only fit for children: but I do
not think so.&nbsp; It seems to me a very rational answer: perhaps a
very reverent and godly answer.&nbsp; A man comes to church for reasons
which he cannot explain to himself: just so&mdash;and many of the deepest
and best feelings of our hearts, are just those that we cannot explain
to ourselves, though we believe in them, would fight for them, die for
them.&nbsp; The man who frankly confesses that he does not quite know
why he comes to church is most likely to know at last why he does come;
most likely to understand the answer which Scripture gives to the question
why we come to church.&nbsp; And what answer is that?&nbsp; Strange
to say, one which people now-a-days, with their Bibles in their hands,
have almost forgotten.&nbsp; We come to church, according to the Bible,
to worship God.</p>
<p>To worship.&nbsp; Think awhile what that ancient and deep and noble
word signifies.&nbsp; So ancient is it, that man learnt to worship even
before he learnt to till the ground.&nbsp; So deep, that even to this
day no man altogether understands what worshipping means.&nbsp; So noble,
that the noblest souls on earth delight most in worshipping; that the
angels, and archangels, and the spirits of just men made perfect, find
no nobler occupation, no higher enjoyment, in the heavenly world than
worshipping for ever Him whose glory fills all earth and heaven.&nbsp;
To worship.&nbsp; That power of worship, that longing to worship, that
instinct that it is his duty to worship something, is&mdash;if you will
receive it&mdash;the true distinction between men and brutes.&nbsp;
Philosophers have tried to define man as this sort of animal and that
sort of animal.&nbsp; The only sound definition is this: man is <i>the</i>
one animal who worships; and he worships, just because he is <i>not</i>
merely an animal, but a man, with an immortal soul within him.&nbsp;
Just in as far as man sinks down again to the level of the brute&mdash;whether
in some savage island of the South Seas, or in some equally savage alley
of our own great cities&mdash;God forgive us that such human brutes
should exist here in Christian England&mdash;just so far he feels no
need to worship.&nbsp; He thinks of no unseen God or powers above him.&nbsp;
He cares for nothing but what his five senses tell him of; he feels
no need to go to church and worship.&nbsp; Just in as far as a man rises
to the true standard of a man; just in as far as his heart and his mind
are truly cultivated, truly developed, just so far does he become more
and more aware of an unseen world about him; more and more aware that
in God he lives and moves and has his being&mdash;and so much the more
he feels the longing and the duty to worship that unseen God on whom
he and the whole universe depend.</p>
<p>I know what seeming exceptions there are to this rule, especially
in these days.&nbsp; But I say that they are only seeming exceptions.&nbsp;
I never knew yet (and I have known many of them) a virtuous and high-minded
unbeliever: but what there was in him the instinct of worshipping&mdash;the
longing to worship&mdash;he knew not what, the spirit of reverence,
which confesses its own ignorance and weakness, and is ready to set
up, like the Athenians of old, an altar&mdash;in the heart at least&mdash;to
the unknown God.</p>
<p>But how to worship Him?&nbsp; The word itself, if we consider what
it means, will tell us that.&nbsp; Worship, without doubt, is the same
word as worth-ship.&nbsp; It signifies the worth of Him whom we worship,
that He is worthy,&mdash;a worthy God, not merely because of what He
has done, but because of what He is worth in Himself.&nbsp; Good, excellent,
and perfect in Himself, and therefore to be admired, praised, reverenced,
adored, worshipped&mdash;even if He had never done a kindness to you
or to any human being.&nbsp; Remember this last truth.&nbsp; For true
it is; and we remember it too little.&nbsp; Of course we know that God
is good; first and mainly by His goodness to us.&nbsp; Because He is
good enough to give us life and breath and all things, we conclude that
He is a good being.&nbsp; Because He is good enough to have not spared
His only begotten Son, but freely given Him for us, when we were still
sinners and rebels, we conclude Him to be the best of all beings, a
being of boundless goodness.&nbsp; But it is because God is so perfectly
and gloriously good in Himself, and not merely because He has done <i>us</i>
kindnesses, yea, heaped us with undeserved benefits, that we are to
worship Him.&nbsp; For His kindnesses we owe Him gratitude, and gratitude
without end.&nbsp; But for His excellent and glorious goodness, we owe
Him worship, and worship without end.</p>
<p>There are some hearts, surely, among you here who know what I mean:
some here who have felt reverence and admiration for some great and
good human being, and who have felt, too, that that reverence and admiration
is one of the most elevating and unselfish of all feelings, and quite
distinct from any gratitude, however just, for favours done; who can
say, in their hearts, of some noble human being: &ldquo;If he never
did me a kindness, never spoke to me, never knew of my existence, I
should honour him and love him just the same, for the noble and good
personage that he is, irrespective of little me, and my paltry wants.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, even such ought to be our feeling toward God, our worship of God.&nbsp;
Even so should we adore Him who alone is worthy of glory, and honour,
and praise, and thanksgiving, because He is good, and beautiful, and
wise Himself, and the cause and source of all goodness, and beauty,
and wisdom, in all created beings, and in the whole universe, past,
present, and to come.&nbsp; Consider, I beseech you, those glimpses
of the Eternal Worship in heaven which St John gives us in the Book
of Revelation&mdash;How he saw the elders fall down before Him who sat
upon the throne, and worship Him that liveth for ever, and cast their
crowns before the throne, saying: &ldquo;Thou art worthy, O Lord, to
receive glory, and honour, and power; for Thou hast created all things,
and for Thy pleasure they are and were created.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consider that&mdash;Those blessed spirits of just men made perfect,
confessing that they are nothing, but that Christ is all; that they
have nothing, but that they owe all to Christ; and declaring Him worthy&mdash;not
merely for any special mercies and kindnesses to themselves, not even
for that crowning mercy of His incarnation, His death, His redemption;
even that seems to have vanished from their minds at the sight of Him
as He is.&nbsp; They glorify Him and worship Him simply for what He
is in Himself, for what He would have been even if&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;He
had never stooped from heaven to live and die on earth&mdash;for what
He is and was and will be through eternity, the Creator and the Ruler,
who has made all things, and for whose pleasure they are and were created.&nbsp;
Consider that one text.&nbsp; The more I consider it, the more awful
and yet most blessed depths of teaching do I find therein: and consider
this text also, another glimpse of the worship which is in heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, singing Alleluia;
salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God;
for true and righteous are His judgments.&rdquo;&nbsp; What the special
judgment was, for which these blessed souls worshipped God, I shall
not argue here.&nbsp; It is enough for us that they worshipped God,
as we should worship Him, because His judgments were righteous and true,
were like Himself, proved Him to be what He was, worthy in Himself,
because He is righteous and true.&nbsp; And consider then, again&mdash;the
text.&nbsp; Before Him, the righteous and true Being who has created
all things for His pleasure, and therefore has made them wisely and
well; before Him who reigns, and will reign till He has put all His
enemies under His foot; before Him, I say, bow down yourselves, and
find true nobleness in confessing your own paltriness, true strength
in confessing your own weakness, true wisdom in confessing your own
ignorance, true holiness in confessing your own sins.</p>
<p>And not alone merely, each in your own chamber, or in your own heart.&nbsp;
That is the place for private confessions of sin, for private prayers
for help; for all the secrets which we dare not, and need not tell to
any human being.&nbsp; They indeed are not out of place here in church.&nbsp;
Those who composed our Prayer Book felt that, and have filled our services,
the Litany especially, with prayers in which each of us can offer up
his own troubles to God, if he but remember that he is offering up to
God his neighbour&rsquo;s troubles also, and the troubles of all mankind.&nbsp;
For this is the reason why we pray together in church; why all men,
in all ages, heathen as well as Christian, have had the instinct of
assembling together for public worship.&nbsp; They may have fancied
often that their deity dwelt in one special spot, and that they must
go thither to find him.&nbsp; They may have fancied that he or she dwelt
in some particular image, and that they must visit, and pray to that
particular image, if they wished their prayers to be heard.&nbsp; All
this, however, have men done in their foolishness; but beneath that
foolishness there have been always more rational ideas, sounder notions.&nbsp;
They felt that it was God who had made them into families, and therefore
whole families met together to worship in common Him of whom every family
in heaven and earth is named.&nbsp; That God had formed them into societies
whether into tribes, as of old, or into parishes, as here now; and therefore
whole parishes came together to worship God, whose laws they were bound
to obey in their parochial society.&nbsp; They felt that it was God
who had made them into Nations (as the psalm says which we repeat every
Sunday morning), and not they themselves; and therefore they conceived
the grand idea of National churches, in which the whole nation should,
if possible, worship Sunday after Sunday, at the same time, and in the
same words, that God to whom they owed their order, their freedom, their
strength, their safety, their National unity and life.&nbsp; And not
in silence merely.&nbsp; These blessed souls in heaven are not silent.&nbsp;
They in heaven follow out the human instinct which they had on earth,
which all men (when they recollect themselves, will have), when they
feel a thing deeply, when they believe a thing strongly, to speak it&mdash;to
speak it aloud.&nbsp; They do not fancy in heaven, as the priests of
Baal did on earth, that they must cry aloud, or God could not hear them.&nbsp;
They do not fancy, as the heathen do, that they must make vain repetitions,
and say the same words over and over again by rote, because they will
be heard for their much speaking; neither need you and I.&nbsp; But
yet they spoke aloud, because out of the fulness of the heart the mouth
speaketh; and so should you and I.</p>
<p>And this brings me to the special object of my sermon.&nbsp; I have
told you what (as it seems to me) Worship means; why we worship; why
we worship together; and why we ought to worship aloud.&nbsp; Believe
me, this last is your duty just as much as mine.&nbsp; The services
of the Church of England are so constructed that the whole congregation
may take part in them, that they may answer aloud in the responses,
that they may say Amen at the end of each prayer, just as they read
or chant aloud the alternate verses of the Psalms.&nbsp; The minister
does not say prayers for them, but with them.&nbsp; He is only their
leader, their guide.&nbsp; And if they are not to join in with their
voices, there is really no reason why he should use his voice, why he
should not say the prayers in silence and to himself, if the congregation
are to say Amen in silence and to themselves.&nbsp; Each person in the
congregation ought to join aloud, first for the sake of his neighbours,
and then for his own sake.</p>
<p>For the sake of his neighbours: for to hear each other&rsquo;s voices
stirs up earnestness, stirs up attention, keeps off laziness, inattention,
and by a wholesome infection, makes all the congregation of one mind,
as they are of one speech, in glorifying God.&nbsp; And for his own
sake, too.&nbsp; For, believe me, when a man utters the responses aloud,
he awakens his own thoughts and his own feelings, too.&nbsp; He speaks
to himself, and he hears himself remind himself of God, and of his duty
to God, and acknowledge himself openly (as in confirmation) bound to
believe and do what he, by his own confession, has assented unto.</p>
<p>Believe me, my dear friends, this is no mere theory.&nbsp; It is
to me a matter of fact and experience.&nbsp; I cannot, I have long found,
keep my attention steady during a service, if I do not make the responses
aloud;&mdash;if I do not join in with my voice, I find my thoughts wandering;
and I am bound to suppose that the case is the same with you.&nbsp;
Do not, therefore, think me impertinent or interfering, if I ask you
all to take your due share in worshipping God in this church with your
voices, as well as with your hearts.&nbsp; Let these services be more
lively, more earnest, more useful to us all than they have been, by
making them more a worship of the whole congregation, and not of the
minister alone.&nbsp; I have read of a great church in the East, in
days long, long ago, in which the responses of the vast congregation
were so unanimous, so loud, that they sounded (says the old writer)
like a clap of thunder.&nbsp; That is too much to expect in our little
country church: but at least, I beg you, take such an open part in the
responses, that you shall all feel that you are really worshipping together
the same God and Christ, with the same heart and mind; and that if a
stranger shall come in, he may say in his heart: Here are people who
are in earnest, who know what they are about, and are not ashamed of
trying to do it; people who evidently mean what they say, and therefore
say what they mean.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXV.&nbsp; THE PEACE OF GOD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Baltimore</i>, <i>U.S</i>., 1874.&nbsp; <i>Westminster Abbey.&nbsp;
November</i> 8, 1874.</p>
<p>Colossians. iii 15.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the peace of God rule in your
hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peace of God.&nbsp; That is what the priest will invoke for you
all, when you leave this abbey.&nbsp; Do you know what it is?&nbsp;
Whether you do or not, let me tell you in a few words, what I seem to
myself to have learned concerning that peace.&nbsp; What it is? how
we can obtain it? and why so many do not obtain it, and are, therefore,
not at peace?</p>
<p>It is worth while to do so.&nbsp; For these are not peaceful times.&nbsp;
The peace of God is rare among us.&nbsp; Some say that it is rarer than
it was.&nbsp; I know not how that may be; but I see all manner of causes
at work around us which should make it rare.&nbsp; We live faster than
our forefathers.&nbsp; We hurry, we bustle, we travel, we are eager
for daily, almost for hourly news from every quarter, as if the world
could not get on without us, or we without knowing a hundred facts which
merely satisfy the curiosity of the moment; and as if the great God
could not take excellent care of us all meanwhile.&nbsp; We are eager,
too, to get money, and get more money still&mdash;piercing ourselves
through too often, as the Apostle warned us&mdash;with many sorrows,
and falling into foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction
and perdition.&nbsp; We are luxurious&mdash;more and more fond of show;
more apt to live up to our incomes, and probably a little beyond; more
and more craving for this or that gew-gaw, especially in dress and ornament,
which if our neighbour has, we must have too, or we shall be mortified,
envious.&nbsp; Nay, so strong is this temper of rivalry, of allowing
no superiors, grown in us, that we have made now-a-days a god of what
used to be considered the basest of all vices&mdash;the vice of envy&mdash;and
dignify it with the names of equality and independence.&nbsp; Men in
this temper of mind cannot be at peace.&nbsp; They are not content;
they cannot be content.</p>
<p>But with what are they not content?&nbsp; That is a question worth
asking.&nbsp; For there is a discontent (as I have told you ere now)
which is noble, manful, heroic, and divine.&nbsp; Just as there is a
discontent which is base, mean, unmanly, earthly&mdash;sometimes devilish.&nbsp;
There is a discontent which is certain, sooner or later, to bring with
it the peace of God.&nbsp; There is a discontent which drives the peace
of God away, for ever and a day.&nbsp; And the noble and peace-bringing
discontent is to be discontented with ourselves, as very few are.&nbsp;
And the mean peace-destroying discontent is to be discontented with
things around us, as too many are.&nbsp; Now, my friends, I cannot see
into your hearts; and I ought not to see.&nbsp; For if I saw, I should
be tempted to judge; and if I judged, I should most certainly judge
rashly, shallowly, and altogether wrong.&nbsp; Therefore examine yourselves,
and judge yourselves in this matter.&nbsp; Ask yourselves each, Am I
at peace?&nbsp; And if not, then apply to yourselves the rule of old
Epictetus, the heroic slave, who, heathen though he was, sought God,
and the peace of God, and found them, doubt it not, long, long ago.&nbsp;
Ask yourselves with Epictetus, Am I discontented with things which are
in my own power, or with things which are not in my own power?&mdash;that
is, discontented with myself, or with things which are not myself?&nbsp;
Am I discontented with myself, or with things about me, and outside
of me?&nbsp; Consider this last question well, if you wish to be true
Christians, true philosophers, and, indeed, true men and women.</p>
<p>But what is it that troubles you?&nbsp; What is it you want altered?&nbsp;
On what have you set your heart and affections?&nbsp; Is it something
outside you?&mdash;something which is <i>not</i> you yourself?&nbsp;
If so, there is no use in tormenting your soul about it; for it is not
in your own power, and you will never alter it to your liking; and more,
you need not alter it, for you are not responsible for it.&nbsp; God
sends it as it is, for better, for worse, and you must make up your
mind to what God sends.&nbsp; Do I mean that we are to submit slavishly
to circumstances, like dumb animals?&nbsp; Heaven forbid.&nbsp; We are
not, like Epictetus, slaves, but free men.&nbsp; And we are made in
God&rsquo;s image, and have each our spark, however dim, of that creative
genius, that power of creating or of altering circumstances, by which
God made all worlds; and to use that, is of our very birthright, or
what would all education, progress, civilisation be, save rebellion
against God?&nbsp; But when we have done our utmost, how little shall
we have done!&nbsp; Canst thou,&mdash;asks our Lord, looking with loving
sadness on the hurry and the struggle of the human anthill&mdash;canst
thou by taking thought add one cubit to thy stature?&nbsp; Why, is there
a wise man or woman in this abbey, past fifty years of age, who does
not know that, in spite of all their toil and struggle, they have gone
not whither they willed, but whither God willed?&nbsp; Have they not
found out that for one circumstance of their lives which they could
alter, there have been twenty which they could not, some born with them,
some forced on them by an overruling Providence, irresistible indeed&mdash;but,
as I hold, most loving and most fatherly, though often severe&mdash;even
to agony&mdash;but irresistible still&mdash;till what they have really
gained by fighting circumstance, however valiantly, has been the <i>moral</i>
gain, the gain in character?&mdash;the power to live the heroic life,
which</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is not as idle ore,<br />But heated hot
with burning fears,<br />And bathed in baths of hissing tears,<br />And
batter&rsquo;d, with the shocks of doom,<br />To shape and use.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Ah! if a man be learning that lesson, which is the primer of eternal
life, then I hardly pity him, though I see him from youth to age tearing
with weak hands at the gates of brass, and beating his soul&rsquo;s
wings to pieces against the bars of the iron cage.&nbsp; But, alas!
the majority of mankind tear at the gates of brass, and beat against
the iron cage, with no such good purpose, and therefore with no such
good result.&nbsp; They fight with circumstances, not that they may
become better themselves, not that they may right the wrongs or elevate
the souls of their fellow-men, not even that they may fulfil the sacred
duty of maintaining, and educating, and providing for the children whom
they have brought into the world, and for whom they are responsible
alike to God and to man; but simply because circumstances are disagreeable
to them; because the things around them do not satisfy their covetousness,
their luxury, their ambition, their vanity.&nbsp; And therefore the
majority of mankind want to be, and to do, and to have a hundred things
which are not in their own power, and of which they have no proof that
God intends to give them; no proof either that if they had them, they
would make right use of them, and certainly no proof at all that if
they had them they would find peace.&nbsp; They war and fight, and have
not, because they ask not.&nbsp; They ask, and have not, because they
ask amiss, to consume it on their lusts; and so they spend their lives
without peace, longing, struggling for things outside them, the greater
part of which they do not get, because the getting them is not in their
own power, and which if they got they could not keep, for they can carry
nothing away with them when they die, neither can their pomp follow
them.&nbsp; And therefore does man walk in a vain shadow, and disquiet
himself in vain, looking for peace where it is not to be found&mdash;in
everything and anything save in his own heart, in duty, and in God.</p>
<p>But happy are they who are discontented with the divine discontent,
discontented with themselves.&nbsp; Happy are they who hunger and thirst
after righteousness, that they may become righteous and good men.&nbsp;
Happy are they who have set their hearts on the one thing which is in
their own power&mdash;being better than they are, and doing better than
they do.&nbsp; Happy are they who long and labour after the true riches,
which neither mobs nor tyrants, man nor devil, prosperity nor adversity,
or any chance or change of mortal life, can take from them&mdash;the
true and eternal wealth, which is the Spirit of God.&nbsp; The man,
I say, who has set his heart on being good, has set his heart on the
one thing which is in his own power; the one thing which depends wholly
and solely on his own will; the one thing which he can have if he chooses,
for it is written, &ldquo;If ye then being evil, know how to give good
gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give
the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover, he has
set his heart on the one thing which cannot be taken from him.&nbsp;
God will not take it from him; and man, and fortune, and misfortune,
cannot take it from him.&nbsp; Poverty, misery, disease, death itself,
cannot make him a worse man, cannot make him less just, less true, less
pure, less charitable, less high-minded, less like Christ, and less
like God.</p>
<p>Therefore he is at peace, for he is, as it were, intrenched in an
impregnable fortress, against all men and all evil influences.&nbsp;
And that castle is his own soul.&nbsp; And the keeper of that castle
is none other than Almighty God, Jesus Christ our Lord, to whose keeping
he has committed his soul, as unto a faithful and merciful Saviour,
able to keep to the uttermost that which is committed to Him in faith
and holiness.</p>
<p>Therefore that man is at peace with himself, for his conscience tells
him that he is, if not doing his best, yet trying to do his best, better
and better day by day.&nbsp; He is at peace with all the world; for
most men are longing and quarrelling for pleasant things outside them,
for which he does not greatly care, while he is longing and striving
for good things inside him in his own heart and soul; and so the world
goes one way, and he another, and their desires do not interfere with
each other.</p>
<p>But, more, that man is at peace with God.&nbsp; He is at peace with
God the Father; for he is behaving as the Father wishes His children
to behave.&nbsp; He is at peace with God the Son; for he is trying to
do that which God the Son did when He came not to do His own will, but
His Father&rsquo;s; not to grasp at anything for himself, but simply
to sacrifice himself for duty, for the good of man.&nbsp; And he is
at peace with God the Holy Spirit; for he is obeying the gracious inspirations
of that Spirit, and growing a better man day by day.&nbsp; And so the
peace of God keeps that man&rsquo;s heart free from vain desires and
angry passions, and his mind from those false and foolish judgments
which make the world think things important which are quite unimportant;
and, again, fancy things unimportant which are more important to them
than the riches of the whole world.</p>
<p>My dear friends, take my words home with you, and if you wish for
the only true and sound peace, which is the peace of God, do your duty.&nbsp;
Try to be as good as you can, each in his station in life.&nbsp; So
help you God.</p>
<p>Take an example from the soldier on the march; and if you do that,
you will all understand what I mean.&nbsp; The bad soldier has no peace,
just because he troubles himself about things outside himself, and not
in his own power.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will the officers lead us right?&rdquo;
That is not in his power.&nbsp; Let him go where the officers lead him,
and do his own duty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will he get food enough, water enough,
care enough, if he is wounded?&rdquo;&nbsp; I hope and trust in God
he will; but that is not in his own power.&nbsp; Let him take that,
too, as it comes, and do his duty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will he be praised,
rewarded, mentioned in the newspapers, if he fights well?&rdquo;&nbsp;
That, too, is not in his own power.&nbsp; Let him take that, too, as
it comes, and do his duty; and so of everything else.&nbsp; If the soldier
on the march torments himself with these matters which are not in his
own power, he is the man who will be troublesome and mutinous in time
of peace, and in time of war will be the first to run away.&nbsp; He
will tell you, &ldquo;A man must have justice done him; a man must see
fair play for himself; a man must think of himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor
fool!&nbsp; He is not thinking of himself all the while, but of a number
of things which are outside him, circumstances which stand round him,
and outside him, and are not himself at all.&nbsp; Because he thinks
of them&mdash;the things outside him&mdash;he is a coward or a mutineer,
while he fancies he is taking care of himself&mdash;as it is written,
&ldquo;Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if the man will really think of himself, of that which is inside
him, of his own character, his own honour, his own duty&mdash;then he
will say, Well fed or ill fed, well led or ill led, praised and covered
with medals, or neglected and forgotten, and dying in a ditch, I, by
myself I, am the same man, and I have the same work to do.&nbsp; I have
to be&mdash;myself, and I have to do&mdash;my duty.&nbsp; So help me
God.&nbsp; And therefore, so help me God, I will be discontented with
no person or thing, save only with myself; and I will be discontented
with myself, not when I have left undone something extraordinary, which
I know I could not have done, but only when I have left undone something
ordinary, some plain duty which I know I could have done, had I asked
God to help me to do it.&nbsp; Then in that soldier would be fulfilled&mdash;has
been fulfilled, thank God, a thousand times, by men who lie in this
abbey, and by men, too, of whom we never heard, &ldquo;whose graves
are scattered far and wide, by mount, by stream, by sea,&rdquo;&mdash;in
him would be fulfilled, I say, the words, &ldquo;He that will lose his
life shall save it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then would he have in his heart, and
in his mind likewise, a peace which victory and safety cannot give,
and which defeat, and wounds, ay, death itself, can never take away.</p>
<p>And are not you, too, soldiers&mdash;soldiers of Jesus Christ?&nbsp;
Then even as that good soldier, you may be at peace, through all the
battles, victories, defeats of mortal life, if you will be discontented
with nothing save yourselves, and vow, in spirit and in truth, the one
oath which is no blasphemy, but an act of faith, and an act of prayer,
and a confession of the true theology&mdash;So help me God.&nbsp; For
then God will help you.&nbsp; Neither you nor I know how; and I am sure
neither you nor I know why&mdash;save that God is utterly good.&nbsp;
God, I say, will help you, by His Holy Spirit the Comforter, to do your
duty, and to be at peace.&nbsp; And then the peace of God will rule
in your hearts and make you kings to God.&nbsp; For He will enable <i>you</i>
each to rule, serene, though weary, over a kingdom&mdash;or, alas! rather
a mob, the most unruly, the most unreasonable, the most unstable, and
often the most fierce, which you are like to meet on earth.&nbsp; To
rule, I say, over a mob, of which you each must needs be king or slave,
according as you choose.&nbsp; And what is that mob?&nbsp; What but
your own faculties, your own emotions, your own passions&mdash;in one
word, your own selves?&nbsp; Yes, with the peace of God ruling in your
hearts, you will be able to become what without it you will never be&mdash;and
that is&mdash;masters of yourselves.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXVI.&nbsp; SINS OF PARENTS VISITED</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>. 19<i>th Sunday after Trinity</i>, 1868.</p>
<p>Ezekiel xviii. 1-4.&nbsp; &ldquo;The word of the Lord came unto me
again, saying, What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the
land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the
children&rsquo;s teeth are set on edge?&nbsp; As I live, saith the Lord
God, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.&nbsp;
Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul
of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a precious chapter, and a comfortable chapter likewise, for
it helps us to clear up a puzzle which has tormented the minds of men
in all ages whenever they have thought of God, and of whether God meant
them well, or meant them ill.</p>
<p>For all men have been tempted.&nbsp; We are tempted at times to say,&mdash;The
fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children&rsquo;s teeth are set
on edge.&nbsp; That is, we are punished not for what we have done wrong,
but for what our fathers did wrong.&nbsp; One man says,&mdash;My forefathers
squandered their money, and I am punished by being poor.&nbsp; Or, my
forefathers ruined their constitutions, and, therefore, I am weakly
and sickly.&nbsp; My forefathers were ignorant and reckless, and, therefore,
I was brought up ignorant, and in all sorts of temptation.&nbsp; And
so men complain of their ill-luck and bad chance, as they call it, till
they complain of God, and say, as the Jews said in Ezekiel&rsquo;s time,
God&rsquo;s ways are unequal&mdash;partial&mdash;unfair.&nbsp; He is
a respecter of persons.&nbsp; He has not the same rule for all men.&nbsp;
He starts men unequally in the race of life&mdash;some heavily weighted
with their father&rsquo;s sins and misfortunes, some helped in every
way by their father&rsquo;s virtue and good fortune&mdash;and then He
expects them all to run alike.&nbsp; God is not just and equal.&nbsp;
And then some go on,&mdash;men who think themselves philosophers, but
are none&mdash;to say things concerning God of which I shall say nothing
here, lest I put into your minds foolish thoughts, which had best be
kept out of them.</p>
<p>But, some of you may say, Is it not so after all?&nbsp; Is it not
true?&nbsp; Is not God harder on some than on others?&nbsp; Does not
God punish men every day for their father&rsquo;s sins?&nbsp; Does He
not say in the Second Commandment that He will do so, and visit the
sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation;
and how can you make that agree with what Ezekiel says,&mdash;&ldquo;The
son shall not bear the iniquity of the father.&rdquo;&nbsp; My dear
friends, I know that this is a puzzle, and always has been one.&nbsp;
Like the old puzzle of God&rsquo;s foreknowledge and our free will,
which seem to contradict each other.&nbsp; Like the puzzle that we must
help ourselves, and yet that God must help us, which seem to contradict
each other.&nbsp; So with this.&nbsp; I believe of it, as of the two
others I just mentioned, that there is no real contradiction between
the two cases; and that some-when, somehow, somewhere, in the world
to come, we shall see them clearly reconciled; and justify God in all
His dealings, and glorify Him in all His ways.&nbsp; But surely already,
here, now, we may see our way somewhat into the depths of this mystery.&nbsp;
For Christ has come to give us light, and in His light we may see light,
even into this dark matter.</p>
<p>For see: God visits the sins of the fathers upon the children unto
the third and fourth generation&mdash;but of whom?&mdash;of them that
hate Him.&nbsp; Now, by those who hate God is meant, those who break
His commandments, and are bad men.&nbsp; If so, then, I say that God
is not only just but merciful, in visiting the sins of the fathers on
the children.</p>
<p>For, consider two cases.&nbsp; Suppose these bad men, from father
to son, and from son to grandson, go on in the same evil ways, and are
incorrigible.&nbsp; Then is not God merciful to the world in punishing
them, even in destroying them out of the world, where they only do harm?&nbsp;
The world does not want fools, it wants wise men.&nbsp; The world does
not want bad men, it wants good men; and we ought to thank God, if,
by His eternal laws, He gets rid of bad men for us; and, as the saying
is, civilizes them off the face of the earth in the third or fourth
generation.&nbsp; And God does so.&nbsp; If a family, or a class, or
a whole nation becomes incorrigibly profligate, foolish, base, in three
or four generations they will either die out or vanish.&nbsp; They will
sink to the bottom of society, and become miserably poor, weak, and
of no influence, and so unable to do harm to any but themselves.&nbsp;
Whole families will sink thus, I have seen it; you may have seen it.&nbsp;
Whole nations will sink thus; as the Jews sank in Ezekiel&rsquo;s time,
and again in our Lord&rsquo;s time; and be conquered, trampled on, counted
for nothing, because they were worth nothing.</p>
<p>But now suppose, again, that the children, when their father&rsquo;s
sins are visited on them, are <i>not</i> incorrigible.&nbsp; Suppose
they are like the wise son of whom Ezekiel speaks, in the 14th verse,
who seeth all his father&rsquo;s sins, and considereth, and doeth not
such like&mdash;then has not God been merciful and kind to him in visiting
his father&rsquo;s sins on him?&nbsp; He has.&nbsp; God is justified
therein.&nbsp; His eternal laws of natural retribution, severe as they
are, have worked in love and in mercy, if they have taught the young
man the ruinousness, the deadliness of sin.&nbsp; Have the father&rsquo;s
sins made the son poor?&nbsp; Then he learns not to make his children
poor by his sin.&nbsp; Have his father&rsquo;s sins made him unhealthy?&nbsp;
Then he learns not to injure his children&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; Have
his father&rsquo;s sins kept him ignorant, or in anywise hindered his
rise in life?&nbsp; Then he learns the value of a good education, and,
perhaps, stints himself to give his children advantages which he had
not himself&mdash;and, as sure as he does so, the family begins to rise
again after its fall.&nbsp; This is no fancy, it is fact.&nbsp; You
may see it.&nbsp; I have seen it, thank God.&nbsp; How some of the purest
and noblest women, some of the ablest and most right-minded men, will
spring from families, will be reared in households, where everything
was against them&mdash;where there was everything to make them profligate,
false, reckless, in a word&mdash;bad&mdash;except the grace of God,
which was trying to make them good, and succeeded in making them good;
and how, though they have felt the punishment of their parents&rsquo;
sins upon them in many ways during their whole life, yet that has been
to them not a mere punishment, but a chastisement, a purifying medicine,
a cross to be borne, which only stirred them up to greater watchfulness
against sin, to greater earnestness in educating their children, to
greater activity and energy in doing right, and giving their children
the advantages which they had not themselves.&nbsp; And so were fulfilled
in them two laws of God.&nbsp; The one which Ezekiel lays down&mdash;that
the bad man&rsquo;s son who executes God&rsquo;s judgments and walks
in God&rsquo;s statutes shall not die for the iniquity of his father,
but surely live; and the other law which Moses lays down&mdash;that
God shews mercy unto thousands of generations, as I believe it means&mdash;that
is, to son after father, and son after father again, without end&mdash;as
long as they love Him and keep His commandments.</p>
<p>I do not, therefore, see that there is any real contradiction between
what Moses says in the second commandment and what Ezekiel says in this
chapter.&nbsp; They are but two different sides of the same truth; and
Moses is shewing the Jews one side, because they needed most to be taught
that in his time, and Ezekiel showing them the other, because that was
the teaching which they needed most then.&nbsp; For they were fancying
themselves, in their calamities, the victims of some blind and cruel
fate, and had forgotten that, when God said that He visited the sins
of the fathers on the children, He qualified it by saying, &ldquo;of
them that hate Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore, be hopeful about yourselves, and hopeful about your children
after you.&nbsp; If any one here feels&mdash;I am fallen very low in
the world&mdash;here all has been so much against me&mdash;my parents
were the ruin of me&mdash;Let him remember this one word of Ezekiel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith
the Lord God: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Let him turn from his father&rsquo;s evil ways, and do that which is
lawful and right, and then he can say with the Prophet, in answer to
all the strokes of fortune and the miseries of circumstance, &ldquo;Rejoice
not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall I shall arise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Provided he will remember that God requires of all men something, which
is, to be as good as they can be; then he may remember also that our
Lord Himself says, &ldquo;Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall
much be required;&rdquo; implying that to whom little is given, of him
will little be required.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s ways are not unequal.&nbsp;
He has one equal, fair, and just rule for every human being; and that
is perfect understanding, perfect sympathy, perfect good will, and therefore
perfect justice and perfect love.</p>
<p>And if any one of you answers in his heart&mdash;these are good words,
and all very well: but they come too late.&nbsp; I am too far gone.&nbsp;
I ate the sour grapes in my youth, and my teeth must be on edge for
ever and ever.&nbsp; I have been a bad man, or I have been a foolish
woman too many years to mend now.&nbsp; I am down, and down I must be.&nbsp;
I have made my bed, and I must lie on it, and die on it too.&nbsp; Oh
my dear brother or sister in Christ, whoever you are who says that,
unsay it again for it is not true.&nbsp; Ezekiel tells you that it is
not true, and one greater than Ezekiel, Jesus Christ, your Saviour,
your Lord, your God, tells you it is not true.</p>
<p>For what happens, by God&rsquo;s eternal and unchangeable laws of
retribution, to a whole nation, or a whole family, may happen to you&mdash;to
each individual man.&nbsp; They fall by sin; they rise again by repentance
and amendment.&nbsp; They may rise punished by their sins, and punished
for a long time, heavily weighted by the consequences of their own folly,
and heavily weighted for a long time.&nbsp; But they rise&mdash;they
enter into their new life weak and wounded, from their own fault.&nbsp;
But they enter in.&nbsp; And from that day things begin to mend&mdash;the
weather begins to clear, the soil begins to yield again&mdash;punishment
gradually ceases when it has done its work, the weight lightens, the
wounds heal, the weakness strengthens, and by God&rsquo;s grace within
them, and by God&rsquo;s providence outside them, they are made men
of again, and saved.&nbsp; So you will surely find it in the experience
of life.</p>
<p>No doubt in general, in most cases,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The child is father of the man</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>for good and evil.&nbsp; A pious and virtuous youth helps, by sure
laws of God, towards a pious and virtuous old age.&nbsp; And on the
other hand, an ungodly and profligate youth leads, by the same laws,
toward an ungodly and profligate old age.&nbsp; That is the law.&nbsp;
But there is another law which may stop that law&mdash;just as the stone
falls to the ground by the natural law of weight, and yet you may stop
that law by using the law of bodily strength, and holding it up in your
hand.&nbsp; And what is the gracious law which will save you from the
terrible law which will make you go on from worse to worse?</p>
<p>It is this,&mdash;&ldquo;when the wicked man turneth away from his
wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and
right, he shall save his soul alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not said that
his soul shall come in a moment to perfect health and strength.&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; There are old bad habits to be got rid of, old ties to be
broken, old debts (often worse debts than any money debts) to be paid.&nbsp;
But he shall save his soul alive.&nbsp; His soul shall not die of its
disease.&nbsp; It shall be saved.&nbsp; It shall come to life, and gradually
mend and be cured, and grow from strength to strength, as a sick man
mends day by day after a deadly illness, slowly it may be, but surely:&mdash;for
how can you fail of being cured if your physician is none other than
Jesus Christ your Lord and your God?</p>
<p>Oh, recollect that last word.&nbsp; If you will but recollect that,
you will never despair.&nbsp; How dare any man say&mdash;Bad I am, and
bad I must remain&mdash;while the God who made heaven and earth offers
to make you good?&nbsp; Who dare say,&mdash;I cannot amend&mdash;when
God Himself offers to amend you?&nbsp; Who dare say,&mdash;I have no
strength to amend&mdash;when God offers to give you strength, strength
of His strength, and life of His life, even His Holy Spirit?&nbsp; Who
dare say,&mdash;God has given me up; He has a grudge against me which
He will not lay by, an anger against me which cannot be appeased, a
score against me which will never be wiped out of His book?&nbsp; Oh
foolish and faint-hearted soul.&nbsp; Look, look at Christ hanging on
His cross, and see there what God&rsquo;s grudge, God&rsquo;s anger,
God&rsquo;s score of your sins is like.&nbsp; Like love unspeakable,
and nothing else.&nbsp; To wash out your sins, He spared not His only
begotten Son, but freely gave Him for you, to shew you that God, so
far from hating you, has loved you; that so far from being your enemy,
He was your father; that so far from willing the death of a sinner,
He willed that you and every sinner should turn from his wickedness
and live.&nbsp; For that, Jesus the only begotten Son of God, came down
and preached, and sorrowed, and suffered, and died upon the cross.&nbsp;
He died that you may live; He suffered that you may be saved; He paid
the debt, because you could never pay it; He bore your sins upon the
cross, that you might not have to bear them for ever and for ever in
eternal death.&nbsp; Now, even if you suffer somewhat in this life for
your sins, that suffering is not punishment, but wholesome chastisement,
as when a father chastens the son in whom he delighteth.&nbsp; All He
asks of you is to long and try to give up your sins, for He will help
you to give them up.&nbsp; All He asks of you is to long and try to
lead a new life, for He will give you power to lead a new life.&nbsp;
Oh, say not&mdash;I cannot&mdash;when Christ who died for you says you
can.&nbsp; Say not&mdash;I dare not&mdash;when Christ bids you dare
come boldly to His throne of grace.&nbsp; Say not&mdash;I must be as
I am&mdash;when Christ died that you should <i>not</i> be as you are.&nbsp;
Say not&mdash;there is no hope&mdash;when Christ died and rose again,
and reigns for ever, to give hope to you and all mankind, that when
the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed,
and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive,
and all his transgressions shall not be mentioned unto him, but in his
righteousness that he hath done shall he live.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXVII.&nbsp; AGREE WITH THINE ADVERSARY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, 1861.&nbsp; <i>Windsor Castle</i>, 1867.</p>
<p>St. Matthew v. 25, 26.&nbsp; &ldquo;Agree with thine adversary quickly,
whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary
deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer,
and thou be cast into prison.&nbsp; Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt
by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This parable our Lord seems to have spoken at least twice, as He
did several others.&nbsp; For we find it also in the 12th chapter of
St. Luke.&nbsp; But it is there part of quite a different discourse.&nbsp;
I think that by seeing what it means there, we shall see more clearly
what it means here.</p>
<p>Our Lord there is speaking of the sins of the whole Jewish nation.&nbsp;
Here He is speaking rather of each man&rsquo;s private sins.&nbsp; But
He applies the same parable to both.&nbsp; He gives the same warning
to both.&nbsp; Not to go too far on the wrong road, lest they come to
a point where they cannot turn back, but must go on to just punishment,
if not to utter destruction.</p>
<p>That is what He warned the Jews all through the latter part of the
12th chapter of Luke.&nbsp; He will come again, He says, at an hour
they do not think of, and then if their elders, the Scribes and Pharisees,
are going on as they are now, beating the man-servants and maid-servants,
and eating and drinking with the drunken, oppressing the people, and
living in luxury and profligacy, He will cut them asunder, and appoint
them their portion with the unbelievers.</p>
<p>In this, and in many other parables, He had been warning them that
their ruin was near; and, at last, turning to the whole crowd, He appeals
to them, to their common sense.&nbsp; &ldquo;When ye see a cloud rise
out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it
is.&nbsp; And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be
heat; and it cometh to pass.&nbsp; Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the
face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern
this time?&rdquo;&nbsp; If God can give you common sense about one thing,
why not about another?&nbsp; Why can you not open your eyes and of yourselves
judge what is right?&nbsp; &ldquo;Agree with thine adversary quickly,
whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary
deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer,
and thou be cast into prison.&nbsp; Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt
by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So He spoke; and they did not fully understand what He meant.&nbsp;
They thought that by their adversary He meant the Roman governor.&nbsp;
For they immediately began to talk to Him about some Galileans whose
blood Pilate, the Roman governor, had mingled with their sacrifices
(I suppose in some of those wars which were continually breaking out
in Judea).&nbsp; I think He meant more than that.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose
ye that these Galil&aelig;ans were sinners above all the Galil&aelig;ans?&nbsp;
Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.&rdquo;&nbsp; As much
as to say, though ye did not rebel against the Romans like these Galil&aelig;ans,
you have your sins, which will ruin <i>you</i>.&nbsp; As long as you
are hypocrites, with your mouths full of the cant of religion, and your
hearts full of all mean and spiteful passions; as long as you cannot
of yourselves discern what is right, and have lost conscience, and the
everlasting distinction between right and wrong, so long are you walking
blindfold to ruin.&nbsp; There is an adversary against you, who will
surely deliver you to the judge some day, and then it will be too late
to cry for mercy.&nbsp; And who was that adversary?&nbsp; Who but the
everlasting law of God, which says, Thou shalt do justly?&mdash;and
you Jews are utterly unjust, false, covetous, and unrighteous.&nbsp;
Thou shalt love all men; and you are cruel and spiteful, hating each
other, and making all mankind hate you.&nbsp; Thou shalt walk humbly
with thy God; and you Jews are walking proudly with God; fancying that
God belongs only to you; that because you are His chosen people, He
will let you commit every sin you choose, as long as you keep His name
on your lips, and keep up an empty worship of Him in the temple.&nbsp;
That is your adversary, the everlasting moral law of God.&nbsp; And
who is the Judge but God Himself, who is set on His throne judging right,
while you are doing wrong?&nbsp; And who is the officer, to whom that
judge will deliver you?&nbsp; There indeed the Jews were right.&nbsp;
It was the Romans whom God appointed to punish them for their sins.&nbsp;
All which our Lord had foretold, as all the world knows, came true forty
years after in that horrible siege of Jerusalem, which the Jews brought
on themselves entirely by their own folly, and pride, and wicked lawlessness.&nbsp;
In that siege, by famine and pestilence, by the Romans&rsquo; swords,
by crucifixion, and by each other&rsquo;s hands (for the different factions
were murdering each other wholesale up to the very day Jerusalem was
taken), thousands of Jews perished horribly, and the rest were sold
as slaves over the face of the whole earth, and led away into a captivity
from which they could not escape till they had paid the uttermost farthing.</p>
<p>Now let us look at this same parable in the 5th chapter of St Matthew.&nbsp;
Remember first that it is part of the sermon on the Mount, which is
all about not doctrine, but morality, the law of right and wrong, the
law of justice and mercy.&nbsp; You will see then that our Lord is preaching
against the same sins as in the 12th chapter of St. Luke.&nbsp; Against
a hypocritical religion, joined with a cruel and unjust heart.&nbsp;
Those of old time, the Scribes and Pharisees, said merely, Thou shalt
not kill.&nbsp; And as long as thou dost not kill thy brother, thou
mayest hate him in thy heart and speak evil of him with thy lips.&nbsp;
But our Lord says, Not so.&nbsp; Whosoever is angry with his brother
without a cause is in danger of the judgment.&nbsp; Whosoever shall
say to him Raca, or worthless fellow, shall speak insolently, brutally,
cruelly, scornfully to him, is in danger of the council.&nbsp; But whosoever
shall say unto him, Thou fool, is in danger of hell fire.&nbsp; For
using that word to the Jews, so says the Talmudic tradition, Moses and
Aaron were shut out of the land of promise, for it means an infidel,
an atheist, a godless man, or rebel against God, as it is written, &ldquo;The
fool hath said in his heart there is no God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whosoever
shall curse his brother, who is trying to be a good Christian man to
the best of his light and power, because he does not happen to agree
with him in all things, and call him a heretic, and an infidel, and
an atheist, and an enemy of God&mdash;he is in danger of hell fire.&nbsp;
Let him agree with his adversary quickly, whiles he is in the way with
him, lest he be delivered to God the judge, and to the just punishment
of him who has not done justly, not loved mercy, not walked humbly with
his God.</p>
<p>But who is the adversary of that man, and who is the judge, and who
is the officer?&nbsp; Our adversary in every case, whenever we do wrong,
knowingly or unknowingly, is the Law of God, the everlasting laws, by
which God has ordered every thing in heaven and earth; and as often
as we break one of these laws, let us agree with it again as quickly
as we can, lest it hale us before God, the judge of all, and He deliver
us over to His officer&mdash;to those powers of nature and powers of
spirit, which He has appointed as ministers of His vengeance, and they
cast us into some prison of necessary and unavoidable misery, from which
we shall never escape till we have paid the uttermost farthing.</p>
<p>Do you not understand me?&nbsp; Then I will give you an example.&nbsp;
Suppose the case of a man hurting his health by self-indulgence of any
kind.&nbsp; Then his adversaries are the laws of health.&nbsp; Let him
agree with them quickly, while he has the power of conquering his bad
habits, by recovering his health, lest the time come when his own sins
deliver him up to God his judge; and God to His terrible officers of
punishment, the laws of Disease; and they cast him into a prison of
shame and misery from which there is no escape&mdash;shame and misery,
most common perhaps among the lower classes: but not altogether confined
to them&mdash;the weakened body, the bleared eye, the stupified brain,
the premature death, the children unhealthy from their parents&rsquo;
sins, despising their parents, and perhaps copying their vices at the
same time.&nbsp; Many a man have I seen in that prison, fast bound with
misery though not with iron, and how he was to pay his debt and escape
out of it I know not, though I hope that God does know.</p>
<p>Are any of you, again, in the habit of cheating your neighbours,
or dealing unfairly by them?&nbsp; Your adversary is the everlasting
law of justice, which says, Do as you would be done by, for with what
measure you mete to others, it shall be measured to you again.</p>
<p>This may show you how a bodily sin, like self-indulgence punishes
itself by bringing a man into bondage of bodily misery, from which he
cannot escape; and in the same way a spiritual sin, like want of charity,
will bring a man into spiritual bondage from which he cannot escape.&nbsp;
And this, as in bodily sins, it will do by virtue of that mysterious
and terrible officer of God, which we call Habit.&nbsp; Habit, by which,
we cannot tell how, our having done a thing once becomes a reason for
our doing it again, and again after that, till, if the habit be once
formed, we cannot help doing that thing, and become enslaved to it,
and fast bound by it, in a prison from which there is no escape.&nbsp;
Look for instance at the case of the untruthful man.&nbsp; Let him beware
in time.&nbsp; Who is his adversary?&nbsp; Facts are his adversary.&nbsp;
He says one thing, and Fact says another, and a very stubborn and terrible
adversary Fact is.&nbsp; The day will come, most probably in this life,
when Facts will bring that untruthful man before God and before men
likewise&mdash;and cry,&mdash;Judge between us which of us is right;
and there will come to that false man exposure and shame, and a worse
punishment still, perhaps, if he have let the habit grow too strong
on him, and have not agreed with his adversary in time.</p>
<p>For have you not seen (alas, you have too surely seen) men who had
contracted such a habit of falsehood that they could not shake it off&mdash;who
had played with their sense of truth so long that they had almost forgotten
what truth meant; men who could not speak without mystery, concealment,
prevarication, half-statements; who were afraid of the plain truth,
not because there was any present prospect of its hurting them, but
simply because it was the plain truth&mdash;children of darkness, who,
from long habit, hated the light&mdash;and who, though they had been
found out and exposed, could not amend&mdash;could not become simple,
honest, and truthful&mdash;could not escape from the prison of their
own bad habits, and the net of lies which they had spread round their
own path, till they had paid the uttermost penalty for their deceit?</p>
<p>Look, again, at the case of the uncharitable man, in the habit of
forming harsh and cruel judgments of his neighbours.&nbsp; Then his
adversary is the everlasting law of Love, which will surely at last
punish him, by the most terrible of all punishments&mdash;loss of love
to man, and therefore to God.&nbsp; Are we not (I am, I know, may God
forgive me for it) apt to be angry with our brethren without a cause,
out of mere peevishness?&nbsp; Let us beware in time.&nbsp; Are we not
apt to say to them &ldquo;Raca&rdquo;&mdash;to speak cruelly, contemptuously,
fiercely of them, if they thwart us?&nbsp; Let us beware in time still
more.&nbsp; Are we not worst of all, tempted (as I too often am) to
say to them &ldquo;Thou fool;&rdquo; to call better men, more useful
men more pure men, more pious men than ourselves, hard and cruel names,
names from which they would shrink with horror because they cannot see
Christian truth in just exactly the same light that we do?&nbsp; Oh!
let us beware then.&nbsp; Beware lest the everlasting laws of justice
and fairness between man and man, of love and charity between man and
man, which we have broken, should some day deliver us up, as they delivered
those bigoted Jews of old to God our Judge, and He deliver our souls
to His most terrible officers, who are called envy, hatred, malice,
and all uncharitableness; and they thrust us into that blackest of all
prisons, on the gate of which is written, Hardness of heart, and Contempt
of God&rsquo;s Word and commandments, and within which is the outer
darkness into which if a man falls, he cannot see the difference between
right and wrong: but calls evil good, and good evil, like his companions
in the outer darkness&mdash;namely, the devil and his angels.&nbsp;
Oh! let us who are coming to lay our gift upon God&rsquo;s altar at
this approaching Christmas tide, consider whether our brother hath aught
against us in any of these matters, and, if so, let us leave our gift
upon the altar, and be first reconciled to our brother, in heart at
least, and with inward shame, and confession, and contrition, and resolution
to amend.&nbsp; But we can only do that by recollecting what gift we
are to leave on Christ&rsquo;s altar,&mdash;that it is the gift of <i>self</i>,
the sacrifice of ourselves, with all our selfishness, pride, conceit,
spite, cruelty.&nbsp; Ourselves, with all our sins, we are to lay upon
Christ&rsquo;s altar, that our sins may be nailed to His cross, and
washed clean in His blood, everlastingly consumed in the fire of His
Spirit, the pure spirit of love, which is the Charity of God, that so,
self being purged out of us, we may become holy and lively sacrifices
to God, parts and parcels of that perfect sacrifice which Christ offered
up for the sins of the whole world&mdash;even the sacrifice of Himself.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXVIII.&nbsp; ST JOHN THE BAPTIST</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Chester Cathedral</i>. 1872.</p>
<p>St Luke iii. 2, 3, 7, 9-14.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Word of God came unto
John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.&nbsp; And he came into
all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for
the remission of sins. . . . Then said he to the multitude that came
forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come?&nbsp; Bring forth therefore fruits
worthy of repentance. . . .&nbsp; And now also the axe is laid unto
the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth
good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.&nbsp; And the people
asked him saying, What shall we do then?&nbsp; He answereth and saith
unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none;
and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.&nbsp; Then came also publicans
to be baptized unto them, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?&nbsp;
And he said, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.&nbsp; And
the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do?&nbsp;
And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely,
and be content with your wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is St John Baptist&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; Let me say a very few
words&mdash;where many might be said&mdash;about one of the noblest
personages who ever has appeared on this earth.</p>
<p>Our blessed Lord said, &ldquo;Among them that are born of women there
hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist, notwithstanding, he
that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These are serious words; for which of us dare to say that we are greater
than John the Baptist?</p>
<p>But let us at least think a while what John the Baptist was like.&nbsp;
So we shall gain at least the sight of an ideal man.&nbsp; It is not
the highest ideal.&nbsp; Our Lord tells us that plainly; and we, as
Christians, should know that it is not.&nbsp; The ideal man is our Lord
Christ Himself, and none other.&nbsp; Still, he that has not mounted
the lower step of the heavenly stair, has certainly not mounted the
higher; and therefore, if we have not attained to the likeness of John
the Baptist, still more, we have not attained to the likeness of Christ.&nbsp;
What, then, was John the Baptist like?&nbsp; What picture of him and
his character can we form to ourselves in our own imaginations? for
that is all we have to picture him by&mdash;helped&mdash;always remember
that&mdash;by the Holy Spirit of God, who helps the imagination, the
poetic and dramatic faculty of men; just as much as He helps the logical
and argumentative faculty to see things and men as they really are,
by the spirit of love, which also is the spirit of true understanding.</p>
<p>How, then, shall we picture John the Baptist to ourselves?&nbsp;
Great painters, greater than the world seems likely to see again, have
exercised their fancy upon his face, his figure, his actions.&nbsp;
We must put out of our minds, I fear, at once, many of the loveliest
of them all: those in which Raffaelle and others have depicted the child
John, in his camel&rsquo;s hair raiment, with a child&rsquo;s cross
in his hand, worshipping the infant Christ.&nbsp; There is also one
exquisite picture, by Annibale Caracci, if I recollect rightly, in which
the blessed babe is lying asleep, and the blessed Virgin signs to St
John, pressing forward to adore him, not to awaken his sleeping Lord
and God.&nbsp; But such imaginations, beautiful as they are, and true
in a heavenly and spiritual sense, which therefore is true eternally
for you, and me, and all mankind, are not historic fact.&nbsp; For St
John the Baptist said himself, &ldquo;and I knew him not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He may have been, we must almost say, he must have been, brought
up with or near our Lord.&nbsp; He may have seen in Him such a child
(we must believe that), as he never saw before.&nbsp; He knew Him at
least to be a princely child, of David&rsquo;s royal line.&nbsp; But
he was not conscious of who and what He was, till the mysterious inner
voice, of whom he gives only the darkest hints, said to him, &ldquo;Upon
whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the
same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; And I saw and
bare record that this is the Son of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; But what manner
of man was St John the Baptist in the meantime?&nbsp; Painters have
tried their hands at drawing him, and we thank them.&nbsp; Pictures,
says St Augustine, are the books of the unlearned.&nbsp; And, my friends,
when great painters paint, they are the books of the too-learned likewise.&nbsp;
They bring us back, bring us home, by one glance at a human face, a
human figure, a human scene of action, out of our philosophies, and
criticisms, and doctrines, which narrow our hearts, without widening
our heads, to the deeper facts of humanity, and therefore to the deeper
facts of theology likewise.&nbsp; But what picture of St John the Baptist
shall we choose whereby to represent him to ourselves, as the forerunner
of the incarnate God?</p>
<p>The best which I can recollect is the great picture by Guido&mdash;ah,
that he had painted always as wisely and as well&mdash;of the magnificent
lad sitting on the rock, half clad in his camel&rsquo;s hair robe, his
stalwart hand lifted up to denounce he hardly knows what, save that
things are going all wrong, utterly wrong to him; his beautiful mouth
open to preach, he hardly knows what, save that he has a message from
God, of which he is half-conscious as yet&mdash;that he is a forerunner,
a prophet, a foreteller of something and some one which is to come,
and which yet is very near at hand.&nbsp; The wild rocks are round him,
the clear sky is over him, and nothing more.&nbsp; He, the gentleman
born, the clergyman born&mdash;for you must recollect who and what St
John the Baptist was, and that he was neither democrat nor vulgar demagogue,
nor flatterer of ignorant mobs, but a man of an ancestry as ancient
and illustrious as it was civilised, and bound by long ties of duty,
of patriotism, of religion, and of the temple worship of God:&mdash;he,
the noble and the priest, has thrown off&mdash;not in discontent and
desperation, but in hope and awe&mdash;all his family privileges, all
that seems to make life worth having; and there aloft and in the mountains,
alone with nature and with God, feeding on locusts and wild honey and
whatsoever God shall send, and clothed in skins, he, like Elijah of
old, renews not merely the habits, but the spirit and power of Elijah,
and preaches to a generation sunk in covetousness and superstition,
party spirit, and the rest of the seven devils which brought on the
fall of his native land, and which will bring on the fall of every land
on earth, preaches to them, I say&mdash;What?</p>
<p>The most common, let me say boldly, the most vulgar&mdash;in the
good old sense of the word&mdash;the most vulgar morality.&nbsp; He
tells them that an awful ruin was coming unless they repented and mended.&nbsp;
How fearfully true his words were, the next fifty years proved.&nbsp;
The axe, he said, was laid to the root of the tree; and the axe was
the heathen Roman, even then master of the land.&nbsp; But God, not
the Roman C&aelig;sar merely, was laying the axe.&nbsp; And He was a
good God, who only wanted goodness, which He would preserve; not badness,
which He would destroy.&nbsp; Therefore men must not merely repent and
do penance, they must bring forth fruits meet for penance; do right
instead of doing wrong, lest they be found barren trees, and be cut
down, and cast into that everlasting fire of God, which, thanks be to
His Holy name, burns for ever&mdash;unquenchable by all men&rsquo;s
politics, and systems, and political or other economies, to destroy
out of God&rsquo;s Kingdom all that offendeth and whatsoever loveth
and maketh a lie&mdash;oppressors, quacks, cheats, hypocrites, and the
rest.</p>
<p>The people&mdash;the farming class&mdash;came to him with &ldquo;What
shall we do?&rdquo;&nbsp; The young priest and nobleman, in his garment
of camel&rsquo;s hair, has nothing but plain morality for them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none;
and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.&rdquo;&nbsp; The publicans,
the renegades, who were farming the taxes of the Roman conquerors, and
making their base profit out of their countrymen&rsquo;s slavery, came
to him,&mdash;&ldquo;Master, what shall we do?&rdquo;&nbsp; He does
not tell them not to be publicans.&nbsp; He does not tell his countrymen
to rebel, though he must have been sorely tempted to do it.&nbsp; All
he says is, Make the bad and base arrangement as good as you can; exact
no more than that which is appointed you.&nbsp; The soldiers, poor fellows,
come to him.&nbsp; Whether they were Herod&rsquo;s mercenaries, or real
gallant Roman soldiers, we are not told.&nbsp; Either had unlimited
power under a military despotism, in an anarchic and half-enslaved country;
but whichever they were, he has the same answer to them of common morality.&nbsp;
You are what you are; you are where you are.&nbsp; Do it as well as
you can.&nbsp; Do no violence to any man, neither accuse any man falsely,
and be content with your wages.</p>
<p>Ah, wise politician, ah, clear and rational spirit, who knows and
tells others to do the duty which lies nearest them; who sees (as old
Greek Hesiod says), how much bigger the half is than the whole; who,
in the hour of his country&rsquo;s deepest degradation, had divine courage
to say, our deliverance lies, not in rebellion, but in doing right.&nbsp;
But he has sterner words.&nbsp; Pharisees, the separatists, the religious
men, who think themselves holier than any one else; and Sadducees, materialist
men of the world, who sneer at the unseen, the unknown, the heroic,
come to him.&nbsp; And for Pharisee and Sadducee&mdash;for the man who
prides himself on believing more than his neighbours, and for the man
who prides himself on believing less&mdash;he has the same answer.&nbsp;
Both are exclusives, inhuman, while they are pretending to be more than
human.&nbsp; He knew them well, for he was born and bred among them,
and he forestalls our Lord&rsquo;s words to them, &ldquo;O generation
of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last his preaching of common morality is put to the highest test.&nbsp;
The king&mdash;the tyrant as we should call him&mdash;the Herod of the
day, an usurper, neither a son of David, nor a king chosen by the people,
tries to patronize him.&nbsp; The old spirit of his forefather Aaron,
of his forefather Phineas, the spirit of Levi, which (rightly understood),
is the Spirit of God, flashes up in the young priestly prophet, in the
old form of common morality.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not lawful for thee
to have thy brother&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; We know the rest; how,
at the request of Herodias&rsquo; daughter, Herod sent and beheaded
John in prison, and how she took his head in a charger and brought it
to her mother.&nbsp; Great painters have shown us again and again the
last act&mdash;outwardly hideous, but really beautiful&mdash;of St John&rsquo;s
heroic drama, in a picture of the lovely dancing girl with the prophet&rsquo;s
head in a charger&mdash;a dreadful picture; and yet one which needed
to be painted, for it was a terrible fact, and is still, and will be
till this wicked world&rsquo;s end, a matter for pity and tears rather
than for indignation.&nbsp; The most perfect representations, certainly
the most tragical I know of it, are those which are remarkable, not
for their expression, but for their want of expression&mdash;the young
girl in brocade and jewels, with the gory head in her hands, thinking
of nothing out of those wide vacant foolish eyes, save the triumph of
self-satisfied vanity; for the spite and revenge is not in her, but
in her wicked mother.&nbsp; She is just the very creature, who, if she
had been better trained, and taught what John the Baptist really was,
might have reverenced him, worshipped him, and ministered unto him.&nbsp;
Alas! alas! how do the follies of poor humanity repeat themselves in
every age.&nbsp; The butterfly has killed the lion, without after all
meaning much harm.&nbsp; Ah, that such human butterflies would take
warning by the fate of Herodias&rsquo; daughter, and see how mere vanity
will lead, if indulged too long and too freely, to awful crime.</p>
<p>One knows the old stories,&mdash;how Herod, and Herodias, and the
vain foolish girl fell into disgrace with the Emperor, and were banished
into Provence, and died in want and misery.&nbsp; One knows too the
old legends, how Herodias&rsquo; daughter reappears in South Europe&mdash;even
in old German legends&mdash;as the witch-goddess, fair and ruinous,
sweeping for ever through wood and wold at night with her troop of fiends,
tempting the traveller to dance with them till he dies; a name for ever
accursed through its own vanity rather than its own deliberate sin,
from which may God preserve us all, men as well as women.&nbsp; So two
women, one wicked and one vain, did all they could to destroy one of
the noblest human beings who ever walked this earth.&nbsp; And what
did they do?&nbsp; They did not prevent his being the forerunner and
prophet of the incarnate Son of God.&nbsp; They did not prevent his
being the master and teacher of the blessed Apostle St John, who was
his spiritual son and heir.&nbsp; They did not prevent his teaching
all men and women, to whom God gives grace to understand him, that the
true repentance, the true conversion, the true deliverance from the
wrath to come, the true entrance into the kingdom of heaven, the true
way to Christ and to God, is common morality.</p>
<p>And now let us bless God&rsquo;s holy name for all His servants departed
in His faith and fear, and especially for His servant St John the Baptist,
beseeching Him to give us grace, so to follow his doctrine and holy
life, that we may truly repent after his preaching and after his example.&nbsp;
May the Lord forgive our exceeding cowardice, and help us constantly
to speak the truth, boldly rebuke vice, and patiently suffer for the
truth&rsquo;s sake; through Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXIX.&nbsp; THE PRESENT RECOMPENSE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Chester Cathedral</i>, <i>Nave Service</i>, <i>Evening.&nbsp;
May</i> 1872.</p>
<p>Proverbs xi. 31.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed
in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the key-note of the Book of Proverbs&mdash;that men are punished
or rewarded according to their deeds in this life; nay, it is the key-note
of the whole Old Testament.&nbsp; &ldquo;The eyes of the Lord are over
the righteous, and His ears are open unto their prayers; the countenance
of the Lord is against them that do evil, to root out the remembrance
of them from the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here, at the beginning of my sermon, I can fancy some one ready
to cry&mdash;Stay! you have spoken too strongly.&nbsp; That is not the
key-note of the whole Old Testament.&nbsp; There are words in it of
quite a different note&mdash;words which complain to God that the good
are not rewarded, and the wicked are not punished: as for instance,
when the Psalmist says how the ungodly men of this evil world are filled
with God&rsquo;s hid treasure, and how they have children at their desire,
and leave the rest of their substance for their babes.&nbsp; And again,
&ldquo;I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the
wicked.&nbsp; For there are no bands in their death; but their strength
is firm.&nbsp; They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they
plagued like other men. . . .&nbsp; They set their mouth against the
heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.&nbsp; Therefore
his people return hither; and waters of a full cup are wrung out to
them.&nbsp; And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge
in the most High?&rdquo;&nbsp; And though the Psalmist says that such
persons will come to a sudden and fearful end, yet he confesses that
so long as they live they have prospered, while he had been punished
all day long, and chastened every morning.&nbsp; And do we not know
that so it is?&nbsp; Is it not obvious now, and has it not been notorious
in every country, and in all times, that so it is?&nbsp; Do not good
men often lead lives of poverty and affliction?&nbsp; Do not men make
large fortunes, or rise to fame and power, by base and wicked means?
and do not those same men often enough die in their beds, and leave
children behind them, and found families, who prosper for generations
after they are dead?&nbsp; How were they recompensed in the earth?&nbsp;
Now this is one of the puzzles of life, which tries a man&rsquo;s faith
in God, as it tried the psalmists and prophets in old time.&nbsp; But
that the text speaks truth I do not doubt.&nbsp; I believe that the
prosperous bad man is recompensed in the earth&mdash;is punished in
this life&mdash;often with the most terrible of all punishments&mdash;Impunity;
the not being punished at all; which is the worst thing in this life
which can happen to a sinner.&nbsp; But I am not going to speak of that,
but rather of the first part of the text, &ldquo;The righteous shall
be recompensed in the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now is not the answer to the puzzle this: That God is impartial;
that He is no respecter of persons, but causing His sun to shine on
the evil and on the good, and His rain to fall on the just and on the
unjust; and so rewarding every man according to his work, paying him
for all work done, of whatever kind it may be?&nbsp; Some work for this
world, which we do see, and God gives them what they earn in this life;
some work for the world above, which we cannot see, and God gives them
what they earn in this life, for ever and ever likewise.&nbsp; If a
man wishes for treasure on earth, he can have it if he will, and enjoy
it as long as it lasts.&nbsp; If a man wishes for treasure in heaven,
he can have it if he will, and enjoy it as long as it lasts.&nbsp; God
deals fairly with both, and pays both what they have earned.</p>
<p>Some set their hearts on this world; some want money, some want power,
some want fame and admiration from their fellow-men, some want merely
to amuse themselves.&nbsp; Then they will have what they want if they
will take the right way to get it.&nbsp; If a man wishes to make a large
fortune, and die rich, he will very probably succeed, if he will only
follow diligently the laws and rules by which God has appointed that
money should be made.&nbsp; If a man longs for power and glory, and
must needs be admired and obeyed by his fellow-men, he can have his
wish, if he will go the right way to get what he longs for; especially
in a free country like this, he will get most probably just as much
of them as he deserves&mdash;that is, as much as he has talent and knowledge
enough to earn.&nbsp; So did the Pharisees in our Lord&rsquo;s time.&nbsp;
They wanted power, fame, and money as religious leaders, and they knew
how to get them as well as any men who ever lived; and they got them.&nbsp;
Our Lord did not deny that.&nbsp; They had their reward, He said.&nbsp;
They succeeded&mdash;those old Pharisees&mdash;in being looked up to
as the masters of the Jewish mob, and in crucifying our Lord Himself.&nbsp;
They had their reward; and so may you and I.&nbsp; If we want any earthly
thing, and have knowledge of the way to get it, and have ability and
perseverance enough, then we shall very probably get it, and much good
it will do us when we have got it after all.&nbsp; We shall have had
our treasure upon earth and our hearts likewise; and when we come to
die we shall leave both our treasure and our hearts behind us, and the
Lord have mercy on our souls.</p>
<p>But again, there are those, thank God, who have, or are at least
trying to get, treasure in heaven, which they may carry away with them
when they die, and keep for ever.&nbsp; And who are they?&nbsp; Those
who are longing and trying to be true and to be good; who have seen
how beautiful it is to be true and to be good; to know God and the will
of God; to love God and the will of God; and therefore to copy His likeness
and to do His will.&nbsp; Those who long for sanctification, and who
desire to be holy, even as their Father in heaven is holy, and perfect,
even as their Father in heaven is perfect; and who therefore think,
as St Paul bade them, of whatsoever things are just, true, pure, lovely,
and of good report, if there be any true manhood, and if there be any
just praise&mdash;in three words&mdash;who seek after whatsoever is
true, beautiful, and good.&nbsp; These are they that have treasure in
heaven.&nbsp; For what is really true, really beautiful, really good,
is also really heavenly.&nbsp; God alone is perfect, good, beautiful,
and true; and heaven is heaven because it is filled with the glory of
His goodness, His beauty, and His truth.&nbsp; But wherever there is
a soul on earth led by the Spirit of God, and filled by the Spirit of
God with good and beautiful and true graces and inspirations, there
is a soul which, as St Paul says, is sitting in heavenly places with
Christ Jesus&mdash;a soul which is already in heaven though still on
earth.&nbsp; We confess it by our own words.&nbsp; We speak of a heavenly
character; we speak even of a heavenly countenance; and we speak right.&nbsp;
We see that that character, though it be still imperfect, and marred
by human weaknesses, is already good with the goodness which comes down
from heaven; and that that countenance, though it may be mean and plain,
is already beautiful with the beauty which comes down from heaven.</p>
<p>But how are such souls recompensed in the earth?&nbsp; Oh! my friends,
is not a man recompensed in the earth whenever he can lift up his heart
above the earth?&mdash;whenever he can lift up his heart unto the Lord,
and behold His glory above all the earth?&nbsp; Does not this earth
look brighter to him then?&nbsp; The world of man looks brighter to
him, in spite of all its sins and sorrows, for he sees the Lord ruling
it, the Lord forgiving it, the Lord saving it.&nbsp; He sees, by the
eye of faith, the Lord fulfilling His own promise&mdash;&ldquo;where
two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
of them&rdquo;; and he takes heart and hope for the poor earth, and
says, The earth is not deserted; mankind is not without a Father, a
Saviour, a Teacher, a King.&nbsp; Bad men and bad spirits are not the
masters of the world; and men are not as creeping things, as the fishes
of the sea, which have no ruler over them.&nbsp; For Christ has not
left His church.&nbsp; He reigns, and will reign, till He has put all
enemies under His feet, and cast out of His kingdom all that offend,
and whatsoever loveth and maketh a lie; and then the heavenly treasure
will be the only treasure; for whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
things are true, pure, lovely, and of good report, if there be any valour,
and if there be any praise, those things, and they alone, will be left
in the kingdom of Christ and of God.&nbsp; Is not that man recompensed
in the earth?&nbsp; Must he not rise each morning to go about his daily
work with a more cheerful heart, saying, with Jeremiah, in like case,
&ldquo;Upon this I awaked, and beheld, and my sleep was sweet to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, I see in experience that the righteous man is recompensed in
the earth, every day, and all day long.&nbsp; In proportion as a man&rsquo;s
mind is heavenly, just so much will he enjoy this beautiful earth, and
all that is therein.&nbsp; I believe that if a man walks with God, then
he can walk nowhither without seeing and hearing what the ungodly and
bad man will never see and hear, because his eyes are blinded, and his
heart hardened from thinking of himself, his own selfish wants, his
own selfish sins.&nbsp; Which, for instance, was the happier man&mdash;which
the man who was the more recompensed in the earth this very day&mdash;the
poor man who went for his Sunday walk into the country, thinking of
little but the sins and the follies of the week past, and probably of
the sins and the follies of the week to come; or the man who went with
a clear conscience, and had the heart to thank God for the green grass,
and the shining river, and the misty mountains sleeping far away, and
notice the song of the birds, and the scent of the flowers, as a little
child might do, and know that his Father in heaven had made all these?</p>
<p>Yes, my friends, Christ is very near us, though our eyes are holden
by our own sins, and therefore we see Him not.&nbsp; But just in proportion
as a man walks with God, just in proportion as the eyes of his soul
are opened by the Spirit of God, he recovers, I believe, the privilege
which Adam lost when he fell.&nbsp; He hears the Word of the Lord walking
among the trees of the garden in the cool of the day; and instead of
trying, like guilty Adam, to hide himself from his Maker, answers, with
reverence and yet with joy, Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.</p>
<p>Nay, I would go further still, and say, Is not the righteous man
recompensed on the earth every time he hears a strain of noble music?&nbsp;
To him who has his treasure in heaven, music speaks about that treasure
things far too deep for words.&nbsp; Music speaks to him of whatsoever
is just, true, pure, lovely, and of good report, of whatsoever is manful
and ennobling, of whatsoever is worthy of praise and honour.&nbsp; Music,
to that man, speaks of a divine order and a divine proportion; of a
divine harmony, through all the discords and confusions of men; of a
divine melody, through all the cries and groans of sin and sorrow.&nbsp;
What says a wiser and a better man than I shall ever be, and that not
of noble music, but of such as we may hear any day in any street?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Even that vulgar music,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;which makes one
man merry, another mad, strikes in me a deep fit of devotion, and a
profound contemplation of God, the first composer.&nbsp; There is something
more of divinity in it than the ear discovers.&nbsp; It is an hieroglyphical
and shadowed lesson of the whole world, and of the creatures of God.&nbsp;
Such a melody to the ear as the whole world, well understood, would
afford to the understanding.&rdquo;&nbsp; That man, I insist, was indeed
recompensed on the earth, when music, which is to the ungodly and unrighteous
the most earthly of all arts, which to the heathens and the savages,
to frivolous and profligate persons, only tempts to silly excitement
or to brutal passion, was to him as the speech of angels, a remembrancer
to him of that eternal and ever-present heaven, from which all beauty,
truth, and goodness are shed forth over the universe, from the glory
of the ever-blessed Trinity&mdash;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Does any one say&mdash;These things are too high for me; I cannot
understand them?&nbsp; My dear friends, are they not too high for me
likewise?&nbsp; Do you fancy that I understand them, though my reason,
as well as Holy Scripture, tells me that they are true?&nbsp; I understand
them no more than I understand how I draw a single breath, or think
a single thought.&nbsp; But it is good for you, and for me, and for
every man, now and then, to hear things which we do <i>not</i> understand;
that so we may learn our own ignorance, and be lifted up above ourselves,
and renounce our fancied worldly wisdom, and think within ourselves:&mdash;Would
it not be wiser to confess ourselves fools, and take our Lord&rsquo;s
advice, and be converted, and become as little children?&nbsp; For otherwise,
our Lord says, we shall in nowise enter into this very kingdom of heaven
of which I have been telling you.&nbsp; For this is one of the things
which God hides from the wise and prudent, and yet revealeth unto babes.&nbsp;
Yes, that is the way to understand all things, however deep&mdash;to
become as little children.&nbsp; A little child proves that all I say
is true, and that it knows that all I say is true.&nbsp; Though it cannot
put its feelings into words, it acts on them by a mere instinct, which
is the gift of God.&nbsp; Why does a little child pick flowers?&nbsp;
Why does a little child dance when it hears a strain of music?&nbsp;
And deeper still, why does a little child know when it has done wrong?&nbsp;
Why does it love to hear of things beautiful and noble, and shrink from
things foul and mean, if what I say is not true?&nbsp; The child does
so, because it is nearer heaven, not further off, than we grown folk.</p>
<p>Ah! that we would all lay to heart what one said of old, who walked
with God:&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear soul, could&rsquo;st thou become a child,<br />Once more
on earth, meek, undefiled,<br />Then Paradise were round thee here,<br />And
God Himself for ever near.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON XXX.&nbsp; THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Chapel Royal</i>, <i>St James&rsquo;</i>. 1873.</p>
<p>St. Matt. xxii. 2-7.&nbsp; &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like unto
a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his
servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would
not come.&nbsp; Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them
which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and fatlings
are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.&nbsp;
But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another
to his merchandise: And the remnant took his servants, and entreated
them spitefully, and slew them.&nbsp; But when the king heard thereof,
he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers,
and burned up their city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This parable, if we understand it aright, will help to teach us theology&mdash;that
is, the knowledge of God, and of the character of God.&nbsp; For it
is a parable concerning the kingdom of heaven, and the laws and customs
of the kingdom of heaven&mdash;that is, the spiritual and eternal laws
by which God governs men.</p>
<p>Now, what any kingdom or government is like must needs depend on
what the king or governor of it is like; at least if that king is all-powerful,
and can do what he likes.&nbsp; His laws will be like his character.&nbsp;
If he be good, he will make good laws.&nbsp; If he be bad, he will make
bad laws.&nbsp; If he be harsh and cruel&mdash;if he be careless and
indulgent&mdash;so will his laws be.&nbsp; If he be loving and generous,
delighting in seeing his subjects happy, then his laws will be so shaped
that his subjects will be happy, if they obey those laws.&nbsp; But
also&mdash;and this is a very serious matter, and one to which foolish
people in all ages have tried to shut their eyes, and false preachers
in all ages have tried to blind men&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;also, I say,
if his laws be good, and bountiful, and sure to make men happy, then
the good king will have those laws obeyed.&nbsp; He will not be an indulgent
king, for in his case to be indulgent will be cruelty, and nothing less.&nbsp;
The good king will not say,&mdash;I have given you laws by which you
may live happy; but I do not care whether you obey them or not.&nbsp;
I have, as it were, set you up, in life, and given you advantages by
which you may prosper if you use them; but I do not care whether you
use them or not.&nbsp; For to say that would be as much as to say that
I do not care if you make yourselves miserable, and make others miserable
likewise.&nbsp; The good king will say,&mdash;You shall obey my laws,
for they are for your good.&nbsp; You shall use my gifts, for they are
for your good.&nbsp; And if you do not, I will punish you.&nbsp; You
shall respect my authority.&nbsp; And if you do not&mdash;if you go
too far, if you become wanton and cruel, and destroy your fellow-subjects
unjustly off the face of the earth; then I will destroy you off the
face of he earth, and burn up your city.&nbsp; I will destroy any government
or system of society which you set up in opposition to my good and just
laws.&nbsp; And if you merely despise the gifts, and refuse to use them&mdash;then
I will cast you out of my kingdom, inside which is freedom and happiness,
and light and knowledge, into the darkness outside, bound hand and foot,
into the ignorance and brutal slavery which you have chosen, where you
may reconsider yourself, weeping and gnashing your teeth as you discover
what a fool you have been.</p>
<p>Our Lord&rsquo;s parable has fulfilled itself again and again in
history, and will fulfil itself as long as foolish and rebellious persons
exist on earth.&nbsp; This is one of the laws of the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;
It must be so, for it arises by necessity out of the character of Christ,
the king of heaven.&mdash;Infinite bounty and generosity; but if that
bounty be despised and insulted, or still more, if it be outraged by
wanton tyranny or cruelty, then&mdash;for the benefit of the rest of
mankind&mdash;awful severity.&nbsp; So it is, and so it must be; simply
because God is good.</p>
<p>At least, this is the kind of king which the parable shows to us.&nbsp;
The king in it begins, not by asking his subjects to pay him taxes,
or even to do him service, but to come to a great feast&mdash;a high
court ceremonial&mdash;the marriage of his son.&nbsp; Whatsoever else
that may mean, it certainly means this&mdash;that the king intended
to treat these men, not as his slaves, but as his guests and friends.&nbsp;
They will not come.&nbsp; They are too busy; one over his farm, another
over his merchandise.&nbsp; They owe, remember, safe possession of their
farm, and safe transit for their merchandise, to the king, who governs
and guards the land.&nbsp; But they forget that, and refuse his invitation.&nbsp;
Some of them, seemingly out of mere insolence, and the spirit of rebellion
against authority, just because it is authority, go a step too far.&nbsp;
To show that they are their own masters, and intend to do what they
like, they take the king&rsquo;s messengers, and treat them spitefully,
and kill them.</p>
<p>Then there arises in that king a noble indignation.&nbsp; We do not
read that the king sentimentalised over these rebels, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;After
all, their evil, like all evil, is only a lower form of good.&nbsp;
They had a fine instinct of freedom and independence latent in them,
only it was in this case somewhat perverted.&nbsp; They are really only
to be pitied for knowing no better; but I trust, by careful education,
to bring them to a clearer sense of their own interests.&nbsp; I shall
therefore send them to a reformatory, where, in consideration of the
depressing circumstances of their imprisonment, they will be better
looked after, and have lighter work, than the average of my honest and
peaceable subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the king had spoken thus, he would
have won high applause in these days; at least till the farms and the
merchandise, the property and the profits of the rest of his subjects,
were endangered by these favoured objects of his philanthropy; who,
having found that rebellion and even murder was pardonable in one case,
would naturally try whether it was not pardonable in other cases likewise.&nbsp;
But what we read of the king&mdash;and we must really remember, in fear
and trembling, who spoke this parable, even our Lord Himself,&mdash;is
this&mdash;He sent forth his armies, soldiers, men disciplined to do
their duty at all risks, and sworn to carry out the law, and destroyed
those murderers, and burned up their city.</p>
<p>Yes, the king was very angry, as he had a right to be.&nbsp; Yes,
let us lay that to heart, and tremble, from the very worst of us all
to the very best of us all.&nbsp; There is an anger in God.&nbsp; There
is indignation in God.&nbsp; Our highest reason ought to tell us that
there must be anger in God, as long as sin and wrong exist in any corner
of the universe.&nbsp; For all that is good in man is of the likeness
of God.&nbsp; And is it not a good feeling, a noble feeling, in man,
to be indignant, or to cry for vengeance on the offender, whenever we
hear of cruelty, injustice, or violence?&nbsp; Is that not noble?&nbsp;
I say it is.&nbsp; I say that the man whose heart does not burn within
him at the sight of tyranny and cruelty, of baseness and deceit, who
is not ready to say, Take him, and do to him as he has done to others;
that man&rsquo;s heart is not right with God, or with man either.&nbsp;
His moral sense is stunted.&nbsp; He is on the way to become, first,
if he can, a tyrant, and then a slave.</p>
<p>And shall there be no noble indignation in God when He beholds all
the wrong which is done on earth?&nbsp; Shall the just and holy God
look on carelessly and satisfied at injustice and unholiness which vexes
even poor sinful man?&nbsp; God forbid!&nbsp; To think that, would,
to my mind, be to fancy God less just, less merciful, than man.&nbsp;
And if any one says, Anger is a passion, a suffering from something
outside oneself, and God can have no passions; God cannot be moved by
the sins and follies of such paltry atoms as we human beings are: the
answer is, Man&rsquo;s anger&mdash;even just anger&mdash;is, too often,
a passion; weak-minded persons, ill-educated persons, especially when
they get together in mobs, and excite each other, are carried away when
they hear even a false report of cruelty or injustice, by their really
wholesome indignation, and say and do foolish, and cruel, and unjust
things, the victims of their own passion.&nbsp; But even among men,
the wiser a man is, the purer, the stronger-minded, so much the more
can he control his indignation, and not let it rise into passion, but
punish the offender calmly, though sternly, according to law.&nbsp;
Even so, our reason bids us believe, does God, who does all things by
law.&nbsp; His eternal laws punish of themselves, just as they reward
of themselves.&nbsp; The same law of God may be the messenger of His
anger to the bad, while it is the messenger of His love to the good.&nbsp;
For God has not only no passions, but no parts; and therefore His anger
and His love are not different, but the same.&nbsp; And His love is
His anger, and His anger is His love.</p>
<p>An awful thought and yet a blessed thought.&nbsp; Think of it, my
friends&mdash;think of it day and night.&nbsp; Under God&rsquo;s anger,
or under God&rsquo;s love, we must be, whether we will or not.&nbsp;
We cannot flee from His presence.&nbsp; We cannot go from His spirit.&nbsp;
If we are loving, and so rise up to heaven, God is there&mdash;in love.&nbsp;
If we are cruel, and wrathful, and so go down to hell, God is there
also&mdash;in wrath: with the clean He will be clean, with the froward
man He will be froward.&nbsp; In God we live and move, and have our
being.&nbsp; On us, and on us alone, it depends, what sort of a life
we shall live, and whether our being shall be happy or miserable.&nbsp;
On us, and on us alone, it depends, whether we shall live under God&rsquo;s
anger, or live under God&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; On us, and on us alone,
it depends whether the eternal and unchangeable God shall be to us a
consuming fire, or light, and life, and bliss for evermore.</p>
<p>We never had more need to think of this than now; for there has spread
over the greater part of the civilised world a strong spirit of disbelief
in the living God.&nbsp; Men do not believe that God punishes sin and
wrong-doing, either in this world or in the world to come.&nbsp; And
it is not confined to those who are called infidels, who disbelieve
in the incarnation and kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Would
to God it were so!&nbsp; Everywhere we find Christians of all creeds
and denominations alike, holding the very same ruinous notion, and saying
to themselves, God does not govern this present world.&nbsp; God does
not punish or reward in this present life.&nbsp; This world is all wrong,
and the devil&rsquo;s world, and therefore I cannot prosper in the world
unless I am a little wrong likewise, and do a little of the devil&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; So one lies, another cheats, another oppresses, another
neglects his plainest social duties, another defiles himself with base
political or religious intrigues, another breaks the seventh commandment,
or, indeed, any and every one of the commandments which he finds troublesome.&nbsp;
And when one asks in astonishment&mdash;You call yourselves Christians?&nbsp;
You believe in God, and the Bible, and Christianity?&nbsp; Do you not
think that God will punish <i>you</i> for all this?&nbsp; Do you not
hear from the psalmists, and prophets, and apostles, of a God who judges
and punishes such generations as this?&nbsp; Of a wrath of God which
is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men, who, like
you, hold down the truth in unrighteousness, knowing what is right and
yet doing what is wrong?&nbsp; Then they answer, at least in their hearts,
Oh dear no!&nbsp; God does not govern men now, or judge men now.&nbsp;
He only did so, our preachers tell us, under the old Jewish dispensation;
and such words as you quote from our Lord, or St Paul, have only to
do with the day of judgment, and the next life, and we have made it
all right for the next life.&nbsp; I, says one, regularly perform my
religious duties; and I, says another, build churches and chapels, and
give large sums in charity; and I, says another, am converted, and a
member of a church; and I, says another, am elect, and predestined to
everlasting life&mdash;and so forth, and so forth.&nbsp; Each man turning
the grace of God into a cloak for licentiousness, and deluding himself
into the notion that he may break the eternal laws of God, and yet go
to heaven, as he calls it, when he dies: not knowing, poor foolish man,
that as the noble commination service well says, the dreadful judgments
of God are not waiting for certain people at the last day, thousands
of years hence, but hanging over all our heads already, and always ready
to fall on us.&nbsp; Not knowing that it is as true now as it was two
thousand years ago, that &ldquo;God is a righteous judge, strong and
patient.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If a man will not turn, He will whet His
sword; He hath bent His bow, and made it ready,&rdquo; against those
who travail with mischief, who conceive sorrow, and bring forth ungodliness.&nbsp;
They dig up pits for their neighbours, and fall themselves into the
destruction which they have made for others; not knowing that it is
as true now as it was two thousand years ago, that God is for ever saying
to the ungodly, &ldquo;Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my covenant
in thy mouth; whereas thou hatest to be reformed, and hast cast my words
behind thee?&nbsp; Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness, and with
thy tongue thou hast set forth deceit.&nbsp; These things hast thou
done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest, wickedly, that I am
even such a one as thyself.&nbsp; But I will reprove thee, and set before
thee the things which thou hast done.&nbsp; O consider this, ye that
forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be none to deliver you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us lay this to heart, and say, there can be no doubt&mdash;I
at least have none&mdash;that there is growing up among us a serious
divorce between faith and practice; a serious disbelief that the kingdom
of heaven is about us, and that Christ is ruling us, as He told us plainly
enough in His parables, by the laws of the kingdom of heaven; and that
He does, and will punish and reward each man according to those laws,
and according to nothing else.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on our superior light, and our improved civilisation,
and look down on the old Roman Catholic missionaries, who converted
our forefathers from heathendom in the Middle Ages.&nbsp; Now, I am
a Protestant, if ever there was one, and I know well that these men
had their superstitions and false doctrines.&nbsp; They made mistakes,
and often worse than mistakes, for they were but men.&nbsp; But this
I tell you, that if they had not had a deep and sound belief that they
were in the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven; and that they and
all men must obey the laws of the kingdom of heaven; and that the first
law of it was, that wrongdoing would be punished, and rightdoing rewarded,
in this life, every day, and all day long, as sure as Christ the living
Lord reigned in righteousness over all the earth; if they had not believed
that, I say, and acted on it, we should probably have been heathen at
this day.&nbsp; As it is, unless we Protestants get back the old belief,
that God is a living God, and that His judgments are abroad in the earth,
and that only in keeping His commandments can we get life, and not perish,
we shall be seriously in danger of sinking at last into that hopeless
state of popular feeling, into which more than one nation in our own
time has fallen,&mdash;that, as the prophet of old says, a wonderful
and horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets&mdash;that
is, the preachers and teachers&mdash;prophesy falsely; and the priests&mdash;the
ministers of religion&mdash;bear rule by their means; and my people
love to have it so&mdash;love to have their consciences drugged by the
news that they may live bad lives, and yet die good deaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will ye do in the end thereof?&rdquo; asks Jeremiah.&nbsp;
What indeed!&nbsp; What the Jews did in the end thereof you may read
in the book of the prophet Jeremiah.&nbsp; They did nothing, and could
do nothing&mdash;with their morality their manhood was gone.&nbsp; Sin
had borne its certain fruit of anarchy and decrepitude.&nbsp; The wrath
of God revealed itself as usual, by no miracle, but through inscrutable
social laws.&nbsp; They had to submit, cowardly and broken-hearted,
to an invasion, a siege, and an utter ruin.&nbsp; I do not say, God
forbid, that we shall ever sink so low, and have to endure so terrible
a chastisement: but this I say, that the only way in which any nation
of which I ever read in history, can escape, sooner or later, from such
a fate, is to remember every day, and all day long, that the wrath of
God is revealed from heaven against all ill-doing of men, who hold the
truth in unrighteousness, knowing what is true and what is right, yet
telling lies, and doing wrong.</p>
<p>Let us lay this to heart, with seriousness and godly fear.&nbsp;
For so we shall look up with reverence, and yet with hope, to Christ
the ascended king, to whom all power is given in heaven and earth; for
ever asking Him for His Holy Spirit, to put into our minds good desires,
and to enable us to bring these desires to good effect.&nbsp; And so
we shall live for ever under our great taskmaster&rsquo;s eye, and find
out that that eye is not merely the eye of a just judge, not merely
the eye of a bountiful king, but more the eye of a loving and merciful
Saviour, in whose presence is life even here on earth; and at whose
right hand, even in this sinful world, are pleasures for evermore.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXXI.&nbsp; THE UNCHANGEABLE CHRIST</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>. 1845.</p>
<p>Hebrews xiii. 8.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and
to-day, and for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let me first briefly remind you, as the truth upon which my whole
explanation of this text is built, that man is not meant either for
solitude or independence.&nbsp; He is meant to live <i>with</i> his
fellow-men, to live <i>by</i> them, and to live <i>for</i> them.&nbsp;
He is healthy and godly, only when he knows all men for his brothers;
and himself, in some way or other, as the servant of all, and bound
in ties of love and duty to every one around him.</p>
<p>It is not, however, my intention to dwell upon this truth, deep and
necessary as it is, but to turn your attention to one of its consequences;
I mean to the disappointment and regret of which so many complain, who
try, more or less healthily, to keep that truth before them, and shew
it forth in their daily life.</p>
<p>It has been, and is now, a common complaint with many who interest
themselves about their fellow-creatures, and the welfare of the human
race, that nothing in this world is sure,&mdash;nothing is permanent;
a continual ebb and flow seems to be the only law of human life.&nbsp;
Men change, they say; their friendships are fickle; their minds, like
their bodies, alter from day to day.&nbsp; The heart whom you trust
to-day, to-morrow may deceive; the friend for whom you have sacrificed
so much, will not in his turn endure the trial of his friendship.&nbsp;
The child on whom you may have reposed your whole affection for years,
grows up and goes forth into the world, and forms new ties, and you
are left alone.&nbsp; Why then love man?&nbsp; Why care for any born
of woman, if the happiness which depends on them is exposed to a thousand
chances&mdash;a thousand changes?&nbsp; Again; we hear the complaint
that not only men, but circumstances change.&nbsp; Why knit myself,
people will ask, to one who to-morrow may be whirled away from me by
some eddy of circumstances, and so go on his way, while I see him no
more?&nbsp; Why relieve distress which fresh accidents may bring back
again to-morrow, with all its miseries?&nbsp; Why attach ourselves to
a home which we may leave to-morrow,&mdash;to pursuits which fortune
may force us to relinquish,&mdash;to bright hopes which the rolling
clouds may shut out from us,&mdash;to opinions which the next generation
may find to have been utterly mistaken,&mdash;to a circle of acquaintances
who must in a few years be lying silent and solitary, each in his grave?&nbsp;
Why, in short, set our affections on anything in this earth, or struggle
to improve or settle aught in a world where all seems so temporary,
changeful, and uncertain, that &ldquo;nought doth endure but mutability?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is and has been the complaint, mixed up of truth and falsehood,
poured out for ages by thousands who have loved (as the world would
say) &ldquo;too well&rdquo;&mdash;who have tried to build up for themselves
homes in this world; forgetting that they were strangers and pilgrims
in it; and so, when the floods came, and swept away that small fool&rsquo;s
paradise of theirs, repined, and were astonished, as though some strange
thing had happened to them.</p>
<p>The time would fail me did I try fully to lay before you how this
dread and terror of change, and this unsatisfied craving after an eternal
home and an unchanging friendship embittered the minds of all the more
thoughtful heathens before the coming of Christ, who, as the apostle
says, all their lives were in bondage to the fear of death.&nbsp; How
all their schemes and conceptions of the course of this world, resolved
themselves into one dark picture of the terrible river of time, restless,
pitiless, devouring all life and beauty as fast as it arose, ready to
overwhelm the speakers themselves also with the coming wave, as it had
done all they loved before them, and then roll onward for ever, none
knew whither!&nbsp; The time would fail me, too, did I try to explain
how after He had appeared, Who is the same yesterday, to-day, and for
ever, men have still found the same disappointment in all the paths
of life.&nbsp; Many, not seeing that the manifestation of an incarnate
God was the answer to all such doubts, the healer of all such wounds,
have sickened at this same change and uncertainty, and attempted self-deliverance
by all kinds of uncouth and most useless methods.&nbsp; Some have shielded
themselves, or tried to shield themselves, in an armour of stoical indifference&mdash;of
utter selfishness, being sure that at all events there was one friendship
in the world which could neither change nor fade&mdash;Self-love.</p>
<p>Others, again, have withdrawn themselves in disgust, not indeed from
their God and Saviour, but from their fellow-men, and buried themselves
in deserts, hoping thereby to escape what they despaired of conquering,
the chances and changes of this mortal life.&nbsp; Thus they, alas,
threw away the gold of human affections among the dross of this world&rsquo;s
comfort and honour.&nbsp; Wiser they were, indeed, than those last mentioned;
but yet shew I you a more excellent way.</p>
<p>It is strange, and mournful, too, that this complaint, of unsatisfied
hopes and longings should still be often heard from Christian lips!&nbsp;
Strange, indeed, when the object and founder of our religion, the king
and head of all our race, the God whom we are bound to worship, the
eldest brother whom we are bound to love, the Saviour who died upon
the cross for us, is &ldquo;the same yesterday, and to-day, and for
ever!&rdquo;&nbsp; Strange, indeed, when we remember that God was manifest
in the flesh, that He might save humanity and its hopes from perpetual
change and final destruction, and satisfy all those cravings after an
immutable object of man&rsquo;s loyalty and man&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Yes, He has given us, in Himself, a king who can never misgovern,
a teacher who can never mislead, a priest whose sacrifice can never
be unaccepted, a protector who can never grow weary, a friend who can
never betray.&nbsp; And all that this earth has in it really worth loving,&mdash;the
ties of family, of country, of universal brotherhood&mdash;the beauties
and wonders of God&rsquo;s mysterious universe&mdash;all true love,
all useful labour, all innocent enjoyment&mdash;the marriage bed, and
the fireside circle&mdash;the bounties of harvest, and the smiles of
spring, and all that makes life bright and this earth dear&mdash;all
these things He has restored to man, spiritual and holy, deep with new
meaning, bright with purer enjoyment, rich with usefulness, not merely
for time, but for eternity, after they had become, through the accumulated
sin and folly of ages, foul, dead, and well nigh forgotten.&nbsp; He
has united these common duties and pleasures of man&rsquo;s life to
Himself, by taking them on Himself on earth; by giving us His spirit
to understand and fulfil those duties; by making it a duty to Him to
cultivate them to the uttermost.&nbsp; He has sanctified them for ever,
by shewing us that they are types and patterns of still higher relations
to Himself, and to His Father and our Father, from whom they came.</p>
<p>Christ our Lord and Saviour is a witness to us of the enduring, the
everlasting nature of all that human life contains of beauty and holiness,
and real value.&nbsp; He is a witness to us that Wisdom is eternal;
that that all-embracing sight, that all-guiding counsel, which the Lord
&ldquo;possessed in the beginning of His way, before His works of old,&rdquo;
He who &ldquo;was set up from everlasting,&rdquo; who was with Him when
He made the world, still exists, and ever shall exist, unchanged.&nbsp;
The word of the Lord standeth sure!&nbsp; That Word which was &ldquo;in
the beginning,&rdquo; and &ldquo;was with God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;was
God!&rdquo;&nbsp; Glorious truth! that, amid all the inventions which
man has sought out, while every new philosopher has been starting some
new method of happiness, some new theory of human life and its destinies,
God has still been working onward, unchecked, unaltered, &ldquo;the
same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; O, sons of men!
perplexed by all the apparent contradictions and cross purposes and
opposing powers and principles of this strange, dark, noisy time, remember
to your comfort that your King, a man like you, yet very God, now sits
above, seeing through all which you cannot see through; unravelling
surely all this tangled web of time, while under His guiding eye all
things are moving silently onward, like the stars in their courses above
you, toward their appointed end, &ldquo;when He shall have put down
all rule and all authority, and power, for He must reign, till He hath
put all enemies under His feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, at last, this
cloudy sky shall be all clear and bright, for He, the Lamb, shall be
the light thereof.</p>
<p>Christ is the witness to us also of the eternity of Love,&mdash;Of
God&rsquo;s love&mdash;the love of the Father who wills, of Himself
who has purchased, of the Holy Ghost who works in us our salvation;
and of the eternity of all love; that true love is not of the flesh,
but of the spirit, and therefore hath its root in the spiritual world,
above all change and accidents of time or circumstance.&nbsp; Think,
think, my friends.&nbsp; For what is life that we should make such ado
about it, and hug it so closely, and look to it to fill our hearts?&nbsp;
What is all earthly life with all its bad and good luck, its riches
and its poverty, but a vapour that passes away?&mdash;noise and smoke
overclouding the enduring light of heaven.&nbsp; A man may be very happy
and blest in this life; yet he may feel that, however pleasant it is,
at root it is no reality, but only a shadow of realities which are eternal
and infinite in the bosom of God, a piecemeal pattern, of the Light
Kingdom&mdash;the city not made with hands&mdash;eternal in the heavens.&nbsp;
For all this time-world, as a wise man says, is but like an image, beautifully
and fearfully emblematic, but still only an emblem, like an air image,
which plays and flickers in the grand, still mirror of eternity.&nbsp;
Out of nothing, into time and space we all came into noisy day; and
out of time and space into the silent night shall we all return into
the spirit world&mdash;the everlasting twofold mystery&mdash;into the
light-world of God&rsquo;s love, or the fire-world of His anger&mdash;every
like unto its like, and every man to his own place.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Choose well, your choice is<br />Brief but yet endless;<br />From
Heaven, eyes behold you<br />In eternity&rsquo;s stillness.<br />There
all is fullness,<br />Ye brave to reward you;<br />Work and despair
not.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON XXXII.&nbsp; REFORMATION LESSONS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>. 1861.</p>
<p>2 Kings xxiii. 3, 4, 25, 26.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the king stood by a
pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to &ldquo;walk after the
Lord, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes
with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this
covenant that were written in this book.&nbsp; And all the people stood
to the covenant.&nbsp; And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest,
and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to
bring forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were
made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and
he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried
the ashes of them unto Beth-el. . . .&nbsp; And like unto him was there
no king before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and
with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law
of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith
his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations
that Manasseh had provoked him withal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You heard this chapter read as the first lesson for this afternoon&rsquo;s
service; and a lesson it is indeed&mdash;a lesson for you and for me,
as it was a lesson for our forefathers.&nbsp; If you had been worshipping
in this church three hundred years ago, you would have understood, without
my telling you, why the good and wise men who shaped our prayer-book
chose this chapter to be read in church.&nbsp; You would have applied
the words of it to the times in which you were living.&nbsp; You would
have felt that the chapter spoke to you at once of joy and hope, and
of sorrow and fear.</p>
<p>There is no doubt at all what our forefathers would have thought
of, and did think of, when they read this chapter.&nbsp; The glorious
reformation which young King Josiah made was to them the pattern of
the equally glorious Reformation which was made in England somewhat
more than three hundred years ago.&nbsp; Young King Josiah, swearing
to govern according to the law of the Lord, was to them the pattern
of young King Edward VI. determining to govern according to the laws
of the Bible.&nbsp; The finding of the law of the Lord in Josiah&rsquo;s
time, after it had been long lost, was to them the pattern of the sudden
spread among them of the Bible, which had been practically hidden from
them for hundreds of years, and was then translated into English and
printed, and put freely into the hands of every man, rich and poor,
who was able to read it.&nbsp; King Josiah&rsquo;s destruction of the
idols, and the temples of the false gods, and driving out the wizards
and workers with familiar spirits, were to them a pattern of the destruction
of the monasteries and miraculous images and popish superstitions of
every kind, the turning the monks out of their convents, and forcing
them to set to honest work&mdash;which had just taken place throughout
England.&nbsp; And the hearts of all true Englishmen were stirred up
in those days to copy Josiah and the people of Jerusalem, and turn to
the Lord with all their heart, and with all their soul, and with all
their might, according to God&rsquo;s law and gospel, in the two Testaments,
both Old and New.</p>
<p>One would have thought that at such a time the hearts of our forefathers
would be full of nothing but hope and joy, content and thankfulness.&nbsp;
And yet it was not so.&nbsp; One cannot help seeing that in the prayer-book,
which was put together in those days, there is a great deal of fear
and sadness.&nbsp; You see it especially in the Litany, which was to
be said not only on Sundays, but on Wednesdays and Fridays also.&nbsp;
Some people think the Litany painfully sad&mdash;too sad.&nbsp; It was
not too sad for the time in which it was written.&nbsp; Our forefathers,
three hundred years ago, meant what they said when they cried to God
to have mercy upon them, miserable sinners, and not to remember their
offences nor the offences of their forefathers, &amp;c.&nbsp; They meant,
and had good reason to mean, what they said, when they cried to God
that those evils which the craft and subtilty of the devil and men were
working against them might be brought to nought, and by the providence
of His goodness be dispersed&mdash;to arise and help and deliver them
for His name&rsquo;s sake and for His honour; and to turn from them,
for the glory of His name, all those evils which they righteously had
deserved.&nbsp; They were in danger and in terror, our forefathers,
three hundred years ago.&nbsp; And when they heard this lesson read
in church, it was not likely to make their terror less.</p>
<p>For what says the 26th verse of this chapter?&nbsp; &ldquo;Notwithstanding,&rdquo;
in spite of all this reformation, and putting away of idols and determining
to walk according to the law of the Lord, &ldquo;the Lord turned not
from the fierceness of His great wrath, wherewith His anger was kindled
against Judah.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what followed?&nbsp; Josiah was killed
in battle&mdash;by his own fault too&mdash;by Pharaoh Nechoh, King of
Egypt.&nbsp; And then followed nothing but disaster and misery.&nbsp;
The Jews were conquered first by the King of Egypt, and taxed to pay
to him an enormous tribute; and then, in the wars between Egypt and
Babylon, conquered a second time by the King of Babylon, the famous
Nebuchadnezzar, in that dreadful siege in which it is said mothers ate
their own children through extremity of famine.&nbsp; And then after
seventy years, after every one of that idolatrous and corrupt generation
had died in captivity, the poor Jews were allowed to go back to their
native land, chastened and purged in the fire of affliction, and having
learnt a lesson which, to do them justice, they never forgot again,
and have not forgotten to this day; that to worship a graven image,
as well as to work unrighteousness, is abomination to the Lord&mdash;that
God, and God alone, is to be worshipped, and worshipped in holiness
and purity, in mercy and in justice.</p>
<p>And it was some such fate as this, some terrible ruin like that of
the Jews of old, that our forefathers feared three hundred years ago.&nbsp;
Their hearts were not yet altogether right with God.&nbsp; They had
not shaken off the bad habits of mind, or the bad morals either, which
they had learnt in the old Romish times&mdash;too many of them were
using their liberty as a cloak of licentiousness; and, under pretence
of religion, plundering not only God&rsquo;s Church, but God&rsquo;s
poor.&nbsp; And many other evils were rife in England then, as there
are sure to be great evils side by side with great good in any country
in times of change and revolution.&nbsp; And so our forefathers needed
chastisement, and they had it.&nbsp; King Edward, upon whom the Protestants
had set their hopes, died young; and then came times which tried them
literally as by fire.&nbsp; First came the terrible persecutions in
Queen Mary&rsquo;s time, when hundreds of good men and women were burnt
alive for their religion.&nbsp; And even after her death, for thirty
years, came times, such as Hezekiah speaks of&mdash;times of trouble
and rebuke and blasphemy, plots, rebellions, civil war, at home and
abroad; dangers that grew ever more and more terrible, till it seemed
at last certain that England would be conquered, in the Pope&rsquo;s
name, by the King of Spain: and if that had come to pass (and it all
but came to pass in the famous year 1588), the King of Spain would have
become King of England; the best blood of England would have been shed
upon the scaffold; the best estates parted among Spaniards and traitors;
England enslaved to the most cruel nation of those times; and the Inquisition
set up to persecute, torture, and burn all who believed in what they
called, and what is, the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; That was to have
happened, and it was only, as our forefathers confessed, by the infinite
mercy of God that it did not happen.&nbsp; They were delivered strangely
and suddenly, as the Jews were.&nbsp; For forty years they had been,
chastised, and purged and humbled for their sins; and then, and not
till then, came times of safety and prosperity, honour and glory, which
have lasted, thanks be to God, ever since.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And now, my dear friends, what has this to do with us?&nbsp; If this
chapter was a lesson to our forefathers, how is it to be a lesson to
us likewise?</p>
<p>I have always told you (as those who have really understood their
Bibles in all ages have told men) that the Bible sets forth the eternal
laws of God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;the laws by which God, that is, our
Lord Jesus Christ, governs nations and kingdoms&mdash;and not only nations
and kingdoms, but you and me, and every individual Christian man; &ldquo;all
these things,&rdquo; says St Paul, are &ldquo;written for our admonition.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The history of the Jews is, or may be, your history or mine, for good
or for evil; as God dealt with them, so is He dealing with you and me.&nbsp;
By their experience we must learn.&nbsp; By their chastisements we must
be warned.&nbsp; So says St Paul.&nbsp; So have all preachers said who
have understood St Paul&mdash;and so say I to you.&nbsp; And the lesson
that we may learn from this chapter is, that we may repent and yet be
punished.</p>
<p>I know people do not like to believe that; I know that it is much
more convenient to fancy that when a man repents, and, as he says, turns
over a new leaf, he need trouble himself no more about his past sins.&nbsp;
But it is a mistake; not only is the letter and spirit of Scripture
against him, but facts are against him.&nbsp; He may not choose to trouble
himself about his past sins; but he will find that his past sins trouble
him, whether he chooses or not,&mdash;and that often in a very terrible
way, as they troubled those poor Jews in their day, and our forefathers
after the Reformation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; some will say, &ldquo;is it not expressly written
in Scripture that &lsquo;when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness
that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he
shall save his soul alive?&rsquo; and &lsquo;all his transgressions
that he hath committed they shall not be mentioned unto him,&rsquo;
but that &lsquo;in his righteousness which he hath done he shall live?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>No doubt it is so written, my friends.&nbsp; And no doubt it is perfectly
and literally true: but answer me this, when does the wicked man do
that which is lawful and right?&nbsp; The minute after he has repented?
or the day after? or even seven years after?&mdash;the minute after
he is forgiven, and received freely back again as God&rsquo;s child,
as he will be, for the sake of that precious blood which Christ poured
out upon the cross?&nbsp; Would to God it were so, my friends.&nbsp;
Would to God it were so easy to do right, after having been accustomed
to do wrong.&nbsp; Would to God it were so easy to get a clean heart
and a right spirit.&nbsp; Would to God it were so easy to break through
all the old bad habits&mdash;perhaps the habits of a whole life-time.&nbsp;
But it is in vain to expect this sudden change of character.&nbsp; As
well may we expect a man, who has been laid low with fever, to get up
and go about to his work the moment his disease takes a favourable turn.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; After the forgiveness of sin must come the cure of sin.&nbsp;
And that cure, like most cures, is a long and a painful process.&nbsp;
The sin may have been some animal sin, like drunkenness; and we all
know how difficult it is to cure that.&nbsp; Or it may have been a spiritual
sin&mdash;pride, vanity, covetousness.&nbsp; Can any man put off these
bad habits in a moment, as he puts off his coat?&nbsp; Those who so
fancy, can know very little of human nature, and have observed their
own hearts and their fellow creatures very carelessly.&nbsp; If you
will look at facts, what you will find is this:&mdash;that all sins
and bad habits fill the soul with evil humours, just as a fever or any
other severe disease fills the body; and that, as in the case of a fever,
those evil humours remain after the acute disease is past, and are but
too apt to break out again, to cause relapses, to torment the poor patient,
perhaps to leave his character crippled and disfigured all his life&mdash;certainly
to require long and often severe treatment by the heavenly physician,
Christ, the purifier as well as the redeemer of our sin-sick souls.&nbsp;
Heavy, therefore, and bitter and shameful is the burden which many a
man has to bear after he has turned from self to God, from sin to holiness.&nbsp;
He is haunted, as it were, by the ghosts of his old follies.&nbsp; He
finds out the bitter truth of St Paul&rsquo;s words, that there is another
law in his body warring against the law of his mind, of his conscience,
and his reason; so that when he would do good, evil is present with
him.&nbsp; The good that he would do he does not do; and the evil that
he would not do he does.&nbsp; Till he cries with St Paul, &ldquo;O
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo;
and feels that none can deliver him, save Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; But there is our comfort, there is our hope&mdash;Christ,
the great healer, the great physician, can deliver us, and will deliver
us from the remains of our old sins, the consequences of our own follies.&nbsp;
Not, indeed, at once, or by miracle; but by slow education in new and
nobler motives, in purer and more unselfish habits.&nbsp; And better
for us, perhaps, that He should not cure us at once, lest we should
fancy that sin was a light thing, which we could throw off whenever
we chose; and not what it is, an inward disease, corroding and corrupting,
the wages whereof are death.&nbsp; Therefore it is, that because Christ
loves us He hates our sins, and cannot abide or endure them, will punish
them, and is merciful and loving in punishing them, as long as a tincture
or remnant of sin is left in us.</p>
<p>Let us then, if our consciences condemn us of living evil lives,
turn and repent before it be too late; before our consciences are hardened;
before the purer and nobler feelings which we learnt at our mothers&rsquo;
knees are stifled by the ways of the world; before we are hardened into
bad habits, and grown frivolous, sensual, selfish and worldly.&nbsp;
Let us repent.&nbsp; Let us put ourselves into the hands of Christ,
the great physician, and ask Him to heal our wounded souls, and purge
our corrupted souls; and leave to Him the choice of how He will do it.&nbsp;
Let us be content to be punished and chastised.&nbsp; If we deserve
punishment, let us bear it, and bear it like men; as we should bear
the surgeon&rsquo;s knife, knowing that it is for our good, and that
the hand which inflicts pain is the hand of one who so loves us, that
He stooped to die for us on the cross.&nbsp; Let Him deal with us, if
He see fit, as He dealt with David of old, when He forgave his sin,
and yet punished it by the death of his child.&nbsp; Let Him do what
He will by us, provided He does&mdash;what He will do&mdash;make us
good men.</p>
<p>That is what we need to be&mdash;just, merciful, pure, faithful,
loyal, useful, honourable with true honour, in the sight of God and
man.&nbsp; That is what we need to be.&nbsp; That is what we shall be
at last, if we put ourselves into Christ&rsquo;s hand, and ask Him for
the clean heart and the right spirit, which is His own spirit, the spirit
of all goodness.&nbsp; And provided we attain, at last, to that&mdash;provided
we attain, at last, to the truly heroic and divine life, which is the
life of virtue, it will matter little to us by what wild and weary ways,
or through what painful and humiliating processes, we have arrived thither.&nbsp;
If God has loved us, if God will receive us, then let us submit loyally
and humbly to His law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son
whom He receiveth.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON XXXIII.&nbsp; HUMAN SOOT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Preached for the Kirkdale Ragged Schools</i>, <i>Liverpool</i>,
1870.</p>
<p>St Matt, xviii. 14.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not the will of your Father
which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am here to plead for the Kirkdale Industrial Ragged School, and
Free School-room Church.&nbsp; The great majority of children who attend
this school belong to the class of &ldquo;street arabs,&rdquo; as they
are now called; and either already belong to, or are likely to sink
into, the dangerous classes&mdash;professional law-breakers, profligates,
and barbarians.&nbsp; How these children have been fed, civilized, christianized,
taught trades and domestic employments, and saved from ruin of body
and soul, I leave to you to read in the report.&nbsp; Let us take hold
of these little ones at once.&nbsp; They are now soft, plastic, mouldable;
a tone will stir their young souls to the very depths, a look will affect
them for ever.&nbsp; But a hardening process has commenced within them,
and if they are not seized at once, they will become harder than adamant;
and then scalding tears, and the most earnest trials, will be all but
useless.</p>
<p>This report contains full and pleasant proof of the success of the
schools; but it contains also full proof of a fact which is anything
but pleasant&mdash;of the existence in Liverpool of a need for such
an institution.&nbsp; How is it that when a ragged school like this
is opened, it is filled at once: that it is enlarged year after year,
and yet is filled and filled again?&nbsp; Whence comes this large population
of children who are needy, if not destitute; and who are, or are in
a fair way to become, dangerous?&nbsp; And whence comes the population
of parents whom these children represent?&nbsp; How is it that in Liverpool,
if I am rightly informed, more than four hundred and fifty children
were committed by the magistrates last year for various offences; almost
every one of whom, of course, represents several more, brothers, sisters,
companions, corrupted by him, or corrupting him.&nbsp; You have your
reformatories, your training ships, like your Akbar, which I visited
with deep satisfaction yesterday&mdash;institutions which are an honour
to the town of Liverpool, at least to many of its citizens.&nbsp; But
how is it that they are ever needed?&nbsp; How is it&mdash;and this,
if correct, or only half correct, is a fact altogether horrible&mdash;that
there are now between ten and twelve thousand children in Liverpool
who attend no school&mdash;twelve thousand children in ignorance of
their duty to God and man, in training for that dangerous class, which
you have, it seems, contrived to create in this once small and quiet
port during a century of wonderful prosperity.&nbsp; And consider this,
I beseech you&mdash;how is it that the experiment of giving these children
a fair chance, when it is tried (as it has been in these schools) has
succeeded?&nbsp; I do not wonder, of course, that it has succeeded,
for I know Who made these children, and Who redeemed them, and Who cares
for them more than you or I, or their best friends, can care for them.&nbsp;
But do you not see that the very fact of their having improved, when
they had a fair chance, is proof positive that they had not had a fair
chance before?&nbsp; How is that, my friends?</p>
<p>And this leads me to ask you plainly&mdash;what do you consider to
be your duty toward those children; what is your duty toward those dangerous
and degraded classes, from which too many of them spring?&nbsp; You
all know the parable of the Good Samaritan.&nbsp; You all know how he
found the poor wounded Jew by the wayside; and for the mere sake of
their common humanity, simply because he was a man, though he would
have scornfully disclaimed the name of brother, bound up his wounds,
set him on his own beast, led him to an inn, and took care of him.</p>
<p>Is yours the duty which the good Samaritan felt?&mdash;the duty of
mere humanity?&nbsp; How is it your duty to deal, then, with these poor
children?&nbsp; That, and I think a little more.&nbsp; Let me say boldly,
I think these children have a deeper and a nearer claim on you; and
that you must not pride yourselves, here in Liverpool, on acting the
good Samaritan, when you help a ragged school.&nbsp; We do not read
that the good Samaritan was a merchant, on his march, at the head of
his own caravan.&nbsp; We do not read that the wounded man was one of
his own servants, or a child of one of his servants, who had been left
behind, unable from weakness or weariness to keep pace with the rest,
and had dropped by the wayside, till the vultures and the jackals should
pick his bones.&nbsp; Neither do we read that he was a general, at the
head of an advancing army, and that the poor sufferer was one of his
own rank and file, crippled by wounds or by disease, watching, as many
a poor soldier does, his comrades march past to victory, while he is
left alone to die.&nbsp; Still less do we hear that the sufferer was
the child of some poor soldier&rsquo;s wife, or even of some drunken
camp-follower, who had lost her place on the baggage-waggon, and trudged
on with the child at her back, through dust and mire, till, in despair,
she dropped her little one, and left it to the mercies of the God who
gave it her.</p>
<p>In either case, that good Samaritan would have known what his duty
was.&nbsp; I trust that you will know, in like case, what your duty
is.&nbsp; For is not this, and none other, your relation to these children
in your streets, ragged, dirty, profligate, sinking and perishing, of
whom our Lord has said&mdash;&ldquo;It is not the will of your Father
which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish?&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is not His will.&nbsp; I am sure that it is not your will either.&nbsp;
I believe that, with all my heart.&nbsp; I do not blame you, or the
people of Liverpool, nor the people of any city on earth, in our present
imperfect state of civilisation, for the existence among them of brutal,
ignorant, degraded, helpless people.&nbsp; It is no one&rsquo;s fault,
just because it is every one&rsquo;s fault&mdash;the fault of the system.&nbsp;
But it is not the will of God; and therefore the existence of such an
evil is proof patent and sufficient that we have not yet discovered
the whole will of God about this matter; that we have not yet mastered
the laws of true political economy, which (like all other natural laws)
are that will of God revealed in facts.&nbsp; Our processes are hasty,
imperfect, barbaric&mdash;and their result is vast and rapid production:
but also waste, refuse, in the shape of a dangerous class.&nbsp; We
know well how, in some manufactures, a certain amount of waste is profitable&mdash;that
it pays better to let certain substances run to refuse, than to use
every product of the manufacture; as in a steam mill, where it pays
better not to consume the whole fuel, to let the soot escape, though
every atom of soot is so much wasted fuel.&nbsp; So it is in our present
social system.&nbsp; It pays better, capital is accumulated more rapidly,
by wasting a certain amount of human life, human health, human intellect,
human morals, by producing and throwing away a regular percentage of
human soot&mdash;of that thinking, acting dirt, which lies about, and,
alas! breeds and perpetuates itself in foul alleys and low public houses,
and all dens and dark places of the earth.</p>
<p>But, as in the case of the manufactures, the Nemesis comes, swift
and sure.&nbsp; As the foul vapours of the mine and the manufactory
destroy vegetation and injure health, so does the Nemesis fall on the
world of man; so does that human soot, these human poison gases, infect
the whole society which has allowed them to fester under its feet.</p>
<p>Sad, but not hopeless!&nbsp; Dark, but not without a gleam of light
on the horizon!&nbsp; For I can conceive a time when, by improved chemical
science, every foul vapour which now escapes from the chimney of a manufactory,
polluting the air, destroying the vegetation, shall be seized, utilised,
converted into some profitable substance; till the black country shall
be black no longer, the streams once more crystal clear, the trees once
more luxuriant, and the desert which man has created in his haste and
greed shall, in literal fact, once more blossom as the rose.&nbsp; And
just so can I conceive a time when, by a higher civilisation, formed
on a political economy more truly scientific, because more truly according
to the will of God, our human refuse shall be utilised, like our material
refuse, when man, as man, even down to the weakest and most ignorant,
shall be found to be (as he really is) so valuable, that it will be
worth while to preserve his health, to develop his capabilities, to
save him alive, body, intellect, and character, at any cost; because
men will see that a man is, after all, the most precious and useful
thing on the earth, and that no cost spent on the development of human
beings can possibly be thrown away.</p>
<p>I appeal, then, to you, the commercial men of Liverpool, if there
are any such in this congregation.&nbsp; If not, I appeal to their wives
and daughters, who are kept in wealth, luxury, refinement, by the honourable
labours of their husbands, fathers, brothers, on behalf of this human
soot.&nbsp; Merchants are (and I believe that they deserve to be) the
leaders of the great caravan, which goes forth to replenish the earth
and subdue it.&nbsp; They are among the generals of the great army which
wages war against the brute powers of nature all over the world, to
ward off poverty and starvation from the ever-teeming millions of mankind.&nbsp;
Have they no time&mdash;I take for granted that they have the heart&mdash;to
pick up the footsore and weary, who have fallen out of the march, that
they may rejoin the caravan, and be of use once more?&nbsp; Have they
no time&mdash;I am sure they have the heart&mdash;to tend the wounded
and the fever-stricken, that they may rise and fight once more?&nbsp;
If not, then must not the pace of their march be somewhat too rapid,
the plan of their campaign somewhat precipitate and ill-directed, their
ambulance train and their medical arrangements somewhat defective?&nbsp;
We are all ready enough to complain of waste of human bodies, brought
about by such defects in the British army.&nbsp; Shall we pass over
the waste, the hereditary waste of human souls, brought about by similar
defects in every great city in the world?</p>
<p>Waste of human souls, human intellects, human characters&mdash;waste,
saddest of all, of the image of God in little children.&nbsp; That cannot
be necessary.&nbsp; There must be a fault somewhere.&nbsp; It cannot
be the will of God that one little one should perish by commerce, or
by manufacture, any more than by slavery, or by war.</p>
<p>As surely as I believe that there is a God, so surely do I believe
that commerce is the ordinance of God; that the great army of producers
and distributors is God&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; But for that very reason
I must believe that the production of human refuse, the waste of human
character, is not part of God&rsquo;s plan; not according to His ideal
of what our social state should be; and therefore what our social state
can be.&nbsp; For God asks no impossibilities of any human being.</p>
<p>But as things are, one has only to go into the streets of this, or
any great city, to see how we, with all our boasted civilisation, are,
as yet, but one step removed from barbarism.&nbsp; Is that a hard word?&nbsp;
Why, there are the barbarians around us at every street corner!&nbsp;
Grown barbarians&mdash;it may be now all but past saving&mdash;but bringing
into the world young barbarians, whom we may yet save, for God wishes
us to save them.&nbsp; It is not the will of their Father which is in
heaven that one of them should perish.&nbsp; And for that very reason
He has given them capabilities, powers, instincts, by virtue of which
they need not perish.&nbsp; Do not deceive yourselves about the little
dirty, offensive children in the street.&nbsp; If they be offensive
to you, they are not to Him who made them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take heed that
ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in
heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is
in heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is there not in every one of them, as in you,
the Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world?&nbsp;
And know you not Who that Light is, and what He said of little children?&nbsp;
Then, take heed, I say, lest you despise one of these little ones.&nbsp;
Listen not to the Pharisee when he says, Except the little child be
converted, and become as I am, he shall in nowise enter into the kingdom
of heaven.&nbsp; But listen to the voice of Him who knew what was in
man, when He said, &ldquo;Except ye be converted, and become as little
children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Their souls are like their bodies, not perfect, but beautiful enough,
and fresh enough, to shame any one who shall dare to look down on them.&nbsp;
Their souls are like their bodies, hidden by the rags, foul with the
dirt of what we miscall civilisation.&nbsp; But take them to the pure
stream, strip off the ugly, shapeless rags, wash the young limbs again,
and you shall find them, body and soul, fresh and lithe, graceful and
capable&mdash;capable of how much, God alone who made them knows.&nbsp;
Well said of such, the great Christian poet of your northern hills&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not in entire forgetfulness,<br />And not in utter nakedness,<br />But
trailing clouds of glory do we come<br />From God, who is our home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Truly, and too truly, alas! he goes on to say&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Shades of the prison-house begin to close<br />Upon the growing
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Will you let the shades of that prison-house of mortality be peopled
with little save obscene phantoms?&nbsp; Truly, and too truly, he goes
on&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;The youth, who daily further from the east<br />Must travel,
still is Nature&rsquo;s priest,<br />And by the vision splendid,<br />Is
on his way attended.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Will you leave the youth to know nature only in the sense in which
an ape or a swine knows it; and to conceive of no more splendid vision
than that which he may behold at a penny theatre?&nbsp; Truly again,
and too truly, he goes on&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;At length the man perceives it die away,<br />And fade into
the light of common day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Yes, to weak, mortal man the prosaic age of manhood must needs come,
for good as well as for evil.&nbsp; But will you let that age be&mdash;to
any of your fellow citizens&mdash;not even an age of rational prose,
but an age of brutal recklessness; while the light of common day, for
him, has sunk into the darkness of a common sewer?</p>
<p>And all the while it was not the will of their Father in heaven that
one of these little ones should perish.&nbsp; Is it your will, my friends;
or is it not?&nbsp; If it be not, the means of saving them, or at least
the great majority of them, is easier than you think.&nbsp; Circumstances
drag downward from childhood, poor, weak, fallen, human nature.&nbsp;
Circumstances must help it upward again once more.&nbsp; Do your best
to surround the wild children of Liverpool with such circumstances as
you put round your own children.&nbsp; Deal with them as you wish God
to deal with your beloved.&nbsp; Remember that, as the wise man says,
the human plant, like the vegetable, thrives best in light; and you
will discover, by the irresistible logic of facts, by the success of
your own endeavours, by seeing these young souls grow, and not wither,
live, and not die&mdash;that it is not the will of your Father which
is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXXIV.&nbsp; NATIONAL SORROWS AND NATIONAL LESSONS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>On the illness or the Prince of Wales.</p>
<p><i>Chapel Royal</i>, <i>St James&rsquo;s</i>, <i>December</i> 17<i>th</i>,
1871.</p>
<p>2 Sam. xix. 14.&nbsp; &ldquo;He bowed the heart of all the men of
Judah, even as the heart of one man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No circumstances can be more different, thank God, than those under
which the heart of the men of Judah was bowed when their king commander
appealed to them, and those which have, in the last few days, bowed
the heart of this nation as the heart of one man.&nbsp; But the feeling
called out in each case was the same&mdash;Loyalty, spontaneous, contagious,
some would say unreasoning: but it may be all the deeper and nobler,
because for once it did not wait to reason, but was content to be human,
and to feel.</p>
<p>If those men who have been so heartily loyal of late&mdash;respectable,
business-like, manful persons, of a race in nowise given to sentimental
excitement&mdash;had been asked the cause of the intense feeling which
they have shown during the last few days, they would probably, most
of them, find some difficulty in giving it.&nbsp; Many would talk frankly
of their dread lest business should be interfered with; and no shame
to them, if they live by business.&nbsp; Others would speak of possible
political complications; and certainly no blame to them for dreading
such.&nbsp; But they would most of them speak, as frankly, of a deeper
and less selfish emotion.&nbsp; They would speak, not eloquently it
may be, but earnestly, of sympathy with a mother and a wife; of sympathy
with youth and health fighting untimely with disease and death&mdash;they
would plead their common humanity, and not be ashamed to have yielded
to that touch of nature, which makes the whole world kin.&nbsp; And
that would be altogether to their honour.&nbsp; Honourably and gracefully
has that sympathy showed itself in these realms of late.&nbsp; It has
proved that in spite of all our covetousness, all our luxury, all our
frivolity, we are not cynics yet, nor likely, thanks be to Almighty
God, to become cynics; that however encrusted and cankered with the
cares and riches of this world, and bringing, alas, very little fruit
to perfection, the old British oak is sound at the root&mdash;still
human, still humane.</p>
<p>But there is, I believe, another and an almost deeper reason for
the strong emotion which has possessed these men; one most intimately
bound up with our national life, national unity, national history; one
which they can hardly express to themselves; one which some of them
are half ashamed to express, because they cannot render a reason for
it; but which is still there, deeply rooted in their souls; one of those
old hereditary instincts by which the histories of whole nations, whole
races, are guided, often half-unconsciously, and almost in spite of
themselves; and that is Loyalty, pure and simple Loyalty&mdash;the attachment
to some royal race, whom they conceived to be set over them by God.&nbsp;
An attachment, mark it well, founded not on their own will, but on grounds
very complex, and quite independent of them; an attachment which they
did not make, but found; an attachment which their forefathers had transmitted
to them, and which they must transmit to their children as a national
inheritance,&mdash;at once a symbol of and a support to the national
unity of the whole people, running back to the time when, in dim and
mythic ages, it emerged into the light of history as a wandering tribe.&nbsp;
This instinct, as a historic fact, has been strong in all the progressive
European nations; especially strong in the Teutonic; in none more than
in the English and the Scotch.&nbsp; It has helped to put them in the
forefront of the nations.&nbsp; It has been a rallying point for all
their highest national instincts.&nbsp; Their Sovereign was to them
the divinely appointed symbol of the unity of their country.&nbsp; In
defending him, they defended it.&nbsp; It did not interfere, that instinct
of loyalty, with their mature manhood, freedom, independence.&nbsp;
They knew that if royalty were indeed God&rsquo;s ordinance, it had
its duties as well as its rights.&nbsp; And when their kings broke the
law, they changed their kings.&nbsp; But a king they must have, for
their own sakes; not merely for the sake of the nation&rsquo;s security
and peace, but for the sake of their own self-respect.&nbsp; They felt,
those old forefathers of ours, that loyalty was not a degrading, but
an ennobling influence; that a free man can give up his independence
without losing it; that&mdash;as the example of that mighty German army
has just shown an astounded world&mdash;independence is never more called
out than by subordination; and that a free man never feels himself so
free as when obeying those whom the laws of his country have set over
him; an able man never feels himself so able as when he is following
the lead of an abler man than himself.&nbsp; And what if, as needs must
happen at whiles, the sovereign were not a man, but a woman or a child?&nbsp;
Then was added to loyalty in the hearts of our forefathers, and of many
another nation in Europe, an instinct even deeper, and tenderer, and
more unselfish&mdash;the instinct of chivalry; and the widowed queen,
or the prince, became to them a precious jewel committed to their charge
by the will of their forefathers and the providence of God; an heirloom
for which they were responsible to God, and to their forefathers, and
to their children after them, lest their names should be stained to
all future generations by the crime of baseness toward the weak.</p>
<p>This was the instinct of the old Teutonic races.&nbsp; They were
often unfaithful to it&mdash;as all men are to their higher instincts;
and fulfilled it very imperfectly&mdash;as all men fulfil their duties.&nbsp;
But it was there&mdash;in their heart of hearts.&nbsp; It helped to
make them; and, therefore, it helped to make us.&nbsp; It ennobled them;
it called out in them the sense of unity, order, discipline, and a lofty
and unselfish affection.&nbsp; And I thank God, as an Englishman, for
any event, however exquisitely painful, which may call out those true
graces in us, their descendants.&nbsp; And, therefore, my good friends,
if any cynic shall sneer, as he may, after the present danger is past,
at this sudden outburst of loyalty, and speak of it as unreasoning and
childish, answer not him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give not that which is holy unto
the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample
them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
answer yourselves, and answer too your children, when they ask you what
has moved you thus&mdash;answer, I say, not childishly, but childlike:
&ldquo;We have gone back, for a moment at least, to England&rsquo;s
childhood&mdash;to the mood of England when she was still young.&nbsp;
And we are showing thereby that we are not yet decayed into old age.&nbsp;
That if we be men, and not still children, yet the child is father to
the man; and the child&rsquo;s heart still beats underneath all the
sins and all the cares and all the greeds of our manhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than one foreign nation is looking on in wonder and in envy
at that sight.&nbsp; God grant that they may understand all that it
means.&nbsp; God grant that they may understand of how wide and deep
an application is the great law, &ldquo;Except ye be converted,&rdquo;
changed, and turned round utterly, &ldquo;and become as little children,
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; God grant
that they may recover the childlike heart, and replace with it that
childish heart which pulls to pieces at its own irreverent fancy the
most ancient and sacred institutions, to build up ever fresh baby-houses
out of the fragments, as a child does with its broken toys.</p>
<p>Therefore, my friends, be not ashamed to have felt acutely.&nbsp;
Be not ashamed to feel acutely still, till all danger is past, or even
long after all danger is past; when you look back on what might have
been, and what it might have brought, ay, must have brought, if not
to you, still to your children after you.&nbsp; For so you will show
yourselves worthy descendants of your forefathers: so you will show
yourselves worthy citizens of this British empire.&nbsp; So you will
show yourselves, as I believe, worthy Christian men and women.&nbsp;
For Christ, the King of kings and subjects, sends all sorrow, to make
us feel acutely.&nbsp; We do not, the great majority of us, feel enough.&nbsp;
Our hearts are dull and hard and light, God forgive us; and we forget
continually what an earnest, awful world we live in&mdash;a whole eternity
waiting for us to be born, and a whole eternity waiting to see what
we shall do now we are born.&nbsp; Yes; our hearts are dull and hard
and light; and, therefore, Christ sends suffering on us to teach us
what we always gladly forget in comfort and prosperity&mdash;what an
awful capacity of suffering we have; and more, what an awful capacity
of suffering our fellow-creatures have likewise.&nbsp; We sit at ease
too often in a fool&rsquo;s paradise, till God awakens us and tortures
us into pity for the torture of others.&nbsp; And so, if we will not
acknowledge our brotherhood by any other teaching, He knits us together
by the brotherhood of common suffering.</p>
<p>But if God thus sends sorrow to ennoble us, to call out in us pity,
sympathy, unselfishness, most surely does He send for that end such
a sorrow as this, which touches in all alike every source of pity, of
sympathy, of unselfishness at once.&nbsp; Surely He meant to bow our
hearts as the heart of one man; and He has, I trust and hope, done that
which He meant to do.&nbsp; God grant that the effect may be permanent.&nbsp;
God grant that it may call out in us all an abiding loyalty.&nbsp; God
grant that it may fill us with some of that charity which bears all
things, hopes all things, believes all things, which rejoices not in
iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; and make us thrust aside henceforth,
in dignified disgust, the cynic and the slanderer, the ribald and the
rebel.</p>
<p>But more.&nbsp; God grant that the very sight of the calamity with
which we have stood face to face, may call out in us some valiant practical
resolve, which may benefit this whole nation, and bow all hearts as
the heart of one man, to do some one right thing.&nbsp; And what right
thing?&nbsp; What but the thing which is pointed to by plain and terrible
fact, as the lesson which God must mean us to learn, if He means us
to learn any, from what has so nearly befallen?&nbsp; Let our hearts
be bowed as the heart of one man, to say&mdash;that so far as we have
power, so help us God, no man, woman, or child in Britain, be he prince
or be he beggar, shall die henceforth of preventable disease.&nbsp;
Let us repent of and amend that scandalous neglect of the now well-known
laws of health and cleanliness which destroys thousands of lives yearly
in this kingdom, without need and reason; in defiance alike of science,
of humanity, and of our Christian profession.&nbsp; Two hundred thousand
persons, I am told, have died of preventable fever since the Prince
Consort&rsquo;s death ten years ago.&nbsp; Is that not a sin to bow
our hearts as the heart of one man?&nbsp; Ah, if this foul and needless
disease, by striking once at the very highest, shall bring home to us
the often told, seldom heeded fact that it is striking perpetually at
hundreds among the very lowest, whom we leave to sicken and die in dens
unfit for men&mdash;unfit for dogs; if this tragedy shall awaken all
loyal citizens to demand and to enforce, as a duty to their sovereign,
their country, and their God, a sanatory reform in town and country,
immediate, wholesale, imperative; if it shall awaken the ministers of
religion to preach about that, and hardly aught but that&mdash;till
there is not a fever ally or a malarious ditch left in any British city;&mdash;then
indeed this fair and precious life will not have been imperilled in
vain, and generations yet unborn will bless the memory of a prince who
sickened as poor men sicken, and all but died, as poor men die, that
his example&mdash;and, it may be hereafter, his exertions&mdash;might
deliver the poor from dirt, disease, and death.</p>
<p>For him himself I have no fear.&nbsp; We have committed him to God.&nbsp;
It may be that he has committed himself to God.&nbsp; It may be that
he has already learned lessons which God alone can teach.&nbsp; It may
be that those lessons will bring forth hereafter royal fruit right worthy
of a royal root.&nbsp; At least we can trust him in God&rsquo;s hands,
and believe that if this great woe was meant to ennoble us it was meant
to ennoble him; that if it was meant to educate us it was meant to educate
him; that God is teaching him; and that in God&rsquo;s school-house
he is safe.&nbsp; For think, my friends, if we, who know him partly,
love him much; then God, who knows him wholly, loves him more.&nbsp;
And so God be with him, and with you, and with your prayers for him.&nbsp;
Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXXV.&nbsp; GRACE AND GLORY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Chapel Royal</i>, <i>Whitehall</i>. 1865.&nbsp; For the consumptive
hospital.</p>
<p>St John ii. 11.&nbsp; &ldquo;This beginning of miracles did Jesus
in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This word glory, whether in its Greek or its Roman shape, had a very
definite meaning in the days of the Apostles.&nbsp; It meant the admiration
of men.&nbsp; The Greek word, as every scholar knows, is derived from
a root signifying to seem, and expresses that which a man seems, and
appears to his fellow men.&nbsp; The Latin word glory is expressly defined
by Cicero to mean the love, trust, and admiration of the multitude;
and a consequent opinion that the man is worthy of honour.&nbsp; Glory,
in fact, is a relative word, and can be only used of any being in relation
to other rational beings, and their opinion of him.</p>
<p>The glory of God, therefore, in Scripture, must needs mean that admiration
which men feel, or ought to feel for God.&nbsp; There is a deeper, an
altogether abysmal meaning for that word: &ldquo;And now, O Father,
glorify thou me with thy own self, with the glory which I had with thee
before the world was.&rdquo;&nbsp; But on that text, speaking of the
majesty of the ever-blessed Trinity, I dare not attempt to comment;
though, could I explain it, I should.&nbsp; When St. John says that
Christ manifested forth His glory, and His disciples believed on Him,
it is plain that He means by His glory that which produced admiration
and satisfaction, not alone in the mind of God the Father, but in the
minds of men.</p>
<p>Now, what the Romans thought glorious in their days is notorious
enough.&nbsp; No one can look upon the picture of a Roman triumph without
seeing that their idea of glory was force, power, brute force, self-willed
dominion, selfish aggrandizement.&nbsp; But this was not the glory which
St. John saw in Christ, for His glory was full of grace, which is incompatible
with self-will and selfishness.</p>
<p>The Greek&rsquo;s meaning of glory is equally notorious.&nbsp; He
called it wisdom.&nbsp; We call it craft&mdash;the glory of the sophist,
who could prove or disprove anything for gain or display; the glory
of the successful adventurer, whose shrewdness made its market out of
the stupidity and vice of the barbarian.&nbsp; But this is not the glory
of Christ, for St. John saw that it was full of truth.</p>
<p>Therefore, neither strength nor craft are the glory of Christ; and,
therefore, they are not the glory of God.&nbsp; For the glory of Christ
is the glory of God, and none other, because He is very God, of very
God begotten.&nbsp; In Christ, man sees the unseen, and absolute, and
eternal God as He is, was, and ever will be.&nbsp; &ldquo;No man hath
seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of
the Father, He hath declared Him:&rdquo;&mdash;and that perfectly and
utterly; for in Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, so
that He Himself could say, &ldquo;He that hath seen me hath seen the
Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the Catholic Faith.&nbsp; God grant that
I may believe it with my whole heart.&nbsp; God grant that you may believe
it with your whole hearts likewise, and not merely with your intellects
and brains.</p>
<p>But, it may be said, though God be not glorious and admirable for
selfish force, which it were blasphemous to attribute to Him, He is
still admirable for His power.&nbsp; Though He be not glorious for craft,
He is still glorious for His wisdom.&nbsp; I deny both.&nbsp; I deny
that power is any object of admiration, unless it be used well for good
ends.&nbsp; To admire power for its own sake is one of those errors,
which has been well called Titanolatry, the worship of giants.&nbsp;
Neither is wisdom an object of admiration, unless it be used for good
ends.&nbsp; To worship it for its own sake is a common error enough&mdash;the
idolatry of Intellect.&nbsp; But it is none the less an error, and a
grievous one.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s power and wisdom are glorious only in
as far as they are used (as they are utterly) for good ends; only, in
plain words, as far as God is (as He is perfectly) good.&nbsp; And the
true glory of God is that God is good.&nbsp; So says the Scripture;
and so I bid you all remember, for it is a truth which you and I and
all mankind are perpetually ready to forget.</p>
<p>Let me but ask you one question as a test whether or not I am right.&nbsp;
If the Supreme Being used His power, as the Roman C&aelig;sar used his;
if He used His wisdom as the Greek sophist used his, would He be glorious
then and worthy of admiration?&nbsp; The old heathen &AElig;schylus
answered that question for mankind long ago on the Athenian stage.&nbsp;
I should be ashamed to answer it again in a Christian pulpit.&nbsp;
And when I say <i>good</i>, I mean good, even as man can be, and ought
to be, and is, more or less, good.&nbsp; The theory that because God&rsquo;s
morality is absolute, it may, therefore, be different from man&rsquo;s
morality, in <i>kind</i> as well as in <i>degree</i>, is equally contrary
to the letter and to the spirit of Scripture.&nbsp; Man, according to
Scripture, is made in God&rsquo;s moral image and likeness, and however
fallen and degraded that image may be, still the ultimate standard of
right and wrong is the same in God and in man.&nbsp; How else dare Abraham
ask of God, &ldquo;Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&rdquo;&nbsp;
How else has God&rsquo;s command to the old Jews any meaning, &ldquo;Be
ye holy, for I am holy?&rdquo;&nbsp; How else have all the passages
in the Psalms, Prophets, Evangelists, Apostles, which speak of God&rsquo;s
justice, mercy, faithfulness, any honest or practical meaning to human
beings?&nbsp; How else can they be aught but a mockery, a delusion,
and a snare to the tens of thousands who have found in them hope and
trust, that God would deliver them and the world from evil?&nbsp; What
means the command to be perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect?&nbsp;
What mean the words that we partake of a divine nature?&nbsp; How else
is the command to love God anything but an arbitrary and impossible
demand,&mdash;demanding love, which every writer of fiction tells you,
and tells you truly, cannot be compelled&mdash;can only go forth toward
a being who shows himself worthy of our love, by possessing those qualities
which we admire in our fellow men?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Against such a theory
I must quote, as embodying all that I would say, and corroborating,
on entirely independent ground, the Scriptural account of human morality&mdash;against
such a theory, I say I must quote the words of our greatest living logician.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Language has no meaning for the words Just, Merciful, Benevolent&rdquo;
(he might have added truthful likewise) &ldquo;save that in which we
predicate them of our fellow creatures; and unless that is what we intend
to express by them, we have no business to employ the words.&nbsp; If
in affirming them of God we do not mean to affirm these very qualities,
differing only as greater in degree, we are neither philosophically
nor morally entitled to affirm them at all . . .&nbsp; What belongs
to&rdquo; God&rsquo;s goodness &ldquo;as Infinite (or more properly
Absolute) I do not pretend to know; but I know that infinite goodness
must be goodness, and that what is not consistent with goodness is not
consistent with infinite goodness. . . . Besides,&rdquo; he says&mdash;and
to this sound <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> I call the attention of all
who believe their Bibles&mdash;&ldquo;unless I believe God to possess
the same moral attributes which I find, in however inferior a degree,
in a good man, what ground of assurance have I of God&rsquo;s veracity?&nbsp;
All trust in a Revelation presupposes a conviction that God&rsquo;s
attributes are the same, in all but degree, with the best human attributes.&nbsp;
If, instead of the &lsquo;glad tidings&rsquo; that there exists a Being
in whom all the excellences which the highest human mind can conceive,
exist in a degree inconceivable to us, I am informed that the world
is ruled by a being whose attributes are infinite, but what they are
we cannot learn, nor what are the principles of his government, except
that &lsquo;the highest human morality which we are capable of conceiving&rsquo;
does not sanction them; convince me of it and I will bear my fate as
I may.&nbsp; But when I am told that I must believe this, and at the
same time call this being by the names which express and affirm the
highest human morality, I say in plain terms that I will not.&nbsp;
Whatever power such a being may have over me, there is one thing which
he shall not do: he shall not compel me to worship him.&nbsp; I will
call no being good, who is not what I mean when I apply that epithet
to my fellow creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That St. John would have assented to these bold and honest words,
that such is St. John&rsquo;s conception of human and divine morality,
the story in the text shows, to my mind, especially.&nbsp; It is, so
to speak, a crucial experiment, by which the truth of the Scripture
theory is verified.&nbsp; The difficulty in all ages about a standard
of morality has been&mdash;How can we fix it?&nbsp; Even if we agree
that man&rsquo;s goodness ought to be the counterpart of God&rsquo;s
goodness, we know that in practice it is not, as mankind has differed
in all ages and countries about what is right and wrong.&nbsp; The Hindoo
thinks it right to burn widows, wrong to eat animal food; and between
such extremes there are numberless minor differences.&nbsp; Hardly any
act is conceivable which has not been thought by some man, somewhere,
somehow, morally right or morally wrong.&nbsp; If all that we can do
is, to choose out those instances of morality which seem to us most
right, and impute them to God, shall we not have an ever-shifting, probably
a merely conventional standard of right and wrong?&nbsp; And worse&mdash;shall
we not be always in danger of deifying our own superstitions&mdash;perhaps
our own vices: of making a God in our own image, because we cannot know
that God in whose image we are made?&nbsp; Most true, unless &ldquo;we
believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; &ldquo;perfect
God and perfect man.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Him, says the Bible, the perfect
human morality is manifested, and shown by His life and conduct to be
identical with the divine.&nbsp; He bids us be perfect even as our Father
in heaven is perfect; and He only has a right&mdash;in the sense of
a sound and fair reason&mdash;for so doing; because He can say, and
has said, &ldquo;He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At least, such is the doctrine of St. John.&nbsp; He tells us that
the Word, who was God, was made flesh, and dwelt in his land and neighbourhood;
and that he and his fellows beheld His glory; and saw that it was the
glory of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.&nbsp;
And then, in the next chapter, he goes on to tell us how that glory
was first manifested forth&mdash;by turning water into wine at a marriage
feast.&nbsp; On the truth of the story, I say simply, in passing, that
I believe it fully and literally; as I do also St. John&rsquo;s assertions
about our Lord&rsquo;s Divinity.&nbsp; But I only wish to point out
to you why I called this miracle the crucial experiment, which proved
God&rsquo;s goodness to be identical with that which we call (and rightly)
goodness in man.&nbsp; It is by the seeming insignificance thereof,
by the seeming non-necessity, by the seeming humbleness of its circumstances,
by the seeming smallness of its results, issuing merely (as far as Scripture
tells us, and therefore as far as we need know, or have a right to imagine)
in the giving of a transitory and unnecessary physical pleasure.&nbsp;
In short, by the very absence of that <i>Dignus deo vindice nodus</i>,
that knot which only a God could untie, which heathens demanded ere
a god was allowed to interfere in the plot of a tragedy; which too many
who call themselves Christians demand before the living God is allowed
to interfere in that world in which without Him not a sparrow falls
to the ground.&nbsp; In a moral case of this kind, if you will consider,
that which seems least is often the greatest.&nbsp; That which seems
the lowest, because the simplest and meanest manifestation of a moral
law, may be&mdash;probably is&mdash;the deepest, the highest, the most
universal.</p>
<p>Life is made up of little things, say the practically wise, and they
say true, for our Lord says so likewise.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that is faithful
in that which is least is faithful also in much.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you
look on morality, virtue, goodness, holiness, sanctification&mdash;call
it what you will&mdash;as merely the obligation of an <i>external</i>
law, you will be tempted to say, &ldquo;Let me be faithful to it in
its greater and more important cases, and that is enough.&nbsp; The
pettier ones must take care of themselves, I have not time enough to
attend to them, and God will not, it may be, require them of me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But if the morality, goodness, holiness be in you what it was in Christ,
without measure&mdash;a <i>spirit</i>, even the spirit of God&mdash;a
spirit within you, possessing you, and working on you, and in you&mdash;then
that which seems most petty and unimportant will often be most important,
the test of the soundness of your heart, of the reality of your feelings.</p>
<p>We all know&mdash;every writer of fiction, at least, should know&mdash;how
true this is in the case of love between man and woman, between parent
and child: how the little kindnesses, the half-unconscious gestures,
the petty labours of love, of which their object will never be aware,
the scrupulousness which is able &ldquo;to greatly find quarrel in a
straw, when honour is at stake,&rdquo;&mdash;how these are the very
things which show that the affection is neither the offspring of dry
and legal duty, nor of selfish enjoyment, but lies far down in the unconscious
abysses of the heart and being itself:&mdash;as Christ&mdash;to compare
(for He Himself permits, nay commands, us to do so in His parables)
our littleness with His immensity&mdash;as Christ, I say, showed, when
He chose first to manifest His glory&mdash;the glory of His grace and
truth&mdash;by increasing for a short hour the pleasures of a village
feast.</p>
<p>I might say much more on the point; how He showed these by His truth;
how He proved that He, and therefore His Father and your Father, was
not that <i>Deus quidam deceptor</i>, whom some suppose Him, mocking
the intellect of His creatures by the <i>facts</i> of nature which He
has created, tempting the souls of His creatures by the very faculties
and desires which He Himself has given them.</p>
<p>But I wish now to draw your minds rather to that one word <i>Grace</i>&mdash;Grace,
what it means, and how it is a manifestation of glory.&nbsp; Few Scriptural
expressions have suffered more that this word Grace from the storms
of theological controversy.&nbsp; Springing flesh in the minds of Apostles,
as did many other noble words in that heaven-enriched soil, the only
adequate expressions of an idea which till then had never fully possessed
the mind of man, it meant more than we can now imagine; perhaps more
that we shall ever imagine again.&nbsp; We, alas! only know the word
with its fragrance battered out, its hues rubbed off, its very life
anatomized out of it by the battles of rival divines, till its mere
skeleton is left, and all that grace means to most of us is simply and
dryly a certain spiritual gift of God.&nbsp; Doubtless it means that;
but if it meant nothing more at first, why was not the plain word Gift
enough for the Apostles?&nbsp; Why did they use Grace?&nbsp; Why did
they use, too, in the sense of giving and gifts, nouns and verbs derived
from that root-word, <i>charis</i>, grace, which plainly signified so
much to them?&nbsp; A word, the root-meaning of which was neither more
nor less than a certain heathen goddess, or goddesses&mdash;the inspirer
of beauty in art, the impersonation of all that is pure, charming, winning,
bountiful&mdash;in one word, of all that is graceful and gracious in
the human character.&nbsp; The fact is strange, but the fact is there;
and being there, we must face it and explain it.&nbsp; Of course, the
Apostles use the word grace in a far deeper and loftier meaning; raise
it, mathematically speaking, to a far higher power.&nbsp; There is no
need to remind you of that.&nbsp; But why did they choose and use the
word at all&mdash;a word whose old meaning every heathen knew&mdash;unless
for some innate fitness in it to express something in the character
of God?&nbsp; To tell men that there was in God a graciousness, as of
the most gracious of all human beings, which gave to His character a
moral beauty, a charm, a winningness, which, as even the old Jewish
prophet, before the Incarnation, could perceive and boldly declare,
drew them with the cords of a man and with the bands of love, attracting
them by the very human character of its graciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Meditate on those words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Full of grace,&rdquo;&mdash;of
that spirit which we, like the old heathens, consider rather a feminine
than a masculine excellence; the spirit, which, as St. James says of
God the Father, gives simply and upbraideth not; gives gracefully, as
we ourselves say&mdash;in the right and happy use of the adverb; does
not spoil its gifts by throwing them in the teeth of the giver, but
gives for mere giving&rsquo;s sake; pleases where it can be done, without
sin or harm, for mere pleasing&rsquo;s sake; most human and humane when
it is most divine; the spirit by which Christ turned the water into
wine at the marriage feast, and so manifested forth His absolute and
eternal glory.&nbsp; And how?&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>Thus, if you will receive it; if you will believe a truth which is
too often hidden from the wise and prudent, and yet revealed unto babes;
which will never be understood by the proud Pharisee, the sour fanatic,
the ascetic who dreads and distrusts his Father in heaven; but which
is clear and simple enough to many a clear and simple heart, honest
and single-eyed, sunny itself, and bringing sunshine wherever it comes,
because it is inspired by the gracious spirit of God, and delights to
show kindness for kindness&rsquo; sake, and to make happy for happiness&rsquo;
sake, taking no merit to itself for doing that, which is as instinctive
as its very breath.</p>
<p>This,&mdash;that the graciousness which Christ showed at that marriage
feast is neither more nor less than the boundless love of God, who could
not live alone in the abyss, but must needs, out of His own Divine Charity,
create the universe, that He might have somewhat beside Himself whereon
to pour out the ocean of His love, which finds its own happiness in
giving happiness to all created things, from the loftiest of rational
beings down to the gnat which dances in the sun, and for aught we know,
to the very lichen which nestles in the Alpine rock.</p>
<p>This is the character of God, unless Scripture be a dream of man&rsquo;s
imagination.&nbsp; Thus far you may know God; thus far you may see God
as He is; and know and see that He is just with the justice of a man,
only more just; merciful with the mercy of a man, only more merciful;
truthful with the truthfulness of a man, only more truthful; gracious
with the graciousness of a man, only more gracious; and loving?&nbsp;
That we dare not say: for if we say so much, the Scripture commands
us to say more.&nbsp; The Scripture tells us that the whole absolute
morality of God is summed up&mdash;as our own human morality ought to
be&mdash;in His Love.&nbsp; That love is the fulfilment of the Moral
Law in Him as in us; that it is the root and cause and spirit of His
justice, mercy, truth, and graciousness; that it belongs not to His
attributes, as they may be said to be, but to His essence and His spirit;
that we must not, if we be careful of our words, say, God is loving,
because we are bidden to say, &ldquo;God is Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, the commands, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God&mdash;and thy
neighbour as thyself, are shown to be not arbitrary and impossible demands,
miscalled moral obligations, while they are merely legal and external
ones; but true moral obligations, in the moral sense, to which heart
and spirit can answer, &ldquo;I rejoice to do thy will, O God; Thy law
is within my heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; You ought to love God, because He is
supremely loveable and worthy of your love.&nbsp; You can love God,
because you can appreciate and know God; for you are His child, made
in His moral likeness, and capable of seeing Him as He is morally, and
of seeing in Him the full perfection of all that attracts your moral
sense, when it is manifested in any human being.&nbsp; And you can love
your neighbour as yourselves, because, and in as far as you have in
you the Spirit of God, the spirit of universal love, which proceedeth
out for ever both from the Father and the Son to all beings and things
which They have made.</p>
<p>And of one thing I am sure, that in proportion as you are led and
inspired by that Spirit of God which showed in our Lord, in the very
deepest and truest sense, as the spirit of humanity, just so you will
feel a genial and hearty pleasure in lessening all human suffering,
however slight; in increasing all harmless human pleasure, however transitory;
and in copying Him who, at the marriage feast, gracefully and graciously
turned the water into wine.&nbsp; I do not, of course, mean that you
are to do no more than that; to prefer sentiment to duty, to amuse and
glorify yourselves by paying tithe of mint, anise, and cummin, and neglect
the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith.&nbsp;
But I do mean that you are not to distrust your own sentiments, not
to crush your own instinctive sympathies.&nbsp; The very lowest of them&mdash;that
which makes you shrink at the sight of pain, and rejoice in the sight
of pleasure, is not natural, and common to you with the animals; it
is supernatural and divine.&nbsp; It is a schoolmaster to bring you
to Christ, to that higher inspiration of His, which tells your heart
to alleviate the unseen woes which will never come into painful contact
with your sensibilities, to bestow pleasures in which you yourself have
no immediate share.&nbsp; It will tell your hearts especially in the
case of this very Hospital for Consumption not to be slack in giving,
because so much of what you will give&mdash;it is painful to recollect
how much&mdash;will be spent, not in prevention, not even in cure, but
in mere alleviation, mere increased bodily ease, mere savoury food,
even mere passing amusements for wearied minds.&nbsp; Be it so.&nbsp;
If (which God forbid) we could do nothing <i>save</i> alleviate; if
(which God forbid) permanent cure, even lengthening of life, were impossible,
I should say just as much, Give.&nbsp; Give money to alleviate; give,
even though what you give were, in the strictly economic sense, <i>wasted</i>.&nbsp;
We are ready enough, most of us, to waste upon ourselves.&nbsp; It is
well for us to taste once in a way the luxury of wasting on others;
though I have yet to learn that anything can be called wasted which
lessens, even for a moment, the amount of human suffering.&nbsp; A plan,
for instance, is on foot for sending twenty of the patients to Madeira
for the winter.&nbsp; The British Consul, to his honour, guarantees
their maintenance, if the Hospital will pay their passage out and home.&nbsp;
Some may say&mdash;An unnecessary expense&mdash;a problematical benefit.&nbsp;
Be it so.&nbsp; I believe that it will not be such; that it may save
many lives&mdash;they may revive: but were it not so, I would still
say Give.&nbsp; Let them go, even if every soul in that ship were doomed.&nbsp;
Let them go.&nbsp; Let them drink the fresh sea breeze before they die;
let them see the green tropic world; let them forget their sorrow for
a while; let them feel springing up afresh in them the celestial fount
of hope.&nbsp; We let the guilty criminal eat and drink well the morn
ere he is led forth to die&mdash;shall we not do as much by those who
are innocent?</p>
<p>But especially would I say, try to lessen such suffering as that
for which I plead to-day, because it is undeserved in the true sense
of that word&mdash;not earned by any act of their own.&nbsp; These poor
souls suffer for no sins of their own; they have done nothing to bring
on themselves a disease which attacks too often the fairest, the seemingly
strongest and healthiest, the most temperate and most pure.&nbsp; They
suffer, some it may be for the sins of their forefathers, some from
causes of disease which science cannot as yet control, cannot even discover.&nbsp;
They are objects of unmixed pity and sympathy: they should be so to
us; for they are so to Him who made them.&nbsp; On this disease God
does bestow a special alleviation&mdash;a special mark of His pity,
of His tenderness, in a word of His grace.&nbsp; That unclouded intellect,
that unruffled temper, that cheerful resignation, that brave and yet
calm facing of the inevitable future, that ever-fresh hope, which is
no delusion but a token that God Himself has taken away the sting of
death and the victory of the grave, till the very thought of death has
vanished, or is looked on merely as the gate to a life of health, and
strength, and peace, and joy:&mdash;all these symptoms, so common, so
normal, all but universal&mdash;this Euthanasia which God has provided
for those who, humanly speaking, are innocent, yet must, for the general
good of humanity, leave this world for another;&mdash;what are they
but the voice of God to us, telling that He loves, that He pities, that
He alleviates; and bidding us go and do likewise?&nbsp; God has alleviated
where we cannot.&nbsp; He has bidden us thereby, if His likeness and
spirit be indeed in us, to alleviate where we can; and believe that
by every additional comfort, however petty, which we provide, we are
copying the Ideal Man, who, because He was very God of very God, could
condescend, at the marriage feast, to turn the water into wine.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXXVI.&nbsp; USELESS SACRIFICE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Preached at Southsea for the Mission of the Good Shepherd.&nbsp;
<i>October</i> 1871.</p>
<p>Isaiah i. 11-17.&nbsp; &ldquo;To what purpose is the multitude of
your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord: . . .&nbsp; When ye come to
appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?&nbsp;
Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new
moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it
is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.&nbsp; Your new moons and your
appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble to me; I am weary
to bear them.&nbsp; And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide
mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear:
your hands are full of blood.&nbsp; Wash you, make you clean; put away
the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn
to do well; seek judgement, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,
plead for the widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been asked to plead to-day for the mission of the Good Shepherd
in Portsea.</p>
<p>I am informed that Portsea contains some thirteen thousand souls,
divided between two parishes.&nbsp; That they, as I feared, include
some of the most ignorant and vicious of both sexes which can be found
in the kingdom; that there are few or no rich people in the place; that
the rich who have an interest in the labour of these masses live away
from the place, and from the dwellings of those whom they employ&mdash;a
social evil new to England; but growing, alas! fearfully common in it;
and that vice, and unthrift, uncertain wages, and unhealthy dwellings
produce there, as elsewhere, misery and savagery most deplorable.&nbsp;
I am told, too, that this mission has been working, nobly and self-denyingly,
among these unhappy people for some years past.&nbsp; That it can, and
ought to largely extend its operations; that it is in want of fresh
funds; that it is proposed to build a new church, which, it is hoped,
will be a centre of civilization and organization, as well as of religion
and morality, for the district; and I am bidden to invite you, as close
neighbours of Portsea, to help in the good work.&nbsp; I, of course,
know too little of local facts, or of the temper of the people of Southsea.&nbsp;
But I am bound to believe it to be the same as I have found it elsewhere.&nbsp;
And I therefore shall confine myself to general questions, and shall
treat this case of Portsea, as what it is, alas! one among a hundred
similar ones, and say to you simply what I have said for twenty-five
years, wherever and whenever I can get a hearing.&nbsp; And therefore
if I seem here and there to speak sharply and sternly, recollect that
I pay you a compliment in so doing&mdash;first, that I speak not to
you, but to all English men and women; and next, that I speak as to
those who have noble instincts, if they will be only true to them:&mdash;as
to English people, who are not afraid of being told the truth; to English
people who do wrong rather from forgetfulness and luxury, than from
meanness and cruelty aforethought; who, as far as I have seen, need,
for the most part, only to be reminded that they are doing wrong, to
reawaken them to their better selves, and set them trying honestly and
bravely to do right.</p>
<p>Let me then begin this sermon with a parable.&nbsp; Alas! that the
parable should represent a common and notorious fact.&nbsp; Suppose
yourselves in some stately palace, amid marbles and bronzes, statues
and pictures, and all that cunning brain and cunning hand, when wedded
to the high instinct of beauty, can produce.&nbsp; The furniture is
of the very richest, and kept with the most fastidious cleanliness.&nbsp;
The floors of precious wood are polished like mirrors.&nbsp; The rooms
have every appliance for the ease of the luxurious inmates.&nbsp; Everywhere
you see, not mere brute wealth, but taste, purity, and comfort.&nbsp;
There is no lack of intellect either:&mdash;wise and learned books fill
the library shelves; maps and scientific instruments crowd the tables.&nbsp;
Nor of religion either;&mdash;for the house contains a private chapel,
fitted up in the richest style of medi&aelig;val ecclesiastical art.&nbsp;
And as you walk along from polished floor to polished floor, you seem
to pass in review every object which the body, or the mind, or the spirit,
of the most civilized human being can need for its satisfaction.</p>
<p>But, next to the chapel itself, a scent of carrion makes you start.&nbsp;
You look, against the will of your smart and ostentatious guide, through
a half-open door, and see another sight&mdash;a room, dark and foul,
mildewed and ruinous; and, swept carelessly into a corner, a heap of
dirt, rags, bones, waifs and strays of every kind, decaying all together.</p>
<p>You ask, with astonishment and disgust, how comes that there? and
are told, to your fresh astonishment and disgust, that that is only
where the servants sweep the litter.&nbsp; But crouching behind the
litter, in the darkest corner, something moves.&nbsp; You go up to it,
in spite of the entreaties of your guide, and find an aged idiot gibbering
in her rags.</p>
<p>Who is she?&nbsp; Oh, an old servant&mdash;or a child, or possibly
a grand-child, of some old servant&mdash;your guide does not remember
which.&nbsp; She is better out of the way there in the corner.&nbsp;
At all events she can find plenty to eat among the dirt-heap; and as
for her soul, if she has one, the clergyman is said to come and see
her now and then, so probably it will be saved.</p>
<p>Would you not turn away from that palace with the contemptuous thought&mdash;Civilized?&nbsp;
Refined?&nbsp; These people&rsquo;s civilization is but skin-deep.&nbsp;
Their refinement is but an outside show.&nbsp; Look into the first back
room, and you find that they are foul barbarians still.</p>
<p>And yet such, literally such and no better, is the refinement of
modern England; such, and no better, is the civilization of our great
towns.&nbsp; Such I fear from what I am told, is the civilization of
Southsea, beside the barbarism to be found in Portsea close at hand.&nbsp;
Dirt and squalor, brutality and ignorance close beside such luxury as
the world has not seen, it may be, since the bad days of Heathen Rome.</p>
<p>But more, if you turned away, you would say to yourselves, if you
were thoughtful persons&mdash;not only what barbarism, but what folly.&nbsp;
The owner and his household are in daily danger.&nbsp; The idiot in
discontent, or even in mere folly, may seize a lighted candle, burn
petroleum, as she did in Paris of late, and set the whole palace on
fire.&nbsp; And more, the very dirt is in itself inflammable, and capable,
as it festers, of spontaneous combustion.&nbsp; How many a stately house
has been burnt down ere now, simply by the heating of greasy rags, thrust
away in some neglected closet.&nbsp; Let the owner of the house beware.&nbsp;
He is living, voluntarily, over a volcano of his own making.</p>
<p>But more&mdash;what if you were told that the fault lay not so much
in the negligence of servants as in that of the owner himself, that
the master of that palace had over him a King, to whom all that was
foul, neglectful, cruel, was inexpressibly hateful, so hateful that
He once had actually stepped off the throne of the universe to die for
such creatures as that poor idiot and her forgotten parents?&nbsp; Would
you not question whether the prayers offered up in that chapel would
have any answer from Him, save that awful answer He once gave?&nbsp;
&ldquo;When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes: yea,
when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, my friends, you who understand my parable, has the awful thought
never struck you that such may be God&rsquo;s answer to the prayers
of a nation which leaves in its midst such barbarism, such heathenism,
as exists in every great town of this realm?&nbsp; And what if you were
told next that the laws of His kingdom were eternal and inexorable,
and that one of His cardinal laws is&mdash;that as a man sows, so shall
he reap; that every sin punishes itself, even though the sinner does
not know that he has sinned; that he who knew not his master&rsquo;s
will, and did it not, shall be beaten with few stripes; that the innocent
babe does not escape unburnt, because it knew not that fire burns; that
the good man who lives in a malarious alley does not escape fever and
cholera, because he does not know that dirt breeds pestilence; that,
in a word, he who knew not his master&rsquo;s will, and did it not,
shall be beaten with few stripes; but that he who knew his master&rsquo;s
will, and did it not, shall be beaten with many stripes?&nbsp; Then
of how many and how heavy stripes, think you, will the inhabitant of
that palace be counted worthy, who has been taught by Christianity for
the last fifteen hundred years, and by physical science and political
economy for the last fifty years, and yet persists, in defiance of his
own knowledge, in leaving his used-up servants, and their children and
grand-children after them, to rot, body, mind, and soul, in the very
precincts of the palace, having no other excuse to offer for this than
that it is too much trouble to treat them better, and that, on the whole,
he can make money more rapidly by thus throwing away that human dirt,
and leaving it to decay where it can, regardless what it pollutes and
poisons; just as the manufacturer can make money more rapidly by not
consuming his own smoke, but letting it stream out of the chimney to
poison with blackness and desolation the green fields where God meant
little children to gather flowers?</p>
<p>Ladies, to you I appeal, not merely as women, but as Ladies, if (as
I am assured by those who know you), ladies you are, in the grand old
meaning of that grand old word.</p>
<p>If so&mdash;you know then, what it is to be a lady and what not.&nbsp;
You know that it is not to go, like the daughters of Zion in Isaiah&rsquo;s
time, with mincing gait, and borrowed head-gear, and tasteless finery,
the head well-nigh empty, the heart full of little save vanity and vexation
of spirit, busy all the week over cheap novels and expensive dresses,
and on Sunday over a little dilettante devotion.&nbsp; You know, I take
for granted, that whatever the world may think or say, that to be that,
is not to be a lady.</p>
<p>For you know, I take for granted, what that word lady meant at first.&nbsp;
That it meant she who gave out the loaves, the housewife who provided
food and clothes; the stewardess of her household and dependants; the
spinner among her maidens; the almsgiver to the poor; the worshipper
in the chapel, praying for wild men away in battle.&nbsp; The being
from whom flowed forth all gracious influences of thought and order,
of bounty and compassion, of purity and piety, civilizing and Christianizing
a whole family, a whole domain.&nbsp; This it was to be a lady, in the
old days when too many men had little care save to make war.&nbsp; And
this it is to be a lady still, in the new days in which too many men
have little care save to make money.&nbsp; Show then that you can be
ladies still.&nbsp; That the spirit is the spirit of your ancestresses,
though the form in which it must show itself is changed with the change
of society.</p>
<p>To you I appeal; to as many in this church as are ladies, not in
name only, but in spirit and in truth.&nbsp; Say to your fathers, husbands,
brothers, sons, and say too, and that boldly, to the tradesmen with
whom you deal&mdash;Do you hear this?&nbsp; Do you hear that there are
savages and heathens, generations of them, within a rifle-shot of the
house?&nbsp; And you cannot exterminate them; cannot drive them out,
much less kill them.&nbsp; You must convert them, improve them, make
them civilized and Christian, if not for their own sakes, at least for
our sakes, and for our children.</p>
<p>And if they should answer: My dears, it is too true.&nbsp; But we
did not make them or put them there, and they are not in our parish.&nbsp;
They are no concern of ours, and besides they will not hurt us.</p>
<p>Answer them: Not made by our fault!&nbsp; True, our hands are more
or less clean: but what of that?&nbsp; There they are.&nbsp; If you
had a tribe of Red Indians on the frontier of your settlement, would
you take the less guard against them, because you did not put them there?&nbsp;
Not in our parish, and what of that?&nbsp; They are in our county; they
are in England.&nbsp; Has man the right, has man the power in the sight
of God to draw any imaginary line of demarcation between Englishman
and Englishman, especially when that line is drawn between rich and
poor?&nbsp; England knows no line of demarcation, save the shore of
the great sea; and even that her generosity is overleaping at this moment
at the call of mere humanity, in bounty to sufferers by the West Indian
hurricane, and by the Chicago fire.&nbsp; Will you send your help across
the Atlantic; and deny it to the sufferers at your own doors?&nbsp;
At least, if the rich be confined by an imaginary line across, the poor
on the other side will not&mdash;they will cross it freely enough; and
what they will bring with them will be concern enough of ours.&nbsp;
Would it not be our concern if there was small-pox, scarlet fever, cholera
among them?&nbsp; Should we not fear lest that might hurt us?&nbsp;
Would you not bestir yourselves then?&nbsp; And do you not know that
it is among such people as these that pestilence is always bred?&nbsp;
And if not, is not the pestilence of the soul more subtle and more contagious
than any pestilence of the body?&nbsp; What is the spreading power of
fever to the spreading power of vice, which springs from tongue to tongue,
from eye to eye, from heart to heart?&nbsp; What matter whether they
be one mile off or five?&nbsp; Will not they corrupt our servants; and
those servants again our children?</p>
<p>And say to them, if you be prudent and thrifty housewives, Do not
tell us that their condition costs you nothing.&nbsp; Even in pocket
you are suffering now&mdash;as all England is suffering&mdash;from the
existence of heathens and savages, reckless, profligate, pauperized.&nbsp;
For if you pay no poor-rates for their support, the shop-keepers with
whom you deal pay poor-rates; and must and do repay themselves, out
of your pockets, in the form of increased prices for their goods.</p>
<p>And when you have said all this, ladies, and more,&mdash;for more
will suggest itself to your woman&rsquo;s wit,&mdash;say to them with
St Paul&mdash;&ldquo;And yet show we unto you a more excellent way,&rdquo;&mdash;a
nobler argument&mdash;and that is Charity.</p>
<p>Not almsgiving.&nbsp; I had almost said, anything but that; making
bad worse, the improvident more improvident, the liar more ready to
lie, the idler more ready to idle.&nbsp; But the Charity which is Humanity,
which is the spirit of pure pity, the Spirit of Christ and of God.</p>
<p>Say then, Even if these poor creatures did us no harm, as they must
and will do&mdash;civilize and christianize them for their own sakes,
simply because they must be so very miserable&mdash;miserable too often
with acute and conscious misery; too often with a worse misery, dull
and unconscious, which knows not, stupified by ignorance and vice, that
it is miserable, and ought to be more miserable still.&nbsp; For who
is so worthy of our pity, as he who knows not that he is pitiable?&mdash;who
takes ignorance, dirt, vice, passion, and the wretchedness which vice
and passion bring, as all in the day&rsquo;s work, as he takes the rain
and hail, the frost and snow,&mdash;as unavoidable necessities of mortal
life, for which the only temporary alleviation is&mdash;drink?</p>
<p>If the refined and pure-minded lady does not pity such beings as
that, I know not of what her refinement is made.&nbsp; If the religious
lady will not bestir herself, and make sacrifices to teach such people
that that is not what God meant them to be&mdash;to stir up in them
a noble self-discontent, a noble self-abhorrence, which may be the beginning
of repentance and amendment of life&mdash;I know not of what her religion
is made.</p>
<p>One word more&mdash;I know that such thoughts as I have put before
you to-day are painful.&nbsp; I know that we all&mdash;I as much as
anyone in this church&mdash;are tempted to put them by, and say, I will
think of things beautiful, not of things ugly; of art, poetry, science&mdash;all
that is orderly, graceful, ennobling; and not of dirt, ignorance, vice,
misery, all that is disorderly, degrading.&nbsp; Nay, even the most
pious at times are tempted to say, I will think of heaven and not of
earth.&nbsp; I will lift up my heart, and try to behold the glory and
the goodness of God, and not the disgrace and sin of man.</p>
<p>But only for a time may they thus think and speak.&nbsp; Happy if
they can, at moments, lift up their hearts unto the Lord, and catch
one glimpse of Him enthroned in perfect serenity and perfect order,
governing the worlds with that all-embracing justice, which is at the
same time all-embracing love, and so, giving Him thanks for His great
glory, gain heart and hope to&mdash;what?&nbsp; To descend again, even
were it from the beatific vision itself, to this disordered earth, to
work a little&mdash;and, alas how little&mdash;at lessening the sum
of human ignorance, human vice, human misery&mdash;even as their Lord
and Saviour stooped from the throne of the universe, and from the bosom
of the Father, to toil and die for such as curse about the streets outside.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXXVII.&nbsp; THE SURPRISE OF THE RIGHTEOUS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Preached at Southsea for the Mission of the Good Shepherd.&nbsp;
<i>October</i> 1871.</p>
<p>St Matt. xxv. 34-37.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then shall the King say unto them
on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungred,
and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger,
and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited
me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.&nbsp; Then shall the righteous
answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we Thee an hungred, and fed Thee?
or thirsty, and gave Thee drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us consider awhile this magnificent parable, and consider it
carefully, lest we mistake its meaning.&nbsp; And let us specially consider
one point about it, which is at first sight puzzling, and which has
caused, ere now, many to miss (as I believe, with some of the best commentators,
) the meaning of the whole&mdash;which is this: that the righteous in
the parable did not know that when they did good to their fellow-creatures,
they did it to Christ the Lord.</p>
<p>Now there are two kinds of people who do know that, because they
have been taught it by Holy Scripture, who would make two very different
answers to the Lord, when He spoke in such words to them.&nbsp; At least
so we may suppose, for they are ready to make such answers here on earth;
and therefore, we may suppose that if they dared, they would answer
so at the day of judgment.&nbsp; One party would&mdash;or at least might
say, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, I knew that whatever I did to the poor, I did
to Thee; and therefore I did all I could for the poor.&nbsp; I started
charitable institutions, I spoke at missionary meetings, I put my name
down for large sums in every subscription list, I built churches and
chapels, schools and hospitals; I gained the reputation among men of
being a leading philanthropist, foremost in every good work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What answer the man who said that would receive from the Lord, I
know not; for who am I that I should put words into the mouth of my
Creator and my God?&nbsp; But I think that the awful majesty of the
Lord&rsquo;s very countenance might strike such a man dumb, ere he had
time to say those vain proud words, and strike his conscience through
with the thought, Yes, I have been charitable: but have I been humane?&nbsp;
I have been a philanthropist: but have I really loved my fellow-men?&nbsp;
Have I not made my interest in the heathen whom I have not seen, an
excuse for despising and hating my countrymen whom I have seen, if they
dared to differ from me in religion or in politics?&nbsp; I have given
large sums in charity: but have I ever sacrificed anything for my fellow-men?&nbsp;
I have given Christ back a pound in every hundred&mdash;perhaps even
out of every ten which He has given me: but what did I do with the other
nine pounds save spend them on myself?&nbsp; Is there a luxury in which
a respectable man could safely indulge, which I have denied myself?&nbsp;
What have I been after all, with all my philanthropy and charity, but
a selfish, luxurious, pompous personage? an actor doing my alms to be
seen of men?&nbsp; I did my good works as unto Christ?&mdash;No; I did
them as unto myself&mdash;to get honour from men while I lived, and
to save my selfish soul when I died.&nbsp; God be merciful to me a sinner!&nbsp;
That such thoughts ought to pass through too many persons&rsquo; hearts
in this generation, I fear is too certain.&nbsp; God grant that they
may do so before it is too late.&nbsp; But it is plain, at least, that
these are not the sheep of whom Christ speaks.</p>
<p>Again, there are another, and a very different kind of persons, who
we have a right to fancy, would answer the Lord somewhat thus: &ldquo;Oh
Lord, speak not of it.&nbsp; It may be I have tried to do a little good
to a poor suffering creature here and there; to feed a few hungry, clothe
a few naked, visit a few sick and prisoners.&nbsp; But Lord, how could
I do less? after all that Thou hast done and suffered for me; and after
Thy own gracious saying, that inasmuch as I did anything to the least
of Thy brethren, I did it to Thee.&nbsp; What less could I do, Lord?&mdash;and
after all, what a pitifully small amount I have done!&nbsp; Thou did&rsquo;st
hunger for me&mdash;for whom have I ever hungered?&nbsp; Thou did&rsquo;st
suffer for me&mdash;for whom have I ever suffered?&nbsp; Thou did&rsquo;st
die for me&mdash;for whom have I ever died?&nbsp; And I did not&mdash;I
fear in the depth of my heart&mdash;do what I did really for Thee; but
for the very pleasure of doing it.&nbsp; I began to do good from a sense
of duty to Thee; but after a while I did good, I fear, only because
it was so pleasant&mdash;so pleasant to see human faces looking up into
mine with gratitude; so pleasant to have little children, even though
they were none of my own, clinging to me in trust; so pleasant when
I went home at night to feel that I had made one human being a little
happier, a little better, even only a little more comfortable; so pleasant
to give up my own pleasure, in order to give pleasure to others, that
I fear I forgot Thee in my own enjoyment.&nbsp; If I sinned in that,
Lord forgive.&nbsp; But at least, I have had my reward.&nbsp; My work
among Thy poor was its own reward, a reward of inward happiness beyond
all that earth can give&mdash;and now Thou speakest of rewarding me
over and above, with I know not what of undeserved bliss.&nbsp; Thou
art too good, O Lord, as is Thy wont from all eternity.&nbsp; Let me
go and hide myself&mdash;a more than unprofitable servant, who has not
done the hundredth part of that which it was my duty to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What answer the Lord would make to the modest misgivings of that
sweet soul, I cannot say; for again, who am I, that I should put words
into the mouth of my Creator and my God?&nbsp; But this I know, that
I had rather be&mdash;what I am not, and never shall be&mdash;such a
soul as that in the last day, than own all the kingdoms of the world
and the glory thereof.&nbsp; Still, it is plain that such persons, however
holy, however loving, are not those of whom our Lord speaks in this
parable.&nbsp; For they, too, know, and must know, that inasmuch as
they showed mercy unto one of the least of the Lord&rsquo;s brethren,
they showed it unto Him.&nbsp; But the special peculiarity of the persons
of whom our Lord speaks, is that they did not know, that they had no
suspicion, that in showing kindness to men, they were showing kindness
to Christ.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; they answer, &ldquo;when saw we
Thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a revelation to them, in the strictest and deepest sense of
the word.&nbsp; A revelation, that is an unveiling, a drawing away of
a veil which was before their eyes and hiding from them a divine and
most blessed fact, of which they had been unaware.&nbsp; But who are
they?&nbsp; I think we must agree with some of the best commentators,
among others with that excellent divine and excellent man, now lost
to the Church on earth, the late Dean of Canterbury, that they are persons
who, till the day of judgment, have never heard of Christ; but who then,
for the first time, as Dean Alford says, &ldquo;are overwhelmed with
the sight of the grace which has been working in and for them, and the
glory which is now their blessed portion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such persons,
perhaps, as those two poor negresses&mdash;to remind you of a story
which was famous in our fathers&rsquo; time&mdash;those two poor negresses,
I say, who found the African traveller, Mungo Park, dying of fever and
starvation, and saved his life, simply from human love&mdash;as they
sung to themselves by his bedside&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us pity the poor white man;<br />He has no mother to make
his bed,<br />No wife to grind his corn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Perhaps it is such as those, who have succoured human beings they
knew not why, simply from a divine instinct, from the voice of Christ
within their hearts, which they felt they must obey, though they knew
not whose voice it was.&nbsp; Perhaps, I say, it is such as those, that
Christ will astonish at the last day by the words, &ldquo;Come ye blessed
of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this be the true meaning of our Lord&rsquo;s words, what comfort
and hope they may give us, when we think, as we are bound to think,
if we have a true humanity in us, of the hundreds of millions of heathen
now alive, and of the thousands of millions of heathen who have lived
and died.&nbsp; Sinful they are as a whole.&nbsp; Sinning, it may be,
without law, but perishing without law.&nbsp; For the wages of sin are
death, and can be nothing else.&nbsp; But may not Christ have His elect
among them?&nbsp; May not His Spirit be working in some of them?&nbsp;
May He not have His sheep among them, who hear His voice though they
know not that it is His voice?&nbsp; They hear a voice within their
hearts whispering to them, &ldquo;Be loving, be merciful, be humane,
in one word be just, and do to others as you would they should do to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And whose voice can that be but the voice of Christ,
and the Spirit of God?&nbsp; Those loving instincts come not from the
fleshly fallen nature, or natural man.&nbsp; That says to us, &ldquo;Be
selfish; do not be loving.&nbsp; Do to others not what you would they
should do to you, but do to others whatever is pleasant and profitable
to yourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; And alas! the heathen, and too many who
call themselves Christians, listen to that carnal voice, and live the
life of selfishness and pleasure, of anger and revenge, of tyranny and
cruelty&mdash;the end of which is death.</p>
<p>But if any among those heathen&mdash;hearing within their hearts
the other voice, the gracious voice which says, &ldquo;Do unto others
as you would they should do unto you,&rdquo;&mdash;feel that that voice
is a good voice and a right command, which must be obeyed, and which
it is beautiful and delightful to obey, and so obey it; may we not hope
then, that Christ, who has called them, will perfect His own work; and
in His own good way, and His own good time, deliver them from their
sin and ignorance, and vouchsafe to them at last that knowledge of the
true and holy God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, whom truly to know
is everlasting life?&nbsp; They are Christ&rsquo;s lost sheep: but they
are still His sheep who hear His voice.&nbsp; May He not fulfil His
own words to them, and go forth and seek such souls, and lay them on
His shoulder, and bring them home; saying to His Church on earth, and
to His Church in heaven, &ldquo;Rejoice with Me: for I have found my
sheep which was lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now if we can thus have hope for some among the heathen abroad, shall
we not have hope, too, for some among the heathen at home? for some
among that mass of human corruption which welters around the walls of
so many of our cities?&nbsp; I am not going to make vain excuses for
them; and say they are but the victims of circumstance.&nbsp; The great
majority of them are the victims of their own low instincts.&nbsp; They
have chosen the broad and easy road of animalism, which leads to destruction.&nbsp;
They have sown to the flesh, and they will of the flesh reap corruption.&nbsp;
For the laws of God are inexorable; and the curse of the law is sure,
namely, &ldquo;The wages of sin are death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neither dare
I encourage too vast hopes and say, If we had money enough, if we had
machinery enough, if we had zeal enough, we might convert them all,
and save them all.&nbsp; I dare not believe it.&nbsp; The many, I fear,
will always go the broad road; the few the narrow one.&nbsp; And all
we dare say is, if we have faith enough, we can convert some.&nbsp;
We can at least fulfil our ordination vow.&nbsp; We can seek out Christ&rsquo;s
sheep scattered abroad about this naughty world, and tell them of His
fold, and try to bring them home.</p>
<p>But how shall we know Christ&rsquo;s sheep when we see them?&nbsp;
How, but by the very test which Christ has laid down, it seems to me,
in this very parable?&nbsp; Is there in one of them the high instincts&mdash;even
the desire to do a merciful act?&nbsp; Let us watch for that: and when
in the most brutal man, and&mdash;alas that I should have to use the
words&mdash;in the most brutal woman, we see any touch of nobleness,
justice, benevolence, pity, tenderness&mdash;in one word, any touch,
however momentary, of unselfishness,&mdash;let us spring at that, knowing
that there is the soul we seek; there is a lost sheep of Christ; there
is Christ Himself, working unknown upon a human soul; there is a soul
ready for the gospel, and not far from the kingdom of God.&nbsp; But
what shall we say to that lost sheep?&nbsp; Shall we terrify it by threats
of hell?&nbsp; Shall we even allure it by promises of heaven?&nbsp;
Not so&mdash;not so at least at first&mdash;for that would be to appeal
to bodily fear and bodily pleasure, to the very selfishness from which
Christ is trying to deliver it; and to neglect the very prevenient grace,
the very hold on the soul which Christ Himself offers us.&nbsp; Let
us determine with St. Paul to know nothing among our fellow-men but
Christ crucified.&nbsp; Let us appeal just to that in the soul which
is unselfish; not to the instincts of loss and gain, but to those nobler
instincts of justice and mercy; just because they are not the man&rsquo;s
or the woman&rsquo;s instincts; but Christ&rsquo;s within them, the
light of Christ and the Spirit of Christ, the spirit of love and justice
saying, &ldquo;Do unto others as you would they should do unto you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Do you doubt that?&nbsp; I trust not.&nbsp; For to doubt that is to
doubt whether God be truly the Giver of all good things.&nbsp; To doubt
that is to begin to disbelieve St. Paul&rsquo;s great saying, &ldquo;In
me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; To doubt
that is to lay our hearts and minds open to the insidious poison of
that Pelagian heresy which, received under new shapes and names, is
becoming the cardinal heresy of modern disbelief.&nbsp; No; we will
have faith in Christ, faith in our creeds, faith in catholic doctrine;
and will say to that man or that woman, even as they wallow still in
the darkness and the mire, &ldquo;Behold your God!&nbsp; That cup of
cold water which you gave, you knew not why,&mdash;Christ told you to
give it, and to Him you gave.&nbsp; That night watch beside the bed
of a woman as fallen as yourself,&mdash;Christ bade you watch, and you
watched by Him.&nbsp; For that drunken ruffian, whom you, a drunken
ruffian yourself, leaped into the sea to save, Christ bade you leap,
and like St. Christopher of old, you bore, though you knew it not, your
Saviour and your God to land.&rdquo;&nbsp; And if they shall make answer,
&ldquo;And who is He that I did not know Him? who is He that I should
know Him now?&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us point them&mdash;and whither else
should we point them in heaven or earth?&mdash;to Christ upon the cross,
and say, &ldquo;Behold your God!&nbsp; This He did, this He condescended,
this He dared, this He suffered for you, and such as you.&nbsp; This
is what He, the Maker of the universe, is like.&nbsp; This is what He
has been trying to make you like, in your small degree, every time a
noble, a generous, a pitiful, a merciful emotion crossed your heart;
every time you forgot yourself, even for a moment, and thought of the
welfare of a fellow-man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If that tale, if that sight, if that revelation and unveiling of
Christ to the poor sinful soul does not work in it an abhorrence of
past sin, a craving after future holiness, an admiration and a reverence
for Christ Himself, which is, <i>ipso facto</i>, saving faith; if that
soul does not reply&mdash;it may not be in words, but in feelings too
deep for words,&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; this is indeed noble, indeed Godlike,
worthy of a God, and worthy therefore to be at once imitated and adored:&rdquo;
then, indeed, the Cross of Christ must have lost that miraculous power
which it has possessed, for more than eighteen hundred years, as the
highest &ldquo;moral ideal&rdquo; which ever was seen, or ever can be
seen, by the reason and the heart of man.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXXVIII.&nbsp; THE LORD&rsquo;S PRAYER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Windsor Castle</i>, 1867.&nbsp; <i>Chester Cathedral</i>, 1870.</p>
<p>Matthew vi. 9, 10.&nbsp; &ldquo;After this manner, therefore, pray
ye, Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom
come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us think for a while on these great words.&nbsp; Let us remember
that some day or other they will certainly be fulfilled.&nbsp; Let us
remember that Christ would not have bidden us use them, unless He intended
that they should be fulfilled.&nbsp; And let us remember, likewise,
that we must help to fulfil them.&nbsp; We need to be reminded of this
from time to time, for we are all inclined to forget it.&nbsp; We are
inclined to forget that mankind has a Father in heaven, who is ruling,
and guiding, and educating us, His human children, to</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;One far off divine event,<br />Toward which
the whole creation moves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We are apt to fancy that the world will always go on very much as
it goes on now; that it will be guided, not by the will of God, but
by the will of man; by man&rsquo;s craft; by man&rsquo;s ambition; by
man&rsquo;s self-interest; by man&rsquo;s cravings after the luxuries,
and even after the mere necessities of this life.&nbsp; In a word, we
are apt to fancy that man, not God, is the master of this earth on which
we live, and that men have no king over them in heaven.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer tells us that men <i>have</i> a king over
them in heaven, and that that king is a Father likewise&mdash;a Father
whose name will one day be hallowed above all names.&nbsp; That the
world will not always go on as it goes on now, but that the Father&rsquo;s
kingdom will come.&nbsp; That above the will of man, there is a will
of God, which must be done, and therefore will be done some day.&nbsp;
In a word, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer tells us that this world is under
a Divine government; that the Lord, even Jesus Christ our Saviour, is
King, be the people never so impatient.&nbsp; That He sitteth between
the cherubim, master of all the powers of nature, be the earth never
so unquiet.&nbsp; That His power loves justice.&nbsp; That He has prepared
equity.&nbsp; That He has executed, and therefore will execute to the
end, judgment and righteousness in the earth.&nbsp; That Christ reigns
in justice and in love.&nbsp; That He has for those who disobey His
laws the most terrible penalties; for those who obey them blessings
such as eye hath not seen nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the
heart of man to conceive.&nbsp; That He must reign till He has put all
enemies under His feet and delivered up the kingdom to God, even the
Father.&nbsp; That on that great day He will prove His royalty, and
His Father&rsquo;s royalty, in the sight of all heaven and earth, and
make every soul of man aware, in a fashion which none shall mistake,
that He is Lord and King.&nbsp; This is the message which the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer brings&mdash;a message of mingled fear and joy.</p>
<p>But a message of more joy than fear.&nbsp; Else why does our Lord
bid us pray for it that it may come to pass?&mdash;pray daily, before
we even pray for our daily bread, or the forgiveness of our sins&mdash;that
His Father&rsquo;s name may be hallowed, His Father&rsquo;s kingdom
come, His Father&rsquo;s will be done?</p>
<p>He bids us pray for that because it will bring blessings.&nbsp; Blessings
to every soul of man who desires to be good and true.&nbsp; Because
it will satisfy every aspiration which has ever risen up from the heart
of man after what is noble, what is generous, what is just, what is
useful, what is pure.&nbsp; Surely it is so.&nbsp; Consider but these
short words of my text, and think what the world would be like if they
were fulfilled; what the next world will actually be like when they
are fulfilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallowed be thy name.&rdquo;&nbsp; But what name?&nbsp; The
name of Father.&nbsp; If that name were hallowed by men, there would
be an end of all superstitions.&nbsp; The root of all superstitions,
fanaticisms, and false religions is this&mdash;that they do not hallow
the name of Father.&nbsp; They do not see that it is a Holy name, a
beautiful and tender as well as an awful and venerable name.&nbsp; They
think of fathers, like too many among themselves, proud, and arbitrary,
selfish and cruel.&nbsp; They say in their hearts, even such fathers
as we are, such is God.&nbsp; Therefore, they shrink from God, and turn
from Him to idols, to the Virgin Mary, or Saints, or any other beings
who can deliver them (as they fancy) out of the hands of their Father
in heaven.&nbsp; If men once learnt to hallow the name of Father, to
think of a father as one who not only possessed power but felt love,
who not only had rights which he would enforce, and issued commands
which must be obeyed, but who felt yearning sympathy for his children&rsquo;s
weakness, an active interest in their education, and was ready to labour
for, to sacrifice himself for, his family&mdash;That would be truly
to hallow the name of Father, and look on it as a holy thing, whether
in heaven above or in earth beneath.</p>
<p>To hallow the Father&rsquo;s name would abolish all the superstition
of the world.&nbsp; And so the coming of the Father&rsquo;s kingdom
would abolish all the misrule and anarchy of the world.&nbsp; For the
kingdom of God the Father is a kingdom of perfect order, perfect justice,
perfect usefulness.&nbsp; Surely the first consequences of that kingdom&rsquo;s
coming would be, that every one would be exactly in his right place,
and that every one would get his exact deserts.&nbsp; That would indeed
be the kingdom of God on earth.&nbsp; The prospect of such a kingdom
would be painful enough to those who were in their wrong place, to those
who were undeserving.&nbsp; All who were useless, taking wages either
from man or from God, without doing any work in return, all these would
have but too good reason to dread the coming of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>But those who were trying earnestly to do their work, though amid
many mistakes and failures, why should they dread the coming of the
kingdom of God?&nbsp; Why should they shrink from remembering that,
though God&rsquo;s kingdom is not come in perfection and fulness, it
is here already, and they are in it?&nbsp; Why should they shrink from
that thought?&nbsp; They will find it full of comfort, of strength,
and hope, if they will but hallow their Father&rsquo;s name, and remember
the fact of all facts&mdash;that they have a Father in heaven.&nbsp;
There are thousands on earth, from the highest to the lowest, who can
say honestly&mdash;to take the commonest instance&mdash;every parent
can say it&mdash;&ldquo;I have a heavy work to do, a heavy responsibility
to fulfil.&nbsp; God knows I did not seek it, thrust myself into it;
it was thrust upon me.&nbsp; It came to me in the course of nature or
of society, and circumstances over which I had no control.&nbsp; In
one word it was <i>my Duty</i>.&nbsp; But now that I have my duty to
do, behold I cannot do it.&nbsp; I try my best, but I fail.&nbsp; I
come short daily of my own low standard of duty.&nbsp; How much more
of God&rsquo;s perfect standard of it!&nbsp; And the burden of responsibility,
the regret for failure, is more than I can bear.</p>
<p>To such we may answer, hallow your Father&rsquo;s name, and be of
good cheer.&nbsp; <i>Your Father</i> has given you your work.&nbsp;
Because He is a Father, He is surely educating you for your work.&nbsp;
Because He is a Father, He will surely set you no task which you are
unable to fulfil.&nbsp; Because He is a Father, He will help you to
fulfil your task.&nbsp; Your station and calling is His will; and because
it is a Father&rsquo;s will it is a good will.</p>
<p>And the Judge of your work&mdash;He is no stern taskmaster, no unfeeling
tyrant, but Jesus Christ, your Lord, who died for you on the Cross.&nbsp;
He knows what is in man.&nbsp; He remembereth that we are but dust.&nbsp;
Else the spirit would fail before Him and the souls which He has made.&nbsp;
He can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, seeing that He
was tempted in all things like as we are, yet without sin.&nbsp; He
can sympathise utterly; He can make all just allowances; He will judge
not by outward results, but by the inward will and desire.&nbsp; He
will judge not by the hearing of the ear, nor the seeing of the eye,
as the shallow cruel world judges, but He will judge righteous judgment.&nbsp;
Trust your cause to Him, and trust yourself to Him.&nbsp; Believe that
if He can sympathise, He can also help; for from Him, as well as from
His Father, proceeds the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, the
spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of power and might, the
spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord, and He will inspire you
to see your duty, and do your duty, and rejoice in your duty, in spite
of weariness and failure, and all the burdens of the flesh and of the
spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If that were done, it would abolish all the vice of the world, and therefore
the misery which springs from vice.&nbsp; Ah, that God&rsquo;s will
were but done on earth as it is in the material heaven overhead, in
perfect order and obedience, as the stars roll in their courses, without
rest, yet without haste; as all created things, even the most awful,
fire and hail, snow and vapour, wind and storm, fulfil God&rsquo;s word,
who hath made them sure for ever and ever, and given them a law which
shall not be broken.&nbsp; But above them; above the divine and wonderful
order of the material universe, and the winds which are God&rsquo;s
angels, and the flames of fire which are His messengers; above all,
the prophets and apostles have caught sight of another divine and wonderful
order of <i>rational</i> beings, of races, loftier and purer than man&mdash;angels
and archangels, thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, fulfilling
God&rsquo;s will in heaven as it is not alas! fulfilled on earth.</p>
<p>And beside them, beside the innumerable company of angels, are there
not the spirits of just men made perfect, freed from the fetters of
the gross animal body, and now somewhere in that boundless universe
in which this earth is but a tiny speck, doing God&rsquo;s will, as
they longed to do it on earth, with clearer light, fuller faith, deeper
love, mightier powers of usefulness?&nbsp; Ah, that we were like to
them!&nbsp; Ah, that we could perform the least part of our day&rsquo;s
work on earth as it is performed by saints and angels for ever in heaven!&nbsp;
When we think of what this poor confused world is, and then what it
might be, were God&rsquo;s will done therein as it is done in heaven;
what it might be if even the little of God&rsquo;s will which we already
know, the little of God&rsquo;s laws which are proved already to be
certain, were carried out with any earnestness by the majority of mankind,
or even of one civilized nation&mdash;when we think&mdash;to take the
very lowest ground&mdash;of the health and wealth, the peace and happiness,
which would cover this earth did men only do the will of God; then,
if we have human hearts within us&mdash;if we care at all for the welfare
of our fellow-men&mdash;ought not this to be the prayer of all our prayers,
and ought we not to welcome any event, however awful, which would bring
mankind to reason and to virtue, and to God, and abolish the sin and
misery of this unhappy world?</p>
<p>To abolish the superstition, the misrule, the vice, the misery of
this world.&nbsp; That is what Christ will do in the day when He has
put all enemies under His feet.&nbsp; That is what Christ has been doing,
step by step, ever since that day when first He came to do His Father&rsquo;s
will on earth in great humility.&nbsp; Therefore, that is what we must
do, each in our place and station, if we be indeed His subjects, fellow-workers
with Him in the improvement of the human race, fellow-soldiers with
Him in the battle against evil.</p>
<p>But what we wish to do for our fellow-creatures, we must do first
for ourselves.&nbsp; We can give them nothing save what God has already
given us.&nbsp; We must become good before we can make them good, and
wise before we can make them wise.&nbsp; Let us pray, then, the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer in spirit and in truth.&nbsp; Let us pray that we may hallow
the name of God, our Father.&nbsp; Let us pray that His kingdom may
come in our own hearts.&nbsp; Let us pray that we may do His will on
earth as those whom we love and honour do it in heaven.&nbsp; Let us
keep that before us, day and night, as the aim and purpose of our lives.&nbsp;
Let us pray for forgiveness of our failures in that; for help to do
that better as our years run on.&nbsp; So we shall be ready for the
day in which Christ shall have accomplished the number of His elect,
and hastened His kingdom.&nbsp; So we shall be found in that dread day,
not on the side of evil, but of God; not on the side of darkness, anarchy,
and vice, but on the side of light, of justice, and of virtue, which
is the side of Christ and of God.&nbsp; And so we, with all those that
are departed in the faith of His holy name, shall have our perfect consummation
and bliss in His eternal and everlasting glory, to which may He, of
His great mercy, bring us all.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXXIX.&nbsp; THE DISTRACTED MIND</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>. 1871.</p>
<p>Matthew vi. 34.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take no thought for the morrow, for
the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.&nbsp; Sufficient
unto the day is the evil thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scholars will tell you that the words &ldquo;take no thought&rdquo;
do not exactly express our Lord&rsquo;s meaning in this text.&nbsp;
That they should rather stand, &ldquo;Be not anxious about to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And doubtless they are right on the whole.&nbsp; But the truth is, that
we have no word in English which exactly expresses the Greek word which
St Matthew uses in his gospel, and which we are bound to believe exactly
expresses our Lord&rsquo;s meaning, in whatever language He spoke.&nbsp;
The nearest English word, I believe, is&mdash;distracted.&nbsp; Be ye
not distracted about to-morrow.&nbsp; I do not mean the vulgar sense
of the word&mdash;which is losing one&rsquo;s senses.&nbsp; But the
old and true sense, which is still used by those who speak good English.</p>
<p>To distract, means literally to pull a thing two different ways&mdash;even
to pull it asunder.&nbsp; We speak of distracting a man&rsquo;s attention,
when we call him off from looking at one thing to make him look at something
else, and we call anything which interrupts us in our business, or puts
a thought suddenly out of our heads, a distraction.&nbsp; Now the Greek
word which St Matthew uses, means very nearly this&mdash;Be not divided
in your thoughts&mdash;do not think of two things at once&mdash;do not
distract your attention from to-day&rsquo;s work, by fearing and hoping
about to-morrow.&nbsp; Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof; and
you will have quite trouble enough to get through to-day honestly and
well, without troubling yourself with to-morrow&mdash;which may turn
out very unlike anything which you can dream.&nbsp; This, I think, is
the true meaning of the text; and with it, I think, agrees another word
of our Lord&rsquo;s which St Luke gives&mdash;And be ye not of doubtful
mind.&nbsp; Literally, Do not be up in the air&mdash;blown helpless
hither and thither, by every gust of wind, instead of keeping on the
firm ground, and walking straight on about your business, stoutly and
patiently, step after step.&nbsp; Have no vain fears or vain hopes about
the future; but do your duty here and now.&nbsp; That is our Lord&rsquo;s
command, and in it lies the secret of success in life.</p>
<p>For do we not find, do we not find, my friends, in practice, that
our Lord&rsquo;s words are true?&nbsp; Who are the people who get through
most work in their lives, with the least wear and tear, not merely to
their bodily health, but to their tempers and their characters?&nbsp;
Are they the anxious people?&nbsp; Those who imagine to themselves possible
misfortunes, and ask continually&mdash;What if this happened&mdash;or
that?&nbsp; What would become of me then?&nbsp; How should I be able
to pull through such a trouble?&nbsp; Where shall I find friends?&nbsp;
How shall I make myself safe against the chances and changes of life?&nbsp;
Do we not know that those people are the very ones who do little work,
and often less than none, by thus distracting their attention and their
strength from their daily duty, daily business?&nbsp; That while they
are looking anxiously for future opportunities, they are neglecting
the opportunities which they have already.&nbsp; While they are making
interest with others to help them, they forget to help themselves.&nbsp;
That in proportion as they lose faith in God and His goodness, they
lose courage and lose cheerfulness; and have too often to find a false
courage and a false cheerfulness, by drowning their cares in drink,
or in mean cunning and plotting and planning, which usually ends in
failure and in shame?</p>
<p>Are those who do most work, either the plotting or intriguing people?&nbsp;
I do not mean base false people.&nbsp; Of them I do not speak here.&nbsp;
But really good and kind people, honest at heart, who yet are full of
distractions of another sort; who are of double mind&mdash;look two
ways at once, and are afraid to be quite open, quite straightforward&mdash;who
like to <i>compass</i> their ends, as the old saying is, that is to
go round about, towards what they want, instead of going boldly up to
it; who like to try two or more ways of getting the same thing done;
and, as the proverb has it, have many irons in the fire; who love little
schemes, and plots, and mysteries, even when there is no need for them.&nbsp;
Do such people get most work done?&nbsp; Far, far from it.&nbsp; They
take more trouble about getting a little matter done, than simpler and
braver men take about getting great matters done.&nbsp; They fret themselves,
they weary themselves, they waste their brains and hearts&mdash;and
sometimes their honesty besides&mdash;and if they fail, as in the chances
and changes of this mortal life they must too often fail, have nothing
for all their schemings save vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>But the man who will get most work done, and done with the least
trouble, whether for himself, for his family, or in the calling and
duty to which God has called him, will be the man who takes our Lord&rsquo;s
advice.&nbsp; Who takes no thought for the morrow, and leaves the morrow
to take thought for itself.&nbsp; That man will believe that this world
is a well-ordered world, as it needs must be, seeing that God made it,
God redeemed it, God governs it; and that God is merciful in this&mdash;that
He rewardeth every man according to his works.&nbsp; That man will take
thought for to-day, earnestly and diligently, even at times anxiously
and in fear and trembling; but he will not distract, and divide, and
weaken his mind by taking thought for to-morrow also.&nbsp; Each day
he will set about the duty which lies nearest him, with a whole heart
and with a single eye, giving himself to it for the time, as if there
was nothing else to be done in the world.&nbsp; As for what he is to
do next, he will think little of that.&nbsp; Little, even, will he think
of whether his work will succeed or not.&nbsp; That must be as God shall
will.&nbsp; All that he is bound to do is to do his best; and his best
he can only do by throwing his whole soul into his work.&nbsp; As his
day, he trusts his strength will be; and he must not waste the strength
which God has given him for to-day on vain fears or vain dreams about
to-morrow.&nbsp; To-day is quite full enough of anxiety, of care, of
toil, of ignorance.&nbsp; Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.&nbsp;
Yes; and sufficient for the day is the good thereof likewise.&nbsp;
To-day, and to-morrow, too, may end very differently from what he hoped.&nbsp;
Yes; but they may end, too, very differently from what he feared.&nbsp;
Let him throw his whole soul into the thing which he is about, and leave
the rest to God.</p>
<p>For so only will he come to the day&rsquo;s end in that wholesome
and manful temper, contented if not cheerful, satisfied with the work
he has had to do, if not satisfied with the way in which he has done
it, which will leave his mind free to remember all his comforts, all
his blessings, even to those commonest of all blessings, which we are
all too apt to forget, just because they are as necessary as the air
we breathe; which will show him how much light there is, even on the
darkest day.</p>
<p>He has not got this or that fine thing, it may be, for which he longed:
but he has at least his life, at least his reason, at least his conscience,
at least his God.&nbsp; Are not they enough to possess?&nbsp; Are not
they enough wherewith to lie down at night in peace, and rise to-morrow
to take what comes to-morrow, even as he took what came to-day?&nbsp;
And will he not be most fit to take what comes to-morrow like a Christian
man, whether it be good or evil, with his spirit braced and yet chastened,
by honest and patient labour, instead of being weakened and irritated
by idling over to-day, while he dreamed and fretted about to-morrow?</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; I fancy that I hear some one say&mdash;perhaps a woman&mdash;&ldquo;So
easy to preach, but so difficult to practise.&nbsp; So difficult to
think of one thing at a time.&nbsp; So difficult not to plot, not to
fret, with a whole family of children dependent on you!&nbsp; What does
the preacher know of a woman&rsquo;s troubles?&nbsp; How many things
she has to think of, day by day, not one of which she dares forget&mdash;and
yet can seldom or never, for all her recollecting, contrive to get them
all done?&nbsp; How can she help being distracted by the thought of
to-morrow?&nbsp; Can he feel for frail me?&nbsp; Does he know what I
go through?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I do know; and I wonder, and admire.&nbsp;
To me the sight of any poor woman managing her family respectably and
thriftily, is one of the most surprising sights on earth, as it is one
of the most beautiful sights on earth.&nbsp; How she finds time for
it, wit for it, patience for it, courage for it, I cannot conceive.&nbsp;
I have wondered often why many a woman does not lie down and die, for
sheer weariness of body and soul.&nbsp; I have fancied often that God
must give some special grace to all good mothers, to enable them to
do all that they do, and bear all they bear.&nbsp; But still, the women
who do most, who bring up their families best, are surely those who
obey their Lord&rsquo;s command, who give their whole souls to each
day&rsquo;s work, and think as little as they can of to-morrow.&nbsp;
With them, surely, the true wisdom is, not to fret, not to plot, to
do the duty which lies nearest them, and leave the rest to God; to get
each week&rsquo;s bill paid, trusting to God to send money for the week
to come; to get their children every day to school; to correct in them
each fault as it shews itself, without looking forward too much to how
the child will turn out at last.&nbsp; For them, and for parents of
all ranks, the wisest plan, I believe, is to make no far-fetched plans
for their children&rsquo;s future, certainly no ambitious intrigues
for their marriage: but simply to educate them&mdash;that is, to bring
out in them, day by day, all that is purest and best, wisest and ablest,
and leave the rest to God; sure that if they are worth anything, their
Father in heaven will find them work to do, and a place at His table,
in this life and in the life to come.</p>
<p>Yes, my dear friends, this is the true philosophy, the philosophy
which Christ preaches to us all&mdash;to old and young, rich and poor,
ploughman and scholar, maid, wife, and widow, all alike.</p>
<p>Fret not.&nbsp; Plot not.&nbsp; Look not too far ahead.</p>
<p>Fret not&mdash;lest you lose temper, and be moved to do evil.&nbsp;
Plot not&mdash;lest you lose faith in God, and be moved to be dishonest.&nbsp;
Look not too far ahead&mdash;So far only, as to keep yourselves out
of open and certain danger&mdash;lest you see what is coming before
you are ready for the sight.&nbsp; If we foresaw the troubles which
may be coming, perhaps it would break our hearts; and if we foresaw
the happiness which is coming, perhaps it would turn our heads.&nbsp;
Let us not meddle with the future, and matters which are too high for
us, but refrain our souls, and keep them low, like little children,
content with the day&rsquo;s food, and the day&rsquo;s schooling, and
the day&rsquo;s play-hours, sure that the Divine Master knows that all
is right, and how to train us, and whither to lead us, though we know
not, and need not know, save this&mdash;that the path by which He is
leading each of us&mdash;if we will but obey and follow, step by step&mdash;leads
up to Everlasting Life.</p>

<h2>SERMON XL.&nbsp; THE LESSON OF LIFE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Fifth Sunday in Lent.</p>
<p><i>Chester Training College</i>, 1870.&nbsp; <i>Windsor Castle</i>,
1871.</p>
<p>Hebrews v. 7, 8.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who in the days of His flesh, when
He had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears,
unto Him that was able to save Him from death, and was heard in that
He feared; though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things
which He suffered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the lesson of life.&nbsp; This is God&rsquo;s way of educating
us, of making us men and women worthy of the name of men and women,
worthy of the name of children of God.&nbsp; As Christ learnt, so must
we.&nbsp; If it was necessary for Him who know no sin, how much more
for us who have sins enough and to spare.&nbsp; Though He was the eternal
Son of God, yet He learnt obedience by the things which He suffered.&nbsp;
Though we are God&rsquo;s adopted children, we must learn obedience
by what we suffer.&nbsp; He had to offer up prayer with strong crying.&nbsp;
So shall we have to do again and again before we die.&nbsp; He was heard
in that He feared God, and said, &ldquo;Father not my will, but Thine
be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so shall we.&nbsp; He was perfected by sufferings.&nbsp;
God grant that we may be so likewise.&nbsp; He had to do like us.&nbsp;
God grant that we may do like Him.</p>
<p>God grant it.&nbsp; That is all I can say.&nbsp; I cannot be sure
of it, for myself or for any of you.&nbsp; I can only hope, and trust
in God.&nbsp; Life is hard work&mdash;any life at least which is worth
being called life, which is not the life of a swine, who thinks of nothing
but feeding himself, or of a butterfly which thinks of nothing but enjoying
itself.&nbsp; Those are easy lives enough: but the end thereof is death.&nbsp;
The swine goes to the slaughter.&nbsp; The butterfly dies of the frost&mdash;and
there is an end of them.&nbsp; But the manly life, the life of good
deeds and noble thoughts, and usefulness, and purity, the life which
is discontented with itself, and which the better it is, longs the more
to be better still; the life which will endure through this world into
the world to come, and on and upward for ever and for ever.&mdash;That
life is not an easy life to live; it is very often not a pleasant life;
very often a sad life&mdash;so sad that that is true of it which the
great poet says&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Who ne&rsquo;er his bread in sorrow ate,<br />Who never in
the midnight hours<br />Sat weeping on his lonely bed,<br />He knows
you not, you Heavenly Powers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>You may say this is bad news.&nbsp; I do not believe it is.&nbsp;
I believe it is good news, and the very best of news: but if it is bad
news, I cannot help it.&nbsp; I did not make it so.&nbsp; God made it
so.&nbsp; And God must know best.&nbsp; God is love.&nbsp; And we are
His children, and He loves us.&nbsp; And therefore His ways with us
must be good and loving ways, and any news about them must be good news,
and a gospel, though we cannot see it so at first.</p>
<p>In any case, if it is so, it is better to remember that it is so.&nbsp;
And Lent, and Passion Week, and Good Friday are meant to put us in mind
of it year by year, because we are all of us only too ready to forget
it, and shut our eyes to it.&nbsp; Lent and Passion Week, I say, are
meant to put us in mind.&nbsp; And the preacher is bound to put you
in mind of it now and then.&nbsp; He is bound, not too often perhaps,
lest he should discourage young hearts, but now and then, to put you
in mind of the old Greek proverb, the very words of which St. Paul uses
in the text, that &tau;&alpha; &pi;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;
&mu;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&mdash;sorrows are lessons;
and that the most truly pitiable people often are those who have no
sorrows, and ask for no man&rsquo;s pity.</p>
<p>For so it is.&nbsp; The very worst calamity, I should say, which
could befall any human being would be this&mdash;To have his own way
from his cradle to his grave; to have everything he liked for the asking,
or even for the buying; never to be forced to say, &ldquo;I should like
that: but I cannot afford it.&nbsp; I should like this: but I must not
do it&rdquo;&mdash;Never to deny himself, never to exert himself, never
to work, and never to want.&nbsp; That man&rsquo;s soul would be in
as great danger as if he were committing great crimes.&nbsp; Indeed,
he would very probably before he died commit great crimes&mdash;like
certain negroes whom I have seen abroad, who live a life of such lazy
comfort and safety, and superabundance of food, that they are beginning
more and more to live the life of animals rather than men.&nbsp; They
are like those of whom the Psalmist says, &ldquo;Their eyes swell out
with fatness, and they do even what they lust.&rdquo;&nbsp; So do they,
and indulge in gross vices, which, if not checked in some way, will
end in destroying them off the face of the earth in a few generations
more.&nbsp; I had rather, for the sake of my character, my manhood,
my immortal soul, I had rather, I say, a hundred times over, be an English
labourer, struggling on on twelve shillings a week, and learning obedience,
self-denial, self-respect, and trust in God, by the things suffered
in that hard life here at home, than be a Negro in Tropic islands, fattening
himself in sloth under that perpetual sunshine, and thinking nought
of God, because, poor fool, he can get all he wants without God&rsquo;s
help.</p>
<p>No, my dear young friends, this is good for a man.&nbsp; It is necessary
for a man, if he is to be a man and a child of God, and not a mere animal,
to have to work hard whether he likes or not.&nbsp; It is good for a
man to bear the yoke in his youth, as Jeremiah told the Jews, when,
because they would not bear God&rsquo;s light yoke in their youth, but
ran riot into luxury and wantonness, and superstition and idolatry which
come thereof, they had to bear the heavy yoke of the Babylonish captivity
in their old age.&nbsp; It is good for a man to be checked, crossed,
disappointed, made to feel his own ignorance, weakness, folly; made
to feel his need of God; to feel that, in spite of all his cunning and
self-confidence, he is no better off in this world than a lost child
in a dark forest, unless he has a Father in Heaven, who loves him with
an eternal love, and a Holy Spirit in Heaven, who will give him a right
judgment in all things; who will put into his mind good desires, and
enable him to bring those desires to good effect; and a Saviour in Heaven
who can be touched with the feeling of his infirmities, because He too
was made perfect by sufferings; He too was tempted in all points like
as we are, yet without sin.</p>
<p>And, therefore, my dear friends, those words which we read in the
Visitation of the Sick about this matter are not mere kind words, meant
to give comfort for the moment.&nbsp; They are truth and fact and sound
philosophy.&nbsp; They are as true for the young lad in health and spirits
as for the old folk crawling towards their graves.&nbsp; It is true,
and you will find it true, that sickness and all sorts of troubles,
are sent to correct and amend in us whatever doth offend the eyes of
our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; It is true, and you will find it true, that
whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He
receiveth.&nbsp; It is true, and you will find it true (though God knows
it is a difficult lesson enough to learn), that there should be no greater
comfort to Christian persons, than to be made like Christ, by suffering
patiently not only the hard work of every-day life, but adversities,
troubles, and sicknesses, and our Heavenly Father&rsquo;s correction,
whensoever, by any manner of adversity, it shall please His gracious
goodness to visit them.&nbsp; For Christ Himself went not up to joy,
but first He suffered pain; He entered not into His glory, before He
was crucified.</p>
<p>So truly our way to eternal joy is to labour and to suffer here with
Christ.&nbsp; It is true, and you will find it true, when years hence
you look back, as I trust you all will, calmly and intelligently, on
the events of your own lives&mdash;you will find, I say, that the very
events in your lives which seemed at the time most trying, most vexing,
most disastrous, have been those which wore most necessary for you,
to call out what was good in you, and to purge out what was bad; that
by those very troubles your Lord, who knows the value of suffering,
because He has suffered Himself, was making true men, true women of
you; hardening your heads, while He softened your hearts; teaching you
to obey Him, while He taught you not to obey your own fancies and your
own passions; refining and tempering your characters in the furnace
of trial, as the smith refines soft iron into trusty steel; teaching
you, as the great poet says&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That life is not as idle ore,<br />But heated
hot with burning fears,<br />And bathed in baths of hissing tears,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
battered with the strokes of doom,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shape and
use.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Yes, you will learn that, and more than that, and say in peace&mdash;&ldquo;Before
I was troubled I went wrong, but now have I kept thy commandments.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And to such an old age may our Lord Jesus Christ bring you and me and
all we love.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON XLI.&nbsp; SACRIFICE TO C&AElig;SAR OR TO GOD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, 1869.&nbsp; <i>Chester Cathedral</i>, 1872.</p>
<p>Matthew xxii. 21.&nbsp; &ldquo;Render therefore unto C&aelig;sar
the things which are C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s; and unto God the things that
are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many a sermon has been preached, and many a pamphlet written, on
this text, and (as too often has happened to Holy Scripture), it has
been made to mean the most opposite doctrines, and twisted in every
direction, to suit men&rsquo;s opinions and superstitions.&nbsp; Some
have found in it a command to obey tyrants, invaders, any and every
government, just or unjust.&nbsp; Others have found in it rules for
drawing a line between the authority of the State and of the Church,
<i>i.e</i>., between what the Government have a right to command, and
what the Clergy have a right to demand; and many more matters have they
fancied that they discovered in the text which I do not believe are
in it at all.</p>
<p>For to understand the original question&mdash;Is it lawful to pay
tribute to C&aelig;sar or no? we must imagine to ourselves a state of
things in Judea utterly different, thank God, from anything which has
been in these realms for now eight hundred years.&nbsp; The C&aelig;sar,
or Emperor of Rome, had obtained by conquest an authority over the Jews
very like that which we have over the Hindoos in India.&nbsp; And what
was working in the mind of the Jews was very like that which was working
in the minds of the Hindoos in the Sepoy Rebellion&mdash;whether it
was not a sacred and religious duty to rise against their conquerors
and drive them out.&nbsp; We know from the New Testament that both our
Lord and His apostles again and again warned them not to rebel, warned
them that they would not succeed: but ruin themselves thereby; for that
those who took the sword would perish by the sword.&nbsp; And we know,
too, that the Jews would not take our Lord&rsquo;s advice, nor the apostles&rsquo;,
but did rise again and again, both in Judea and elsewhere, gallantly
and desperately enough, poor creatures, in mad useless rebellion, till
the Romans all but destroyed them off the face of the earth.&nbsp; But
what has that to do with us, free self-governed Englishmen, in this
peaceful and prosperous land?&nbsp; In the early middle age, when the
clergy represented and defended Roman pure Christianity and civilization
against the half-heathen and half-barbaric Teutons who had conquered
the Roman Empire, then doubtless the text became once more full of meaning,
and the clergy had again and again to defend the things which belonged
to God against the rapacity or the wilfulness of many a barbaric C&aelig;sar.&nbsp;
But what has that, again, to do with us?&nbsp; Those who apply the text
to any questions which can at present arise between the Church and the
State, mistake alike, it seems to me, the nature and functions of an
Established Church, and the nature and functions of a free Government.</p>
<p>Do I mean, then, that the text has nothing to do with us?&nbsp; God
forbid!&nbsp; I believe that every word of our Lord&rsquo;s has to do
with us, and with every human being, for their meaning is infinite,
eternal, and inexhaustible.&nbsp; And what the latter half of the text
has to do with us, I will try to show you, while I tell you openly,
that the first half of it, about rendering to C&aelig;sar the things
which are C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s, has nothing to do with us, and never
need, save through our own cowardice and effeminacy, or folly.</p>
<p>We have no C&aelig;sar over us in free England, and shall not have,
while Queen Victoria, and her children after her reign; but if ever
one, or many (which God forbid!), should arise and try to set themselves
up as despots over us, I trust we shall know how to render them their
due, be they native or foreigner, in the same coin in which our forefathers
have always paid tyrants and invaders.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The only C&aelig;sar
which we have to fear&mdash;and he is a tyrant who seems ready, nowadays,
to oppose and exalt himself above all that is called God, or is worshipped,&mdash;patronizing,
of course, Religion, as a harmless sanction for order and respectability,
but dictating morality, while telling us all day long, with a thousand
voices and a thousand pens&mdash;&ldquo;Right is not the eternal law
of God.&nbsp; Whatever profits me, whatever I like, whatever I vote&mdash;that
and that alone is right, and you must do it at your peril.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Do you know who that C&aelig;sar is, my friends?&nbsp; He is called
Public Opinion&mdash;the huge anonymous idol which we ourselves help
to make, and then tremble before the creation of our own cowardice;
whereas, if we will but face him, in the fear of God and the faith of
Christ, determined to say the thing which is true, and do the thing
which is right, we shall find the modern C&aelig;sar but a phantom of
our own imagination; a tyrant, indeed, as long as he is feared, but
a coward as soon as he is defied.</p>
<p>To that C&aelig;sar let us never bow the knee.&nbsp; Render to him
all that he deserves&mdash;the homage of common courtesy, common respectability,
common charity&mdash;not in reverence for his wisdom and strength, but
in pity for his ignorance and weakness.&nbsp; But render always to God
the things which are God&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That duty, my good friends,
lies on us, as on all mankind still, from our cradle to our grave, and
after that through all eternity.&nbsp; Let us go back, or rather, let
us go home to the eternal laws of God, which were, ages before we were
born, and will be, ages after we are dead&mdash;to the everlasting Rock
on which we all stand, which is the will and mind of our Lord Jesus
Christ the Son of God, to whom all power is given (as He said Himself)
in heaven and on earth.&nbsp; And we have need to do so, for in such
times of change as these are, there will always be too many who fancy
that changes in society and government change their duty about religion,
and are, some of them, sorely puzzled as to their duty to God: and others
ready to take advantage of the change to throw off their duty to God,
and run into licence and schism and fanaticism.</p>
<p>Now let all people clearly understand, and settle it in their hearts,
that no change in Church or in State can change in the least their duty
to God and to man.&nbsp; If the world were turned upside down, God would
still be where He is, and we where we are&mdash;in His presence.&nbsp;
Right would still be right, my friends, and wrong wrong, though all
the loud voices in the world shouted that wrong is right and right wrong.&nbsp;
No change of time, place, society, government, circumstance of any kind,
can alter our duty to God, and our power of doing that duty.&nbsp; Whatever
the C&aelig;sar of the hour may require us to render to him, what we
are bound to render to God remains the same.&nbsp; The two things are
different <i>in kind</i>, so different, that they never need interfere
with each other.</p>
<p>Even if, which God forbid, the connection between Church and State
were dissolved; even if, which God forbid, the Church of England were
destroyed for a while&mdash;if all Churches were destroyed&mdash;yea,
if not a place of worship were left for a while in this or any other
land; yet even then, I say, we could still render to God the things
which are God&rsquo;s, and offer to Him spiritual sacrifices, more pleasing
to Him than the most gorgeous ceremonies which the devotion, and art,
and wealth of man ever devised&mdash;sacrifices, by virtue of which
the Church would arise out of her ruins, like the Jewish Church after
the captivity, more pure, more glorious, and more triumphant than ever.</p>
<p>What do I mean?&nbsp; I mean this&mdash;that there are three sacrifices
which every man, woman, and child can offer, and should offer, however
lowly, however uneducated in what the world calls education nowadays.&nbsp;
Those they can offer to God, and with them they can worship God, and
render to God the things which are God&rsquo;s, wherever they are, whatever
they are doing, whatever be the laws of their country, or the state
of society round them.&nbsp; For of these sacrifices our Lord Himself
said, The true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in
truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship Him.</p>
<p>Now what are these spiritual sacrifices?</p>
<p>First and foremost, surely, the sacrifice of repentance, of which
it is written, &ldquo;The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.&nbsp;
A broken and a contrite heart, oh God, Thou wilt not despise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Surely when we&mdash;even the best of us&mdash;look back on our past
lives; when we recollect, if not great and positive sins and crimes,
yet the opportunities which we have neglected; the time, and often the
money which we have wasted; the meannesses, the tempers, the spite,
the vanity, the selfishness, which we have too often indulged&mdash;When
we think of what we have been, and what we might have been, what we
are, and what we might be; when we measure ourselves, not by the paltry,
low, and often impure standard of the world around us, but by the pure,
lofty, truly heroical standard of our Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;what can
we say, but that we are miserable&mdash;that is, pitiful and pitiable
sinners, who have left undone what we ought to have done, and done that
which we ought not to have done, till there is no health in us?</p>
<p>And if you ask me, How is it a sacrifice to God to confess to Him
that we are sinners? the answer is simple.&nbsp; It is a sacrifice to
God, and a sacrifice well-pleasing to Him, simply because it is The
Truth.&nbsp; God wants nothing from us; we can give Him nothing.&nbsp;
The wild beasts of the forest are His, and so are the cattle on a thousand
hills.&nbsp; If He be hungry He will not tell us for the whole world
is His and all that is therein.&nbsp; But what He asks is, that for
our own sakes we should see the truth about ourselves, see what we really
are, and sacrifice that self-conceit which prevents our seeing ourselves
as God our Father sees us.&nbsp; And why does that please God?&nbsp;
Simply because it puts us in our right state, and in our right place,
where we can begin to become better men, let us be as bad as we may.&nbsp;
If a man be a fool, the best possible thing for him is that he should
find out that he is a fool, and confess that he is a fool, as the first,
and the absolutely necessary first step to becoming wise.&nbsp; Therefore
repentance, contrition, humility, is the very foundation-stone of all
goodness, virtue, holiness, usefulness; and God desires to see us contrite,
simply because He desires to see us good men and good women.</p>
<p>Next, the sacrifice of thankfulness, of which it is written, &ldquo;I
will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon
the name of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again&mdash;By Christ let us
offer the sacrifice of praise continually, that is, the fruit of our
lips, giving thanks unto His name.&nbsp; Ah! my friends, if we offered
that sacrifice oftener, we should have more seldom need to offer the
first sacrifice of repentance.&nbsp; I am astonished when I look at
my own heart, by which alone I can judge the hearts of others, to see
how unthankful one is.&nbsp; How one takes as a matter of course, without
one aspiration of gratitude to our Father in heaven&mdash;how one takes,
as a matter of course, I say, life, health, reason, freedom, education,
comfort, safety, and all the blessings of humanity, and of this favoured
land.&nbsp; How we never really feel that these are all God&rsquo;s
undeserved and unearned mercies; and then, how, if we set our hearts
on anything which we have not got, forget all that we have already,
and begin entreating God to give us something which, if we had, we know
not whether it would be good for us; like children crying peevishly
for sweets, after their parents have given them all the wholesome food
they need.&nbsp; Ah! that we would offer to God more frankly the sacrifice
of thanksgiving!&nbsp; So we should do God justice, by confessing all
we owe to Him; and so, we must believe, we should please God; for if
God be indeed our Father in heaven, as surely as a parent is pleased
with the affection and gratitude of his child, so will our Father in
heaven be pleased when He sees us love Him, who first loved us.</p>
<p>Next&mdash;the sacrifice of righteousness, of which it is written,
&ldquo;Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God,
which is your reasonable service.&rdquo;&nbsp; To be good and to do
good, even to long to be good and to long to do good, to hunger and
thirst after righteousness, is the best and highest sacrifice which
any human being can offer to his Father in heaven.&nbsp; For so he honours
his father most truly; for he longs and strives to be like that Father;
to be good as God is good, holy as God is holy, beneficent and useful
even as God is infinitely beneficent and useful; being, in one word,
perfect, as his Father in heaven is perfect.&nbsp; This is the best
and highest act of worship, the truest devotion.&nbsp; For pure worship
(says St James), and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, to
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep ourselves
unspotted from the world.</p>
<p>Yes&mdash;every time we perform an act of kindness to any human being,
aye, even to a dumb animal; every time we conquer our own worldliness,
love of pleasure, ease, praise, ambition, money, for the sake of doing
what our conscience tells us to be our duty, we are indeed worshipping
God the Father in spirit and in truth, and offering him a sacrifice
which He will surely accept, for the sake of His beloved Son, by whose
spirit all good deeds and thoughts are inspired.</p>
<p>Think of these things, my friends, always, but, above all, think
of them as often as you come&mdash;as would to God all would come&mdash;to
the altar of the Lord, and the Holy Communion of His body and blood.&nbsp;
For there, indeed, you render to God that which is God&rsquo;s&mdash;namely,
yourselves; there you offer to God the true sacrifice, which is the
sacrifice of yourselves&mdash;the sacrifice of repentance, the sacrifice
of thanksgiving, the sacrifice of righteousness, or at least of hunger
and thirst after righteousness; and there you receive in return your
share of God&rsquo;s sacrifice, the sacrifice which you did not make
for Him, but which He made for you, when He spared not His only-begotten
Son but freely gave Him for us.</p>
<p>That is the sacrifice of all sacrifices, the wonder of all wonders,
the mystery of all mysteries; and it is also the righteousness of all
righteousness, the generosity of all generosity, the nobleness of all
nobleness, the beauty of all beauty, the love of all love.&nbsp; Thinking
of that, beholding in that bread and wine the tokens of the boundless
love of God, then surely, surely, our repentance for past follies, our
thankfulness for present blessings, our longing to be good, pure, useful,
humane, generous, high-minded&mdash;in one word, to be holy&mdash;ought
to rise up in us, into a passion, as it were, of noble shame at our
own selfishness, and admiration of God&rsquo;s unselfishness, a longing
to follow His divine example, and to live, not for ourselves, but for
our fellow-men.&nbsp; If we could but once understand the full meaning
of those awful yet glorious words, &ldquo;He that spared not His own
Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also
freely give us all things?&rdquo; then, indeed, we should understand
that the one overpowering reason for being unselfish and doing good
is this&mdash;that we are God&rsquo;s children, and that God our Father
is utterly unselfish, and utterly does good, even at the sacrifice of
Himself; and that therefore when we are unselfish, and do good, even
at the sacrifice of ourselves, we do indeed, in spirit and in truth,
&ldquo;render unto God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON XLII.&nbsp; THE UNJUST STEWARD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Eversley</i>, 1866.&nbsp; NINTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY.</p>
<p>Luke xvi. 8.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the Lord commended the unjust steward,
because he had done wisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of our Lord&rsquo;s parables has been as difficult to explain
as this one.&nbsp; Learned and pious men have confessed freely, in all
ages, that there is much in the parable which they cannot understand;
and I am bound to confess the same.&nbsp; The puzzle is, plainly, why
our Lord should <i>seem</i> to bid us to copy the conduct of a bad man
and a cheat.&nbsp; For this is the usual interpretation.&nbsp; The steward
has been cheating his master already.&nbsp; When he is found out and
about to be dismissed, he cheats his master still further, by telling
his debtors to cheat, and so wins favour with them.</p>
<p>But does our Lord bid us copy a cheat?&nbsp; I cannot believe that;
and the text I should have said ought to give us a very different notion.&nbsp;
We read that the lord&mdash;that is, the steward&rsquo;s master&mdash;commended
the unjust steward.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Commended him for cheating him
a second time, and teaching his debtors to cheat him?&nbsp; He must
have been a man of a strange character&mdash;very unlike any man whom
we know, or, at all events, any man whom we should wish to know&mdash;to
have done that.&nbsp; But it is said&mdash;he commended him for having
acted wisely.&nbsp; Now that word &ldquo;wisely&rdquo; may merely mean
prudently, sensibly, and with common sense.&nbsp; But if the master
thought that to cheat, or to teach others to cheat, was acting either
wisely or prudently, then he was a very foolish and short-sighted man,
and altogether mistaken.&nbsp; For be sure and certain, and settle it
in your minds, that neither falsehood or dishonesty is ever either wise
or prudent, but short-sighted, foolish, certain to punish itself.&nbsp;
Such teaching is totally contrary to our Lord&rsquo;s own teaching.&nbsp;
Agree with thine adversary quickly, He says, while thou art in the way
with him, lest he deliver thee to the Judge.&nbsp; If thou hast done
wrong, right it again as soon as possible; for your sin will surely
find you out, and avenge itself.&nbsp; Give the devil his due, says
the good old proverb.&nbsp; Pay him at once and be done with him: but
never think to escape out of his clutches, as too many wretched and
foolish sinners do, by running up a fresh score with him, and trying
to hide old sins by new ones.&nbsp; Be sure that if the steward cheated
his master a second time, the master was foolish and mistaken, and as
it were a partner in the steward&rsquo;s sin by commending him.&nbsp;
But if so; why does our Lord mention it?&nbsp; What had our Lord to
do, what have we to do, with the opinion of so foolish a man?</p>
<p>It seems to me that the only reason for our Lord&rsquo;s using the
words of the text, must be, that the master was right, not wrong, in
commending the steward.&nbsp; But it seems to me, also, that the master
could be right only, if the steward was right also&mdash;if the steward
had done the right and just thing at last, and, instead of cheating
his master a second time, had done his best to make restitution for
his own sins.</p>
<p>But how could that be?&nbsp; We know nothing of what these debtors
were.&nbsp; All we know is that one believed that he owed the Lord a
hundred measures of oil; and another believed that he owed him a hundred
measures of wheat; and that the steward told one to put down in his
bill eighty, and the other fifty.&nbsp; Now suppose that the steward
had been cheating and oppressing these men, as was common enough in
those days with stewards, and has been common enough since; suppose
that he had been charging them more than they really owed, and, it may
be, putting the surplus into his own pocket, and so wasting his master&rsquo;s
goods&mdash;that the one really owed only eighty measures of oil, and
the other really owed only fifty of wheat; what could be more simple,
or more truly wise either, when he was found out, than to do this&mdash;to
go round to the debtors and confess: I have been overcharging you; you
do not owe what I have demanded of you; take your bill and write four-score,
for that is what you really owe?</p>
<p>This is but a guess on my part.&nbsp; But all other explanations
are only guesses likewise, because we do not know how business was transacted
in those days and in that country.&nbsp; We do not know whether these
debtors were tenants, paying rent in kind, or traders to whom goods
had been advanced, or what they were.&nbsp; We do not know whether the
steward was agent of the estate, or house steward, or what he was.&nbsp;
But this we do know&mdash;that to mend one act of villainy by committing
a fresh one, is not wisdom, but foolishness; and we may be sure that
our Lord would never have held up the unjust steward as an example to
us, or quoted his master&rsquo;s opinion of him, if all he did was to
commit fraud on fraud, and make bad worse, thereby risking his own more
utter ruin.&nbsp; And this view of the parable surely agrees with our
Lord&rsquo;s own lesson, which He draws from it.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I
say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But what does that mean?&nbsp; Wise men have been puzzled by that text
as much as by the parable; but surely our Lord Himself explains it in
the verses which follow: &ldquo;He that is faithful in that which is
least, is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in that which
is least, is unjust also in much.&rdquo;&nbsp; He that is <i>faithful</i>.&nbsp;
The unjust steward was commended for acting wisely.&nbsp; Now, it seems
the way to act wisely is to act faithfully&mdash;that is honestly.&nbsp;
Our Lord bids us copy the unjust steward, and make ourselves friends
of the mammon of unrighteousness.&nbsp; Now, it seems, He tells us that
the way to make friends of men by money transactions is to deal faithfully
and honestly by them.&nbsp; This then was perhaps why the Lord commended
the unjust steward, because he had been converted in time, and seen
his true interest; and for once at least in his life become just.&nbsp;
He had found out that after all, honesty is the best policy; as God
grant all of us may find out if any of us have not found it out already.&nbsp;
Honesty is the best policy.&nbsp; Faithfulness, as our Lord calls it,
is the true wisdom.&nbsp; And in that, as our Lord says, the children
of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.&nbsp;
The children of this world, the plain worldly men of business, find
that to conduct their business they must be faithful, diligent, punctual,
accurate, cautious, business-like.&nbsp; They must have practical common
sense, which is itself a kind of honesty.&nbsp; They must be men of
their word, just and true in their dealings, or sooner or later, they
will fail.&nbsp; Their schemes, their money, their credit, their character,
will fail them, and they will be overwhelmed by ruin.</p>
<p>And that is just what too often the children of light forget.&nbsp;
The children of light have a higher light, a deeper teaching from God,
than the children of the world.&nbsp; They have a great insight into
what ought to be; they see that mankind might be far wiser, happier,
better, holier than they are; they have noble and lofty hopes for the
future; they desire the welfare and the holiness of mankind.&nbsp; But
they are too apt to want practical common sense.&nbsp; And so they are
laughed at (and deservedly) as dreamers, as fanatics, as foolish unpractical
people, who are wasting their talents on impossible fancies.&nbsp; Often
while their minds are full of really useful and noble schemes, they
neglect their business, their families, their common duties, till they
cause misery to those around them, and shame to themselves.&nbsp; Often,
too, they are tempted to be actually dishonest, to fancy that the means
sanctify the end; that it is lawful to do evil that good may come; and
so, in order to carry out some fine scheme of theirs, to say false things,
or do mean or cruel things, not for their own interest, but, as they
fancy, for the cause of God: as if God, and God&rsquo;s cause, could
ever be helped by the devil and his works.&nbsp; And so they cast a
scandal on religion, and give the enemies of the Lord reason to blaspheme.&nbsp;
So it was, it seems, in our Lord&rsquo;s time&mdash;so it has been too
often since.&nbsp; The children of light&mdash;those who ought to be
of most use to their own generation&mdash;are sometimes of least use
to it, through their own weaknesses and follies.&nbsp; They will not
remember that he that is not faithful in that which is least, in the
every-day concerns of life, is not likely to be faithful in that which
is greatest; that if they will not be faithful in the unrighteous mammon&mdash;that
is, if they cannot resist the temptations to meanness and unfairness
which come with all money transactions, God will not commit to them
the true riches&mdash;the power of making their fellow creatures wiser,
happier, better.&nbsp; If they will not be faithful in that which is
another man&rsquo;s&mdash;in plain English, if they will not pay their
debts honestly, who will give them that which is their own&mdash;the
inspiration of God&rsquo;s indwelling Spirit?&nbsp; Would to God all
high religious professors would recollect that, and be just and honest,
before they pretend to higher graces and counsels of perfection.</p>
<p>This lesson, then, I think our Lord means to teach us.&nbsp; I do
not say it is the only lesson in the parable; God forbid.&nbsp; But
I think that our Lord&rsquo;s own words show us that this <i>is</i>
one lesson.&nbsp; That, however pious we are, however enlightened we
are, however useful we wish to be; in one word, however much we are,
or fancy ourselves to be, children of light, our first duty as Christian
men is the duty which lies nearest us&mdash;that of which it is written:
&ldquo;If a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take
care of the Church of God?&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;If any provide
not for his own and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied
the faith, and is worse than an infidel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our first duty,
I say, as Christian men, is to be just and honest in money matters and
every-day business; and over and above that, to be generous and liberal
therein.&nbsp; Not merely to pay&mdash;which the very publicans in our
Lord&rsquo;s time did&mdash;but to give, generously, liberally; lending,
if we can afford it, as our Lord bids us, hoping for nothing again;
and remembering that he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord,
and whatsoever he layeth out, it shall be repaid him again.</p>
<p>Yes, my friends, we must all needs take our Lord&rsquo;s advice&mdash;make
to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye
fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.&nbsp; <i>When
ye fail&mdash;</i>literally, when you are eclipsed, as the sun is eclipsed.&nbsp;
That must happen to all of us, to the best, the wisest, the most famous.&nbsp;
Each must be eclipsed, and passed in the race of life, and forgotten
for some younger man.&nbsp; Each in turn must fail.&nbsp; One may fail
in money&mdash;the mammon for which he toiled may take to itself wings
and fly away; or he may fail in his plans, noble plans, and useful though
they seemed; and he may find, as he grows old, that the world has not
gone <i>his</i> way, but quite another one; or he may fail in health,
and be cut down and crippled, and laid by in the midst of his work.&nbsp;
And even if he escapes all these disasters, he must needs fail at last,
by mere old age, when the days come &ldquo;when thou shalt say, I have
no pleasure in them;&rdquo; when the sun and the light are darkened,
and the clouds return after the rain, when the strong men bow themselves,
and those who look out of the windows are dark; and he shall rise up
at the voice of a bird, and fears shall be in the way, and the grasshopper
shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long
home, and the mourners go about the streets.&nbsp; Think for yourselves.&nbsp;
What would you wish your end to be&mdash;lonely, unhappy, without the
love, the respect, the care of your fellow-men; or surrounded by friends
who comfort your failing body and soul on earth, and receive you at
last into everlasting habitations?</p>
<p>Make friends, make friends against that day, whether or not you make
them out of the mammon of unrighteousness.&nbsp; If you have been unrighteous,
bring friends back to you, as the steward did, by being just and fair,
by confessing your faults freely, by doing your best to atone for them.&nbsp;
And if you have no share in the mammon of unrighteousness, still make
friends.&nbsp; Make them by truth and justice, make them by generosity
and usefulness.&nbsp; To ease every burden, and let the oppressed go
free, to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and what the very poorest
can do&mdash;comfort the mourner; to nurse the sick, to visit the fatherless
and widows in their affliction, and so keep ourselves unspotted from
the selfishness of the world&mdash;This is that true Religion, acceptable
in the sight of God the Father&mdash;and happy he who has so served
God.&nbsp; Happy for him, when he begins to fail, to see round him attached
hearts, and grateful faces, hands ready to tend him, as he has tended
others.&nbsp; And happier still to remember that on the other side of
the dark river of death are other grateful faces, other loving hearts,
ready to welcome him into everlasting habitations&mdash;and among them,
and above them all, one whose form is as the Son of Man, full of all
humanity Himself, and loving and rewarding all humanity in His creatures,
saying, &ldquo;Inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these my
brethren, ye have done it unto Me.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON XLIII.&nbsp; THE RICH AND THE POOR</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>Chapel Royal</i>, <i>Whitehall</i>, 1871.</p>
<p>Proverbs xxii. 2.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rich and poor meet together: the
Lord is the maker of them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been asked to preach here this afternoon on behalf of the
Parochial Mission Women&rsquo;s Fund.&nbsp; I may best describe the
object for which I plead, as an attempt to civilise and Christianise
the women of the lower classes in the poorer districts of London and
other great towns, by means of women of their own class&mdash;women,
who have gone through the same struggles as they have, and who will
be trusted by them to understand and to sympathize with their needs
and difficulties.&nbsp; These mission women are in communication with
lady-superintendents in each ecclesiastical district.&nbsp; These are,
I understand, usually the wives of small tradesmen, or of clerks.&nbsp;
They, again, are in communication with ladies at the West End of London,
who are willing to give personal help and money for certain objects,
but not indiscriminate alms.&nbsp; And thus a series of links is established
between the most prosperous and the least prosperous classes, by means
of which the rich and the poor may meet together, and learn&mdash;to
the infinite benefit of both&mdash;that the Lord is the maker of them
all.&nbsp; Considering this excellent scheme, I could not help seeing
as a background to it, a very different and a far darker scene.&nbsp;
I could not help remembering that during these very days, the poorer
classes of another great city had taken up an attitude full of awful
lessons to us, and to every civilized country upon earth.&nbsp; We have
been reading of a hundred thousand armed men encamped in the suburbs
of Belleville and Montmartre, with cannon and mitrailleuses, uttering
through their organs, threats which leave no doubt that the meaning
of this movement is&mdash;as some of them boldly phrase it,&mdash;a
war of the poor against the rich.&nbsp; There is no mistaking what that
means.&nbsp; This madness has been stopped for the time, we are told,
principally (as was to be expected), by the superior common sense of
their wives.&nbsp; But only, I fear, for a time.&nbsp; Such men will
go far, if not this time, then some other time.&nbsp; For they believe
what they say, and know what they want.&nbsp; They have done with phrases,
done with illusions.&nbsp; They are no longer deceived and hampered
by party cries against this and that grievance, real or imaginary, the
abolition of which the working classes demand so eagerly from time to
time, in the vain belief that if it were only got rid of the millennium
would be at hand.&nbsp; They have done long ago with remedial half-measures.&nbsp;
Landed aristocracy, Established Church, military classes, privileged
classes, restricted suffrage, and all the rest, have been abolished
in their country for two generations and more: but behold, the poor
man finds himself (or fancies himself, which is just as dangerous) no
richer, safer, happier after all, and begins to see a far simpler remedy
for all his ills.&nbsp; He has too little of this world&rsquo;s goods,
while others have too much.&nbsp; What more fair, more simple, than
that he should take some of the rich man&rsquo;s goods, and if he resists,
kill him, crying, &ldquo;Thou sayest, let me eat and drink, for to-morrow
I die.&nbsp; Then I too will eat and drink, for to-morrow <i>I</i> die?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And so will the rich and poor meet together with a vengeance, simply
because neither of them has learnt that the Lord is the maker of them
all.</p>
<p>This is a hideous conclusion.&nbsp; But it is one towards which the
poor will tend in every country in which the rich are merely rich, spending
their wealth in self-enjoyment, atoned for by a modicum of alms.</p>
<p>I said a modicum of alms.&nbsp; I ought to have said, any amount
of alms, any amount of charity.&nbsp; Throughout the great cities of
Europe&mdash;in London as much as anywhere&mdash;hundreds of thousands
are saying, &ldquo;We want no alms.&nbsp; We intend to reconstitute
society, even at the expense of blood, so that no man, woman, or child,
shall need the rich man&rsquo;s alms.&nbsp; We do not choose, for it
is not just, that he should take credit to himself for giving us a shilling
when he owes us a pound, ten, a hundred pounds&mdash;owes us, in fact,
all by which he and his class are richer than us and our class.&nbsp;
And we will make him pay his debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not say that such words are wise.&nbsp; I believe them to be
foolish&mdash;suicidal.&nbsp; I believe that it is those who patiently
wait on the Lord, and not the discontented who fret themselves till
they do evil, who will inherit the land, and be refreshed in peace.&nbsp;
I believe that all those who take the sword will perish by the sword;
that those who appeal to brute force will always find it&mdash;just
because it is brute force&mdash;always strongest on the side of the
rich, who can hire it for evil, as for good.</p>
<p>I only say, that so hundreds of thousands think; so they speak, and
will speak more and more loudly, as long as the present tone of society
endures,&mdash;good-natured and well meaning, but luxurious, covetous,
ignoble, frivolous, ignorant; believing&mdash;all classes alike, not
only that money makes the man, but worse far&mdash;that money makes
the woman also; and all the while half-ashamed of itself, half-distrustful
of itself, and trying to buy off man by alms, and God by superstition.</p>
<p>So long as the great mass of the poor of any city know nothing of
the great mass of the rich of that city, save as folk who roll past
them in their carriages, seemingly easy while they are struggling, seemingly
happy while they are wretched, so long will the rich of that city be
supposed, however falsely, to be what the French workmen used to call
<i>mangeurs d&rsquo;hommes</i>&mdash;<i>exploiteurs d&rsquo;hommes</i>&mdash;to
get their wealth by means of the poverty, their comfort by means of
the misery of their fellow-men; and so long will they be exposed to
that mere envy and hatred which pursues always the more prosperous,
till, in some national crisis, when the rich and poor meet together,
both parties will be but too apt to behave, through mutual fear and
hate, as if not God, but the devil, was the maker of them all.</p>
<p>These words are strong.&nbsp; How can they be too strong, in face
of what is now passing in a neighbouring land?&nbsp; Not too strong,
either, in view of the actual state of vast masses of the poor in London
itself, and indeed of any one of our great cities.</p>
<p>That matter has been reported on, preached on, spoken on, till all
other civilized countries reproach Britain with the unique contrast
between the exceeding wealth of some classes and the exceeding poverty
of others; till we, instead of being startled by the reproach, take
the present state of things as a matter of course, a physical necessity,
a law of nature and society, that there should be, in the back streets
of every great city, hordes of, must I say, savages? neither decently
civilized nor decently Christianized, uncertain, most of them, of regular
livelihood, and therefore shiftless and reckless, extravagant in prosperity,
and in adversity falling at once into want and pauperism.&nbsp; You
may ask any clergyman, any minister of religion of any denomination,
whether the thing is not so.&nbsp; Or if you want to read the latest
news about the degradation of your fellow-subjects, read a little book
called &ldquo;East and West,&rdquo; and judge for yourselves, whether
such a population, numbered by hundreds of thousands, are in a state
pleasing to God, or safe for those classes of whom they only know that
they pay them wages, and that these wages are as small as they can be
forced to take.&nbsp; Read that book; and then ask yourselves, is it
wonderful that, in one district, before the mission of the society for
which I plead was established, the poor used seriously to believe that
it was the wish and endeavour of the rich to grind them down, and keep
them poor.&nbsp; We, of course, know that the poor folk were mistaken
but do we not know, too&mdash;some of us&mdash;that there are political
economists in the world, who, though they would not willingly make the
poor poorer than they are, are still of opinion that it is good for
the nation, on the whole, that the present state of things should continue;
that there should be always a reserve of labour, in plain English, a
vast multitude who have not quite work enough to live on, ready to be
called on in any emergency of business, and used, to beat down, by their
competition, the wages of their fellow-workmen?&nbsp; Is this theory
altogether novel and unheard of?&nbsp; Or this theory also, that for
this very reason, Emigration, which looks the very simplest remedy for
most of this want,&mdash;while nine-tenths of the bounteous earth is
waiting to be subdued and replenished by the poor wretches who cannot
get at it&mdash;that Emigration, I say, is an unnecessary movement&mdash;that
the people are all wanted at home&mdash;to be such as the parson and
the mission women find them?</p>
<p>And it may be that the poor folk have heard&mdash;for a bird of the
air may carry the matter in these days of a free press&mdash;that some
rich folk, at least, hold this opinion, and translate it freely out
of the delicate language of political economy, into the more vigorous
dialect used in the fever alleys and smallpox courts in which the poor
are left to wait for work.&nbsp; But if there be any rich persons in
this congregation who hold these peculiar economic doctrines, let me
recommend to them, more than to any other persons present, that they
would support a society which alleviates the hard pressure of their
system; which helps to make it tolerable and prudent by teaching the
poor to save; by teaching them, in London alone,&mdash;how to save &pound;54,000
in the last eleven years.&nbsp; Let them help this society heartily.</p>
<p>The children of this world are&mdash;in their generation&mdash;wiser
than the children of light.&nbsp; But how long their generation will
last, depends mainly (we are told) on how far they make themselves friends
out of the mammon of unrighteousness.</p>
<p>But if, again, there be rich people in this congregation, as I trust
there are many and many, who start, indignant, at such an imputation,
and utterly deny its truth&mdash;then,&mdash;if it be false, why in
the name of God, and of humanity, and of common prudence, why do they
not go to these people and tell them so?&nbsp; Why do they not prove
that it is not so, by showing a little more human sympathy, not merely
for them behind their backs, but sympathy with them face to face?&nbsp;
If they wish to know how much can be done by only a little active kindness,
they have only to read the pages of that painful, and yet pleasant,
book&mdash;&ldquo;East and West,&rdquo;&mdash;which I have just quoted;
and to read, also, an appendix to it&mdash;a Paper originally read at
the Church Congress, Manchester, by the present Lord Chancellor&mdash;a
document which it would be an impertinence in me to recommend or praise.</p>
<p>Bring yourselves then boldly into contact with these classes, and
especially into contact with the women&mdash;with the wives and mothers.&nbsp;
For it is through the women, through them mainly, if not altogether,
that civilization and religion can be introduced among any degraded
class.&nbsp; It was so in the Middle Age.&nbsp; The legends which tell
us how woman was then the civilizer, the softener, the purifier, the
perpetual witness to fierce and coarse men, that there were nobler aims
in life than pleasure, and power, and the gratification of revenge;
that not self-assertion, but self-sacrifice was the Divine ideal, toward
which all must aspire.&nbsp; These old legends are immortal; for they
speak of facts and laws which will endure as long as there are women
upon earth.&nbsp; Through the woman, the civilizer and the Christianizer
must reach the man.&nbsp; Through the wife, he must reach the husband.&nbsp;
Through the mother, he must reach the children.&nbsp; I say he must.&nbsp;
It is easy to complain that the clergy in every age and country have
tried to obtain influence over women.&nbsp; They have been forced to
do so, because otherwise they could obtain no influence at all.&nbsp;
And if a priesthood should arise hereafter, whose calling was to teach
not religion but irreligion, not the good news that there is a good
God, and that we can know Him; but the bad news that there is no God,
or, if there is, we cannot know Him; then would that priesthood find
it necessary to appeal like all other priesthoods, to the women, and
to teach them how to teach their children.</p>
<p>But more.&nbsp; It is not religion only which must be taught through
the wives and mothers, but sound science also, and sound economy.&nbsp;
If you intend (as I trust some here intend) to teach the labouring classes
those laws of health and life, on which depend the comfort, the wholesomeness,
often the decency and the morality of the poor man&rsquo;s home, then
you must teach those laws first to the house-mother, who brings the
children into the world, and brings them up, who puts them to bed at
night, and prepares their food by day.&nbsp; If you wish to teach habits
of thrift, and sound notions of economy to the labouring classes, you
must teach them first to the housewife, who has to make the weekly earnings
cover, if possible, the week&rsquo;s expenses.&nbsp; If you wish to
soften and to purify the man, you must first soften and purify the woman,
or at least encourage her not to lose what womanliness she has left,
amid sights, and sounds, and habits which tend continually to destroy
her womanhood.&nbsp; You must encourage her, I say, to remember always
that she is a woman still, and let her teach&mdash;as none can teach
like her&mdash;true manfulness to her husband and her sons.</p>
<p>And how can you best do that?&nbsp; Not by giving her shillings,
not by preaching at her, not by scolding her: but by behaving to her
as what she is&mdash;a woman and a sister&mdash;and cheering her heavy
heart by simple human kindliness.&nbsp; What she wants amid all her
poverty and toil, her child-bearing and child-rearing, what she wants,
I say, to keep her brave and strong, is to know by actual sight and
speech that she is still not an outcast; not alone; that she is still
a member of the human family, that her fellow-woman has not forgotten
her; and that, therefore, it may be, He that was born of woman has not
forgotten her either.&nbsp; That she has, after all, a God in heaven,
who can be touched with the feeling of her infirmities, and can help
her and those she loves, to struggle through all their temptations,
seeing that He too was tempted in all things like them, yet without
sin.</p>
<p>It is only personal intercourse with them&mdash;only the meeting
of the rich and poor together, in the belief that God is the maker of
them all, that will do that.&nbsp; But it will do it.</p>
<p>Only personal intercourse will reconcile these people to their condition,
in as far as they <i>ought</i> to be reconciled to it.&nbsp; But personal
intercourse will reconcile them to it, as far as it ought, but no further.&nbsp;
And I think that the system of personal intercourse attempted by this
Society is, on the whole, the best yet devised.&nbsp; It is imperfect,
as all attempts to make that straight which is crooked, and to number
that which is wanting&mdash;to patch, in a word, a radically vicious
system of society,&mdash;must be imperfect; but it is the best plan
which I have yet seen.&nbsp; I find no fault with other plans, God forbid!&nbsp;
Wisdom is justified of all her children; and the amount of evil is so
great, and (as I believe, so dangerous), that I must bid God-speed to
any persons who will do anything, always saving and excepting indiscriminate
almsgiving.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that the soothing and civilizing, and in due time
Christianising, effect of personal intercourse cannot begin better than
through a woman, herself of the working class, who has struggled as
these poor souls have struggled, and conquered, more or less, where
they are failing.&nbsp; That through her they should be brought in contact
with women of the more comfortable and cultivated class, who are their
immediate employers, if not their immediate neighbours; and through
them, again, brought in contact with women of that class, of whom I
shall only say, that if they were not meant for some such noble work
as this&mdash;and not for mere pleasure and mere display, then for what
purpose, in heaven or earth, were they made? and why has Providence
taken the trouble (as it were) to elaborate, by long ages of civilization,
that most exquisite of all products of nature and of art&mdash;A Lady?</p>
<p>Ah! what the ladies of England might do, and that without interfering
in the least with their duties as wives and mothers, if they would work
together, as a class!&nbsp; If they would work as well and humanly while
they are in towns, as most of them do work while they are in the country;
as some of them do, to their honour, in the towns already!&nbsp; But
how many? what proportion do those who do good bear to those who do
nothing?&nbsp; What a small amount of humanizing and civilizing intercourse
with some women of the labouring class is there in the case of the wives
of rich men who come up to town, merely for the season, and forget that
it is their temporary and uncertain stay in London which causes much
of the temporary and uncertain employment of the London poor, and their
consequent temptation to unthrift and recklessness!&nbsp; How little
humanizing and civilizing intercourse with the poor is carried on by
the wives of those employers of labour who surely, surely owe something
more to their husband&rsquo;s work people, than to be aware (by hearsay)
that they are duly paid every Saturday night?</p>
<p>But I shall be told: We need not fear&mdash;we can justify ourselves
before God and man.&nbsp; I shall be reminded of all that has been done,
and done well too, for the poor during the last generation, and bidden
not to calumniate my countrymen.&nbsp; True, much has been done; and
done well.&nbsp; And true also it is that no effort to make the rich
and poor meet together, to bring the different classes of society into
contact with each other, but has succeeded&mdash;has sown good seed&mdash;which
I trust may bring forth good fruit in the day when every tree shall
be judged by its fruit.&nbsp; The events of 1830, startling and warning,
and those of 1848, more pregnant, if possible, with warning than the
former, awakened a spirit of humanity in England, which was also a spirit
of prudence and of common sense.</p>
<p>But I cannot conceal from myself, or you, that the earnestness which
was awakened in those days is dying out in these.&nbsp; The richer classes
of every country are tempted from time to time to fits of laziness&mdash;fits
of frivolity and luxury, surfeits, in which men say, with a shrug and
a yawn&mdash;&ldquo;Why be very much in earnest?&nbsp; Why take so much
trouble?&nbsp; Somebody must always be rich, why should not I?&nbsp;
Somebody must enjoy the money, why should not I?&nbsp; At all events,
things will last my time.&rdquo;&nbsp; And that such a surfeit has fallen
upon the rich of this land, is a fact; for that this is the tone of
to-day, and that the tone increases, none can deny who knows that which
calls itself the <i>world</i>, and calls itself so only too truly; the
world of which it is written, that all that is in the world&mdash;the
lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life&mdash;is
not of the Father, but of the world.&nbsp; And the world passeth away,
and the lust thereof.&nbsp; But he who doeth the will of God, he alone
abideth for ever.</p>
<p>God grant that we, who have just seen the most cunningly organized
and daintily bedizened specimen of a world, which ever flaunted on the
earth since men began to build their towers of Babel, collapse and crumble
at a single blow, may take God&rsquo;s hint, that the fashion of this
world passeth away.&nbsp; Let the idle, the frivolous, the sensual,
and those who, like Figaro&rsquo;s Marquis, have earned all earthly
happiness by only taking the trouble to be born&mdash;let them look
back on this last awful Christmas-tide, and hear, speaking in fact unmistakeable,
the voice of the Lord.&nbsp; Think ye that they whose blood Pilate mingled
with their sacrifices were sinners above all the Galil&aelig;ans, because
they suffered such things?&nbsp; I tell you, &ldquo;Nay: but except
ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are those who will hear such words with a smile, even with
a sneer, and say, Such wholesale judgments of God, even granting that
there are such things, are, after all, very rare: it is very seldom
that a whole class, a whole system of society, is punished in mass&mdash;and
why then need we trouble ourselves about so remote a probability?</p>
<p>Then know this&mdash;that as surely as God sometimes punishes wholesale,
so surely is He always punishing in detail.&nbsp; By that infinite concatenation
of moral causes and effects, which makes the whole world one mass of
special Providences, every sin of ours will punish itself, and probably
punish itself in kind.&nbsp; Are we selfish?&nbsp; We shall call out
selfishness in others.&nbsp; Do we neglect our duty?&nbsp; Then others
will neglect their duty to us.&nbsp; Do we indulge our passions?&nbsp;
Then others, who depend on us, will indulge theirs, to our detriment
and misery.&nbsp; Do we squander our money?&nbsp; Then our children
and our servants will squander our money for us.</p>
<p>Do we?&mdash;but what use to go on reminding men of truths which
no one believes, because they are too painful and searching to be believed
in comfort?&nbsp; What use to tell men what they never will confess
to be true&mdash;that by every crime, folly, even neglect of theirs,
they drive a thorn into their own flesh, which will trouble them for
years to come, it may be to their dying day?&nbsp; And yet so it is.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small;<br />Though
with patience He stands waiting, with exactness grinds He all.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>As those who neglect their fellow-creatures will discover, by the
most patent undeniable proofs, in that last great day, when the rich
and poor shall meet together, and then, at least, discover that the
Lord is the maker of them all.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
