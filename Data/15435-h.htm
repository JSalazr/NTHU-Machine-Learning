  <br clear="all" />
<hr class="short" />

  <p>This book has been prepared to help you in learning about "the house
  you live in," and to teach you to take care of it, and keep it from being
  destroyed by two of its greatest enemies,&mdash;Alcohol and Nicotine.</p>

  <p>As you study its pages, be sure to find out the meaning of every word
  in them which you do not understand; for, if you let your tongue say what
  your mind knows nothing about, you are talking <i>parrot-fashion</i>.</p>

  <p>And do not forget that you must pay for all the knowledge you obtain,
  whether you are rich or poor. Nobody else can pay for you. You, your own
  self, must <i>pay attention</i> with your own mind, through your own eyes
  and ears, <i>or do without knowledge</i>.</p>

  <p>Be wise: gain all the knowledge you can concerning everything worth
  knowing, and use it for the good of yourself and other people.</p>

  <p>1. My body is built of bones covered with flesh and skin; the blood
  flows through it, all the time, from my heart. I breathe through my nose
  and mouth, and take the air into my lungs.</p>

  <p>2. The parts of my body are the head, the trunk, the limbs.</p>

<p class="center">THE NOSE AND THE MOUTH.</p>

  <p>Be sure to keep your mouth closed when you are not talking or singing,
  especially when you are walking, running, or <i>asleep</i>. The two
  nostrils are outside doors, always open to admit the air, and inside of
  the upper part of the nose there are two other openings, through which it
  passes into the throat. Air which goes this way is warmed, cleansed, and
  moistened, but that which is breathed directly through the mouth is not
  so well prepared for its work in the lungs.</p>

  <p>Do not use your mouth as a box or a pin-cushion; the pin, or whatever
  yon have put into it, may slip into your throat and cause your death.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Some joints, as those of the skull, are immovable; some, as those of
  the spine, may be moved a little; and others more or less freely, as
  those of the limbs. In machines, the parts which move upon each other
  need to be oiled, to keep them from wearing out; but the joints of our
  bodies oil themselves with a thin fluid, called <i>synovia</i>. This
  fluid resembles the white of an egg, and comes from a smooth lining
  inside of the joints. The ends of the bones which form joints are covered
  by gristle or <i>cartilage</i>, and are fastened together by very strong,
  silvery white bands, called <i>ligaments</i>. A sprain is caused by
  overstretching or tearing some of these ligaments.</p>

<p class="center">I.</p>

  <p>1. Close both hands.</p>

  <p>2. Raise the forefinger of the right hand, as the index or pointing
  finger.</p>

  <p>3. Place the index finger upon the lower thumb joint of the left
  hand.</p>

  <p>4. Draw the index finger down to the wrist, over the bone between the
  thumb knuckle and the wrist, and count "One."</p>

  <p>5. Place the index finger on the knuckle of the first finger.</p>

  <p>6. Draw the index finger down to the wrist, over the bone leading from
  the first finger to the wrist, and count "Two."</p>

  <p>7. So on, for each of the three other bones of the hand. Repeat until
  no mistake is made in touching or counting.</p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

  <p>1. Raise the thumb, and place the index finger of the right hand on
  the middle of the upper part of the thumb for bone "Six"; then</p>

  <p>2. On the lower part of the thumb for bone "Seven." Repeat from the
  beginning, until the children can touch and count each bone properly.</p>

<p class="center">III.</p>

  <p>1. Keep the thumb erect; raise the first finger of the left hand.</p>

  <p>2. Place the index finger on the bone between the tip and the first
  joint of the first finger for bone "Eight."</p>

  <p>3. Between the first and middle joint for bone "Nine."</p>

  <p>4. Between the middle and third joint for bone "Ten." Review, from the
  beginning, until the class can touch and count every bone as
  directed.</p>

<p class="center">IV.</p>

  <p>1. Keep the thumb and forefinger erect; raise the second finger and
  touch, as in the lesson on the first finger bones, "Eleven," "Twelve,"
  and "Thirteen." Review. <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19" id="page19"></a>[19]</span></p>

  <p>2. Proceed in the same manner for the third and fourth fingers, always
  beginning with the bone nearest the tip of the finger, and touching that
  at the lowest part last.</p>

  <p>If the exercise has been properly performed, every child will say
  "Nineteen" as its index finger touches the lowest bone of the little
  finger, and all the fingers of every left hand will be outspread.</p>

  <p>We teach the children to say "about two hundred," because there is not
  always the same number of bones in the body. In some parts two or three
  bones unite and form one bone. For example: the breastbone of a child is
  made up of eight pieces; some of these unite as it becomes older, so that
  when fully grown it has but three pieces in this bone.</p>

<h3>PART IV.</h3>

<p class="center">FORMULAS FOR THE LESSONS ON THE ORGANS OF SENSE.</p>

  <p>1. <i>The Eyes.</i>&mdash;My eyes are to see with.</p>

  <p>My eye is like a ball in a deep, bony socket. The black circle in the
  centre is the pupil or window of my eye; the colored ring is the iris or
  curtain; the white part is the eyeball.</p>

  <p>My upper and lower eyelids cover and protect my eyes.</p>

  <p>My eyebrows are for beauty, and keep the perspiration from rolling
  into my eyes.</p>

  <p>My eyes are washed by teardrops every time I wink my eyelids.</p>

  <p>2. <i>The Ears.</i>&mdash;My ears are to hear with:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>the rim of my ear,</p>
      <p>the flap of my ear,</p>
      <p>the drum of my ear.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The drum of my ear is protected by a fence of short, stiff hairs, and
  by a bitter wax about the roots of these hairs.</p>

  <p>3. <i>The Nose.</i>&mdash;My nose is to smell and breathe with; it is
  in the middle of my face:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>my two nostrils,</p>
      <p>the bridge of my nose,</p>
      <p>the cartilage,</p>
      <p>the tip of my nose.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>My nostrils lead to a passage back of my mouth through which I
  breathe.</p>

  <p>The cartilage separates my nose into two parts.</p>

  <p>4. <i>The Mouth.</i>&mdash;My mouth is to speak, eat, and breathe
  through:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>my upper lip,</p>
      <p>my lower lip.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[21]</span></p>

  <p>In my mouth are:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>my tongue,</p>
      <p>my lower teeth,</p>
      <p>my upper teeth,</p>
      <p>my lower teeth,</p>
      <p>and my upper and lower jaws, covered with flesh called <i>gum</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>5. <i>The Teeth.</i>&mdash;My teeth are used in eating and
  talking.</p>

  <p>My teeth are made of a soft kind of bone, covered with enamel.</p>

  <p>I have three kinds of teeth: cutting teeth, tearing teeth, grinding
  teeth.</p>

  <p>A young child has twenty teeth, ten in each jaw.</p>

  <p>A grown person has thirty-two teeth, sixteen in each jaw.</p>

  <p>6. To preserve my teeth:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I must keep them clean.</p>
      <p>I must not scratch the enamel.</p>
      <p>I must not eat or drink anything very hot or very cold.</p>
      <p>I must not use them for scissors or nut-crackers.</p>
      <p>I must not burn them with tobacco or cigars.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>7. <i>About Eating.</i>&mdash;When I eat I move my lower jaw only.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>My tongue brings the food between my teeth,</p>
      <p>the cutters cut it,</p>
      <p>the tearers tear it,</p>
      <p>the grinders grind it,</p>
      <p>the saliva moistens it,</p>

<h3>PART V.</h3>

<p class="center">FORMULA FOR DESCRIPTION OF THE BONES.</p>

  <p>1. My skull is formed of several bones united, like two saws with
  their toothed edges hooked into each other.</p>

  <p>2. My spine extends from the base of the skull behind, down the middle
  of my back.</p>

  <p>It is composed of twenty-four short bones, piled one upon the other,
  with cartilage between them.</p>

  <p>These bones are fastened together, forming an upright and flexible
  column, which makes me erect and graceful.</p>

  <p>3. My ribs are curved, strong, and light; there are twenty-four of
  them, twelve on each side; they are fastened at the back to my spine, in
  front to my breastbone, forming a hollow place for my heart, lungs, and
  stomach.</p>

  <p>4. My shoulder blades are flat, thin, and like a triangle in shape;
  they are for my arms to rest upon.</p>

  <p>5. My collar bones are fastened to my shoulder blades and my
  breastbone; they keep my arms from sliding too far forward.</p>

  <p>6. The bones of old people are hard and brittle; those of children
  soft and flexible; so I must sit and stand erect, that mine may not be
  bent out of shape. I must not wear tight clothing, or do anything that
  will crowd them out of their places.</p>

  <p>7. My bones are made from my food, after it has been changed into
  blood; so I must be careful to eat good, wholesome food, that they may be
  strong and healthy.</p>

<p><!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[27]</span></p>

  <p>8. I must not breathe impure air, because impure air makes bad blood,
  and bad blood makes poor bones.</p>

  <p>9. The body of every person is changing all the time, because the
  skin, flesh, and bones are always wearing out, and the blood is always
  repairing and building them again.</p>

  <p>A little girl was looking at some pictures of ladies in fashionable
  dresses. While admiring the beautiful styles and bright colors of the
  garments, she pointed to the waist of one, and exclaimed, "<i>That means
  trouble</i>." The waist was too small for a grown person, and could only
  have been made so by <i>tight-lacing</i>. The child had been taught that
  dresses, corsets, coats, vests, bands, or anything fastened tightly
  around the waist, press upon the ribs and crowd them out of place,
  preventing the heart, lungs, and other inside organs from working as they
  should, causing headache, dyspepsia, shortness of breath, and often
  ending in some incurable disease, so she knew that <i>tight clothing
  means trouble</i> to the wearer.</p>

  <p>1. Muscles are the red, elastic bands and bundles of thread like
  substance, called flesh, which cover the bones and make the eyeballs, the
  eyelids, the tongue, the heart, the lungs, and various other parts of the
  body.</p>

  <p>2. There are about four hundred and fifty muscles in my body.</p>

  <p>3. The work of the muscles is to support and move my bones, and
  different parts of the body.</p>

  <p>4. The muscles may be named the muscles of my head, the muscles of my
  trunk, the muscles of my limbs.</p>

  <p>5. The muscles of my head cover and move the parts of my head and
  face. The muscles of my trunk cover and move the parts of my neck and
  trunk. The muscles of my limbs cover and mote the parts of my arms and
  legs.</p>

<p class="center">CLASSES AND WORK OF THE MUSCLES.</p>

  <p>The muscles are divided into two great classes: those which we may
  move as we choose, called <i>voluntary</i> muscles, and those over which
  we have no power, called <i>involuntary</i> muscles.</p>

  <p>Some muscles support and move the various parts of the body, others
  have different work to do. The heart, the great involuntary muscle, acts
  like an engine to drive the blood throughout the body; the lungs draw in
  and throw out the air in breathing; the stomach helps to churn and change
  food into blood; the tongue is used in speaking and eating.</p>

  <br clear="all" />
<hr class="short" />

<p class="center">QUESTIONS ON THE MUSCLES.</p>

  <p>What are the muscles?&mdash;"The lean flesh of the body; bands and
  bundles of fleshy threads which cover the body."</p>

  <p>Of what use are the muscles to the body?&mdash;"They cover the bones;
  they support and move the bones and different parts of the body."</p>

  <p>Name some parts of the body which are made of muscles.&mdash;"The
  eyeballs, the eyelids, the tongue, the heart, the lungs."</p>

  <p>What color are the muscles?&mdash;"Red."</p>

  <p>How do the muscles move the bones?&mdash;"By shortening or lengthening
  themselves according to the way the bones are to be moved."</p>

  <p>Tell how the muscles move your arm at the elbow.&mdash;"The <!-- Page
  35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[35]</span>
  muscles in the front part of the arm shorten themselves, to draw my
  fore-arm toward the shoulder; when I wish to stretch out the fore-arm
  these muscles lengthen, while another set of muscles shorten, to draw the
  fore-arm away from the upper arm."</p>

  <p>What do you say about the muscles because they have the power to
  shorten and lengthen themselves?&mdash;"They are elastic."</p>

  <p>About how many muscles are there in your whole body?&mdash;"About four
  hundred and fifty."</p>

  <p>How may these be divided as you study about them?&mdash;"They may be
  divided into the muscles of my head, the muscles of my trunk, and the
  muscles of my limbs."</p>

  <p>Of what use are the muscles of your head?&mdash;"They cover and move
  the parts of my head and face."</p>

  <p>Of what use are the muscles of your trunk?&mdash;"They move the parts
  of my neck and trunk."</p>

  <p>Of what use are the muscles of your limbs?&mdash;"They move the parts
  of my arms and legs."</p>

  <p>How can you make your muscles strong?&mdash;"By using them."</p>

  <p>How can you make your muscles weak?&mdash;"By not using them."</p>

  <p>What is necessary to make your muscles strong and healthy?&mdash;"They
  must be used; they must be rested when tired; they must be supplied with
  pure blood."</p>

  <p>How should the muscles be used?&mdash;"They should be exercised in
  work or play."</p>

  <p>How may they be rested?&mdash;"I may rest my muscles by changing
  position; by changing my kind of work or play; or by going to sleep."</p>

  <p>Explain what you mean by changing your position.&mdash;"If I am
  standing, I must sit or lie down to rest them; if they are tired, because
  I have been sitting too long, I must rest them by standing, walking, or
  running."</p>

  <p>What do you mean by changing the kind of work or play?&mdash;"If, in
  my work or play, my arms become tired, I must do something in which my
  arms may rest, though other parts of my body may be in exercise."</p>

<p><!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[36]</span></p>

  <p>How may you help supply your muscles with good blood?&mdash;"By
  breathing pure air; by taking wholesome food and drink; and by living in
  the sunlight."</p>

  <p>How does drinking alcoholic liquors hurt the muscles?&mdash;"It makes
  them weak, and unfit to move the parts of the body."</p>

  <p>What wonderful muscle moves without your will?&mdash;"The heart."</p>

  <p>3. I have two skins; the inner skin is the true skin.</p>

  <p>4. My true skin is elastic, and like a net-work of blood-vessels and
  nerves. My true skin is covered with a jelly-like substance which gives
  color to my skin.</p>

  <p>5. My outside skin is not the same thickness over my whole body. In
  some parts, as on the palms of my hands and the soles of my feet, it is
  very thick and tough.</p>

  <p>6. If my outside skin be destroyed, it will grow again; if the
  jelly-like substance be destroyed, it will re-appear; but if my true skin
  be destroyed, it will never be perfectly renewed.</p>

  <p>Of what use is the skin?&mdash;"It covers the muscles of the
  body."</p>

  <p>What can you tell about it?&mdash;"It is flexible, elastic, porous,
  and absorbent."</p>

  <p>Why do you say it is flexible?&mdash;"Because it is easily bent."</p>

  <p>Why do you say it is porous?&mdash;"Because it is full of little
  holes, or pores."</p>

  <p>Why do you say it is elastic?&mdash;"Because it will spring back after
  it is stretched, squeezed, twisted, or bent."</p>

  <p>Why do you say it is absorbent?&mdash;"Because it will soak up
  liquids."</p>

  <p>How many skins have you?&mdash;"Two; an outside skin, and an inner
  skin."</p>

  <p>Which is the true skin?&mdash;"The inner skin."</p>

  <p>Of what is the inner skin composed?&mdash;"Of blood-vessels and
  nerves."</p>

  <p>How do you know that the outer skin has no
  blood-vessels?&mdash;"Because if I put a pin through the outer skin the
  blood does not flow out, as it would if I had cut a blood-vessel."</p>

  <p>How do you know the outer skin has no nerves?&mdash;"Because <!-- Page
  41 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[41]</span>
  if I put a pin through my outer skin it does not make me suffer pain, as
  it would if I had touched a nerve."</p>

  <p>What gives color to the skin?&mdash;"A jelly-like substance between
  the inner and the outer skin."</p>

  <p>What have you learned about the true skin?&mdash;"That it is of the
  same color in people of every nation."</p>

  <p>What difference is there in the thickness of the outer skin? [See
  Formula.]</p>

  <p>What passes through the pores of the skin? [See Formula.]</p>

  <p>What is this waste called when it comes from the surface of the
  skin?&mdash;"Perspiration."</p>

  <p>When does the perspiration flow through the pores of the
  skin?&mdash;"All the time, if the skin is healthy."</p>

  <p>Why do we not always see the perspiration which passes through the
  pores?&mdash;"Because it does not always form drops on the surface of the
  skin; it generally passes off in very fine particles."</p>

  <p>What becomes of the fine or minute portions of perspiration which pass
  from the body?&mdash;"Some of these portions are absorbed by the
  clothing; some pass into and mix with the air around us."</p>

  <p>What effect does the perspiration produce on the air and the
  clothing?&mdash;"It soon makes the air unfit to be breathed, and the
  clothing unfit to be worn."</p>

  <p>What is necessary if you would have a healthy skin? [See Formula.]</p>

  <p>Why must you wear clean clothing?&mdash;"That there may be nothing
  impure in the clothing for the pores of the skin to absorb."</p>

  <p>Why should you breathe pure air?&mdash;"Because air purifies the
  blood, and pure blood is necessary to make a healthy skin."</p>

  <p>How does drinking alcoholic liquors hurt the skin?&mdash;"It makes the
  blood impure, and impure blood makes unhealthy skin."</p>

  <p>In what other way does drinking these liquors hurt the skin?&mdash;"It
  gives the skin too much work to do."</p>

<p><!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[42]</span></p>

  <p>How does it give it too much work to do?&mdash;"It makes more waste

<h3>PART VIII.</h3>

<p class="center">FORMULA FOR THE LESSON ON THE HEART AND THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.</p>

  <p>1. My heart is shaped like a cone, and placed in my chest near my
  breastbone, with its apex pointing downward to my left side. It beats
  about seventy times a minute, sending out about two ounces of blood at
  every beat.</p>

  <p>2. The blood when pure is of a bright red color; it is a liquid made
  from food and drink.</p>

  <p>3. It passes from my heart to all parts of my body, through pipes
  called arteries; these arteries spread out through the body like branches
  from a tree.</p>

  <p>4. As the blood flows from the heart, through the arteries, it gives
  nourishment to every part of the body, and carries away the impurities it
  meets, which makes it black and thick; when it comes through the veins,
  back to the heart, it is not fit to be used, so it goes to the lungs to
  be purified by the fresh air; then it returns to the heart to be sent
  again throughout the body; this happens once in from three to eight
  minutes, and is called the circulation of the blood.</p>

  drawn together and held in place by narrow strips of adhesive plaster,
  fastened across the wound from side to side.</p>

  <p>If the cut is very deep, and the blood flows very freely, send for a
  doctor. While you wait for him, knot a handkerchief, or suspender, or
  towel, in the middle, and twist it very tightly <i>over the cut artery,

  handkerchief <i>below the wound</i>. If the blood continues to flow, tie
  a bandage both above and below the hurt part.</p>

  <p>3. I breathe by drawing the air through my windpipe, along the tubes

  pressed out through the same tubes, windpipe, nose, and mouth, into the

  <p>The air which enters through the nose and mouth passes into a tube of
  muscles and ring-like pieces of cartilage. The upper part of this tube is
  the voice-box or <i>larynx</i>, covered by a spoon-shaped lid which
  closes when we swallow; the lower part is the <i>trachea</i>, and the two
  parts are the windpipe. The trachea divides into two branches, <i>the
  bronchial tubes</i>, one for each lung. These tubes divide again and
  again like the branches of a tree, and end in exceedingly small sacs or
  bags. The air in these sacs, or air-cells, gives <i>oxygen</i> to the
  blood in the tiny blood-vessels of the lungs and takes from them the
  poison, <i>carbonic-acid gas</i>, water, and impurities, which it carries
  back through the windpipe into the outside air.</p>

  <p>Of what use is the air when it is in the lungs?&mdash;"It makes the
  blood pure."</p>

  <p>Why can you not live without breathing?&mdash;"Because, if I do not
  breathe, pure air cannot get into the lungs to make the bad blood pure,
  and I cannot live if the dark, impure blood is sent back again through my
  body."</p>

  <p>Why must you live in the sunlight?&mdash;"Because the sunlight helps
  to purify the blood and strengthen the body."</p>

  <p>Why must you wear loose clothing?&mdash;"Because tight clothing stops
  the circulation of the blood."</p>

  <p>Why must you avoid tight-lacing?&mdash;"Because tight-lacing crowds
  the ribs against the lungs, so that the lungs cannot move freely."</p>

  <p>Why should you wear clean clothing?&mdash;"That nothing impure may
  pass into the body through the pores of the skin."</p>

  <p>Why should you keep the body clean?&mdash;"That the pores of the skin
  may not be closed, but remain open to let the perspiration pass
  through."</p>

  <p>What has the cleanliness of the body to do with the health of the
  lungs?&mdash;"If the body is not kept clean, the perspiratory pores
  become clogged."</p>

  <p>What happens when the perspiratory pores are clogged?&mdash;"The
  impure particles which should pass through them stay in the body, and
  cause disease in the lungs or other parts."</p>

  <p>Why should you sit and stand erect?&mdash;"Because, if I am in the
  habit of stooping, my lungs will be crowded, and will not have enough
  room to move freely."</p>

  <p>Why should you keep all parts of the body warm?&mdash;"Because <!--
  Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
  id="page54"></a>[54]</span> chilling any part of the body causes the
  blood to chill in that part, and thus hinders its circulation."</p>

  <p>Why should you not change your winter clothing too early in the spring
  of the year?&mdash;"I may take cold if not warmly clothed during the cool
  days of early spring."</p>

  <p>Why should you avoid draughts of cool air?&mdash;"Because the cool air
  blows upon some parts of the body and closes the pores of the skin,
  checking the perspiration, and hindering the circulation of the
  blood."</p>

  <p>Why should you not rush suddenly from a warm to a cool
  place?&mdash;"Because when warm the pores of the skin are open; if I rush
  suddenly into the cool air, these pores are closed too quickly."</p>

  <p>Why does stopping the perspiration hurt the lungs more or
  less?&mdash;"The impurities it ought to carry away remain in the body,
  make the blood impure, and produce disease in some part; very often that
  part is the lungs."</p>

  <p>What harm does alcohol do in the lungs?&mdash;"It fills the lungs with
  impure blood."</p>

  <p>What harm does it do to the air-cells?&mdash;"It hardens the walls of
  the air-cells of the lungs."</p>

  <p>What harm is done by the hardening of these air-cells?&mdash;"1. The
  lungs cannot take in enough of the gas called oxygen to purify the blood
  perfectly. 2. The gases or vapors in the lungs cannot pass freely through
  the hardened air-cells."</p>

  <p>What happens from this?&mdash;"The lungs become diseased."</p>

<p class="center">FORMULA FOR THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS AND DIGESTION.</p>

  <p>1. When my food is chewed, it is rolled by my tongue into the
  oesophagus, or food-pipe, which is back of my windpipe, and leads from my
  mouth down along the side of my spine, to the left and upper end of my
  stomach.</p>

  <p>2. My stomach is an oblong, soft, and fleshy bag, extending from my
  left to my right side, below my lungs and heart.</p>

  <p>3. It is composed of three coats or membranes, and resembles
  tripe.</p>

  <p>4. The <i>outer coat</i> is smooth, thick, and tough. It supports and
  strengthens the stomach.</p>

  <p>5. The <i>middle coat</i> is fibrous. Its fibres have the power of
  contracting, sometimes pressing upon the food, and sometimes pushing it
  along toward the opening which leads out of the stomach.</p>

  <p>6. The <i>inner coat</i> is soft, thick, spongy, and wrinkled. It
  prepares a slimy substance and a fluid. The slimy substance prevents the
  stomach from being irritated by the food. The fluid dissolves the
  food.</p>

  <p>7. Food passes through several changes after it enters the mouth.</p>

  <p>8. It is changed into pulp in the <i>mouth</i>, by the action of the
  teeth and the saliva. This is called <i>mastication</i>. It is changed in
  the <i>stomach</i>, by the action of the stomach and the gastric juice,
  into another kind of pulp called <i>chyme</i>. The chyme is changed by
  the bile and another kind of juice, called <i>pancreatic</i> <!-- Page 58
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[58]</span>
  <i>juice</i>; these separate the nourishing from the waste substance. The
  nourishing, milk-like substance is called <i>chyle</i>. The waste
  substance passes from the body. The chyle is poured into a vein behind
  the collar bone, and passes through the heart to the lungs, where it is
  changed into blood.</p>

<p class="center">"EAT TO LIVE, NOT LIVE TO EAT."</p>

  <p>There is pleasure in eating, because God has given us the sense of
  taste, that we may enjoy our food. But not everything which pleases this
  sense is good for the body, so we should learn what things are wholesome
  and choose them for our food and drink, refusing everything which is
  unwholesome. Those who obey these rules "<i>eat to live</i>" and never
  become drunkards or gluttons.</p>

  <p>How has this been proved?&mdash;"Alcohol has been found in the brain,
  and other parts of drunkards, with the same smell and the same power to
  burn easily which it had when it was taken into the mouth."</p>

  <p>How do you know it is a poison?&mdash;"Because it does harm to every
  part of the body, beginning in the stomach."</p>

  <p>What harm does alcohol do in the stomach?&mdash;"It hinders the
  stomach from doing its work; it burns the coats of the stomach; it
  destroys the gastric juice; it hardens the food, so that it cannot be
  dissolved by the gastric juice."</p>

  <p>What does the stomach do with alcohol?&mdash;"Drives it out as soon as
  possible."</p>

  <p>Where does the stomach send it?&mdash;"Into the liver."</p>

  it to the lungs."</p>

  <p>What do the lungs do with the alcohol?&mdash;"They drive it out as
  soon as they can."</p>

<p><!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[63]</span></p>

  <p>Where do the lungs send some of it?&mdash;"Through the nose and mouth,

<h3>PART XI.</h3>

<p class="center">FORMULA FOR THE LESSON ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</p>

  <p>1. My brain is a soft gray-and-white mass resembling marrow.</p>

  <p>2. It is placed in a bony box called the skull; it is covered and held
  together by three coats or membranes.</p>

  <p>3. The outer membrane is thick and firm; it strengthens and supports
  the brain.</p>

  <p>4. The middle membrane is thick, and somewhat like a spider's web in
  appearance.</p>

  <p>5. The inner membrane is a network of blood-vessels.</p>

  <p>6. From the brain, white or reddish gray pulpy cords, called nerves,
  pass to all parts of the body. These nerves are of two kinds: nerves of
  feeling, and nerves of motion.</p>

  <p>7. If I prick my finger, a nerve of feeling carries the message to my
  brain; if I wish to move my finger, a nerve of motion causes my finger to
  obey my will.</p>

  <p>8. Twelve pairs of nerves pass from the base of the brain: the first
  pair, called the nerves of smell, to my nose; the fourth pair, called the
  nerves of sight, to my eyes; the fifth pair, called the nerves of taste,
  to my mouth, tongue, and teeth. One pair pass to my face; another to my
  ears. The ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth pairs to my tongue and
  parts of my throat and neck.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[66]</span></p>

  <p>9. The spinal cord is a bundle of nerves extending from the base of my
  brain, down through the whole length of my spine, or backbone. It is the
  largest nerve in my body.</p>

  <p>10. From the spine, thirty-one pairs of nerves, called <i>spinal
  nerves</i>, pass to different parts of my body; some to the lungs, some
  to the heart, some to the stomach, some to the bones, and some to the
  muscles and skin.</p>

  <p>11. If a nerve be destroyed it cannot carry messages to and from the
  brain. Before filling a tooth, the dentist sometimes destroys its
  nerve.</p>

  <p>12. If a nerve be pressed upon too long it cannot perform its duty. If
  I press upon the nerve passing to my foot, I stop it from communicating
  with the brain; the foot loses its feeling, or, as I say, "is
  asleep."</p>

  <p>13. If I drink alcoholic liquors, or snuff, smoke, or chew tobacco, my
  brain and nerves cannot do their work well; because alcohol and nicotine
  are very poisonous to the brain and nerves.</p>

  <p>14. The brain must be supplied with good blood;</p>

  <p>The brain must be used;</p>

  <p>The brain must be rested;</p>

  <p>I must drink wholesome drink, eat wholesome food, take enough
  exercise, and breathe pure air, that my brain may be supplied with pure
  blood;</p>

  <p>I must study and think, that my brain may grow and be strong for
  work;</p>

<p><!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p class="center">THE BRAIN AND ITS WORK.</p>

  <p>The brain is egg-shaped, and of two parts, the large brain
  (<i>cerebrum</i>), and the little brain (<i>cerebellum</i>). These are
  composed of a white and gray substance, which in the large brain is so
  folded and wrinkled that it looks like the meat of an English walnut; in
  the little brain it is so arranged that it resembles a tree, and is
  called <i>arbor vit</i>, tree of life. The mind does its thinking
  through the large brain, and controls its muscles through the little
  brain.</p>

  <p>A drunken man can not walk straight because alcohol has hurt the
  little brain; he can not think straight because it has poisoned the large
  brain.</p>

<h3>ALCOHOL.</h3>

<p class="center">THE STORY ABOUT ALCOHOL.</p>

  <p>Several hundred years ago many people were trying to discover
  something that would keep them young and strong, and prevent them from
  dying. It is said by some that a man named Paracelsus, in making
  experiments, discovered <i>alcohol</i>. He called it "the water of life,"
  and boasted that he would never be weak and never die; so he went on
  drinking alcoholic liquors until at last he died in a drunken fit.</p>

  <p>What is this alcohol which has done and is doing so much mischief in
  the world? I will show you some. What does it look like?&mdash;"Water."
  Yes; and if you were to smell it you would say it has a somewhat pleasant
  odor; if you were to taste it, that it has a hot, biting taste,
  <i>i.e.</i>, is pungent. If you put a lighted match to it you would
  notice that it burns easily, and with a flame, and may therefore be said
  to be combustible and inflammable.</p>

  <p>What does it come from? Is it one of the drinks God has given us? Some
  of the class think it is; we will try to learn whether this answer is
  correct or not. If we study about it very carefully we shall discover
  that it is not a natural drink, that it is not found except where it has
  been made from decayed or rotten fruits, grains, or vegetables.</p>

  <p>If you take some apples, and squeeze the juice out of them, you will
  find it sweet and pleasant; let that juice stand for several days and
  what will happen to it?&mdash;"It will get bad." Yes; or, as grown people
  say, it will <i>work</i> or <i>ferment</i>; that is, the sugary part of
  the juice will be separated into a kind of gas and a liquid. The gas is
  called <i>carbonic acid gas</i>; the liquid is <i>alcohol</i>. Both the
  gas and the liquid are poisonous.</p>

  <p>Alcohol may also be obtained from other fruits, as grapes, and from
  some grains and vegetables. But all these must first become rotten before
  alcohol will come out of them. This is <!-- Page 74 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[74]</span> one reason
  why we think that God, who gives us good, wholesome food, did not intend
  alcohol to be a drink for man, else He would have put it into the
  delicious ripe fruit, and not made it impossible to get until they
  decay.</p>

  <p>Now let us put upon the blackboard something which will help us
  remember what we have learned about</p>

<p class="center">USES OF ALCOHOL.</p>

  <p>We put some sugar into water; the children see that it melts; then
  some glue or shellac is placed in the same liquid; they see that this is
  not melted, but that, when alcohol is used instead of water, the glue or
  shellac is dissolved. From this experiment they learn that alcohol is
  used in making varnishes.</p>

  <p>Some water is poured into one saucer, and alcohol into another; a
  lighted match is applied to each; the class notices that the alcohol
  takes fire and burns, while the water does not.</p>

  <p>Next, we fill a lamp with alcohol, and put a wick into it; when the
  wick becomes wet with the fluid it burns steadily and without smoke, as
  may be seen by holding a clean white saucer over the flame. This shows
  why jewellers and others, who wish to use a lamp to make things very hot,
  prefer alcohol to kerosene, which, as the children know, smokes
  lamp-chimneys, or anything else, so easily.</p>

  <p>We show a thermometer; the children are told its use if they are not
  already familiar with the instrument; we talk about the quicksilver in
  the tube, about its rising or falling according to the degree of heat or
  cold; then we inform the class that in <!-- Page 75 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[75]</span> some
  countries where it is very cold quicksilver freezes; for this reason
  alcohol, which does not freeze, is colored red and put into the
  thermometer tube to be used in these Arctic regions.</p>

  <p>Another use for alcohol is to keep or preserve substances. This we
  illustrate by placing a piece of meat into some alcohol. We explain that
  the water in the meat is that which causes it to decay. Alcohol has the
  power to take up or <i>absorb</i> water; so when meat is put into this
  liquid the water from the meat is absorbed by it, and the meat does not
  become bad. Those who wish to preserve insects a long time, and doctors
  who desire to keep any portion of a human body after death, put these
  into alcohol, in which they may be kept for a long time.</p>

  <p>Lastly, we let the children smell cologne or other perfumery, and tell
  them this is made from different oils mixed with alcohol.</p>

  <p>At the close of this lesson the class is ready to help us make the
  following BLACKBOARD OUTLINE.</p>

<p class="center">USES OF ALCOHOL&mdash;<i>concluded</i>.</p>

  <p>You see alcohol is very useful for some purposes; but do people ever
  drink it? Some of the children think not, and we grant that no one is
  foolish enough to drink <i>raw</i> alcohol, because it is too strong. It
  would take only a little to make them drunk, and only a few ounces to
  kill them instantly.</p>

  <p>We ask the pupils if they have ever seen a drunken person, and what
  made that person drunk? We soon obtain an answer, <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[76]</span> and place
  upon the board "Rum, gin, whiskey, brandy," as the names of drinks which
  will take away the good sense of those who drink them. To these are added
  "Wine, beer, ale, lager, and cider."</p>

  <p>We explain that all these have alcohol in them, as may be known by
  smelling them, or by smelling the breath of those who have drunk even a
  little of them; and that because they contain alcohol they are called
  <i>alcoholic liquors</i>. If a person drinks any one of them he will be
  poisoned, more or less, according to how much he takes. The children are
  astonished at the word <i>poisoned</i>, but we explain that the very
  word, <i>intoxicated</i>, means poisoned. So a drunken man is a poisoned
  man. If enough alcohol, or alcoholic liquor, is drunk by anyone, he will
  drop down dead as quickly as if he were shot by a cannon ball.</p>

  <p>When told that alcohol is not a food, but a poison, the class readily
  understands what we mean, and we have no difficulty in having the
  following statements prepared and memorized:</p>

<p class="center">ABOUT FERMENTATION AND FERMENTED LIQUOR.</p>

  <p><b><i>Alcohol.</i></b>&mdash;Alcohol may be obtained from any
  substance which contains sugar or starch, or both sugar and starch, as
  apples, pears, grapes, potatoes, beets, rice, barley, maple, honey,
  etc.</p>

  <p>Alcohol can be obtained only by <i>fermentation</i>. By fermentation
  we mean the change which takes place when a juice containing sugar
  decays, or goes to pieces. You know decay always makes things fall to
  pieces.</p>

  <p>You ask, what pieces is sugar made of? Very, very little pieces,
  called <i>atoms</i>. There are different kinds of sugar. In that made
  from grapes, called <i>grape sugar</i>, there are six atoms of carbon,
  twelve of hydrogen, and six of oxygen. What are carbon, hydrogen, and
  oxygen? Oxygen is the kind of gas which keeps animals alive, and makes
  things burn. Hydrogen is another kind, which you have smelled perhaps
  when water has been spilled on a hot stove; the gas burned in
  street-lamps is hydrogen that has been driven out of coal. Carbon you see
  in charcoal and soot; the black lead of your lead-pencils is mostly
  composed of carbon and iron; lamp-black is pure carbon, without form or
  shape.</p>

  <p>We will let these circles of colored paper stand for the atoms of
  carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in grape sugar,&mdash;the largest, which are
  red, for the oxygen; the second size, which you notice are black, will
  represent atoms of carbon; while the little blue ones will make you think
  of hydrogen.</p>

  <p>If you remember that it takes one atom of carbon and two of oxygen to
  make carbonic acid gas; also, that two atoms of carbon, one of oxygen,
  and six of hydrogen to form alcohol, you can easily find that two atoms
  of carbonic acid gas and two atoms of alcohol may be formed from an atom
  of sugar. So the more sugar a juice contains the more alcohol may be
  formed from it.</p>

<p><!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[78]</span></p>

  <p><b><i>Cider.</i></b>&mdash;Cider is made by pressing the juice out of
  apples. This sweet cider ferments, and the sugar part of it changes into
  carbonic acid gas and alcohol. People who do not understand this go on
  drinking cider, not knowing that it makes drunkards of those who drink
  much of a beverage which seems so pleasant and harmless.</p>

  <p><b><i>Wines.</i></b>&mdash;Wines are made from the juices of fruits
  which have sugar in them, especially grapes. Sometimes people have what
  they call <i>home-made wines</i>, which they make from blackberries,
  currants, elderberries, gooseberries, cherries, or other fruits. They may
  ask you to take some, saying, "This will do you no harm; we did not put
  any alcohol into it." They do not know what you have learned, that
  alcohol is always formed in fermented juices which contain sugar. It does
  not wait to be put into the home-made wines; it quietly comes in as they
  are getting made, at home or any other place, and will make people drunk
  as surely as when it is found in brandy or any other liquor.</p>

  <p>Some of the wines in the stores are made from grape juice, but many
  more are made by mixing hurtful and poisonous things together to make the
  liquor strong, and give it what is called a fine color and good
  taste.</p>

  <p><b><i>Beer and Ales.</i></b>&mdash;These are made from grains and
  hops, which contain no sugar, it is true, but are composed of starch,
  which may be changed into sugar. When a seed of grain is put into the
  ground and begins to grow, the starch in it becomes sugar, which feeds
  the young plant. When a brewer wishes to make beer, he takes some grain,
  puts it in a dark place, wets it, and leaves it to sprout, or begin to
  grow. Then he puts it into an oven to dry it, and make it stop growing.
  This makes what is called <i>malt</i>. The malt is mashed and soaked in
  warm water to get the sugar out of it; this forms a liquid called
  <i>sweet wort</i>. The wort is separated from the mashed grain and
  boiled; yeast is mixed with it to help it to ferment more quickly; it
  soon becomes changed; a dirty yellow scum filled with bubbles comes to
  the top, which we know is the poisonous carbonic acid gas; <!-- Page 79
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[79]</span> the
  other poison, alcohol, stays in the liquid and makes the beer taste good
  to those who like it.</p>

  <p>Liquors made from grain are called <i>malt liquors</i>. Lager beer,
  and all kinds of ales and porters, are malt liquors. They make people
  dull, sluggish, and stupid who drink much of them. They do much mischief
  in the body, though it takes a larger quantity of any one of them to make
  a person drunk than it does of whiskey or brandy.</p>

<p class="center">DISTILLATION.</p>

  <p>How does the sugar in grapes and other fruits become
  alcohol?&mdash;"By fermenting." Yes, and liquors made by fermenting are
  called <i>fermented liquors</i>. What other alcoholic drinks have you
  heard about beside cider, wines, beer, and ales?&mdash;"Gin, whiskey,
  brandy, rum." These are stronger than the fermented liquors, that is,
  they contain more alcohol; they are made by what is called
  <i>distillation</i>.</p>

  <p>If you boil water, and let the steam from it fall upon a cold plate,
  the steam will change back into liquid and become <!-- Page 80 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[80]</span>
  <i>distilled</i> water. Making a liquid boil, catching the vapor or steam
  and cooling it, is what we mean by distillation.</p>

  <p>If two or more liquids are mixed together, the one that boils with the
  least heat will be drawn off first. The alcohol of beer, cider, and wines
  is mixed with water; it boils at a lower heat than water, so can be drawn
  off from it very easily. This does not make more alcohol, it only makes
  the alcohol stronger by separating it from the water.</p>

  <p>When beer or any other alcoholic liquor is to be distilled, it is
  poured into a large copper boiler, called a <i>still</i>, and boiled. A
  tube carries the vapor from the boiler into a cask filled with cold
  water. This tube is coiled like a spiral line or worm through the cask;
  it is called <i>the worm of the still</i>, and the cask is <i>the
  worm-tub</i>. As the vapor passes through the tube, it cools and drops
  out at the end into the worm-tub, changed into a liquid stronger in
  alcohol than that from which it was drawn or distilled.</p>

  <p>In this way gin is made from beer, brandy from wine, and rum from
  fermented molasses. These are very strong drinks, and only hard drinkers
  like them. But very few people begin by taking these; they first learn to
  like alcohol by drinking cider, beer, or wine, and end with gin, whiskey,
  or rum when they have become drunkards.</p>

  one is bitten and dies from the dreadful hydrophobia, people are ready to
  destroy all the dogs of the neighborhood; but when a drunkard dies from
  delirium tremens or alcohol craziness, how few take any notice of the
  cause of his death, or do all they can to wage war against the use of
  alcoholic liquors.</p>

  <p>But why do we say such hard things against these liquors which some
  people love so well and think so harmless? In what way do they hurt and
  kill people? Let us see. Where does what we drink go after it has been
  put into the mouth?&mdash;"Into the stomach." If it were the right thing
  to go into the stomach, into what would it be changed?&mdash;"Into
  something which helps to make good blood."</p>

  <p>Learned men, who have examined and carefully studied about these
  things, tell us that <i>the stomach is hurt</i> by alcohol, <!-- Page 82
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[82]</span>
  because the fiery fluid is not food, but poison which makes the stomach
  very sore, and gives it hard work to do. The veins of the stomach take it
  up and send it into the liver. The liver, which is a large organ weighing
  about four pounds, lies on the right side below the lungs; its work is,
  to help make the blood pure. It can do nothing with alcohol, so it drives
  it along to the heart; the heart sends it to the lungs; the lungs throw
  some of it out through the breath, which smells of the vile stuff that
  has been poisoning every part it has passed through since it entered the
  mouth.</p>

  <p>Some of the alcohol does not get out of the lungs through the breath,
  but goes with the blood back to the heart, and from the heart is sent
  through the arteries to every part of the body. No part of the body wants
  it.</p>

  <p><i>The Skin</i> drives some of it out, through its little pores, with
  the perspiration.</p>

  <p><i>The Kidneys</i>, which lie in the back below the waist, on each
  side of the spine, send off some of the poison.</p>

  <p>Yet some of it gets into <i>the brain</i>, and there does very much
  mischief, of which you will learn more by and by. You know, if the brain
  is hurt, the mind cannot do its work of thinking properly; thus, alcohol
  does great <i>harm to the mind</i> through the brain.</p>

  <p><i>The muscles</i> and <i>the bones</i> are hurt by not being supplied
  with pure blood; <i>the heart</i> gets tired out with overwork, and
  <i>the lungs</i> become diseased through this same terrible alcohol.</p>

  <p>Therefore, if you would be strong and healthy, have nothing to do with
  alcoholic liquors; for</p>

<p class="center">IN THE STOMACH.</p>

  <p>Children who have learned the Lesson on Digestion, and know about the
  coats of the stomach, about mastication and chyme-making, are easily made
  to understand why anything which has alcohol in it is unfit to go into
  the stomach.</p>

  <p>If we touch a drop of alcohol to the eye, it will make it sore; so
  alcohol in the stomach irritates its coats and makes them sore.</p>

  <p>Alcohol poisons the gastric juice. If we get some of this juice from
  the stomach of a calf which has just been killed, and mix alcohol with
  it, the alcohol will separate the watery part from the <i>pepsin</i> or
  white part. This is what alcohol does in the stomach. It takes up water
  from the gastric juice, which prevents the pepsin from mixing well with
  the food, and hinders the change of the food into chyme, which cannot
  take place without pepsin.</p>

  <p>The children have already learned that alcohol keeps meat from
  decaying, or going to pieces. We explain that food in the stomach must go
  to pieces to prepare it to make blood; when mixed with alcohol, it is
  preserved, and the gastric juice cannot melt or dissolve it. Thus the
  stomach is hindered from doing its work until it gets rid of the
  alcohol.</p>

  <p>A true story we have read will help you to remember how troublesome
  alcohol is to the stomach. Some men in Edinburgh were paid their wages,
  one Saturday, soon after they had eaten their dinner. They got drunk and
  remained so till the next day at noon. When they became sober they had a
  headache and were so ill that they sent for a doctor; he gave them some
  medicine which brought up their Saturday's dinner just as it had gone
  down into the stomach. The poor stomach could do nothing with dinner
  mixed with whiskey or rum, because these liquors are half alcohol.</p>

  <p>You have already learned that the stomach hurries to drive out the
  alcohol into the liver; the liver sends it with the blood into the heart;
  the heart pours it into the lungs; the lungs breathe it out through the
  nose and mouth, and tell that some kind of alcoholic liquor has been
  taken into the stomach.</p>

<p><!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[84]</span></p>

  <p>Remember, that the alcohol which comes out in the breath is a part of
  that which <i>went into the mouth</i>. It could not be changed. It did
  nothing but mischief in its journey, which shows that it is not food, but
  poison. God, who created the body, has not given any part of it power to
  change alcohol into blood.</p>

  <p>People sometimes take ale or wine because they think it gives them an
  appetite. This is a great mistake. When any alcoholic liquor goes into
  the stomach, there is such hard work to get it out that the pain of
  hunger is not felt; when it is out, the stomach is tired and does not
  tell the brain that it is hungry. When alcohol is poured into it, day
  after day, it loses its desire for good, wholesome food, <i>and wants
  more and more alcoholic liquor</i>. It has an appetite for alcohol.</p>

  <p>Alcohol makes the stomach sore and full of disease; people who take
  much of it in liquors always suffer much from dyspepsia.</p>

  <p>So, if the stomach could speak, it would say: "Don't pour any alcohol
  into me, though you mix it and call it ale, cider, wine, or any other
  name that makes folks think it will do me no harm. You cannot deceive me.
  I know alcohol as soon as it comes down, and it always makes me
  suffer."</p>

<p><!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p class="center">TO THE BONES, MUSCLES, AND SKIN.</p>

  <p><b><i>To the Bones.</i></b>&mdash;You have already learned that the
  bones require to be supplied with good blood to make them strong and
  healthy, and that alcohol does not make good blood, so we need spend no
  time in deciding that alcoholic liquors do injury to the bones, and that
  the bones of those who drink these liquors are less likely to heal, when
  broken, than those of persons whose blood has not been poisoned by
  alcohol.</p>

  <p><b><i>To the Muscles.</i></b>&mdash;The muscles, as you know, cover
  and move the bones; good blood makes them grow, and keeps them healthy
  and strong. People like to have plenty of good muscle, for this not only
  gives them strength, but makes them look plump and well.</p>

  <p>Alcohol poisons the blood by killing many of the very little, round,
  red parts in it, called by a long name, which you can learn if you try.
  This hard name is <i>corpuscles</i> [kor'pussls]; <i>corpuscle</i> means
  <i>a little body</i>.</p>

  <p>These little bodies float in the fluid portion of the blood, and go to
  every part of the body to help keep it alive and healthy. When alcohol
  hurts them, they turn into a poor kind of fat, like suet, and cannot do
  any good. They stay in different parts and do much harm. Sometimes they
  lodge between the muscles, and make a person look strong because plump;
  but he is not strong, for his muscles are filled with fat.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the liver or the heart, which are only large muscles, become
  so heavy and soft with fat that they cannot do their work properly; they
  become weak and diseased, wear out, and cause the death of their owner,
  who has poisoned them with ale, wine, or other alcoholic drink.</p>

  <p><b><i>To the Skin.</i></b>&mdash;Alcohol hurts the skin also, by
  feeding it with poisoned blood, by giving the pores extra work in
  carrying off some of the alcohol in the perspiration, and by making the
  little blood-vessels larger than they should be in a way you will learn
  more about by and by. These little blood-vessels become very full of
  blood, and cause the red face and blue nose which <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[86]</span> mark the
  drinker of alcoholic liquors. This redness of the skin tells of the
  mischief which alcohol is doing inside of the body. It is the
  danger-signal which warns against the use of the fiery poison.</p>

<p class="center">TO THE BLOOD, THE LUNGS, AND THE HEART.</p>

  <p><b><i>To the Blood.</i></b>&mdash;The wonderful fluid which is the
  life of the body consists of a water-like liquid in which floats millions
  of the very little, circle-shaped, red particles which you have been
  taught to call <i>corpuscles</i>. You have also been told that alcohol
  kills these little bodies, and thus takes some of the life out of the
  blood, and fills it with useless, suet-like fat.</p>

  <p>The blood, you know, flows everywhere through the body, giving its
  goodness to make every part grow and live, and carrying away the worn-out
  particles it meets. Blood, when poisoned with alcohol, goes through the
  body, giving disease and death instead of health and life. So, if you
  want good, red blood, do not let alcohol get into it.</p>

  <p><b><i>To the Heart.</i></b>&mdash;When alcohol comes with the blood
  from the liver, the heart begins to beat fast to get rid of the
  firewater; this makes it very tired, for it always has enough to do in
  carrying bad blood to the lungs, and pumping good blood into the
  arteries, without having the extra trouble of driving out alcohol. Wise
  people will not give it this extra work to do.</p>

  <p>Besides, we told you, in the talk about the harm done by alcohol to
  the muscles, that the heart,&mdash;which is only a large <!-- Page 87
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[87]</span>
  muscle, or rather many muscles fastened together so as to make a
  pear-shaped organ about the size of your fist,&mdash;is hurt in another
  way by alcohol. It gets too much of the poor kind of fat from the blood,
  which fills between the muscles, and after awhile makes the walls of the
  heart so soft and weak, that we could almost push through them with a
  finger, if we could get at them.</p>

  <p>Very often the tired, overworked, weakened heart suddenly stops
  beating, and the person who would keep on drinking beer, wine, brandy, or
  rum falls down dead. "Died from heart disease," people say, when the
  truth is, <i>died from drinking alcoholic liquors</i>.</p>

  <p><b><i>To the Lungs.</i></b>&mdash;What are the lungs?&mdash;"The
  breathing-machines of the body." What do they throw out?&mdash;"Bad air."
  What do they take in?&mdash;"Fresh air." In pure air there is a good kind
  of gas which is necessary to keep us alive; this gas is called
  <i>oxygen</i>.</p>

  <p>When air is taken into the lungs, the oxygen mixes with the blood in
  them and makes it pure. If alcohol is in the lungs, it hardens the walls
  of their air-cells, and keeps out the oxygen or good gas; at the same
  time it keeps in the impure gas, called <i>nitrogen</i>, which ought to
  come out through the nose and mouth into the air. Thus the blood in the
  lungs cannot be properly purified, and goes back to the heart impure
  blood which is unfit to be used.</p>

  <p>The lungs are also obliged to work faster when alcohol is in them,
  because with the heart they are striving to drive out the enemy. This
  makes the lungs tired, sore, and inflamed. They are not as strong to do
  their work, and are more likely to breathe in any contagious disease than
  are the lungs of people who do not drink alcoholic liquors.</p>

  <p>Some people go on drinking these poisons for many years, and seem not
  to be hurt by them; but at last they suffer from what is called Alcoholic
  Phthisis, a kind of consumption which doctors cannot cure.</p>

<p class="center">TO THE BRAIN AND NERVES.</p>

  <p>Where is your brain?&mdash;"In my skull." What color is
  it?&mdash;"Gray and white." What does it resemble?&mdash;"Marrow." What
  work is done in the brain?&mdash;"The work of thinking." You may repeat
  what you have learned about the membranes of the brain. (See Formula for
  the Lesson on the Nervous System.)</p>

<p><!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[89]</span></p>

  <p>You say "the inner membrane is a net-work of blood-vessels." If these
  are blood-vessels in the membranes, what fills them?&mdash;"Blood." Do
  you think alcohol can get into the brain?&mdash;"Yes." How can it get
  there?&mdash;"It goes there with the blood." How can we know that alcohol
  does mischief in the brain? You cannot answer? Did you never see a
  drunken man? Now tell me how you might know his brain has been hurt by
  alcohol.&mdash;"He talks funny; he acts strangely; he is very cross; he
  does not know what he is doing; he walks crookedly; he falls down;
  sometimes he falls asleep, and is almost like a dead man; he is dead
  drunk."</p>

  <p>Let us study to learn why the drunken man does such strange things.
  The alcohol in this bottle, and this egg which you see, will help us find
  the cause of the mischief. You may tell what is in the egg.&mdash;"A
  white liquid and a yellow liquid." How could they be made hard?&mdash;"By
  making the egg hot; by boiling." We will try what alcohol will do to the
  white part. You see when it is poured upon the white of the egg it
  hardens this part as boiling would harden it. This white portion is
  composed of water and something called <i>albumen</i>. The alcohol dries
  up the water and thickens the albumen.</p>

  <p>Albumen is found not only in eggs but in some seeds, as beans, peas,
  corn, etc., also in the gray part of the brain and in the nerves.</p>

  <p>We will talk first of the harm alcohol does to the nerves. You know
  they are the grayish-white cords which pass from the brain and the spine
  to every part of the body. What do they act like in the kind of work they
  do?&mdash;"Like telegraph wires." What is their work?&mdash;"To carry
  messages to and from the brain." What kinds of nerves have you learned
  about?&mdash;"Nerves of feeling and nerves of motion."</p>

  <p>When alcohol touches a nerve, it draws away the moisture or water from
  it, and hardens the white part or albumen; this makes the nerve shrivel
  as if it had been burned; it loses its power to feel and move, or, to use
  a long word, is <i>paralyzed</i>.</p>

  <p>Alcohol paralyzes all the nerves it touches. It makes them <!-- Page
  90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[90]</span>
  so stupid that they cannot understand what the brain says to them, and
  they do not carry the right messages back to it. For instance: when the
  nerves of the stomach are poisoned by the alcohol in beer, wine, etc.,
  they do not feel the pain of hunger as much as they otherwise would, and
  they let the brain think the stomach is satisfied and does not need any
  more food, when it is only stupefied by these liquors.</p>

  <p>Again, it is the work of some nerves to tell the muscles of the small
  arteries to tighten, or contract, when too much blood is coming into
  them. Alcohol so paralyzes these nerves that they do not carry their
  message; the arteries let in the blood, and become swollen and enlarged.
  They tell the mischief done to them, by causing the skin to be red or
  flushed. If people drink much of any intoxicating liquor, and often,
  their skin is always a bad color, or, as grown folks say, becomes
  permanently discolored. All this because the nerves have been made unfit
  to do their duty by alcohol poison.</p>

  <p>The nerves also lose power over the muscles of the limbs. This is
  plainly seen in the trembling of the hands and the unsteady walking of
  the drunkard; but is equally true of those who drink only a little now
  and then. Their nerves are not as strong and wide-awake to control the
  machinery of the body as they would be if no alcohol were troubling
  them.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the nerves of hearing and sight tell the brain queer
  stories, and the poor brain believes them all, for it, too, is stupefied
  by the same fire-water which has hurt the nerves. Indeed, the harm done
  by alcohol to the brain is greater than that done to any other part of
  the body. It takes the water from the albumen, and makes the white part
  of the brain hard, as if it had been cooked. It kills the little,
  circle-shaped, red parts of the blood&mdash;the corpuscles; these collect
  in the blood-vessels of the brain, and keep the blood from flowing as
  fast as it ought, which causes disease and very often death. Sometimes
  the brain is so much injured by the poison that the drinker becomes
  crazy, and is a great deal of trouble to himself and everybody else.</p>

<p><!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[91]</span></p>

  <p>Since all this is true, wise children will let cider, lager, ale,
  wine, and every other kind of alcoholic drink alone, and never,
  NEVER,</p>

<p class="center">MORE ABOUT THE HARM DONE BY ALCOHOL.</p>

  <p>In the lessons you have learned you have been taught about the harm
  done by alcohol to the body and the mind; can you tell, from what you
  have seen of drunken people, in what other way alcoholic liquors hurt
  them?&mdash;"They make people waste their money; they make them waste
  their time; they make them cross; they make them fight; they make them
  say silly and wicked words; they sometimes make fathers and mothers hurt
  their children; they make people lose their good name; they often make
  them do things for which they are sent to prison."</p>

  <p>Yes, this is only some of the mischief done by alcohol. If you could
  fly around the world and see everybody who has been hurt in any way by
  this terrible poison, what a sad, sad sight you would behold! At least
  half the trouble in the world comes from strong drink.</p>

  <p>Are <i>you</i>, little girl, little boy, going to join the army of
  drunkards? No, indeed! you think; but probably no one who has become a
  drunkard ever intended to do so. They all began <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[92]</span> with one
  glass, a few drops of some alcoholic liquor,&mdash;cider, wine, or beer
  perhaps,&mdash;and thus learned to love the taste of alcohol, and soon
  became its slaves. For this poison has the strange power of making those
  who drink it want more and more of itself, though they know it is doing
  them harm.</p>

  <p>The only safety is in letting alcoholic liquors alone, forever.</p>

<p class="center">STORIES ABOUT THE HARM DONE BY ALCOHOL.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A YOUNG BEGINNER.&mdash;The hardest drinker I ever knew commenced on
  cider when he was only five years old. He would go to the barrel of cider
  in the cellar, which had been put there to make vinegar, and, getting a
  straw, would suck all the cider he wanted; and then, after he had played
  awhile, he would go back and get more. He kept on drinking alcoholic
  liquors of some kind, until he died a drunkard.</p>

  <p>CIDER DELIRIUM.&mdash;Dr. J.H. Travis, of Masonville, N.Y., was once
  called to a child six years old, who was raving in the wildest delirium.
  His symptoms were so peculiar that he questioned the family closely, and
  found that the day previous, at a raising, the child had drank freely of
  cider. After the men left he had procured a straw and gone to the barrel
  and drank till he was senseless, and after this the delirium <!-- Page 93
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[93]</span>
  came on. He exhibited undoubted symptoms of delirium tremens. Cider was
  the common beverage of the family. Dr. Travis has been called to several
  other cases of delirium tremens from the use of cider.&mdash;<i>Mrs. E.J.
  Richmond.</i></p>

  <p>A CAUTION TO MOTHERS.&mdash;One of the first literary men in the
  United States said to a temperance lecturer: "There is one thing which I
  wish you to do everywhere; entreat every mother never to give a drop of
  strong drink to a child. I have had to fight as for my life all my days
  to keep from dying a drunkard, because I was fed with spirits when a
  child. I thus acquired an appetite for it. My brother, poor fellow, died
  a drunkard."</p>

  <p>A GIRL DRUNKARD.&mdash;A young girl of eighteen, beautiful,
  intelligent, and temperate, the pride of her home, was recommended to
  take a little gin for some chronic ailment. She took it; it soothed the
  pain; she kept on taking it; it created an artificial appetite, and in
  four years she died a drunkard.&mdash;<i>Medical Temperance
  Journal.</i></p>

  <p>"A LITTLE WON'T HURT HIM."&mdash;I was the pet of the family. Before I
  could well walk I was treated to the sweet from the bottom of my father's
  glass. My dear mother would gently chide with him, "Don't, John, it will
  do him harm." To this he would smilingly reply, "This little sup won't
  hurt him." When I became a school-boy I was ill at times, and my mother
  would pour for me a glass of wine from the decanter. At first I did not
  like it; but, as I was told that it would make me strong, I got to like
  it. When I became an apprentice, I reasoned thus: "My parents told me
  that these drinks are good, and I cannot get them except at the
  public-house." Step by step I fell.... I have grown to manhood, but my
  course of intemperance has added sin to sin. My days are now nearly
  ended. Hope for the future I have none.&mdash;<i>Dying Drunkard.</i></p>

  <p>DANGER.&mdash;In one of Mr. Moody's temperance prayer meetings at
  Chicago, a reformed man attributed a former relapse of drunkenness wholly
  to a physician's prescription to take whiskey three times a day!</p>

  <p>KILLED BY THE POISON.&mdash;Many years ago, when stage coaches were in
  use in England, during a very cold night, a young woman mounted the
  coach. A respectable tradesman sitting there asked her what induced her
  to travel on such a night, when she replied that she was going to the
  bedside of her mother, of whose illness she had just heard. She was soon
  wrapped in such coats, etc., as the passengers could spare, and when they
  stopped the tradesman procured her some <!-- Page 94 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[94]</span> brandy. She
  declined it at first, saying she had never drank spirits in her life. But
  he said, "Drink it down; it won't hurt you on such a bitter night." This
  was done repeatedly, until the poor girl fell fast asleep, and when they
  arrived in London she could not be roused. She was stiff and cold in
  death, and the doctor, on the coroner's inquest, said that she had been
  killed by the brandy.&mdash;<i>Mrs. Balfour.</i></p>

  <p>IN CASE OF SHIPWRECK.&mdash;In the winter of 1796 a vessel was wrecked
  on an island of the Massachusetts coast, and five persons on board
  determined to swim ashore. Four of them drank freely of spirits to keep
  up their strength, but the fifth would drink none. One was drowned, and
  all that drank spirits failed and stopped, and froze one after another,
  the man that drank none being the only one that reached the house at some
  distance from, the shore, and he lived many years after that.</p>

  <p>IT EXHAUSTS STRENGTH.&mdash;Concerning one cold winter when there were
  very severe snow-storms in the Highlands of Scotland, James Hogg, the
  poet, says: "It was a received opinion all over the country that sundry
  lives were lost, and a great many more endangered, by the administration
  of ardent spirits to the sufferers <i>while in a state of exhaustion</i>.
  A little bread and sweet milk, or even bread and cold water, proved a
  much safer restorative in the fields. Some who took a glass of spirits
  that night never spoke another word, even though they were continuing to
  walk and converse when their friends joined them. One woman found her
  husband lying in a state of insensibility; she had only sweet milk and
  oatmeal cake to give him, but with these she succeeded in getting him
  home and saving him."&mdash;<i>Bacchus.</i></p>

  <p>SHIPMASTER OF THE KEDRON.&mdash;"I was brought up in a temperance
  school, and when I shipped before the mast I stuck to my principles,
  though everyone else on board drank excepting two boys whom I persuaded
  to abstain. In a very severe storm off a lee-shore, when it was so cold
  they had to break the icicles off the ropes to tack the ship, all drank
  but myself and these two boys. The men would work very well for a few
  minutes, and then slack off and take another drink, until they were all
  keeled up, and we three boys had all we could do to keep the ship from
  going ashore. If we had drank with the rest, all would have been lost,
  for the men were too drunk to save themselves. Providentially, the storm
  abated before morning, and we were saved. Now, for many years I have been
  captain of my own ship, and I never give out one drop of
  liquor."&mdash;<i>Captain Brown.</i></p>

<p><!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[95]</span></p>

  <p>ON THE PLAINS.&mdash;Twenty-six men, travelling on one of the great
  Western plains in the United States, were overtaken by cold and night.
  They had food, clothing, and whiskey, but no fire. They were warned not
  to drink whiskey or they would freeze. Three did not drink a drop, and
  though they felt cold they did not suffer nor freeze. Three more drank a
  little, and though they suffered much they did not freeze. Seven others
  that drank a good deal had their toes and fingers frozen. Six that drank
  pretty strong were badly frozen and never got over it. Four that got very
  boozy were frozen so badly that they died three or four weeks afterward.
  Three that got dead drunk were stiff dead by daylight. They all suffered
  just in proportion to the amount of whiskey they took. They were all
  strong men, and had about the same amount of clothing and blankets; the
  whiskey was all that made the difference.</p>

  <p>THE RED RIVER EXPEDITION in Canada, in 1870, is often quoted as one of
  the most laborious on record, 1200 troops travelling 1200 miles through a
  very dense wilderness, and having all their supplies to carry. They were
  ninety-four days out, and none of them had liquor. They were constantly
  wet through, sometimes for days together, and all the while at the severe
  labor of rowing, poling, tracking, and portaging, yet they were always
  well and cheery, and there was a total absence of crime.</p>

  <p>IN AFRICA it is far safer to do without intoxicating drink.
  Livingstone says that he lived without it for twenty years. Stanley
  performed his wonderful journey without it. Bruce said more than one
  hundred, years ago: "I laid down as a positive rule of health that
  spirits and all fermented liquors should be regarded as poisonous.
  Spring, or running water, if you can find it, is to be your only
  drink."</p>

  <p>WATERTON, the great naturalist, who travelled so much in South
  America, says: "I eat moderately, and never drink wine, spirits, or any
  fermented liquors in any climate. This abstemiousness has proved a
  faithful friend." He died by accident at the age of eighty-three.</p>

  <p>MR. HUBER, who saw 2160 perish of cholera in twenty-five days in one
  town in Russia, says that "Persons given to drinking are swept away like
  flies. In Tiflis, containing 20,000 inhabitants, every drunkard has
  fallen." Of 204 cases of cholera in the Park Hospital, New York, there
  were but six temperate persons, and these recovered. In Albany, where
  cholera prevailed with severe mortality for several weeks, only two of
  the 5000 members of temperance societies became its victims. <!-- Page 96
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[96]</span> In
  Montreal, where the victims of the disease were intemperate, it usually
  cut them off. In Great Britain, those who have been addicted to
  spirituous liquors and irregular habits have been the greatest sufferers
  from cholera. In some towns the drunkards are all
  dead.&mdash;<i>Bacchus.</i></p>

  <p>MALT LIQUORS, under which title are included all kinds of porters and
  ales, produce the worst species of drunkenness. The effects of malt
  liquors are more stupefying than those of ardent spirits, and less easily
  removed. In a short time they render dull and sluggish the gayest
  disposition.&mdash;<i>Anatomy of Drunkenness.</i></p>

  <p>GINGER-BEER.&mdash;A man who has been a temperance-worker for
  forty-five years, says that there is often alcohol in ginger-beer. He
  told of a case known to him of a reformed man who, after drinking some,
  felt strongly drawn to the bar-room, where he drank until he brought on
  delirium tremens. The beer will sometimes ferment enough in a few hours
  to produce alcohol&mdash;if it answers the conditions&mdash;a sweet
  liquid and a ferment.</p>

  <p>DANGER TO THE REFORMED.&mdash;A lady who had become a drunkard through
  taking alcoholic drinks as medicines, at length, after many efforts,
  succeeded in breaking away from the power of the appetite, and for a long
  time she seemed to be saved. At length she went to visit her mother, and
  that mother put brandy peaches on the table for tea. They aroused the
  slumbering appetite, the victim fell again, became worse than ever, and
  died a miserable drunkard.</p>

<p class="center">STORIES ABOUT THE RIGHT WAY TO TREAT ALE, BEER, Etc.</p>

  <p>THE RIGHT SIDE.&mdash;"Boys, which is the right side of the public
  house? Can you tell me?"&mdash;"Yes, sir, the outside."</p>

  <p>THE GOAT AND THE ALE.&mdash;Many years ago, when everybody drank
  freely, a Welsh minister named Rees Pritchard was at the ale-house
  drinking, when he took it into his head to offer some ale to a large tame
  goat. The animal drank till he fell down drunk, and the minister drank on
  till he was carried home drunk. The next day he was sick all day, but on
  the third day he went again to the ale-house, and began to drink. The
  goat was there, and he offered him more ale, but the <!-- Page 97
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[97]</span>
  animal would not touch it. The minister, seeing the animal wiser than
  himself, was ashamed, and gave up drinking, and became a worthy
  minister.</p>

  <p>HOW THE MONKEY WAS CURED.&mdash;A monkey named Kees had been taught to
  drink brandy. At dinner every day he had his share like his more manly
  (?) neighbors, only that his was given to him in a plate. One day, as he
  was about to drink it, his master set it on fire, and he ran off
  frightened and chattering. No inducement could afterward make him drink
  brandy. We have many stories of animals who would never drink again after
  they had once experienced its effects.</p>

  <p>THE KEEN MARKSMAN does not poison his nerves and brain with alcohol.
  Angus Cameron, a Highlander, at the age of twenty, took the Queen's prize
  for the best marksmanship, and when he was twenty-two (in 1869), he won
  in the same way a cup worth $1000. He made the best shot each time that
  ever had been made in the contest, and neither of them has been beaten by
  anyone else. Angus is a slight, modest, unassuming young man, who had
  been a Band of Hope boy. When he was announced as the winner, and all the
  friends made an ado over him, and offered him a generous glass of
  champagne, he quietly refused their mistaken kindness, and kept his
  pledge.</p>

  <p>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, when a printer boy in London, would drink no beer,
  and his companions called him the water American, and wondered that he
  was stronger than they who drank beer. His companion at the press drank
  six pints of beer every day, and had it to pay for. He was not only saved
  the expense, but he was stronger than they, and better off in every way.
  If he had gone to drinking beer at that time, like the other printer
  boys, it is likely we should never have heard of him.</p>

  <p>OATMEAL DRINK.&mdash;"In Boulton and Watts' factory we saw an immense
  workman at the hottest and heaviest work, wielding a ponderous hammer,
  and asked him what liquor he drank. He replied by pointing to an immense
  vessel filled with water and oatmeal, to which the men went and drank as
  much as they liked." This is made by adding one pound fine oatmeal to
  each gallon of water, and is much used in factories and at heavy work of
  all kinds in Government works, instead of the old rations of alcoholic
  liquors. Iron puddlers, glass blowers, and athletic trainers, all do
  their work now better without alcoholic liquors.</p>

<p><!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[98]</span></p>

  <p>A CHANGE IN AFFAIRS.&mdash;A poor boy was once put as an apprentice to
  a mechanic; and, as he was the youngest, he was obliged to go for beer
  for the older apprentices, though he never drank it. In vain they teased
  and taunted him to induce him to drink; he never touched it. Now there is
  a great change. Every one of those older apprentices became a drunkard,
  while this temperance boy has become a master, and has more than a
  hundred men in his employ. So much for total abstinence.</p>

  <p>BOOKS BETTER THAN BEER.&mdash;An intelligent young mechanic stood up
  in a temperance meeting and said: "I have a rich treat every night among
  my books. I saved my beer money and spent it in books. They cost me, with
  my book-case, nearly $100. They furnish enjoyment for my winter evenings,
  and have enabled me, by God's blessing, to gain much useful knowledge,
  such as pots and pipes could never have given me."</p>

  <p>A LITTLE DRUMMER-BOY was a favorite among the officers, who one day
  offered him a glass of strong drink. He refused it, saying that he was a
  Cadet of Temperance. They accused him of being afraid; but that did not
  move him. Then the major commanded him to drink, saying: "You know it is
  death to disobey orders." The little fellow stood up at his full height,
  and fixing his clear blue eyes on the face of the officer, he said: "When
  I entered the army I promised my mother on bended knees that, by the help
  of God, I would not taste a drop of rum, and I mean to keep my promise. I
  am sorry to disobey orders, sir, but I would rather suffer than disgrace
  my mother, and break my temperance pledge." He was excused from
  drinking.</p>

<h3>TOBACCO.</h3>

<p class="center">INTRODUCTORY LESSON.</p>

  <p>You have been learning about the poison alcohol, and what mischief is
  done by it; we will now study about another poison which thousands of
  persons are using every day. It is rolled in cigars and cigarettes, and
  hidden in snuff and pieces of tobacco, and does more harm to children and
  young people who use these things than to grown persons.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you know how a person feels who takes tobacco or smokes a
  cigar for the first time; if not, we will tell you. He begins to be
  dizzy, to tremble, to become faint, and to vomit; his head aches, and he
  is so sick for hours, often for several days, that he scarcely knows what
  to do. Why is he so sick? Because tobacco poison has been taken into his
  lungs; also, some has mixed with the saliva and gone down into his
  stomach; and each part it has reached is striving to drive it out, and is
  saying, by the pain it causes, "You have given me poison; do not give me
  any more." If he had taken enough it would have killed him.</p>

  <p>He recovers from this sickness and tries chewing or smoking again and
  again, until he becomes accustomed to the poison and can chew or smoke
  and it does not hurt him; so he thinks, but he is very much mistaken.</p>

  <p>Tobacco is a poison, and hurts everybody who uses it every time they
  do so, although it does its evil work very slowly, unless taken in large
  quantities. To understand more about this we will try to learn how
  tobacco is obtained, what poison is in it, and in what way it harms
  people.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center">THE STORY ABOUT TOBACCO.</p>

  <p><b><i>How it Came to be Used.</i></b>&mdash;Tobacco is the leaves of
  the tobacco plant, a native of America. It was used by the Indians of
  this country before Columbus came here in 1492. Some of the Spaniards who
  were with him on his second visit took some of it back with them to
  Portugal, and told the people they had discovered a wonderful medicine.
  From Spain tobacco seed was sent to France by Jean Nicot, in 1560. It is
  said that Sir Walter Raleigh carried it to England in 1586, when
  Elizabeth was queen.</p>

  <p>In a few years many civilized people were snuffing, chewing, and
  smoking tobacco, like the wild Indians, although it cost them a great
  deal of money to do so. King James does not seem to have liked it very
  much, for he said, "It is a custome loathsome to the eye, hateful to the
  nose, harmful to the brain, and dangerous to the lungs." He called the
  smoke "stinking fumes."</p>

  <p><b><i>The Tobacco Plant.</i></b> This plant belongs to the same family
  as the deadly nightshade, henbane, belladonna, thorn-apple, Jerusalem
  cherry, potato, tomato, egg-plant, cayenne pepper, bitter-sweet, and
  petunia. Most of the plants of this Nightshade family have more or less
  poison in their leaves or fruit. Tobacco is supposed to have been named
  from the pipe used by the Indians in smoking its leaves.</p>

  <p>The common tobacco plant grows from three to six feet high, and has
  large, almost lance-shaped, leaves growing down the stems; its flowers
  are funnel-shaped and of a purplish color. When fresh the leaves have
  very little odor or taste.</p>

  <p><b><i>How Tobacco is Used.</i></b>&mdash;When the plants are ripe,
  they are cut off above the roots and placed where they will become dry,
  sometimes in a building made for this purpose, called "a tobacco house."
  After a short time they begin to smell strong and taste bitter. They are
  then stripped from the stems very carefully and sorted. The leaves
  nearest the root are considered the poorest, those at the top generally
  the best.</p>

<p><!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[101]</span></p>

  <p>The different sorts are packed in separate hogsheads, and sent away to
  be sold to manufacturers of cigars, snuff, etc.</p>

  <p>The manufacturer has some leaves rolled into cigars, some pressed into
  cakes for chewing, or into little pieces to be smoked in a pipe; while
  some are ground for snuff. While the dried leaves are being rolled,
  pressed, or ground, various substances are mixed with them to give them
  an agreeable odor and pleasant taste.</p>

  <p>Yet, however pleasant the manufacturer may make them as he rolls,
  presses, or grinds, he cannot take the poison out of them. It remains in
  its brown covering to do much harm to those who may smoke the cigars, use
  the snuff, or chew the tobacco.</p>

<p class="center">THE POISON IN TOBACCO AND THE HARM IT DOES.</p>

  <p><b><i>The Poison.</i></b>&mdash;What is the poison in fermented
  liquors?&mdash;"Alcohol." In distilled liquors?&mdash;"Alcohol" True; and
  the strongest poison in tobacco is <i>nicotine</i>, named from the man
  who first sent it to France, Jean Nicot. Beside this it contains several
  others, some of which we shall tell you about when we make up our
  blackboard outline.</p>

  <p>Tobacco, like alcohol, is a narcotic; that is, it soothes pain and
  produces sleep. Alcohol acts first upon the nerves; tobacco upon the
  muscles, which it weakens and causes to tremble. It often causes
  palpitation of the heart.</p>

  <p>If the skin is scratched or punctured, and tobacco poison put into the
  wound, it will do the same harm as if it were taken into the stomach.
  Tobacco is so dangerous that physicians do not use it much as a
  medicine.</p>

  <p><b><i>Harm done in the Stomach.</i></b>&mdash;You remember that after
  alcohol has been swallowed, the little mouths of the stomach take it up
  and carry it to the liver, which sends it with the blood to different
  parts of the body.</p>

  <p>Tobacco, as we have already told you, poisons more slowly. People do
  not swallow it purposely, yet some of it goes down, accidentally, into
  the stomach with the saliva, and makes trouble there, causing nausea and
  vomiting when taken for the first time. By and by the stomach seems to
  take the poison without being hurt, but it really suffers from dyspepsia
  or other diseases, and often loses its appetite for wholesome food.</p>

  <p><b><i>Harm done in the Mouth, Throat, and Lungs.</i></b>&mdash;The
  mouth takes in some of the poison through the pores of the membrane, or
  skin, which lines it; those who smoke, sometimes have what is called
  "smokers' sore throat"; besides this, the senses of taste and smell arc
  more or less injured by nicotine and the other poisons in tobacco.</p>

  <p>The fumes, or smoke, from the weed fills the air with poisonous <!--
  Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"
  id="page103"></a>[103]</span> vapor which irritates the lungs, not only
  of the smoker, but of all who are where they must breathe the same
  atmosphere. Lungs thus irritated are liable to become diseased.</p>

  <p>Cigarettes are still more injurious than cigars because of the smoke
  from their paper coverings; also, because from the way they are made,
  more of the tobacco poison goes into the lungs. The cheap cigarette which
  boys use is made from cast-away cigar stumps and other filthy things.</p>

  <p><b><i>Harm done in the Brain and Nerves.</i></b>&mdash;The smoker
  feels so rested and comfortable, after his cigar, and his brain is so
  rested, that he does not think about the mischief that is going on among
  its blood-vessels and nerves; perhaps he has never heard that tobacco,
  snuffed, chewed, or smoked hurts the brain, and does not learn about it
  until he finds he is losing his memory, that his mind is not so strong to
  think as it should be, and his will too weak to help him conquer his love
  for the snuff, tobacco, or cigar, when he wishes to stop using it. He has
  become the slave of tobacco, and it is not easy to get free from his
  cruel enemy.</p>

  <p>The nerves also lose their power, or become more or less paralyzed by
  nicotine and the other tobacco poisons.</p>

  <p><b><i>More about the Harm done by Tobacco.</i></b>&mdash;Some persons
  who continue to use tobacco are strong enough to throw off the poison
  through the lungs, the skin, and in other ways; but how much better it
  would be if they were not obliged to employ their strength in getting rid
  of that which does them no good, which only gives a little pleasure to
  nobody but themselves, and often makes those suffer who are compelled to
  remain where they are having "a good smoke." Beside, their breath and
  clothing have the tobacco odor, which not only makes the air impure, but
  is disagreeable to most people.</p>

  <p>If this be true of smoking, what shall we say about the filthy habit
  of chewing, and the utterly useless and disgusting practice of taking
  snuff, which injures the voice as well as the senses of taste and smell?
  <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
  id="page104"></a>[104]</span></p>

  <p>And what about spitting tobacco juice on the floors of cars,
  steamboats, churches,&mdash;any place where it is convenient for the man
  or boy who has lost his common politeness in his love for tobacco?</p>

  <p>We must not forget that cigars, etc., cost money. No one who smokes,
  chews, or snuffs would throw away dollars and cents which might be put
  into the savings bank, or used in buying something worth having for
  himself or somebody else.</p>

  <p>Lastly, we would have you know that tobacco causes thirst, and this
  often leads to drinking alcoholic liquors. Some one who has studied this
  subject, says that "nine out of ten of the boys and young men who become
  drunkards have first learned to smoke or chew tobacco." A New York daily
  paper gave a list of 294 cases of insanity caused by drinking, in 246 of
  which the whiskey drinking followed tobacco chewing.</p>

  <p>Tobacco and alcohol make thousands of wretched homes, and send a great
  many people to prison or to the insane asylum; so we entreat you to turn
  from beer, wine, and all alcoholic liquors as you would from a serpent,
  and say No, when tempted to smoke a cigar or use tobacco in any form.</p>

  <p>Do this all the more decidedly because, as we have told you before,
  alcohol and tobacco hurt children and young persons in every way more
  than they injure any one else. If you have begun to use these poisons,
  give them up this very day, before the habit of using them becomes too
  strong for you to break.</p>

  <p>Of what poison beside alcohol have you been
  studying?&mdash;"Tobacco."</p>

  <p>How is tobacco used?&mdash;"Some take it in snuff; some chew it; some
  smoke it in a pipe; some smoke it in cigars or cigarettes."</p>

  <p>What is the name of the strongest poison in
  tobacco?&mdash;"Nicotine."</p>

  <p>What harm does tobacco poison do to the body?&mdash;See Blackboard
  Outline.</p>

  <p>What harm does it do to the mind?&mdash;See Blackboard Outline.</p>

  <p>Whom does it harm most?&mdash;"Those who begin to use it when they are
  children or very young."</p>

  <p>What happens to children or young people if they use tobacco in any
  way?&mdash;"They are not healthy; they are not strong; they do not grow
  fast; they look pale and sickly."</p>

<p><!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[105]</span></p>

  <p>How does the tobacco poison hurt their minds?&mdash;"They cannot learn

  <p>If you are wise how will you treat tobacco?&mdash;"I will let it
  alone."</p>

  <p>If you have begun to use it what had you better do?&mdash;"Give it up
  to-day."</p>

  <p>Why to-day?&mdash;"Because the longer I use it the harder it will be
  for me to give it up."</p>

  <p>If you keep on using it what will you be?&mdash;"A tobacco slave."</p>

<p class="center">OPIUM AND OTHER NARCOTICS.</p>

  <p><b><i>Opium.</i></b>&mdash;Opium is the juice obtained from the
  seed-vessels of the white poppy before they are ripe; this is dried, and
  smoked in a pipe or chewed. It makes a person feel very pleasant and
  happy for a little while, then so horribly wretched that he takes more of
  the poison to forget his misery. So he keeps on until mind and body are a
  complete wreck. Now and then an opium slave gets free from the dreadful
  habit which has mastered him, but usually the slavery ends only in
  death.</p>

  <p><b><i>Laudanum and Morphine.</i></b>&mdash;These soothe pain and cause
  sleep; but beware of them; they are made from opium, and like it, though
  more slowly, hurt mind and body.</p>

  <p>Beware also of <i>chloral hydrate</i> and <i>chloroform</i>, which
  physicians give to ease suffering and produce sleep. <i>Endure pain</i>
  rather than form the habit of using these narcotics.</p>

  <p><b><i>Hashish, etc.</i></b>&mdash;This is prepared from the hemp plant
  growing in hot countries, and is a terribly exciting poison.</p>

  <p>The <i>areca nut</i>, the seed from a kind of palm, pear-shaped, and
  resembling a nutmeg, is mixed with quick-lime and wrapped in a
  betel-leaf, which grows on a vine belonging to the pepper family. This
  mixture reddens the saliva and lips, and blackens the teeth. It is chewed
  by millions of people in India.</p>

  <p>The leaves of the <i>coca</i>, also of the <i>thorn apple</i>, are
  smoked or chewed by the South American Indian.</p>

<h2>Practical Work in the School-Room.</h2>

<h3>Part I.&mdash;THE HUMAN BODY.</h3>

<h3><i>TEACHERS' EDITION.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><b>A Transcript of Lessons given in the Primary Department of Grammar
School No. 49, New York City.</b></p>

  <p>This work was prepared especially to aid Teachers in giving oral
  instructions in Physiology to Primary and Intermediate Classes. It is,
  perhaps, the only Physiology published that is suitable for these grades.
  Considerable attention is paid to the subject of Alcohol and
  Narcotics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"First is given <i>a model lesson</i>; second, <i>a formula</i>,
  embodying the principal facts given during the development and teaching;
  third, <i>questions for the formula</i>; fourth, <i>directions for
  teaching</i>; and fifth, <i>questions on the lesson</i>. These last are
  important. A full plan of lessons is given for each week for five months,
  in each of six grades, showing exactly how much work ought to be
  attempted. No book could be made more helpful to teachers. To the
  thousands who are asking, 'Tell us how to teach,' here are full, minute,
  and correct instructions. Even the answers expected are given, blackboard
  outlines are arranged, and nothing is wanting to make the book as useful
  to teachers as it is possible for any book to be. It ought to have a
  large sale. No book published during the last ten years will do more to
  drive away routine from the school-room and introduce thought than this,
  <i>if only the teachers will use it</i>. Its introduction displaces
  nothing but the old-fashioned monotonous recitations. Let them go; we
  welcome this book as an important aid in hastening along the good time of
  better teaching. It is excellently printed, with good paper and
  binding."&mdash;<i>The New York School Journal.</i></p>

  seems to call for a new commendation of this admirable guide to teachers.
  Mr. DeGraff needs no special 'boom' as a first-class institute man, and
  his extracts of lectures in Part III. sparkle with valuable suggestions.
  In no published work is Col. Parker really seen to such advantage as in
  the 'reports of conversations' with him in Part II., which can be studied
  with profit by every teacher. But perhaps the most complete portion of
  this admirable book is the 178 pages of lessons on the Senses, Size,

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
