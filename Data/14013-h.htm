<p>Who is he among the children of the earth, that repines at the power of
the wicked? and who is he, that would change the lot of the righteous? He,
who has appointed to each his portion, is God; the Omniscient and the
Almighty, who fills eternity, and whose existence is from Himself!
<!-- Page 9 --><a name="Page_9"></a> but he who murmurs, is man; who
yesterday was not, and who to-morrow shall be forgotten: let him listen in
silence to the voice of knowlege, and hide the blushes of confusion in the
dust.</p>

<p>Solyman, the mighty and the wife, who, in the one hundred and second
year of the Hegyra, sat upon the throne of Persia, had two sons, <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
and they were twins. <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was the first
born, but Solyman divided his affection equally between them: they were
both lodged in the same part of the seraglio, both were attended by the
same servants, and both received instructions from the same teacher.</p>

<p>One of the first things that <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>
learnt, was the prerogative of his<!-- Page 10 --><a name="Page_10"></a>
birth; and he was taught very early to set a high value upon it, by the
terms in which those about him expressed their sense of the power, the
splendor, and the delights of royalty. As his mind gradually opened, he
naturally considered these as the objects of universal define, and the
means of supreme felicity: he was often reminded, that the time was
coming, when the sole possession of sovereign power would enable him to
fulfil all his wishes, to determine the fate of dependent nations with a
nod, and dispense life and death, and happiness and misery, at his will:
he was flattered by those who hoped to draw wealth and dignity from his
favour; and interest prompted all who approached him, to administer to
<!-- Page 11 --><a name="Page_11"></a> his pleasures with a zeal and
assiduity, which had the appearance of reverence to his merit, and
affection to his person.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, on the contrary, soon became
sensible of a subordinate station: he was not, indeed, neglected; but he
was not much caressed. When the gratification of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> came in competition with that of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, he was always obliged to give it up, except when Solyman
interposed: his mind was, therefore, naturally led to seek for happiness
in objects very different from those which had fixed the attention of
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>. As he knew not to how narrow a
sphere caprice or jealousy might confine him, he <!-- Page 12 --><a name=
"Page_12"></a>considered what pleasures were least dependent upon external
advantages; and as the first popular commotion which mould happen after
his brother's accession to the throne, might probably cost him his life,
he was very inquisitive about the state into which his spirit would be
dismissed by the Angel of Death, and very diligent to do whatever might
secure him a share of the permanent and unchangeable felicity of
Paradise.</p>

<p>This difference in the situation of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, produced great
dissimilarity in their dispositions, habits, and characters; to which,
perhaps, nature might also in some degree contribute. <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> was haughty, vain, and voluptuous; <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> <!-- Page 13 --><a name="Page_13"></a>was gentle,
courteous, and temperate: <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was
volatile, impetuous, and irascible; <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>
was thoughtful, patient, and forbearing. Upon the heart of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> also were written the instructions of the
Prophet; to his mind futurity was present by habitual anticipation; his
pleasure, his pain, his hopes, and his fears, were perpetually referred to
the Invisible and Almighty Father of Life, by sentiments of gratitude or
resignation, complacency or confidence; so that his devotion was not
periodical but constant.</p>

<p>But the views of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> were terminated
by nearer objects: his mind was perpetually busied in the anticipation of
pleasures and honours, which <!-- Page 14 --><a name="Page_14"></a>he
supposed to be neither uncertain nor remote; these excited his hopes, with
a power sufficient to fix his attention; he did not look beyond them for
other objects, nor enquire how enjoyments more distant were to be
acquired; and as he supposed these to be already secured to him by his
birth, there was nothing he was solicitous to obtain as the reward of
merit, nor any thing that he considered himself to possess as the bounty
of Heaven. If the sublime and disinterested rectitude that produces and
rewards itself, dwells indeed with man, it dwelt not with <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>: with respect to God, therefore, he was not
impressed with a sense either of duty or dependence; he felt neither
reverence nor love, gratitude nor resignation: in abstaining from evil, he
was not intentionally <!-- Page 15 --><a name="Page_15"></a>good; he
practised the externals of morality without virtue, and performed the
rituals of devotion without piety.</p>

<p>Such were <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> and <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, when Solyman their father, full of days and full
of honour, slept in peace the sleep of death. With this event they were
immediately acquainted. The emotions of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> were such as it was impossible to conceal: the joy that he
felt in secret was so great, that the mere dread of disappointment for a
moment suspended his belief of what he heard: when his fears and his
doubts gave way, his cheeks were suffused with sudden blushes, and his
eyes sparkled with exultation and impatience: he looked eagerly about him,
as if in haste to act; yet his looks were embarrassed, and his gestures
irresolute, <!-- Page 16 --><a name="Page_16"></a>because he knew not what
to do: he uttered some incoherent sentences, which discovered at once the
joy that he felt, and his sense of its impropriety; and his whole
deportment expressed the utmost tumult and perturbation of mind.</p>

<p>Upon <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, the death of his father
produced a very different effect: as soon as he heard it, his lips
trembled and his countenance grew pale; he flood motionless a moment, like
a pilgrim transfixed by lightning in the desert; he then smote his breast,
and looking upward, his eyes by degrees overflowed with tears, and they
fell, like dew distilling from the mountain, in a calm and silent shower.
As his grief was thus mingled with devotion, his <!-- Page 17 --><a name=
"Page_17"></a>mind in a short time recovered its tranquillity, though not
its chearfulness, and he desired to be conducted to his brother.</p>

<p>He found him surrounded by the lords of his court, his eye still
restless and ardent, and his deportment elate and assuming. <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> pressed hastily through the circle, and
prostrated himself before him: <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>
received the homage with a tumultuous pleasure; but at length raised him
from the ground, and assured him of his protection, though without any
expressions either of kindness or of sorrow: '<span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>,' says he, 'if I have no cause to complain of you
as a subject, you shall have no cause to complain of me as a king.' <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, whose <!-- Page 18 --><a name=
"Page_18"></a>heart was again pierced by the cold and distant behaviour of
his brother, suppressed the sigh that struggled in his bosom, and secretly
wiped away the tear that started to his eye: he retired, with his looks
fixed upon the ground, to a remote corner of the apartment; and though his
heart yearned to embrace his brother, his modest diffidence restrained him
from intruding upon the king.</p>

<p>In this situation were <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, when <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>
entered the apartment. <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, upon whose
head the hand of time became heavy, had from his youth acquainted himself
with wisdom: to him nature had revealed herself in the silence of the
night, when his lamp was burning alone, and his <!-- Page 19 --><a name=
"Page_19"></a>eyes only were open: to him was known the power of the Seal
of Solomon; and to him the knowlege of things invisible had been revealed.
Nor was the virtue of <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> inferior to his
knowlege; his heart was a fountain of good, which though it flowed through
innumerable streams was never dry: yet was the virtue of <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span> cloathed with humility; and he was still pressing
nearer to perfection, by a devotion which though elevated was rational,
and though regular was warm. From the council of <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span>, Solyman had derived glory and strength; and to him he had
committed the education of his children.</p>

<p>When he entered the apartment, the croud, touched at once with
reverence <!-- Page 20 --><a name="Page_20"></a>and love, drew back; every
eye was cast downward, and every tongue was silent. The full of days
approached the king, and kneeling before him he put into his hand a sealed
paper: the king received it with impatience, seeing it superscribed with
the hand of his father; and <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> looking
round, and perceiving <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, beckoned him
to come forward. <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, whose obedience to
<span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> had been so long habitual that it was
now almost spontaneous, instantly drew near, though with a flow and
irresolute pace; and <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, having broken
the seal of the paper, began to read it to himself, with a look that
expressed the utmost anxiety and impatience. <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span> kept his eye fixed upon him, and soon perceived that his
countenance was disfigured by <!-- Page 21 --><a name=
"Page_21"></a>confusion and trouble, and that he seemed preparing to put
up the paper in his bosom: he then produced another paper from under his
robe, and gave it to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>: 'This,' says
he, is a copy of the will of Solyman, your father; the original is in the
hand of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>: read it, and you will find
that he has bequeathed his kingdom between you.'</p>

<p>The eyes of all present were now turned upon <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, who stood silent and motionless with amazement, but was soon
roused to attention by the homage that was paid him. In the mean time,
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran's</span> confusion increased every moment:
his disappointment was aggravated by the sudden attention of those who
were present to his brother; <!-- Page 22 --><a name="Page_22"></a>and his
jealousy made him think himself neglected, while those acts of duty were
performed to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, which were now known to
be his right, and which he had himself received before him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, however, regarded but little what
so much excited the envy of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>; his
mind was employed upon superior objects, and agitated by nobler passions:
the coldness of his brother's behaviour, though it had grieved had not
quenched his affection; and as he was now no longer restrained by the
deference due from a subject to his king, he ran to him, and catching him
to his breast attempted to speak; but his heart was too full, and he could
express his affection and joy only by <!-- Page 23 --><a name=
"Page_23"></a>his tears. <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> rather
suffered than received the embrace; and after a few ceremonies, to which
neither of them could much attend, they retired to separate
apartments.</p>

<h2>CHAP. II.</h2>

<br />


<p>When <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was alone, he immediately
locked the door; and throwing himself upon a sofa in an agony of vexation
and disapointment, of which he was unwilling there should be any witness,
he revolved in his mind all the pleasures and honours of supreme dominion
which had now suddenly been snatched from him, with a degree of anguish
and regret, not proportioned to their real, but their imaginary value. Of
future good, that which we obtain is found to be less than our
expectations; but that of which we are disappointed, we suppose would have
been more: thus do the children of hope <!-- Page 25 --><a name=
"Page_25"></a>extract evil, both from what they gain, and from what they
lose. But <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, after the first tumult
of his mind had subsided, began to consider as well what was left him, as
what had been taken away. He was still without a superior, though he had
an equal; he was still a king, though he did not govern alone: and with
respect to every individual in his dominions, except one, his will would
now be a law; though with respect to the public, the concurrence of his
brother would be necessary to give it force. 'Let me then,' says he, 'make
the most of the power that is now put into my hand, and wait till some
favourable opportunity shall offer to increase it. Let me dissemble my
jealousy and disappointment, that I <!-- Page 26 --><a name=
"Page_26"></a>may not alarm suspicion, or put the virtues of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> upon their guard against me; and let me contrive
to give our joint administration such a form, as may best favour my
design.'</p>

<p>Such were the reflections, with which <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> soothed the anguish of his mind; while <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> was busied in speculations of a very different
kind. If he was pleased at reflecting, that he was raised from a subject
to a prince; he was pleased still more, when he considered his elevation
as a test of his father's affection to his person, and approbation of his
conduct: he was also delighted with the thought, that his brother was
associated with him in the arduous talk which he was <!-- Page 27 --><a
name="Page_27"></a>now called to perform. 'If I had been appointed to
govern alone,' said he, 'I should have had no equal; and he who has no
equal, though he may have faithful servants, can have no friend: there
cannot be that union of interests, that equal participation of good, that
unrestrained intercourse of mind, and that mutual dependence, which
constitutes the pure and exalted happiness of friendship. With <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, I shall share the supreme delight of
wresting the innocent and the helpless from the iron hand of oppression;
of animating merit by reward, and restraining the unworthy by fear: I
shall share, with <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, the pleasures of
governing a numerous, a powerful, and a happy people; <!-- Page 28 --><a
name="Page_28"></a>pleasures which, however great, are, like all others,
increased by participation.'</p>

<p>While <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was thus enjoying the
happiness, which his virtue derived from the same source, from which the
vices of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had filled his breast with
anguish and discontent; <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> was contriving
in what manner their joint government could best be carried into
execution.</p>

<p>He knew that Solyman, having considered the dispositions of his sons,
was of opinion, that if they had been blended in one person, they would
have produced a character more fit to govern in his stead, than either of
them alone: <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, he thought, was
<!-- Page 29 --><a name="Page_29"></a>too volatile and warm; but he
suspected, that <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> would sink into
inactivity for want of spirit: he feared alike <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran's</span> love of enterprize, and <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet's</span> fondness for retirement: he observed, in <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, a placid easiness of temper, which might suffer
the reins of government to lie too loose; and, in <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, a quickness of resentment, and jealousy of command, which
might hold them too tight: he hoped, therefore, that by leaving them a
joint dominion, he should blend their dispositions, at least in their
effects, in every act of government that should take place; or that,
however they should agree to administer their government, the public would
derive benefit from the virtues of both, without danger of suffering from
their imperfections, <!-- Page 30 --><a name="Page_30"></a>as their
imperfections would only operate against each other, while, in whatever
was right, their minds would naturally concur, as the coincidence of
rectitude with rectitude is necessary and eternal. But he did not
consider, that different dispositions operating separately upon two
different wills, would appear in effects very unlike those, which they
would concur to produce in one: that two wills, under the direction of
dispositions so different, would seldom be brought to coincide; and that
more mischiefs would probably arise from the contest, than from the
imperfections of either alone.</p>

<p>But Solyman had so long applauded himself for his project before he
revealed <!-- Page 31 --><a name="Page_31"></a>it to <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span>, that <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> found
him too much displeased with any objection, to consider its weight: and
knowing that peculiar notions are more rarely given up, than opinions
received from others, and made our own only by adoption, he at length
acquiesced, lest he should by farther opposition lose his influence, which
on other occasions he might still employ to the advantage of the public;
and took a solemn oath, that he would, as far as was in his power, see the
will carried into execution.</p>

<p>To this, indeed, he consented without much reluctance, as he had little
less reason to fear the sole government of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, than a joint administration; and if a struggle for
superiority <!-- Page 32 --><a name="Page_32"></a>should happen, he hoped
the virtues <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> would obtain the
suffrages of the people in his favour, and establish him upon the throne
alone. But as change is itself an evil, and as changes in government are
seldom produced without great confusion and calamity, he applied himself
to consider in what manner the government of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> could be
administered, so as most effectually to blend their characters in their
administration, and prevent the conduct of one from exciting jealousy in
the other.</p>

<p>After much thought, he determined that a system of laws should be
prepared, which the sons of Solyman should examine and alter till they
perfectly approved, and to which they <!-- Page 33 --><a name=
"Page_33"></a>should then give the sanction of their joint authority: that
when any addition or alteration should be thought necessary, it should be
made in the same manner; and that when any insuperable difference of
sentiment happened, either in this or in any act of prerogative
independent of the laws for regulating the manners of the people, the
kings should refer it to some person of approved integrity and wisdom, and
abide by his determination. <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> easily
foresaw, that when the opinion of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>
and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> should differ, the opinion of
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> would be established; for there
were many causes that would render <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>
inflexible, and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> yielding: <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was naturally confident and assuming,
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> diffident and modest;
<!-- Page 34 --><a name="Page_34"></a><span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> was impatient of contradiction, <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> was attentive to argument, and felicitous only
for the discovery of truth. <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> also
conceived, that by the will of his father, he had suffered wrong; <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, that he had received a favour: <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, therefore, was disposed to resent the
first appearance of opposition; and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
on the contrary, to acquiesce, as in his share of government, whatever it
might be, he had more than was his right by birth, and his brother had
less. Thus, therefore, the will of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>
would probably predominate in the state: but as the same cause which
conferred this superiority, would often prevent contention, <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span> considered <!-- Page 35 --><a name=
"Page_35"></a>it, upon the whole, rather as good than evil.</p>

<p>When he had prepared his plan, therefore, he sent a copy of it, by
different messengers at the same time, both to <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, inclosed in a
letter, in which he exprest his sense of obligation to their father, and
his zeal and affection for them: he mentioned the promise he had made, to
devote himself to their service; and the oath he had taken, to propose
whatever he thought might facilitate the accomplishment of their father's
design, with honour to them and happiness to their people: these motives,
which he could not resist without impiety, he hoped <!-- Page 36 --><a
name="Page_36"></a>would absolve him from presumption; and trusting in the
rectitude of his intentions, he left the issue to God.</p>

<p>The receipt of this letter threw <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>
into another agony of indignation: he felt again the loss of his
prerogative; the offer of advice he disdained as an insult, to which he
had been injuriously subjected by the will of his father; and he was
disposed to reject whatever was suggested by <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span>, even before his proposal was known. With this temper of mind
he began to read, and at every paragraph took new offence; he determined,
however, not to admit <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> to the honour of
a conference upon the subject, but to settle a plan of government with his
brother, without the least regard to his advice.</p>

<!-- Page 38 --><a name="Page_38"></a>

<p>A supercilious attention to minute formalities, is a certain indication
of a little mind, conscious to the want of innate dignity, and felicitous
to derive from others what it cannot supply to itself: as the scrupulous
exaction of every trifling tribute discovers the weakness of the tyrant,
who fears his claim should be disputed; while the prince, who is conscious
of superior and indisputable power, and knows that the states he has
subjugated do not dare to revolt, scarce enquires whether such testimonies
of allegiance are given or not.</p>

<p>Thus, the jealousy of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> already
enslaved him to the punctilios of state; and the most trifling
circumstances involved him in perplexity, <!-- Page 39 --><a name=
"Page_39"></a>or fired him with resentment: the friendship and fidelity of
<span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> stung him with rage, as insolent and
intrusive; and though it determined him to an immediate interview with his
brother, yet he was embarrassed how to procure it. At first he rose, and
was about to go to him; but he stopped short with disdain, upon
reflecting, that it was an act of condescension which might be deemed an
acknowledgement of superiority: he then thought of sending for <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> to come to him; but this he feared might
provoke him, as implying a denial of his equality: at length he determined
to propose a meeting in the chamber of council, and was just dispatching
an officer with the message, when <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>
entered the apartment.</p>

<!-- Page 40 --><a name="Page_40"></a>

<p>The countenance of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was flushed
with joy, and his heart was warmed with the pleasing sensations of
affection and confidence, by the same letter, from which <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> had extracted the bitterness of jealousy and
resentment, and as he had no idea that an act of courtesy to his brother
could derogate from his own dignity or importance, he indulged the honest
impatience of his heart to communicate the pleasure with which it
overflowed: he was, indeed, somewhat disappointed, to find no traces of
satisfaction in the countenance of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,
when he saw the same paper in his hand, which had impressed so much upon
his own.</p>

<!-- Page 41 --><a name="Page_41"></a>

<p>He waited some time after the first salutations, without mentioning the
scheme of government he was come to concert; because having observed that
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was embarrassed and displeased, he
expected that he would communicate the cause, and pleased himself with the
hope that he might remove it: finding, however, that this expectation was
disappointed, he addressed him to this effect:</p>

<p>'How happy are we, my dear brother, in the wisdom and fidelity, of
<span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>! how excellent is the system of
government that he has proposed! how easy and honourable will it be to us
that govern, and how advantageous to the people that obey!'</p>

<!-- Page 42 --><a name="Page_42"></a>

<p>'The advantages,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'which
you seem to have discovered, are not evident to me: tell me, then, what
you imagine they are, and I will afterwards give you my opinion.'</p>

<p>'By establishing a system of laws as the rule of government,' said
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, 'many evils will be avoided, and
many benefits procured. If the law is the will only of the sovereign, it
can never certainly be known to the people: many, therefore, may violate
that rule of right, which the hand of the Almighty has written upon the
living tablets of the heart, in the presumptuous hope, that it will not
subject them to punishment; and those, by whom that rule is fulfilled,
will <!-- Page 43 --><a name="Page_43"></a>not enjoy that consciousness of
security, which they would derive from the protection of a prescribed law,
which they have never broken. Neither will those who are inclined to do
evil, be equally restrained by the fear of punishment; if neither the
offence is ascertained, nor the punishment prescribed. One motive to
probity, therefore, will be wanting; which ought to be supplied, as well
for the sake of those who may be tempted to offend, as of those who may
suffer by the offence. Besides, he who governs not by a written and a
public law, must either administer that government in person, or by
others: if in person, he will sink under a labour which no man is able to
sustain; and if by others, the inferiority <!-- Page 44 --><a name=
"Page_44"></a>of their rank must subject them to temptations which it
cannot be hoped they will always resist, and to prejudices which it will
perhaps be impossible for them to surmount. But to administer government
by a law which ascertains the offence, and directs the punishment,
integrity alone will be sufficient; and as the perversion of justice will
in this case be notorious, and depend not upon opinion but fact, it will
seldom be practised, because it will be easily punished.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who had heard the opinions of
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> with impatience and scorn, now
started from his feat with a proud and contemptuous aspect: he first
glanced his eyes upon his brother; <!-- Page 45 --><a name=
"Page_45"></a>and then looking disdainfully downward, he threw back his
robe, and stretching out his hand from him, 'Shall the son of Solyman,'
said he, 'upon whose will the fate of nations was suspended, whose smiles
and frowns were alone the criterions of right and wrong, before whom the
voice of wisdom itself was silent, and the pride even of virtue humbled in
the dust; shall the son of Solyman be harnessed, like a mule, in the
trammels of law? shall he become a mere instrument to execute what others
have devised? shall he only declare the determinations of a statute, and
shall his ear be affronted by claims of right? It is the glory of a
prince, to punish for what and whom he will; to be the sovereign, not only
of property, <!-- Page 46 --><a name="Page_46"></a>but of life; and to
govern alike without prescription or appeal.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who was struck with astonishment
at this declaration, and the vehemence with which it was uttered, after a
short recollection made this reply: 'It is the glory of a prince, to
govern others, as he is governed by Him, who is alone most merciful and
almighty! It is his glory to prevent crimes, rather than to display his
power in punishment; to diffuse happiness, rather than inforce subjection;
and rather to animate with love, than depress by fear. Has not He that
shall judge us, given us a rule of life by which we shall be judged? is
not our reward and punishment already <!-- Page 47 --><a name=
"Page_47"></a>set before us? are not His promises and threatenings,
motives to obedience? and have we not confidence and joy, when we have
obeyed? To God, His own divine perfections are a law; and these He has
transcribed as a law to us. Let us, then, govern, as we are governed; let
us seek our happiness in the happiness that we bestow, and our honour in
emulating the benevolence of Heaven.'</p>

<p>As <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> feared, that to proceed
farther in this argument would too far disclose his sentiments, and put
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> too much upon his guard; he
determined for the present to dissemble: and as he perceived, that <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet's</span> opinion, and an administration founded
upon it, would render him extreamly popular, <!-- Page 48 --><a name=
"Page_48"></a>and at length possibly establish him alone; he was now
felicitous only to withdraw him from public notice, and persuade him to
leave the government, whatever form it should receive, to be administered
by others: returning, therefore, to his seat, and assuming an appearance
of complacence and tranquillity, with which he could not form his language
perfectly to agree; 'Let us then,' said he, 'if a law must be set up in
our stead, leave the law to be executed by our slaves: and as nothing will
be left for us to do, that is worthy of us, let us devote ourselves to the
pleasures of ease; and if there are any enjoyments peculiar to royalty,
let us secure them as our only distinction from the multitude.'</p>

<!-- Page 49 --><a name="Page_49"></a>

<p>'Not so,' says <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; 'for there is yet
much for a prince to do, after the best system of laws has been
established: the government of a nation as a whole, the regulation and
extent of its trade, the establishment of manufactories, the encouragement
of genius, the application of the revenues, and whatever can improve the
arts of peace, and secure superiority in war, is the proper object of a
king's attention.</p>

<p>'But in these,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'it will
be difficult for two minds to concur; let us, then, agree to leave these
also to the care of some other, whom we can continue as long as we
approve, and displace when we <!-- Page 50 --><a name=
"Page_50"></a>approve no longer: we shall, by this expedient, be able to
avert the odium of any unpopular measure; and by the sacrifice of a slave,
we can always satisfy the people, and silence public discontent.'</p>

<p>'To trust implicitly to another,' says <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, 'is to give up a prerogative, which is at once our highest
duty and interest to keep; it is to betray our trust, and to sacrifice our
honour to another. The prince, who leaves the government of his people
implicitly to a subject, leaves it to one, who has many more temptations
to betray their interest than himself: a vicegerent is in a subordinate
<!-- Page 51 --><a name="Page_51"></a>station; he has, therefore, much to
rear, and much to hope: he may also acquire the power of obtaining what he
hopes, and averting what he rears, at the public expence; he may stand in
need of dependents, and may be able no otherwise to procure them, than by
conniving at the fraud or the violence which they commit: he may receive,
in bribes, an equivalent for his share, as an individual, in the public
prosperity; for his interest is not essentially connected with that of the
state; he has a separate interest; but the interest of the state, and of
the king, are one: he may even be corrupted to betray the councils, and
give up the interests of the nation, to a foreign power; but this is
impossible to the king; for nothing <!-- Page 52 --><a name=
"Page_52"></a>equivalent to what he would give up, could be offered him.
But as a king has not equal temptations to do wrong, neither is he equally
exposed to opposition, when he does right: the measures of a substitute
are frequently opposed, merely from interest; because the leader of a
faction against him, hopes, that if he can remove him by popular clamour,
he shall succeed to his power; but it can be no man's interest to oppose
the measures of a king, if his measures are good, because no man can hope
to supplant him. Are not these the precepts of the Prophet, whose wisdom
was from above?'&mdash;"Let not the eye of expectation be raised to
another, for that which thyself only should bestow: suffer not thy own
<!-- Page 53 --><a name="Page_53"></a>shadow to obscure thee; nor be
content to derive that glory, which it is thy prerogative to impart."</p>

<p>'But is the prince,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,
always the wisest man in his dominions? Can we not find, in another,
abilities and experience, which we do not possess? and is it not the duty
of him who presides in the ship, to, place the helm in that hand which can
best steer it?'</p>

<p>'A prince,' said <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, 'who sincerely
intends the good of his people, can scarce fail to effect it; all the
wisdom of the nation will be at once turned to that object: whatever is
his principal aim, will be that of all who are admitted to his council;
for to concur <!-- Page 54 --><a name="Page_54"></a>with his principal
aim, must be the surest recommendation to his favour. Let us, then, hear
others; but let us act ourselves.'</p>

<p>As <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> now perceived, that the
longer this conversation continued, the more he should be embarrassed; he
put an end to it, by appearing to acquiesce in what <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> had proposed. <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> withdrew, charmed with the candour and flexibility which he
imagined he had discovered in his brother; and not without some exultation
in his own rhetoric, which, he supposed had gained no inconsiderable
victory. <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, in the mean time,
applauded himself for having thus far practised the arts of
<!-- Page 55 --><a name="Page_55"></a>dissimulation with success;
fortified himself in the resolutions he had before taken; and conceived
new malevolence and jealousy against <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>.</p>

<br />


<p>While <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was exulting in his
conquest, and his heart was overflowing at once with self-complacency, and
affection to his brother; he was told, that <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span> was waiting without, and desired admittance. <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> ordered that he should be immediately introduced;
and when <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> entered, and would have
prostrated himself before him, he catched him in his arms in a transport
of affection and esteem; and having ordered that none should interrupt
them, compelled him to sit down on a sofa.</p>

<p>He then related, with all the joy of a youthful and an ardent mind, the
<!-- Page 57 --><a name="Page_57"></a>conversation he had had with <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, intermixed with expressions of the
highest praise and the most cordial esteem. <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span> was not without suspicion, that the sentiments which <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had first expressed with such vehemence
of passion, were still predominant in his mind: but of these suspicions he
did not give the least hint to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; not
only because to communicate suspicions is to accuse without proof, but
because he did not think himself at liberty to make an ill report of
another, though he knew it to be true. He approved the sentiments of <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, as they had indeed been infused by his own
instructions; and some precepts and cautions were now added, which the
accession of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> <!-- Page 58 --><a name=
"Page_58"></a>to a share of the imperial power made particularly
necessary.</p>

<p>'Remember,' said <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'that the most
effectual way of promoting virtue, is to prevent occasions of vice. There
are, perhaps, particular situations, in which human virtue has always
failed: at least, temptation often repeated, and long continued, has
seldom been finally resisted. In a government so constituted as to leave
the people exposed to perpetual seduction, by opportunities of dissolute
pleasure or iniquitous gain, the multiplication of penal laws will only
tend to depopulate the kingdom, and disgrace the state; to devote to the
scymitar and the bow-string, those who might have been useful to society,
<!-- Page 59 --><a name="Page_59"></a>and to leave the rest dissolute
turbulent and factious. If the streets not only abound with women, who
inflame the passenger by their appearance, their gesture, and their
solicitations; but with houses, in which every desire which they kindle
may be gratified with secrecy and convenience; it is in vain that "the
feet of the prostitute go down to death, and that her steps take hold on
hell:" what then can be hoped from any punishment, which the laws of man
can superadd to disease and want, to rottenness and perdition? If you
permit opium to be publickly sold at a low rate; it will be folly to hope,
that the dread of punishment will render idleness and drunkenness
strangers to the poor. If a tax is so collected, <!-- Page 60 --><a name=
"Page_60"></a>as to leave opportunities to procure the commodity, without
paying it; the hope of gain will always surmount the fear of punishment.
If, when the veteran has served you at the risque of life, you withold his
hire; it will be in vain to threaten usury and extortion with imprisonment
and fines. If, in your armies, you suffer it to be any man's interest,
rather to preserve the life of a horse than a man; be assured, that your
own sword is drawn for your enemy: for there will always be some, in whom
interest is stronger than humanity and honour. Put no man's interest,
therefore, in the ballance against his duty; nor hope that good can often
be produced, but by preventing opportunities of evil.'</p>

<!-- Page 61 --><a name="Page_61"></a>

<p>To these precepts of <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> listened as to the instructions of a father; and
having promised to keep them as the treasure of life, he dismissed him
from his presence. The heart of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was
now expanded with the most pleasing expectations; but <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> was pining with solicitude, jealousy, and
distrust: he took every opportunity to avoid both <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; but <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> still retained his confidence, and <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span> his suspicions.</p>

<h2>CHAP. V.</h2>

<br />


<p>In the mean time, the system of government was established which had
been proposed by <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, and in which <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> concurred from principle, and <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> from policy. The views of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> terminated in the gratification of his own
appetites and passions; those of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, in
the discharge of his duty: <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
therefore, was indefatigable in the business of the state; and as his
sense of honour, and his love of the public, made this the employment of
his choice, it was to him the perpetual source of a generous and sublime
felicity. <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> <!-- Page 63 --><a name=
"Page_63"></a>also was equally diligent, but from another motive: he was
actuated, not by love of the public, but by jealousy of his brother; he
performed his task as the drudge of necessity, with reluctance and ill
will; so that to him it produced pain and anxiety, weariness and
impatience.</p>

<p>To atone for this waste of time, he determined to crowd all that
remained with delight: his gardens were an epitome of all nature, and on
his palace were exhausted all the treasures of art; his seraglio was
filled with beauties of every nation, and his table supplied with dainties
from the remotest corners of his dominions. In the songs that were
repeated in his presence, he listened <!-- Page 64 --><a name=
"Page_64"></a>at once to the voice of adulation and music; he breathed the
perfumes of Arabia, and he tasted the forbidden pleasure of wine. But as
every appetite is soon satiated by excess, his eagerness to accumulate
pleasure deprived him of enjoyment. Among the variety of beauty that
surrounded him, the passion, which, to be luxurious, must be delicate and
refined, was degraded to a mere instinct, and exhausted in endless
dissipation; the caress was unendeared by a consciousness of reciprocal
delight, and was immediately succeeded by indifference or disgust. By the
dainties that perpetually urged him to intemperance, that appetite, which
alone could make even dainties tasteful, was destroyed. The splendor of
his palace and the beauty of his gardens, <!-- Page 65 --><a name=
"Page_65"></a>became at length so familiar to his eye, that they were
frequently before him, without being seen. Even flattery and music lost
their power, by too frequent a repetition: and the broken slumbers of the
night, and the languor of the morning, were more than equivalent to the
transient hilarity that was inspired by wine. Thus passed the time of
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, divided between painful labours
which he did not dare to shun, and the search of pleasure which he could
never find.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, on the contrary, did not seek
pleasure, but pleasure seemed to seek him: he had a perpetual complacence
and serenity of mind, which rendered him constantly susceptible of
pleasing impressions; every thing that <!-- Page 66 --><a name=
"Page_66"></a>was prepared to refresh or entertain him in his seasons of
retirement and relaxation, added something to the delight which was
continually springing in his breast, when he reviewed the past, or looked
forward to the future. Thus, the pleasures of sense were heightened by
those of his mind, and the pleasures of the mind by those of sense: he
had, indeed, as yet no wise; for as yet no woman had fixed his attention,
or determined his choice.</p>

<p>Among the ambassadors whom the monarchs of Asia sent to congratulate
the sons of Solyman upon their accession to the throne, there was a native
of Circassia, whose name was Abdallah. Abdallah had only one child, a
daughter, in whom all his happiness and affection <!-- Page 67 --><a name=
"Page_67"></a>centered; he was unwilling to leave her behind, and
therefore brought her to the court of Persia. Her mother died while she
was yet an infant; she was now in the sixteenth year of her age, and her
name was <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>. She was beautiful as the
daughters of Paradise, and gentle as the breezes of the spring; her mind
was without stain, and her manners were without art.</p>

<p>She was lodged with her father in a palace that joined to the gardens
of the seraglio; and it happened that a lamp which had one night been left
burning in a lower apartment, by some accident set fire to the net-work of
cotton that surrounded a sopha, and the whole room was soon after in a
<!-- Page 68 --><a name="Page_68"></a>flame. <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, who had been passing the afternoon in riot and debauchery,
had been removed from his banquetting room asleep; but <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> was still in his closet, where he had been
regulating some papers that were to be used the next day. The windows of
this room opened towards the inner apartments of the house in which
Abdallah resided; and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, having by
accident looked that way, was alarmed by the appearance of an unusual
light, and starting up to see whence it proceeded, he discovered what had
happened.</p>

<p>Having hastily ordered the guard of the night to assist in quenching
the flame, and removing the furniture, he ran himself into the garden. As
<!-- Page 69 --><a name="Page_69"></a>soon as he was come up to the house,
he was alarmed by the shrieks of a female voice; and the next moment,
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> appeared at the window of an
apartment directly over that which was on fire. <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> he had till now never seen, nor did he so much as know that
Abdallah had a daughter: but though her person was unknown, he was
strongly interested in her danger, and called out to her to throw herself
into his arms. At the sound of his voice she ran back into the room, such
is the force of inviolate modesty, though the smoke was then rising in
curling spires from the windows: she was, however, soon driven back; and
part of the floor at the same instant giving way, she wrapt
<!-- Page 70 --><a name="Page_70"></a>her veil round her, and leaped into
the garden. <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> caught her in his arms;
but though he broke her fall, he sunk down with her weight: he did not,
however, quit his charge, but perceiving she had fainted, he made haste
with her into his apartment, to afford her such assistance as he could
procure.</p>

<p>She was covered only with the light and loose robe in which she slept,
and her veil had dropped off by the way. The moment he entered his closet,
the light discovered to him such beauty as before he had never seen: she
now began to revive; and before her senses returned, she pressed the
prince with an involuntary embrace, which he returned by straining her
closer to his <!-- Page 71 --><a name="Page_71"></a>breast, in a tumult of
delight, confusion, and anxiety, which he could scarce sustain. As he
still held her in his arms, and gazed silently upon her, she opened her
eyes, and instantly relinquishing her hold, shrieked out, and threw
herself from him. As there were no women nearer than that wing of the
palace in which his brother resided, and as he had many reasons not to
leave her in their charge; he was in the utmost perplexity what to do. He
assured her, in some hasty and incoherent words, of her security; he told
her, that she was in the royal palace, and that he who had conveyed her
thither was <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>. The habitual reverence
of sovereign power, now surmounted all other passions in the bosom of
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>: she was instantly
<!-- Page 72 --><a name="Page_72"></a>covered with new confusion; and
hiding her face with her hands, threw herself at his feet: he raised her
with a trepidation almost equal to her own, and endeavoured to sooth her
into confidence and tranquillity.</p>

<p>Hitherto her memory had been wholly suspended by violent passions,
which had crowded upon her in a rapid and uninterrupted succession, and
the first gleam of recollection threw her into a new agony; and having
been silent a few moments, she suddenly smote her hands together, and
bursting into tears, cried out, 'Abdallah! my father! my
father!'&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> not only knew but felt
all the meaning of the exclamation, and immediately ran again into the
garden: he had advanced <!-- Page 73 --><a name="Page_73"></a>but a few
paces, before he discerned an old man sitting upon the ground, and looking
upward in silent anguish, as if he had exhausted the power of complaint.
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, upon a nearer approach, perceived by
the light of the flame that it was Abdallah; and instantly calling him by
his name, told him, that his daughter was safe. At the name of his
daughter, Abdallah suddenly started up, as if he had been roused by the
voice of an angel from the sleep of death: <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> again repeated, that his daughter was in safety; and Abdallah
looking wistfully at him, knew him to be the king. He was then struck with
an awe that restrained him from enquiry: but <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> directing him where he might find her, went forward, that he
<!-- Page 74 --><a name="Page_74"></a>might not lessen the pleasure of
their interview, nor restrain the first transports of duty and affection
by his presence. He soon met with other fugitives from the fire, which had
opened a communication between the gardens and the street; and among them
some women belonging to <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, whom, he
conducted himself to their mistress. He immediately allotted to her and to
her father, an apartment in his division of the palace; and the fire being
now nearly extinguished, he retired to rest.</p>

<p>Though the night was far advanced, yet the eyes of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> were strangers to sleep: his fancy incessantly
repeated the events that had just happened; the image of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span> was ever before him; and his breast throbbed
with a disquietude, which, though it prevented rest, he did not wish to
lose.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, in the mean time, was
slumbering away the effects of his intemperance; and in the morning, when
he was told what had happened, he expressed no passion but curiosity: he
<!-- Page 76 --><a name="Page_76"></a>went hastily into the garden; but
when he had gazed upon the ruins, and enquired how the fire began, and
what it had consumed, he thought of it no more.</p>

<p>But <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> suffered nothing that regarded
himself, to exclude others from his attention: he went again to the ruins,
not to gratify his curiosity, but to see what might yet be done to
alleviate the misery of the sufferers, and secure for their use what had
been preserved from the flames. He found that no life had been lost, but
that many persons had been hurt; to these he sent the physicians of his
own houshold: and having rewarded those who had assisted them in their
distress, not forgetting even the soldiers who had only fulfilled his own
orders, he <!-- Page 77 --><a name="Page_77"></a>returned, and applied
himself to dispatch the public business in the chamber of council, with
the same patient and diligent attention as if nothing had happened. He
had, indeed, ordered enquiry to be made after <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>; and when he returned to his apartment, he found Abdallah
waiting to express his gratitude for the obligations he had received.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> accepted his acknowledgements with
a peculiar pleasure, for they had some connexion with <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>; after whom he again enquired, with an ardour
uncommon even to the benevolence of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>.
When all his questions had been asked and answered, he appeared still
unwilling to dismiss Abdallah, though he <!-- Page 78 --><a name=
"Page_78"></a>seemed at a loss how to detain him; he wanted to know,
whether his daughter had yet received an offer of marriage, though he was
unwilling to discover his desire by a direct enquiry: but he soon found,
that nothing could be known, which was not directly asked, from a man whom
reverence and humility kept silent before him, except when something was
said which amounted to a command to speak. At length, however, he said,
not without some hesitation, 'Is there no one, Abdallah, who will thank me
for the preservation of thy daughter, with a zeal equal to thy own?'
'Yes,' replied Abdallah, 'that daughter whom thou hast preserved.' This
reply, though it was unexpected was pleasing: for <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> was not only <!-- Page 79 --><a name="Page_79"></a>gratified
to hear, that <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> had expressed herself
warmly in his behalf, at least as a benefactor; but he judged, that if any
man had been interested in her life as a lover, the answer which Abdallah
had given him would not so readily have occurred to his mind.</p>

<p>As this reflection kept <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> a few
moments silent, Abdallah withdrew; and <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, as he observed some marks of haste and confusion in his
countenance, was unwilling longer to continue him in a situation, which he
had now reason to think gave him pain. But Abdallah, who had conceived a
sudden thought that <span class="smallcaps">Hamet's</span> question was an
indirect reproach of <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, for not
having herself solicited admission to his presence; went
<!-- Page 80 --><a name="Page_80"></a>in haste to her apartment, and
ordered her immediately to make ready to attend him to the king.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, from whose mind the image of
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> had not been absent a moment since
she first saw him, received this order with a mixture of pain and
pleasure; of wishes, hopes, and apprehensions, that filled her bosom with
emotion, and covered her face with blushes. She had not courage to ask the
reason of the command, which she instantly prepared to obey; but the
tenderness of Abdallah, who perceived and pitied her distress, anticipated
her wish. In a short time, therefore, he returned to the chamber of
presence, and having received permission, he entered with <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span> in his <!-- Page 81 --><a name=
"Page_81"></a>hand. <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> rose in haste to
receive her, with a glow of pleasure and impatience in his countenance;
and having raised her from the ground, supported her in his arms, waiting
to hear her voice; but though she made many attempts, she could not speak.
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who knew not to what he owed this
sudden and unexpected interview, which, though he wished, he could
contrive no means to obtain; imagined that <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> had some request, and therefore urged her tenderly to make
it: but as she still remained silent, he looked at Abdallah, as expecting
to hear it from him. 'We have no wish,' said Abdallah, 'but to atone for
our offence; nor any request, but that my lord would now accept the thanks
of <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> for the life <!-- Page 82 --><a
name="Page_82"></a>which he has preserved, and impute the delay, not to
ingratitude, but inadvertence: let me now take her back, as thy gift; and
let the light of thy favour be upon us.' 'Take her then,' said <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; 'for I would give her only to thee.'</p>

<p>These words of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> did not escape the
notice either of Abdallah or <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>; but
neither of them mentioned their conjectures to the other. <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>, who was inclined to judge of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet's</span> situation by her own, and who recollected many
little incidents, known only to herself, which favoured her wishes;
indulged the hope, that she should again hear of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, with more confidence than her father; nor were her
expectations <!-- Page 83 --><a name="Page_83"></a>disappointed. <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> reflected with pleasure, that he had
prepared the way for a more explicit declaration; and as his impatience
increased with his passion every hour, he sent for Abdallah the next
morning, and told him, that he wished to be more acquainted with his
daughter, with a view to make her his wife: 'As neither you nor your
daughter are my subjects,' says <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, 'I
cannot command you; and if you were, upon this occasion I would not. I do
not want a slave, but a friend; not merely a woman, but a wife. If I find
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> such as my fancy has feigned her;
if her mind corresponds with her form; and if I have reason to think, that
she can give her heart to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, and not
merely her hand to the <!-- Page 84 --><a name="Page_84"></a>king; I shall
be happy.' To this declaration, Abdallah replied with expressions of the
profoundest submission and gratitude; and <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> dismissed him, to prepare <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> to receive him in the afternoon of the same day.</p>

<p>As eight moons only had passed since the death of Solyman, and as the
reverence of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> for the memory of his
father would not suffer him to marry till the year should be completed; he
determined not to mention <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> to his
brother, till the time when he could marry her was near. The fierce and
haughty deportment of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had now left
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> no room to doubt of his character:
and though he had no apprehension that he would make any attempts upon
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, after she should be his wife; yet
he did not know how much might justly be feared from his passion,
<!-- Page 86 --><a name="Page_86"></a>if he should see her and become
enamoured of her, while she was yet a virgin in the house of her
father.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> had not only unsullied purity of
mind, but principles of refined and exalted virtue; and as the life of
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was an example of all that was either
great or good, Abdallah felt no anxiety upon leaving them together, except
what arose from his fears, that his daughter would not be able to secure
the conquest she had made.</p>

<p>As it was impossible for <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> to have
such an acquaintance with <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> as he
desired, till he could enter into conversation with her upon terms of
equality; it was his first care to sooth her into confidence and
familiarity, <!-- Page 87 --><a name="Page_87"></a>and by degrees he
succeeded: he soon found, in the free intercourse of mind with mind, which
he established instead of the implicit submission which only ecchoed his
own voice, how little of the pleasure that women were formed to give can
be enjoyed, when they are considered merely as slaves to a tyrant's will,
the passive subjects of transient dalliance and casual enjoyment. The
pleasure which he took in the youthful beauty of <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>, was now endeared, exalted, and refined, by the tender
sensibility of her heart, and by the reflexion of his own felicity from
her eyes: when he admired the gracefulness of her motion, the elegance of
her figure, the symmetry of her features, and the bloom of her complexion,
he considered them as the decorations only <!-- Page 88 --><a name=
"Page_88"></a>of a mind, capable of mixing with his own in the most
exquisite delight, of reciprocating all his ideas, and catching new
pleasure from his pleasure. Desire was no longer appetite; it was
imagination, it was reason; it included remembrance of the past, and
anticipation of the future; and its object was not the sex, but <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>.</p>

<p>As <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> never witheld any pleasure that
it was in his power to impart, he soon acquainted Abdallah, that he waited
only for a proper time to place <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>
upon the throne; but that he had some reasons for keeping a resolution,
which he thought himself obliged to communicate to him, concealed from
others.</p>

<!-- Page 89 --><a name="Page_89"></a>

<p>It happened, however, that some of the women who attended upon <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, met with some female slaves belonging to
the seraglio of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, at the public
baths, and related to them all the particulars of <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida's</span> preservation by <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>;
that he had first conveyed her to his own apartments, and had since been
frequently with her in that which he had assigned her in his palace: they
were also lavish in the praise of her beauty, and free in their
conjectures what might be the issue of her intercourse with <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>.</p>

<p>Thus the situation of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> became the subject of conversation in the
seraglio of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who learnt it himself
in a short time from one of his women.</p>

<!-- Page 90 --><a name="Page_90"></a>

<p>He had hitherto professed great affection for <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was deceived by his
professions: for notwithstanding the irregularities of his life, he did
not think him capable of concealed malice; or of offering injury to
another, except when he was urged by impetuous passions to immediate
pleasure. As there was, therefore, an appearance of mutual affection
between them, <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, though the report of
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida's</span> beauty had fired his imagination
and fixed him in a resolution to see her, did not think proper to attempt
it without asking <span class="smallcaps">Hamet's</span> consent, and
being introduced by his order; as he made no doubt of there being a
connexion between them which would make him resent a contrary conduct.</p>

<!-- Page 91 --><a name="Page_91"></a>

<p>He took an opportunity, therefore, when they were alone in a summer
pavilion that was built on a lake behind the palace, to reproach him, with
an air of mirth, for having concealed a beauty near his apartments, though
he pretended to have no seraglio. <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>
instantly discovered his surprize and emotion by a blush, which the next
moment left his countenance paler than the light clouds that pass by night
over the moon. <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> took no notice of
his confusion; but that he might more effectually conceal his sentiments
and prevent suspicion, he suddenly adverted to another subject, while
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was hesitating what to reply. By this
artifice <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was deceived; and concluded,
that whatever <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had heard of <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, had passed slightly <!-- Page 92 --><a
name="Page_92"></a>over his mind, and was remembered but by chance; he,
therefore, quickly recovered that ease and chearfulness, which always
distinguished his conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> observing the success of his
artifice, soon after, as if by a sudden and casual recollection, again
mentioned the lady; and told him, he would congratulate Abdallah upon
having resigned her to his bed. As <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>
could not bear to think of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran's</span>
mentioning <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> to her father as his
mistress, he replied, that he had no such intimacy with <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span> as he supposed; and that he had so high an
opinion of her virtue, as to believe, that if he should propose it she
would not consent. The imagination of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> <!-- Page 93 --><a name="Page_93"></a>caught new fire from
beauties which he found were yet unenjoyed, and virtue which stamped them
with superior value by rendering them more difficult of access; and as
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> had renounced a connection with her
as a mistress, he wanted only to know whether he intended her for a
wife.</p>

<p>This secret he was contriving to discover, when <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, having reflected, that if he concealed this
particular, <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> might think himself at
liberty to make what attempts he should think fit upon <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>, without being accountable to him, or giving
him just cause of offence, put an end to his doubts, by telling him, he
had such a design; but that it would be some time before he should carry
it into execution. <!-- Page 94 --><a name="Page_94"></a>This declaration
increased <span class="smallcaps">Almoran's</span> impatience: still,
however, he concealed his interest in the conversation, which he now
suffered to drop.</p>

<p>He parted from his brother, without any farther mention of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span> but while he was yet near him, turned hastily
back, and, as if merely to gratify his curiosity, told him with a smile,
that he must indulge him with a fight of his Circassian; and desired he
might accompany him in his next visit, or at some more convenient time:
with this request, <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, as he knew, not
how to refuse it, complied; but it filled his mind with anxiety and
trouble.</p>

<p>He went immediately to <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, and told
her all that had happened; <!-- Page 95 --><a name="Page_95"></a>and as
she saw that he was net without apprehensions of mischief from his
brother's visit, she gently reproached him for doubting the fidelity of
her affection, as she supposed no power could be exerted by <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> to injure him, who in power was his equal.
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, in a transport of tenderness,
assured her that he doubted neither her constancy nor her love: but as to
interrupt the comfort of her mind, would only double his own distress, he
did not tell her whence his apprehensions proceeded; nor indeed had they
any determinate object, but arose in general from the character of his
brother, and the probability of his becoming a competitor, for what was
essential to the happiness of his life.</p>

<!-- Page 96 --><a name="Page_96"></a>

<p>But if the happiness of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was
lessened, the infelicity of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was
increased. All the enjoyments that were in his power he neglected, his
attention being wholly fixed upon that which was beyond his reach; he was
impatient to see the beauty, who had taken intire possession of his mind;
and the probability that he would be obliged to resign her to <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, tormented him with jealousy, envy, and
indignation.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, however, did not long delay to
fulfil his promise to his brother; but having prepared <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span> to receive him, he conducted him to her
apartment. The idea which <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had
formed in his imagination, was exceeded by the reality, and his passion
<!-- Page 97 --><a name="Page_97"></a>was proportionably increased; yet he
found means not only to conceal it from <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, but from <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, by
affecting an air of levity and merriment, which is not less incompatible
with the pleasures than the pains of love. After they had been regaled
with coffee and sherbet, they parted; and <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> congratulated himself, that his apprehensions of finding in
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> a rival for <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida's</span> love, were now at an end.</p>

<p>But <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, whose passions were become
more violent by restraint, was in a state of mind little better than
distraction: one moment he determined to seize upon the person of <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> in the night, and secrete her in some
place accessible only to himself; and <!-- Page 98 --><a name=
"Page_98"></a>the next to assassinate his brother, that he might at once
destroy a rival both in empire and in love. But these designs were no
sooner formed by his wishes, than they were rejected by his fears: he was
not ignorant, that in any contest between him and <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, the voice of the public would be against him; especially in
a contest, in which it would appear, that <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> had suffered wrong.</p>

<p>Many other projects, equally rash, violent, and injurious, were by
turns conceived and rejected: and he came at last to no other
determination, than still carefully to conceal his passion, till he should
think of some expedient to gratify it; lest <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> should have a <!-- Page 99 --><a name="Page_99"></a>just
reason for refusing to let him see the lady again, and remove her to some
place which he might never be able to discover.</p>

<h2>CHAP. VIII.</h2>

<br />


<p>In the mean time, <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, to whom <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> had from time to time disclosed the
minutest particulars of his situation and design, kept his eye almost
continually upon <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>; and observed him
with an attention and sagacity, which it was difficult either to elude or
deceive. He perceived, that he was more than usual restless and turbulent;
that in the presence of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> he frequently
changed countenance; that his behaviour was artificial and inconsistent,
frequently shifting from gloomy discontent and furious agitation, to
forced laughter and noisy <!-- Page 101 --><a name=
"Page_101"></a>merriment. He had also remarked, that he seemed most
discomposed after he had been with <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> to
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, which happened generally once in a
week; that he was become fond of solitude, and was absent several days
together from the apartment of his women.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, who from this conduct of <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had begun to suspect his principles,
determined to introduce such topics of discourse, as might lead him to
discover the state of his mind; and enable him to enforce and confirm the
principles he had taught him, by new proofs and illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who, since the death of his
father, had nothing to apprehend <!-- Page 102 --><a name=
"Page_102"></a>from the discovery of sentiments which before he had been
careful to conceal; now urged his objections against religion, when <span
class="smallcaps">Omar</span> gave him opportunity, without reserve. 'You
tell me,' says he, 'of beings that are immortal, because they are
immaterial; beings which do not consist of parts, and which, therefore,
can admit no solution, the only natural cause of corruption and decay: but
that which is not material, can have no extension; and what has no
extension, possesses no space; and of such beings, the mind itself, which
you pretend to be such a being, has no conception.'</p>

<p>'If the mind,' says <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'can perceive
that there is in itself any <!-- Page 103 --><a name=
"Page_103"></a>single, property of such a being, it has irrefragable
evidence that it is such a being; though its mode of existence, as
distinct from matter, cannot now be comprehended.' 'And what property of
such a being,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'does the mind
of man perceive in itself?' 'That of <i>acting</i>, said <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'without <i>motion</i>. You have no idea, that a
material substance can act, but in proportion as it moves: yet to <i>
think</i>, is to <i>act</i>; and with the idea of thinking, the idea of
motion is never connected: on the contrary, we always conceive the mind to
be fixed, in proportion to the degree of ardour and intenseness with which
the power of thinking is exerted. Now, if that which is material cannot
act without motion; and if man is <!-- Page 104 --><a name=
"Page_104"></a>conscious, that to think, is to act and not to move; it
follows, that there is, in man, somewhat that is not matter; somewhat that
has no extension, and that possesses no space; somewhat which, having no
contexture or parts that can be dissolved or separated, is exempted from
all the natural causes of decay.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> paused; and <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> having stood some moments without reply, he
seized this opportunity to impress him with an awful sense of the power
and presence of the Supreme and Eternal Being, from whom his own existence
was derived: 'Let us remember,' said he, 'that to every act of this
immaterial and immortal part, the Father of spirits, from whom it
<!-- Page 105 --><a name="Page_105"></a>proceeds, is present: when I
behold the busy multitudes that crowd the metropolis of Persia, in the
persuit of business and projects infinitely complicated and various; and
consider that every idea which passes over their minds, every conclusion,
and every purpose, with all that they remember of the past, and all that
they imagine of the future, is at once known to the Almighty, who without
labour or confusion weighs every thought of every mind in His balance, and
reserves it to the day of retribution; my follies cover me with confusion,
and my soul is humbled in the dust.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, though he appeared to listen
with attention, and offered nothing <!-- Page 106 --><a name=
"Page_106"></a>against the reasoning of <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span>, yet secretly despised it as sophistry; which cunning only had
rendered specious; and which he was unable to confute, merely because it
was subtil, and not because it was true: he had been led, by his passions,
first to love, and then to adopt different opinions; and as every man is
inclined to judge of others by himself, he doubted, whether the principles
which <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> had thus laboured to establish;
were believed even by <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> himself.</p>

<p>Thus was the mind of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> to the
instructions of <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, as a rock slightly
covered with earth, is to the waters of heaven: the craggs are left bare
by the rain that washes them; and the same showers that fertilize the
field <!-- Page 107 --><a name="Page_107"></a>can only discover the
sterility of the rock.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, however, did not yet disclose his
suspicions to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, because he did not yet
see that it could answer any purpose. To remove <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> from her apartment, would be to shew a distrust, for which
there would not appear to be any cause; and to refuse <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> access to her when he desired it, might
precipitate such measures as he might meditate, and engage him in some
desperate attempt: he, therefore, contented himself with advising <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, to conceal the time of his marriage till
the evening before he intended it should take place, without assigning the
reason on which his advice was founded.</p>

<!-- Page 108 --><a name="Page_108"></a>

<p>To the council of <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> was implicitly obedient, as to the revelations of
the Prophet; but, like his instructions, it was neglected by <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who became every moment more wretched. He had
a graceful person, and a vigorous mind; he was in the bloom of youth, and
had a constitution that promised him length of days; he had power which
princes were emulous to obey, and wealth by which whatever could
administer to luxury might be bought, for every passion, and every
appetite, it was easy for him to procure a perpetual succession of new
objects: yet was <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, not only without
enjoyment, but without peace; he was by turns pining with discontent, and
raving with indignation; his vices had extracted <!-- Page 109 --><a name=
"Page_109"></a>bitter from every sweet; and having exhausted nature for
delight in vain, he was repining at the bounds in which he was confined,
and regretting the want of other powers as the cause of his misery.</p>

<p>Thus the year of mourning for Solyman was compleated, without any act
of violence on the part of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, or of
caution on the part of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>: but on the
evening of the last day, <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, having
secretly prepared every thing for performing the solemnity in a private
manner, acquainted <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> by a letter,
which <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, undertook to deliver, that he
should celebrate his marriage on the morrow. <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, who never doubted but he should have notice of this
<!-- Page 110 --><a name="Page_110"></a>event much longer before it was to
happen, read the letter with a perturbation that it was impossible to
conceal: he was alone in his private apartment, and taking his eye hastily
from the paper, he crushed it together in his hand, and thrusting it into
his bosom, turned from <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> without
speaking; and <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, thinking himself
dismissed, withdrew.</p>

<p>The passions which <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> could no
longer suppress, now burst out, in a torrent of exclamation: 'Am I then,
said he, 'blasted for ever with a double curse, divided empire and
disappointed love! What is dominion, if it is not possessed alone? and
what is power, which the dread of rival power perpetually controuls? Is it
for <!-- Page 111 --><a name="Page_111"></a>me to listen in silence to the
wrangling of slaves, that I may at last apportion to them what, with a
clamorous insolence, they demand as their due! as well may the sun linger
in his course, and the world mourn in darkness for the day, that the
glow-worm may still be seen to glimmer upon, the earth, and the owls and
bats that haunt the sepulchres of the dead enjoy a longer night. Yet this
have I done, because this has been done by <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>: and my heart sickens in vain with the desire of beauty,
because my power extends not to <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>.
With dominion undivided and <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, I
should be <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>; but without them, I am
less than nothing.'</p>

<!-- Page 112 --><a name="Page_112"></a>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, who, before he has passed the
pavilion, heard a sound which he knew to be the voice of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, returned hastily to the chamber in which he
left him, believing he had withdrawn too soon, and that the king, as he
knew no other was present, was speaking to him: he soon drew near enough
to hear what was said; and while he was standing torpid in suspense,
dreading to be discovered, and not knowing how to retire, <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> turned about.</p>

<p>At first, both stood motionless with confusion and amazement; bus <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran's</span> pride soon surmounted his other
passions, and his disdain of <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> gave his
guilt the firmness of virtue.</p>

<!-- Page 113 --><a name="Page_113"></a>

<p>'It is true,' said he, 'that thou hast stolen the secret of my heart;
but do not think, that I fear it should be known: though my poignard could
take it back with thy life; I leave it with thee. To reproach, or curse
thee, would do thee honour, and lift thee into an importance which
otherwise thou canst never reach.' <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>
then turned from him with a contemptuous frown: but <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span> caught him by the robe; and prostrating himself
upon the ground, intreated to be heard. His importunity at length
prevailed; and he attempted to exculpate himself, from the charge of
having insiduously intruded upon the privacy of his prince, but <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> sternly interrupted him: 'And what art
thou,' said he, 'that I <!-- Page 114 --><a name="Page_114"></a>should
care, whether thou art innocent or guilty?' 'If not for my sake,' said
<span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'listen for thy own; and though my
duty is despised, let my affection be heard. That thou art not happy, I
know; and I now know the cause. Let my lord pardon the presumption of his
slave: he that seeks to satisfy all his wishes, must be wretched; he only
can be happy, by whom some are suppressed.' At these words <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> snatched his robe from the hand of <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span>, and spurned him in a transport of rage and
indignation: 'The suppression of desire,' said he, 'is such happiness, as
that of the deaf who do not remember to have heard. If it is virtue, know,
that, as virtue, I despise it; for though it may secure
<!-- Page 115 --><a name="Page_115"></a>the obedience of the slave, it can
only degrade the prerogative of a prince. I cast off all restraint, as I
do thee: begone, therefore, to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, and
see me no more.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> obeyed without reply; and <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> being again alone, the conflict in his
mind was renewed with greater violence than before. He felt all that he
had disguised to <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, with the keenest
sensibility; and anticipated the effects of his detection, with
unutterable anguish and regret. He walked backward and forward with a
hasty but interrupted pace; sometimes stopping short, and pressing his
hand hard upon his brow; and sometimes by violent gestures showing the
agitation of his mind: he sometimes <!-- Page 116 --><a name=
"Page_116"></a>stood silent with his eyes, fixed upon, the ground, and his
arms folded together; and sometimes a sudden agony of thought forced him
into loud and tumultuous exclamations: he cursed the impotence of mind
that had suffered his thoughts to escape from him unawares; without
reflecting that he was even then repeating the folly; and while he felt
himself the victim of vice, he could not suppress his contempt of virtue:
'If I must perish,' said he, 'I will at least perish unsubdued: I will
quench no wish that nature kindles in my bosom; nor shall my lips utter
any prayer, but for new powers to feed the flame.'</p>

<p>As he uttered this expression, he felt the palace shake; he heard a
rushing, <!-- Page 117 --><a name="Page_117"></a>like a blast in the
desart; and a being of more than human appearance stood before him. <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, though he was terrified, was not
humbled; and he stood expecting the event, whether evil or good, rather
with obduracy than courage.</p>

<p>'Thou seest,' says the Appearance, 'a Genius, whom the daring purpose
of thy mind has convoked from the middle region, where he was appointed to
wait the signal; and who is now permitted to act in concert with thy will.
Is not this the language of thy heart?&mdash;"Whatever pleasure I can
snatch from the hand of time, as he passes by me, I will secure for
myself: my passions shall be strong, that my enjoyments may be
<!-- Page 118 --><a name="Page_118"></a>great; for what is the portion
allotted to man, but the joyful madness that prolongs the hours of
festivity, the fierce delight that is extorted from injury by revenge, and
the sweet succession of varied pleasures which the wish that is ever
changing prepares for love?"'</p>

<p>'Whatever thou art,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,
'whose voice has thus disclosed the secret of my soul, accept my homage;
for I will worship thee: and be thou henceforth my wisdom and my
strength.'</p>

<p>'Arise,' said the Genius, 'for therefore am I sent. To thy own powers,
mine shall be superadded: and if, as weak only, thou hast been wretched;
<!-- Page 119 --><a name="Page_119"></a>henceforth thou shalt be happy.
Take no thought for to-morrow; to-morrow, my power shall be employed in
thy behalf. Be not affrighted at any prodigy; but put thy confidence in
me.' While he was yet speaking and the eyes of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> were fixed upon him, a cloud gathered round him; and the
next moment dissolving again into air, he disappeared.</p>

<br />


<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, when he recovered from his
astonishment, and had reflected upon the prodigy, determined to wait the
issue, and refer all his hopes to the interposition of the Genius, without
attempting any thing to retard the marriage; at which he resolved to be
present, that he might improve any supernatural event which might be
produced in his favour.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, in the mean time, was
anticipating the morrow with a mixture of anxiety and pleasure; and though
he had no reason to think any thing <!-- Page 121 --><a name=
"Page_121"></a>could prevent his marriage, yet he wished it was over, with
an impatience that was considerably increased by fear.</p>

<p>Though the anticipation of the great event that was now so near, kept
him waking the greatest part of the night, yet he rose early in the
morning; and while he waited till <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>
should be ready to see him, he was told that <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span> was without, and desired admittance. When he came in, <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who always watched his countenance as a
mariner the stars of heaven, perceived that it was obscured with
perplexity and grief. 'Tell me,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, 'whence is the sorrow that I discover in thy face?' 'I am
sorrowful,' said <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'not for myself, but
for thee.' At these words <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> stept
backward, <!-- Page 122 --><a name="Page_122"></a>and fixed his eyes upon
<span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, without power to speak. 'Consider,
said <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'that thou art not a man only,
but a prince: consider also, that immortality is before thee; and that thy
felicity, during the endless ages of immortality, depends upon thyself:
fear not, therefore, what thou canst suffer from others; the evil and the
good of life are transient as the morning dew, and over these only the
hand of others can prevail.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, whose attachment to life was
strong, and whose expectations of immediate enjoyment were high, did not
feel the force of what <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> had said,
though he assented to its truth. 'Tell me,' said he, 'at once, what thou
fearest for me; deliver me from <!-- Page 123 --><a name=
"Page_123"></a>the torments of suspense, and trust my own fortitude to
save me from despair.' 'Know then,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span>, 'that thou art hated by <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, and that he loves <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>.'
At this declaration, the astonishment of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> was equal to his concern; and he was in doubt whether to
believe or disbelieve what he heard: but the moment he recollected the
wisdom and integrity of <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, his doubts
were at an end; and having recovered from his surprize, he was about to
make such enquiries as might gratify the anxious and tumultuous curiosity
which was excited in his breast, when <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>,
lifting up his hand, and beginning again to speak, <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> remained silent.</p>

<!-- Page 124 --><a name="Page_124"></a>

<p>'Thou knowest,' said <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'that when my
checks were yet ruddy with youth, and my limbs were braced by vigour, that
mine eye was guided to knowledge by the lamp that is kindled at midnight,
and much of what is hidden in the innermost recesses of nature, was
discovered to me: my prayer ascended in secret to Him, with whom there is
wisdom from everlasting to everlasting, and He illuminated my darkness
with His light. I know, by such sensations as the world either feels not
at all, or feels unnoticed without knowledge of their use, when the powers
that are invisible are permitted to mingle in the walks of men; and well I
know, that some being, who is more than mortal, has joined with <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> <!-- Page 125 --><a name=
"Page_125"></a>against thee, since the veil of night was last spread upon
the earth.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, whose blood was chilled with
horror, and whose nerves were no longer obedient to his will, after
several ineffectual attempts to speak, looked up at <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span>; and striking his hand upon his breast, cried out,
in an earnest, but faultering voice, 'What shall I do?' 'Thou must do,'
said <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'that which is RIGHT. Let not
thy foot be drawn by any allurement, or driven by any terror, from the
path of virtue. While thou art there, thou art in safety: and though the
world should unite against thee, by the united world thou canst not be
hurt.'</p>

<!-- Page 126 --><a name="Page_126"></a>

<p>'But what friendly power,' said <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
'shall guard even the path of virtue from grief and pain; from the silent
shaft of disappointed love, or the sounding scourge of outrageous
jealousy? These, surely, have overtaken the foot of perseverance; and by
these, though I should persevere, may my feet be overtaken.' 'What thou
sayest,' replied <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'is true; and it is
true also, that the tempest which roots up the forest, is driven over the
mountain with unabated rage: but from the mountain, what can it take more
than the vegetable dust, which the hand of nature has scattered upon the
moss that covers it? As the dust is to the mountain, so is all that the
storms of life can take from virtue, to the <!-- Page 127 --><a name=
"Page_127"></a>sum of good which the Omnipotent has appointed for its
reward.' <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, whose eye now expressed a
kind of doubtful confidence, a hope that was repressed by fear, remained
still silent; and <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, perceiving the
state of his mind, proceeded to fortify it by new precepts: 'If heaven,'
said he, 'should vanish like a vapour, and this firm orb of earth should
crumble into dust, the virtuous mind would stand unmoved amidst the ruins
of nature: for He, who has appointed the heavens and the earth to fail,
has said to virtue, "Fear not; for thou canst neither perish, nor be
wretched." Call up thy strength, therefore, to the fight in which thou art
sure of conquest: do thou only <!-- Page 128 --><a name=
"Page_128"></a>that which is RIGHT, and leave the event to Heaven.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, in this conference with <span
class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, having gradually recovered his fortitude;
and the time being now near, when he was to conduct <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span> to the court of the palace, where the marriage
ceremony was to be performed; they parted with mutual benedictions, each
recommending the other to the protection of the Most High.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour, the princes of the court being assembled, the
mufti and the imans being ready, and <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> seated upon his throne; <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> came forward, and
were placed one on the right hand, <!-- Page 129 --><a name=
"Page_129"></a>and the other on the left. The mufti was then advancing, to
hear and to record the mutual promise which was to unite them; <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was execrating the appearance of the
Genius, as a delusive dream, in all the tumults of anguish and despair;
and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> began to hope, that the
suspicions of <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> had been ill founded;
when a stroke of thunder shook the palace to its foundations, and a cloud
rose from the ground, like a thick smoke, between <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who was inspired with new
confidence and hope, by that which had struck the rest of the assembly
with terror, started from his seat with an ardent and furious look; and at
the same moment, a voice, that issued from <!-- Page 130 --><a name=
"Page_130"></a>the cloud, pronounced with a loud but hollow tone,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Fate has decreed, to <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>.'</span><br />


<p>At these words, <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> rushed forward,
and placing himself by the side of <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>,
the cloud disappeared; and he cried out, 'Let me now proclaim to the world
the secret, which to this moment I have hidden in my bosom: I love <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>. The being who alone knew my love, has
now by miracle approved it. Let his decree be accomplished.' He then
commanded that the ceremony should proceed; and seizing the hand of the
lady, began to repeat that part of it which was to have been repeated by
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>. But <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> instantly drew her hand from him in an agony of distress;
<!-- Page 131 --><a name="Page_131"></a>and <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, who till then had stood motionless with amazement and
horror, started from his trance, and springing forward rushed between
them. <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> turned fiercely upon him; but
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who having been warned by <span
class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, knew the prodigy to be effected by some
evil being whom it was virtue to resist, laid his hand upon his scymitar,
and, with a frown of indignation and defiance, commanded him to stand off:
'I now know thee,' said he, 'as a man; and, therefore, as a brother I know
thee not.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> reflecting, that the foundation
of this reproach was unknown to all who were present, and that to them he
would therefore appear to be injured; looked round with an affected
<!-- Page 132 --><a name="Page_132"></a>smile of wonder and compassion, as
appealing to them from a charge that was thus fiercely and injuriously
brought against him, and imputing it to the violence of sudden passions by
which truth and reason were overborne. The eye of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> at once detected the artifice, which he disdained to expose;
he, therefore, commanded the guard that attended to carry off <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span> to her apartment. The guard was preparing to
obey, when <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who thought he had now
such an opportunity to get her into his own power as would never return,
ordered them to see her safely lodged in his own seraglio.</p>

<p>The men, who thus received opposite commands from persons to whom
<!-- Page 133 --><a name="Page_133"></a>they owed equal obedience, stood
still in suspense, not knowing which to prefer: <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> then reproached them with want of obedience, not to him,
but to God, appealing to the prodigy for the justification of his claim.
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, on the contrary, repeated his order,
with a look and emphasis scarce less commanding than the thunder and the
voice. But the priests interposing in favour of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, upon presumption that his right had been decided by a
superior power; the guard rushed between <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, and with looks
that expressed the utmost reluctance and regret, attempted to separate
their hands, which were clasped in each other. She was affrighted at the
violence, but yet more at the apprehension of what was to
<!-- Page 134 --><a name="Page_134"></a>follow; she, therefore, turned her
eyes upon <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, conjuring him not to leave
her, in a tone of tenderness and distress which it is impossible to
describe: he replied with a vehemence that was worthy of his passion, 'I
will not leave thee,' and immediately drew his sabre. At the same moment
they forced her from him; and a party having interposed to cover those
that were carrying her off, <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> lifted up
his weapon to force his passage through them; but was prevented by <span
class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, who, having pressed through the crowd,
presented himself before him. 'Stop me not,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, 'it is for <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>.' 'If thou
wouldst save <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>,' said <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'and thyself, do that only which is RIGHT. What
have these done who oppose thee, <!-- Page 135 --><a name=
"Page_135"></a>more than they ought? and what end can their destruction
answer, but to stain thy hands with unavailing murder? Thou canst only
take the life of a few faithful slaves, who will not lift up their hands
against thee: thou canst not rescue <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>
from thy brother; but thou canst preserve thyself from guilt.'</p>

<p>These words of <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> suspended the rage
of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, like a charm; and returning his
scymitar into its sheath, 'Let me then,' said he, 'suffer, and be
guiltless. It is true, that against these ranks my single arm must be
ineffectual; but if my wrongs can rouse a nation to repress the tyranny,
that will shortly extend over it the injuries that now reach
<!-- Page 136 --><a name="Page_136"></a>only to me, justice shall be done
to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>.' Then turning to <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'Henceforth,' said he, 'the kingdom shall be
mine or thine. To govern in concert with thee, is to associate with the
powers of hell. The beings that are superior to evil, are the friends of
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; and if these are thy enemies, what
shall be thy defence?' <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> replied only
by a contemptuous smile; and the assembly being dismissed he retired to
his apartment: and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> and <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span> went out to the people, who had gathered in an
incredible multitude about the palace.</p>

<p>A rumour of what had happened within had reached them, which some
believed, and some doubted: but when they saw <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> return together, and
observed that their looks were full of resentment and trouble, they became
silent with attention in a moment; which <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span> observing, addressed them with an eloquence of which they had
often acknowledged the force, and of which they never repented the
effect.</p>

<p>He told them the tender connexion between <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, and
<!-- Page 138 --><a name="Page_138"></a>disclosed the subtil hypocrisy of
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>: he expatiated upon the folly of
supposing, that the power that was supreme in goodness and truth, should
command a violation of vows that had been mutually interchanged, and often
repeated; and devote to <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> the
beauties, which could only be voluntarily surrendered to <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>. They heard him with a vacant countenance of
surprize and wonder; and while he waited for their reply, they agreed
among themselves, that no man could avoid the destiny that was written
upon his head; and that if <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> had thus
been taken from <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, and given to <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, it was an event that by an unchangeable
decree was appointed to happen; and that, therefore, it was their duty to
acquiesce. <!-- Page 139 --><a name="Page_139"></a><span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span> then beckoned with his hand for audience a second
time, and told them, that <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had not
only practised the arts of sorcery to deprive <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> of <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, but that he
meditated a design to usurp the sole dominion, and deprive him of the
share of the government to which he had a right by the will of Solyman his
father. This also they heard with the same sentiments of wonder and
acquiescence: If it is decreed, said they, that <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> shall be king alone, who can prevent it? and if it is not,
who can bring it to pass? 'But know ye not,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span>, 'that when the end is appointed, the means are appointed
also. If it is decreed that one of you shall this night die by
<!-- Page 140 --><a name="Page_140"></a>poison, is it not decreed also
that he shall drink it?'</p>

<p>The crowd now gazed upon each other, without reply, for some minutes:
and at last they only said, that no effort of theirs could change the
universal appointment of all things; that if <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> was to be king alone, he would be so notwithstanding all
opposition; and that if he was not to be king alone, no attempt of his
own, however supported, could make him so. 'I will not,' said <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'contradict your opinion; I will only tell you
what I have heard, and leave you to, suffer the calamities which threaten
you, with a fortitude and resignation that are suitable to your
principles; having no consolation to <!-- Page 141 --><a name=
"Page_141"></a>offer you, but that <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
whose destiny it was not to make you happy, will suffer with you the
evils, that neither he nor you could prevent: the mournful comfort of this
fellowship, he will not be denied; for he loves you too well, to wish even
to be happy alone.' The crowd fixed their eyes upon <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, for whom their affection was now strongly moved,
with looks of much greater intelligence and sensibility; a confused
murmur, like the fall of the pebbles upon the beach when the surge retires
from the shore, expressed their gratitude to <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, and their apprehensions for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> waited till they were again silent,
and then improved the advantage he had gained. '<span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>,' <!-- Page 142 --><a name="Page_142"></a>said
he, 'considers you as the slaves of his power; <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> as the objects of his benevolence: your lives and your
properties, in the opinion of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, are
below his notice; but <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> considers his
own interest as connected with yours. When <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, therefore, shall be unchecked by the influence of <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; he will leave you to the mercy of some
delegated tyrant, whose whole power will be exerted to oppress you, that
he may enrich himself.'</p>

<p>A new fire was now kindled in their eyes, and their cheeks glowed with
indignation at the wrongs that threatened them; they were no longer
disposed to act upon the principles of fatality, as they had perversely
understood <!-- Page 143 --><a name="Page_143"></a>them; and they argued
at once like reasonable and free beings, whose actions were in their
choice, and who had no doubt but that their actions would produce adequate
effects. They recollected that <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> had, in
the reign of Solyman, often rescued them from such oppression, as now
threatened them; and that the power of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> had since interposed in their behalf, when <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> would have stretched his prerogative to their
hurt, or have left them a prey to the farmer of a tax. 'Shall <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>,' said they, 'be deprived of the power, that he
employs only for our benefit; and shall it center in <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who will abuse it to our ruin? Shall we rather
support <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> in the wrong he has done to
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, than HA<!-- Page 144 --><a name=
"Page_144"></a>MET to obtain justice of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>? <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> is our king; let him
command us, and we will obey.' This was uttered with a shout that ecchoed
from the mountains beyond the city, and continued near a full hour. In the
mean time, the multitude was increasing every moment; and the troops that
lay in and near the city, having taken arms, fell in with the stream: they
were secretly attached to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, under
whose eye they had been formed, and of whose bounty they had often
partaken; and their fear being removed by the general cry, which left them
no room to apprehend an opposition in favour of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, they were now at full liberty to follow their
inclinations.</p>

<!-- Page 145 --><a name="Page_145"></a>

<p>In the mean time, <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who had
retired to the innermost court of the palace, had heard the tumult, and
was alarmed for his safety: he ran from room to room, confused and
terrified, without attempting or directing any thing either for his
defence or escape, yet he sent every moment to know the state of the
insurrection, and to what end its force would be directed.</p>

<p>Among those whom accident rather than choice had attached to the
interest of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, were Osmyn and Caled:
they were both distinguished by his favour; and each had conceived hopes
that, if he should possess the throne alone, he would delegate his
authority to him. <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> now ordered them
<!-- Page 146 --><a name="Page_146"></a>to take the command of the troops,
that were appointed to attend his person as their peculiar duty, with as
many others as had not declared for <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
and to secure all the avenues that led to his seraglio.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> and <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> were now on horseback, and had begun to form the troops that
had joined them, and as many others as were armed, which were before
mingled together in a confused multitude. An account of this was brought
to <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> by Osmyn; and threw him into a
perturbation and perplexity, that disgraced his character, and confounded
his attendants. He urged Osmyn, in whom he most confided, to dispatch,
without giving him any orders to execute; then turning <!-- Page 147 --><a
name="Page_147"></a>from him, he uttered, in a low and inarticulate voice,
the most passionate exclamations of distress and terror, being struck with
the thought that his guard might betray him: when he recollected himself,
and perceived that Osmyn was still present, he burst into a rage, and
snatching out his poignard, he swore by the soul of the Prophet, that if
he did not instantly attempt something, he would stab him to the heart.
Osmyn drew back trembling and confused; but having yet received no orders,
he would have spoken, but <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> drove him
from his presence with menaces and execrations.</p>

<p>The moment that Osmyn left him, his rage subsided in his fears, and his
<!-- Page 148 --><a name="Page_148"></a>fears were mingled with remorse:
'Which way soever I turn,' said he, 'I see myself surrounded by
destruction. I have incensed Osmyn by unreasonable displeasure, and
causeless menaces. He must regard me at once with abhorrence and contempt:
and it is impossible, but he should revolt to <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>.'</p>

<p>In this agony, the terrors of futurity rushed upon his mind with all
their force; and he darted as if at the bite of a scorpion: 'To me,' said
he, 'death, that now approaches, will be but the beginning of sorrow. I
shall be cut off at once from enjoyment, and from hope; and the dreadful
moment is now at hand.' While he was speaking, the palace again shook,
<!-- Page 149 --><a name="Page_149"></a>and he stood again in the presence
of the Genius.</p>

<p>'<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,' said the inhabitant of the
unapparent world, 'the evil which thou fearest, shall not be upon thee.
Make haste, and shew thyself from the gallery to the people, and the
tumult of faction shall be still before thee: tell them, that their
rebellion is not against thee only, but against Him by whom thou reignest:
appeal boldly to that power for a confirmation of thy words, and rely for
the attesting sign upon me.' <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who
had stooped with his face to the ground, now looked upward, and found
himself alone: he hasted, therefore, to follow the directions he
<!-- Page 150 --><a name="Page_150"></a>had received; and hope was again
kindled in his bosom.</p>

<p>Osmyn, in the mean time, made a proper disposition of the troops now
under his command; and had directed a select company to remain near the
person of the king, that they might at least make good his retreat. While
he was waiting at his post, and revolving in his mind the total
disappointment of his hopes, and considering what he should do if <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> should establish himself alone, he was
joined by Caled.</p>

<p>Caled had a secret enmity against Osmyn, as his rival in the favour of
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>; but as he had concealed his own
pretensions from Osmyn, Osmyn had no ill will against Caled. As
<!-- Page 151 --><a name="Page_151"></a>they were now likely to be
involved in one common calamity, by the ruin of the prince whose party
they had espoused; Caled's enmity subsided, and the indifference of Osmyn
was warmed into kindness: mutual distress produced mutual confidence; and
Caled, after condoling with Osmyn on their present hopeless situation,
proposed that they should draw off their forces, and revolt to <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>. This proposition Osmyn rejected, not only
from principle, but from interest: 'Now we have accepted of a trust,' said
he, 'we ought not to betray it. If we had gone over to <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, when he first declared against his brother, he
would have received us with joy, and probably have rewarded our service;
but I know, that his virtue <!-- Page 152 --><a name="Page_152"></a>will
abhor us for treachery, though practised in his favour: treachery, under
the dominion of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, will not only cover
us with dishonour, but will probably devote us to death.'</p>

<p>In this reasoning, Caled could not but acquiesce; he felt himself
secretly but forcibly reproved, by the superior virtue of Osmyn: and while
he regretted his having made a proposal, which had been rejected not only
as imprudent but infamous; he concluded, that Osmyn would ever after
suspect and despise him; and he, therefore, from a new cause, conceived
new enmity against him. They parted, however, without any appearance of
suspicion <!-- Page 153 --><a name="Page_153"></a>or disgust; and, in a
short time, they were in circumstances very different from their
expectations.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had now reached the gallery; and
when the multitude saw him, they shouted as in triumph, and demanded that
he should surrender. <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who also
perceived him at a distance, and was unwilling that any violence should be
offered to <!-- Page 161 --><a name="Page_161"></a>his person, pressed
forward, and when he was come near, commanded silence. At this moment
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, with a loud voice, reproached them
with impiety and folly; and appealing to the power, whom in his person
they had offended, the air suddenly grew dark, a flood of lightning
descended from the sky, and a peal of thunder was articulated into these
words:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Divided sway, the God who reigns
alone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Abhors; and gives to <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> the throne.</span><br />


<p>The multitude stood aghast at the prodigy; and hiding their faces with
their hands, every one departed in silence and confusion, and <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> were left
alone. <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> was taken by some of the
soldiers who had <!-- Page 162 --><a name="Page_162"></a>adhered to <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, but <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>
made his escape.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, whose wishes were thus far
accomplished by the intervention of a power superior to his own, exulted
in the anticipation of that happiness which he now supposed to be secured;
and was fortified in his opinion, that he had been wretched only because
he had been weak, and that to multiply and not to suppress his wishes was
the way to acquire felicity.</p>

<p>As he was returning from the gallery, he was met by Osmyn and Caled,
who had heard the supernatural declaration in his behalf, and learned its
effects. <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, in that hasty flow of
unbounded but capricious favour, which, <!-- Page 163 --><a name=
"Page_163"></a>in contracted minds, is the effect only of unexpected good
fortune, raised Osmyn from his feet to his bosom: 'As in the trial,' said
he, 'thou hast been faithful, I now invest thee with a superior trust. The
toils of state shall from this moment devolve upon thee; and from this
moment, the delights of empire unallayed shall be mine: I will recline at
ease, remote from every eye but those that reflect my own felicity; the
felicity that I shall taste in secret, surrounded by the smiles of beauty,
and the gaities of youth. Like heaven, I will reign unseen; and like
heaven, though unseen, I will be adored.' Osmyn received this delegation
of power with a tumultuous pleasure, that was expressed only by silence
and confusion. <!-- Page 164 --><a name="Page_164"></a><span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> remarked it; and exulting in the pride of
power, he suddenly changed his aspect, and regarding Osmyn, who was yet
blushing, and whose eyes were swimming in tears of gratitude, with a stern
and ardent countenance; 'Let me, however,' said he, 'warn thee to be
watchful in thy trust: beware, that no rude commotion violate my peace by
thy fault; lest my anger sweep thee in a moment to destruction.' He then
directed his eye to Caled: 'And thou too,' said he, 'hast been faithful;
be thou next in honour and in power to Osmyn. Guard both of you my
paradise from dread and care; fulfill the duty that I have assigned you,
and live.'</p>

<!-- Page 165 --><a name="Page_165"></a>

<p>He was then informed by a messenger, that <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> had escaped, and that <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> was
taken. As he now despised the power both of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, he expressed neither
concern nor anger that <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> had fled; but
he ordered <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> to be brought before
him.</p>

<p>When <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> appeared bound and disarmed,
he regarded him with a smile of insult and derision; and asked him, what
he had now to hope. 'I have, indeed,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span>, 'much less to hope, than thou hast to fear.' 'Thy insolence,'
said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'is equal to thy folly: what
power on earth is there, that I should fear?' 'Thy own,' said <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span>. 'I have not leisure now,' replied <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'to <!-- Page 166 --><a name=
"Page_166"></a>hear the paradoxes of thy philosophy explained: but to shew
thee, that I fear not thy power, thou shalt live. I will leave thee to
hopeless regret; to wiles that have been scorned and defeated; to the
unheeded petulance of dotage; to the fondness that is repayed with
neglect; to restless wishes, to credulous hopes, and to derided command:
to the slow and complicated torture of despised old age; and that, when
thou shalt long have abhorred thy being, shall destroy it.' 'The misery,'
said <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'which thou hast menaced, it is
not in thy power to inflict. As thou hast taken from me all that I
possessed by the bounty of thy father, it is true that I am poor; it is
true also, that my knees are now feeble, and <!-- Page 167 --><a name=
"Page_167"></a>bend with the weight of years that is upon me. I am, as
thou art, a man; and therefore I have erred: but I have still kept the
narrow path in view with a faithful vigilance, and to that I have soon
returned: the past, therefore, I do not regret; and the future I have no
cause to fear. In Him who is most merciful, I have hope; and in that hope
even how I rejoice before thee. My portion in the present hour, is
adversity: but I receive it, not only with humility, but thankfulness; for
I know, that whatever is ordained is best.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, in whose heart there were no
traces of <span class="smallcaps">Omar's</span> virtue, and therefore no
foundation for his confidence; sustained himself against their
<!-- Page 168 --><a name="Page_168"></a>force, by treating them as
hypocrisy and affectation: 'I know,' says he, 'that thou hast long learned
to eccho the specious and pompous sounds, by which hypocrites conceal
their wretchedness, and excite the admiration of folly and the contempt of
wisdom: yet thy walk, in this place, shall be still unrestrained. Here the
splendor of my felicity shall fill thy heart with envy, and cover thy face
with confusion; and from thee shall the world be instructed, that the
enemies of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> can move no passion in
his breast but contempt, and that most to punish them is to permit them to
live.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, whose eye had till now been fixed
upon the ground, regarded <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>
<!-- Page 169 --><a name="Page_169"></a>with a calm but steady
countenance: 'Here then,' said he, 'will I follow thee, constant as thy
shadow; tho', as thy shadow, unnoticed or neglected: here shall mine eye
watch those evils, that were appointed from everlasting to attend upon
guilt: and here shall my voice warn thee of their approach. From thy
breast may they be averted by righteousness! for without this, though all
the worlds that roll above thee should, to aid thee, unite all their
power, that power can aid thee only to be wretched.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, in all the pride of gratified
ambition, invested with dominion that had no limits, and allied with
powers that were more than mortal; <!-- Page 170 --><a name=
"Page_170"></a>was overawed by this address, and his countenance grew
pale. But the next moment, disdaining to be thus controuled by the voice
of a slave, his cheeks were suffused with the blushes of indignation: he
turned from <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, in scorn, anger, and
confusion, without reply; and <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> departed
with the calm dignity of a benevolent and superior being, to whom the
smiles and frowns of terrestrial tyranny were alike indifferent, and in
whom abhorrence of the turpitude of vice was mingled with companion for
its folly.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XII.</h2>

<br />


<p>In the mean time, <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, who had been
conveyed to an apartment in <span class="smallcaps">Almoran's</span>
seraglio, and delivered to the care of those who attended upon his women,
suffered all that grief and terror could inflict upon a generous, a
tender, and a delicate mind; yet in this complicated distress, her
attention was principally fixed upon <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>.
The disappointment of his hope, and the violation of his right, were the
chief objects of her regret and her fears, in all that had already
happened, and in all that was still to come; every insult that might be
offered <!-- Page 172 --><a name="Page_172"></a>to herself, she considered
as an injury to him. Yet the thoughts of all that he might suffer in her
person, gave way to her apprehensions of what might befall him in his own:
in his situation, every calamity that her imagination could conceive, was
possible; her thoughts were, therefore, bewildered amidst an endless
variety of dreadful images, which started up before them which way soever
they were turned; and it was impossible that she could gain any certain
intelligence of his fate, as the splendid prison in which she was now
confined, was surrounded by mutes and eunuchs, of whom nothing could be
learned, or in whole report no confidence could be placed.</p>

<!-- Page 173 --><a name="Page_173"></a>

<p>While her mind was in this state of agitation and distress, she
perceived the door open, and the next moment <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> entered the apartment. When she saw him, she turned from
him with a look of unutterable anguish; and hiding her face in her veil,
she burst into tears. The tyrant was moved with her distress; for
unfeeling obduracy is the vice only of the old, whose sensibility has been
worn away by the habitual perpetration of reiterated wrongs.</p>

<p>He approached her with looks of kindness, and his voice was
involuntarily modulated to pity; she was, however, too much absorbed in
her own sorrows, to reply. He gazed upon her with tenderness and
admiration; <!-- Page 174 --><a name="Page_174"></a>and taking her hand
into his own, he pressed it ardently to his bosom: his compassion soon
kindled into desire, and from soothing her distress, he began to solicit
her love. This instantly roused her attention, and resentment now
suspended her grief: she turned from him with a firm and haughty step, and
instead of answering his professions, reproached him with her wrongs.
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, that he might at once address her
virtue and her passions, observed, that though he had loved her from the
first moment he had seen her, yet he had concealed his passion even from
her, till it had received the sanction of an invisible and superior power;
that he came, therefore, the messenger of heaven; and that he offered her
unrivalled empire and everlasting <!-- Page 175 --><a name=
"Page_175"></a>love. To this she answered only by an impatient and fond
enquiry after <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>. 'Think not of <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>; 'for why should he who is rejected of Heaven, be still the
favorite of <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>?' 'If thy hand,' said
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, 'could quench in everlasting
darkness, that vital spark of intellectual fire, which the word of the
Almighty has kindled in my breast to burn for ever, then might <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> cease to think of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>; but while that shall live, whatever form it
shall inhabit, or in whatever world it shall reside, his image shall be
for ever present, and to him shall my love be for ever true.' This glowing
declaration of her love for <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, was
immediately succeeded by a tender anxiety for his safety; and a sudden
<!-- Page 176 --><a name="Page_176"></a>reflection upon the probability of
his death, and the danger of his situation if alive, threw her again into
tears.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, whom the ardour and impetuosity
of her passions kept sometimes silent, and sometimes threw into confusion,
again attempted to sooth and comfort her: she often urged him to tell her
what was become of his brother, and he as often evaded the question. As
she was about to renew her enquiry, and reflected that it had already been
often made, and had not yet been answered, she thought that <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> had already put him to death: this threw her
into a new agony, of which he did not immediately discover the cause; but
as he soon learned it from <!-- Page 177 --><a name="Page_177"></a>her
reproaches and exclamations, he perceived that he could not hope to be
heard, while she was in doubt about the safety of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>. In order, therefore, to sooth her mind, and prevent its
being longer possessed with an image that excluded every other; he assumed
a look of concern and astonishment at the imputation of a crime, which was
at once so horrid and so unnecessary. After a solemn deprecation of such
enormous guilt, he observed, that as it was now impossible for <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> to succeed as his rival, either in empire
or in love, without the breach of a command, which he knew his virtue
would implicitly obey; he had no motive either to desire his death, or to
restrain his liberty: 'His walk' says he, 'is still uncircumscribed in
<!-- Page 178 --><a name="Page_178"></a>Persia, and except this chamber,
there is no part of the palace to which he is not admitted.'</p>

<p>To this declaration <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> listened, as
to the music of paradise; and it suspended for a-while every passion, but
her love: the sudden ease of her mind made her regardless of all about
her, and she had in this interval suffered <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> to remove her veil, without reflecting upon what he was
doing. The moment she recollected herself, she made a gentle effort to
recover it, with some confusion, but without anger. The pleasure that was
expressed in her eyes, the blush that glowed upon her cheek, and the
contest about the veil, which to an amorous imagination had an air of
dalliance, concurred <!-- Page 179 --><a name="Page_179"></a>to heighten
the passion of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> almost to phrensy:
she perceived her danger in his looks, and her spirits instantly took the
alarm. He seized her hand, and gazing ardently upon her, he conjured her,
with a tone and emphasis that strongly expressed the tumultuous vehemence
of his wishes, that she would renounce the rites which had been forbidden
above, and that she would receive him to whom by miracle she had been
alloted.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, whom the manner and voice of
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had terrified into silence,
answered him at first only with a look that expressed aversion and
disdain, overawed by fear. 'Wilt thou not,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, 'fulfill the decrees of Heaven? I conjure thee,
<!-- Page 180 --><a name="Page_180"></a>'by Heaven, to answer.' From this
solemn reference to Heaven, <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> derived
new fortitude: she instantly recollected, that she stood in the presence
of Him, by whose permission only every other power, whether visible or
invisible, can dispense evil or good: 'Urge no more,' said she, 'as the
decree of Heaven, that which is inconsistent with Divine perfection. Can
He in whose hand my heart is, command me to wed the man whom he has not
enabled me to love? Can the Pure, the Just, the Merciful, have ordained
that I should suffer embraces which I loath, and violate vows which His
laws permitted me to make? Can He have ordained a perfidious, a loveless,
and a joyless prostitution? What <!-- Page 181 --><a name=
"Page_181"></a>if a thousand prodigies should concur to enforce it a
thousand times, the deed itself would be a stronger proof that those
prodigies were the works of darkness, than those prodigies that the deed
was commanded by the Father of light.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, whose hopes were now blasted to
the root, who perceived that the virtue of <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> could neither be deceived nor overborne; that she at once
contemned his power, and abhorred his love; gave way to all the furies of
his mind, which now slumbered no more: his countenance expressed at once
anger, indignation, and despair; his gesture became furious, and his voice
was lost in menaces and execrations. <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> beheld him <!-- Page 182 --><a name="Page_182"></a>with an
earnest yet steady countenance, till he vowed to revenge the indignity he
had suffered, upon <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>. At the name of
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, her fortitude forsook her; the pride
of virtue gave way to the softness of love; her cheeks became pale, her
lips trembled, and taking hold of the robe of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, she threw herself at his feet. His fury was it first
suspended by hope and expectation; but when from her words, which grief
and terror had rendered scarce articulate, he could learn only that she
was pleading for <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, he burst from her
in an extasy of rage, and forcing his robe from her hand, with a violence
that dragged her after it, he rushed out of the chamber, and left her
prostrate upon the ground.</p>

<p>As he passed through the gallery with a hasty and disordered pace, he
was seen by <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>; who knowing that he was
returned from an interview with <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>,
and conjecturing from his appearance what had happened, judged that he
ought not to neglect this opportunity to warn him once more of the
delusive phantoms, which, under the appearance of pleasure, were leading
him to destruction: he, therefore, followed him unperceived, till he had
reached the apartment in which he had been used to retire alone, and heard
again the loud and tumultuous exclamations, which were wrung, from his
heart by the anguish of disappointment: 'What have I gained,' said he, 'by
absolute dominion! The slave who, secluded from the gales of life
<!-- Page 184 --><a name="Page_184"></a>and from the light of heaven toils
without hope in the darkness of the mine, riots in the delights of
paradise compared with me. By the caprice of one woman, I am robbed not
only of enjoyment but of peace, and condemned for ever to the torment of
unsatisfied desire.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, who was impatient to apprize him
that he was not alone, and to prevent his disclosing sentiments which he
wished to conceal, now threw himself upon the ground at his feet.
'Presumptuous slave!' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'from
whence, and wherefore art thou come?' 'I am come,' said <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'to tell thee that not the caprice of a woman,
but the wishes of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, have made <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> <!-- Page 185 --><a name=
"Page_185"></a>wretched.' The king, slung with the reproach, drew back,
and with a furious look laid his hand upon his poignard; but was
immediately restrained from drawing it, by his pride. 'I am come,' said
<span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'to repeat that truth, upon which,
great as thou art, thy fate is suspended. Thy power extends not to the
mind of another; exert it, therefore, upon thy own: suppress the wishes,
which thou canst not fulfill, and secure the happiness that is within thy
reach.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who could bear no longer to
hear the precepts which he disdained to practice, sternly commanded <span
class="smallcaps">Omar</span> to depart: 'Be gone,' said he, 'lest I crush
thee like a noisome reptile, which men cannot but abhor,
<!-- Page 186 --><a name="Page_186"></a>though it is too contemptible to
be feared.' 'I go,' said <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'that my
warning voice may yet again recall thee to the path of wisdom and of
peace, if yet again I shall behold thee while it is to be found.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was now left alone; and throwing
himself upon a sofa, he sat some time motionless and silent, as if all his
faculties had been suspended in the stupefaction of despair. He revolved
in his mind the wishes that had been gratified, and the happiness of which
he had been disappointed: 'I desired,' said he, 'the pomp and power of
undivided dominion; and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was driven
from the throne which he shared with me, by a voice from heaven: I desired
to break off his marriage with <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>; and
it was broken off by a prodigy, <!-- Page 188 --><a name=
"Page_188"></a>when no human power could have accomplished my desire. It
was my wish also to have the person of <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> in my power, and this wish also has been gratified; yet I
am still wretched. But I am wretched, only because the means have not been
adequate to the end: what I have hitherto obtained, I have not desired for
itself; and of that, for which I desired it, I am not possessed: I am,
therefore, still wretched, because I am weak. With the soul of <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, I should have the form of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>: then my wishes would indeed be filled; then
would <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> bless me with consenting
beauty, and the splendor of my power should distinguish only the intervals
of my love; my enjoyments would then be certain <!-- Page 189 --><a name=
"Page_189"></a>and permanent, neither blasted by disappointment, nor
withered by satiety.' When he had uttered these reflections with the
utmost vehemence and agitation, his face was again obscured by gloom and
despair; his posture was again fixed; and he was falling back into his
former state of silent abstraction, when he was suddenly roused by the
appearance of the Genius, the sincerity of whose friendship he began to
distrust.</p>

<p>'<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,' said the Genius, 'if thou art
not yet happy, know that my powers are not yet exhausted: fear me not, but
let thine ear be attentive to my voice.' The Genius then stretched out his
hand towards him, in which there was an emerald of <!-- Page 190 --><a
name="Page_190"></a>great lustre, cut into a figure that had four and
twenty sides, on each of which was engraven a different letter. 'Thou
seest,' said he, 'this talisman: on each side of it is engraven one of
those mysterious characters, of which are formed all the words of all the
languages that are spoken by angels, genii, and men. This shall enable
thee to change thy figure: and what, under the form of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, thou canst not accomplish; thou shalt still be
able to effect, if it can be effected by thee, in the form of any other.
Point only to the letters that compose the name of him whose appearance
thou wouldst assume, and it is done. Remember only, that upon him, whose
appearance thou shalt assume, thine shall be imprest, till thou
<!-- Page 191 --><a name="Page_191"></a>restorest his own. Hide the charm
in thy bosom, and avail thyself of its power.' <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> received the talisman in a transport of gratitude and joy,
and the Genius immediately disappeared.</p>

<p>The use of this talisman was so obvious, that it was impossible to
overlook it. <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> instantly conceived
the design with which it was given, and determined instantly to put it in
execution: 'I will now,' said he, 'assume the figure of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>; and my love, in all its ardour, shall be
returned by <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>.' As his fancy kindled
at the anticipation of his happiness, he stood musing in a pleasing
suspense, and indulged himself in the contemplation of the several
gradations, by <!-- Page 192 --><a name="Page_192"></a>which he would
ascend to the summit of his wishes.</p>

<p>Just at this moment, Osmyn, whom he had commanded to attend him at this
hour, approached his apartment: <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was
roused by the sound of his foot, and supposed it to be <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span>, who had again intruded upon his privacy; he was
enraged at the interruption which had broken a series of imaginations so
flattering and luxurious; he snatched out his poignard, and lifting up his
arm for the stroke, hastily turned round to have stabbed him; but seeing
Osmyn, he discovered his mistake just in time to prevent the blow.</p>

<p>Osmyn, who was not conscious of any crime, nor indeed of any act that
<!-- Page 193 --><a name="Page_193"></a>could have given occasion of
offence; started back terrified and amazed, and stood trembling in
suspense whether to remain or to withdraw. <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, in the mean time, sheathed the instrument of death, and
bid him fear nothing, for he should not be hurt. He then turned about; and
putting, his hand to his forehead, stood again, silent in a musing
posture: he recollected, that if he assumed the figure of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, it was necessary he should give orders for <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> to be admitted to <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>, as he would otherwise be excluded by the delegates of his
own authority; turning, therefore, to Osmyn, 'Remember,' said he, 'that
whenever <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> shall return, it is my
command, that he be admitted to <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>.'</p>

<!-- Page 194 --><a name="Page_194"></a>

<p>Osmyn; who was pleased with an opportunity of recommending himself to
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, by praising an act of generous
virtue which he supposed him now to exert in favour of his brother,
received the command with a look, that expressed not only approbation but
joy: 'Let the sword of destruction,' said he, 'be the guard of the tyrant;
the strength of my lord shall be the bonds of love: those, who honour thee
as <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, shall rejoice in thee as the
friend of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>.' To <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who was conscious to no kindness for his
brother, the praise of Osmyn was a reproach: he was offended at the joy
which he saw kindled in his countenance, by a command to shew favour to
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; and was fired <!-- Page 195 --><a
name="Page_195"></a>with sudden rage at that condemnation of his real
conduct, which was implied by an encomium on the generosity of which he
assumed the appearance for a malevolent and perfidious purpose: his brow
was contracted, his lip quivered, and the hilt of his dagger was again
grasped in his hand. Osmyn was again overwhelmed with terror and
confusion; he had again offended, but knew not his offence. In the mean
time, <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> recollecting that to express
displeasure against Osmyn was to betray his own secret, endeavoured to
suppress his anger; but his anger was succeeded by remorse, regret, and
disappointment. The anguish of his mind broke out in imperfect murmurs:
'What I am, said, he, 'is, to this wretch, the object not only of hatred
but of scorn; and <!-- Page 196 --><a name="Page_196"></a>he commends only
what I am not, in what to him I would seem to be.</p>

<p>These sounds, which, tho' not articulate, were yet uttered with great
emotion, were still mistaken by Osmyn for the overflowings of capricious
and causeless anger: 'My life,' says he to himself, 'is even now suspended
in a doubtful balance. Whenever I approach this tyrant, I tread the
borders of destruction: like a hood-winked wretch, who is left to wander
near the brink of a precipice, I know my danger; but which way soever I
turn, I know not whether I shall incur or avoid it.'</p>

<p>In these reflections, did the reign and the slave pass those moments
<!-- Page 197 --><a name="Page_197"></a>in which the sovereign intended to
render the slave subservient to his pleasure or his security, and the
slave intended to express a zeal which he really felt, and a homage which
his heart had already paid. Osmyn was at length, however, dismissed with
an assurance, that all was well; and <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> was again left to reflect with anguish upon the past, to
regret the present, and to anticipate the future with solicitude, anxiety,
and perturbation.</p>

<p>He was, however, determined to assume the figure of his brother, by the
talisman which had been put into his power by the Genius: but just as he
was about to form the spell, he recollected, that by the same act he would
impress his own likeness upon <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>
<!-- Page 198 --><a name="Page_198"></a>who would consequently be invested
with his power, and might use it to his destruction. This held him some
time in suspense: but reflecting that <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>
might not, perhaps, be apprized of his advantage, till it was too late to
improve it; that he was now a fugitive, and probably alone, leaving Persia
behind him with all the speed he could make; and that, at the worst, if he
should be still near, if he should know the transformation as soon as it
should be made, and should instantly take the most effectual measures to
improve it; yet as he could dissolve the charm in a moment, whenever it
should be necessary for his safety, no formidable danger could be incurred
by the experiment, to which he, therefore, proceeded without delay.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XIV.</h2>

<br />


<p>In the mean time, <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, to whom his own
safety was of no importance but for the sake of <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>, resolved, if possible, to conceal himself near the city.
Having, therefore, reached the confines of the desert, by which it was
bounded on the east, he quitted his horse, and determined to remain there
till the multitude was dispersed; and the darkness of the evening might
conceal his return, when in less than an hour he could reach the
palace.</p>

<p>He sat down at the foot of the mountain Kabessed, without considering,
<!-- Page 200 --><a name="Page_200"></a>that in this place he was most
likely to be found, as those who travel the desert seldom fail to enter
the cave that winds its way under the mountain, to drink of the water that
issues there from a clear and copious spring.</p>

<p>He reviewed the scenes of the day that was now nearly passed, with a
mixture of astonishment and distress, to which no description can be equal
The sudden and amazing change that a few hours had made in his situation,
appeared like a wild and distressful dream, from which he almost doubted
whether he should not wake to the power and the felicity that he had lost.
He sat some time bewildered in the hurry and multiplicity of his thoughts,
and at length burst out into passionate <!-- Page 201 --><a name=
"Page_201"></a>exclamations: 'What,' says he, 'and where am I? Am I,
indeed, <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; that son of Solyman who
divided the dominion of Persia with his brother, and who possessed the
love of <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> alone? Dreadful
vicissitude! I am now an outcast, friendless and forlorn; without an
associate, and without a dwelling: for me the cup of adversity overflows,
and the last dregs of sorrow have been wrung out for my portion: the
powers not only of the earth, but of the air, have combined against me;
and how can I stand alone before them? But is there no power that will
interpose in my behalf? If He, who is supreme, is good, I shall not
perish. But wherefore am I thus? Why should the desires of vice be
<!-- Page 202 --><a name="Page_202"></a>accomplished by superior powers;
and why should superior powers be permitted to disappoint the expectations
of virtue? Yet let me not rashly question the ways of Him, in whose
balance the world is weighed: by Him, every evil is rendered subservient
to good; and by His wisdom, the happiness of the whole is secured. Yet I
am but a part only, and for a part only I can feel. To me, what is that
goodness of which I do not partake? In my cup the gall is unmixed; and
have I not, therefore, a right to complain? But what have I said? Let not
the gloom that surrounds me, hide from me the prospect of immortality.
Shall not eternity atone for time? Eternity, to which the duration of ages
is but <!-- Page 203 --><a name="Page_203"></a>as an atom to a world!
Shall I not, when this momentary separation is past, again meet <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> to part no more? and shall not a purer
flame than burns upon the earth, unite us? Even at this moment, her mind,
which not the frauds of sorcery can taint or alienate, is mine: that
pleasure which she reserved for me, cannot be taken by force; it is in the
consent alone that it subsists; and from the joy that she feels, and from
that only, proceeds the joy she can bestow.'</p>

<p>With these reflections he soothed the anguish of his mind, till the
dreadful moment arrived, in which the power of the talisman took place,
and the figure of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was changed into
<!-- Page 204 --><a name="Page_204"></a>that of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, and the figure of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> into
that of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>.</p>

<p>At the moment of transformation, <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>
was seized with a sudden languor, and his faculties were suspended as by
the stroke of death. When he recovered, his limbs still trembled, and his
lips were parched with thirst: he rose, therefore, and entering the
cavern, at the mouth of which he had been sitting, he stooped over the
well to drink; but glancing his eyes upon the water, he saw, with
astonishment and horror, that it reflected, not his own countenance, but
that of his brother. He started back from the prodigy; and supporting
himself against the side of the rock, he stood some time like a statue,
without the power <!-- Page 205 --><a name="Page_205"></a>of recollection:
but at length the thought suddenly rushed into his mind, that the same
sorcery which had suspended his marriage, and driven him from the throne
was still practised against him; and that the change of his figure to that
of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, was the effect of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran's</span> having assumed his likeness, to obtain, in
this disguise, whatever <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> could
bestow. This thought, like a whirlwind of the desert, totally subverted
his mind; his fortitude was borne down, and his hopes were rooted up; no
principles remained to regulate his conduct, but all was phrensy,
confusion, and despair. He rushed out of the cave with a furious and
distracted look; and went in haste towards the city, without having formed
any design, <!-- Page 206 --><a name="Page_206"></a>or considered any
consequence that might follow.</p>

<p>The shadows of the mountains were now lengthened by the declining sun;
and the approach of evening had invited <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span> to meditate in a grove, that was adjacent to the gardens of
the palace. From this place he was seen at some distance by <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who came up to him with a hasty and disordered
pace; and <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> drew back with a cold and
distant reverence, which the power and the character of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> concurred to excite. <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, not reflecting upon the cause of this behaviour, was
offended, and reproached him with the want of that friendship he had so
often professed: the vehemence, of his expression and demeanor, suited
well with <!-- Page 207 --><a name="Page_207"></a>the appearance of <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>; and <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>,
as the best proof of that friendship which had been impeached, took this
opportunity to repeat his admonitions in the behalf of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>: 'What ever evil,' said he, 'thou canst bring
upon <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, will be doubled to thyself: to
his virtues, the Power that fills infinitude is a friend, and he can be
afflicted only till they are perfect; but thy sufferings will be the
punishment of vice, and as long as thou are vicious they must
increase.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who instantly recollected for
whom he was mistaken, and the anguish of whose mind was for a moment
suspended by this testimony of esteem and kindness, which could not
possibly be feigned, and which was <!-- Page 208 --><a name=
"Page_208"></a>paid him at the risque of life, when it could not be known
that he received it; ran forward to embrace the hoary sage, who had been
the guide of his youth, and cried out, in a voice that was broken by
contending passions, 'The face is the face of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, but the heart is the heart of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Omar</span> was struck dumb with astonishment;
and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who was impatient to be longer
mistaken, related all the circumstances of his transformation, and
reminded him of some particulars which could be known only to themselves:
'Canst thou not yet believe,' said he, 'that I am <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>? when thou hast this day seen me banished from my kingdom;
when thou hast now met me a fugitive <!-- Page 209 --><a name=
"Page_209"></a>returning from the desert; and when I learnt from thee,
since the sun was risen which is not yet set, that more than mortal powers
were combined against me.' 'I now believe,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Omar</span>, 'that thou, indeed, art <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>.' 'Stay me not then,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>; 'but come with me to revenge.' 'Beware,' said <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'lest thou endanger the loss of more than empire
and <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>.' 'If not to revenge,' said
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,' I may at least be permitted to
punish.' 'Thy mind,' says <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, 'is now in
such a state, that to punish the crimes by which thou hast been wronged,
will dip thee in the guilt of blood. Why else are we forbidden to take
vengeance for ourselves? and why is it reserved as the prerogative of the
<!-- Page 210 --><a name="Page_210"></a>Most High? In Him, and in Him
alone, it is goodness guided by wisdom: He approves the means, only as
necessary to the end; He wounds only to heal, and destroys only to save;
He has complacence, not in the evil, but in the good only which it is
appointed to produce. Remember, therefore, that he, to whom the punishment
of another is sweet; though his act may be just with respect to others,
with respect to himself it is a deed of darkness, and abhorred by the
Almighty.' <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who had stood abstracted
in the contemplation of the new injury he had suffered, while <span class=
"smallcaps">Omar</span> was persuading him not to revenge it, started from
his posture in all the wildness of distraction; <!-- Page 211 --><a name=
"Page_211"></a>and bursting away from <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>,
with an ardent and furious look hasted toward the palace, and was soon out
of sight.</p>

<p>In the mean time, <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, after having
effected the transformation, was met, as he was going to the apartment of
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, by Osmyn. Osmyn had already
experienced the misery of dependent greatness, that kept him continually
under the eye of a capricious tyrant, whose temper was various as the
gales of summer, and whose anger was sudden as the bolt of heaven; whose
purpose and passions were dark and impetuous as the midnight storm, and at
whose command death was inevitable as the approach of time. When
<!-- Page 213 --><a name="Page_213"></a>he saw <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, therefore, in the likeness of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, he felt a secret desire to apprize him of his situation, and
offer him his friendship.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who with the form assumed the
manners of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, addressed Osmyn with a
mild though mournful countenance: 'At length,' said he, 'the will of <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> alone is law; does it permit me to hold a
private rank in this place, without molestation?' 'It permits,' said
Osmyn, 'yet more; he has commanded, that you should have admittance to
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>.' <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, whose vanity betrayed him to flatter his own power in the
person of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, replied with a smile: 'I
know, that <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who presides like a God
in silent <!-- Page 214 --><a name="Page_214"></a>and distant state,
reveals the secrets of his will to thee; I know that thou art'&mdash;'I
am,' said Osmyn, 'of all thou seest, most wretched.' At this declaration,
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> turned short, and fixed his eyes
upon Osmyn with a look of surprize and anger: 'Does not the favour of
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,' said he, 'whose smile is power,
and wealth, and honour, shine upon thee?' 'My lord,' said Osmyn, 'I know
so well the severity of thy virtue, that if I should, even for thy sake,
become perfidious to thy brother'&mdash;<span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who was unable to preserve the character of
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> with propriety, interrupted him with
a fierce and haughty tone: 'How!' said he, 'perfidious to
<!-- Page 215 --><a name="Page_215"></a>my brother! to <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> perfidious!'</p>

<p>Osmyn, who had now gone too far to recede, and who still saw before him
the figure of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, proceeded in his
purpose: 'I knew,' said he, 'that in thy judgment I should be condemned;
and yet, the preservation of life is the strongest principle of nature,
and the love of virtue is her proudest boast.' 'Explain thyself,' said
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'for I cannot comprehend thee.' 'I
mean,' said Osmyn, 'that he, whose life depends upon the caprice of a
tyrant, is like the wretch whose sentence is already pronounced; and who,
if the wind does but rush by his dungeon, imagines that it is the
bow-string and the <!-- Page 216 --><a name="Page_216"></a>mute.' 'Fear
not,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who now affected to be
again calm; 'be still faithful, and thou shalt still be safe.' 'Alas!'
said Osmyn, there is no diligence, no toil, no faith, that can secure the
slave from the sudden phrensy of passion, from, the causeless rage either
of drunkenness or lust. I am that slave; the slave of a tyrant whom I
hate.' The confusion of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was now too
great to be concealed, and he stood silent with rage, fear, and
indignation. Osmyn, supposing that his wonder suspended his belief of what
he had heard, confirmed his declaration by an oath.</p>

<p>Whoever thou art, to whose mind <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,
the mighty and the proud, <!-- Page 217 --><a name="Page_217"></a>is
present; before whom, the lord of absolute dominion stands trembling and
rebuked; who seest the possessor of power by which nature is controuled,
pale and silent with anguish and disappointment: if, in the fury of thy
wrath, thou hast aggravated weakness into guilt; if thou hast chilled the
glow of affection, when it flushed the cheek in thy presence, with the
frown of displeasure, or repressed the ardour of friendship with
indifference or neglect; now, let thy heart smite thee: for, in thy folly,
thou hast cast away that gem, which is the light of life; which power can
never seize, and which gold can never buy!</p>

<p>The tyrant fell at once from his pride, like a star from Heaven; and
<!-- Page 218 --><a name="Page_218"></a>Osmyn, still addressing him as
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, at once increased his misery and his
fears: 'O,' said he, 'that the throne of Persia was thine! then should
innocence enjoy her birth-right of peace, and hope should bid honest
industry look upward. There is not one to whom <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> has delegated power, nor one on whom his transient favour
has bestowed any gift, who does not already feel his heart throb with the
pangs of boding terror. Nor is there one who, if he did not fear the
displeasure of the invisible power by whom the throne has been given to
thy brother, would not immediately revolt to thee.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who had hitherto remained
silent, now burst into a passionate <!-- Page 219 --><a name=
"Page_219"></a>exclamation of self pity: 'What can I do?' said he; 'and
whither can I turn?' Osmyn, who mistook the cause of his distress, and
supposed that he deplored only his want of power to avail himself of the
general disposition in his favour, endeavoured to fortify his mind against
despair: 'Your state,' said he, 'indeed is distressful, but not hopeless.'
The king who, though addressed as, <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
was still betrayed by his confusion to answer as <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, smote his breast, and replied in an agony, 'It is
hopeless!' Osmyn remarked his emotion and despair, with, a concern and
astonishment that <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> observed, and at
once recollected his situation. He endeavoured to retract such expressions
of trouble and despondency, <!-- Page 220 --><a name="Page_220"></a>as did
not suit the character he hid assumed; and telling Osmyn that he thanked
him for his friendship; and would improve the advantages it offered him,
he directed him to acquaint the eunuchs that they were to admit him to
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>. When he was left alone; his doubts
and perplexity held him long in suspense; a thousand expedients occurred
to his mind by turns, and by turns were rejected.</p>

<p>His first thought was to put Osmyn to death: but he considered; that by
this he would gain no advantage, as he would be in equal danger from
whoever should succeed him: he considered also, that against Osmyn he was
upon his guard; and that he might at any time learn, from him, whatever
<!-- Page 221 --><a name="Page_221"></a>design might be formed in favour
of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, by assuming <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet's</span> appearance: that he would thus be the confident
of every secret, in which his own safety was concerned; and might
disconcert the best contrived project at the very moment of its execution,
when it would be too late for other measures to be taken: he determined,
therefore, to let Osmyn live; at least, till it became more necessary to
cut him off. Having in some degree soothed and fortified his mind by these
reflections, he entered the apartment of <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>.</p>

<p>His hope was not founded upon a design to marry her under the
appearance of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; for that would be
impossible, as the ceremony must have been performed by the priests who
supposed <!-- Page 222 --><a name="Page_222"></a>the marriage with <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> to have been forbidden by a divine command;
and who, therefore, would not have consented, even supposing they would
otherwise have ventured, at the request of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, to perform a ceremony which they knew would be displeasing
to <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>: but he hoped to take advantage
of her tenderness for his brother, and the particular circumstances of her
situation, which made the solemnities of marriage impossible, to seduce
her to gratify his desires, without the sanction which alone rendered the
gratification of them lawful: if he succeeded in this design, he had
reason to expert, either that his love would be extinguished by enjoyment;
or that, if he should still desire to marry <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>, he might, by disclosing to her the artifice by which he
had <!-- Page 223 --><a name="Page_223"></a>effected his purpose, prevail
upon her to consent, as her connexion with <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, the chief obstacle to her marriage with him, would then be
broken for ever; and as she might, perhaps, wish to sanctify the pleasure
which she might be not unwilling to repeat, or at least to make that
lawful which it would not be in her power to prevent.</p>

<p>In this disposition, and with this design, he was admitted to <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>; who, without suspicion of her danger,
was exposed to the severest trial, in which every passion concurred to
oppose her virtue: she was solicited by all the powers of subtilty and
desire, under the appearance of a lover whose tenderness and fidelity had
been long tried, and whose passion she returned with <!-- Page 224 --><a
name="Page_224"></a>equal constancy and ardour; and she was thus
solicited, when the rites which alone could consecrate their union, were
impossible, and were rendered impossible by the guilty designs of a rival,
in whose power she was, and from whom no other expedient offered her a
deliverance. Thus deceived and betrayed, she received him with an excess
of tenderness and joy, which flattered all his hopes, and for a moment
suspended his misery. She enquired, with a fond and gentle solicitude, by
what means he had gained admittance, and how he had provided for his
retreat. He received and returned her caresses with a vehemence, in which,
to less partial eyes, desire would have been more apparent than love; and
in the tumult of his passion, he almost neglected her <!-- Page 225 --><a
name="Page_225"></a>enquiries: finding, however, that she would be
answered, he told her, that being by the permission of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> admitted to every part of the palace, except
that of the women, he had found means to bribe the eunuch who kept the
door; who was not in danger of detection, because <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, wearied with the tumult and fatigue of the day, had
retired to sleep, and given order to be called at a certain hour. She then
complained of the felicitations to which she was exposed, expressed her
dread of the consequences she had reason to expect from some sudden sally
of the tyrant's rage, and related with tears the brutal outrage she had
suffered when he last left her. 'Though I abhorred him,' said she, 'I yet
kneeled before him for thee. <!-- Page 226 --><a name="Page_226"></a>Let
me bend in reverence to that Power, at whose look the whirlwinds are
silent, and the seas are calm, that his fury has hitherto been restrained
from hurting thee!'</p>

<p>At these words, the face of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was
again covered with the blushes of confusion: to be still beloved only as
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, and as <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> to be still hated; to be thus reproached without anger, and
wounded by those who knew not that they struck him; was a species of
misery peculiar to himself, and had been incurred only by the acquisition
of new powers, which he had requested and received as necessary to obtain
that felicity, which the parsimony of nature had placed beyond his reach.
His emotions, however, as by <!-- Page 227 --><a name="Page_227"></a><span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> they were supposed to be the emotions of
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, she imputed to a different cause:
'As Heaven,' says she, 'has preserved thee from death; so has it, for thy
sake, preserved me from violation.' <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, whose passion had in this interval again surmounted his
remorse, gazed eagerly upon her, and catching her to his bosom; 'Let us at
least,' says he, 'secure the happiness that is now offered; let not these
inestimable moments pass by us unimproved; but to shew that we deserve
them, let them be devoted to love.' 'Let us then,' said <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>, 'escape together.' 'To escape with thee,'
said: <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'is impossible. I shall
retire, and, like the shaft of Arabia, leave no mark behind, me; but the
<!-- Page 228 --><a name="Page_228"></a>flight of <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> will at once be traced to him by whom I was admitted, and I
shall thus retaliate his friendship with destruction.' 'Let him then,'
said <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, 'be the partner of our
flight.' 'Urge it not now,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>;
'but trust to my prudence and my love, to select some hour that will be
more favourable to our purpose. And yet,' said he, 'even then, we shall,
as now, sigh in vain for the completion of our wishes: by whom shall our
hands be joined, when in the opinion of the priests it has been forbidden
from above?' 'Save thyself then,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>, and leave me to my fate.' 'Not so,' said <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>. 'What else,' replied <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>, 'is in our power?' 'It is in our power,' said
<!-- Page 229 --><a name="Page_229"></a><span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'to seize that joy, to which a public form can
give us no new claim; for the public form can only declare that right by
which I claim it now.'</p>

<p>As they were now reclining upon a sofa, he threw his arm round her; but
she suddenly sprung up, and burst from him: the tear started to her eye,
and she gazed upon him with an earnest but yet tender look: 'Is it?' says
she&mdash;'No sure, it is not the voice of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>!' 'O! yes,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,
'what other voice should call thee to cancel at once the wrongs of <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>;
to secure the treasures of thy love from the hand of the robber; to hide,
the joys, which if now we lose we may lose for ever, in the
<!-- Page 230 --><a name="Page_230"></a>sacred and inviolable stores of
the past, and place them beyond the power not of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> only but of fate?' With this wild effusion of desire, he
caught her again to his breast, and finding no resistance his heart
exulted in his success; but the next moment, to the total disappointment
of his hopes, he perceived that she had fainted in his arms. When she
recovered, she once more disengaged herself from him, and turning away her
face, she burst into tears. When her voice could be heard, she covered
herself with her veil, and turning again towards him, 'All but this,' said
she, 'I had learnt to bear; and how has this been deserved by <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span> of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>? You
was my only solace in distress; and when the tears have stolen from my
eyes in silence <!-- Page 231 --><a name="Page_231"></a>and in solitude, I
thought on thee; I thought upon the chaste ardour of thy sacred
friendship, which was softened, refined, and exalted into love. This was
my hoarded treasure; and the thoughts of possessing this; soothed all my
anguish with a miser's happiness, who, blest in the consciousness of
hidden wealth, despises cold and hunger, and rejoices in the midst of all
the miseries that make poverty dreadful: this was my last retreat; but I
am now desolate and forlorn, and my soul looks round, with terror, for
that refuge which it can never find.' 'Find that refuge,' said <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'in me.' 'Alas!' said <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>, 'can he afford me refuge from my sorrows, who,
for the guilty pleasures of a transient moment, <!-- Page 232 --><a name=
"Page_232"></a>would forever sully the purity of my mind, and aggravate
misfortune by the consciousness of guilt?'</p>

<p>As <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> now perceived, that it was
impossible, by any importunity, to induce her to violate her principles;
he had nothing more to attempt, but to subvert them. 'When,' said he,
'shall <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> awake, and these dreams of
folly and superstition vanish? That only is virtue, by which happiness is
produced; and whatever produces happiness, is therefore virtue; and the
forms, and words and rites, which priests have pretended to be required by
Heaven, are the fraudful arts only by which they govern mankind.'</p>

<p><!-- Page 233 --><a name="Page_233"></a><span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>, by this impious insult, was roused from grief
to indignation: 'As thou hast now dared,' said she, 'to deride the laws,
which thou wouldst first have broken; so hast thou broken for ever the
tender bonds, by which my soul was united to thine. Such as I fondly
believed thee, thou art not; and what thou art, I have never loved. I have
loved a delusive phantom only, which, while I strove to grasp it, has
vanished from me.' <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> attempted to
reply; but on such a subject, neither her virtue nor her wisdom would
permit debate. 'That prodigy,' said she, 'which I thought was the sleight
of cunning, or the work of sorcery, I now revere as the voice of Heaven;
which, as it knew thy heart, <!-- Page 234 --><a name="Page_234"></a>has
in mercy saved me from thy arms. To the will of Heaven shall my will be
obedient; and my voice also shall pronounce, to <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, whose whole soul was now
suspended in attention, conceived new hopes of success; and foresaw the
certain accomplishment of his purpose, though by an effect directly
contrary to that which he had laboured to produce. Thus to have incurred
the hatred of <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> in the form of <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, was more fortunate than to have taken
advantage of her love; the path that led to his wishes was now clear and
open; and his marriage with <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> in his
own person, waited only till he could resume it. He, therefore,
<!-- Page 235 --><a name="Page_235"></a>instead of soothing, provoked her
resentment: 'If thou hast loved a phantom,' said he, 'which existed only
in imagination; on such a phantom my love also has been fixed: thou hast,
indeed, only the form of what I called <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>; my love thou hast rejected, because thou hast never loved;
the object of thy passion was not <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
but a throne; and thou hast made the observance of rituals, in which folly
only can suppose there is good or ill, a pretence to violate thy faith,
that thou mayst still gratify thy ambition.'</p>

<p>To this injurious reproach, <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> made
no reply; and <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> immediately quitted
her apartment, that he might reassume his own figure, <!-- Page 236 --><a
name="Page_236"></a>take advantage of the disposition which, under the
appearance of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, he had produced in
favour of himself: But Osmyn, who supposing him to be <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, had intercepted and detained him as he was going
to <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, now intercepted him a second
time at his return, having placed himself near the door of the apartment
for that purpose.</p>

<p>Osmyn was by no means satisfied with the issue of their last interview:
he had perceived a perturbation in the mind of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, for which, imagining him to be <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, he could not account; and which seemed more extraordinary
upon a review, than when it happened; he, therefore, again entered into
conversation with him, in which he <!-- Page 237 --><a name=
"Page_237"></a>farther disclosed his sentiments and designs. <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, notwithstanding the impatience natural to his
temper and situation, was thus long detained listening to Osmyn, by the
united influence of his curiosity and his fears; his enquiries still
alarmed him with new terrors, by discovering new objects of distrust, and
new instances of disaffection: still, however, he resolved, not yet to
remove Osmyn from his post, that he might give no alarm by any appearance
of suspicion, and consequently learn with more ease; and detect with more
certainty, any project that might be formed against him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, as soon as she was left alone,
began to review the scene that had just past; and was every moment
affected with new wonder, grief, and resentment. She now deplored her own
misfortune; and now conceived a design to punish the author of it, from
whose face she supposed the hand of adversity had torn the mask under
which he had deceived her: it appeared to her very easy, to take a severe
revenge upon <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> for the indignity which
she supposed he had offered her, by complaining of it <!-- Page 239 --><a
name="Page_239"></a>to <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>; and telling
him, that he had gained admittance to her by bribing the eunuch who kept
the door. The thought of thus giving him up, was one moment rejected, as
arising from a vindictive spirit; and the next indulged, as an act of
justice to <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, and a punishment due to
the hypocrisy of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>: to the first she
inclined, when her grief, which was still mingled with a tender
remembrance of the man she loved, was predominant; and to the last, when
her grief gave way to indignation.</p>

<p>Thus are we inclined to consider the same action, either as a virtue,
or a vice, by the influence of different passions, which prompt us either
to perform or to avoid it. <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, from
deliberating <!-- Page 240 --><a name="Page_240"></a>whether she should
accuse <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> to <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, or conceal his fault, was led to consider what punishment
he would either incur or escape in consequence of her determination; and
the images that rushed into her mind, the moment this became the object of
her thoughts, at once determined her to be silent: 'Could I bear to see,'
said she, 'that hand, which has so often trembled with delight when it
enfolded mine, convulsed and black! those eyes, that as often as they
gazed upon me were dissolved in tears of tenderness and love, start from
the sockets! and those lips that breathed the softest sighs of elegant
desire, distorted and gasping in the convulsions of death!'</p>

<p><!-- Page 241 --><a name="Page_241"></a>From this image, her mind
recoiled in an agony of terror and pity; her heart sunk within her; her
limbs trembled she sunk down upon the sofa, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>By this time, <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, on whose form the
likeness of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was still impressed,
had reached the palace. He went instantly towards the apartment of the
women. Instead of that chearful alacrity, that mixture of zeal and
reverence and affection, which his eye had been used to find where-ever it
was turned, he now observed confusion, anxiety and terror; whoever he met,
made haste to prostrate themselves before him, and feared to look up till
he was past. He went on, however, with a hasty pace; and coming up
<!-- Page 242 --><a name="Page_242"></a>to the eunuch's guard, he said
with an impatient tone; 'To <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>.' The
slave immediately made way before him, and conducted him to the door of
the apartment, which he would not otherwise have been able to find, and
for which he could not directly enquire.</p>

<p>When he entered, his countenance expressed all the passions that his
situation had roused in his mind. He first looked sternly round him, to
see whether <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was not present; and
then fetching a deep sigh he turned his eyes, with a look of mournful
tenderness, upon <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>. His first view
was to discover, whether <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had
already supplanted him; and for this purpose he collected the whole
strength <!-- Page 243 --><a name="Page_243"></a>of his mind: he
considered that he appeared now, not as <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, but as <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>; and that he
was to question <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> concerning <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, while she had mistaken him for <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; he was therefore to maintain the
character, at whatever expence, till his doubts were resolved, and his
fears either removed or confirmed: he was so firmly persuaded, that <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had been there before him, that he did
not ask the question, but supposed the fact; he restrained alike both his
tenderness and his fears; and looking earnestly upon <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>, who had risen up in his presence with blushes
and confusion, 'To me,' says he, 'is <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> still cold? and has she lavished all her love upon <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>?'</p>

<p><!-- Page 244 --><a name="Page_244"></a>At the name of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, the blushes and confusion of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span> increased: her mind was still full of the
images, which had risen from the thought of what <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> might suffer, if <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>
should know that he had been with her; and though she feared that their
interview was discovered, yet she hoped it might be only suspected, and in
that case the removal or confirmation of the suspicions, on which the fate
of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> depended, would devolve upon
her.</p>

<p>In this situation, she, who a few moments before doubted, whether she
should not voluntarily give him up, when nothing more was necessary for
his safety than to be silent; now determined, with whatever reluctance,
<!-- Page 245 --><a name="Page_245"></a>to secure him, though it could not
he done without dissimulation, and though it was probable that in this
dissimulation she would be detected. Instead, therefore, of answering the
question, she repeated it: 'On whom said my lord, on <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>?' <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, whose
suspicions were increased by the evasion, replied with great emotion,
'Aye, on <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; did he not this moment
leave you?' 'Leave me this moment?' said <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>, with yet greater confusion, and deeper blushes. <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, in the impatience of his jealousy,
concluded, that the passions which he saw expressed in her countenance,
and which arose from the struggle between her regard to truth and her
tenderness for <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, proceeded
<!-- Page 246 --><a name="Page_246"></a>from the consciousness of what he
had most reason to dread, and she to conceal, a breach of virtue, to which
she had been betrayed by his own appearance united with the vices of his
brother: he, therefore, drew back from her with a look of inexpressible
anguish, and stood some time silent. She observed, that in his countenance
there was more expression of trouble, than rage; she, therefore, hoped to
divert him from persuing his enquiries, by at once removing his jealousy;
which she supposed would be at an end, as soon as she should disclose the
resolution she had taken in his favour. Addressing him, therefore, as
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, with a voice which though it was
gentle and soothing, was yet mournful and tremulous; 'Do not turn from
me,' said she, <!-- Page 247 --><a name="Page_247"></a>with those
unfriendly and frowning looks; give me now that love which so lately you
offered, and with all the future I will atone the past.'</p>

<p>Upon <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, whose heart involuntarily
answered to the voice of <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, these
words had irresistible and instantaneous force; but recollecting, in a
moment, whose form he bore, and to whom they were addressed, they struck
him with new astonishment, and increased the torments of his mind.
Supposing what he at first feared had happened, and that <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> had seduced her as <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>; he could not account for her now addressing him, as <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, with words of favour and compliance: he,
therefore, renewed his enquiries concerning himself, with apprehensions
<!-- Page 248 --><a name="Page_248"></a>of a different kind. She, who was
still solicitous to put an end to the enquiry, as well for the sake of
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, as to prevent her own embarrassment,
replied with a sigh, 'Let not thy peace be interrupted by one thought of
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; for of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> shall think no more.'
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who, though he had fortified himself
against whatever might have happened to her person, could not bear the
alienation of her mind, cried our, with looks of distraction and a voice
scarcely human, 'Not think of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>!' <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, whose astonishment was every moment
increasing, replied, with a tender and interesting enquiry, 'Is <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> then offended, that <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span> mould think of <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> no more?' <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, being thus
<!-- Page 249 --><a name="Page_249"></a>addressed by the name of his
brother, again recollected his situation; and now first conceived the
idea, that the alteration of <span class="smallcaps">Almeida's</span>
sentiments with respect to himself, might be the effect of some violence
offered her by <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> in his likeness; he,
therefore, recurred to his first purpose, and determined, by a direct
enquiry, to discover whether she had seen him under that appearance. This
enquiry he urged with the utmost solemnity and ardour, in terms suitable
to his present appearance and situation: 'Tell me,' said he, 'have these
doors been open to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>? Has he obtained
possession of that treasure, which, by the voice of Heaven, has been
allotted to me?'</p>

<p><!-- Page 250 --><a name="Page_250"></a>To this double question, <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> answered by a single negative; and her
answer, therefore, was both false and true: it was true that her person
was still inviolate, and it was true also that <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> had not been admitted to her; yet her denial of it was false,
for she believed the contrary; <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> only
had been admitted, but she had received him as his brother. <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, however, was satisfied with the answer, and did
not discover its fallacy. He looked up to Heaven, with an expression of
gratitude and joy; and then turning to <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>, 'Swear then,' said he, 'that thou hast granted to <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, no pledge of thy love which should be
reserved for me.' <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, who now thought
nothing more than the asseveration necessary to quiet <!-- Page 251 --><a
name="Page_251"></a>his mind, immediately complied: 'I swear,' said she,
'that to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> I have given nothing, which
thou wouldst wish me to with-hold: the power that has devoted my person to
thee, has disunited my heart from <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
whom I renounce in thy presence for ever.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, whose fortitude and recollection
were again overborne, was thrown into an agitation of mind, which
discovered itself by looks and gestures very different from those which
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> had expected, and overwhelmed her
with new confusion and disappointment: that he, who had so lately
solicited her love with all the vehemence of a desire impatient to be
gratified, should now receive a declaration <!-- Page 252 --><a name=
"Page_252"></a>that she was ready to comply with marks of distress and
anger, was a mystery which she could not solve. In the mean time, the
struggle in his breast became every moment more violent: 'Where then,'
said he, 'is the constancy which you vowed to <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>; and for what instance of his love is he now forsaken?'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> was now more embarrassed than
before; she felt all the force of the reproof, supposing it to have been
given by <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>; and she could be
justified only by relating the particular, which at the expence of her
sincerity she had determined to conceal. <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> was now exalted in her opinion, while his form was animated
by the spirit of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; as much as
<!-- Page 253 --><a name="Page_253"></a><span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> had been degraded, while his form was animated by
the spirit of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>. In his resentment of
her perfidy to his rival, though it favoured his fondest and most ardent
wishes, there was an abhorrence of vice, and a generosity of mind, which
she supposed to have been incompatible with his character. To his
reproach, she could reply only by complaint; and could no otherwise evade
his question, than by observing the inconsistency of his own behaviour:
'Your words,' said she, 'are daggers to my heart. You condemn me for a
compliance with your own wishes; and for obedience to that voice, which
you supposed to have revealed the will of Heaven. Has the caprice of
desire already wandered to a new object? and do you <!-- Page 254 --><a
name="Page_254"></a>now seek a pretence to refuse, when it is freely
offered, what so lately you would have taken by force?'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who was now fired with resentment
against <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, whom yet he could not
behold without desire; and who, at the same moment, was impatient to
revenge his wrongs upon <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>; was
suddenly prompted to satisfy all his passions, by taking advantage of the
wiles of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, and the perfidy of <span
class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, to defeat the one and to punish the
other. It was now in his power instantly to consummate his marriage, as a
priest might be procured without a moment's delay, and as <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida's</span> consent was already given; he would then
obtain the possession of her person, by the very act <!-- Page 255 --><a
name="Page_255"></a>in which she perfidiously resigned it to his rival; to
whom he would then leave the beauties he had already possessed, and cast
from him in disdain, as united with a mind that he could never love. As
his imagination was fired with the first conception of this design, he
caught her to his breast with a fury, in which all the passions in all
their rage were at once concentered: 'Let the priest,' said he, 'instantly
unite us. Let us comprize, in one moment, in this instant, NOW, our whole
of being, and exclude alike the future and the past!' Then grasping her
still in his arms, he looked up to heaven: 'Ye powers,' said he,
'invisible but yet present, who mould my changing and unresisting form;
prolong, but for one hour, that <!-- Page 256 --><a name=
"Page_256"></a>mysterious charm, that is now upon me, and I will be ever
after subservient to your will!'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, who was terrified at the
furious ardor of this unintelligible address, shrunk from his embrace,
pale and trembling, without power to reply. <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> gazed tenderly upon her; and recollecting the purity and
tenderness with which he had loved her, his virtues suddenly recovered
their force; he dismissed her from his embrace; and turning from her, he
dropped in silence the tear that started to his eye, and expressed, in a
low and faultering voice, the thoughts that rushed upon his mind: 'No,'
said he; <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> shall still disdain the joy,
which is at once sordid and transient: <!-- Page 257 --><a name=
"Page_257"></a>in the breast of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, lust
shall not be the pander of revenge. Shall I, who have languished for the
pure delight which can arise only from the interchange of soul with soul,
and is endeared by mutual confidence and complacency; shall I snatch under
this disguise, which belies my features and degrades my virtue, a casual
possession of faithless beauty, which I despise and hate? Let this be the
portion of those, that hate me without a cause; but let this be far from
me!' At this thought, he felt a sudden elation of mind; and the conscious
dignity of virtue, that in such a conflict was victorious, rendered him,
in this glorious moment, superior to misfortune: his gesture became calm,
and his countenance sedate; he <!-- Page 258 --><a name=
"Page_258"></a>considered the wrongs he suffered, not as a sufferer, but
as a judge; and he determined at once to discover himself to <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>, and to reproach her with her crime. He
remarked her confusion without pity, as the effect not of grief but of
guilt; and fixing his eyes upon her, with the calm severity of a superior
and offended being, 'Such,' said he, 'is the benevolence of the Almighty
to the children of the dust, that our misfortunes are, like poisons,
antidotes to each other.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, whose faculties were now
suspended by wonder and expectation, looked earnestly at him, but
continued silent. 'Thy looks,' said <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
are full of wonder; but as yet thy wonder has no cause, in comparison
<!-- Page 259 --><a name="Page_259"></a>of that which shall be revealed.
Thou knowest the prodigy, which so lately parted <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>: I am that <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, thou art that <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>.' <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> would now have
interrupted him; but <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> raised his
voice, and demanded to be heard: 'At that moment,' said he, 'wretched as I
am, the child of error and disobedience, my heart repined in secret at the
destiny which had been written upon my head; for I then thought thee
faithful and constant: but if our hands had been then united, I should
have been more wretched than I am; for I now know that thou art fickle and
false. To know thee, though it has pierced my soul with sorrow, has yet
healed the wound which was inflicted when I lost thee: <!-- Page 260 --><a
name="Page_260"></a>and though I am now compelled to wear the form of
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, whose vices are this moment
disgracing mine, yet in the balance I shall be weighed as <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, and I shall suffer only as I am found
wanting.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, whose mind was now in a tumult
that bordered upon distraction, bewildered in a labyrinth of doubt and
wonder, and alike dreading the consequence of what she heard, whether it
was false or true, was yet impatient to confute or confirm it; and as soon
as she had recovered her speech, urged him for some token of the prodigy
he asserted, which he might easily have given, by relating any of the
incidents which themselves only could know. But just at this moment, <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, <!-- Page 261 --><a name=
"Page_261"></a>having at last disengaged himself from Osmyn, by whom he
had been long detained, resumed his own figure: and while the eyes of
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> were fixed upon <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, his powers were suddenly taken from him, and
restored in an instant; and she beheld the features of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> vanish, and gazed with astonishment upon his
own: 'Thy features change!' said she, 'and thou indeed art <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>.' 'The sudden trance,' said he, 'has restored me
to myself; and from my wrongs where shalt thou be hidden?' This reproach
was more than she could sustain, but he caught her as she was falling, and
supported her in his arms. This incident renewed in a moment all the
tenderness of his love: while he beheld her distress, and pressed her by
<!-- Page 262 --><a name="Page_262"></a>the embrace that sustained her to
his bosom, he forgot every injury which he supposed she had done him; and
perceived her recover with a pleasure, that for a moment suspended the
sense of his misfortunes.</p>

<p>Her first reflection was upon the snare, in which she had been taken;
and her first sensation was joy that she had escaped: she saw at once the
whole complication of events that had deceived and distressed her; and
nothing more was now necessary, than to explain them to <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>; which, however, she could not do, without
discovering the insincerity of her answers to the enquiries which he had
made, while she mistook him for his brother: 'If in my heart,' says she,
'thou hast <!-- Page 263 --><a name="Page_263"></a>found any virtue, let
it incline thee to pity the vice that is mingled with it: by the vice I
have been ensnared, but I have been delivered by the virtue. <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, for now I know that it was not thee, <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, when he possessed thy form, was with me:
he prophaned thy love, by attempts to supplant my virtue; I resisted his
importunity, and escaped perdition; but the guilt of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> drew my resentment upon <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>. I thought the vices which, under thy form, I
discovered in his bosom, were thine; and in the anguish of grief,
indignation, and disappointment, my heart renounced thee: yet, as I could
not give thee up to death, I could not discover to <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> the attempt which I imputed <!-- Page 264 --><a
name="Page_264"></a>to thee; when you questioned me, therefore, as <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, I was betrayed to dissimulation, by the
tenderness which still melted my heart for <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>.' 'I believe thee,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, catching her in a transport to his breast: 'I love thee for
thy virtue; and may the pure and exalted beings, who are superior to the
passions that now throb in my heart, forgive me, if I love thee also for
thy fault. Yet, let the danger to which it betrayed thee, teach us still
to walk in the strait path, and commit the keeping of our peace to the
Almighty; for he that wanders in the maze of falsehood, shall pass by the
good that he would meet, and shall meet the evil that he would shun. I
also was tempted; but I was strengthened <!-- Page 265 --><a name=
"Page_265"></a>to resist: if I had used the power, which I derived from
the arts that have been practised against me, to return evil for evil; if
I had not disdained a secret and unavowed revenge, and the unhallowed
pleasures of a brutal appetite; I might have possessed thee in the form of
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, and have wronged irreparably
myself and thee: for how could I have been admitted, as <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, to the beauties which I had enjoyed as <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>? and how couldst thou have given, to
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, what in reality had been
appropriated by <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>?'</p>

<p>But while <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> and <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> were thus congratulating each other upon the
evils which they had escaped, they were threatened by others, which,
however obvious, they had overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who was now exulting in the
prospect of success that had exceeded his hopes, and who supposed the
possession of <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> before the end of the
next hour, was as certain as that the next hour would arrive, suddenly
entered the apartment; but upon discovering <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, he started <!-- Page 267 --><a name="Page_267"></a>back
astonished and disappointed. <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> stood
unmoved; and regarded him with a fixed and steady look, that at once
reproached and confounded him. 'What treachery,' said <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'has been practised against me? What has
brought thee to this place; and how hast thou gained admittance?' 'Against
thy peace,' said <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, 'no treachery has
been practised, but by thyself. By those arts in which thy vices have
employed the powers of darkness, I have been brought hither; and by those
arts I have gained admittance: thy form which they have imposed upon me,
was my passport; and by the restoration of my own, I have detected and
disappointed the fraud, which the double change was produced to execute.
<!-- Page 268 --><a name="Page_268"></a><span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>, whom, as <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
thou couldst teach to hate thee, it is now impossible that, as <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, thou shouldst teach to love.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>, who perceived the storm to be
gathering which the next moment would burst upon the head of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, interposed between them, and addressed each of
them by turns; urging <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> to be silent,
and conjuring <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> to be merciful. <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, however, without regarding <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>, or making any reply to <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, struck the ground with his foot, and the
messengers of death, to whom the signal was familiar, appeared at the
door. <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> then commanded them to seize
his brother, with a countenance pale and livid, and a <!-- Page 269 --><a
name="Page_269"></a>voice that was broken by rage. <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> was still unmoved; but <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> threw herself at the feet of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, and embracing his knees was about to speak, but he broke
from her with sudden fury: 'If the world should sue,' said he, 'I would
spurn it off. There is no pang that cunning can invent, which he shall not
suffer: and when death at length shall disappoint my vengeance, his
mangled limbs shall be cast out unburied, to feed the beasts of the desert
and the fowls of heaven.' During this menace, <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span> sunk down without signs of life; and <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> struggling in vain for liberty to raise her from
the ground, she was carried off by some women who were called to her
assistance.</p>

<!-- Page 270 --><a name="Page_270"></a>

<p>In this awful crisis, <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who felt
his own fortitude give way, looked up, and though he conceived no words, a
prayer ascended from his heart to heaven, and was accepted by Him, to whom
our thoughts are known while they are yet afar off. For <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, the fountain of strength was opened from above;
his eye sparkled with confidence, and his breast was dilated by hope. He
commanded the guard that were leading him away to stop, and they
implicitly obeyed; he then stretched out his hand towards <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, whose spirit was rebuked before him: 'Hear
me,' said he, 'thou tyrant! for it is thy genius that speaks by my voice.
What has been the fruit of all thy guilt, but accumulated misery? What joy
hast thou <!-- Page 271 --><a name="Page_271"></a>derived from undivided
empire? what joy from the prohibition of my marriage with <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>? what good from that power, which some evil
daemon has added to thy own? what, at this moment, is thy portion, but
rage and anguish, disappointment, and despair? Even I, whom thou seest the
captive of thy power, whom thou hast wronged of empire, and yet more of
love; even I am happy, in comparison of thee. I know that my sufferings,
however multiplied, are short, for they shall end with life, and no life
is long: then shall the everlasting ages commence; and through everlasting
ages thy sufferings shall increase. The moment is now near, when thou
shalt tread that line which alone is the path to <!-- Page 272 --><a name=
"Page_272"></a>heaven, the narrow path that is stretched over the pit,
which smokes for ever, and for ever! When thine aking eye shall look
forward to the end that is far distant, and when behind thou shalt find no
retreat; when thy steps shall faulter, and thou shalt tremble at the depth
beneath, which thought itself is not able to fathom; then shall the angel
of distribution lift his inexorable hand against thee: from the irremeable
way shall thy feet be smitten; thou shalt plunge in the burning flood; and
though thou shalt live for ever, thou shalt rise no more.'</p>

<p>As the words of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> struck <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> with terror, and over-awed him by an
influence which he could not surmount; <!-- Page 273 --><a name=
"Page_273"></a><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was forced from his
presence, before any other orders had been given about him, than were
implied in the menace that was addressed to <span class="smallcaps">
Almeida</span>: no violence, therefore, was yet offered him; but he was
secured, till the king's pleasure should be known, in a dungeon not far
from the palace, to which he was conducted by a subterraneous passage; and
the door being closed upon him, he was left in silence, darkness, and
solitude, such as may be imagined before the voice of the Almighty
produced light and life.</p>

<p>When <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was sufficiently
recollected to consider his situation, he despaired of prevailing upon
<span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span> to gratify his wishes, till her
attachment to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was irreparably broken;
<!-- Page 274 --><a name="Page_274"></a>and he, therefore, resolved to put
him to death. With this view, he repeated the signal, which convened the
ministers of death to his presence; but the sound was lost in a peal of
thunder that instantly followed it, and the Genius, from whom he received
the talisman, again stood before him.</p>

<p>'<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,' said the Genius, 'I am now
compelled into thy presence by the command of a superior power; whom, if I
should dare to disobey, the energy of his will might drive me, in a
moment, beyond the limits of nature and the reach of thought, to spend
eternity alone, without comfort, and without hope.' 'And what,' said <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'is the will of this mighty and
tremendous being?' 'His <!-- Page 275 --><a name="Page_275"></a>will,'
said the Genius, 'I will reveal to thee. Hitherto, thou hast been enabled
to lift the rod of adversity against thy brother, by powers which nature
has not entrusted to man: as these powers, and these only, have put him
into thy hand, thou art forbidden to lift it against his life; if thou
hadst prevailed against him by thy own power, thy own power would not have
been restrained: to afflict him thou art still free; but thou art not
permitted to destroy. At the moment, in which thou shalt conceive a
thought to cut him off by violence, the punishment of thy disobedience
shall commence, and the pangs of death shall be upon thee.' 'If then,'
said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'this awful power is the
friend of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; what yet
<!-- Page 276 --><a name="Page_276"></a>remains, in the stores of thy
wisdom, for me? 'Till he dies, I am at once precluded from peace, and
safety, and enjoyment.' 'Look up,' said the Genius, 'for the iron hand of
despair is not yet upon thee. Thou canst be happy, only by his death; and
his life thou art forbidden to take away: yet mayst thou still arm him
against himself; and if he dies by his own hand, thy wishes will be full.'
'O name,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'but the means, and
it shall this moment be accomplished!' 'Select,' said the Genius, 'some
friend&mdash;'</p>

<p>At the name of friend, <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> started
and looked round in despair. He recollected the perfidy of Osmyn; and he
suspected that, from the same <!-- Page 277 --><a name=
"Page_277"></a>cause, all were perfidious: 'While <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> has yet life,' said he, 'I fear the face of man, as of a
savage that is prowling for his prey.' 'Relinquish not yet thy hopes,'
said the Genius; 'for one, in whom thou wilt joyfully confide, may be
found. Let him secretly obtain admittance to <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, as if by stealth; let him profess an abhorrence of thy
reign, and compassion for his misfortunes; let him pretend that the rack
is even now preparing for him; that death is inevitable, but that torment
may be avoided: let him then give him a poignard, as the instrument of
deliverance; and, perhaps, his own hand may strike the blow, that shall
give thee peace.' 'But who,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,
shall go upon this important <!-- Page 278 --><a name=
"Page_278"></a>errand?' 'Who,' replied the Genius, but thyself? Hast thou
not the power to assume the form of whomsoever thou wouldst have sent?' 'I
would have sent Osmyn,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'but
that I know him to be a traitor.' 'Let the form of Osmyn then,' said the
Genius, 'be thine. The shadows of the evening have now stretched
themselves upon the earth: command Osmyn to attend thee alone in the
grove, where Solyman, thy father, was used to meditate by night; and when
thy form shall be impressed upon him, I will there seal his eyes in sleep,
till the charm shall be broken; so shall no evil be attempted against
thee, and the transformation shall be known only to thyself.'</p>

<p><!-- Page 279 --><a name="Page_279"></a><span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, whose breast was again illuminated by hope,
was about to express his gratitude and joy; but the Genius suddenly
disappeared. He began, therefore, immediately to follow the instructions
that he had received: he commanded Osmyn to attend him in the grove, and
forbad every other to approach; by the power of the talisman he assumed
his appearance, and saw him sink down in the supernatural slumber before
him: he then quitted the place, and prepared to visit <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> in the prison.</p>

<h2>CHAP. XVIII.</h2>

<br />


<p>The officer who commanded the guard that kept the gate of the prison,
was Caled. He was now next in trust and power to Osmyn: but as he had
proposed a revolt to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, in which Osmyn
had refused to concur, he knew that his life was now in his power; he
dreaded lest, for some slight offence, or in some fit of causeless
displeasure, he should disclose the secret to <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, who would then certainly condemn him to death. To secure
this fatal secret, and put an end to his inquietude, he resolved,
<!-- Page 281 --><a name="Page_281"></a>from the moment that <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> was established upon the throne, to find some
opportunity secretly to destroy Osmyn: in this resolution, he was
confirmed by the enmity, which inferior minds never fail to conceive
against that merit, which they cannot but envy without spirit to emulate,
and by which they feel themselves disgraced without an effort to acquire
equal honour; it was confirmed also by the hope which Caled had conceived,
that, upon the death of Osmyn, he should succeed to his post: his
apprehensions likewise were increased, by the gloom which he remarked in
the countenance of Osmyn; and which not knowing that it arose from fear,
he imputed to jealousy and malevolence.</p>

<p><!-- Page 282 --><a name="Page_282"></a>When <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, who had now assumed the appearance of Osmyn, had passed
the subterranean avenue to the dungeon in which <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> was confined, he was met by Caled; of whom he demanded
admittance to the prince, and produced his own signet, as a testimony that
he came with the authority of the king. As it was Caled's interest to
secure the favour of Osmyn till an opportunity should offer to cut him
off, he received him with every possible mark of respect and reverence;
and when he was gone into the dungeon, he commanded a beverage to be
prepared for him against he should return, in which such spices were
infused, as might expel the malignity which, in that place, might be
received with the breath of life; and taking himself the
<!-- Page 283 --><a name="Page_283"></a>key of the prison, he waited at
the door.</p>

<p>When <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> entered the dungeon, with a
lamp which he had received from Caled, he found <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> sitting upon the ground: his countenance was impressed with
the characters of grief; but it retained no marks either of anger or fear.
When he looked up, and saw the features of Osmyn, he judged that the mutes
were behind him; and, therefore, rose up, to prepare himself for death.
<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> beheld his calmness and fortitude
with the involuntary praise of admiration; yet persisted in his purpose
without remorse. 'I am come,' said he, by the command of <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, to denounce that fate, the bitterness of
<!-- Page 284 --><a name="Page_284"></a>which I will enable thee to
avoid.' 'And what is there,' said <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
'in my fortunes, that has prompted thee to the danger of this attempt?'
'The utmost that I can give thee,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, 'I can give thee without danger to myself: but though I
have been placed, by the hand of fortune, near the person of the tyrant,
yet has my heart in secret been thy friend. If I am the messenger of evil,
impute it to him only by whom it is devised. The rack is now preparing to
receive thee; and every art of ingenious cruelty will be exhausted to
protract and to increase the agonies of death.' 'And what,' said <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, 'can thy friendship offer me?' 'I can
offer thee,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'that which will
at once dismiss <!-- Page 285 --><a name="Page_285"></a>thee to those
regions, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary rest for
ever.' He then produced the poignard from his bosom; and presenting it to
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, 'Take this,' said he, 'and sleep in
peace.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, whose heart was touched with
sudden joy at the sight of so unexpected a remedy for every evil, did not
immediately reflect, that he was not at liberty to apply it: he snatched
it in a transport from the hand of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,
and expressed his sense of the obligation by clasping him in his arms, and
shedding the tears of gratitude in his breast. 'Be quick,' said <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>: this moment I must leave thee; and in
the next, perhaps, the messengers of destruction may bind thee to the
<!-- Page 286 --><a name="Page_286"></a>rack. 'I will be quick,' said
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; 'and the sigh that shall last linger
upon my lips, shall bless thee.' They then bid each other farewel: <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> retired from the dungeon, and the door
was again closed upon <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>.</p>

<p>Caled, who waited at the door till the supposed Osmyn should return,
presented him with the beverage which he had prepared, of which he
recounted the virtues; and <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> received
it with pleasure, and having eagerly drank it off, returned to the palace.
As soon as he was alone, he resumed his own figure, and fate, with a
confident and impatient expectation, that in a short time a messenger
would be dispatched to acquaint him with the death <!-- Page 287 --><a
name="Page_287"></a>of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>. <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, in the mean time, having grasped the dagger in
his hand, and raised his arm for the blow, 'This,' said he, 'is my
passport to the realms of peace, the immediate and only object of my
hope!' But at these words, his mind instantly took the alarm: 'Let me
reflect,' said he, 'a moment: from what can I derive hope in
death?&mdash;from that patient and persevering virtue, and from that
alone, by which we fulfill the task that is assigned us upon the earth. Is
it not our duty, to suffer, as well as to act? If my own hand consigns me
to the grave, what can it do but perpetuate that misery, which, by
disobedience, I would shun? what can it do, but cut off my life and hope
together?' With this reflection <!-- Page 288 --><a name="Page_288"></a>he
threw the dagger from him; and stretching himself again upon the ground,
resigned himself to the disposal of the Father of man, most Merciful and
Almighty.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who had now resolved to send
for the intelligence which he longed to hear, was dispatching a messenger
to the prison, when he was told that Caled desired admittance to his
presence. At the name of Caled, he started up in an extasy of joy; and not
doubting but that <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> was dead, he
ordered him to be instantly admitted. When he came in, <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> made no enquiry about <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, because he would not appear to expect the event, which yet
he supposed he had brought about; he, therefore, <!-- Page 289 --><a name=
"Page_289"></a>asked him only upon what business he came. 'I come, my
lord,' said he, 'to apprize thee of the treachery of Osmyn.' 'I know,'
said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'that Osmyn is a traitor; but
of what dost thou accuse him? 'As I was but now,' said he, 'changing the
guard which is set upon <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, Osmyn came
up to the door of the prison, and producing the royal signet demanded
admittance. As the command which I received, when he was delivered to my
custody, was absolute, that no foot should enter, I doubted whether the
token had not been obtained, by fraud, for some other purpose; yet, as he
required admittance only, I complied: but that if any treachery had been
contrived, I might detect it; and that no artifice <!-- Page 290 --><a
name="Page_290"></a>might be practised to favour an escape; I waited
myself at the door, and listening to their discourse I overheard the
treason that I suspected.' 'What then,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, 'didst thou hear?' 'A part of what was said,' replied
Caled, 'escaped me: but I heard Osmyn, like a perfidious and presumptuous
slave, call <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> a tyrant; I heard him
profess an inviolable friendship for <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
and assure him of deliverance. What were the means, I know not; but he
talked of speed, and supposed that the effect was certain.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, though he was still impatient
to hear of <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>; and discovered, that if
he was dead, his death was unknown to Caled; was yet <!-- Page 291 --><a
name="Page_291"></a>notwithstanding rejoiced at what he heard: and as he
knew what Caled told him to be true, as the conversation he related had
passed between himself and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, he
exulted in the pleasing confidence that he had yet a friend; the glooms of
suspicion, which had involved his mind, were dissipated, and his
countenance brightened with complacency and joy. He had delayed to put
Osmyn to death, only because he could appoint no man to succeed him, of
whom his fears did not render him equally suspicious: but having now
found, in Caled, a friend, whose fidelity had been approved when there had
been no intention to try it; and being impatient to reward his zeal, and
to invest his fidelity with that power, which would render his services
most <!-- Page 292 --><a name="Page_292"></a>important; he took a ring
from his own finger, and putting it upon that of Caled, 'Take this,' said
he, 'as a pledge, that to-morrow Osmyn shall lose his head; and that, from
this moment, thou art invested with his power.'</p>

<p>Caled having, in the conversation between <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, discerned
indubitable treachery, which he imputed to Osmyn whose appearance <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had then assumed, eagerly seized the
opportunity to destroy him; he, therefore, not trusting to the event of
his accusation, had mingled poison in the bowl which he presented to <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> when he came out from <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>: this, however, at first he had resolved to
conceal.</p>

<p><!-- Page 293 --><a name="Page_293"></a>In consequence of his
accusation, he supposed Osmyn would be questioned upon the rack; he
supposed also, that the accusation, as it was true, would be confirmed by
his confession; that what ever he should then say to the prejudice of his
accuser, would be disbelieved; and that when after a few hours the poison
should take effect, no inquisition would be made into the death of a
criminal, whom the bow-string or the scimitar would otherwise have been
employed to destroy. But he now hoped to derive new merit from an act of
zeal, which <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had approved before it
was known, by condemning his rival to die, whose death he had already
insured: 'May the wishes of my lord,' said he, 'be always anticipated; and
may it be <!-- Page 294 --><a name="Page_294"></a>found, that whatever he
ordains is already done: may he accept the zeal of his servant, whom he
has delighted to honour; for, before the light of the morning shall
return, the eyes of Osmyn shall close in everlasting darkness.'</p>

<p>At these words, the countenance of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> changed; his cheeks became pale, and his lips trembled:
'What then,' said he, 'hast thou done?' Caled, who was terrified and
astonished, threw himself upon the ground, and was unable to reply. <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who now, by the utmost effort of his
mind, restrained his confusion and his fear, that he might learn the truth
from Caled without dissimulation or disguise, raised him from the
<!-- Page 295 --><a name="Page_295"></a>ground and repeated his enquiry.
'If I have erred,' said Caled, 'impute it not: when I had detected the
treachery of Osmyn, I was transported by my zeal for thee. For proof that
he is guilty, I appeal now to himself; for he yet lives: but that he might
not escape the hand of justice, I mingled, in the bowl I give him, the
drugs of death.'</p>

<p>At these words, <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, striking his
hands together, looked upward in an agony of despair and horror, and fell
back upon a sofa that was behind him. Caled, whose astonishment was equal
to his disappointment and his fears, approached him with a trembling
though hasty pace; but as he stooped to support him, <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span> <!-- Page 296 --><a name=
"Page_296"></a>suddenly drew his dagger and stabbed him to the heart; and
repeated the blow with reproaches and execrations, till his strength
failed him.</p>

<p>In this dreadful moment, the Genius once more appeared before him; at
the sight of whom he waved his hand, but was unable to speak. 'Nothing,'
said the Genius, 'that has happened to <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, is hidden from me. Thy peace has been destroyed alike by
the defection of Osmyn, and by the zeal of Caled: thy life may yet be
preserved; but it can be preserved only by a charm, which <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> must apply.' <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, who had raised his eyes, and conceived some languid hope,
when he heard that he might yet <!-- Page 297 --><a name=
"Page_297"></a>live; cast them again down in despair, when he heard that
he could receive life only from <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>.
'From <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,' said he, 'I have already
taken the power to save me; I have, by thy counsel, given him the
instrument of death, which, by thy counsel also, I urged him to use: he
received it with joy, and he is now doubtless numbered with the dead.'
'<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,' said the Genius, 'is not dead; but
from the fountain of virtue he drinks life and peace. If what I shall
propose, he refuses to perform, not all the powers of earth, and sea, and
air, if they should combine, can give thee life: but if he complies, the
death, that is now suspended over thee, shall fall upon his head; and thy
life shall be again delivered <!-- Page 298 --><a name="Page_298"></a>to
the hand of time.' 'Make haste then,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, 'and I will here wait the event.' 'The event,' said the
Genius, 'is not distant; and it is the last experiment which my power can
make, either upon him or thee: when the star of the night, that is now
near the horizon, shall set, I will be with him.'</p>

<p>When <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> was alone, he reflected,
that every act of supernatural power which the Genius had enabled him to
perform, had brought upon him some new calamity, though it always promised
him some new advantage. As he would not impute this disappointment to the
purposes for which he employed the power that he had received, he indulged
a suspicion, that it proceeded <!-- Page 299 --><a name=
"Page_299"></a>from the perfidy of the Being by whom it was bestowed; in
his mind, therefore, he thus reasoned with himself: 'The Genius, who has
pretended to be the friend of <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, has
been secretly in confederacy with <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>:
why else do I yet sigh in vain for <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>?
and why else did not <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> perish, when his
life was in my power? By his counsel, I persuaded <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span> to destroy himself; and, in the very act, I was betrayed to
drink the potion, by which I shall be destroyed: I have been led on, from
misery to misery, by ineffectual expedients, and fallacious hopes. In this
crisis of my fate, I will not trust, with implicit confidence, in another:
I will be present at the interview of this powerful, but suspected Being,
<!-- Page 300 --><a name="Page_300"></a>with <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>; and who can tell, but that if I detect a fraud, I may be
able to disappoint it: however powerful, he is not omniscient; I may,
therefore, be present, unknown and unsuspected even by him, in a form that
I can chuse by a thought, to which he cannot be conscious.'</p>

<h2>CHAP. XIX.</h2>

<br />


<p>In consequence of this resolution, <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, having commanded one of the soldiers of the guard that
attended upon <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> into an inner room of
the palace, he ordered him to wait there till his return: then making fast
the door, he assumed his figure, and went immediately to the dungeon;
where producing his signet, he said, he had received orders from the king
to remain with the prisoner, till the watch expired.</p>

<!-- Page 302 --><a name="Page_302"></a>

<p>As he entered without speaking, and without a light, <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> continued stretched upon the ground, with his
face towards the earth; and <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, having
silently retired to a remote corner of the place, waited for the
appearance of the Genius.</p>

<p>The dawn of the morning now broke; and, in a few minutes, the prison
shook, and the Genius appeared. He was visible by a lambent light that
played around him; and <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> starting from
the ground, turned to the vision with reverence and wonder: but as the
Omnipotent was ever present to his mind, to whom all beings in all worlds
are obedient, and on whom alone he relied for protection, he was neither
confused nor afraid. '<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,' said
<!-- Page 303 --><a name="Page_303"></a>the Genius, 'the crisis of thy
fate is near.' 'Who art thou,' said <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>,
and for what purpose art thou come?' 'I am,' replied the Genius, 'an
inhabitant of the world above thee; and to the will of thy brother, my
powers have been obedient: upon him they have not conferred happiness, but
they have brought evil upon thee. It was my voice, that forbad thy
marriage with <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>; and my voice, that
decreed the throne to <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>: I gave him
the power to assume thy form; and, by me, the hand of oppression is now
heavy upon thee. Yet I have not decreed, that he should be happy, nor that
thou shouldst be wretched: darkness as yet rests upon my purpose; but my
heart in secret is thy friend.' 'If <!-- Page 304 --><a name=
"Page_304"></a>thou art, indeed my friend,' said <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, 'deliver me from this prison; and preserve <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> for <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>.' Thy
deliverance,' said the Genius, must depend upon thyself. There is a charm,
of which the power is great; but it is by thy will only, that this power
can be exerted.'</p>

<p>The Genius then held out towards him a scroll, on which the seal of
seven powers was impressed. 'Take, said he, 'this scroll, in which the
mysterious name of Orosmades is written. Invoke the spirits, that reside
westward from the rising of the sun; and northward, in the regions of cold
and darkness: then stretch out thy hand, and a lamp of sulphur, self
kindled, shall burn before thee. In the fire of this lamp, consume that
<!-- Page 305 --><a name="Page_305"></a>which I now give thee; and as the
smoke, into which it changes, shall mix with the air, a mighty charm shall
be formed, which shall defend thee from all mischief: from that instant no
poison, however potent, can hurt thee; nor shall any prison confine: in
one moment, thou shalt be restored to the throne, and to <span class=
"smallcaps">Almeida</span>; and the Angel of death, shall lay his hand
upon thy brother; to whom, if I had confided this last best effort of my
power, he would have secured the good to himself, and have transferred the
evil to thee.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who had listened unseen to this
address of the Genius to <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, was now
confirmed in his suspicions, that evil had been ultimately intended
against him; and that he had <!-- Page 306 --><a name="Page_306"></a>been
entangled in the toils of perfidy, while he believed himself to be
assisted by the efforts of friendship: he was also convinced, that by the
Genius he was not known to be present. <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, however, flood still doubtful, and <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> was kept silent by his fears. 'Whoever thou art,' said
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, the condition of the advantages
which thou hast offered me, is such as it is not lawful to fulfill: these
horrid rites, and this commerce with unholy powers, are prohibited to
mortals in the Law of life.' 'See thou to that,' said the Genius: 'Good
and evil are before thee; that which I now offer thee, I will offer no
more.'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who had not fortitude to give up
at once the possibility of securing <!-- Page 307 --><a name=
"Page_307"></a>the advantages that had been offered, and who was seduced
by human frailty to deliberate at least upon the choice; stretched out his
hand, and receiving the scroll, the Genius instantly disappeared. That
which had been proposed as a trial of his virtue, <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span> believed indeed to be an offer of advantage; he had no
hope, therefore, but that <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> would
refuse the conditions, and that he should be able to obtain the talisman,
and fulfill them himself: he judged that the mind of <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> was in suspense, and was doubtful to which side
it might finally incline; he, therefore, instantly assumed the voice and
the person of <span class="smallcaps">Omar</span>, that by the influence
of his council he might be able to turn the scale.</p>

<p><!-- Page 308 --><a name="Page_308"></a>When the change was effected,
he called <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> by his name; and <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who knew the voice, answered him in a
transport of joy and wonder: 'My friend,' said he, 'my father! in this
dreary solitude, in this hour of trial, thou art welcome to my soul as
liberty and life! Guide me to thee by thy voice; and tell while I hold
thee to my bosom, how and wherefore thou art come?' 'Do not now ask me,'
said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>: 'it is enough that I am here;
and that I am permitted to warn thee of the precipice, on which thou
standest. It is enough, that concealed in this darkness, I have overheard
the specious guile, which some evil demon has practised upon thee.' 'Is it
then certain,' said <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, 'that
<!-- Page 309 --><a name="Page_309"></a>this being is evil?' 'Is not that
being evil, said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,' 'who proposes
evil, as the condition of good?' 'Shall I then,' said <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, 'renounce my liberty and life? The rack is now
ready; and, perhaps, the next moment, its tortures will be inevitable.'
'Let me ask thee then,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, 'to
preserve thy life, wilt thou destroy thy soul?' 'O! stay,' said <span
class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>&mdash;'Let me not be tried too far! Let the
strength of Him who is Almighty, be manifest in my weakness!' <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span> then paused a few moments; but he was no longer
in doubt: and <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who disbelieved and
despised the arguments, by which he intended to persuade him to renounce
what, upon the same condition, he was impatient to secure for
<!-- Page 310 --><a name="Page_310"></a>himself, conceived hopes that he
should succeed; and those hopes were instantly confirmed.' 'Take then,'
said <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, this unholy charm; and remove
it far from me, as the sands of Alai from the trees of Oman; lest, in some
dreadful hour, my virtue may fail me, and thy counsel may be wanting!'
'Give it me then,' said <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>; and
feeling for the hands of each other, he snatched it from him in an extasy
of joy, and instantly resuming his own voice and figure, he cried out, 'At
length I have prevailed: and life and love, dominion and revenge, are now
at once in my hand!'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span> heard and knew the voice of his
brother, with astonishment; but it was too late to wish that he had
withheld <!-- Page 311 --><a name="Page_311"></a>the charm, which his
virtue would not permit him to use. 'Yet a few moments pass,' said <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, and thou art nothing.' <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, who doubted not of the power of the talisman,
and knew that <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> had no principles
which would restrain him from using it to his destruction, resigned
himself to death, with a sacred joy that he had escaped from guilt. <span
class="smallcaps">Almoran</span> then, with an elation of mind that
sparkled in his eyes, and glowed upon his cheek, stretched out his hand,
in which he held the scroll; and a lamp of burning sulphur was immediately
suspended in the air before him: he held the mysterious writing in the
flame; and as it began to burn, the place shook with reiterated thunder,
of which every peal was more terrible and more <!-- Page 312 --><a name=
"Page_312"></a>loud. <span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, wrapping his
robe round him, cried out, 'In the Fountain of Life that flows for ever,
let my life be mingled! Let me not be, as if I had never been; but still
conscious of my being, let me still glorify Him from whom it is derived,
and be still happy in his love!'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who was absorbed in the
anticipation of his own felicity, heard the thunder without dread, as the
proclamation of his triumph: 'Let thy hopes,' said he, 'be thy portion;
and the pleasures that I have secured, shall be mine.' As he pronounced
these words, he started as at a sudden pang; his eyes became fixed, and
his posture immoveable; yet his senses still remained, and he perceived
<!-- Page 313 --><a name="Page_313"></a>the Genius once more to stand
before him. '<span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>,' said he, 'to the
last sounds which thou shalt hear, let thine ear be attentive! Of the
spirits that rejoice to fulfill the purpose of the Almighty, I am one. To
<span class="smallcaps">Hamet</span>, and to <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, I have been commissioned from above: I have been appointed
to perfect virtue, by adversity; and in the folly of her own projects, to
entangle vice. The charm, which could be formed only by guilt, has power
only to produce misery: of every good, which thou, <span class=
"smallcaps">Almoran</span>, wouldst have secured by disobedience, the
opposite evil is thy portion; and of every evil, which thou, <span class=
"smallcaps">Hamet</span>, wast, by Obedience, willing to incur, the
opposite good is bestowed upon thee. To thee, <span class="smallcaps">
Hamet</span>, <!-- Page 314 --><a name="Page_314"></a>are now given the
throne of thy father, and <span class="smallcaps">Almeida</span>. And
thou, <span class="smallcaps">Almoran</span>, who, while I speak, art
incorporating with the earth, shalt remain, through all generations, a
memorial of the truths which thy life has taught!'</p>

<p>At the words of the Genius, the earth trembled beneath, and above the
walls of the prison disappeared: the figure of <span class="smallcaps">
Almoran</span>, which was hardened into stone, expanded by degrees; and a
rock, by which his form and attitude are still rudely expressed, became at
once a monument of his punishment and his guilt.</p>

<p>Such are the events recorded by <span class="smallcaps">Acmet</span>,
the descendant of the Prophet, <!-- Page 315 --><a name="Page_315"></a>and
the preacher of righteousness! for, to <span class="smallcaps">
Acmet</span>, that which passed in secret was revealed by the Angel of
instruction, that the world might know, that, to the wicked, increase of
power is increase of wretchedness; and that those who condemn the folly of
an attempt to defeat the purpose of a Genius, might no longer hope to
elude the appointment of the Most High.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
