<h3>CHARIVARIA.</h3>
<p>A Fellow of the Royal Society states that, as a result of radium
activity, the end of the world, which had been estimated to arrive
in a few thousand years, may be postponed for a million aeons. It
is hoped that this will allay the anxiety of those soldiers who
were nervous about their chances of being demobilized.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is reported that when asked his impression of President
WILSON Mr. BALFOUR remarked, "Gee! He's the top shout and the main
squeeze. And then some."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"How much water," asks a technical journal, "does it take to
make a gallon of Government ale?" We do not profess to be expert,
but we should say about a gallon.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There is no truth in the rumour that TROTSKY has written to
President WILSON offering to execute the Peace Conference at any
time within the next three months at half the usual rates.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A case which has been puzzling the medical authorities is
reported from Warwickshire. After acting strangely for several days
a boy named TOMMY SMITH asked his parents if he could have rice
pudding instead.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Great Britain," says an essayist, "has come out of the war with
flying colours." No blame, we understand, attaches to Mr. PHILIP
SNOWDEN for this.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A large marrow has been washed ashore at Lowestoft bearing a
name and address and the words, "Please write." It is not known why
the marrow left home.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A report comes from Berlin that Dr. SOLF has resigned. It is
expected that he will be succeeded by Dr. SOLF.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The greengrocer who deliberately attempted to spoil President
WILSON'S welcome by exhibiting American apples for sale on Boxing
Day is suspected of being a naturalised German.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A North of England widower would like to meet lady possessing in
her own right a bottle of whisky. Object, matrimony.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The largely increased number of unemployed politicians is
causing the country great concern.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Heavy falls of snow have occurred in the Midlands, where the
people say they have not had such a winter since last summer.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Described as the tallest soldier in Ireland, MICHAEL GRADY, of
County Mayo, who is seven feet two inches in height, hopes to
settle down on a farm. It is expected that he will shortly be
measured for a village.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"To improve the appetite," says a Health Culture journal, "one
should salute the morn by throwing open the windows, lay on the
bedroom floor with the feet in the air and breathe deeply." This
method of saluting is not recommended to recruits.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The latest Sunday newspaper reminds us that it prints all the
news. It must do better than this if it is to keep pace with some
of our contemporaries.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Charged at Carmarthen with bigamy a soldier said he had no
recollection of his second marriage. Once again we feel compelled
to point out the advantage of keeping a diary.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It appears that one burglar has claimed his discharge from the
Army on the ground that he is a pivotal man and that several
policemen are waiting for him.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is wrong to suppose, says the Coal Control Department, that
anthracite is injurious to health. The little ones all declare that
its flavour compares favourably with that of Brazil nuts.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Three cases of mince-pie shock are reported from the Westbourne
Grove district.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A woman has been fined ten shillings at Birmingham for putting
cold tea in bottles and selling it as whisky. One of the
purchasers, it appears, had his suspicions aroused by the peculiar
taste of the liquid.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The KAISER'S health, says a contemporary, is still a cause of
anxiety.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER HISTORIC INTERVIEW.</h3>
<br />
<br />
<h5>BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.</h5>
<p><i>Incited to great efforts by the interview in "The Times" with
President WILSON, wherein so much is said (by the interviewer), Mr.
Punch sent forth one of his most energetic and Napoleonic young men
to attempt a similarly incredible feat and obtain an interview with
that most unapproachable of men&mdash;President not
excluded&mdash;the Editor of "The Times." The word "failure" being
absent from the Bouverie Street lexicon, it follows that the
impossible was achieved, and the electrifying result is printed
below. In the wish that readers in vaster numbers than usual may
peruse the winged words of the illustrious journalist, Mr. Punch
offers the freedom of the article to all editors the world
over.</i></p>
<p>The office of <i>The Times</i> is situated in a busy quarter of
the great city of London and is built of brick and stone. Light
enters the numerous rooms through windows made of glass. Outside is
the roar of traffic; inside, the presses groan, not always without
reason.</p>
<p>My appointment with the august and retiring controller of the
great English journal&mdash;the Jupiter who directs its
thunderbolts, determines the size of type appropriate to every
correspondent, and latterly has added to the gaiety of nations by
offering a tilting-space to the ATTORNEY-GENERAL and Mr. GIBSON
BOWLES&mdash;my appointment being at three o'clock I was careful to
reach the office a few minutes before that hour, because I like to
have time to look around and collect those little details of
environment and atmosphere which are so valuable in themselves as
to make it almost immaterial whether the person I am to interview
speaks at all.</p>
<p>Entering the offices, which can be described only as palatial, I
was struck by the thoughtfulness&mdash;no doubt appertaining to the
head of the establishment who was so soon, for the first time in
history, to grant me an audience&mdash;which had provided a
parallelogram of some fibrous material for the purpose of removing
the mud from one's boots. A minute later I was again delighted by
the discovery of an ingenious contrivance in the shape of a kind of
peg or hook on which a hat and coat could be placed. It is by just
such minutiae as these that one place is distinguished from another
and character indicated.</p>
<p>Punctually to the minute I was shown into the Editor's room,
where again I was struck by the imaginative adequacy of the
surroundings. Before coming to the man himself let me say something
of these. The floor was not bare or even sprinkled with sawdust, as
it might easily have been, but it was covered by a comfortable
carpet, probably from Axminster. Comfort was indeed the note. The
desk was neither pitch pine nor teak, but mahogany. Upon it were
scattered papers&mdash;lightly scattered, although no doubt each
was of the most momentous, even tragical import, some bearing the
signatures of the most eminent publicists in the land. Yet, such is
the domination of this man, they lay there like circulars or
election addresses. In the ink-pot was ink. A date rack was proof
that the Editor is not superior to the artificial divisions of
time.</p>
<p>As I entered, his back was towards me, but none the less I was
conscious of power, distinction, a man apart. I have seen many
backs, but none more notable than this. Turning he revealed to the
full the wonder and mystery of his famous frown&mdash;the frown of
Jupiter Tonans. Much has been said of this frown, but since no
analysis has yet appeared in print I must be permitted to offer
one. To begin with, the frown is not only on his face, but (one
instinctively knows) all over him. It suffuses him. Could one see,
for instance, his knee, one is sure that it would be frowning
too.</p>
<p>The effect was terrifying, but I stood my ground. As for the
face, where the frown concentrates, it is most curiously divided.
Below the masterful nose the frown may be said to be merely
threatening; above the firm upper lip it assumes a quality of such
dourness as to resemble a scowl. The forehead is corrugated. The
ears twitch, especially the left. The eyes emit sparks.</p>
<p>Hitherto he had not spoken; but now he began to unburden himself
of those opinions, hopes, fancies and idealistic meditations for
which I had come so far to see him. In order that there shall be no
ambiguity I have arranged for them to be set up in larger type than
the rest of the article. After all, any type will suit my own poor
setting, but the jewels, the jewels must be seen.</p>
<p>"Be seated, pray," he said. "The world," he added after a long
silence, "is in an unusual state. The Versailles Conferences may
effect great changes."</p>
<p>"Everyone hopes," he remarked after another pause, "that the
weather will improve; recently it has been far from
invigorating."</p>
<p>I give his exact words with scrupulous minuteness.</p>
<p>"A permanent peace," he continued, "based upon equity, cannot
but be desired. The Election results," he added as an afterthought,
"are interesting."</p>
<p>Asked what he thought of the PRIME MINISTER, he pondered deeply
for a while and then replied, in carefully measured tones, "I think
him an exceptional man."</p>
<p>Pressed as to the League of Nations, he considered the matter
for some minutes and then said, "It is a fine notion. We might all
be the happier if it came."</p>
<p>My time being now up he bowed me to the door and the interview
was over. The knob was of brass and had been, recently
polished.</p>
<p>His last words were, "Mind the step."</p>

<h3>THE ANTI-PICADORS.</h3>
<p>A conference of subscribers and contributors to the
correspondence columns of <i>The Times</i> was held at Caxton Hall
on Saturday last, to discuss the situation created in the issue of
December 21st by the printing of the interview with President
WILSON in larger type than had ever been used previously in the
body of the paper. Amongst those present were "Scrutator," "Bis Dat
Qui Cito Dat," "Judex," "Vindex," "Palmam Qui Meruit Ferat,"
"Rusticus Expectans," "Old Etonian," "Anxious Parent,"
"Anti-Jacobin," "Puzzled," "Octogenarian," "Quousque Tandem," and
"The Thin End of the Wedge."</p>
<p>The Chair was taken by a "Subscriber of Fifty Years' Standing,"
who prefaced his remarks by observing that neither he nor any of
those present was animated by the faintest antagonism to President
WILSON. Their gratitude to him for his services in the War was so
great that, in the abstract, they could have no objection to his
being accorded the distinction of the largest possible type, so
long as proper distinction was made typographically between the
remarks of the PRESIDENT and the comments of the
interviewer&mdash;as for example that Mr. WILSON's bedroom is
"strictly First Empire," or that "there seems to be some kind of
competition between the upper and the lower halves of his
features," or that his "grey lounge suit" was "well cut into his
body." But there ought to be some harmony between the size of the
type and the importance of the views expressed. He had himself
contributed many letters to <i>The Times</i> on subjects of the
greatest urgency, but had never attained the dignity even of long
primer. (Sensation.) He thought that in the circumstances they were
entitled to address a modest protest to the Editor, to the effect
that the use of "pica" should be reserved for the rarest occasions
and not be allowed to prejudice the claims of those who were
entitled to exercise the indefeasible privilege of "writing to
<i>The Times</i>." (Cheers.)</p>
<p>"Scrutator," who followed, disclaimed any personal grievance.
His letters had always appeared in large type and on the best
pages. But he drew the line at "pica"; it looked too like an
advertisement and destroyed the balance of the page. In old days an
editor controlled the "make-up" of his paper. Now he was at the
mercy of his "maker-up."</p>
<p>"Judex," speaking from the body of the hall, said that he had
heard the interview in question spoken of as a "splendid scoop." He
was not certain what the phrase meant, but he did not like the
sound of it, and dreaded the prospect of President WILSON being
made the subject of a typographical competition between our daily
papers. While the paper shortage lasted this might lead to very
serious results in the way of restricting the space available for
the ventilation of the views of those present.</p>
<p>An "Anxious Parent" pointed out that the use of "pica" was
unfortunate, as it irresistibly suggested "picador," one who
participated in a cruel sport, whereas President WILSON was a most
humane and compassionate man and had never assisted at a
bull-fight.</p>
<p>After several other speeches it was ultimately resolved to form
an association, to be known as the "Anti-Picador League," and a
small committee was appointed to draw up an appeal to the principal
Editors to abstain as far as possible from typographical
Jumbomania.</p>

<h3>BOY (SECOND CLASS).</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>BOY (Second Class) John Simpkins, a bad 'un, you must know,</p>
<p>Was told to swab a plank one day by a First-Class C.P.O.,</p>
<p>Whose eagle eye, returning, on the deck espied a
stain&mdash;</p>
<p>"Boy Simpkins, fetch your mop, me lad, and swab yon plank
again."</p>
<p>Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!) made as though he wouldn't
go,</p>
<p>And distinctly muttered "Blast you!" to that First-Class
C.P.O.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The splendid Petty Officer fell flat upon the deck;</p>
<p>They bore him to the Sick Bay just a weak and worthless
wreck;</p>
<p>But an A.B. who was standing by had caught the wicked word</p>
<p>And told the Duty Officer exactly what occurred:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!), which I think yer oughter
know, Sir,</p>
<p>'Ad the lip ter mutter 'Blast you!' ter the Fust-Class C.P.O.,
Sir."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>There is silence in the foc's'le, on the quarter-deck
dismay,</p>
<p>And the lower deck is humming in a most unusual way;</p>
<p>The working-party pauses as it cleans a six-inch gun,</p>
<p>And the Officer on Duty whispers hoarse to "Number
One":&mdash;</p>
<p>"Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!), I suppose you ought to know,
Sir,</p>
<p>Had the cheek to mutter 'Blast you!' to a First-Class C.P.O.,
Sir."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Number One, his face is ashen and his knees knock as he runs</p>
<p>(A curious phenomenon quite rare in Number Ones);</p>
<p>But on he rushed until he saw the tall brass-hatted Bloke,</p>
<p>And, nervously saluting, incoherently he spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!), I'm afraid that you must
know, Sir,</p>
<p>Had the nerve to mutter 'Blast you!' to a First-Class C.P.O.,
Sir."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The Bloke turned blue and shivered, then hysterically
laughed,</p>
<p>And hurried, cackling shrilly, to the Owner's cabin aft;</p>
<p>There in that awful presence, with lips aghast and pale,</p>
<p>To the horror-haunted Owner he re-told the horrid
tale:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!), I regret to let you know,
Sir,</p>
<p>Had the face to mutter 'Blast you!' to a First-Class C.P.O.,
Sir!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>You could almost hear the silence when the flags began to
flap</p>
<p>And the Captain made the signal that destroyed the Admiral's
nap;</p>
<p>And though I wasn't there myself beside the great man's bed</p>
<p>You all can guess as well as I just what the Owner
said:&mdash;"SUBMITTED.</p>

<h3>NOVEL RECONSTRUCTION.</h3>
<p>Simmons is a writer of fiction and was a friend of mine.</p>
<p>I used to play billiards with Simmons, to talk to Simmons, but
not to read Simmons.</p>
<p>There are limits to friendship.</p>
<p>I met him the other day in a very depressed state.</p>
<p>"Look at these munition workers," he said. "See what the
Government is doing for them. Paying them wages all the time that
they're out of work. What about me?"</p>
<p>"Well, you weren't on munitions."</p>
<p>"I have been on intellectual munitions," replied Simmons. "And
now all my editors write to me, 'Get away from the War.' I have to
transfer my machinery to peace work. I have to turn away from the
production of the German spy. Think of it. I have almost lived on
him for years. I have created hundreds of him during the War. All
my laboriously acquired knowledge of German terms&mdash;like
'<i>Schweinhund</i>,' you know&mdash;goes for nothing. I shall have
to make all my villains Bolsheviks. That will require close study
of Russia. All my old Russian knowledge goes for nothing. They have
abolished the knout and exile to Siberia. I have to start
afresh.</p>
<p>"Then look at my heroes. I have mastered the second lieutenant.
My typewriter almost automatically writes 'old top,' 'old soul,'
'old bean,' 'old egg.' All my study of this type is thrown away.
And heroines&mdash;why, I shall have to study dress again. The
hospital nurse is done for; the buxom proportions of the land-girl
avail me no more. My dear fellow, it will be six months before I
can deal with women's costume competently.</p>
<p>"And plots. How the War simplified everything. The Zep, a
failure in fact, was a splendid success in fiction. The awkward
people could be wiped out so simply. Then one's villains could die
gallantly&mdash;a bit of good in the worst of men, you
know&mdash;whispering a hurried confession in the ears of the
Company Sergeant-Major in the front trenches.</p>
<p>"Then, again, all misunderstandings were explained when the V.C.
looked up from his hospital bed. 'Eric,' she gushed, 'you here!'
And from that moment he needed no more medicine. My dear fellow, we
shall want new plots now; real plots and new characters. It will be
a long time before I can return to my pre-war standard of strong,
silent, masterful millionaires from the backwoods. Haven't I a
right to seek compensation from the Government for checking my
intellectual output?"</p>
<p>"I think the Government ought to pay you ten pounds for every
week in which you don't write," I said.</p>
<p>Simmons shook me warmly by the hand.</p>
<p>The next day he cut me dead. I believe that Simmons, though an
author of popular fiction, must have been thinking.</p>

<h3>THE BROTHER SERVICE.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>MR. PUNCH, DEAR SIR,&mdash;I am still with the Q.M.A.A.C.'s at
what used to be called the Front. But do not imagine I am cut off
from news. Papers from home pour in by every mail. I read articles
written by People Who Know, and speeches of politicians to female
electors, and that is how I have learned that it is we Women of
England who have won the War.</p>
<p>Yet out here one cannot help noticing that the War was not waged
entirely by the lovelier sex. And so I am writing to ask you to say
a word or two about the work of the Brother Service, the less
conspicuous branches of our army, the men who hauled big guns
about, who stood in trenches, who looked after ammunition, or who
killed mules to provide us with pressed beef. Little bits of the
great machinery&mdash;hangers-on of the great Women's Army
Corps&mdash;yes, but without the humble hairpin the whole coiffure
falls to the ground.</p>
<p>I have never been a pessimist or a scaremonger, but <i>without
some of these men I don't believe we women would have won the War
at all!</i></p>
<p>They ought to be encouraged, Mr. Punch. Could you not start a
Muscle Competition for the men who helped the women win the War?
Something like the Beauty Competitions for us other warriors? Why
not offer prizes to the Tommy with the biggest biceps, the
Subaltern with the thickest calf, and the Brigadier with the finest
abdominal development?</p>
<p>One is so afraid that at the next European crisis the War
Office, having learned its history from picture papers, will simply
mobilise the women and forget all about the men. Those absurd
machine guns with their wobbly legs really need a man's touch.
Besides, it would be so jolly dull without them.</p>
<p>No, the men really helped, and we ought not to forget it.</p>
<p>I hope that in years to come, when little voices in the
firelight (that's a pretty touch&mdash;who says the Army has made
us unfeminine?) beseech me, "Tell us again how you won the War,
Great-grandma," I shall retain sufficient perspective to reply,
"Granny didn't do it all alone, darlings; there were a lot of men
who helped too."</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

<h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>
<h4>LXXIX.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>My dear Charles,&mdash;Old Bowdler has been brooding again on
that idea of a brief for the defence in the forthcoming trial of
the ex-Kaiser. He rather fancies himself cross-examining with
courtesy but firmness some Generalissimo or other, or reducing to
tears by an eloquent speech a court packed with everybody who is
anybody, and in both cases having the eyes of Europe upon him and
the ears of America hanging on his next word. After all, barristers
will be barristers and, when they are, your ordinary man is no
match for 'em. It took another man of his own kind to knock the
conceit out of the idea.</p>
<p>Lack of precedent was no difficulty to Bowdler's learned
opponent. A ready imagination made up. To hear him talk you would
think he had spent his life assisting at the trials of ex-Kaisers.
He described the whole affair as if it had already taken place.
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>The culprit, he assumed, is on bail, though not, of course, on
his own recognizances. First, attention is called to the case by
Counsel for the Prosecution rising early in the sitting and asking
his Lordship if he might mention the case of WILLIAM HOHENZOLLERN,
next on his Lordship's list.</p>
<p>"William who?" asks the Clerk of Assize.</p>
<p>"WILLIAM HOHENZOLLERN," answers counsel: "H-O-H-E-N-Z-O-double
L-E-R-N."</p>
<p>A titter is heard at the idea of a man going about with a name
like that. His Lordship, regarding it as a nuisance rather than a
joke, threatens to have the court cleared. A juryman in waiting in
the gallery seizes the opportunity to ask, if anyone is to be
turned out, might it be himself.</p>
<p>Counsel goes on to mention the case. "A complicated case of
false pretences, my Lord&mdash;&mdash;," he begins. But his
solicitor plucks at his gown and points out to him that he is
confusing his briefs. Counsel apologises to the Court and asks
leave to refresh his memory. In a passionate whisper to his
solicitor he asks who is this Hohenzollern man, anyway, and why the
devil does he want to be mentioned before his time? Enlightened, he
explains to the Court that the accused has got some money together
for a dock defence and would like an opportunity to instruct his
counsel more fully.</p>
<p>His Lordship refuses a postponement; Hohen-what's-his-name
should have thought of this before. His Lordship has every
confidence in counsel's ability to pick up the facts as the case
proceeds. If counsel's personal convenience is involved that is
another matter. But as for Zohenhollern&mdash;["Hohenzollern, my
Lord"]&mdash;he cannot expect particular treatment; and that will
do, thank you.</p>
<p>The ushers start calling out for him to surrender to his bail:
"Hohenzollern! Hhhohenzollern! Owen Zollern!" re-echoes throughout
the building. "Zollern&mdash;O-N!" is heard faintly in the far
distance. No one notices that a gentleman with a fierce moustache
has already made his dramatic entry and is trying to push his way
into the dock....</p>
<p>He is stood up with half-a-dozen other prisoners, so that one
jury may be sworn for the lot. It is desired that each prisoner
should be identified with his name as it is called. WILLIAM
HOHENZOLLERN, whichever he may be, is asked to bold up his hand. An
old man in corduroys, who wears a dirty handkerchief round his neck
for collar and cravat, and is charged with feloniously stealing,
taking and carrying away his forty-first pair of boots and is also
a bit 'ard of 'earing, insists that he is the man. As nothing will
persuade him that he is not, the Clerk of Assize leaves it to the
warders to decide which of the two is which. After all it is a
small point.</p>
<p>The case is called on and WILLIAM is left in sole possession of
the dock. This is his moment, thinks he. With set features he
stands forward and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page011" id=
"page011"></a>[pg 11]</span> assumes the most important attitude
possible.</p>
<p>"Are you WILLIAM HOHENZOLLERN?" asks the Clerk of Assize.</p>
<p>There is a pause. "I am," says he.</p>
<p>Everyone turns to have a look at him. Feeling that he is
thoroughly impressing everyone WILLIAM fixes a commanding eye on
the judge, compelling, as he supposes, his utmost attention.</p>
<p>"Let's adjourn for lunch," says the judge....</p>
<p>When at last the case gets to its hearing (so far as anything at
all can be heard over the small talk in front of the dock and the
shuffle of impatient feet behind it) a novel point arises. A
witness refers to the War. "What war?" asks his Lordship. Counsel
thinks he can explain, but WILLIAM isn't for letting him. "Will you
keep silence?" says the Judge to WILLIAM. "You must call evidence
to prove that there was a war," he says to counsel.</p>
<p>WILLIAM faints upon realising that Armageddon, his masterpiece,
was such that judicial knowledge wasn't aware of it....</p>
<p>Witness after witness is called; barrister after barrister, in
the bar beneath the dock rail, goes to sleep. WILLIAM, after
shaking off the stupor caused by the awful disregard of his
personality, begins to murmur incoherently. The warder taps him on
the shoulder. WILLIAM, who has never even conceived of being tapped
by anybody, bursts out with an exclamation. The worst thing which
has ever happened to him in his life then happens. Bowdler, Bowdler
of all the un-imperial and un-godlike people in this world, turns
to WILLIAM to rebuke him in a stern whisper, telling him that he is
doing himself no good and concluding his remarks with "My
man"....</p>
<p>The trial proceeds, WILLIAM being speechless with rage. In his
ears is ringing a Hymn of Hate&mdash;hate of everybody in the
court, but particularly of Bowdler. Every time he can get his brain
to work and his tongue to work with it, he leans forward to breathe
some drastic utterance at his defending counsel. Bowdler remains
detached. WILLIAM (late Kaiser) has to realise as a cold fact that
here is a wretched mortal daring to sharpen a pencil while he is
being addressed by the ALL-HIGHEST. The ALL-HIGHEST reaches over
the dock rail to thump the wretched mortal's wretched head....</p>
<p>Bowdler rises deliberately. There is a hush. He is going to say
something important. WILLIAM feels that at last the world is sane
and duly attentive to him again. Bowdler submits that the state of
mind of the accused person (accused person!) should be inquired
into.</p>
<p>The judge very readily acquiesces; anything to get rid of the
fellow. The prison doctor swears that he has never seen a lunatic
if this isn't one. An assertive juryman, who disapproves of
business being so rushed as not to permit of a hanging, expresses
the view aloud that it is all put on. Silence ensues upon the
anomaly of a juryman daring to express a view aloud; WILLIAM avails
himself of this silence for the same purpose. His view, which was
evidently intended to take some time in the expressing, starts off
with personal reminiscences of the intimate friendship and business
partnership between himself and the Almighty. The juryman at once
gives in and the verdict is found before WILLIAM has completed his
second sentence....</p>
<p>WILLIAM hears himself being ordered "to be detained during His
Majesty's pleasure." The warder, propelling him down below stairs
to the cells, makes it quite clear to WILLIAM that the Majesty
referred to is not his (WILLIAM'S)....</p>
<p>Bowdler follows later to tell WILLIAM what a lucky fellow he is,
and also to take off him one pound, three shillings and
sixpence....</p>
<p>Yours ever, HENRY.</p>

<h2>GUARANTEED.</h2>
<p>"You recognize, of course, that the situation is exceptional,"
said Edith's mother. "You left New York on December 2, and arrived
at Euston on December 13. To-day, December 18, you ask me for my
daughter's hand, after a three days' acquaintance. Is this the
usual American pace?"</p>
<p>"That is hardly my fault," I said. "We ran into a nasty bit of
weather off Cape Race and lost twelve hours."</p>
<p>"Still," she said, "under the circumstances you will admit that
I have the right to put a few questions. Edith is all I have. She
has naturally not told me everything, but I gather you have spoken
to her a good deal about yourself."</p>
<p>"Not more than three or four hours at a sitting," I replied.</p>
<p>"And you have never spoken to anyone else as you have to
Edith?"</p>
<p>"I have."</p>
<p>"Oh," she said.</p>
<p>"I wish it had been otherwise," I pleaded; "but life is very
complex nowadays on both sides of the Atlantic. Much that I have
told Edith I have also revealed to the passport clerk at Washington
and the keeper of birth records in New York. Something too I
confided to the assistant-book-keeper in the War Zone Bureau at the
Custom-House in New York, to the cashier of the French consulate at
home, and to the gateman of Cunard Pier 54, at the foot of West
Fourteenth Street. I am sorry; I wish Edith had been the first to
whom I gave up the inner secrets of my soul, but the fact is that
to some extent she was anticipated by your Military Control-Officer
at Liverpool."</p>
<p>"It might have been worse," she sighed. "You have nice manners
and a good face. At home I suppose you are quite popular?"</p>
<p>"Up to the twenty-fifth of October I shouldn't have said so," I
replied. "But since then a great many people have taken to me. Not
quite like DORIS KEANE, you know, but still I have distributed in a
little more than a month no fewer than three dozen photographs of
myself two and a-half inches square. Your consul at New York took
two, the French Chamber of Commerce took three, and I am having
some more ready for the time when I go to make application for my
emergency ration card, in case your food department proves equally
susceptible. I have been asked out a great deal. The State
Department at Washington made me come down for several weekends and
your Military Officer at home had me in on three successive
days."</p>
<p>"Mr. Smith," she said, "you seem an honest man. Do you, in your
heart, believe yourself good enough for my Edith?"</p>
<p>"Had you asked me that six weeks ago," I said, "I should have
answered 'No.' Before I spoke to Edith, that very same question
flashed up within me. I saw the golden sheen of her hair in the
moonlight&mdash;for you do sometimes have moonlight here in
London&mdash;and wondered whether I had the right to speak. Of
course I was not good enough for her, but still I felt that I was
not altogether unfit. I might justly ask for her in the face of
high Heaven, the Passport Bureau at Washington, the War Zone Bureau
at the Custom-House, the head clerk at the Cunard office, the
watchman at the pier, the official who changed my American money
into your own very confusing monetary system, the man at the head
of the gang-plank, the man at the foot of the gang-plank, the
steward who filled my alien's declaration, the steward who gave me
my landing-card, several battalions of control officers, and
approximately half the Allied diplomatic services. When I spoke to
Edith I had all the documents in my breast-pocket, and my heart
glowed with justifiable confidence beneath them. The dear girl
never asked for my college certificate and my luggage check, but I
have them all here."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it isn't necessary," she said. "You may have her, my
dear boy."</p>
<p>"Without even looking at my Czecho-Slovak <i>vis&eacute;</i> my
club dues for 1918, and my inoculation receipt for typhoid and
paratyphoid A and B?" I stammered.</p>
<p>"You have a nice face," she said.</p>

<p><i>Second Official</i>. Then you evidently knew his name all
along. Why on earth did you ask me?</p>
<p><i>First Official</i>. You see, it's like this. I had a bet on
with a man at the Club that out of ten Government officials not
more than one would know the Minister's name. You didn't, and you
happen to be the ninth who didn't, so I've won my bet. By the way,
do you know what has become of the <i>chef</i> at the
Giorgione?</p>
<p><i>Second Official</i>. You mean old Savary, who was always
gassing about his descent from NAPOLEON'S General? I think he went
back to Paris some time ago.</p>
<p><i>First Official</i>. Thanks; then I win my second
bet&mdash;that out of ten Government officials five would know
<i>his</i> name.</p>

<h2>A CONSPIRACY IN THE POULTRY-YARD.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;I suppose it must be conceded that
practical jokes have not the vogue that they once enjoyed. No
longer do you discover some fine morning that the street in which
you live is blockaded with furniture vans, all endeavouring to
deliver furniture you don't require and never heard of before,
while your staircase is a mass of flowers and fruit constantly
increasing upon you and threatening to smother you with their
amount no less than with their scent. It would gradually appear
that the deliveries both of the flowers and the furniture were
being executed in accordance with the orders of one of your
friends, and that you had to grin and bear it as best you might. I
cannot say that the victim or the general public, when they heard
of it, looked upon it with any excess of enthusiasm. Anyhow,
practical jokes have gone out.</p>
<p>Yet there is a kind of practical joke which, so far as I know,
has never been played upon anybody, and which, if it wore played,
might provoke a considerable volume of laughter and no small
inconvenience. I have schemed it out and venture to submit the plan
to you.</p>
<p>My idea is to take some weekly magazine which caters either for
some special trade or amusement or pursuit. Let us imagine it to be
<i>The Chicken Run</i>, with which is incorporated <i>The Fowls'
Guardian</i>. I am entitled to assume that most of Mr. Punch's
readers are acquainted with this bright and lively feathered
journal. My plan is to get together some bold spirits, to capture
the editor and his staff, and to hold them in a comfortable but
rigorous imprisonment for one week; to take possession of the
editorial office, and then to set to work to transform the contents
of the paper. I foresee the amazement of the faithful readers of
<i>The Chicken Run</i>, on being informed, in the column headed
"Hints to Beginners," that Mr. LLOYD GEORGE'S pet Leghorn cockerel
has developed a surprising taste for latchkeys, and recently
swallowed two of them, while Mr. ASQUITH'S Buff Orpington pullet
has taken to following him about like a dog and roosting on his
bed-rail. Then there would be a breezy editorial article designed
to prove that poultry had come out of the war with a much enhanced
reputation, owing to the loyal part they had played in assisting
the FOOD-CONTROLLER.</p>
<p>Further, there would be special articles proving, for instance,
that champagne is the one drink on which all breeds of chickens
increase and multiply their production of eggs, especially if hot
caviare is afterwards administered in large bowls. Then there would
be the first chapters of an enthralling serial whose plot revolved
round the love-story of Sir Robert Wyandotte and Lady Cecilia
Buttercup&mdash;a literary effort of unparalleled brilliancy due to
the genius of a new novelist who preferred to be known as the Red
Rover of Rhode Island. And so on and so on. If you think the scheme
is feasible, let me hear from you and I will begin to get my team
of villains together.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>THE GAME CHICK.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>
<h4>"THE BABES IN THE WOOD."</h4>
<p>When I saw a dull red glow in the early evening sky above the
great open flares that lit the portals of the Theatre Royal, I said
to myself, "This brings the Peace home to one!" But those who think
that England will never be the same after the War, that all things
will become new and better, have not reckoned with the Drury Lane
Pantomime. Its tactics may change, but its general strategy remains
untouched by War or Peace. Under any name&mdash;<i>Ali Baba</i> or
<i>Aladdin</i>, <i>Puss in Boots</i> or <i>The Babes in the
Wood</i>&mdash;its savour is the same. If only a tenth part of the
enterprise that goes to the making of its great pageants were
devoted to the invention of a new subject, though it were only
<i>The Babes in Boots</i> or <i>Puss in the Wood</i>! However, with
Bolshevism in the air it is best perhaps not to tamper with British
institutions.</p>
<p>Still, even within the limits imposed by immemorial tradition
there surely must be somebody in the United Kingdom who could make
a better book. It was pathetic that so capable a cast&mdash;Miss
LILY LONG in particular&mdash;should have such second-rate stuff to
say and sing. Seldom could one detect any attempt to evade the
obvious. Of topical allusions, apart from timeworn themes of
coupons and profiteers, there was scarce a sign, and such burlesque
as there was had no sort of subtlety in it. Take, for example, the
opportunity lost in the imitation of a bedroom scene from modern
drama. It announced itself as something "West-Endy," yet it was
like nothing (I imagine) even in the remote Orient. And constantly
the poor play of <i>esprit</i> had to be carried off by the
distracting thud of some falling body or covered by the deadening
clash of the eternal cymbals.</p>
<p>It is significant, in this connection, that there never seems to
be any male character in these pantomimes that is not committed to
buffoonery. Apparently no reliance is placed on the unassisted
humour of the dialogue. A funny remark must be clinched with a
somersault, a repartee be driven home by a resounding smack on the
face. You might have thought that on such an occasion there would
be room for the figure of some gallant soldier of the masculine
sex. Yet there wasn't a vestige of khaki in the whole show, and the
only patriotic song assigned to a man's voice had to be delivered
by the comic villain.</p>
<p>However, the actors were too good to be defeated by the authors;
and the two couples&mdash;the <i>Babes</i> (Mr. STANLEY LUPINO as
<i>Horace</i> and Mr. WILL EVANS as <i>Flossie</i>) and the
<i>Robbers</i> (Messrs. EGBERT)&mdash;went far by their personal
drollery and unflagging spirits to make up for any defect in the
words. Each member of the two pairs played very loyally into the
other's hands. Mr. ALBERT EGBERT indeed played into his brother's
feet with equal devotion; and the good humour with which he
accepted the fiercest blows on face and person seemed to indicate
an exceptionally close fraternal understanding.</p>

</div>
<br />
<p>Mr. HARRY CLAFF as the Wicked Uncle (with a note or two in the
operatic manner) belied his villainous nature by an unusually
amiable temperament; and Miss FLORENCE SMITHSON, with her dainty
air, furnished interludes of conventional song, during which we
gave our ribs a rest.</p>
<p>The dancing, as usual, was rather perfunctory, if one excepts a
<i>pas de deux</i> which gave promise of a parody of the Russians
and turned out to be just a series of contortionist feats,
brilliant but unlovely.</p>
<p>As good wine needs no bush, so good babes need no wood; but
Messrs. McCLEERY and HUMPHRIES painted for them a quite nice one,
where, after some very pleasant business with a brace of giant
mushrooms that went up and down like a lift, the robins came and
camouflaged the wanderers under a counterpane of fallen leaves,
where they behaved much better than in ordinary beds. But the best
scene was M. MARC HENRI's Temple of Peace&mdash;very beautiful with
its dim perspective, till the garish light of "The Day" was turned
on. Here the assertive colours of the Allies were tempered to an
exquisite pale harmony, only slightly damaged by a nondescript
contingent in pink (possibly neutrals) and the apparition of Mr.
ARTHUR COLLINS and other gentlemen in black, who came on to receive
the expression of our grateful approbation.</p>
<p>I stayed long enough into the Harlequinade to see little Prince
OLAF of Norway, in QUEEN ALEXANDRA's box, capture a large cracker
dexterously flung to him by the Pantaloon. So ended for me an
evening more jocund than I have had the good grace to admit.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<h5><i>(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)</i></h5>
<p>Not infrequently our novelists will follow success with a boy
hero by a sequel showing the same character grown up. Mr. E.F.
BENSON, however, has reversed this process, and in a second book
about <i>David Blaize</i> introduces him grown not up, but down. So
far down, indeed, as to be able to pass through a door conveniently
situated under his own pillow and leading to a dreamland of the
most varied enchantments. I know, of course, what you are about to
say; I can see your lips already forming upon the word
<i>Alice</i>. But while I admit that <i>David Blaize and the Blue
Door</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) is frankly built after that famous
plan this means no more than that Mr. BENSON has used, so to speak,
the CARROLL formula as a medium for his agreeable fancies. These
are altogether original and filled with the proper dream-spirit of
inconsequence. Moreover the author has a pretty gift for
remembering just the stuff that childhood's dreams are made
of&mdash;such transfigured delights as swimming like fishes or
flying in a company of birds; he knows too the odd tags of speech
that linger there from daytime, things meaningless and full of
meaning&mdash;"Rod-pole-or-perch," for example, or that
thrice-blessed word, "Popocatapetl." Best of all, he has resisted
the subtle temptation to be even momentarily too clever for his
audience (you know the devastating effect that may be produced if a
grown-up pauses on the edge of the circle and reminds the
story-teller that he has a reputation for wit). In fine, this early
dream of <i>David's</i> shows him fortunate in having an old family
friend like Mr. Benson to write it down; also&mdash;what I must on
no account forget&mdash;so sympathetic an artist as Mr. H.J. FORD
to make it into pictures.</p>
<hr />
<p>Those who have learnt to value their "TAFFRAIL" will find matter
very much to their mind in his latest book, <i>A Little Ship</i>
(CHAMBERS). I do not wish to institute any invidious comparisons
between the marine mixture as provided by "TAFFRAIL" and that of
other nautical writers, but this much I may say with perfect
confidence: the men to be found in "TAFFRAIL'S" stories are true
human stuff, sturdy, dogged in doing their duty, and brave almost
beyond recklessness; but they are men all the time, and not solemn
and consecrated angels. That is, I suppose, why I find that
"TAFFRAIL'S" stories go straight to the mark and make their effect
with no undue waste of time; and, if a little bit of laughter is
occasionally worked in, so much the better. The last chapter in the
book gives an account of the Zeebrugge expedition. The story is so
bravely told that a man can hardly refrain from shouting in
apprehension and exultation as he reads it.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have a grudge against the publishers of <i>Miss Mink's
Soldier</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) because they have printed on its
wrapper, "By the Author of <i>Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch</i>,"
which led me, perhaps foolishly, to hope that <i>Mrs. Wiggs</i> and
I were to foregather once more, and when we didn't made me just a
little surly towards a book of short tales which, opened with any
other expectation, would have seemed much above the average. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page016" id="page016"></a>[pg
16]</span> are eight stories in the book, and in almost all of them
is found that blend of pathos and humour that Mrs. ALICE HEGAN RICE
has taught us to expect. I liked "Cupid Goes Slumming," because it
was almost <i>Cabbage Patch</i>; but "Hoodooed," the story of an
old negro who believed himself the victim of a spell which involved
the presence of a cricket in his leg, delighted me even more. His
wife removes the charm with a vacuum cleaner, in which she has
previously secreted a cricket, and the victim recovers. It pleased
me very much to learn that among "white folk's superstitions" is
the theory that it is "bad luck to sleep with the windows shet,"
and, when I come to think of it, I believe that it is very bad luck
indeed.</p>
<hr />
<p>I should have liked GABRIELLE VALLINGS' <i>Tumult</i>
(HUTCHINSON) a good deal better if she could have managed it
without the aid of a Pan who wandered, emitting a strong smell,
chiefly in the demesne of a very expensive and over-cultivated
French noble. It was his daughter (by an Australian wife) who was
suffering from an inordinate perplexity as to which half of her
blood had the real call. The Australian half suggested that she
should marry a gentleman-rider who won the Grand Prix in a canter,
but fell at the winning-post because his horse shied at the
irrepressible Pan. The French half&mdash;and both her
parents&mdash;urged a dissolute and anaemic aristocrat&mdash;blue
blood and a gold lining. Her grandfather, a strong unsilent
sheep-rancher, was against this inept decadent and converted to his
view that saintly worldling, the gorgeous <i>Cardinal
Camperioni</i>. A neo-futurist of the most bizarre type prances
through the pages upon his head, causing enough "tumult" to satisfy
any one. So why drag in Pan? Miss VALLINGS can tell a story, cannot
keep down the volume of her puppets' talk, has a sense of movement
and colour, and ought to win for herself a good circulating library
constituency.</p>
<hr />
<p>For myself I have never yet lived in a sailing barge, and under
the providence of Heaven trust to continue in this immunity. There
are however those who regard the matter differently; and for their
benefit I have no hesitation in recommending most warmly <i>A
Floating Home</i> (CHATTO AND WINDUS), written by CYRIL IONIDES and
J.B. ATKINS, and illustrated partly with photographs, partly with
water-colour sketches by that various craftsman, Mr. ARNOLD
BENNETT. Let me say at once that you have no need to be an amateur
bargee, either by practice or desire, to enjoy this most
entertaining volume. Witness my own case, who read every page of it
with delight. It is a reasonable contention that a writer
possessing the enthusiasm, the humour and the persuasive gifts of
Mr. IONIDES, with a twelve-and-sixpenny book for their display,
could present a case that would give some theoretic and superficial
charm to the most uncomfortable conditions of existence. Not that
<i>A Floating Home</i> is a work only of theory; on the contrary,
nothing could be more practical than its account of the purchase,
conversion and enjoyment of the <i>Ark Royal</i>. The most
prejudiced&mdash;again I speak personally&mdash;will find pleasure
in the author's zestful story of how the dingy, foul-smelling
<i>Will Arding</i>, full of cement (and worse things), was
transformed into the spick-and-span <i>Ark Royal</i>, with a piano
in the saloon and Queen Anne silver on the breakfast-table; while
for the persuadable there are added plans, scales of expense and
the like, which bring the whole matter to a working basis. The
book, in short, is propaganda at its best (was it perhaps this that
attracted Mr. BENNETT?) and as such well entitled to its toll of
converts.</p>
<hr />
<p><i>Warriors and Statesmen</i> (MURRAY) is a book selected from
the "gleanings" of the late Lord BRASSEY. Such gleanings depend so
largely on the personality of the gleaner that they may be worth
anything or nothing; so let me say at once that Lord BRASSEY had
too sound a taste to be a collector of ill-considered trifles.
Although warriors have the place of honour in the title they are
given but little space in the book. Still, in these days the
soldier can well afford to let the statesman have the advantage in
a collection that does not deal with the living. This limitation
may explain the absence of all mention of Lord ROBERTS, who was
probably still alive when the gleanings were completed. Apart from
the evidence it gives of a fine mind the book preserves much that
is worth remembering and presents it in a convenient form. For this
we have in part to thank Mr. HORACE HUTCHINSON, to whom Lord
BRASSEY entrusted the work of selecting these literary sheaves.</p>
<hr />
<p><i>From the Home Front</i> (CONSTABLE) is a further, and rather
belated, selection from the War verses that have appeared from week
to week on the second page of <i>Punch</i>. Conscious of cherishing
a natural prejudice in favour of his own productions, Mr. Punch
forbears to commend this little volume, but he may permit himself
to say that, in the judgment of <i>The Daily News</i>, which is
above suspicion of bias, it is calculated to provoke "a sorrow
chequered by disgust."</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
